It is the 53rd entry in the series released by Columbia Pictures starring the comedians, who released 190 shorts for the studio between 1934 and 1959. Plot The Stooges are inept but honest street cleaners. When they come across an envelope filled with oil bonds in the trash, they return them to their owner, B.O. Davis (John Tyrrell). The grateful Davis offers them a five thousand dollar reward if they can find an honest man with executive abilities. An honest dog ultimately leads them to a weeping girl (Dorothy Appleby), who explains that her sweetheart has been unfairly jailed. The best way to talk to him, the Stooges figure, is to get arrested themselves. They land in the clink and track down their man, Percy Pomeroy (Eddie Laughton). With some black paint, they make their prison outfits look like guard uniforms and make their escape. Just as they are leaving, Davis is coming in — handcuffed to a detective and revealed as \\"Lone Wolf Louie, the biggest bond swindler in America.\\" The Stooges wind up back in jail, breaking rocks over Curly's head. Cast Credited Production notes So Long Mr. Chumps was filmed on July 25–30, 1940. The film title is a parody of the film Goodbye, Mr. Chips. The jail sequences were reused in Beer Barrel Polecats. When the Stooges drop their iron balls that are chained to their legs, the sounds that are heard are again the NBC Chimes, a gag recycled from the team's 1937 short Back to the Woods. Bud Jamison appeared in a deleted scene where he was a policeman noticing the Stooges and Pomeroy's girlfriend. In the final scene, where Moe and Larry were breaking rocks over Curly's head, Larry picks up what seems to be a rather heavy rock. Curly notices the rock and replies, \\"Hey, wait a minute! That's a real one! I'm no fool.\\" Curly then chuckles, while Larry and Moe smile. Often regarded as an unscripted moment, it was later determined that exchange was scripted in advance, as it appeared in director Jules White's final shooting script. Bruce Bennett (aka Herman Brix, a former Olympic athlete and Tarzan actor) appears in dual roles as both a truck driver and as one of the guards giving orders to the Stooges.

Quinan, (July 3, 1878 – January 26, 1948) was an American born chemical engineer who settled in South Africa and contributed significantly to the British war effort in World War I by designing and building efficient explosives factories. Quinan was born in East Orange, New Jersey as the sixth son of Henry Julius Quinan who is said to have served as aide de camp to Stonewall Jackson during the American Civil WarThe Chemical Engineer\\", No. 431, December 1986, \\"Famous Men Remembered\\", Dick Dent (but no record exists of his serving on either side in the Civil War). His father's family was of Protestant Irish origin, while his mother's family, the Wickhams, were of English ancestry. Quinan had no formal qualifications in chemistry or engineering, but in 1890 he joined his uncle W.R. Quinan working in a California industrial explosives factory. Under his uncle's instruction he acquired considerable experience in the technology of explosives manufacture. W.R. Quinan was hired by Cecil Rhodes to build a factory in South Africa to supply explosives for the De Beers mines. K.B. Quinan joined him in 1901 as General Manager of the factory in Somerset West near Cape Town. By 1909, this was the second biggest explosives factory in the world. Quinan proposed that the company also manufacture glycerine, an essential ingredient in the explosives process. This plant was completed as the First World War started, assuring the mining industry and the South African economy, which largely depended on the output of the mines, would continue to be viable during the war. With the outbreak of the war, Britain required to build up its own supply of explosives for munitions. Lord Moulton, chairman of the committee on high explosives, determined that two new factories should be built. As all the British experts were already employed, he requested that an expert from South Africa be found. Quinan was selected and immediately left for Britain. He was later followed by several other senior staff from the South African factory. During the war, Quinan was responsible for the design, construction and proper operation of a number of large munitions and explosives ingredient factories in Britain. He also wrote many technical reports and even oversaw the activities of the South Africa works. In 1917, he was one of the first recipients of the Order of the Companions of Honour, and the French government awarded him the Croix de Guerre. He was offered a British knighthood but, as an American citizen, he declined. David Lloyd George publicly thanked him in the House of Commons and commented: After the end of the war, Quinan returned to South Africa where he continued his work for De Beers at the Somerset West complex. He also became the first vice-president of the Institution of Chemical Engineers. He developed several new processes and increased the output. In 1923 he married, and in 1924 he retired to operate a fruit farm. He spent his time in researching and improving the production of fruit for export, specialising in grapes. Despite his retirement he kept in contact with many of his former employees and colleagues. In 1939, with the outbreak of World War II, his expertise was again sought by the British and South African governments as an advisor on chemical defence matters and to oversee ordnance factories built in South Africa. He died at his desk at his farm on January 26, 1948.

A Hampshire gate, New Zealand gate or wire gate is a type of agricultural gate formed from a section of wire fence which can be removed temporarily. This type of gate has many different local names throughout the world, sometimes hinting at its rough- and-ready nature and cheap construction. The term \\"Hampshire gate\\" is widely used in Britain (including Hampshire) - the names of other counties are occasionally substituted, or more often that of New Zealand. In New Zealand itself it is called a Taranaki gate, while in Ireland it is known as a slap, and in Australia as a cocky's gate (\\"cocky\\" is vernacular for \\"farmer\\"), bogan gate, running gate, machinery gate or Queensland gate. In the United States it is simply called a wire gate. Though the origins of the gate are obscure, the name Taranaki Gate is believed to reflect the location of its first widespread use;Taranaki gate\\" in Collins English Dictionary. it may well have been invented independently in several places. This type of gate is used where access is only needed occasionally, or when the cost of a conventional rigid gate cannot be justified. It does not require the heavy gateposts needed to support the weight of a rigid gate, it can be adapted to a variety of terrains, it is cheap and simple to make, and if necessary it can easily be made much wider than a conventional gate. A Hampshire gate occupies a gateway in a fence similar to that used for a conventional gate. However, instead of a rigid gate, a short section of loose wire fence fits into the gap - this may consist of wire netting or barbed wire, and it usually matches the adjacent fence. One end of the wire is attached permanently to the main fence, and two or more short posts or battens keep it upright and flat - one of these is at the loose end. When the \\"gate\\" is closed, this end post fits into a loop of wire at the base of the fixed fence, and the top is then pulled tight to tension it. The top of the post may be held by another loop of wire, or additional tension may be provided by a length of chain looped around the post and hooked onto a nail. Proprietary closures are also available which give still greater tension, usually by means of an over-centre mechanism (see photo below). If use is likely to be very rare (perhaps only in emergencies), the gate may be wired shut for security - an emergency then only requires the cutting of the securing wire, not cutting the fence itself. When open, the Hampshire gate is folded back against the adjacent fence to avoid it becoming entangled with animals, people or machinery. Typical uses for a Hampshire gate include giving occasional access between adjacent landowners, giving access to small woods for forestry operations, rotational grazing, or allowing unusually large traffic to bypass a normal route. In the American West, it is extremely common in rural areas, particularly on ranches, where it is the most frequently used type of gate used between pastures, and in fencelines separating rangeland of different owners, or separating public and private land.

As an undergraduate he became a friend of Rowland Hill and he was also a close friend of John Wesley, the founder of Methodism. Career Monument to David Simpson in Christ Church, Macclesfield In September 1769 Simpson was ordained deacon and worked as a curate in Ramsden Bellhouse, Essex. In 1771 he was ordained priest and became curate at Buckingham. However he was forced to leave this position within one year because of his evangelical preaching. He was invited to move to Macclesfield by Charles Roe, a local evangelical industrialist, and was appointed assistant curate at St Michael's Church. His subsequent promotion to prime curacy was opposed by a group of parishioners and Roe built a new church for him, Christ Church. Simpson was licensed in 1779 and he continued as minister of this church until his death in 1799. As a result of his friendship with John Wesley, Wesley was invited to preach at Christ Church on at least 12 occasions, which was unusual for an Anglican church. In addition to his ministry at Christ Church he was also an itinerant preacher locally. He founded friendly societies, charity schools and Sunday schools and attracted large congregations. He was a pioneer of congregational hymn-singing and published a collection of hymns in 1776. He was a prolific author, publishing over 30 works, which included sermons, tracts, essays, and volumes of apologetic. Some of his collected writings are held in the library of St John's College, Cambridge. Personal life Simpson married Ann Yaldy in May 1773 but she died 15 months later, leaving a daughter. He then married Elizabeth Davy in 1776; they had three children. He died on Easter Sunday 1799 and was buried two days later at Christ Church.

Early life  He was born William Cornwallis West. He was a son of Theresa John Cornwallis West (née Whitby) and Frederick Richard West, a Tory MP for Denbigh Boroughs and East Grinstead who was a member of the Canterbury Association. His father was first married to Lady Georgiana Stanhope (a daughter of Philip Stanhope, 5th Earl of Chesterfield). His paternal grandfather was the Hon. Frederick West (a younger son of John West, 2nd Earl De La Warr). His maternal grandparents were John Whitby and Mary Anne Theresa Symonds (heiress to the fortune of Admiral William Cornwallis).Theresa Cornwallis-West, nee Whitby, erected a memorial to the 6th Earl De La Warr (1815-1873); his death was otherwise not memorialized as he was a suicide. Understandably, speculation remains on the relationship between the unmarried earl and this heiress. He was called to the Bar, Lincoln's Inn, in 1862.  Career  Cornwallis-West was High Sheriff of Denbighshire in 1872, Lord-Lieutenant of Denbighshire from 1872 to 1917, a Justice of the Peace for Hampshire and Denbighshire and an Honorary Colonel in the 4th Battalion of the Royal Welch Fusiliers. In 1885 he was returned to Parliament for Denbighshire West, a seat he held until 1892. In 1895 he assumed by deed poll the surname of Cornwallis-West. He lived at Ruthin Castle, Denbighshire, and at Newlands Manor, Milford, Hampshire.Historical faces from Milford on Sea  Personal life  Cornwallis-West married Mary (\\"Patsy\\"), daughter of Reverend Frederick Fitzpatrick, in 1872. Born in 1856, \\"Patsy\\" was 17 years old. She was known as a great beauty and leading socialite. They were the parents of: * Daisy Cornwallis-West (1873–1943), who married Prince Hans Heinrich XV von Hochberg. * George Cornwallis-West (1874–1951), who was the second husband of Lady Randolph Churchill (the American heiress formerly known as Jennie Jerome), mother of Winston Churchill. After their 1914 divorce, he married Mrs Patrick Campbell. * Constance Cornwallis-West (1875–1970), who married Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster. They divorced and she married her private secretary and agent, Captain John Fitzpatrick Lewis. Cornwallis-West died in July 1917, aged 82.

It had been the intention to exhibit a higher specification model for Ham's of Flimwell, but this was not ready in time for the show, meaning the bus didn't show its full potential. The Olympus replaced the OmniDekka on Scania chassis, which is 10.6 or 11.9 metres in length. On Volvo chassis, it replaced the Myllennium Vyking. On Alexander Dennis chassis, it replaced the Myllennium Lolyne. At the beginning of January 2007, Reading Buses ordered six Olympus with Scania chassis for their Loddon Bridge FastTrack park and ride contract to replace Optare Excels. They entered service in a yellow and blue livery in July 2007. In London, some bus operators purchased Olympus with Scania chassis. Transdev London and Metroline had these buses operating on routes 148, 7 and 297 respectively. Due to problems with the new Transport for London specified air-conditioning units, some buses failed the tilt test by one degree, and entered service late. Darwen Olympus East Lancs went into administration in August 2007 and was bought by the Darwen Group. The body was therefore renamed Darwen Olympus. The first buses to be delivered under the Darwen name were those ordered by Cardiff Bus (one of which was shown at Coach and Bus live 2007) and Arriva Yorkshire. Reading Buses has numerous examples bodied by Darwen, in addition to a few built by East Lancs before they went into administration.

The full report can be found on the United Nations website listed in the external links. The International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur (henceforth the Commission) was established pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1564 (2004), adopted on 18 September 2004. The resolution, passed under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, urged the Secretary-General to set up an international commission to investigate human rights violations committed in Darfur. The following month, the Secretary-General appointed a five-member panel of highly regarded legal experts: chairperson Antonio Cassese, Mohammed Fayek, Hina Jilani, Dumisa Ntsebeza and Thérèse Striggner Scott. The Secretary-General decided that the Commission’s staff would be provided by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Ms Mona Rishmawi was appointed Executive Director of the Commission and head of its staff. The Commission assembled in Geneva and began its work on 25 October 2004. The Secretary-General requested that the Commission report to him within three months, i.e. by 25 January 2005. Details Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, on 18 September 2004 the Security Council adopted Resolution 1564 requesting, inter alia, that the Secretary-General ‘rapidly establish an international commission of inquiry in order immediately to investigate reports of violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law in Darfur by all parties, to determine also whether or not acts of genocide have occurred, and to identify the perpetrators of such violations with a view to ensuring that those responsible are held accountable’. In October 2004, the Secretary General appointed Antonio Cassese (Chairperson), Mohamed Fayek, Hina Jilani, Dumisa Ntsebeza and Therese Striggner-Scott as members of the Commission and requested that they report back on their findings within three months. The Commission was supported in its work by a Secretariat headed by an Executive Director, Ms. Mona Rishmawi, as well as a legal research team and an investigative team composed of investigators, forensic experts, military analysts, and investigators specializing in gender violence, all appointed by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. The Commission assembled in Geneva and began its work on 25 October 2004. In order to discharge its mandate, the Commission endeavored to fulfill four key tasks: (1) to investigate reports of violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law in Darfur by all parties; (2) to determine whether or not acts of genocide have occurred; (3) to identify the perpetrators of violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law in Darfur; and (4) to suggest means of ensuring that those responsible for such violations are held accountable. While the Commission considered all events relevant to the current conflict in Darfur, it focused in particular on incidents that occurred between February 2003 and mid-January 2005. The Commission engaged in a regular dialogue with the Government of the Sudan throughout its mandate, in particular through meetings in Geneva and in the Sudan, as well as through the work of its investigative team. The Commission visited the Sudan from 7–21 November 2004 and 9–16 January 2005, including travel to the three Darfur States. The investigative team remained in Darfur from November 2004 through January 2005. During its presence in the Sudan, the Commission held extensive meetings with representatives of the Government, the Governors of the Darfur States and other senior officials in the capital and at provincial and local levels, members of the armed forces and police, leaders of rebel forces, tribal leaders, internally displaced persons, victims and witnesses of violations, NGOs and United Nations representatives. The Commission submitted a full report on its findings to the Secretary-General on 25 January 2005. The report describes the terms of reference, methodology, approach and activities of the Commission and its investigative team. It also provides an overview of the historical and social background to the conflict in Darfur. The report then addresses in detail the four key tasks referred to above, namely the Commission’s findings in relation to: i) violations of international human rights and humanitarian law by all parties; ii) whether or not acts of genocide have taken place; iii) the identification of perpetrators; and iv) accountability mechanisms. These four sections are briefly summarized below. Violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law In accordance with its mandate to ‘investigate reports of violations of human rights law and international humanitarian law’, the Commission carefully examined reports from different sources including Governments, inter- governmental organizations, United Nations bodies and mechanisms, as well as non-governmental organizations. The Commission took as the starting point for its work two irrefutable facts regarding the situation in Darfur. Firstly, according to United Nations estimates there are 1,65 million internally displaced persons in Darfur, and more than 200,000 refugees from Darfur in neighbouring Chad. Secondly, there has been large-scale destruction of villages throughout the three states of Darfur. The Commission conducted independent investigations to establish additional facts and gathered extensive information on multiple incidents of violations affecting villages, towns and other locations across North, South and West Darfur. The conclusions of the Commission are based on the evaluation of the facts gathered or verified through its investigations. Based on a thorough analysis of the information gathered in the course of its investigations, the Commission established that the Government of the Sudan and the Janjaweed are responsible for serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law amounting to crimes under international law. In particular, the Commission found that Government forces and militias conducted indiscriminate attacks, including killing of civilians, torture, enforced disappearances, destruction of villages, rape and other forms of sexual violence, pillaging and forced displacement, throughout Darfur. These acts were conducted on a widespread and systematic basis, and therefore may amount to crimes against humanity. The extensive destruction and displacement have resulted in a loss of livelihood and means of survival for countless women, men and children. In addition to the large scale attacks, many people have been arrested and detained, and many have been held incommunicado for prolonged periods and tortured. The vast majority of the victims of all of these violations have been from the Fur, Zaghawa, Massalit, Jebel, Aranga and other so-called ‘African’ tribes. In their discussions with the Commission, Government of the Sudan officials stated that any attacks carried out by Government armed forces in Darfur were for counter-insurgency purposes and were conducted on the basis of military imperatives. However, it is clear from the Commission’s findings that most attacks were deliberately and indiscriminately directed against civilians. Moreover, even if rebels, or persons supporting rebels, were present in some of the villages – which the Commission considers likely in only a very small number of instances - the attackers did not take precautions to enable civilians to leave the villages or otherwise be shielded from attack. Even where rebels may have been present in villages, the impact of the attacks on civilians shows that the use of military force was manifestly disproportionate to any threat posed by the rebels. The Commission is particularly alarmed that attacks on villages, killing of civilians, rape, pillaging and forced displacement have continued during the course of the Commission’s mandate. The Commission considers that action must be taken urgently to end these violations. While the Commission did not find a systematic or a widespread pattern to these violations, it found credible evidence that rebel forces, namely members of the SLM and JEM, also are responsible for serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law which may amount to war crimes. In particular, these violations include cases of murder of civilians and pillage. Have acts of genocide occurred? The Commission concluded that the Government of the Sudan has not pursued a policy of genocide. Arguably, two elements of genocide might be deduced from the gross violations of human rights perpetrated by Government forces and the militias under their control. These two elements are, first, the actus reus consisting of killing, or causing serious bodily or mental harm, or deliberately inflicting conditions of life likely to bring about physical destruction; and, second, on the basis of a subjective standard, the existence of a protected group being targeted by the authors of criminal conduct. However, the crucial element of genocidal intent appears to be missing, at least as far as the central Government authorities are concerned. Generally speaking the policy of attacking, killing and forcibly displacing members of some tribes does not evince a specific intent to annihilate, in whole or in part, a group distinguished on racial, ethnic, national or religious grounds. Rather, it would seem that those who planned and organized attacks on villages pursued the intent to drive the victims from their homes, primarily for purposes of counter-insurgency warfare. The Commission does recognize that in some instances individuals, including Government officials, may commit acts with genocidal intent. Whether this was the case in Darfur, however, is a determination that only a competent court can make on a case by case basis. The conclusion that no genocidal policy has been pursued and implemented in Darfur by the Government authorities, directly or through the militias under their control, should not be taken in any way as detracting from the gravity of the crimes perpetrated in that region. International offences such as the crimes against humanity and war crimes that have been committed in Darfur may be no less serious and heinous than genocide. Identification of perpetrators The Commission has collected reliable and consistent elements which indicate the responsibility of some individuals for serious violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law, including crimes against humanity or war crimes, in Darfur. In order to identify perpetrators, the Commission decided that there must be ‘a reliable body of material consistent with other verified circumstances, which tends to show that a person may reasonably be suspected of being involved in the commission of a crime.’ The Commission therefore makes an assessment of likely suspects, rather than a final judgment as to criminal guilt. Those identified as possibly responsible for the above-mentioned violations consist of individual perpetrators, including officials of the Government of Sudan, members of militia forces, members of rebel groups, and certain foreign army officers acting in their personal capacity. Some Government officials, as well as members of militia forces, have also been named as possibly responsible for joint criminal enterprise to commit international crimes. Others are identified for their possible involvement in planning and/or ordering the commission of international crimes, or of aiding and abetting the perpetration of such crimes. The Commission also has identified a number of senior Government officials and military commanders who may be responsible, under the notion of superior (or command) responsibility, for knowingly failing to prevent or repress the perpetration of crimes. Members of rebel groups are named as suspected of participating in a joint criminal enterprise to commit international crimes, and as possibly responsible for knowingly failing to prevent or repress the perpetration of crimes committed by rebels. The Commission has decided to withhold the names of these persons from the public domain. This decision is based on three main grounds: 1) the importance of the principles of due process and respect for the rights of the suspects; 2) the fact that the Commission has not been vested with investigative or prosecutorial powers; and 3) the vital need to ensure the protection of witnesses from possible harassment or intimidation. The Commission instead will list the names in a sealed file that will be placed in the custody of the UN Secretary-General. The Commission recommends that this file be handed over to a competent Prosecutor (the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, according to the Commission’s recommendations), who will use that material as he or she deems fit for his or her investigations. A distinct and very voluminous sealed file, containing all the evidentiary material collected by the Commission, will be handed over to the High Commissioner for Human Rights. This file should be delivered to a competent Prosecutor. Accountability mechanisms The Commission strongly recommends that the Security Council immediately refer the situation of Darfur to the International Criminal Court, pursuant to article 13(b) of the ICC Statute. As repeatedly stated by the Security Council, the situation constitutes a threat to international peace and security. Moreover, as the Commission has confirmed, serious violations of international human rights law and humanitarian law by all parties are continuing. The prosecution by the ICC of persons allegedly responsible for the most serious crimes in Darfur would contribute to the restoration of peace in the region. The alleged crimes that have been documented in Darfur meet the thresholds of the Rome Statute as defined in articles 7 (1), 8 (1) and 8 (f). There is an internal armed conflict in Darfur between the governmental authorities and organized armed groups. A body of reliable information indicates that war crimes may have been committed on a large-scale, at times even as part of a plan or a policy. There is also a wealth of credible material which suggests that criminal acts were committed as part of widespread or systematic attacks directed against the civilian population, with knowledge of the attacks. In the opinion of the Commission therefore, these may amount to crimes against humanity. The Sudanese justice system is unable and unwilling to address the situation in Darfur. This system has been significantly weakened during the last decade. Restrictive laws that grant broad powers to the executive have undermined the effectiveness of the judiciary, and many of the laws in force in Sudan today contravene basic human rights standards. Sudanese criminal laws do not adequately proscribe war crimes and crimes against humanity, such as those carried out in Darfur, and the Criminal Procedure Code contains provisions that prevent the effective prosecution of these acts. In addition, many victims informed the Commission that they had little confidence in the impartiality of the Sudanese justice system and its ability to bring to justice the perpetrators of the serious crimes committed in Darfur. In any event, many have feared reprisals in the event that they resort to the national justice system. The measures taken so far by the Government to address the crisis have been both grossly inadequate and ineffective, which has contributed to the climate of almost total impunity for human rights violations in Darfur. Very few victims have lodged official complaints regarding crimes committed against them or their families, due to a lack of confidence in the justice system. Of the few cases where complaints have been made, most have not been properly pursued. Furthermore, procedural hurdles limit the victims’ access to justice. Despite the magnitude of the crisis and its immense impact on civilians in Darfur, the Government informed the Commission of very few cases of individuals who have been prosecuted, or even disciplined, in the context of the current crisis. The Commission considers that the Security Council must act not only against the perpetrators but also on behalf of the victims. It therefore recommends the establishment of a Compensation Commission designed to grant reparation to the victims of the crimes, whether or not the perpetrators of such crimes have been identified. It further recommends a number of serious measures to be taken by the Government of the Sudan, in particular (i) ending the impunity for the war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Darfur; (ii) strengthening the independence and impartiality of the judiciary, and empowering courts to address human rights violations; (iii) granting full and unimpeded access by the International Committee of the Red Cross and United Nations human rights monitors to all those detained in relation to the situation in Darfur; (iv) ensuring the protection of all the victims and witnesses of human rights violations; (v) enhancing the capacity of the Sudanese judiciary through the training of judges, prosecutors and lawyers; (vi) respecting the rights of IDPs and fully implementing the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, particularly with regard to facilitating the voluntary return of IDPs in safety and dignity; (vii) fully cooperating with the relevant human rights bodies and mechanisms of the United Nations and the African Union; and (viii) creating, through a broad consultative process, a truth and reconciliation commission once peace is established in Darfur. The Commission also recommends a number of measures to be taken by other bodies to help break the cycle of impunity. These include the exercise of universal jurisdiction by other States, re-establishment by the Commission on Human Rights of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on human rights in Sudan, and public and periodic reports on the human rights situation in Darfur by the High Commissioner for Human Rights.

Harris earned a Bachelor of Arts in Biology from Lincoln University in Pennsylvania in 1971 and a Ph.D. in genetics from Cornell University in 1975. Harris worked her way up from a postdoctoral position to being the president and genetics consultant of her own company, Harris & Associates, Ltd in Atlanta, Georgia.  Early life  Harris was born in Nashville, Tennessee on June 26, 1949 to George and Margaret Styles. Her mother, Margaret, completed a degree in business administration at Tennessee State University. George was a doctor, and it was his career that sparked Harris' early interest in science. George died when Harris was 9 years old. When Harris entered Miami Jackson High School she was one of the first African Americans to enroll. In 1967, she graduated twelfth in her class of 350.  Education  At Lincoln University in Pennsylvania Harris was one of the first women to enroll. Men in her advanced algebra and organic chemistry classes were surprised to see Harris there. She spent most of her time with pre-med students, with the goal of attending medical school. Her father's colleagues reserved Harris a place at the University of Miami Medical School, but she did not accept it. She did not want to treat people, she wanted to do research. Harris graduated from Lincoln University in 1971, and then enrolled at Cornell University where she studied molecular genetics and was supported by a Ford Foundation Doctoral Fellowship. Harris graduated with her doctorate in 1975 and was a Research Associate studying the virology of tumors in the medical school at Rutgers University from 1975-77.  Career  After graduating from Cornell, Harris became executive director of the Sickle Cell Foundation of Georgia in 1977. In this role she was responsible for raising money for sickle cell research and educating the public on the disease. Harris later became the Director of Genetic Services for the Georgia Department of Human Services. During this time Harris also served as an Assistant Professor at Morehouse College (1978) and Atlanta College (1980-1981). In 1987 Harris founded BioTechnical Communications. Her work focused on producing health education digital materials primarily for minority women. Harris has dedicated her professional life to researching and providing health care information and education for the minority population. She has spent most of her professional career involved in the application and transfer of basic research to the health care field. Harris has experience as a graduate and medical school teacher and she has had articles published in scientific and medical journals. Harris has directed a statewide screening program, been on grant review committees, and has provided private consulting for private laboratories and health organizations. Harris has produced television and radio shows, and she hosts a call-in radio show, Journey To Wellness: African American Health Radio and developed a documentary, To My Sisters... A Gift For Life, focusing on breast cancer in African American Women. Harris' interest in preventive health care led her to get involved in new born screening of Sickle-cell disease and sitting on the Atlanta board of the March of Dimes.

He founded the private banking house Koppel und Co., the industrial firms Auergesellschaft and OSRAM, and the philanthropic foundation the Koppel-Stiftung. He was a Senator in the Kaiser- Wilhelm-Gesellschaft. An endowment he made in 1911 resulted in the founding of the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut für physikalische Chemie und Elektrochemie, and endowments from him led to the founding of and support of the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut für Physik. He was a target of the Third Reich’s policy of Arisierung – the Aryanization of German businesses, which began in 1933. Career Koppel was a Jewish banker and entrepreneur. In recognition of his contributions to German commerce, he was given the title Geheimer Kommerzienrat (Privy Councillor of Commerce), or, in short, Geheimrat.Koppel – Obituary, Berlin. In 1890, Koppel opened his private banking house Koppel und Co.Kreutzmüller, 2005, 27. In 1892, with the Austrian chemist and inventor Carl Auer von Welsbach, Koppel founded the Deutsche Gasglühlichtgesellschaft- Aktiengesellschaft (Degea or DGA, German Gas Light Company), the forerunner of Auergesellschaft. Koppel was the controlling owner. In 1906, DGA developed the OSRAM light bulb; its name was formed from the German words OSmium, for the element osmium, and WolfRAM, for the element tungsten. As the owner of the OSRAM trademark, Koppel separated the light bulb manufacturing from DGA in 1918, forming the OSRAM Werke GmbH, after which the new company was converted into a Kommanditgesellschaft (limited partnership), with DGA as the limited partner. Since Koppel was the majority shareholder in DGA, he thus became the chief partner in the new company. In February 1920, DGA merged its light bulb manufacturing with that of Allgemeine Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft (AEG) and Siemens & Halske and they became limited partners under OSRAM G.m.b.H. KG; the start of the business year was dated retroactively to 1 July 1919. Koppel (DGA) owned 20% of the OSRAM G.m.b.H. KG stock, and the other two companies each owned 40%.100 Jahre OSRAM p. 26.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix D; see the entry for Auergesellschaft. In 1905, Koppel established the Koppel- Stiftung zur Förderung der geistigen Beziehungen Deutschlands zum Ausland (Koppel Foundation for the Promotion of Scientific Relations Abroad). Through this foundation, he promoted German scientific research and development, which in turn benefited German industry and manufacturing.KWIPC.Macrakis, 1993, 19. The Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft (KWG, Kaiser Wilhelm Society) was founded in 1911 to promote the sciences in Germany, especially by establishing research institutions under its umbrella; after World War II, the organization was renamed the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, in honor of Max Planck. That same year, the Koppel-Stiftung contributed an endowment of 1 million Marks towards the founding of the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut für physikalische Chemie und Elektrochemie (KWIPC, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Elektrochemistry) in Berlin-Dahlem. The endowment was given with Koppel’s condition that its director be the Jewish chemist and Nobel Laureate Fritz Haber; Haber was director from then until 1933; after World War II, the Institute was renamed the Fritz-Haber-Institut der Max-Planck- Gesellschaft.Kreutzmüller, 2005, 28.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, 227 and Appendix A: See the entry for KWIPC.Macrakis, 1993, 19 and 22. From 1913, the Koppel-Stiftung donated money for the salary of Albert Einstein at the Preußische Akademie der Wissenschaften (Prussian Academy of Sciences) so that Einstein would not be required to teach and be able to focus his attention on theoretical research. This supplemental salary was continued for 13 years, and it was instrumental in the founding of the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut für Physik (KWIP, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics).Clark, 1971, 179-180.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1196, 19. The Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft had a Senat (Senate, i.e., supervisory board) composed of members from fields including finance, industry, science, and politics.

When Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, the Third Reich initiated Arisierung, a policy of Aryanization of German businesses. As a consequence of this, Koppel was forced to divest himself of Auergesellschaft and his banking house. The German corporation Degussa took control of Auergesellschaft in 1934; Degussa was a large chemical company with extensive experience in the production of metals.Riel and Seitz, 1996, 10.Arisierung – Deutsches Historisches Museum.

In 1984, the wing was consolidated with the 392d Bombardment Group During World War II, the 392d Group, its predecessor unit, was an Eighth Air Force Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bombardment group. The group flew combat missions from RAF Wendling in England, earning a Distinguished Unit Citation. The group flew 285 combat missions, suffering 1,552 casualties including 835 killed in action or line of duty and 184 aircraft lost. After VE Day the group returned to the United States and flew airlift missions until inactivated in September 1945. The group was reactivated in the Air Force Reserve in 1947 as a very heavy bomber group. In 1949, it converted to a light bomber group and was assigned to the wing under the wing base organization system.

Activated 26 January 1943 at Davis Monthan AAFd, Arizona, and trained there until February 1943. The unit moved to Biggs Field, Texas, and on March 1943, and then to Alamogordo AAB, New Mexico on 18 April 1943. The ground unit left for the New York Port of Embarkation on 18 July 1943. The unit sailed out from New York on 25 July 1943, and arrived in England on 30 July 1943. Assigned to the Eighth Air Force at RAF Wendlingin East Anglia. The group was assigned to the 14th Combat Bombardment Wing, and the group tail code was a \\"Circle-D\\". The 392d BG entered combat on 9 September 1943 and engaged primarily in bombardment of strategic objectives on the Continent until April 1945. The group attacked such targets as an oil refinery at Gelsenkirchen, a marshalling yard at Osnabrück, a railroad viaduct at Bielefeld, steel plants at Brunswick, a tank factory at Kassel, and gas works at Berlin. The group took part in the intensive campaign of heavy bombers against the German aircraft industry during Big Week, 20–25 February 1944, being awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation for bombing an aircraft and component parts factory at Gotha on 24 February. The unit sometimes supported ground forces or carried out interdictory operations along with bombing airfields and V-weapon sites in France prior to the Normandy invasion in June 1944 and struck coastal defenses and choke points on D-Day. The group hit enemy positions to assist ground forces at Saint-Lô during the breakthrough in July 1944. Bombed railroads, bridges, and highways to cut off German supply lines during the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944 – January 1945. Dropped supplies to Allied troops during the air attack on the Netherlands in September 1944 and during the airborne assault across the Rhine in March 1945. The 392d Bomb Group flew its last combat mission on 25 April 1945, then carried food to the Dutch. The unit returned to Charleston AAF South Carolina on 25 June 1945 and was inactivated on 13 September 1945. Redeployed to the US May/June 1945. First of the aircraft departed the United Kingdom on 29 May 1945. Ground echelon sailed on Queen Mary on 15 June 1945, arriving in New York on 20 June 1945.

Opálka was born into a middle-class family in Rešice and joined the Czechoslovak Army in 1936 where he served in the 43rd Infantry Regiment in Brno. The Munich Agreement and subsequent German occupation of Czechoslovakia led to the disbanding of the Czechoslovak Army, and Opálka's career ended. He escaped to North Africa where he served in the French Foreign Legion, and he later returned to France. He then joined the Out Distance group and participated in Operation Anthropoid. He was found days later by the Nazis, and he committed suicide in the Church of Saints Cyril and Methodius in Prague after a gunfight in which he was injured. Early life Opálka was born in Rešice near Dukovany the illegitimate son of miller Viktor Jarolím (1889–1942) of Tulešice and Anežka Opálková. When his mother died in 1923, Opálka lived with his aunt Marie Opálková (1882–1942). Between 1932 and 1936, Opálka studied at the Commercial Academy and, shortly after his graduation in 1936, he joined the army of Czechoslovakia. After recruitment and training, he was assigned to the 43rd Infantry Regiment in Brno and shortly afterwards attended the Army Academy in Hranice. After graduation, Opálka joined the 2nd Mountain Regiment in Ružomberok as a lieutenant. The Munich Agreement ended Opálka's army career in his homeland, and he left Czechoslovakia with his cousin František Pospíšil. First travelling through Poland and France, they fled to North Africa, where they joined the French Foreign Legion. Opálka served in Sidi Bel Abbes as a sergeant of the 1st Infantry Regiment. Later, he joined Senegal's Gunmen in Oran. Opálka's fiancée spoke about this period of his life: World War II After the start of World War II and the occupation of Czechoslovakia, Opálka returned to France from Africa and joined a developing Czechoslovak army in Agde, serving as leader of an infantry platoon of the 2nd Infantry Regiment of the 1st Czechoslovak Infantry Division. In January 1940, he was transferred to the 3rd Infantry Division and commanded the 5th Infantry Battalion. On 12 July 1940, when France was defeated, Opálka sailed on the troopship to the United Kingdom and as an unfiled officer served in a machine gun platoon. In the summer of 1941, he volunteered as a soldier for covert operations behind enemy lines. He had been trained in Scotland in Special Training Schools. Afterwards, he became leader of the group codenamed \\"Out Distance\\". Out Distance Opálka (cover name \\"Adolf Král\\"), Ivan Kolařík (\\"Jan Krátký\\"), and Karel Čurda (\\"Karel Vrbas\\") secretly parachuted into the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia on 28 March 1942 to perform covert operations including bomber navigation and sabotage. The operations of Out Distance were complicated from the beginning. A navigational mistake by the Handley Page Halifax plane bringing them in caused the entire group to be dropped at the wrong location. This, together with the loss of equipment, led to the splitting up of the group. Opálka contacted captain Alfréd Bartoš from the group Silver-A and informed him of the situation. He later joined the group gathered around Operation Anthropoid in Prague and became leader of the Prague parachuters. Operation Anthropoid Crypt of the Church of Saints Cyril and Methodius, Prague Operation Anthropoid involved a plot to kill Reinhard Heydrich, the Reichsprotektor of wartime Bohemia and Moravia with a modified anti-tank grenade. After the mission was carried out, Opálka and his six fellow combatants (Josef Bublík, Jozef Gabčík, Jan Hrubý, Jan Kubiš, Josef Valčík, and Jaroslav Švarc) were tracked to the Church of St. Cyril and St. Methodious in Prague. At 16:15 on 18 June 1942, the church was besieged by 800 soldiers of the German army and Waffen-SS. After a seven-hour fight, the outnumbered group of paratroopers fell. All died, including First Lieutenant Adolf Opálka who, injured by shrapnel, committed suicide. Shortly after his departure, on his 27th birthday, Opálka wrote of homesickness: After the mission of the paratroopers, the Nazis unleashed strong reprisals. Opálka's aunt, Marie Opálková, was executed in Mauthausen on 24 October 1942. His father, Viktor Jarolím, was also killed.

I assure you, Madame, that she will make a good Superior some day.\\"Architect of the Capitol-Art \\"Mother Joseph\\" She took the name Sister Joseph in honor of her father.HistoryLink.org, \\"Mother Joseph of the Sisters of Providence (Esther Pariseau) (1823-1902),\\" HistoryLink.org Essay 5483 In 1856 Augustin-Magloire Blanchet, the bishop of the new Diocese of Nesqually (now the Archdiocese of Seattle), approached the Sisters of Providence in Montreal, seeking their assistance for his diocese in the Pacific Northwest Territories of the United States. Mother Joseph was chosen to lead four companions as missionaries to that region. Accompanied by the bishop, they spent over a month traveling by train from Montreal, arriving on the 8 December of that year. They arrived only to find that the Vicar General had expected them to settle elsewhere and had not made arrangements for their housing. Their first days were spent sleeping in the attic of the bishop's small home. Within a few months, the Sisters had made their home in Vancouver, Washington. A small cabin served as both their convent and first school, which opened 14 April 1857. They accepted into their care several orphans and an elderly man who was homeless. Bishop Blanchet gave them two acres on the St. James Mission Claim, and on this land a small group of multi-purpose buildings sprang up. The Sisters named their new home Providence of the Holy Angels. Over the next few years, it housed the convent, novitiate, and infirmary, an orphanage for both boys and girls, a boarding and day school, rooms for the elderly and insane and the first St. Joseph Hospital. The Sisters also cared for the clergy of St. James Cathedral, as well as visiting the poor and sick in their homes. The diocese became involved in a long dispute over ownership of the St. James Mission Claim, so it was not to become the Sisters' permanent mission site. Instead, Mother Joseph purchased property away from the disputed area and protected the Sisters' interests through incorporation as the \\"Sisters of Charity of the House of Providence in the Territory of Washington\\" on 28 January 1859. It remains one of Washington State's oldest corporations and the parent corporation for Providence Health & Services.Providence Health & Services \\"About Providence\\" In the early 1870s, Mother Joseph began planning a permanent home for Providence of the Holy Angels on the property she had purchased earlier in Vancouver. She designed and supervised construction of Providence Academy, bounded by Tenth and Twelfth, \\"C\\" and Reserve Streets. The local Hidden Brick Company supplied the bricks for the four-story structure. The sisters and their orphans and boarders moved into the Academy on 7 September 1874, before the interior was finished. Mother Joseph supervised construction of a large addition in 1891, but otherwise the exterior of the building remains much as it was built. A stickler for detail, Mother Joseph often inspected foundations, rafters and bounced on planks to ensure their support. As architect and artist, she was responsible for designing some of the buildings and supervising their construction. She undertook aggressive fundraising tours, braving the mountains and wilderness on horseback. Each of her \\"begging tours\\" into mining camps lasted several months and raised between $2,000 and $5,000 toward the realization of her goal. A brief timeline of what buildings Mother Joseph was involved in building; 1856 Providence Academy, Vancouver, Wash. 1858 St. Joseph Hospital , Vancouver. 1863 Providence St. Joseph (school), Steilacoom, Wash. 1864 St. Vincent Academy Walla Walla, Wash. (“Mother Joseph of the Sacred Heart, Sister of Providence.” The First American Women Architects, by Sarah Allaback, University of Illinois Press, 2008, pp. 153–156.) The tours were not without danger from highwaymen either. She almost lost all of her proceeds from a recent tour in 1866 when she and her stage stopped suddenly by armed men and robbed at gunpoint. She reported to have put up a convincing ruse, telling the highwayman, \\"There is nothing in there that you would want.\\" The tours took her far from Vancouver even unto the interior of Idaho and Montana, being plump with money from the many mines located there. Later her compatriots from Ohio would establish Indian Mission Schools in Montana. Mother Joseph effectively supported their multiple institutions while her superiors in Montreal did not have an abundance of resources to support them, a testament to her tenacity and dedication to the service of others. Mother Joseph died of a brain tumor on 19 January 1902, at Providence Academy in Vancouver, Washington and is buried in nearby Mother Joseph Cemetery. While she left a legacy of humanitarian service, it is not true (as has been widely reported) that the American Institute of Architects declared Mother Joseph \\"The First Architect of the Pacific Northwest.\\" However, she did plan and build some of the region's first permanent institutions of learning and medical care. Homage In 1980, the state of Washington recognized her many talents and contributions by naming her as one of the state's two representatives to the U.S. Capitol's National Statuary Hall Collection. A bronze statue of Mother Joseph, created by Felix W. de Weldon, was given to the collection of the Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol. The campaign to add Mother Joseph to the US Statuary hall met great opposition in 1977 and almost stopped. However, February 4, 1977 saw the first hearing of the proposed statue at Washington D.C. House Bill No. 574 successfully passed along with the Senate version of the bill Senate Bill No. 2431. Ultimately, Felix de Weldon received the commission by the Mother Joseph Foundation to create the statue. Many who viewed the statue thought it should have included hammer and nails instead of praying hands. The statue successfully reveals her desire and piousness to serve those in need. Additionally, the State of Washington celebrates her birthday as an official state holiday. Governor Gary Locke signed SB 5734 into law on April 16, 1999. SB 5734 also established September 4 as Marcus Whitman Day.Website of the Sisters of Providence-Mother Joseph Province \\"Just Who was Mother Joseph?\\" She was also inducted into the National Cowgirl Hall of Fame.Mother Joseph Pariseau (1823-1902), 1981 Cowgirl Honoree - Washington National Cowgirl Museum, Accessed 2010-07-29. Legacy Mother Joseph was responsible for the completion of eleven hospitals, seven academies, five schools for Native American children, and two orphanages throughout an area that now encompasses Washington, northern Oregon, Idaho, and Montana. Today the Province of Mother Joseph, which covers the Sisters of Providence of that region, honors her faith and pioneering spirit. Providence Academy continued in operation until 1966, when, with enrollment and the number of teaching Sisters declining and the school in need of remodeling, the Sisters decided to close the Academy and to sell their property in Vancouver. The building lay vacant for several years before it was purchased in 1969 by Robert Hidden, grandson of Lowell Hidden, founder of Hidden Brick Company, which had supplied the bricks for its construction. The facility operates as offices, shops, restaurant, a Montessori school and a wedding chapel. The building is on the National Register of Historic Places. The Hidden Family sold the property to the Vancouver National Historic Reserve Trust in January 2015. The Trust will continue its current use while restoring the site. In 2018, the Historic Trust announced plans to develop a low-modernist mixed-use development on the Providence Academy site, next to the historical building. This plan has been met with controversy.

Motivation The pupil strike was motivated by the demands of the state on schools to fill up the demanded 1040 clock hours they have to legally teach each year. The state wanted schools to fill these up with extra hours in which pupils were to be in the class with a teacher without getting actual lessons. Pupils state this does not increase the quality of education. First Strike As an effect of these policies organizations like DWARS and LAKS called for a strike on Friday 23 November. This call was done via Instant Messaging. Pupils throughout the nation joined in the strike and started ignoring lessons that day starting from 11:00 AM. A second strike was called for on Monday 26 November and yet again many pupils participated. The strike on Friday was generally calm, several pupils were however arrested on various charges.

It is a position that is sometimes referred to as being equivalent to a \\"human bullbar\\" due to their primary job in adding weight to the front of the boat to 'punch' through waves. Additionally, IRB crew persons must maintain the balance of the boat to enable fast turns as well as facilitate the rescue part of the service, including lifting patients into the water as well as swimming with a rescue tube. Assessment For a lifesaver to obtain their IRB Crew persons award, they must first be a minimum of 15 years of age and hold a Bronze Medallion award. Training usually is conducted over a number of weeks and at least 20 hours of training must be obtained before the final assessment can be sat. Training involves both theory and practical work. The practical work involve learning how to move around the IRB when the driver steers, patient pick up then returning the patient safely back to shore, \\"punching\\" waves, signals and holding the IRB steady before and after the IRB has left the shore for the driver. Duties While in the water, the crew person's job is to help keep the IRB balanced by shifting their body-weight while the IRB is being turned. During large surf, the crew person must also move to the front of the IRB and \\"punch\\" the wave to help prevent the IRB from flipping, if it does flip they must help the driver and rollover the IRB. The crew person must also carry out patient pickup if somebody is in trouble and then look after the patient in the boat while the driver returns to shore.

Foxhole lies on the B3279 road between St Austell and Newquay and is contiguous with the neighbouring village of Carpalla, home to a china clay pit. The village is overshadowed by Watch Hill, with its four ancient tumuli, on the east side, and on the west side by St Stephen's Beacon. This was called King Pippin's Mount in ancient times, when Pippin is said to have been buried in a barrow within a fortified enclosure at the summit of the beacon. The whole structure was destroyed by miners seeking stone to build an engine house - remnants of which can still be seen today. The first recorded settlements at Foxhole date back to the Middle Ages, when the moors all around the village were worked for tin lodes cropping out at the surface. In Tudor times the tin works around Foxhole included Carpalla, Chygwyn, Goverscailt, Stennagwyn and the Fox Hole mine, from which the village takes its name. In 1748 William Cookworthy visited the district and noticed a white scar on the beacon which turned out to be an opencast tin mine. His investigations revealed the ground contained fine quality china stone and clay which he used to patent the manufacture of hard paste porcelain and so was responsible for the start of the whole china clay industry in this district. In 1775 the great potter Josiah Wedgwood visited Foxhole and took leases on china clay-bearing land. Cookworthy's clay pit leases were bought in 1782 by the New Hall Company of Shelton, Staffordshire, makers of the famous New Hall china. When Josiah Wedgwood died in 1795, his three pits were taken over by his son Josiah Wedgwood II. The Carloggas pit, one of these three, was then bought by yet another famous potter, Josiah Spode, whose father had invented bone china. The post office is built with fine granite stone and is one of the oldest properties in the village. Both the chapel and post office have 'bench marks' (shown as a vertical arrow) establishing the height of land above sea level. The Union Hall was little more than a wooden shed in 1920, but was replaced by a building housing the Transport and General Workers Union in 1933. Later it was used as a village hall for concerts, dances and whist drives. It is now a doctors' surgery.The Cornwall Village Book.

In a racing career which lasted from the spring of 1948 until August 1949, he ran nine times and won six races. Nimbus ran successfully as a two-year-old in 1948, winning the July Stakes, but reached his peak the following year. He won close finishes in both the 2000 Guineas and The Derby but was unable to attempt the Triple Crown after his career was ended by injury. He had modest success as a breeding stallion. Background Nimbus was a bay horse with a white star and snip and white socks on his hind feet. He was bred by William Hill who would go on to win the St. Leger Stakes in 1959 with Cantelo. He was sired by Nearco, one of the most important sires of the 20th century. His dam, Kong, was sprinter whose victories included the Wokingham Stakes at Royal Ascot. In addition to Nimbus, Kong also produced Nimbus's three-quarter brother Grey Sovereign (sired by Nearco's son Nasrullah) who won the Richmond Stakes and became a successful breeding stallion. As a yearling, Nimbus was sent to the sales where he was bought for 5000 guineas by the trainer George Colling, acting on behalf of Henry Glenister. The colt was trained by Colling at his Hurworth House stable in Newmarket, Suffolk and raced in the colours of Glenister's wife, Marion. Racing career 1948: two-year-old season As a two-year- old in 1948, Nimbus ran five times and won twice. At Royal Ascot he finished second to Royal Forest in the Coventry Stakes and then won the July Stakes at Newmarket. In the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster in September he finished second by six lengths to Abernant. In the Free Handicap, a rating of the season's best two-year-olds he was given a weight of 123 pounds, ten pounds behind Abernant. 1949: three-year-old season Nimbus made good physical progress over the winter and began his three-year-old season by winning the Classic Trial Stakes at Thirsk. He was then sent to Newmarket for the 2000 Guineas, in which he was ridden by the veteran Charlie Elliott, and started at odds of 10/1, with Abernant starting odds-on favourite. Aberant built up a clear lead, but Nimbus made rapid progress in the closing stages and caught the favourite on the line to win by a short-head in the closest finish in the race's history. At Epsom Downs Racecourse a month later, Nimbus started at odds of 7/1 for the Derby in field of thirty-two runners, with Royal Forest, ridden by Gordon Richards being made 9/2 favourite. Heavy rain made the ground very soft, but did not deter a crowd of 500,000 which included Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth, Princess Elizabeth and Winston Churchill. With Colling suffering from poor health, Nimbus was saddled by Jack Jarvis. Despite doubts about the colt's stamina, Elliott sent Nimbus to the front almost from the start. Throughout the last half mile he was strongly challenged and briefly headed by Swallow Tail as the two colts went clear of the field. In the closing stages he was also challenged by the fast-finishing French-trained colt Amour Drake, who moved up along the rails as Nimbus and Swallow Tail drifted towards the centre of the course. In a three-way photo-finish, Nimbus prevailed by a head from Amour Drake with Swallow Tail a head away in third. In August, Nimbus walked over in a race at Haydock Park Racecourse. Soon afterwards he sustained an injury which ended his racing career. Stud career Retired to stud duty for the 1950 season, the offspring of Nimbus met with limited racing success.

La Grange became the county seat of Stanislaus County in 1856. Aside from its French population, the community included a significant Chinatown in its early years. At its height, the community had thousands of residents, but it was a largely lawless town. It was in decline by the time that Knights Ferry became the county seat, as the gold mines were in decline. By 1880, mining had ceased. The La Grange area also included many gold dredgers that operated until the early 1950s.\\"Gold Fields to Grazing Fields\\", by Franklin Beards, 1988 On June 3, 1869, John Muir departed Legrange (French Bar) with a sheep herder and a flock of sheep and headed for the headwaters of the Merced and Tuolumne rivers. Muir writes famously of this in his book “My First Summer in the Sierra”. In chapter one, Muir describes leaving French bar and moving with the flock into the hills near coulterville. He writes, “This morning provisions, camp- kettles, blankets, plant-press, etc., were packed on two horses, the flock headed for the tawny foothills, and away we sauntered in a cloud of dust: Mr. Delaney, bony and tall, with sharply hacked profile like Don Quixote, leading the pack-horses, Billy, the proud shepherd, a Chinaman and a Digger Indian to assist in driving for the first few days in the brushy foothills, and myself with notebook tied to my belt. The home ranch from which we set out is on the south side of the Tuolumne River near French Bar, where the foothills of metamorphic gold-bearing slates dip below the stratified deposits of the Central Valley”. In Many ways, this experience moves him so much, that he writes eloquently of the Yosemite area. His books are read by Americans including President Theodore Roosevelt. Muir becomes the face of a new conservation movement to save the Yosemite and creation of Yosemite National Park. “My First Summer In The Sierra”, by John Muir - HOUGHTON MIFFLIN COMPANY 1917 Historic district La Grange is now a registered California Historical Landmark historic district.

Aerial plant organs are protected by a cuticle composed of an insoluble polymeric structural compound, cutin, which is a polyester composed of hydroxy and hydroxyepoxy fatty acids. Plant pathogenic fungi produce extracellular degradative enzymes that play an important role in pathogenesis. They include cutinase, which hydrolyses cutin, facilitating fungus penetration through the cuticle. Inhibition of the enzyme can prevent fungal infection through intact cuticles. Cutin monomers released from the cuticle by small amounts of cutinase on fungal spore surfaces can greatly increase the amount of cutinase secreted by the spore, the mechanism for which is as yet unknown. Cutinase is a serine esterase containing the classical Ser, His, Asp triad of serine hydrolases.

Most of Colorado's vineyards are located on the western slope of the Rocky Mountains, though an increasing number of wineries are located along the Front Range. Geography and climate Colorado's grape growing regions contain some of the highest elevation vineyards in the world, with most viticulture in the state practiced between and feet above sea level. The mountain climate ensures warm summer days and cool nights. Colorado is home to two designated American Viticultural Areas of the Grand Valley AVA and the West Elks AVA, where most of the vineyards in the state are located. Approximately 100 commercial wineries operate in Colorado and about are planted to grapevines. Other wine regions include: the Four Corners area near Cortez, near Canyons of the Ancients National Monument, and Durango; Pikes Peak/Arkansas River Valley near Salida, Canon City, and Manitou Springs; and the Front Range between Fort Collins and Castle Rock, with many wineries located in the Denver metropolitan area. History Grapevines were first brought to Colorado in the 19th century by miners in southern Colorado. The first agricultural record of vineyards was when Governor George A. Crawford, founder of Grand Junction planted 60 acres of grapes and other fruit near Palisade. Homegrown wine was once a part of life in Colorado as it was throughout America. Like in other areas Prohibition in the United States virtually wiped out the Colorado wine industry in the early twentieth century only to have it resurrected again in the 1960s. In 1968, Gerald Ivancie opened Ivancie Winery in Denver using grapes from California, but was instrumental in developing experimental plantings of premium wine grapes in and around the Grand Valley.http://www.coloradowine.com Ivancie's winemaker was Warren Winiarski, who was the first winemaker at Robert Mondavi Winery and rose to fame when he won the Judgement of Paris (wine) tasting in 1976 for his Stag's Leap Wine Cellars S.L.V Cabernet Sauvignon.http://www.denverpost.com/food/ci_25883924/arrival-our- wineshttp://www.coloradowinepress.com/2014/05/the-first-flying-winemaker.html In 1977 Colorado's Limited Farm Winery Act was passed; a decade later Colorado was one of the first states to respond to California's offer to establish free trade among wineries and consumers through the Reciprocal Shipping Law, helping the re-emerging Colorado grape growing and winemaking industry. In 1990, with five operating wineries, the Colorado General Assembly created the Colorado Wine Industry Development Board. In 1991, the Grand Valley area near Palisade, Colorado, was recognized by the federal government as an American Viticultural Area (AVA). In 2001, the West Elks AVA was added as the second AVA. In 2010, there were approximately 115 commercial wineries in Colorado. In 2019, there are approximately 165 wineries - including 21 hard cider producers, 13 mead producers and 1 sake producer. Every year, the Colorado Wine Industry Development Board hosts the Governor's Cup Competition; which is the only competition exclusively for Colorado wineries. The top wines from the competition comprise the Governor's Cup Collection which is used to showcase the industry to the public and the wine industry. Grapes The most popular grapes grown in Colorado are varieties in the species of European grape Vitis vinifera. The most popular red varieties are Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, and Cabernet Franc. The most popular white varieties are Chardonnay, Riesling, and Viognier. Recognition Several Colorado wineries have been awarded scores of 90 points or above by Wine Enthusiast Magazine and The Wine Advocate. In 2017, Colorado Mountain Winefest was voted the best wine festival in the U.S. by USA Today 10Best.http://www.10best.com/awards/travel/best-wine- festival-2017/ Also in 2017, Kyle Schlachter (Outreach Coordinator for the CO Wine Industry Development Board) was named one of Wine Enthusiast Magazine's 40 Under 40 Tastemakers because his efforts reflect the diversity and uniqueness of wine in the U.S.https://www.winemag.com/content/40-under-40-2017-kyle-schlachter/ In 2018, Wine Enthusiast Magazine named Colorado's Grand Valley AVA one of the Top Ten wine travel destinations in the world.https://www.winemag.com/top-10-wine- travel-getaways-2018/grand-valley-colorado-usa/ See also * American wine * Grand Valley AVA * West Elks AVA References External links * Colorado Wine Industry Development Board * Wine regions of the United States by state ","title":"Colorado wine"},{"id":"14455337","text":"In enzymology, a D-arabinonolactonase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :D-arabinono-1,4-lactone + H2O \\\\rightleftharpoons D-arabinonate Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-arabinono-1,4-lactone and H2O, whereas its product is D-arabinonate.

After he sees another man leaving her flat, he assumes it's her lover and the two quarrel, ending in him accidentally striking her dead. He leaves unnoticed, then anonymously tips off the police so that the man he saw, a 51-year-old insurance broker called Paul Menzies, will be arrested.

The protagonist is eventually sacked from his job, and puts his family life on hold, attending the courthouse hearings everyday. His guilt grows ever larger, and he is consumed by the fear that Menzies will be found innocent and the police will identify him as the real murderer. Despite his fears of being caught, the protagonist returns to the courthouse every day, waiting for the court of law to find Menzies guilty.

Their work includes restoring the Pantheon clock,\\"Undercover restorers fix Paris landmark's clock\\", The Guardian, 26 Nov 2007 building a cinema – complete with a bar and a restaurant – in a section of the Paris Catacombs underneath the Trocadéro, restoring medieval crypts, and staging plays and readings in monuments after dark. The group's membership is largely secret, but its spokespeople include Lazar Kunstmann. History With its start in September 1981, the founders of the group stole plans of the many underground passageways and tunnels for which Paris is famous. Using this information as a base, the group of anonymous artists and citizens have since restored much of Paris's underground infrastructure, including the Pantheon clock which chimed for the first time in many years after its repair. The group is also responsible for over a dozen other projects, including those which the French government have not chosen to do or for which they lack funds. Organisation The organization is divided into teams: an all-female team (the Mouse House) specializing in infiltration, a team running an internal messaging system and coded radio network, a team providing a database, a team organizing underground shows, a team doing photography, and a team (Untergunther) doing restoration. Untergunther's membership includes architects and historians. In October 2007, they received attention for a project, assisted by professional clockmaker Jean-Baptiste Viot, to clandestinely restore the famous clock in the Panthéon. Never caught, upon completion they announced their work at a meeting with the administrator of the Panthéon, who called the police. La Mexicaine De Perforation (The Mexican Consolidated Drilling Authority) is another subdivision of the UX which provides clandestine artistic events. In September 2004, French police discovered an underground movie theatre run by La Mexicaine De Perforation. The makeshift theatre contained a movie screen, a well stocked bar, and a kitchen. Telephones and electricity were brought in from an unknown location. Movie titles ranging from 1950s classics to modern thrillers were also discovered. When the police returned for a formal investigation, all the equipment had disappeared — all that was left was a note on the floor reading, \\"Ne cherchez pas\\" (\\"Do not search\\"). Official reaction Parisian authorities oppose the group's actions and have started a police unit to track the group through the sewers and catacombs of Paris in an attempt to apprehend and charge its members. Charges were brought against the four Untergunther restorers of the Pantheon clock, but at trial, after 20 minutes' deliberation, the judge ruled in their favor. One of the government's prosecutors referred to the charges as \\"stupid\\".

The tale comes from the Fox and Sac tribes in what is now central Iowa. The Meskwaki (Fox) and Asikiwaki (Sauk/Sac) Indians were related to each other and spoke the same language, but were politically independent. However, the Fox tribe was nearly destroyed in a war with the French and the surviving Fox Indians fled to the Sauk villages for protection. The two tribes merged into a single tribe called the Sac and Fox. Most Sac and Fox people still live together today. The version below was collected by John Tobin in his book With No Intention.Laurance Press Company Cedar Rapids 1979  Legend  Unga-Chuk's story takes place on Cedar River in Iowa. Unga-Chuk lived in a clearing by the banks of the river. The exact setting is referred to as the meeting of The Three Waters. He was the grandson of Chief Poweshiek and the son of Magor. He was considered the pride of the village. Life was good until Magor, his father, did not return from a hunt. Unga-Chuk then went to live with his grandfather and learned to become a great leader in his village. The village lived very peaceful and happy lives with Unga-Chuk marrying his sweetheart Lees-Wa. Later Unga-Chuk one day saw visions that upset him. The first being three trees silhouetted like people on the horizon. The two trees were to one side of a tree that stood alone. Then Unga-Chuk saw three suns setting (possibly explained today as sundogs). The visions were strange and troubling to the tribe. However, since good fortune followed, the signs were soon forgotten. A few years later, an evil man in the village named Napatog started to hate Unga-Chuk, becoming jealous of his skills and the fact that he would be the next chief of the village. Napatog planned to murder Unga-Chuk, then he would become the next chief. Napatog waited until Unga-Chuk took a morning walk in the foggy valley to carry out his plan of murder. He shot and killed Unga-Chuk with an arrow. The day turned bright and sunny except where the body of Unga-Chuk lay. The villagers soon began to worry about this mystery fog. The village soon discovered what had happened and rose up to drive Napatog away. The village was rewarded with a beautiful sunset that let them know that Unga-Chuk made it safely to his final resting place. Unga-Chuk's death brought peace to the village and he removed all evils from the tribes. The story finishes with a red rose growing in Nesswe Neppe as proof that the blood spilled by Unga-Chuk nourished and made the ground of this land fertile and good. It is said that on the anniversary of Unga-Chuk's death, when the fog is lifting from the valley, he can be heard still calling for his beloved Lees-Wa.

Qualifying as the #2 seed, Monacelli defeated Chris Barnes in the semifinal, then went on to defeat England's Dominic Barrett in the final. Ending an 11-year title drought on the standard PBA Tour, the 54-year old Monacelli became the third-oldest player to win a PBA Tour title, behind John Handegard (age 57) and Buzz Fazio (winner of two titles at age 56). With Norm Duke winning a 2019 standard PBA Tour title a month shy of his 55th birthday, Monacelli is now fourth on this list. Monacelli's 20 total titles place him tied for 13th on the all-time list with Dick Ritger, Tommy Jones, and Wayne Webb. He has won over $2.5 million (U.S.) on the PBA Tour (through 2016), making him one of only seven PBA bowlers in history to surpass $2 million in career earnings. He was ranked #21 on the PBA's 2008 list of \\"50 Greatest Players of the Last 50 Years,\\" and has rolled 58 perfect 300 games in PBA Tour events. The PBA recognized Monacelli in 1997 by inducting him into the PBA Hall of Fame, making him the first international player so honored. In a 1999 edition of El Nacional, a Venezuelan newspaper, Monacelli was ranked as the fourth best Venezuelan athlete of the 20th Century. He was inducted into the USBC Hall of Fame in 2012.Manzione, Gianmarc. \\"Husted, Monacelli, Baker, Davidson elected to USBC Hall of Fame.\\" Article at www.bowl.com on Jan. 2, 2012. PBA50 Tour While continuing to bowl in selected events on the PBA Tour, Monacelli also joined the PBA Senior Tour (now PBA50 Tour) in 2012 and became the first international player to win the Senior U.S. Open by defeating all-time PBA titles leader Walter Ray Williams, Jr. in the final match. Monacelli was selected as the 2012 PBA Senior Rookie of the Year, becoming the first international player to earn the award. He has gone on to win a total of nine PBA50 Tour titles through the 2019 season, including a repeat win in the 2013 Senior U.S. Open and another major win at the 2015 USBC Senior Masters.

There are three major regions of vineyards and wineries in Arizona: * Verde Valley – north of Phoenix on SR-260 and SR-89A near Sedona * Sonoita – south of Tucson on SR-83 * Willcox – east of Tucson on the I-10 Most vineyards in Arizona are located in the southeastern portion of the state south and east of Tucson, which is also the location of Arizona's two designated AVA's (American Viticultural Area), the Sonoita AVA (established in 1985) and the Willcox AVA (established in 2016). Arizona has enjoyed recent success with wine made from the grape varieties native to Italy and the Rhône valley of southern France. It is not clear when viticulture and winemaking first began in Arizona. In 1703, the famous Jesuit missionary and explorer Eusebio Francisco Kino reported growing grapes and making wine for Mass at his mission of Dolores in nearby Sonora. However historic records suggest there was very little winemaking in Arizona itself during the Spanish period since many of the missions and settlements were not in good winegrowing locations. During the territorial period, farmers in the Salt River Valley around Phoenix began making wine in the mid-1870s and a small winemaking industry eventually emerged in nearby Mesa during the 1880s. In northern Arizona, Henry Schuerman established a farm and orchard along Oak Creek in the Verde Valley and later planted a large vineyard to make wine for the nearby mining camp of Jerome. In the fall of 1914, Arizonans voted to go dry and banned the sale and consumption of alcohol, effectively ending Arizona's budding wine industry. Starting in the mid-1970s, Dr. Gordon Dutt, a soil scientist at the University of Arizona, conducted experiments that demonstrated that parts of Arizona could produce quality wine grapes. Dutt went on to found Vina Sonoita Vineyards – the first modern commercial wine vineyard in Arizona. In 1980, Navy veteran Robert Webb opened the R. W. Webb Winery in Tucson and later established a vineyard south of Willcox. Other pioneering Arizona winemakers during the 1980s and 1990s included William Staltari, Tino Ocheltree, Al Buhl, and Kent Callaghan. There now are over 110 wineries, vineyards and cellars throughout Arizona, including in the cities of Phoenix and Tucson. The wineries, vineyards and cellars are supported by two state-wide organizations: the Arizona Wine Growers Association, a non-profit NGO representing, educating and promoting the state's wine industry, and by the Arizona Vignerons Alliance(AZVA), a non-profit organization collecting data on all Arizona wine- growing regions, ensuring authenticity of Arizona wine and working to promote Arizona wine as recognized, respected and sought-after in Arizona, the U.S., and globally. AWGA supports the wine industry through promotional events, state awards to the best wines in Arizona and industry lobbying efforts at the local, state and national level. AZVA establishes parameters for growing grapes and producing wines in Arizona; verifies, certifies and promotes 100% Arizona wine; collects, evaluates and shares Arizona viniculture data; holds the annual AZVA Symposium and Wine tasting and participates in existing regional and international events to raise national and global awareness of Arizona wine; and promotes truth in labeling by giving the consumer and wine professional accurate information based on a data-driven and fact-based approach to wine labeling. The Southwest Wine Center, established in 2009, is part of Yavapai College's Verde Valley Campus. SWC provides education and training for the AZ wine industry through Yavapai College's Viticulture and Enology Program. Students at YC can earn an AA in Viticulture and Enology or a certificate in Viticulture or Enology.

He was a brother of Witold Eugeniusz and pupil of Józef Pankiewicz. Co-founder of the Cercle des Artistes Polonais in Paris. Zawadowski was influenced mainly by post-impressionism. Biography Jan- Waclaw Zawadowksi, also known as ZAWADO, was born on 14 April 1891 in Volhynie (Russian Poland), he is very close of the post-impressionism style. When he was 13, the young Waclaw Zawadowski discovered French paintings. In 1910 he began to study at the Fine Art School of Cracovie in professor Józef Pankiewicz's studio. In 1912 Józef encouraged Zawadowski to go to Paris. After a brief stay in « La Ruche » (an artist's residence) he moved in Montmartre. Then, he became one of the actors of the artistic community of Montparnasse. He signs his first and last contract of exclusivity with a German art dealer : Paul Cassirer, who organized many expositions in Germany. During the war, Zawado go to Spain for four years, mostly in Madrid where he meets his friends, also Polish painters and Arthur Rubinstein. In 1919, when the war is over, he can then go back to Paris. In 1920, Modigliani just died and Zawado move in his studio. During the summer, mostly with other artists, Zawado go to their favorite destinations : Saint-Cirq Lapopie, in Collioure with Foujita, in Sanary or in Le Blanc with Soutine, and also in Bretagne where he paint landscapes. Very tied with Leopold Zborowski, one of the greatest modern art dealer (for example he worked with Modigliani) Zawado gave him to sale his paintings. It's Zborowski who ask him to signed his paintings « Zawado » instead of « Zawadowski ». In 1928, he enter into the « Circle of Polish artists in Paris ». Between 1920 and 1930 he took part at the artistic life of the first School of Paris. He speaks to many writers, musicians and of course painters. He exhibited in Poland, in Paris (Benezit's Gallery) and in London. In 1930 Zawado starts his stays in Aix-en-Provence. In 1938 he take the direction of the Polish Institut of Fine Arts in Paris. In 1945 he stay definitively in Aix but still keep a studio in Paris. Being in the south without other painter's influences made him grow his very own style. His paintings now reflect the very particular light of the south of France. During the 60s his first solo exhibitions starts in Aix, specially in Gallery Spinazzola. From now on Zawado mostly exhibited in the south of France. However a great restrospective took place in Cracovie in 1975, followed by a personal show in 1976 in New-York. It's therefore a whole world made of writers, musicians and painters who starts to visit him. On 15 November 1982 Zawado died at his property in Provence.

He made his first team debut on 11 April 1992 in a 3–1 win at MSV Duisburg and became a regular player during the following season. After making 110 appearances for 1. FC Köln over six seasons, he departed for France in July 1997, joining Rennes. He was a mainstay of their starting XI during his first Ligue 1 campaign, but the arrival of Paul Le Guen as manager saw his appearances during the 1998–99 season become more limited. He returned to Germany to sign for VfL Wolfsburg and begin a six-year association with the club. He played 159 league games for the club during this period, and also featured in several UEFA Cup campaigns. During this time he switched to playing more predominantly as a defender than as midfielder. In August 2005, Weiser returned to his former club 1. FC Köln, signing a two-year deal. He only made a handful of appearances for the club though during their campaign in the league, DFB Cup and Intertoto Cup. Managerial career After retiring from playing he became a coach at under 16 level for 1. FC Köln in 2009, and later became assistant coach of the first team for the 2011–12 season. In October 2012, he moved to the role of head coach at English club Wolverhampton Wanderers, where he reunited with Ståle Solbakken who he had previously been assistant to at 1. FC Köln.

Biography He was born in London, came to America when very young, and for several years traveled through the country writing plays and acting them without attaining much reputation. In 1852 he assumed the management of a theatre in St. Louis, Missouri, where he was also later principal owner and an editor of the Reveille, a daily newspaper. At the same time he became widely known for his humorous sketches signed \\"Straws\\" in the New Orleans Picayune. On, November 6, 1837, Field married actress Eliza Riddle, with whom he had co- starred in several performances.

Field was a unique figure in the history of American journalism. She began writing when still in her teens, and her letters to the Springfield Republican of Massachusetts, and other papers, over the signature of \\"Straws, Jr.,\\" were well received. She wrote from Washington, D.C., New York City, and Europe. She was one of the few successful paragraphists, and her criticisms of art, music, and the drama, were just. She was both editor and publisher of her paper, Washington.  Early years and education  Mary Katherine Keemle Field, known to her friends and family as Kate, was born October 1, 1838, in St. Louis, Missouri, the daughter of actors Joseph M. Field and Eliza Riddle.Scharnhorst, Gary. Kate Field: The Many Lives of a Nineteenth-Century American Journalist. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2008: 3. In 1839, the family moved to New Orleans, where Field's father worked for the New Orleans Picayune and a local theater company. The family returned to St. Louis by 1852, where her father opened a theater company, before moving to Mobile, Alabama.Scharnhorst, Kate Field, pp. 9-10. Field was a precocious child who showed an early interest in literature. She published her first poem, \\"A Child's Muse\\", at nine years old in her father's newspaper in St. Louis.Scharnhorst, Kate Field, pg. 10. In the fall of 1855, she was sent to live with wealthy relatives in Cordaville, Massachusetts, while she attended Lasell Female Seminary (now Lasell College).Scharnhorst, Kate Field, pg. 12. At age 16, she was sent to Europe to travel as a form of education. She spent time in Florence, Italy studying voice, and there she also began writing for American newspapers. A story circulated that she was abducted while in Sicily by brigands who demanded a substantial ransom. After six weeks, her family paid the requested amount, but not before the leader of the gang had fallen in love with her and proposed. Though she turned down the engagement, her positive influence allegedly inspired him to move to a monastery.Steward, Deborah. \\"Field, Mary Katherine Keemle (1838–1896)\\" from Dictionary of Missouri Biography (editors: Laurence O. Christensen, et al). Columbia: University of Missouri Press, 1999: 294. Career In 1871, Field embarked on a lecture tour throughout New England and upstate New York. In Buffalo, New York, she met Mark Twain, a fellow lecturer and journalist, who spoke and wrote negatively about her.Scharnhorst, Kate Field, pg. 82. She continued lecturing into the Midwestern states, mostly stopping in small towns and rural areas. Six months later, she complained, \\"I never wish to repeat my lecture experiences in America. I loathe the life and the majority of the country audiences. I did it for money.\\"Scharnhorst, Kate Field, pg. 83. In 1874, Field appeared as Peg Woffington at Booth's Theatre, New York City. She afterward abandoned the regular comedy for dance, song, and recitation, but achieved no striking success. In 1882-83 she headed a Coöperative Dress Association in New York, which achieved a conspicuous failure. In 1889 she established Kate Field's Washington, a weekly journal published in Washington, D.C. After 1868, she published numerous volumes of miscellaneous contents, no longer noteworthy though, during her career, her comments were noted internationally. Field never married. In October 1860, while visiting his mother's home in Florence, she met the celebrated British novelist Anthony Trollope. She became one of his closest friends and was the subject of Trollope's high esteem, as noted in his \\"Autobiography\\": \\"There is an American woman, of whom not to speak in a work purporting to [be] a memoir of my own life would be to omit all allusion to one of the chief pleasures which has graced my later years.\\" Trollope scholars have speculated on the nature of their warm friendship. Twenty-four of his letters to Field survive and are now housed at the Boston Public Library; hers to Trollope do not. Field died of pneumonia in 1896 in Honolulu. She was buried with her parents at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Her father was Illinois State Senator Lorenzo D. Whiting. She served as literary editor of the Boston Evening Traveller (1880–1890), editor-in-chief of the Boston Budget (1890–93), and afterward, spent much of her time in Europe. Whiting was the author of The World Beautiful, From Dreamland Sent, a book of poems, A Study of the Life and Poetry of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, A Record of Kate Field, The World Beautiful in Books, Boston Days, Florence of Landor, The Outlook Beautiful, Italy, the Magic Land, Paris the Beautiful, and others. Early years and education Emily Lilian Whiting was born in Niagara Falls, New York (or Olcott, New York), on October 3, 1847, though she often claimed her date of birth as October 3, 1859. Her parents were Hon. Lorenzo Dowe and Lucretia Clement Whiting. Her ancestry included Rev. William Whiting, the first Unitarian minister of Concord, Massachusetts, in the early part of the 17th century. Her paternal grandmother was born Mather, and was a direct descendant of Cotton Mather. On her mother's side, her ancestry was also from New England, largely of the Episcopal clergy. While Whiting was an infant, the parents removed to Illinois. For some time, the parents served as principals of the public schools in Tiskilwa, Illinois, a village near their farm. Subsequently, the father became the editor of the Bureau County Republican, published in Princeton, Illinois. In that work, he was assisted by his wife. Later, he was elected to the Illinois General Assembly as representative from his district, and, after some years in the lower house, was elected State senator, in which capacity he served for 18 consecutive years. He was one of the framers of the constitution of Illinois. Little was left to the children after the death of Senator Whiting, in 1889. The mother died in 1875. Whiting, the only daughter, was educated largely under private tuition and by her parents. She attended the Mount Carroll Seminary (later known as Shimer College) in Illinois. Books and periodicals abounded in the family home with the best literature of the world available to her. She inherited from her mother much of the temperament of the mystic and the visionary, and her bent was always towards books and the world of thought. Career Whiting went to St. Louis, Missouri, in 1876, to pursue a career in journalist, remaining there for three years. In the spring of 1879, through the acceptance of two papers on Margaret Fuller, Murat Halstead gave Whiting a place on his paper, the Cincinnati Commercial. After a year in Cincinnati, she went, in the summer of 1880, to Boston, Massachusetts, where she soon began to work for the Boston Evening Traveller as an art writer. To her writing on the art exhibitions and studio work in Boston and New York City, she added various miscellaneous contributions. In 1885, she was made the literary editor of the Traveller. In 1890, she resigned her place on the Traveller, and, three days after, she became the editor-in-chief of the Boston Budget. In that paper, she did the editorial writing, the literary reviews and a \\"Beau Monde\\" column. Cover of The Life Radiant by Lilian Whiting Whiting passed part of 1896 to 1900 in Europe, principally in Paris, Rome, Florence, and London, and again part of 1903, 1905, 1906–7. She was the author of The World Beautiful, 3 volumes., 1st, 2d and 3d series; From Dreamland Sent (poems); After Her Death; The Story of a Summer; A Study of the Life and Poetry of Elizabeth Barrett Browning; Kate Field—a Record; The Spiritual Significance, 1900; The World Beautiful in Books, 1901; Boston Days, 1902; The Life Radiant, 1903; The Florence of Landor, 1900; The Outlook Beautiful, 1905; The Joy that no Man taketh from You, 1905; The Land of Enchantment, 1906; From Dream to Vision of Life, 1906; Italy, the Magic Land, 1907.

During 1853, Nerval had suffered three nervous breakdowns and spent five months in an asylum. He saw Les Filles du feu as an opportunity to show the public, his friends and his father that he was sane,Bony, Jacques. \\"Introduction\\", Les Filles du feu by Gérard de Nerval. Paris: GF Flammarion, 1994. though except for the introduction all of the pieces in Les Filles du feu had been published previously: \\"Angélique\\" in Les Faux Saulniers (1850), \\"Sylvie\\" in La Revue des Deux Mondes (1853), and \\"Émilie\\", \\"Jemmy\\", \\"Isis\\" and \\"Octavie\\" in diverse reviews. The precise meaning of the title, which Nerval chose just before publication, is uncertain. Scholars have identified its source as the ceremonies of Irish vestal virgins described in Michelet's Histoire de France (1833) or a poem in a novel by Alexandre Dumas, La Tulipe noire (1850). Introduction Les Filles du feu is dedicated to Alexandre Dumas, Nerval's friend and collaborator on works for the theater. The previous December, Dumas had published an essay attributing Nerval's mental crises to an excess of creative imagination, an exaggerated emotional identification with the historic figures he wrote about. In his introduction to the volume, Nerval elaborates on Dumas' analysis, describing how their old friend Charles Nodier once claimed he had been guillotined during the French Revolution. He discusses how writers and actors identify with their subjects. He also hints at a future volume describing his crises. Angélique Written in the form of twelve letters addressed to a periodical, Angélique recounts the author's travels through France and Germany in search of an antique book and his discovery of the diary of an historic Fille du Feu. The longest story in the collection, it is more in the style of Les Illuminés. Sylvie (Souvenirs du Valois) Much admired by Marcel Proust for its poetic vision, Sylvie is a semi-autobiographical tale of a man who is haunted by the memory of three women in his life, all of whom seem to blend together. The story opens with the narrator at the theatre, where he is enamored by an actress named Aurélie. He is suddenly reminded of a memory from childhood, and he experiences a flashback. First, he remembers a festival where he danced with a local girl named Sylvie but was entranced by Adrienne, a young noble (whose resemblance to Aurélie is what brings on the flashback). Adrienne ultimately becomes a nun. As Adrienne is unobtainable, he returns to Sylvie several years later and spends many days with her. As they pass by a monastery, the narrator mentions Adrienne, much to Sylvie's dismay. He returns to Paris. The narrator returns, and Sylvie and he spend a day socializing at an elderly relative's home. However, nothing results from this, and the narrator leaves again. Finally, Sylvie marries someone else, and the narrator pursues Aurélie, the actress, more aggressively. They become friendly, and the narrator asks her if she ever spent time in a convent, associating her with Adrienne. Ultimately, Aurélie ends her relationship with the narrator, and the narrator returns one final time to Sylvie, now a mother. When he asks about Adrienne, Sylvie reveals that she has been dead many years. Chansons et Legendes du Valois A short essay that is appended to Sylvie wherever it is published, it does not constitute a separate section of Les Filles du Feu in itself. The essay describes some folk songs of the province of Valois where Nerval had grown up and where Sylvie is set, and it includes a short folk tale, La Reine des Poissons (The Queen of the Fishes). Jemmy A translation, reconstruction and adaptation of a story by Charles Sealsfield, pseudonym of Austrian author Karl Postl (1793–1864), this tale of Jemmy O'Dogherty's adventures among the native Americans. Described by Nerval as \\"Imité de l'Allemand\\", an \\"imitation\\" rather than a translation of the German original. Octavia The story begins in Paris. The narrator, wishing to escape the haunting memory of an \\"ill-starred love\\", decides to travel to Italy, stopping first in Marseille for a few days. Every day, when he goes swimming in the bay, he sees a mysterious English woman named Octavia. Blonde, pale, and slender, she is so at home in the water, she could be a mermaid. The narrator's suspicions increase when one day she catches a fish with her bare hands and shows it to him. The town has been hit by cholera, so the narrator decides to continue his journey by land in order to circumvent the quarantine. As he is waiting in Civitavecchia for the steamboat to arrive, he spots Octavia at the local theater. She is sick, the narrator learns, and her doctors had recommended she travel to Naples to regain her strength. The next day, when he boards the ship headed for Naples, he sees her biting into a lemon rind, and tells her it can't be good for her, considering her chest disease. Surprised, she asks him who told him that she was sick, to which he responds, enigmatically, \\"The Tiburtine sibyl.\\" He kisses her hand, and she tells him to meet her the next day at Portici. They disembark and go their separate ways. While she goes to a hotel with her father, the narrator wanders around the city of Naples, eventually attending a ballet where he encounters a marquis he had met in Paris. This aristocrat invites him to an evening party in a salon. Leaving the salon after a pleasant evening, the narrator gets lost in the streets of Naples. As he is wandering near the Villa Reale, he follows a peasant woman back to her home. The woman's home is so full of religious icons and trinkets, the narrator starts to wonder if she is a witch or a gypsy. She offers him some food and wine, then asks him, \\"Why so sad?\\" in Italian, before launching into a peculiar language that strikes him as \\"primeval,\\" like \\"Hebrew\\" or \\"Syriac.\\" While the narrator is still confused at her language, she pulls out an assortment of accessories which increase her power over him. Though still under this woman's spell, the narrator successfully tears himself away from her presence. He sets off for the Mount Posilipo. While he is at the top, his thoughts return to the \\"ill-starred love\\" he left behind in Paris. Feeling her to be painfully far away, he jumps to his death twice, but each time, miraculously, he survives. Having recovered his senses, he remembers his appointment with Octavia and goes on his way to Portici. She meets him under a vine arbor, and along with her father, they visit Pompeii and the temple of Isis. When he tells her about the ceremonies that used to take place there, they decide to reenact them. Octavie expresses the wish to play the role of Isis, and the narrator that of Osiris. As they return to Naples, the narrator doesn't speak of his love for her. She chastises him for being cool and distant, but he says he doesn't feel worthy of her, telling her that he is still haunted by the other woman in Paris. Years later, the author learns that Octavie has married a young painter, who, shortly after their marriage, became paralyzed and bedridden. Even though she dedicates herself to caring for her husband, he is suspicious of her every move. The narrator returns to Marseille, haunted by the knowledge of Octavia's suffering. Isis (Souvenirs de Pompei) This travel narrative describes the influence of Egypt's religion on the Roman Empire. Nerval describes a visit he made to Pompeii. The prevailing light in the essay is moonlight, and the Fille du Feu is the goddess Isis. The essay concludes with an examination of some themes common to Christianity and other ancient religions. Corilla A short play relating the adventures of two suitors who are after the favors of a theatrical actress. One of them is fobbed off with a flower seller by the official that he pays. The play ends amicably and is a light comedy. The Filles du Feu are the actress and the flower seller. Émilie The actual citadel at Bitche where part of Émilie takes place This story is understood to have been largely the work of Auguste Maquet, a friend of Nerval and of Alexandre Dumas. Maquet left a note in manuscript claiming that he had written it following a plan devised by Nerval, though he himself disliked the ending. It had appeared in the journal Le Messageur in 1839 signed \\"G.\\" under the title \\"Le Fort de Bitche\\".Gérard de Nerval, Œuvres, notice de Henri Lemaitre, Classiques Garnier, 1986, p. 483. Émilie is the story of Desroches, a French lieutenant serving near Bitche in Lorraine near the German border sometime after 1815. While recuperating in Metz after being wounded, he befriends Emilie, a young woman from Haguenau in Alsace, and they soon decide to marry. The night before the civil ceremony, Desroches tells some fellow soldiers how he had \\"killed the first and only man I ever struck in hand-to-hand fighting\\" during a Prussian attempt on the fort of Bitche. At an inn the next day, Émilie's brother Wilhelm argues with Desroches' comrades about his own father's death at the hands of a French soldier in the same fort in Bitche. The next day, Wilhelm asks Desroches to give him a tour of the fort, and when they reach the spot where Wilhelm's father was killed, Wilhelm accuses Desroches and challenges him to a duel. Émilie sends a priest to intervene, but Desroches, knowing now that he killed her father, realizes that he and Émilie can never be happy together. He re-enlists and is killed on the front line. Émilie retires to a convent. The Chimeras The Chimeras (), a sequence of twelve sonnets, is appended to Les Filles du Feu. The poems are: \\"El Desdichado\\", \\"Myrtho\\", \\"Horus\\", \\"Antéros\\", \\"Delfica\\", \\"Artémis\\", \\"Le Christ aux Oliviers (I, II, II, IV, V)\\" and \\"Vers Dorés\\".

History  In its early years, the organization convened large “Spiritual Summits” in Calcutta (1968) and Geneva (1970) bringing together religious and spiritual leaders of diverse traditions to engage in dialogue, and address problems of intolerance, injustice and religious persecution. This network was supported by a distinguished group of “Founding Friends” including Eleanor Roosevelt, U Thant, Pope John XXIII, and the XIVth Dalai Lama, among others. These gatherings included Spiritual Summit V (1975), the first interfaith conference held at the United Nations and the first time a woman, Mother Teresa, represented the Catholic Church. The TOU has maintained a strong presence at the United Nations, attending global conferences, organizing workshops, lectures and major events including hosting the 50th Anniversary Celebration of the UN in New York (1995). As of 2008, the Temple of Understanding had become a leading organization in the interfaith movement.  Mission  The mission of The Temple of Understanding is to achieve peaceful coexistence among individuals, communities and societies through interfaith education. TOU programs emphasize experiential knowledge and dialogue as a means of connecting people across a spectrum of religious communities to create a more just and peaceful world. TOU goals are to: * foster appreciation of religious and cultural diversity * expand public discourse on religion and spirituality * promote constructive social change * further education for global citizenship The Temple of Understanding is a 501(c) (3) non-profit and Non- Governmental Organization with Consultative Status at the United Nation (ECOSOC).  The United Nations  In 1960, the TOU was encouraged by Eleanor Roosevelt to become an NGO and embrace Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, protecting freedom of thought, conscience and religion. In 2000 the Millennium Declaration, signed by 189 Member States, identified 8 Millennium Development Goals (MDG) to be achieved by the year 2015. The TOU's representative to the United Nations interweaves these goals throughout the organization's programs at the UN, in addition to sponsoring conferences and workshops on religious freedom.  The Juliet Hollister Awards  In 1996, in support and affirmation of individuals whose life work has advanced the interfaith ideal, the Temple of Understanding established the Juliet Hollister Awards Ceremony. Named in honor of the founder’s achievements, Hollister Awards are granted to individuals who are: 1. Religious figures who bring interfaith values into the place of worship where the faithful congregate; and 2. Secular figures who promote greater understanding of spiritual values in areas such as the arts, education, media, government, science, social justice, law and ecology. Past awardees include: Queen Noor, James Parks Morton, Sri Swami Satchidananda, Maestro Ravi Shankar, Henry Luce III, Mary Robinson, the XIVth Dalai Lama, Nelson Mandela, Dr. Wangari Maathai, Peter Max, Dr. Thomas Berry, Dr. Coleman Barks, Dr Suheil Bushrui, Cokie and Steven Roberts, Dr. Hans Kung, Pir Vilayat Inayat Khan, Suzan Johnson Cook, Thomas Keating, Majora Carter, Dr. Karan Singh, Chief Arvol Looking Horse, Venerable Dr. Yifa, and Daniel Pearl (accepted by Dr. Judea Pearl), Karen Armstrong, Prince El Hassan bin Talal, Bartholomew, Desmond M. Tutu, Rev. Dr. James A. Forbes, May Rihani, Rabbi Awraham Soetendorp, NYU Center for Spiritual Life Development Team (Chelsea Clinton, Imam Khalid Latif, and Rabbi Yehuda Sarna).  Practices  The Temple of Understanding does not itself host religious services. It is an organization that advocates the importance of respect for all faiths.  The Interfaith Dialogue, Education, and Action (IDEA) The Interfaith Dialogue, Education and Action Program (IDEA) is an education and leadership skills development program for 14 to 19-year-old students. The mission of IDEA is to empower and educate youth (ages 14 to 19) from different cultural backgrounds to build leadership and critical thinking skills, create strong bonds of friendship across ethnic, cultural and religious groups and engender an appreciation for and willingness to pursue lifelong learning opportunities. By expanding these skills in underserved youth, we can help students gain the confidence and important tools necessary for breaking the cycle of poverty.  The Interfaith Experience  In the fall of 2007, the TOU launched \\"The Interfaith Experience,\\" a program at the Rubin Museum of Art which presents contemporary artists, thinkers and leaders who provide insights on the role of faith in the creative and intellectual process. Presenters for the series have included actor Linus Roache, The Venerable Nicholas Vreeland, visionary artist Alex Grey, Revs. Alan Lokos and Susanna Weiss, Ezgi Sorman, Dr Kurt Johnson, Loch Kelly and the Rev.

Wythe was a distinguished attorney who attended the Philadelphia Convention in 1775 and signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776; in 1806, he died of arsenic poisoning. Before he died, Wythe accused his nephew of murder and changed his will to exclude him. Wythe's black housekeeper provided evidence that George Sweeney had tried to poison Wythe, her son and her, but by law was prohibited from testifying in a criminal case against a white man. Sweeney was tried and found not guilty. The case is used as an example of how racism in early American law resulted in an acquittal. Circumstances Although George Wythe was 80 years old, he was healthy and vigorous. Since his only child had died as an infant decades before, Wythe in 1803 or earlier wrote a will leaving a large amount to George Sweeney, his sister's grandson named after him. When Sweeney, a 17-year-old drinker and gambler, came to live with Wythe in 1805, he began stealing Wythe's books for sale and forging Wythe's name on personal bank account checks to help pay his debts. Wythe had also made settlements for former slaves Lydia Broadnax, whom he had freed in 1787, and her 16-year-old son Michael Brown, as well as Benjamin, an adult man whom he freed in 1797. Sweeney would share his inheritance with them. Since Sweeney feared that Wythe would discover the forgeries, and knew that he was a beneficiary of Wythe's estate, evidence suggests that he decided to murder his uncle and/or the other heirs. A shopkeeper later attested that he sold Sweeney arsenic, and Broadnax said she saw him put something in the coffeepot in the kitchen from which Wythe, Broadnax and Brown drank that Sunday morning, May 25. Brown and Wythe died slow and agonizing deaths over several days: Brown on June 1 and Wythe a week later on June 8, 1806. Broadnax survived. As Wythe lay on his death bed, Sweeney's forgeries were discovered. On June 1, the judge changed his will to disinherit his grandnephew. Trial On June 18, Sweeney was arrested and charged with murder. The trial began on September 2. the Convincing testimony pointing to Sweeney as the culprit was provided by Broadnax, who had been Wythe's cook for many years. She had witnessed Sweeney's suspicious behaviors around the coffee pot, which suggested that he had placed a substance in the coffee on May 25, while she was in the kitchen with him. Broadnax had drunk a small amount of the coffee and become ill. When Wythe and Brown also became ill from drinking the coffee, she testified that she suspected that Sweeney had put something in it. The two judges did not allow Broadnax's testimony into evidence nor that of the other black servants who had seen Sweeney's suspicious behaviors. They adhered to the law at that time, which did not allow blacks to testify against a white person in a criminal trial: \\"It was gleaned from negroes, which is not permitted by our laws to go against a white man.\\" Hearsay evidence was introduced by the whites who testified that Sweeney had bought arsenic. The jail warden testified that Sweeney had not been searched upon arrest, and that later a packet with arsenic was found in the jail yard, where it could have been thrown from a jail window. Another person testified that Wythe, on his death bed, asked him to search Sweeney's room, where he found a container of arsenic. Wythe changed his will on June 1, to disinherit Sweeney. Because hearsay evidence was excluded by law, the jury's verdict on September 8 was not guilty.

He was President of the German Geological Society from 1863 to 1873. Life He was born in Berlin the son of pharmacologist Valentin Rose. Rose was a graduate of the University of Berlin, where he was a student of mineralogist Christian Samuel Weiss (1780–1856). He also studied under Swedish physical chemist Jöns Jakob Berzelius (1779–1848) in Stockholm. While studying with Berzelius, Rose met German chemist Eilhard Mitscherlich (1794–1863), with whom he maintained a lifelong friendship. Rose provided assistance to Mitscherlich's development of the law of isomorphism. In 1826 he became an associate professor of mineralogy in Berlin. In 1829, with German naturalists Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859) and Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg (1795–1876), Rose took part in a scientific expedition throughout Imperial Russia. In Russia he performed mineralogical studies in the Altai and Ural Mountains, as well as in the region of the Caspian Sea. In 1856 he was appointed director of the Royal Mineralogical Museum. From 1863 up until his death he was president of the German Geological Society.  Research  Gustav Rose made important contributions in the fields of petrology and crystallography, and is credited for pioneering usage of the reflective goniometer in Germany. He had a particular interest in the relationship between the crystalline form and the physical properties of minerals. He is credited for developing a mineral system that was a combination of chemistry, isomorphy and morphology. Rose conducted studies of quartz, feldspars, granites, and the mineralogical components of trap rock. He is remembered for research on meteorites and chondrules (grains found in some types of meteorites). With Gustav Tschermak von Seysenegg (1836–1927) and Aristides Brezina (1848–1909), the \\"Rose-Tschermak-Brezina classification\\" system of meteorites was developed. He identified many minerals new to science, including perovskite, named in honor of Russian mineralogist Lev Aleksevich von Perovski (1792–1856). A rose-colored mineral named roselite is named after Rose, and he is credited with coining the terms howardite and eucrite.

On accepting to plea for pardon on a TV show- trial, she and some other co-defendants were freed after a while. Two of the group's members were executed however and some spent long-term prison sentences in jail. After regaining her freedom, she began writing again and in 1977 was able to obtain permission to travel abroad. She settled for some time in London but before long returned home to witness the Revolution of 1978-1979. After the new regime came to power, she was arrested again and was released only after the intervention of some Human Rights activists, notably Abdolkarim Lahiji of International Federation of Human Rights Leagues. She returned to London to begin her life in exile in 1980. Her works in this period comprises publishing of a socio-political periodical called Moghāvemat (مقاومت - Resistance), and a socio-literary periodical called Mamnu'e-hā (ممنوعه ها - The Forbiddens). She co-edited the latter with the late Manouchehr Mahjoubi. She also wrote a pamphlet on the historical conditions of Iranian women called Say'r-e nozuli-ye moghe'iyyat-e zan az āghaz tā eslām (سير نزولی موقعيت زن از آغاز تا اسلام - The downward trend of the social status of women from beginning until Islam). Together with Esmail Nooriala, she co-edited a literary magazine called Puyeshgarān (پويشگران - Explorers) for eight years. She founded the Iranian Women Organization of Great Britain and participated in the foundation of Society for Iranian Writers and Artists in Britain. She also has founded the Center for Iranian Women's Documents and Studies in the United States. Her first major novel, Bigāneh-yi dar man (بيگانه ای در من - A Stranger Within Me), was published in 1993. Three years later, she published a collection of her short stories Golden Ārk (گلدن آرک - Golden Ark) and in 1987 she wrote and staged a play with feminist themes. The English translation of Bigāneh-yi dar man, A Stranger Within Me, was published in 2000. Her other works have been translated into French, German and Japanese. She has also published numerous articles on literary and social subjects during her time in the United Kingdom and, now, the USA, and has widely travelled and lectured on literary and socio-feminist subjects. She and her husband, Esmail Nooriala, immigrated to the United States in 1995, where between 2001 and 2005 they produced and hosted two weekly television programs, Kārgāh-e Andisheh (کارگاه انديشه - The Thought Workshop) and Bar Miz-e Tashrih (بر ميز تشريح - On the Operating Table). The main emphasis of these programs were on subjects related to women, human rights and political prisoners. The programs were broadcast via satellite and reached the entire globe, including Iran. In August 2005, on finding that when Sivand Dam in the Fars Province, Iran, became operational, the archaeological sites of the Pasargadae Plains would be inundated, she, together with another individual, founded the International Committee to Save the Archaeological Sites of the Pasargadae Plains, and has since then supervised the activities of its international branches.

She comes from a small town to Düsseldorf and has the dream to become rich and famous. To obtain a job in the 'Lahnstein Holding', she charms her way in by claiming to be the girlfriend of Constantin von Lahnstein (Milan Marcus). Constantin's brother Ansgar (Wolfram Grandezka) gives her the job of the assistant. Constantin then asks her a favor for not telling his brother that he and Olivia never actually were a couple. He wants Olivia to get between and break up Andi Fritzsche (Dominic Saleh-Zaki), the new boyfriend of Lisa Brandner (Lilli Hollunder), who is Constantin's ex and who he is still in love with. Olivia agrees and makes it look like that she and Andi had sex in the elevator. When they get caught by Lisa, Olivia held her promise to Constantin. Olivia has a very complicated relationship with her aunt Charlie. Charlie could never stand her niece and knows about her little schemes. But Charlie is scared of Olivia when she comes back to Düsseldorf, because she knows a secret from her past that could destroy the relationship with her brother Lars forever. Olivia blackmails her aunt and her plan works. To hurt Charlie, she sleeps with Charlie's fiancé Bernd von Beyenbach (Ron Holzschuh), who didn't know Olivia was Charlie's niece. Olivia tells Charlie about her night with Bernd and that he was only after Charlie's money anyway. Charlie ends the relationship with Bernd and is heartbroken. Meanwhile, Andi tries to prove that he never slept with Olivia and sees his chance, when he finds out about Charlie's complicated relationship with Olivia. Charlie agrees to help Andi to discover Olivia's scheme against him and Lisa, but is once again blackmailed by her niece, when she and Andi found avedence. Charlie has no other choice and destroys everything, much to Andi's detriment. Olivia wants to make career and begins an affair with Ansgar to have the right man on her side to do so. At this time, Ansgar is married to Nathalie (Jenny Winkler), but hasn't any problem to be seen with Olivia as his mistress. While her affair with Ansgar, Olivia begins to fall for Andi and tries to improve herself for him. But eventually, she starts her little games again and makes Andi believe that she dates a biker. Andi and Olivia get closer and sleep together, but Olivia doesn't want to lose her status and the money she gets from Ansgar. When he has enough of the affair with her, Olivia claims to be pregnant with his child. With that lie, Olivia tries to get more money out of him for an abortion, but Ansgar has other plans. He wants Olivia to give birth to the child and give it to him with relinquishment of her maternal rights. Olivia's plan gets completely out of control, when Andi thinks she is pregnant with his child and wants to be there for her. She begins to fall in love with the idea of a family with Andi and goes on with her lies. When the truth comes out, she not only loses Ansgar's money, she loses Andi too, who eventually leaves town. After that, Olivia can finally make peace with her aunt Charlie, when her cousin Oliver Sabel (Jo Weil) returns to town. She begins to work as a waitress in Charlie's bistro, but soon sees that she wants more in her life. Olivia gets a job as assistant in the model agency of Tanja von Anstetten (Miriam Lahnstein). Charlie and Oliver try to warn her, but nobody can stop her. She soon needs to see for herself how unpredictable Tanja is, when she uses Olivia as a drug dealer for Sarah Hofmann (Sina-Valeska Jung), one of her models. But Olivia stays with Tanja and hopes that she might get her big chance one day and work as a model herself. Later on in the show, she discovers Oliver's secret relationship with Christian after a drunken night at their apartment and crashing into Christian's bed and discovers the two naked under the covers together asleep. She appears surprised, but soon swears to secrecy on the account they owe her a favor in exchange, using their secret as leverage for future blackmail. This proves true when she decides to use the boxing club as well as Christian himself for a modeling shoot, much to his and Gregor's annoyance since he had to impress a big time coach in a short while. At first Christian refuses, but when she threatens to expose his true sexuality to Gregor, who does not know about Christian being gay, he begrudgingly accepts. Olivia's dream comes true after she proves herself several times to Tanja and gets a deal. But from the beginning Olivia seems to be a hard model to work with. At two photo shootings she presents herself as a diva and gets almost fired until she learns how to be in that job. Olivia gets another problem, when she becomes the new face of a fashion label and even takes nude photos of herself, claiming all the big stars do it. The photographer of these photos tries to blackmail her. Afraid of being fired she wants to pay him, but Oliver realizes the problems of his cousin and helps her out together with Sebastian von Lahnstein (Joscha Kiefer). After this, Sebastian and Olivia get closer and become even something like good friends. Sebastian, who comes out of a complicated relationship with Lydia Brandner (Theresa Underberg), finds his laugh again, when he is with Olivia. She gets more and more interested in him and after the name was the first thing that was attractive to her, Olivia finds herself falling for Sebastian. But Sebastian's good behavior has a reason - another reason than a friendship. He betted with Elisabeth von Lahnstein (Martina Servatius) about Olivia's image. While Elisabeth doesn't believe that Olivia will ever be good enough for the higher class, Sebastian tries to teach her. Even hurt when she finds out about the bet, Olivia agrees to help Sebastian win it. In her last episodes of the series, Olivia owes several people money, but refuses to take a job as a waitress again and soon finds herself on the streets, nowhere to go since no one wants her around, including Oliver. Wanting to look for a Hollywood-like job, she comes across an ad in the paper for people who wish to become Hollywood stars. However, she finds out that she needs to make a hands down $2,000 payment as an investment. She reaches out to Oliver to loan her the money, but he bluntly refuses to. After failing to convince other people as well to loan her the cash, she steals the money from Oliver and what he made at NoLimits that night and takes off with the money. She then goes for her audition, singing a song, and seems to make an impression on the man running the project and gives him the money. He promises to make her a star and she goes to NoLimits to tell everyone of her supposed success. Oliver is furious at her for stealing from him, telling her that she took more than 2 grande from him. Olivia says she'll pay him \\"when she becomes a star\\" and how she found an agent to do so, even though everyone insists that the whole thing was likely a scam, which she refuses to consider. Olivia then makes her exit after she continues to claim to Oliver and Christian that she is going to become a big star in Hollywood. After she gives a movie-like performance, she walks out of the NoLimits with her suitcases behind her in hand. Thinking she is on her way to something bigger, she overlooks a foundation ditch and falls right into it and is knocked unconscious. A truck then proceeds to dump a large load of cement on top of her, filling the hole completely, leaving the viewers to assume that Olivia was buried alive. Later, as part of another story line Olli jokingly says he would send her an invitation to an upcoming event but can't because she has never given him her address in L.A. This is the last time the character is mentioned in the programme.

Story March 27, 2004 an apartment building in Brockton, MA caught on fire resulting in two injured persons and hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages. A stove in one of the apartments malfunctioned and fed gas back into the ventilation system. The gas poured into the entire room and eventually combusted. Initial investigations revealed traces of flammable liquids soaked in various fabrics within the apartment. An arson investigation began soon after the discovery. Police targeted two men: Frank Iannetta and John Deacon. Ianetta, the owner and superintendent of the apartment building would often delegate the electrical work to John Deacon. On March 27, John Deacon had been working on the 4th floor installing new outlets in compliance with health and safety regulations. A week before the fire, Iannetta received a 2nd notice to make a number of repairs or the building would be condemned. The investigators took Iannetta and Deacon in for questioning. Ianetta confessed to setting up the fire to collect insurance money and also claimed that Deacon had sabotaged the stove to feedback into the room. Frank Ianetta was convicted of conspiracy and sentenced to three years in prison and ten years probation. John Deacon was convicted of arson and conspiracy and was sentenced to nine years, six months in prison and ten years probation. About a year and a half later, a similar fire occurred in Everett, MA. Investigators concluded that the fire was caused by flashover. Flashover is the simultaneous combustion of anything flammable within one area. Flashover occurs when smoke consumes all of the oxygen within a room. As the oxygen decreases, the temperature increases until it reaches the \\"fire point,\\" or 600 degrees Celsius. The Everett flashover case resulted in similar cases to be re-examined, including Deacon/Ianettas case. This time, investigators concluded that there was no foul play after all and that flashover had occurred. John Deacon's conviction was overturned and Frank Ianetta, who had already been released nine months prior, was taken off probation. Production On July 8, 2007, April Deacon placed a want ad on craigslist asking for help in making a documentary about her father's highly publicized and heavily scrutinized release from prison. April felt that the media was treating her father unfairly and wanted to take some action to clear her innocent father's name. April and her brother Aden had already begun shooting some introductory scenes with her own Sony handi-cam. A few of these scenes were included in the film's final cut and act as an introduction to her father's story. Within a few days, a small production crew ([82Films]) took on her project. Paul Medico and Sean O'Connor served as directors and Amanda McGrady as producer. April also joined as producer and general consultant. The crew shot on two Canon XH-A1 High Definition cameras. Principal photography took place over four weeks from July 10- August 7 (including April original footage). Filming took place in and around Greater Boston. Controversy April Deacon was purportedly given the final approval of the documentary, however, has publicly boycotted the final version of the film claiming that it tarnishes her father's image. Screenings The Flashover world premiere occurred on June 13, 2008 at The Boston International Film Festival. The screening took place at the Loews/AMC Boston Common theater at 6:00PM. The mockumentary won the \\"Best Short Film\\" award at the festival. Flashover also screened on July 26, 2008 at The Woods Hole Film Festival.

Plot  The book begins in Sudan, where God, disguised as a Dinka woman, attempts to help out around a refugee camp. She speaks with the American diplomats visiting the camp, including former Secretary of State Colin Powell, about finding the missing brother of the body she inhabits. While she is there, the camp is attacked by the Sudanese government, killing everyone, including God. The rest of the book focuses on how things unravel after God's death. A high school graduate watches in horror as a priest commits suicide. Soon after, a group of childhood friends form a suicide pact after all their relatives die in the chaos. People later begin to worship their children in the absence of religion, while the psychiatrists tasked to disrupt such unproductive behavior are the most hated people alive. The dogs who ate God's corpse are revealed to possess a higher knowledge, but this brings only death to all but one of them. The book closes with a view into war in this Godless world, where religious wars have been replaced by ideological wars between supporters of evolutionary psychology versus postmodernism.

Love was the fourth rector, promoted to prior upon the incorporation of Mount Grace in 1411. The latest documentary occurrence of his name is 15 March 1423, and his death, as \\"former prior\\" is recorded in 1424.David M. Smith, \\"The Heads of Religious Houses: England and Wales, vol. 3, 1377-1540. Cambridge University Press, 2008, p362. Love translated the popular Franciscan meditational manual Meditations on the Life of Christ into English, as The Mirror of the Blessed Life of Jesus Christ. The \\"Meditationes\\" was at the time attributed to Bonaventure, but is now recognised to be by an unknown author, and hence is attributed to Pseudo-Bonaventure, although attempts have been made to identify its author, and it is possible that it was written by an Italian Franciscan, John de Caulibus).Bernard McGinn, The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism, (New York, Herder & Herder, 2012), p488. Around the year 1410, Love submitted his \\"Mirror\\" to Thomas Arundel, Archbishop of Canterbury, in conformity with the strictures of the Oxford Constitutions of 1407–09, which had forbidden all new translations of biblical material in any form, without the submission of the material to the local bishop for approval. The archbishop had taken this action in an attempt to stop the circulation of the Wycliffite translation of the Bible and other heretical Wycliffite (Lollard) writings.Anne Hudson, \\"The Premature Reformation: Wycliffite Texts and Lollard History\\" (Oxford: at the Clarendon Press, 1988), pp437-40. Love's translation in fact includes a number of major additions to the original Latin text, arguing specifically against the positions of John Wycliffe and his followers on, e.g., the Church hierarchy, almsgiving, and the sacraments of Penance and the Eucharist. (An additional chapter on the Eucharist is sometimes referred to separately, as A Short Treatise of the Highest and Most Worthy Sacrament of Christ's Body and Its Miracles.) Archbishop Arundel not merely approved of Love's translation, he personally endorsed its circulation, and it appears to have been disseminated in manuscript primarily from the early fifteenth-century book production centers in London and Westminster, rather than from Mount Grace. The \\"Mirror\\" was remarkably popular: there are 64 surviving manuscripts and 6 printings made before 1535.Michael G. Sargent, \\"What do the Numbers Mean? A Textual Critic's Observations on some Patterns of Middle English Manuscript Transmission\\", \\"Design and Distribution of Late Medieval Manuscripts in England\\", ed. by Margaret Connolly and Linne R. Mooney (York Medieval Press, 2008), pp. 205-44. Later in life, Love complained to King Henry V about the laxity of the discipline of the Benedictine monks in England, inciting him to call an extraordinary convocation of the order at Westminster to answer a bill of thirteen charges that Love, a former Benedictine himself, had apparently drawn up. Love was one of the King's three delegates to the reform commission that derived from this convocation, but both he and the king died before any actual reforms were effected.\\"Note on the Meeting of 1421\\", \\"Documents Illustrating the Activities of the General and Provincial Chapters of the English Black Monks, 1215-1540\\", vol. 2, ed. by William Abel Pantin (London: Camden Society, 1933), pp. 98-134.

They are involved in the phosphophatidylinositol [PI] signaling pathway, which affects a wide array of cell functions, including but not limited to, cell growth, apoptosis, secretion, and information processing. Inhibition of inositol monophosphatase may be key in the action of lithium in treating bipolar disorder, specifically manic depression. The catalyzed reaction: :myo-inositol phosphate + H2O \\\\rightleftharpoons myo-inositol + phosphate  Nomenclature  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is myo-inositol- phosphate phosphohydrolase.

Structure  The enzyme is a dimer comprising 277 amino acid residues per subunit. Each dimer exists in 5 layers of alternating α-helices and β-sheets, totaling to 9 α-helices and β-sheets per subunit. IMPase has three hydrophilic hollow active sites, each of which bind water and magnesium molecules. These binding sites appear to be conserved in other phosphodiesterases such as fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) and inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase.  Catalytic mechanism  It was previously reported that the hydrolysis of inositol monophosphate was catalyzed by IMPase through a 2-magnesium ion mechanism. However a recent 1.4 A resolution crystal structure shows 3 magnesium ions coordinating in each active binding site of the 2 dimers, supporting a 3-magnesium ion mechanism. The mechanism for hydrolysis is now thought to proceed as such: the enzyme is activated by a magnesium ion binding to binding site I, containing three water molecules, and stabilized by the negative charges on the carboxylates of Glu70 and Asp90, and the carbonyl of Ile92. Another magnesium ion then cooperatively binds to binding site 2, which has of carboxylates of Asp90, Asp93, Asp220, and three water molecules, one of which is shared by binding site 1. Then, a third magnesium weakly and non- cooperatively to the third binding site, which has 5 water molecules and residue Glu70. After all three magnesium ions have bound, the inositol monophosphatase can bind, the negatively charge phosphate group stabilized by the three positively charged magnesium ions. Finally an activated water molecule acts a nucleophile and hydrolyzes the substrate, giving inositol and inorganic phosphate.  Function  Inositol monophosphatase plays an important role in maintaining intracellular levels of myo-inositol, a molecule that forms the structural basis of several secondary messengers in eukaryotic cells. IMPase dephosphorylates the isomers of inositol monophosphate to produce inositol, mostly in the form of the stereoisomer, myo-inositol. Inositol monophosphatase is able to regulate inositol homeostasis because it lies at the convergence of two pathways that generate inositol: *The phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway *The de novo biosynthesis of inositol from glucose 6-phosphate IMPase in the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway In this pathway, G-coupled protein receptors and tyrosine kinase receptors are activated, resulting in the activation of phospholipase C (PLC). PLC hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol biphosphate (PIP2), resulting in a membrane associated product, diacylglycerol (DAG), and a water-soluble product, inositol triphosphate (IP3). DAG acts as a second messenger, activating several protein kinases and produces extended downstream signaling. IP3 is also a second messenger which activates receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ion stores into the cytoplasm, creating a complex signaling system that can be involved in modulating fertilization, proliferation, contraction, cell metabolism, vesicle and fluid secretion, and information processing in neuronal cells. Overall, DAG and IP3 signaling has implications for neuronal plasticity, impacting hippocampal long term potentiation, stress-induced cognitive impairment, and neuronal growth cone spreading. Furthermore, not only is PIP2 a precursor to several signaling molecules, it can be phosphorylated at the 3’ position to become PIP3, which is involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell movement. In this pathway, IMPase is the common, final step in recycling IP3 to produce PIP2. IMPase does this by dephosphorylating inositol monophosphate to produce inorganic phosphate and myo-inositol, the precursor to PIP2. Because of IMPase's crucial role in this signaling pathway, it is a potential drug target for inhibition and modulation. IMPase in the de novo synthesis of myo- inositol There are at least 2 known steps in the de novo synthesis of myo- inositol from glucose 6-phosphate. In the first step, glucose 6-phosphate is converted to D-inositol 1 monophosphate by the enzyme glucose 6 phosphate cyclase. Inositol monophosphatase catalyzes the final step in which D-inositol 1 monophosphate is dephosphorylated to form myo-inositol.  Clinical significance  Inositol monophosphatase has historically been believed to be a direct target of lithium, the primary treatment for bipolar disorder. It is thought that lithium acts according to the inositol depletion hypothesis: lithium produces its therapeutic effect by inhibiting IMPase and therefore decreasing levels of myo-inositol. Scientific support for this hypothesis exists but is limited; the complete role of lithium and inositol monophosphatase in treating bipolar disorder or reducing myo-inositol levels is not well understood. In support of the inositol depletion hypothesis, researchers have shown that lithium binds uncompetitively to purified bovine IMPase at the site of one of the magnesium ions. Rodents administered lithium showed a decrease in inositol levels, in line with the hypothesis. Valproate, another mood-stabilizing drug given to bipolar disorder patients, has also been shown to mimic the effects of lithium on myo-inositol. However, some clinical studies have found that bipolar disorder patients that had been administered lithium showed lower myo-inositol levels, while others found no effect on myo-inositol levels. Furthermore, lithium also binds to inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase (IPP), an enzyme also present in the phosphoinositide pathway, and could lower inositol levels through this mechanism More research is required to fully explain the role that lithium and IMPase play in bipolar disorder patients. Despite the fact that lithium is effective in treating bipolar disorder, it is extremely toxic metal and the toxic dose is only marginally greater than the therapeutic dose. A novel inhibitor of IMPase that is less toxic could be a more desirable treatment for bipolar disorder. Such an inhibitor would need to cross the blood–brain barrier in order to reach the IMPase in neurons.  References   Further reading    Cockcroft, S.

For example, the juvenile hormone II (found in Lepidoptera): :methyl (2E,6E)-(10R,11S)-10,11-epoxy-3,7,11-trimethyltrideca-2,6-dienoate + H2O \\\\rightleftharpoons (2E,6E)-(10R,11S)-10,11-epoxy-3,7,11-trimethyltrideca-2,6-dienoic acid + methanol.  Nomenclature and function  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is methyl-(2E,6E)-(10R,11S)-10,11-epoxy-3,7,11-trimethyltrideca-2,6-dienoate acylhydrolase. Other names in common use include JH esterase, juvenile hormone esterase, and juvenile hormone carboxyesterase. Juvenile hormone (JH) controls insect metamorphosis.Gilbert et al., 1977 High JH titers maintain the larval state while a decrease in the JH titer initiates the pupation sequence Nijhout and Williams, 1974 as well as a change in tissue commitment away from synthesis of larval tissues to pupal tissues at the pupal stage.Riddiford, 1976 The drop in JH titer at the beginning of the last larval instar in the Lepidoptera appears to be due to a combination of increased metabolism Nowock and GILBERT, 1976a; Sanburg et al., 1975a; Sanburg et al., 1975b and decreased synthesis.Nijhout, 1975 In the Lepidoptera, JH is initially metabolized by ester hydrolysis;Hammock and Quistad, 1976; Slade and Zibitt, 1972 esterases capable of hydrolyzing JH are detectable in the hemolymph at times during the last larval instar that appear to coincide with reported drops in the JH titre.Vince and Gilbert, 1977:Sparks, 1979 #1170; Weirich and Wren, 1973 The JHE's are also selective for the 2E methyl ester of the naturally occurring JH's.Hammock et al., 1977; Weirich and Wren, 1973; Weirich and Wren, 1976 These studies suggest that the JHE's may be important in the regulation of the JH titre and therefore involved in the initiation of and the commitment to the pupal stage. JHE's appear to be produced by the fat body Hammock et al., 1975; Nowock and Gilbert, 1976b; Whitmore et al., 1974 and this production can be stimulated by exogenous JH in Hyalophora pupae, a stage devoid of JHE activity.Whitmore, 1972 #1160;Whitmore et al., 1974 Stimulation of JHE activity by JH has also been noted recently in adults of Leptinotarsa decemlineata Kramer, 1978 and pupae of Galleria mellonella.Reddy et al., 1979 However, to date, no reported studies have examined this phenomenon during the last larval instar when these enzymes are thought to be of primary importance. Thus this laboratory undertook an investigation of the hemolymph JHE regulation during the last larval instar of the cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni. JH esterase induction Juvenile hormone esterase is induced by factors naturally occurring in the head of insects.Jones et al., 1980 In addition, it is induced by treatment of insects with either natural juvenile hormone, with JH I being the most potent inducer.Sparks and Hammock, 1979 Synthetic agonists of JH have been shown to possess this same activity, albeit at a lower potency than JH I.Sparks et al., 1979 In another study, it has been shown that factors present in the head of the insect are potent inducers of JH activity.Jones et al., 1980 Starvation of lepidopteran larvae also induces appearance of JH esterase.Sparks et al., 1983 JH esterase inhibitors A number of compounds have been discovered which are potent inhibitors of JH esterase. Many of these are insecticides falling into two major structural groups, the phosphoamidothiolates and S-phenylphosphates; carbamate insecticides were also tested.Hammock et al., 1977 By far the most potent inhibitor was an ethoxythiophenylphospamidothiolate, with IC50 < 1 nM. Of particular interest in this study is that ethyl and isopropyl analogs of natural JHs were NOT cleaved by the esterase, showing that it is methyl ester specific. JH I and JH III were tested at nominal concentrations of 5 μM. Later a trifluoromethyl ketone (3-octylthio-1,1,1-trifluoro-2-propanone) was shown to be a highly potent, high affinity slow, tight binding inhibitor of the JH esterase of Trichoplusia ni, the same Lepidopteran which was used in the other study in this section.Abdel-Aal et al., 1984 This study reported very sophisticated kinetic analyses of the inhibition of this compound (acronym OTFP), JH I was shown to be degraded more readily by the enzyme than JH III, with a Km value about twice the value of JH III. JH esterase fluctuations with time and relation to insect development JH esterase and JH epoxide hydrolase are crucial in terminating the action of JH. The role of juvenile hormone binding proteins are also important, as they afford juvenile hormone protection from hydrolytic enzymes.Braun and Wyatt, 1995; De Kort and Granger, 1996; Plapp et al., 1998; Prestwich et al., 1996 This makes for a very complicated scenario that is difficult to investigate, and also difficult to distinguish between different species. Very detailed studies have been done on JH, JH acid, ecdysone, and JH titers have been done in precisely timed larvae of Manduca sexta as a function of development during the fifth larval stadium. In these larvae the principle JH are JH I, and JH II, with low levels of JH 0 and JH III. There is a large peak of JH I and II at the end of the fourth stadium, accompanied by lower levels of their acid metabolites. Then a broad peak of JH esterase starts on day 1.5 to day 4. Subsequently, ecdysteroid titers rise slightly on day 3.5, then a massive peak of ecdysteroid starting on day 5 persisting at somewhat lower levels to day 5. This is accompanied by a sharp peak of JH I and JH II, beginning on day 4 and ending on day 6. JH I acid titers are almost the same as JH I titer, except on day 7 when is a sharp peak of only JH I acid. This is just as ecdysteroid titers are decreasing.Baker et al., 1987 A very similar timing of peaks of JH esterase and ecdysone has been observed in Galleria mellonella.Hwanghsu et al., 1979 These data are consistent with a classical model for lepidopterans where JH is high at each larval molt, but must rise together with ecdysone prior to pupation to initiate the pupal molt. They are also consistent with a model advanced by others that corpora allata maintained in vitro of day 0 M. sexta larva secrete high levels of JH, but that the shift to producing only JH acid at day 4, which is then methylated by imaginal discs to generate the JH peak.Sparagana et al., 1985; Sparagana et al., 1984 However, secretion of the relative amounts of JH produced by CA of Manduca sexta has been found to differ considerably from in vivo titers.Baker et al., 1987 Investigation of JH titers in Trichoplusia ni have led to very similar conclusions as regards the timing of pulses of JH temporally and with respect to edysone secretion. However, the principle JH in this species is JH II. Injection of an esterase inhibitor, EPPAT, was found to increase juvenile hormone titers, and starvation was found to increase juvenile hormone titers. In addition, parasitization of larvae with Chelonus sp. (Hymenoptera) was found to decrease JH II titers, but to cause an increase in JH III titers, apparently derived from the parasite.Jones et al., 1990 JH esterase protein structure The crystal structure of esterase from the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta has been solved in complex with the transition state analogue inhibitor 3-octylthio-1,1,1-trifluoropropan-2-one (OTFP) covalently bound to the active site. This crystal structure contains a long, hydrophobic binding pocket with the solvent-inaccessible catalytic triad located at the end. The structure explains many of the interactions observed between JHE and its substrates and inhibitors, such as the preference for methyl esters vs. ethyl or isopropyl esters, and long hydrophobic backbones.Wogulis et al., 2006 The enzyme is extremely efficient, with a cat/Km of at least 3 x 107 M-1 s-1. The primary sequence is 583 amino acids long, with a 22 amino acid protein. The calculated Mr of the active form is 62.1 kDa. Written References Abdel-Aal, Y.A.I., Roe, R., Hammock, B.D., 1984.

The group set unsurpassed record for bombing accuracy on 15 April 1945, holding the record for bombing accuracy in the Eighth Air Force. They destroyed a German battery at Pointe de Grave, on the west coast of France and scored a 100 per cent strike. The group commander, Colonel Albert J. Shower, was the only group commander to stay with the same group from beginning to the end of the war. Returned to the United States in July 1945, converted to B-29 Superfortresses and trained for deployment to the Pacific Theater. Deployment to Okinawa cancelled with the end of the Pacific War in August 1945. After training completed, assigned to Clovis AAF, New Mexico and was one of the original ten USAAF bombardment groups assigned to Strategic Air Command on 21 March 1946. The group was inactivated on 4 August 1946 due to the Air Force's policy of retaining only low-numbered groups on active duty after the war, and its B-29 aircraft, personnel and equipment were reassigned to the senior 301st Bombardment Group at Smoky Hill Army Airfield, Kansas.

This aircraft crash landed at RAF Bungay on 5 May 1945 after fire in the nose. Established as a B-24 Liberator heavy bombardment group in mid-1943 at Mountain Home Army Air Field, Idaho, and activated on 8 September. Transferred to Kearns Center, Utah for personnel assignment and organization then sent to Wendover Field, Utah for combat training on 1 November. In January the group received deployment orders for the European Theater of Operations (ETO). On 12 February 1944 the ground unit went by train to Camp Shanks, New York. They sailed on the on 28 February 1944 and arrived in Clyde on 10 March 1944. The aircraft left Wendover on 12 February 1944 and took the southern Atlantic ferry route. One B-24 was lost with all the crew over the Atlas mountains. Moved to RAF Rackheath, Norfolk in England, February–March 1944, and was assigned to the VIII Bomber Command. The group was assigned to the 96th Combat Bombardment Wing, and the group tail code was a \\"Circle-P\\". The mission of the 467th was to engage in very long range strategic bombardment operations over Occupied Europe and Nazi Germany. The group began operations on 10 April 1944 with an attack by thirty aircraft on an airfield at Bourges in central France. In combat, the unit served chiefly as a strategic bombardment organization, attacking the harbor at Kiel, chemical plants at Bonn, textile factories at Stuttgart, power plants at Hamm, steel works at Osnabrück, the aircraft industry at Brunswick, and other objectives. In addition to strategic operations, engaged occasionally in support and interdictory missions. Bombed shore installations and bridges near Cherbourg on D-Day, 6 June 1944. Struck enemy troop and supply concentrations near Montreuil on 25 July 1944 to assist the Allied drive across France. In September, over two weeks the bombers flew gasoline from Rackheath to Clastres Airfield (A-71) France for use by the US mechanized forces. Attacked German communications and fortifications during the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944 – January 1945. Hit enemy transportation to assist the Allied assault across the Rhine in March 1945. After the German Capitulation in May 1945, the group was ordered back to the United States for B-29 transition and redeployment to the Pacific Theater of Operations (PTO). Redeployed to the US June/July 1945. The air echelon departed Rackheath on 12 June 1945. The ground units sailed from Greenock on the Queen Mary on 6 July 1945. They arrived in New York on 11 July 1945. Upon arrival, most of the group was demobilized due to their combat service in Europe; a cadre of officers and men was formed at Sioux Falls Army Air Field, South Dakota on 25 August. At Sioux Falls, the unit was redesignated as the 467th Bombardment Group (Very Heavy) in August and was reformed with newly trained pilots, aircrews and ground personnel. The reformed group was sent to Harvard Army Airfield, Nebraska for initial Second Air Force training then on to Phase II training at Alamogordo Army Airfield, New Mexico where the group trained on worn II Bomber Command B-17s and some pre-production YB-29s used for aircrew training. The Japanese Capitulation in early August canceled the planned deployment to the Pacific, however the group continued to train Due to the advanced training state of the unit, it was reassigned to Harvard Army Airfield, Nebraska, where the group received new B-29 Superfortresses and completed training. In December 1945 was assigned to a permanent base at Clovis AAF, New Mexico as part of Continental Air Forces. Engaged in strategic bombardment training operations on a reduced scale upon arrival at Clovis, as many personnel were being demobilized. On 21 March 1946, was assigned as one of the initial units of the new Strategic Air Command. The unit, however was inactivated on 4 August due to personnel shortages and funding reductions in the immediate postwar Air Force. The equipment and remaining personnel were reassigned to other SAC units, primarily the 301st Bombardment Group at Smoky Hill Army Airfield, Kansas.

None of Nunziata's works can be identified today. Most of what we know about him comes from a single passage by Giorgio Vasari, in the 1568 edition of the Vite, within the Life of Ridolfo, David, and Benedetto Ghirlandaio. Too young to have known Nunziata personally, Vasari shaped him into a literary character: the joking painter in the tradition of Franco Sacchetti's novelle about Giotto and the fabled Buffalmacco. Nunziata belonged to the class of plebeian artists, and Vasari generally omitted their works. His story represents a part of Florentine art outside Vasari's canon, that became art history's. His son Antonio, also a painter, left to work in England in 1519, and as Anthony Toto became court artist or Serjeant Painter to Henry VIII and Edward VI. Life Nunziata's life and career are very sparsely documented. By 1499 we know that Nunziata had joined the Compagnia di San Luca, the Florentine artists’ confraternity. The artist was also listed in the Compagnia's membership book of 1503-5, the so-called Libro rosso. In 1515 he was paid for painting a cross in SS. Annunziata, in preparation for the consecration of the church by Leo X. A notarial document of 1507 that names him as a member of another confraternity, the Compagnia di San Girolamo, called il Ciottolino, which met ‘below the church of Santa Maria sopr’Arno’. In 1512, the deliberations of the Florentine Signoria reveal that Nunziata and his friend Ridolfo Ghirlandaio were then working—alongside the painters Francesco di Niccolò Dolzemele, Jacopo di Francesco di Domenico, Bastiano di Bartolomeo Mazzanti, and Piero di Giorgio—on the decoration of the Palazzo Vecchio. Nunziata was paid in August of that year for painting nine coats of arms on the new windows that looked out over the dogana or customs-office. The anomaly of Nunziata's place in the history of art begins with his name—styled after none other than the Annunciate Virgin Mary. It was a name exceedingly rare in fifteenth-century Florence, whether in its male or female form. Indeed, the only other Florentine known to have received it during the fifteenth century was a foundling baptized in 1470—but significantly, even in this case her given name was ‘Onesta’, and she received ‘Nunziata’ only as her baptismal name (which would never be used again after the baptismal ceremony). In documents the painter's name appears in both the feminine version cited by Vasari and in the masculine form, Nunziato. It is the latter that appears in the newly discovered record of the artist's birth and baptism, which dates from 22 October 1468. Until now Nunziata's birthdate was erroneously given in the literature as 1475. A document of 1517 names Nunziata and his son Toto as witnesses to the will of a legnaiuolo named Giuseppe di Lorenzo in the parish of San Pancrazio in September 1517. Surprisingly, here Nunziata is identified not as a painter but as a bombardier (‘Nunziato Antonii Dominici bombardiere’). Apparently as an old man he must have fallen upon hard times. It was common for out-of-work craftsmen to moonlight as bombardiers (well- known examples include Raffaello da Montelupo and Zanobi Lastricati), though it was generally the province of masters in the more physically demanding arts, such as cannon-founders, sculptors, and scalpellini. Nunziata is a rare, if not unique example of a Renaissance painter working as a bombardier. In all likelihood the skills of mixing and manipulating gunpowder to create his fuochi d’artificio turned out to be easily transferable to the job of an artilleryman when there was not enough painting work to stave the wolf from the door. On 28 September 1519 Nunziata personally came forward to give his blessing as his son Antonio, called Toto del Nunziata, contracted to work abroad with Pietro Torrigiani for four and a half years. Prior to this time, Vasari relates that Toto had worked in the shop of Nunziata's friend Ridolfo Ghirlandaio where he had painted a number of pictures that were sent to England (just as his fellow studio assistant Bartolomeo Ghetti is said to have made paintings that were sent to King Francis I of France before he himself departed for the French court). At the time Toto signed on with Torrigiani he was several months past his twenty-first birthday; technically, therefore, his father's permission was not required for the contract. Nunziata may have wished to give his formal assent in order to ensure that there would be no qualms about the legitimacy of Toto's contract. On the other hand, his recollection of his son Toto's exact age may merely have been a bit shaky. The painting business must have been looking up by 1521, just as Nunziata's personal affairs were hitting the rocks. In July of that year a decree of the Florentine criminal court of the Otto di Guardia e Balìa again refers to him as ‘pictor’ in a judgment by which they condemned him to pay a four-florin fine to the magistracy, to hand over two florins to a certain Andrea di Biagio, and to satisfy an unspecified debt to Andrea's son Biagio. The substantial fine that the artist was sentenced to pay to the court (in addition to what he owed the plaintiffs) implies that Nunziata was also being punished for some kind of misdeed, though its nature is not made clear by the magistrates’ decree. Vasari's account Vasari described Nunziata as a ‘dipintore di fantocci’. Literally this means a painter of dolls or puppets, and it is in just such a literal sense that scholars have generally interpreted Vasari's epithet. Yet such an interpretation overlooks several important problems. First, there was no special profession of doll-painter or puppet-painter per se in Renaissance Italy. It is hardly a coincidence that the great myths and fables about professional toymakers—from the Brothers Grimm to Collodi—all belong to the nineteenth century. Further evidence that Vasari meant the phrase ‘dipintore di fantocci’ in a metaphorical sense comes from the context in which he uses the word fantoccio elsewhere in the Lives. On nearly every other occasion in which the word fantoccio or one of its cognates appears in the Lives, Vasari uses it as a term of deprecation to signify a crudely sketched figure, a daub, a work reminiscent of a child's doodles. Thus Vasari uses the term fantoccio to describes Tribolo’s selection to replace the earlier, inept designers of the Florentine fireworks displays (girandole) for the feast of San Giovanni as: ‘certi fantocciai, che avevano già molt’anni fatto…mille gofferie’. He uses the term fantoccio to describe the crude graffiti figures scratched on walls by vandals: ‘una figura che non avessi niente di disegno…goffa, simile a que’ fantocci che fanno coloro che non sanno et imbrattano le mura’. Thus, as Vasari applies the term to Nunziata, ‘pittore di fantocci’ can be considered somewhere on a par with (or below) the writer’s other categories of unskilled or plebeian painters: the despised ‘pittore ordinario,’ such as the painters of ceri (candles), ‘che stanno a bottega aperta publicamente a lavorare ogni cosa meccanica’. In fact, Vasari says that candle painters were so widely known for their crude handiwork ‘che hanno dato il nome ai dipintori plebei (onde si dice alle cattive pitture “fantocci da ceri”)’. But the term could also be applied dismissively to the artistic productions of the Middle Ages: ‘quei fantocci e quelle goffezze che nelle cose vecchie ancora oggi appariscono’. ‘Se bene era dipintore di fantocci’, however, Vasari could still appreciate two things in which Nunziata was a ‘persona rara’. The first was his skill in making the fireworks, and especially the girandole for San Giovanni (evidently he was much more talented in this line than the unnamed girandola-makers succeeding him, whom Vasari disparages as ‘fantocciai’). The other remarkable quality Nunziata possessed, according to the biographer, was his gift of infinite jest, which rendered his company and conversation agreeable to all. Thus Nunziata belongs to that other taxonomy of artists in the Lives such as Bugiardini and Jacopo Indaco who, though dismissed by Vasari as negligible artists, are nonetheless celebrated as burlevoli and faceti. Anecdotes Vasari's two anecdotes about Nunziata's burle are very well known. In the first he tells of a Florentine patron who allegedly ordered Nunziata to paint a Crucifixion for the summer apartments on the camera terrena of his house. The customer was so stupid and inarticulate that he expressed his desire with the ambiguous request for ‘a Crucifixion for the summer’ (un Crucifisso per la state). Playing his client for the ignorant fool that he was, Nunziata painted the crucified Christ seasonably dressed in calzoni, or short, loose-fitting breeches. Another patron, disgusted by artists who seemed capable only of making pictures that were inducements to lust (cose lascive), asked Nunziata to paint him a Madonna who was honorable, visibly old, and not of the sort to incite impure thoughts. In response, Nunziata painted a Madonna with a beard—flouting his patron's excessive religious scruples with a satire that dangerously crossed the line of what many contemporaries would have considered blasphemous. These stories are tropes about the mischievous artist such as are found in Trecento writers, Sacchetti and Boccaccio. Paul Barolsky has dismissed them as invented. It is certainly true that the anecdote of the bearded Madonna, in particular, has much in common with a story told about the thirteenth-century painter Cimabue by Vasari's Florentine contemporary, Anton Francesco Grazzini, known as Il Lasca. By the mid-sixteenth century Cimabue had come to be popularly identified as a crude and inept painter, supposedly blind from birth or with such visual impairment that his eyes could be described as ‘lined with cloth’ (‘fodrati di panno’). In Lasca's Comento sopra il Capitolo della salciccia, the author relates that once when Cimabue painted Mary Magdalen in the desert, he decided to give her a beard in order to make her look particularly old and haggard. The unexpected result, however, was that Cimabue's Magdalen was mistaken by all who saw her for St. Onofrio, an ascetic saint usually clad in nothing other than his flowing beard. In Lasca's anecdote the painter's daring iconographic innovation, instead of shocking viewers as Nunziata's Madonna would have, simply leads them to an iconographic misstep—“rectifying” the anomalous iconography of the Magdalen as bearded old hag by confusing it with the quite canonical iconography of a male hermit saint. Lasca follows his story about Cimabue with another humorous anecdote about Nunziata, which has been completely overlooked in the literature on the painter. After describing Cimabue's bizarre image, he continues: > Il simigliante fece ancora il Nuntiata, perciò che, havendo fatto un Tubbia, > in scambio del pesce li dipinse in mano un catellino francesco. Instead of carrying the fish whose entrails would heal his father, Tobias in Nunziata's painting carried a little French dog of a type that had been fashionable in Florence since the fourteenth century! In Lasca's anecdote, unlike Vasari's, the joke does not hinge on Sacchetti-like mockery of an ignorant layman; the point of the story is the artist's playfulness, embracing the absurd by dreaming up unexpected juxtapositions of iconographic elements. Painted by Ghirlandaio? A record of his physical appearance may have been left to us by his friend Ridolfo Ghirlandaio. According to the Lives, Ridolfo included a portrait of Nunziata among the supernumeraries in his altarpiece of Christ Carrying the Cross, which was painted for the church of S. Gallo outside the walls of Florence, possibly c. 1505-10. The work won Ridolfo great renown, Vasari continues, on account of the lifelike portraits it contained of three painters who were his friends: Poggino Poggini, Giovanni d’Anton Francesco Guidi (called Scheggia), and Nunziata. Most of the heads in the Christ Carrying the Cross are in fact stock types or borrowings from earlier works of art, such as the helmeted soldier at the center of the composition whose screaming face betrays the inspiration of Leonardo’s Battle of Anghiari. In stark contrast with this gallery of conventionalized characters are three extremely lifelike heads, which we can undoubtedly identify as the three portraits identified by Vasari: the soldier who shoulders his musket at the left side of the composition; the man helping Christ to bear the cross in the middle; and the stubbly gray-haired man, wearing a broad-brimmed rustic hat, entering the scene from the far right. All three have extremely particularized features, leaving little room for doubt that they were drawn from life. Vasari singles out the likeness of Nunziata for particular praise, calling it ‘una testa vivissima’. But, even positing that Vasari was correct in identifying the three individuals as Poggini, Scheggia, and Nunziata, there is no sure way to match the three painters with their individual likenesses. Death The date of Nunziata’s death, known to the nineteenth-century archivist Gaetano Milanesi (who did not cite a specific documentary source for his information), has now been confirmed by the record of his burial, which took place in Santa Trinita (the church of the parish in which he had been born) on 13 April 1525. The choice of the Vallombrosan convent church for the painter’s burial church was likely influenced by the fact that Nunziata had been a parishioner of S. Trinita from the time of his birth in that parish until the very end of his life. Family The Florentine baptismal records also make it possible to establish the correct birthdate of Nunziata’s son, the painter Toto del Nunziata, who was born on 8 January 1498 (modern style), as claimed by Milanesi, and not on 18 January 1499 as stated by Colnaghi and subsequent writers following him. A third child of Nunziata’s, a daughter named Lisabetta, was born on the feast of the santo patrono John the Baptist in 1499, while two other sons are mentioned as living in Nunziata’s house shortly after the painter’s death in 1525; but Toto is the only member of the family who is known to have continued in the professional footsteps of their father. The census of Florentine men available to bear arms, drawn up some in 1527, identifies Nunziata’s former home as less than a block away from Santa Trinita, in the via del Parione that runs along the church’s northern flank. Still living there at the time of the census were two other sons of Nunziata, whose identities have not emerged from the Florentine baptismal records, together with ‘un garzone e un factore’. Neither of those two sons can be identified with Toto del Nunziata, for it appears that Toto never came back to the house in via del Parione. Instead, after embarking for England together with Torrigiani around 1519, he remained on Albion’s shore until his death twenty-five years later. Known amongst the English as Anthony Toto--or by a myriad of anglicized variants such as Totto, or Tote, or Tottes—the expatriate painter prospered at the royal courts of Henry VIII and Edward VI, where he held the lucrative office of serjeant painter from 1544 until his death in 1554. Toto presented the English kings with several paintings as New Year’s gifts, but it appears from the documentary record that much of his activity in England consisted of heraldic and decorative painting of the sort familiar from his father’s practice. Still, if Henry and Edward underutilized Toto’s talents, they compensated him richly for them. When he died Toto left substantial property, including two cottages at Mitcham and the lease of the manor of Ravesbury. Compared to his father, who once had to struggle for a living by moonlighting as an artilleryman, Toto achieved a remarkable level of social and economic status.

In the nineteenth century Kansas was a significant grape-growing state. Its latitude, long, sunny growing season and soils ranging from limestone-laced to sandy, can provide favorable conditions for growing grapes if the suitable varieties are planted. History In the early to mid-nineteenth century, German immigrants established extensive plantings of grapes in neighboring Missouri along the Missouri River, developing a thriving grape and wine culture that spread west into Eastern Kansas. By the 1870s, Missouri and Kansas constituted one of the largest grape growing and winemaking regions in the U.S., with wineries established in Kansas as far west as Russell and as far east as Paola. However, the state was also home to Carrie Nation and the early temperance movement. Kansas was the first state in the union to pass statewide prohibition in 1881. A booth for the White Tail Run Winery at a farmers' market in Overland Park, Kansas. Vineyard owners did not give up their grapes easily however. As late as 1900, twenty years after prohibition in Kansas, “The Grape in Kansas” published by the state horticultural society documented thousands of acres still existing in Kansas, with detailed statistics regarding cultivars planted, growing techniques and annual yields. It was common knowledge, however, that most of the grapes produced were either used for bootleg winemaking in Kansas or sold across the state line to the thriving wine industry in Missouri. With the advent of national prohibition in 1920, the grape and wine industry in Kansas and Missouri was destroyed. Even after the repeal of prohibition, strong liquor laws in Kansas prevented the reemergence of the industry until the Kansas Farm Winery Statute was passed in 1985. Wine industry today As of 2010, there were 23 licensed wineries in Kansas, with many more in the planning stages. Many Kansas wines now routinely win national awards.

Vehicular access to the village is restricted to residents with a car permit; visitors must walk across the beach from Morfa Nefyn or across the Nefyn & District Golf Club golf course on top of the headland, past the Iron Age hill fort.  Port  Porthdinllaen was originally a fishing port, based around a natural harbour at the west end of a bay over a mile and a quarter (2 km) across, and with over of safe anchorage. The harbour is sheltered by a headland jutting out to the north from all but a north-easterly wind, and as the only such haven on the Llŷn Peninsula, it has been used for many centuries of trading, and as a place to run to for shelter in a storm.Rhiw.com - Porthdinllaen In May 1806, a parliamentary bill approved new buildings when it seemed that Porthdinllaen would be chosen as the port on the route to Ireland, rather than Holyhead, Anglesey. Porthdinllaen was almost as far west as Holyhead, but Holyhead was more accessible, due to Thomas Telford's road developments. Porthdinllaen Harbour Company was formed in 1808 in preparation, by the Jones Parry family of the Madryn estate (the company's assets included the village and the harbour), but the bill before Parliament to constitute Porthdinllaen as a harbour for Irish trade was rejected in 1810.Archives Network Wales - Porthdinllaen Pig farming was important to the economy of the Llŷn Peninsula, and Porthdinllaen was the main point of export to Liverpool. In 1830, the farmers and merchants asked the Madryn estate to build a bigger pier, but the estate refused. The first steamer, the \\"Vale of Clwyd\\", did not therefore enter service until 1832. Apart from goods intended for the local population and the farmers, Porthdinllaen imported large quantities of salt to create the Nefyn herring. Railway proposals After the failure of the proposal to create a point of embarkation to Ireland, various proposals were made to build railways to serve the harbour at Porthdinllaen. However, none was eventually constructed: *1830 - Samuel Holland, a slate quarry owner at Rhiw, joined Henry Archer, a businessman from Dublin, to promote the Ffestiniog Railway, incorporated by Act of Parliament on 23 May 1832 *1845 - The Worcester and Porth-Dynllaen Railway informed the Rev. T. Parry Jones Parry of an application to Parliament of a railway track from Worcester to Porthdinllaen *1845 - The North Wales Railway Co. planned to construct of track from Bangor to Porthdinllaen *1860 - The Aberystwith and Welsh Coast Railway Company wanted to construct a line from Aberystwyth to Porthdinllaen. The line to Pwllheli was completed c.1876 but the final five miles were not built. *1877 - The Cambrian Railways Act revived the powers conferred by the Aberystwyth and Welsh Coast Railway Act 1862 for the final 5 miles from Pwllheli Lifeboat station In the 19th century, north Wales lacked good roads, and so the sea was the easiest way to access many places. Porthdinllaen, on the northern coast of the Llŷn peninsula, with its sheltered north facing bay, became important as a harbour of refuge and a busy port, with over 700 ships passing through the port in 1861. After storms in 1863, the local parish priest wrote to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution to request that a lifeboat be positioned in the harbour. The boat shed and slip were commissioned in 1864. Manned constantly since, the current coxswain is Mike Davies, who has served as coxswain since 2004.

Leaving Mrs.Elizabeth Beaver as the current leader after Beaver's death in 1992 CONN 390: Black Business Leadership, University of Puget Sound. Accessed online 3 December 2009. The Facts is a member of the West Coast Black Publishers Association and bills itself as the \\"Voice of the Black Community.\\" Background \\"The Facts\\" was the first African-American oriented newspaper in Seattle and is now only one of three African-American oriented newspapers in the area. The newspaper distributes around 80,000 copies currently in Seattle and surrounding area, the paper earns about $500,000 a year. The Facts started with a measly 5,000 newspapers in circulation. The Puget Sound region's black newspapers are bucking a national trend of fast-slipping circulation. \\"The Facts\\" founder Fitz Redd Beaver originally started the paper because he was looking for a source of income after losing his previous job. The main emphasis of \\"The Facts\\" is to primarily develop a perspective that can be interpreted by a mass audience. Fitz Redd Beaver examined the possibility of making a difference in his particular community to identify how data and information can be delivered. This viewpoint allowed an audience to develop an inherent eye on how information in the North West, specifically Seattle could be identified. The goal of The Facts was to pick up stories that are oriented towards the African-American population in Seattle. The Facts also hired many black journalists who later left the paper to create other newspapers such as The Medium, The Skanner and more in and around the northwest region. Competition There are currently three African-American oriented newspapers in the Seattle area: The Seattle Medium, The Skanner, and The Facts. There is much debate if the African-American population in Seattle is large enough to support three newspapers. Fitzgerald Redd Beaver the founder of “The Facts” assisted his biggest competitors Chris Bennett and Ernie Foster in opening their own African American oriented newspapers. Redd Beaver later distinguished his paper from his competitors by adding a distinctive pink color to his newspaper. Given the African-American population is 52,000. Both The Skanner and The Facts are free gaining their revenue from ads. The Seattle Medium is relatively low in cost at 25 cents a paper. The founder of \\"The Facts\\" newspaper: Fitzgerald Beaver. Founder Fitzgerald Redd Beaver (1922-1992) was born January 18, 1922 in Martinsville, Virginia. Beaver graduated high school in his home town of Martinsville, Virginia. He then went on to enroll and attend at North Carolina A&T; College, but dropped out before graduating. Fitz had several jobs before coming to the Northwest including: a civilian employee for the U.S Army, a railroad porter, and working at a radio station. His career at the radio station sparked his passion, spending the rest of his life in public relations and journalism. Quite successful in his career on the radio he became known as “Eager Beaver” on his radio show. Taking this fame he moved to manage a black owned radio station in the Northwest. Staying a short while, then founded “The Facts”. Fitz continued to better his community throughout his life as the president of the Boys and Girls Club, creating a primarily African American golf club, and worked with the government on minority recruitings.  Relation to Community Involvement Commission  \\"The Facts\\" is an avenue in which information can be illustrated, however, the Community Involvement Commission is a designed platform for sources to provide immediate services. The main focus for the commission is as Seattle becomes more developed, the city needs to expand their public discourse and ensure that specific demographic groups are represented in the City's council. As well as that any barriers that restrict individuals from involvement are immediately disrupted or eliminated. \\"The Facts\\" is an option for those in the City of Seattle to investigate how changes can be performed, meanwhile, highlight necessary needs that need to be addressed or investigated further. In relation to how \\"The Facts\\" corresponds with the principles of the Community Involvement Commission is rather implicit. \\"The Facts\\" is a newspaper that focuses on the African-American demographic and how this specific demographic can be an impact towards development in the City of Seattle.

He was twice Premier of the Republic of China and led his country's delegation at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. He sometimes used the French name René Lou in earlier life, and his monastic name was Pierre-Célestin, O.S.B..  Life  Lou was born on 12 June 1871 in Shanghai, Jiangsu, and was raised a Protestant in religion and a Confucianist in philosophy. His father, Lou Yong Fong, was lay catechist for a Protestant mission in Shanghai. He studied at home until the age of thirteen, when he entered the School of Foreign Language in Shanghai, specializing in French. He continued his education at the school for interpreters attached to the Foreign Ministry, and in 1893 he was posted to St Petersburg as interpreter (fourth-class) to the Chinese embassy. At that time the diplomatic international language was French, but Lou also gained fluency in Russian. The ambassador, the reform-minded Xu Jingcheng, took an interest in his career. Lou married a Belgian citizen, Berthe Bovy, in St Petersburg on 12 February 1899, and eventually converted to Roman Catholicism. The couple had no children.  Diplomatic career  His early years were marked by the Boxer Rebellion, during which his mentor, Xu Jingcheng, was beheaded in Beijing. Lou served the Qing regime as Chinese delegate at the first and second Peace Conferences in The Hague (1899 and 1907), as Minister to Belgium, and as Ambassador to Russia, but he never forgot the imperial government's betrayal of his \\"second father\\". When the 1911 Revolution broke out he was Ambassador in St Petersburg, and he took it upon himself, against the advice of his colleagues at other European capitals, to cable Beijing that there could be no hope of assistance from the Great Powers.  Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of China  At the proclamation of the Chinese Republic in 1912, he joined the Party of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, and served as Foreign Minister in the provisional government under President Yuan Shikai, March 1912 – September 1912. In August–September 1912 he also served as Prime Minister, but his lack of political leverage forced his resignation, ostensibly for health reasons. He returned to the cabinet as Foreign Minister from November 1912 to September 1913, and reformed the Foreign Ministry: abolishing the complicated bureaucracy of the imperial commissions, requiring knowledge of foreign languages at all levels, and instituting modern civil service examinations for recruits. He managed to avoid being identified with any particular faction within the new government, but this relative political isolation meant that he was little able to influence policy, and he again resigned. On leaving office he became one of the founders of the Chinese Society of International Law. From 27 January 1915 to 17 May 1916 he served as Minister of Foreign Affairs for a third time, in the \\"northern\\" government in Beijing which enjoyed international recognition, undertaking difficult negotiations with Japan and Russia. He became Foreign Minister for the fourth time on 30 November 1917.Announced on 2 December. See He served until 13 August 1920, with deputy minister Chen Lu becoming acting minister during his absence for the peace talks in Paris (November 1918 to December 1919). Paris Peace Conference Lou personally headed the Chinese delegation to the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. Article 156 of the envisioned Versailles Treaty transferred the German treaty territory in Shandong to Japan rather than recognise the sovereign authority of China. On 6 May, with the Japanese delegation insisting that they would only continue to support the conference's aims if Germany's colonial rights in China were transferred to Japan, Lou read the following declaration to the assembled delegates: > The Chinese delegation beg to express their deep disappointment at the > settlement proposed by the Council of the Prime Ministers. They also feel > certain that this disappointment will be shared in all its intensity by the > Chinese nation. The proposed settlement appears to have been made without > giving due regard to the consideration of right, justice and the national > security of China – consideration which the Chinese delegation emphasized > again and again in their hearings before the Council of the Prime Ministers > against the proposed settlement, in the hope of having it revised, and if > such revision cannot be had, they deem it their duty to make a reservation > on the said clauses now. When it transpired that the Great Powers would not countenance a signature with express reservations against any article, Lou ultimately refused to sign at all. This made China the only participating country not to sign the Versailles Treaty.  Benedictine monk and priest in Belgium  From 1922 to 1927 Lou was China's envoy to the League of Nations in Geneva. At the death of his wife he retired from an active life, and in 1927 became a postulant, under the name Dom Pierre-Célestin, in the Benedictine monastery of Sint-Andries in Bruges, Belgium. He was ordained priest in 1935. During the Second World War he gave lectures about the Far East in which he propagandized for the Chinese war effort against Japan; German security agents noted the names of those attending but took no further action. left In August 1946 Pope Pius XII appointed Lou titular abbot of the Abbey of St Peter in Ghent. In his final years he hoped to return to China as a missionary, to fulfill the instructions Xu Jingcheng had given him at the beginning of his career: > Europe's strength is found not in her armaments, nor in her knowledge — it > is found in her religion [...]. Observe the Christian faith. When you have > grasped its heart and its strength, take them and give them to China. His planned departure was postponed during the Chinese Civil War, and Dom Lou died in Bruges, Belgium on 15 January 1949.  Publications  His best known work, published in 1945, is an autobiography in French, Souvenirs et pensées, summarizing his diplomatic and political career and his subsequent religious vocation, in which Christianity appears as a completion of the Confucian tradition of \\"pacifying the universe\\". The work was translated into English by Michael Derrick as Ways of Confucius and of Christ (London, 1948), and into Dutch by Frans Van Oldenburg-Ermke, under the title Mijn roeping: herinneringen en gedachten (Bruges, n.d. [1946]). His other writings and published addresses include: *La Vie et les oeuvres du grand chrétien chinois Paul Siu Koang-k’i. Lophem-lez-Bruges: Abbaye de Saint-André, 1934.

The .327 has also been used in full-sized revolvers with a capacity of seven rounds or more. Development Introduced by Federal Cartridge company, the .327 Federal Magnum is an attempt to improve on the .32 H&R; Magnum introduced in 1984. Like the .32 H&R;, the .327 Federal is a lengthened version of the original .32 S&W; cartridge, which dates back to 1878. In 1896, the .32 S&W; Long was introduced, which generated slightly higher velocities. The introduction of the .32 H&R; increased pressures from 15,000 psi to 21,000 CUP, giving velocities of approximately . Based on the .32 H&R; Magnum, with a 1/8\\" longer case, strengthened web at the base of the case, thicker case walls, and different heat-treatment and metallurgy, the .327 Federal can be loaded to much higher pressure levels () than its predecessor (21,000 CUP).Pearce, Lane, Reloading the .327 Federal Magnum, Shooting Times Magazine, 4 January 2011 The .327's actual bullet diameter is and achieves muzzle velocities up to with bullets, and up to with bullets, when fired from the 3 1/16\\" (78 mm)-barreled Ruger SP101 revolver.Ballistics By The Inch .327magnum results. With its strengthened case and increased pressure ceiling, the .327 Federal reaches the velocity levels of the .357 Magnum, if not the same power. Since the .327 still shares all case dimensions, excluding length, with the .32 S&W; (Short), .32 S&W; Long, and .32 H&R; Magnum, revolvers chambered for the .327 Federal can also safely chamber and fire these shorter cartridges. While felt recoil exceeds that of the .32 H&R;, revolvers in .327 Federal are much easier to control than equivalent models chambered in .357 Magnum. Comparing the two calibers, Chuck Hawks says, \\"There is no doubt that, for most shooters, the .357 Mag. produces uncomfortable recoil and muzzle blast.\\" The .327's recoil energy is for an jacketed hollowpoint (JHP) load, for the JHP, and for the softpoint (SP). For comparison, the figures are for an .32 H&R; Magnum load and for a .357 Magnum load. Firearms chambered for the .327 Federal Magnum Revolvers in .327 Federal Magnum were initially offered by Charter Arms, Taurus, Ruger, and Freedom Arms. The stainless steel Ruger SP101 was originally selected as the development platform for the new cartridge. Freedom Arms made a single-action design, as did U.S. Fire Arms with its 8-shot Sparrowhawk. Ruger offered the double-action 6-shot SP101 and 7-shot GP100, and the full-sized single-action 8-shot Blackhawk, revolvers chambered in .327 Federal Magnum. A version of the Ruger SP101 with a 3 1/16\\" barrel chambered in the .327 Federal Magnum was released in January 2008. Ruger, U.S. Firearms, and Freedom Arms discontinued these models by the end of 2013. Smith & Wesson's Model 632 has also been discontinued. In late 2014, Ruger introduced the smaller-framed Ruger Single- Seven, a 7-shot single-action .327 Federal Magnum revolver based on the Single-Six.Sturm, Ruger & Co. Inc. In March, 2015, Ruger re-introduced the SP101 in .327 Federal Magnum. The current version of the SP101 features fully adjustable sights and a longer 4.2\\" (107mm) barrel. In September 2015, Ruger also introduced the LCR in .327 Federal Magnum, a double-action only, six-shot revolver with a polymer subframe. Ruger also offers the similar LCRx with an exposed hammer in this chambering. In early 2017, Henry Repeating Arms announced production of four new lever-action long guns (a rifle and a carbine, each available with its receiver manufactured from either steel or hardened brass), with shipping scheduled to begin in March.\\"New for 2017,\\" www.henryusa.com Firearms author Chuck Hawks suggests that lever-action carbines in .327 Mag. will make \\"excellent, fun to shoot centerfire rifles for hunting javelina, jackrabbit, and coyote\\"; he also notes that revolvers with 6\\" to 8\\" barrels and adjustable sights \\"would be excellent hunting handguns for varmints and small predators, as well as offering flat shooting protection from two-legged predators in the field.\\" Similar cartridges The .327 Federal Magnum provides performance similar to the high-velocity rifle loadings of the old .32-20 Winchester, though these velocities are achieved in a much shorter revolver barrel, thanks to a much higher pressure ceiling for the .327. Another similar cartridge is the .30 Carbine, which has been offered in Ruger's single-action Blackhawk revolver line since 1968. However, the .327 Federal Magnum has a higher maximum pressure ceiling (45,000 psi) than the .30 Carbine (40,000 psi). Custom gunsmiths working with Ruger and Freedom Arms have offered conversions of single-action .32 H&R; Single Six and Freedom Arms revolvers to .327 Federal. Test results from the long barreled guns showed even higher velocities than the .30 Carbine, along with excellent accuracy. Reception In the April 2008 issue of the NRA's American Rifleman magazine, Field Editor Bryce Towsley summed up his review of the cartridge as follows: The cartridge ultimately won the NRA Publications's prestigious Golden Bullseye Award for \\"Ammo of the Year\\" (2009). In April 2008, Guns & Ammo magazine's Patrick Sweeney reviewed the Ruger SP101 in .327 Federal Magnum and had this to say: Sweeney continues: Shooting Times magazine's Dick Metcalf had this to say about the .327 Mag. in the Ruger SP101 revolver (weight: ): In the Jan–Feb 2009 issue of American Handgunner magazine, John Taffin reviewed the .327 Federal Magnum in a Charter Arms Patriot revolver (6-shot, 2.2\\" barrel): See also *List of handgun cartridges *Table of handgun and rifle cartridges *8 mm caliber *Super magnum References External links * Ruger Blackhawk .327 Federal 5.5\\" 8-shot Revolver *Ballistics By The Inch .327 Federal Magnum Results.

Its purpose is to become a member of the worldwide coffee restaurant business, and promote Colombian coffee. It was created by Colombia's National Federation of Coffee Growers through Procafecol S.A.; the latter being a company established in 2002. It was named after Juan Valdez, Colombia's longtime coffee icon and a household name in the United States. History Juan Valdez Café coffeehouse in Bogotá, Colombia The founding of Juan Valdez Café fulfilled the aspirations of Colombian coffee makers, who for decades advocated for the creation of a national brand. During the 1960s and 1970s, the Colombian Coffee Federation opened some outlets in Argentina and Spain, but those were closed before 1985. However, as early as 2000, the situation was different: market prices for green coffee beans were low, and coffee had become popular everywhere, allowing for the rapid growth of coffeehouses. This opportunity was seized by Colombia's Federación Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia in September 2002, when they established Juan Valdez Café as their official coffeehouse brand. The first location was opened in Bogotá, followed in Medellín and Cali, and later in other cities. The first international location was opened in the United States, and the company is currently in expansion. Actor playing Juan Valdez The National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia established the Juan Valdez cafés as part of a marketing campaign to promote fair trade coffee. Consumers automatically support the farmers when they patronize the store. In Colombia, the coffee industry accounts for over 8% of the GDP, employing directly and indirectly more than a million people and farms spanning over half the number of towns in the whole country. The federation, established in 1927, is owned and controlled by 500,000 farmers who grow their coffee on small farms, as opposed to plantations. The issue of fair prices for coffee farmers became even more important in 2000 when coffee prices steadily dropped from $1.30 a pound in January to 75 cents a pound by December because of increased production, according to the International Coffee Organization. Since 1960, the federation has spent $600 million building the Juan Valdez brand. However, its advertising campaign went dark in 2001 as coffee prices hit all-time lows. The federation plans to spend $75 million in the next five years to reposition itself as an upscale specialty-coffee region with a diverse line of coffee. Juan Valdez is the only international coffeehouse authorized to officially sell Colombian coffee. In September 2007 it was given protected designation of origin granted by the European Union after an international dispute won by the Colombian National Federation of Coffee Growers on intellectual property, and the lawsuit brought against a Costa Rica-based company using the Juan Valdez slogan (Juan Valdez drinks Costa Rican coffee). Store locations As of 2014, Juan Valdez has 300 company-owned, joint-venture and licensed outlets in the world. International expansion, which began in 2005, brought new locations to Aruba, Guayaquil, La Paz, Madrid, Miami, New York City, San José, Costa Rica, Panama City, Lima, Quito, Santiago and Washington D.C.. Despite recent closures in the United States and Spain, the company aims to continue its expansion worldwide through a franchising scheme. The company has plans to keep expanding in Ecuador, Chile, San José, Costa Rica, Panama and the United States, as well as opening in new markets such as Mexico, Peru, Venezuela and the Middle East. However, the chain is still underrepresented in many countries compared to other world wide coffee chains. In June 2017, Juan Valdez Cafe franchise opened its store in Cooper City.

The group was assigned to the 2nd Combat Bombardment Wing, and the group tail code was a \\"Circle-J\\". The 453rd BG entered combat on 5 February 1944 with an attack against an airfield at Tours. Throughout combat, the unit served chiefly as a strategic bombardment organization. Targets included a fuel depot at Dülmen, marshalling yards at Paderborn, aircraft assembly plants at Gotha, railway centres at Hamm, an ordnance depot at Glinde, oil refineries at Gelsenkirchen, chemical works at Leverkusen, an airfield at Neumünster, a canal at Minden, and a railway viaduct at Altenbeken. The group took part in the concentrated attack against the German aircraft industry during Big Week, 20–25 February 1944. Besides strategic operations, the group engaged in support and interdictory missions. Bombed V-weapon sites, airfields, and gun batteries in France prior to the invasion of Normandy in June 1944; on 6 June hit shore installations between Le Havre and Cherbourg and other enemy positions farther inland. Attacked enemy troops in support of the Allied breakthrough at Saint-Lô in July. Bombed German communications during the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944 – January 1945. Ferried cargo on two occasions: hauled gasoline, blankets, and rations to France in September 1944; dropped ammunition, focal, and medical supplies near Wesel during the airborne assault across the Rhine in March 1945. James \\"Jimmy\\" Stewart, right, 1943 James \\"Jimmy\\" Stewart, the Hollywood movie star, was Group Operations Officer at Old Buckenham during the spring of 1944. The actor Walter Matthau also served in the group as a radioman-gunner, rising to the rank of Staff Sergeant. The 453rd Bomb Group flew its last combat mission in April. Initially it was prepared for possible redeployment to the Pacific theatre using B-29 Superfortresses. However hostilities in the Pacific had ceased before the group had time to start its movement. It returned to New Castle AAFld, Delaware on 9 May 1945 and was inactivated on 12 September 1945. 453rd Bomb Group Museum In February 2015, it was announced that Old Buckenham Airport the modern civilian name for RAF Old Buckenham has applied for permission to build a museum dedicated to the 453rd at their former base in England. The plans are for the erection of two Nissen Huts, one of which will house an items described as having the potential to be the largest collection of 453rd Bomb Group memorabilia in existence.

Offices At its height in 2008, COHRE maintained offices in Switzerland, Ghana, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Brazil and the United States and carried out work through three Regional Programmes covering Africa, Asia and the Americas as well as five Thematice Programmes covering economic, social and cultural rights strategic litigation; women and housing rights; forced evictions; housing and land restitution; and the rights to water and sanitation. As of the end of 2011, COHRE maintained registered offices in the Asia-Pacific region (Cambodia) and Africa (Kenya). These remaining offices coordinated regional and local activities in pursuit of COHRE’s mission. COHRE’s mission is to ensure the full enjoyment of the human right to adequate housing for everyone, everywhere, including preventing forced evictions of persons, families and communities from their homes or lands. COHRE ceased operations in early 2012. COHRE had been granted Special Consultative Status by the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC, 1999), and the Organisation of American States (OAS, 2002), and had participatory status with the Council of Europe (CoE, 2003) as well as Observer Status with the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (ACHRP, 2003). Programmes Through three regional programmes covering Africa, Asia-Pacific and the Americas, COHRE had joined forces with partners non-governmental organisations (NGOs), communities and committed professionals, in pursuit of the goal of housing rights for everyone, everywhere. During more than a decade of promoting housing rights throughout the world, COHRE learnt that there is no single methodology that can address the wide range of processes undermining the right to adequate housing. This is because the problem of housing rights is simply too pervasive, the causes too diverse, for blueprint responses or methodologies to be effective. For example, a particular housing rights violation, such as a mass forced eviction, could be the result of a locally administered development project that has been initiated by the national government, in the context of an externally enforced financial restructuring programme, and funded by international donor organisations. It could be caused by a combination of rapid urbanisation, pervasive tenure insecurity, and political conflict. It might be the consequence of inadequate legal protection for the poor. Again, it might be the result of preparations to host a mega-event such as a world cup tournament or the Olympic Games. Tools COHRE developed and tested a range of tools, to be used in different combinations and at different levels, as each particular situation demands. These include: Partnerships and joint strategies COHRE’s work was based on the assumption that the role of the affected communities is of crucial importance in addressing housing rights violations. The poor themselves should be directly involved in formulating and implementing solutions and alternatives. Communities have a vital contribution to make, without which most housing-related projects simply will not succeed. In housing rights or eviction cases where COHRE became directly involved, COHRE therefore strived to build alliances and partnerships and to embark on joint campaigns with groups and support organisations working at community level. Working at community level is often not sufficient in itself. As national, regional and international action can be very effective in cases of major housing rights violations, COHRE also formed partnerships with organisations working at these broader levels. Fact-finding investigations Another tool is the collection of relevant, accurate information. COHRE regularly sends multi-disciplinary fact-finding teams to key focus countries. They typically conduct in-loco investigations, conduct interviews with the main role players, study relevant laws, policies and programmes and do any additional research required for an assessment of the nature and scope of land and housing rights violations in a particular situation. This would provide the basis for drawing up recommendations and alternatives. These missions are usually conducted at the request of, and in collaboration with, local partners. COHRE used the draft fact-finding reports as tools for consultation and negotiations with key role-players, including governments. This strategy has proven effective in convincing government to grapple with the extent of the violations and the implications of proceeding with current policies and practice. Once finalised, COHRE fact-finding reports are used as information resources for local human rights organisations and the affected communities; for lobbying the relevant government to introduce new policies, laws and programmes. Fact-finding reports are also useful tools at regional and international level to place pressure on the relevant governments; and to form the basis of shadow reports for submission before UN human rights mechanisms and other regional and international bodies. Advocacy COHRE supported local groups and support organisations to mobilise and campaign against housing rights violations by issuing formal letters of protest to governments, presenting submissions to government missions, launching joint action campaigns, and exerting public pressure through media exposure. In cases of extreme and sustained violations, without any attempt by the governments concerned to take remedial steps, COHRE would consider including the country concerned in the list of housing rights violators as part of its Housing Rights Violator, Protector and Defender Awards, announced at the end of every year until 2008. This tool had proven remarkably effective in naming and shaming perpetrators of the worst housing rights violations, while at the same time highlighting positive efforts by governments and individuals to promote and protect the housing rights of communities. Litigation In the past, COHRE undertook strategic litigation to enforce human rights standards, remedy past human rights violations and generate beneficial jurisprudence in the area of economic, social and cultural rights. COHRE's work in this area included legal advice for test cases at the domestic level, taking cases before international and regional judicial forums in the event that domestic courts fail to provide an adequate remedy, and capacity-building training and workshops for judges, lawyers and other human rights advocates. In 2009, COHRE lead two cases before the European Committee of Social Rights: No. 52/2008 against Croatia and No. 58/2009 against Italy.Council of Europe The strategic litigation work that COHRE once undertook was continued by the Global Initiative for Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Regional and International Bodies Action at regional and international levels is an important tool to support national struggles addressing housing rights violations. In many instances, decisions issued at the United Nations level or by regional human rights mechanisms play an important role in changing a government policy or legislation, while also providing crucial support to groups and communities fighting forced evictions and other housing rights violations. With its International Secretariat in Geneva, COHRE regularly provides direct access to the United Nations for groups in the developing world to conduct specific advocacy and lobbying, get concrete decisions and recommendations helping them in their struggle, learn about the UN human rights machinery and get crucial contacts and supports for their case. COHRE also arranges petitions and presentations to regional bodies such as the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights. Training COHRE engaged in extensive training programmes with grassroots groups, NGOs, government officials, lawyers and judges. Training programmes are tailored to meet the needs of a particular target group and context. Community groups and support organisations were assisted to understand their rights and to develop strategies to realise those rights, participation in housing rights movements and the formulation of alternatives. Lawyers were trained to be more sensitive to the needs and the role of communities, and to incorporate international legal protections into their arguments. Government officials were introduced to the concept of housing as a human right, the importance of allowing affected communities to participate directly in their programmes, and lessons from international best practice. Judges were introduced to the provisions and importance of international law. The different groups were also brought together to exchange ideas and to develop joint strategies. Promoting policy and legislative reform COHRE promotes policy and legislative reform at national, regional and international level, to ensure that housing rights and delivery frameworks and legal instruments are improved where it is possible.

The NCAAA is the largest independent black cultural arts institution in New England, United States. History and Founding The museum subsumed Lewis' previously launched Elma Lewis School of Fine Arts. Since 1950, the Elma Lewis School of Fine Arts has served Boston citizens of all ages. Its alumni have distinguished themselves in the performing arts internationally. In the 1990s, the NCAAA completely renovated and expanded the 34,000 square foot building with its studios, auditorium, cafeteria, offices and classrooms. The school continued to serve as an educational and cultural center, it has been a hub of forums, receptions and civil programs of community interests. The NCAAA's strategic plan for its facilities offers a unique opportunity to strengthen black culture by strengthening its institutional base. This has not only benefited black people, it has benefited Boston, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the nation. Miss Elma Lewis worked tirelessly to make the center a reality. She believed that \\"one must know one's past, because without a past there is no future.\\" At its founding, the NCAAA was housed in a former firehouse in Franklin Park, Boston. The museum was moved to a separate building in 1980 and is now located at the Museum of the National Center of Afro-American Artists. Two fires in the early 1980s significantly damaged the firehouse, where the NCAAA was housed, although collections stored at the museum, which had its own facility, were unharmed. Harriet Forte Kennedy served as the assistant director of the museum for some time. Activities Activities of the NCAAA have included: * Establishment and maintenance of a museum; * Hosting arts performances (\\"Black Musical Productions\\" and others) and exhibitions, individually and in collaboration with other fine arts museums in Boston; * Offering arts education programs to a variety of students (professional, community primary students, and local prisoners).

Many of these wines are grown from traditional European wine grapes of the Vitis vinifera group such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Pinot noir, and Riesling but Arkansas also makes wine from its native grapes, the Cynthiana and Muscadine. History Winemaking in Arkansas dates back to the first French Catholic settlers, and commercial winemaking started in the 1870s with German and Swiss settlers who came to Altus, Arkansas and found the climate favorable to growing grapes. One of these settlers was Jacob Post, who emigrated to the area in 1872 and his descendants are sixth generation winemakers.Eley, Ashton. \\"The Rich History and Future Opportunity of Arkansas Wine.\\" The Idle Class, Spring 2017. 36-37.

The rules of this program are administered by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), who is responsible for the oversight of all transportation security, including truck, rail and ocean, as well as air. While the specifics of the security program are restricted, the multi-layered program effectively eliminates the anonymous shipment of all documents, parcels, counter-to-counter packages and freight on both passenger and cargo-only flights originating within the U.S. Such anonymous shipments were frequent in the years prior to 2001 and led to growing concern in Congress and amongst the general public about the overall security of air travel. In the post-September 11th era, shippers who have been properly vetted with the TSA by an air carrier or freight forwarder are considered a Known Shipper with the TSA.

Built around 1912, it served the growing Chinese population centered in Lahaina, primarily those working in the sugarcane industry as a social and fraternal hall for the Wo Hing Society. By the 1940s the declining Chinese population in Lahaina slowly made the building redundant and the property was neglected. In 1983, the Lahaina Restoration Foundation worked with the Wo Hing Society to restore the building to its former appearance. After restoration and construction in 1984, the museum was opened to the public. It currently operates under the name Wo Hing Museum and is one of only two existing Chinese Society Halls on Maui. It was placed on the Hawaii State Register of Historic Places on July 30, 1982, and, as Wo Hing Society Building, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 15, 1982. History In 1852, many Chinese were brought to work on Hawaii's sugarcane plantations, mainly single men. When their contracts expired, some stayed behind and took up other trades.Maui Remembers pg. 49Wo Hing Museum pamphlet given out by the Lahaina Restoration Foundation Due to the influx and distance from mainland China, Chinese Tong societies sprouted up to provide Chinese religious and political help, in addition to mutual aid, friendship, and funerary benefits upon death.Exploring Historic Lahaina pg. 61Experience Historic Maui Brochure. Produced by County of Maui, Maui Cultural Resources Commission, and the Department of Planning. 4th Printing 4/98 Sometime around 1909, the Chinese in Lahaina formed the Wo Hing Society, an offshoot of the Chee Kung Tong. Using private donations and funds, in 1912, the Wo Hing Society Hall was erected. By the 1940s, many of the Chinese in Lahaina pursued new business opportunities in Honolulu. This led to the property being left derelict and prey to termites and rot. In 1983, the Lahaina Restoration Foundation approached the Wo Hing Society and entered into a long-term agreement to help restore the building and open it to the public. Restoration was completed in 1984, and is open to the public.Wo Hing Museum Plaque outside of the museum It is considered to be one of the finest surviving Chinese Tong Society Halls in the State of Hawaii. Buildings The site is split up into a main building with two floors and a cookhouse to the side. The first floor of the main building houses a collection of Chinese artifacts and memorabilia of Lahaina around the start of the 20th century. Most cover the years after sugarcane established itself on the west side of Maui. The second floor features the only public Taoist altar on Maui. Altars to Guan Ti and other Chinese deities are on the floor, with a selection of other Chinese artifacts. The cookhouse was a separate structure, created as a precaution to prevent the risk of fire damage to the main Wo Hing Temple. Today, along with displaying numerous cooking artifacts, it was converted into a mini theater. One highlight is the showing of films of Hawaii taken by Thomas Edison in 1898 and 1906. Etymology and culture Wo Hing literally means \\"harmony and prosperity\\" (Wo = Peace and Harmony, Hing = Prosperity) This is reflected in calligraphy boards around the temple. The temple also utilizes Feng Shui principles, with the entrance (or front) of the building facing the ocean, and its back to the mountains.

The target is flanked by non-target stimuli which correspond either to the same directional response as the target (congruent flankers), to the opposite response (incongruent flankers), or to neither (neutral flankers). The task is named for American psychologists Barbara. A. Eriksen & Charles W. Eriksen, who first published the task in 1974, and for the flanker stimuli that surround the target. In the tests, a directional response (usually left or right) is assigned to a central target stimulus. Various forms of the task are used to measure information processing and selective attention. Procedure and method In an Eriksen Flanker Task there are three types of stimuli used: Incongruent, congruent, and neutral stimuli represented by arrows. This is what a participant may see in a standard Eriksen Flanker Task #Congruent stimulus- Flankers call for the same response as the target, and may appear identical. Also referred to as the compatible condition. #Incongruent stimulus- Flanker items call for the opposite response of the target and are represented by different symbols. Also referred to as the incompatible condition. #Neutral stimulus- Flanker items neither call for the same response nor evoke response conflict. In the original test described by Eriksen and Eriksen in 1974, letter stimuli were used. Subjects were instructed to make directional responses to certain letters, for example a right response could be associated to the letters H and K, and a left response to S and C. Each stimulus consisted of a set of seven letters, with the target stimulus placed in the central position. Examples of congruent stimuli would be HHHKHHH and CCCSCCC, where both the target stimulus and the flankers correspond to the same directional response. Examples of incongruent stimuli could be HHHSHHH and CCCHCCC , where the central target letter and the flankers correspond to opposite directional responses. Choice reaction times (CRTs or RTs) were then recorded and compared between congruent and incongruent conditions. Other variants of the Eriksen Flanker Task have used numbers, color patches, or arrows as stimuli. Also, although most Eriksen Flanker Tasks show the flankers on the left and right of the target, they can also be placed above or below the target, or in other spatial orientations. These examples all use an arbitrary mapping between the stimulus and the response. Another possibility is to use a natural mapping, with arrows as stimuli. For example, Kopp et al. (1994) used left and right arrows, with flanker stimuli above and below the target. The flankers could be arrows pointing in the same direction as the target (congruent) the opposite direction (incongruent) or squares (neutral). More commonly, flankers have been arranged in a horizontal array, as with letter stimuli, so <<<<< would be a congruent stimulus, <<><< an incongruent stimulus. Neurological basis The Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) is highlighted in yellow When subjects participate in the Eriksen Flanker Task, the anterior cingulate cortex, or the ACC, is activated. The ACC is a frontal brain structure responsible for a wide variety of autonomic functions. It is observed to be more active in response to processing incongruent stimuli than congruent stimuli. It is believed that the ACC may monitor the amount of conflict in an Eriksen Flanker trial. Then, that measured conflict is used to enhance the amount of control the participant has on the next trial. Thus indicating that the more conflict presented on trial n, the more control expressed on trial n + 1. This process leads to an interaction called the Gratton effect, which is the finding of a lower interference effect after an incongruent trial compared to the effect after a congruent trial. On this first trial (trial n) the incongruent stimulus presented will lead to an increase in conflict detected by the ACC. On trial n + 1, the increased conflict will lead to more control, causing the distracting, or flanker, stimuli to be more readily ignored. Experimental findings  The flanker paradigm was originally introduced as a way of studying the cognitive processes involved in detection and recognition of targets in the presence of distracting information, or \\"noise\\". The 1974 study found that CRT was significantly greater in incompatible than compatible conditions, a difference termed the flanker effect. Earlier work had used visual search, but because these tasks involve an active scan of the environment to identify the target stimulus, this experimental design made it difficult to separate the effects of distraction from the effects of the search process. In the flanker paradigm, the position of the target is always known—there is no search process. Nonetheless interference still occurs, so it can be studied independently of search mechanisms. Eriksen and Schultz (1979) varied a number of features of the flanker tests, for example the size and contrast of the letters, or the use of forward or backward masking. They proposed a continuous flow model of perception in which information is processed in parallel for different stimulus elements, and accumulates over time until sufficient information is available to determine a response. More recent work in this area has used neurophysiological measures such as event- related potentials or imaging techniques such as fMRI. Effects on performance A variety of factors have been shown to affect subject's performance on flanker tasks. Acute administration of antihistamine or alcohol severely impairs CRT in test measures, a deficit which Ramaekers et al. (1992) found to carry over to driving tests. The study used an on-the-road driving tests, and several laboratory tests including the letter version of the Eriksen task to assess the effects of two antihistamines and alcohol on driving skills. Both alcohol and the antihistamine cetirizine impaired performance in the test measures, and their effects were additive. The non- sedating antihistamine loratadine had no effect on any of the measures studied. The arrow version of the flanker test has also been evaluated as a method of detecting impairment due to alcohol and drugs in drivers at the roadside, demonstrating the importance of selective attention skills to spatial abilities such as vehicle operation. Various psychiatric and neurological conditions also affect performance on flanker tasks. While subjects with chronic schizophrenia performed similarly to control subjects on flanker tasks of both conditions, acute schizophrenics have a significantly greater RT with incongruent flanker conditions. This indicates the nature of cognitive dysfunction for the latter may involve broadening of selective attention. Studies involving sufferers of Parkinson's disease found similar difficulties with suppressing incorrect response activation due to flanker interference, especially when under speed stress. Moderate exercise, conversely, has been shown to improve performance on flanker tests, suggesting efficiency of cognitive control operates constructively with physical activity. Curiously, lowering serotonin levels via acute tryptophan depletion does not affect performance on a flanker task or corresponding EEG readings, but does alter cardiac response to incongruent stimuli, suggesting dissociation between cardiac and electro-cortical responses to errors and feedback when measuring cognitive flexibility. Effect of sequential testing The conflict effect of flanker interference have been well- documented to decrease with repeat testing, especially following incongruent/conflict conditions in what is known as the Gratton Effect. However the precise nature of these sequential dependencies is still subject to speculation; the effect may be stimulus-independent or stimulus-specific, and recent studies suggest the effect is not solely attributable to conflict adaptation but forms of associative priming. Still other research maintains the Gratton effect can be eliminated entirely if sequential biases are removed and that conflict adaptation failed to account for any performance results, suggesting instead support for a congruency switch cost model. The Gratton effect of conflict adaptation effect is also well documented in studies of event-related brain potentials (ERPs), which typically show reduced activity for high-conflict trials following other high-conflict trials. An advantage of using ERPs is the ability to examine subtle differences in brain activity that do not appear in behavioral measures, such as response times or error rates. Similar conflict tasks There are three different types of conflict tasks that research has been largely focused on, one of these being the Eriksen Flanker Task. All three of these tasks have mainly been viewed as identical in terms of the control processes that are involved. Due to this, inferences and predictions about one task have been made by theorists based on the published findings in a different task. Another conflict task that receives significant focus is the Stroop task. In this test, participants are told to name the color of a word as quickly as they can and as accurately as possible. The trick is the word itself refers to a color. The word can either be congruent, which would mean the word would match the font color, such as the word \\"blue\\" in blue font color, or it can be incongruent where the word would not match the font color like the word \\"purple\\" in yellow font color. Just as with the Eriksen Flanker Task, the response time and accuracy of congruent words is better than those of incongruent words. The third task that is largely focused on is the Simon or spatial compatibility task. In this task, the stimulus, either a word, letter, or symbol, is shown on the right or left side of the computer screen. The participant is instructed to press the right or left button based on the content of the stimulus rather than its location. A congruent trial, for example, could be the word \\"left\\" shown on the left side of the screen, while an incongruent trial might be the word \\"left\\" on the right side of the screen.

Their works are included in many major modern art collections, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Victoria & Albert Museum. Jaroslava Brychtová, a sculptor, and Stanislav Libenský, originally a painter and later a glass artist, met in 1954. They married in 1963 and worked together until Libenský's death on February 24, 2002. Libenský painted and sketched the designs, and Brychtová made clay sculptures from his designs. Since Libenský's death, Brychtová continued to produce castings. Their work is characterised by simple block shapes infused with subtle colours and nuances. Brychtová died on April 8, 2020, aged 95. Education and artistic partnership Red Pyramid Stanislav Libenský began his study of glass in 1937 at the Specialized School of Glassmaking in Nový Bor, Czechoslovakia, a region encompassing the Czech- German border called the Sudetenland. When the German army occupied the Sudetenland in 1938, Libenský moved first to the school at Železný Brod, and later to Prague Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design, known as VŠUP (an abbreviation of Vysoká škola uměleckoprůmyslová v Praze) from which he graduated in 1944. His first notable series in glass, created in Nový Bor between 1945 and 1948, were thin crystal vessels, delicately etched and enameled with themes from the Bible and Renaissance art.Klein, Dan, \\"Artists in Glass\\", Mitchell Beazley, an imprint of Octopus Publishing Group Ltd., Great Britain, 2001, p. 116 In 1948 Libenský returned to VŠUP, where he studied under Josef Kaplický, a painter, sculptor and architect who headed the school of painting on glass. Through his dynamic teaching style and modernist ideas, Kaplický had a tremendous influence on his students and thus on the independence of glass as an art form in Czechoslovakia. In 1953 Libenský returned to Železný Brod to become the director of the Specialized School of Glassmaking. It was during that time that he met Jaroslava Brychtová, the daughter of the school's co-founder, Jaroslav Brychta.Green, Peter S., \\"Stanislav Libenský, 80; Redefined Glass Art\\", The New York Times, March 2, 2002 Jaroslava Brychtová began to experiment with casting and carving glass in the late 1940s. She founded the Center for Architectural Glass at the Specialized School of Glassmaking in 1950. Like Libenský, Brychtová studied at VŠUP. The war interrupted her education, but she later finished her studies with a concentration in sculpture. Her teachers were Karel Štipl (from 1945 to 1951) and Jan Lauda (from 1947 to 1950).Libenský website.

Libenský was an excellent teacher who respected the tradition of glass in Czechoslovakia while furthering his own ideas about the modern direction of glass art. His career at the academy lasted nearly one- quarter of a century. During that time, despite the opposition of the Communist government that had taken hold of the country in the late 1940s, Libenský was able not only to influence two generations of glass artists through his teaching but also, through international lecturing and exhibition of his and Jaroslava Brychtová’s works, build international interest in modern Czech glass art. Notable students of Professor Libenský include František Janák, Marian Karel, Ivana Mašitová, Yan Zoritchak (Ján Zoričák),Petrová, Sylva, 2001, pp. 243, 245 and Alena Bílková. Architectural commissions Much of Libenský and Brychtová's architectural work was done for buildings in Czechoslovakia, including two windows, created for the St. Wenceslas Chapel in Prague's St. Vitus Cathedral. Built in the fourteenth century, the historic chapel was reconstructed by the Czech government between 1961 and 1964. Libenský and Brychtová were selected by competition to replace the chapel's original stained glass windows, which dated from 1912–13. The artists created an abstract design for the windows that, in its modern simplicity, departed from the ornate, early sixteenth-century decoration of the chapel. To relate the new to the old, Libenský and Brychtová used the muted grey-brown, grey- green and pink hues in the chapel's frescoes as the predominate colors in their windows.Petrova, 2001, p. 94 Outside of Czechoslovakia their architectural glass work was seen in World's Fair exhibitions and Czech Embassies.

History In 1979, a commission of inquiry known as the Cox Commission on the Constitution was constituted and charged with studying the feasibility of introducing a republican system. The Cox Commission came to the conclusion that Barbadians preferred to maintain the constitutional monarchy. The proposal to move to a republican status was therefore not pursued. The 1994 manifesto of the Barbados Labour Party dealt with the republic issue, proposing a referendum. In line with this promise, on 29 October 1996 a Constitution Review Commission, chaired by Henry de Boulay Forde, was appointed to review the Constitution of Barbados. The Commission elected Oliver Jackman, a former diplomat and a judge of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights as its Vice Chairman. The Commission was mandated to: :1. “determine the necessity for retaining the Monarchical System of Government and make recommendations in respect of the Executive form of Government most suited to protect parliamentary democracy, the fundamental rights and freedoms of the citizens of Barbados and to achieve effective and efficient Government so as to position Barbados to meet the challenges of the 21st century and beyond. :2. To advise and make recommendations concerning the appropriateness or otherwise of maintaining Barbados’ link with the Crown. :3. To advise and make recommendations concerning a structure for the Executive Authority of Barbados that is best suited to protect the Independence and Authority of Parliament and the fundamental rights and freedoms of its citizens.” The Commission held public hearings in Barbados and overseas. The Commission reported back on 15 December 1998, and submitted its report to the Governor-General of Barbados. The Commission recommended that Barbados adopt a Parliamentary republic system. In 1999 the Barbados Labour Party's Manifesto proposed that the findings of the Commission and its recommendation that Barbados become a republic would receive the early attention of the Government. A Referendum Bill was introduced in Parliament and had its first reading on 10 October 2000. With the dissolution of Parliament just prior to the elections in 2003, the Referendum Bill was not carried over. 2008 proposed referendum A referendum on Barbados becoming a republic was planned to be held in Barbados by August 2008, near to the time of the parliamentary elections. However, it was reported on December 2, 2007, that the vote was to be held at a later date instead. Question According to the Referendum Act 2005, the question to be asked is: > Do you agree with the recommendation of the Constitution Review Commission > that Barbados should become a Parliamentary republic with the head of State > of Barbados being a President who is a citizen of Barbados? Debate The Government of Barbados announced its intention to hold a referendum on the republic issue in February 2005. It introduced a Referendum Bill that month. The Bill was passed into law in October 2005. The Act did not set a date for the referendum, but instead specified that the \\"Referendum Day\\" could be proclaimed by the Governor-General, being no more than 90 days and no less than 60 days from the date of proclamation. The Act itself could not amend Barbados' constitution, because under section 49.1 a majority of two- thirds of Parliament is required to make any amendments. Mia Mottley, who was Deputy Prime Minister of Barbados, said: \\"we feel that it is the right thing to do to have a Barbadian head of state. We accept that there was a concern that the Government alone should not make that decision in this day and age and we are therefore committed to expressing our views to the public and having them pass judgement on it.\\" 2015 proposal On 22 March 2015, Prime Minister Freundel Stuart announced that Barbados will move towards a republican form of government \\"in the very near future\\". Stuart told a meeting of his Democratic Labour Party: \\"We cannot pat ourselves on the shoulder at having gone into independence; having de-colonised our politics; we cannot pat ourselves on the shoulders at having decolonized our jurisprudence by delinking from the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and explain to anybody why we continue to have a monarchical system. Therefore, the Right Excellent Errol Barrow decolonized the politics; Owen Arthur decolonized the jurisprudence and Freundel Stuart is going to complete the process.\\" The general secretary of the Democratic Labour Party, George Pilgrim, confirmed the move and said that it is expected to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Barbadian independence in 2016. According to Pilgrim, the change will be implemented through a bill that will be presented to the Parliament of Barbados. According to the country's Constitution, a two-thirds majority in Parliament is needed to authorize the change. The Democratic Labour Party has a two-thirds majority in the Senate of Barbados but not in the House of Assembly where it would need the support of the opposition Barbados Labour Party to approve the transition. 2020 proposal In September 2020, the Barbados Labour Party government of Prime Minister Mia Mottley announced in its Throne Speech that Barbados would become a republic by November 2021. The Barbados Labour Party holds a two-thirds majority in both houses of the Barbadian parliament (including all but one lower house seat), enough to approve a constitutional amendment.

The character was portrayed by actor Jo Weil from 31 December 1999 to 3 September 2002 and again since 2 November 2007.First/last appearance and date of return  Character's background  Oliver is the nephew of Charlie Schneider (Gabriele Metzger) and cousin of Olivia (Kristina Dörfer). His mother, Henriette is in bad terms with Charlie and has kept her away from Oliver during his childhood. It was mentioned once that he has a younger brother. Oliver is disowned by his mother when she discovers his relationship with another man, Tom Seifert (played by Kay Böger) and was supported by his aunt Charlie since. At the end of this relationship, he leaves Düsseldorf to work as a steward. Five years later, Oliver returns to the show, reuniting with Charlie and moving into a flat- share with Coco Faber (Mariangela Seclsi) and her boyfriend Christian Mann (Thore Schölermann). Due to problems in her relationship with Christian, Coco ends up kissing Oliver and develops feelings for him. However, after spending time with him on a camping trip, Oliver finds himself falling in love with Christian. Oliver goes on to find himself torn by his feelings for Christian, knowing he is straight and with a woman. After Christian discovers Coco and Oliver's kiss, an angry confrontation at the boxing club prompts Oliver to kiss him and finally confess his feelings. However, Christian rejects Oliver by claiming he is straight. Despite this, Christian becomes confused about his sexuality and breaks up with Coco, but isn't willing to admit he has developed feelings for Oliver too. Later, Oliver chats with a man who is confused about his sexuality, unaware that it's actually Christian. When the truth comes out, their confrontation leads to them having sex for the first time, but afterwards Christian claims that he was only testing his sexuality. However, when he sees Oliver dancing with another guy at a party, he can't hide his jealousy and admits his feelings for Oliver and they start a relationship. Oliver supports Christian's boxing aspirations, hiding their relationship from his manager and from the public despite Christian's regular claims that he just wants to come out loud and proud. But Oliver refuses to let him do so, aware of how the boxing world will see Christian as a gay and how coming out so soon will likely end his career as a boxer before it can even begin. He even endures regular harassment from Axel, a homophobic fighter who is the main competitor of Christian. After Christian wins his first professional fight against Axel, he comes out by kissing Oliver in the ring. After the celebration, Oliver is brutally attacked by Axel and despite being dismissed as healthy at the hospital, a few days later he suffers a brain hemorrhage as a consequence of the attack and undergoes brain surgery to save his life. The next hard test of their relationship comes from Rob, a successful party planner that bonds with Oliver by planning events at Oliver's bar, No Limits, while secretly attempting to use it as a drug dealing joint. At the same time, he attempts to seduce Oliver, who dismisses Christian's suspicion about Rob as mere jealousy. Christian attempts to prove Oliver that he's right about Rob. But Oliver refuses to believe it, even when NoLimits gets raided by the police when being tipped off by any anonymous call that someone witnessed drugs being exchanged there, Oliver even believes Christian set the whole thing up, much to Christian's anger and frustration. At the same time, Oliver starts to doubt that Christian is really attracted to him and begins suspecting that he's into women again, this being fueled when Rebecca von Lahnstein falls in love with Christian and eventually kisses him and Christian's drunken kiss with Miriam sometime prior to it. Oliver soon asks him, bluntly, if he's into women again, causing them to consider a break up. However, after considering all the hard times they have endured together, the two decide to try fresh this time. At the end, Rebecca exposes Rob to the police, who gets arrested, and Oliver and Christian make amends thanks to a romantic trip to New York. Christian, a little while after their trip to New York, suffers an episode of chest pain and is taken to the hospital by Andi. However, when he rushes to the hospital to learn how he is doing, Oliver is not allowed to know any details about Christian's condition as he's not a relative. When Christian goes to Sebastian von Lahnstein to file documents to fix any future health concerns for them hospital-wise as a couple, Miriam suggests marriage to Oliver as an easy fix who responds with excitement to propose to Christian and begins making plans for a romantic proposal. Oliver decorates No Limits in Valentine's Day decorations and proposes to Christian later on during the night, leaving Christian clearly shocked. He then says yes to Oliver's proposal. The two go on to start making plans for their wedding and despite having different views on a wedding - Christian wanting a small and private wedding whereas Oliver wants it to be a very big public deal, the two learn to compromise for each other. Oliver's happiness with Christian is cut short by the sudden appearance of his ex-boyfriend Jonas, who comes to tell Oliver that he is HIV-positive and admits that he was sure he had the disease back when they were together. Oliver becomes scared he may have contracted the disease as well and later admits the dilemma to Christian. Christian tries to assure him that if he and Jonas used a condom then he may not have contracted it, but Oliver reveals it was a one-night stand and they were both drunk. Oliver then brings up the possibility to Christian that if he indeed contracted the disease, then he may have passed it on to him during their time together. The two then get Oliver tested to find out the results. After anxiously waiting, the doctor soon confirms that Oliver doesn't have HIV, much to his and Christian's relief. The two return home and while sitting in the hallway happily, Christian proposes to Oliver himself by declaring that the day proved to him even more that he never wants to lose him and that he wants to get married \\"sooner rather than later\\". Oliver and him then decide on 4 weeks from that day to get married. In September 2010, Oliver marries Christian on a church wedding and is more than happy to be with the man he loves. After Christian comes back after a short trip with Gregor and looking after his brother's children, Christian declares he wants to have a child much to Oliver's happiness. After a failed attempt of adoption, and a failed attempt at having a child with a lesbian couple who want a rigorous schedule with the child, the two act as foster parents for a Cameroonese girl. The strain of losing her after her father takes her back to Cameroon damages their relationship, and a fight leads to Christian partying with Jessica Stiehl, who later claims both of them had sex. This triggers again Oliver's doubts about Christian's attraction to him, and calls for a break on the relationship, making Christian move out and distracting himself from his pain by partying. Oliver then suffers another deep blow after witnessing Phillip zu Hohenfelden being hit by a car while he stopped on mid- street to greet Olli, being struck with guilt by thinking he made Phillip to stop, thus causing the accident. Guilt ridden, he shuts himself in his apartment for several days. Christian later has sex with a female coworker, adding another trouble to their relationship. After coming out of his depression, Oliver models for a publicity campaign and starts a fling with Rafael, a young man he met on Majorca during a vacation. After finally giving up on Christian, he begins a happy relationship with Rafael. He and Christian soon agree to divorce, but later afterwards, Oliver hears from a horrified Andi that he's just been told that Christian is at the boxing ring battling against a friend of Axel's. Fearing for Christian due to his heart condition, he quickly goes to the boxing ring and arrives in time to witness Christian suffer a heart attack and collapse. The shock of truly losing Christian causes Oliver to realize that, despite all his doubts and the trouble, he still loves him. After the paramedics make several failed attempts to restart Christian's heart, Oliver believes Christian has died and leaves the boxing ring in a daze, unaware of Christian's heart starting back up again successfully as he leaves. Oliver returns home and breaks up with Rafael, telling him that all they had was an affair and that he doesn't love him. He explains that he truly loves Christian, informing him of his assumed death. Oliver wanders around the city for a bit before running into an escaped hospital patient in the same area, who tells him that she is there because she can feel her deceased husband's love there the most. He returns her to the hospital before being informed that Christian is indeed the hospital, initially thinking he is in the morgue, but is told that he is actually in intensive care and alive. Oliver immediately goes to Christian to see him and confesses that he still loves him and wants to be with him for the rest of his life. The two tenderly and happily reunite. On 3 January 2012 Oliver and Christian get married for a second time in the cabin outside in which they first fell in love. In June 2012, Oliver loses his bar license after he unadvertedly serves alcohol to minors during a party, and he ends up selling the name rights of No Limits to Tristan and Marlene, who launch a new No Limits, keeping Olli as a manager. At the same time, he begins working as a model for Tanja von Lahnstein. In October 2012, he discovers evidence (left to him by Arno Brandner in a letter written shortly before his death) that he has a long-lost sister, and tracks her down. She is revealed to be named Bella Jacob and lives on the city of Tübingen, unaware that she's adopted. In late 2012, Christian takes a job in England and the couple agrees to have a long-distance relationship, parting ways with a sweet kiss. In September 2013 Christian returns and the couple spends many joyful moments. However, Christian announces that he has renewed his England contract for an extra year, causing friction between the two before, through misunderstanding a hospital situation when Christian gets his coat mugged and is mistaken for a critically injured person, the two make up. Despite this, their situation once again becomes wedged when Christian admits to have cheated once again with a woman during a drunken one night stand while in England, much to Oliver's devastation. Despite later returning and claiming to want an open marriage to teach Christian a lesson, when an opportunity arises to sleep with a man, Oliver is unable to go through with it. He simply begins ignoring and distancing himself from Christian, who is regularly begging for forgiveness. When Christian finally believes it is truly over between them, he books a flight for England and prepares to leave after one last failed attempt to talk with Oliver who once again ignores him. Jessica, who is watching from the hallway, becomes exasperated with the two and locks the couple inside their room together to force them to talk, saying she'll be back from work in several hours. During this time period, Christian convinces Oliver he is truly sorry. Eventually, Oliver requests all the details of his one-night stand, saying it may make him able to forgive again. When Christian admits he doesn't remember due to being drunk the entire time, he insists nobody will ever compare to being with him because he loves him. Oliver finally forgives him and the couple make up. Oliver then agrees to go to England with Christian for a short period in order to rebuild their relationship together. Then, after months of long-distance relationship, Oliver was under the influence of alcohol and had a one-night stand with another man. Oliver later phone Christian then flew over to see him in London. Only to come home with news of their divorce.

O'Sullivan joined the team as substitute goalkeeper during the 1963 championship, and took over as first- choice goalkeeper at the end of the decade. He retained that position until his retirement after the 1972 championship. During that time he won one All- Ireland medal and one Munster medal. At club level O'Sullivan enjoyed a lengthy career with Cashel King Cormacs GAA. Playing career Club O'Sullivan played his club hurling with his local Cashel club. Inter- county O'Sullivan first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Tipperary minor hurling team in the early 1960s. He won a Munster title in this grade in 1961, following a 7-11 to 1-6 trouncing of fierce rivals Cork. Tipp subsequently lined out against Kilkenny in the All- Ireland minor decider.

The game itself is still remembered for the image of Babs Keating discarding his worn-out boots and playing the last few minutes of the match in his bare feet. The victory gave O'Sullivan a senior All-Ireland winners' medal in the senior grade.

Examples include some cyanobacteria, some gastropods, the ferns Azolla and Salvinia and the seed plants Lemna, Wolffia, Pistia, Eichhornia crassipes and Hydrocharis. Some fungi and fungi-like protists may be also found. Neuston The term Neuston is used either: *As a synonym for Pleuston: hence, the collective term for the organisms that float on the top of water (epineuston) or live just below the surface (hyponeuston). *For that subset of floating organisms that are microscopic or those that rely on surface tension to float. This is in comparison with the term pleuston, which is then its superset, including those organisms that float by buoyancy or are macroscopic. A flying fish Neustons, broadly defined, are made up of some species of fish (see flying fish), beetles (see whirligig beetle), protozoans, bacteria and spiders (see fishing spider and diving bell spider). Springtails in the genera Podura and Sminthurides are almost exclusively neustonic, while Hypogastrura species often aggregate on pond surfaces. Water striders such as Gerris are common examples of insects that support their weight on water's surface tension. By extension, the term may also refer to non-organismal floating aggregations (see, e.g., Great Pacific Garbage Patch). Distinction versus other aquatic life Plankton (organisms that float or drift within the water) are distinguished from nekton (organisms that swim, powerfully, in the water), and benthos (organisms on the bottom of a body of water).  Environmental factors  There are different environmental factors such as flood pulses and droughts, and these environmental factors affect species such as pleuston, whether the effects lead to more or less variations in the species. When flood pulses (an abiotic factor) occur, connectivity between different aquatic environments occur. Species that live in environments with irregular flood patterns tend to have more variations, or even decrease species and variations; similar idea to what happens when droughts occur.

This dephosphorylation reaction occurs in smooth muscle tissue and initiates the relaxation process of the muscle cells. Thus, myosin phosphatase undoes the muscle contraction process initiated by myosin light-chain kinase. The enzyme is composed of three subunits: the catalytic region (protein phosphatase 1, or PP1), the myosin binding subunit (MYPT1), and a third subunit (M20) of unknown function. The catalytic region uses two manganese ions as catalysts to dephosphorylate the light-chains on myosin, which causes a conformational change in the myosin and relaxes the muscle. The enzyme is highly conserved and is found in all organisms’ smooth muscle tissue. While it is known that myosin phosphatase is regulated by rho-associated protein kinases, there is current debate about whether other molecules, such as arachidonic acid and cAMP, also regulate the enzyme. Function Smooth muscle tissue is mostly made of actin and myosin,Page 174 in: The vascular smooth muscle cell: molecular and biological responses to the extracellular matrix. Authors: Stephen M. Schwartz, Robert P. Mecham. Editors: Stephen M. Schwartz, Robert P. Mecham. Contributors: Stephen M. Schwartz, Robert P. Mecham. Publisher: Academic Press, 1995. , two proteins that interact together to produce muscle contraction and relaxation. Myosin II, also known as conventional myosin, has two heavy chains that consist of the head and tail domains and four light chains (two per head) that bind to the heavy chains in the “neck” region. When the muscle needs to contract, calcium ions flow into the cytosol from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, where they activate calmodulin, which in turn activates myosin light-chain kinase (MLC kinase). MLC kinase phosphorylates the myosin light chain (MLC20) at the Ser-19 residue. This phosphorylation causes a conformational change in the myosin, activating crossbridge cycling and causing the muscle to contract. Because myosin undergoes a conformational change, the muscle will stay contracted even if calcium and activated MLC kinase concentrations are brought to normal levels. The conformational change must be undone to relax the muscle. When myosin phosphatase binds to myosin, it removes the phosphate group. Without the group, the myosin reverts to its original conformation, in which it cannot interact with the actin and hold the muscle tense, so the muscle relaxes. The muscle will remain in this relaxed position until myosin is phosphorylated by MLC kinase and undergoes a conformational change. Structure A 3D representation of PP1 (shown in red) and a portion of MYPT1 (shown in blue), with the manganese ion catalysts shown in white. The yellow lines mark the grooves that are critical for enzyme binding and catalysis. Myosin phosphatase is made of three subunits. The catalytic subunit, PP1, is one of the more important Ser/Thr phosphatases in eukaryotic cells, as it plays a role in glycogen metabolism, intracellular transport, protein synthesis, and cell division as well as smooth muscle contraction. Because it is so important to basic cellular functions, and because there are far fewer protein phosphatases than kinases in cells, PP1’s structure and function is highly conserved (though the specific isoform used in myosin phosphatase is the δ isoform, PP1δ). PP1 works by using two manganese ions as catalysts for the dephosphorylation (see below). Surrounding these ions is a Y-shaped cleft with three grooves: a hydrophobic, an acidic, and a C-terminal groove. When PP1 is not bonded to any other subunit, it is not particularly specific. However, when it bonds to the second subunit of myosin phosphatase, MYPT1 (MW ~130 kDa), this catalytic cleft changes configuration. This results in a dramatic increase in myosin specificity. Thus, it is clear that MYPT1 has great regulatory power over PP1 and myosin phosphatase, even without the presence of other activators or inhibitors. The third subunit, M20 (not to be confused with MLC20, the critical regulatory subunit of myosin), is the smallest and most mysterious subunit. Currently little is known about M20, except that it is not necessary for catalysis, as removing the subunit does not affect turnover or selectivity. While some believe it could have regulatory function, nothing has been determined yet. Mechanism The mechanism of removing the phosphate from Ser-19 is very similar to other dephosphorylation reactions in the cell, such as the activation of glycogen synthase. Myosin's regulatory subunit MLC20 binds to both the hydrophobic and acid grooves of PP1 and MYPT1, the regulatory site on myosin phosphatase. Once in the proper configuration, both the phyosphorylated serine and a free water molecule are stabilized by the hydrogen-bonding residues in the active site, as well as the positively charged ions (which interact strongly with the negative phosphate group). His-125 (on myosin phosphatase) donates a proton to Ser-19 MLC20), and the water molecule attacks the phosphorus atom. After shuffling protons to stabilize (which happens rapidly compared to the attack on phosphorus), the phosphate and alcohol are formed, and both leave the active site. The mechanism of PP1 for myosin phosphatase, with critical enzyme residues shown. The substrates and products are bold and in red, and the manganese ions are in blue. The alcohol group shown on myosin after dephosphorylation is the alcohol on Ser-19. Regulation and Human Health The regulatory pathways of MLC kinase have been well- established, but until the late 1980s, it was assumed that myosin phosphatase was not regulated, and contraction/relaxation was entirely dependent on MLC kinase activity. However, since the 1980s, the inhibiting effect of rho- associated protein kinase has been discovered and thoroughly investigated. RhoA GTP activates Rho-kinase, which phosphorylates the MYPT1 at two major inhibitory sites, Thr-696 and Thr-866. This fully demonstrates the value of the MYPT1, not only to increase reaction rate and specificity, but also to greatly slow down the reaction. However, when telokin is added, it effectively undoes the effect of Rho-kinase, even though it does not dephosphorylate MYPT1. One other proposed regulatory strategy involves arachidonic acid. When arachidonic acid is added to tensed muscle tissue, the acid decreases the rate of dephosphorylation (and thus relaxation) of myosin. However, it is unclear how arachidonic acid functions as an inhibitor. Two competing theories are that either arachidonic acid acts as a co-messenger in the rho-kinase cascade mentioned above, or that it binds to the c-terminal of MYPT1. When the regulatory systems of myosin phosphatase begin to fail, there can be major health consequences. Since smooth muscle is found in the respiratory, circulatory, and reproductive systems of humans (as well as other places), if the smooth muscle can no longer relax because of faulty regulation, then a wide number of problems ranging from asthma, hypertension, and erectile dysfunction can result.

She is currently a principal dancer at San Francisco Ballet. She had previously danced at the Royal Danish Ballet, and was the youngest ever dancer to receive a contract at the company. Early life Van Patten was born in Boston. She started with ballet, tap and jazz, and later focused on ballet. Van Patten trained at Boston Ballet and began performing at age 8 in their annual performance of The Nutcracker. She later switched to Ballet Workshop of New England and performed at Massachusetts Youth Ballet under Jacqueline Cronsberg. Van Patten also learned some of George Balanchine's works, such as Serenade and Apollo under the direction of Cronsberg's daughter, Sandra Jennings, who danced at the New York City Ballet. Van Patten attended school at Newton Country Day School of the Sacred Heart and spent her summers studying with Jean-Pierre Bonnefeux, Violette Verdy, and Patricia McBride at the Chautauqua Institution. Career When Van Patten was 15, Jennings recommended her to audition for the Royal Danish Ballet in Copenhagen, which was co-directed by Jennings' former colleague, Colleen Neary. Van Patten was offered an apprenticeship and was one of the few foreign dancers in the company. Three months later, she was chosen by choreographer John Neumeier to dance the opening night cast in a revival of his Romeo and Juliet, with Mads Blangstrup, a principal, as her Romeo. She turned 16 shortly before she debuted the role. In 2001, at age 17, Van Patten became a member of the corps de ballet, thus became the youngest dancer to receive a contract in the company's history. Later that year, she joined the San Francisco Ballet as a soloist, after meeting Helgi Tomasson, the director of the company, when he was staging his version of The Sleeping Beauty in Copenhagen. Van Patten became a principal dancer in 2007. Her repertoire include lead roles such as Odette/Odile in Swan Lake, the title role in Giselle, the title role in The Little Mermaid and Tatiana in Onegin. She had also originated such as in Justin Peck's Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming, Cathy Marston's Snowblind, Arthur Pita's Björk Ballet and Christopher Wheeldon's Within a Golden Hour, and danced the role of Stepsister Edwina in the North American premiere of Wheeldon's Cinderella, which was a co-production with Dutch National Ballet. She performed at galas in Europe and Australia.

It is built around a short filament of actin related protein-1 (Arp1). Discovery Dynactin was identified as an activity that allowed purified cytoplasmic dynein to move membrane vesicles along microtubules in vitro. It was shown to be a multiprotein complex and named \\"dynactin\\" because of its role in dynein activation. The main features of dynactin were visualized by quick-freeze, deep-etch, rotary shadow electron microscopy. It appears as a short filament, 37-nm in length, which resembles F-actin, plus a thinner, laterally oriented arm. Antibody labelling was used to map the location of the dynactin subunits.  Structure  Dynactin consists of three major structural domains: (1) sidearm-shoulder: DCTN1/p150Glued, DCTN2/p50/dynamitin, DCTN3/p24/p22;(2)the Arp1 filament: ACTR1A/Arp1/centractin, actin, CapZ; and (3) the pointed end complex: Actr10/Arp11, DCTN4/p62, DCTN5/p25, and DCTN6/p27. A 4Å cryo-EM structure of dynactin revealed that its filament contains eight Arp1 molecules, one β-actin and one Arp11. In the pointed end complex p62/DCTN4 binds to Arp11 and β-actin and p25 and p27 bind both p62 and Arp11. At the barbed end the capping protein (CapZαβ) binds the Arp1 filament in the same way that it binds actin, although with more charge complementarity, explaining why it binds dynactin more tightly than actin. The shoulder contains two copies of p150Glued/DCTN1, four copies of p50/DCTN2 and two copies of p24/DCTN3. These proteins form long bundles of alpha helices, which wrap over each other and contact the Arp1 filament. The N-termini of p50/DCTN2 emerge from the shoulder and coat the filament, providing a mechanism for controlling the filament length. The C-termini of the p150Glued/DCTN1 dimer are embedded in the shoulder, whereas the N-terminal 1227 amino acids form the projecting arm. The arm consists of an N-terminal CAPGly domain which can bind the C-terminal tails of microtubules and the microtubule plus end binding protein EB1. This is followed by a basic region, also involved in microtubule binding, a folded-back coiled coil (CC1), the intercoiled domain (ICD) and a second coiled coil domain (CC2). The p150Glued arm can dock into against the side of the Arp1 filament and pointed end complex. DCTN2 (dynamitin) is also involved in anchoring microtubules to centrosomes and may play a role in synapse formation during brain development. Arp1 has been suggested as the domain for dynactin binding to membrane vesicles (such as Golgi or late endosome) through its association with β-spectrin. The pointed end complex (PEC) has been shown to be involved in selective cargo binding. PEC subunits p62/DCTN4 and Arp11/Actr10 are essential for dynactin complex integrity and dynactin/dynein targeting to the nuclear envelope before mitosis. Actr10 along with Drp1 (Dynamin related protein 1) have been documented as vital to the attachment of mitochondria to the dynactin complex.Catherine Drerup, Amy Herbert, Kelly Monk, Alex Nechiporuk, \\"Regulation of mitochondria-dynactin interaction and mitochondrial retrograde transport in axons\\" Dynactin p25/DCTN5 and p27/DCTN6 are not essential for dynactin complex integrity, but are required for early and recycling endosome transport during the interphase and regulation of the spindle assembly checkpoint in mitosis. Interaction with dynein Dynein and dynactin were reported to interact directly by the binding of dynein intermediate chains with p150Glued. The affinity of this interaction is around 3.5μM. Dynein and dynactin do not run together in a sucrose gradient, but can be induced to form a tight complex in the presence of the N-terminal 400 amino acids of Bicaudal D2 (BICD2), a cargo adaptor that links dynein and dynactin to Golgi derived vesicles. In the presence of BICD2, dynactin binds to dynein and activates it to move for long distances along microtubules. A cryo-EM structure of dynein, dynactin and BICD2 showed that the BICD2 coiled coil runs along the dynactin filament. The tail of dynein also binds to the Arp1 filament, sitting in the equivalent site that myosin uses to bind actin. The contacts between the dynein tail and dynactin all involve BICD, explaining why it is needed to bring them together. The dynein/dynactin/BICD2 (DDB) complex has also been observed, by negative stain EM, on microtubules. This shows that the cargo (Rab6) binding end of BICD2 extends out through the pointed end complex at the opposite end away from the dynein motor domains. Functions Dynactin is often essential for dynein activity and can be thought of as a \\"dynein receptor\\" that modulates binding of dynein to cell organelles which are to be transported along microtubules. Dynactin also enhances the processivity of cytoplasmic dynein and kinesin-2 motors. Dynactin is involved in various processes like chromosome alignment and spindle organization in cell division. Dynactin contributes to mitotic spindle pole focusing through its binding to nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA). Dynactin also targets to the kinetochore through binding between DCTN2/dynamitin and zw10 and has a role in mitotic spindle checkpoint inactivation. During prometaphase, dynactin also helps target polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) to kinetochores through cyclin dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1)-phosphorylated DCTN6/p27, which is involved in proper microtubule-kinetochore attachment and recruitment of spindle assembly checkpoint protein Mad1. In addition, dynactin has been shown to play an essential role in maintaining nuclear position in Drosophila, zebrafish or in different fungi. Dynein and dynactin concentrate on the nuclear envelope during the prophase and facilitate nuclear envelope breakdown via its DCTN4/p62 and Arp11 subunits. Dynactin is also required for microtubule anchoring at centrosomes and centrosome integrity. Destabilization of the centrosomal pool of dynactin also causes abnormal G1 centriole separation and delayed entry into S phase, suggesting that dynactin contributes to the recruitment of important cell cycle regulators to centrosomes. In addition to transport of various organelles in the cytoplasm, dynactin also links kinesin II to organelles.

K45AR was used for the first educational instructional television (ITV) system in the state. The station was run by the schools of Bertha-Hewitt, Clarissa, and Eagle Bend.KCMT news report on KXG2CB, 1982  History  K45AR was the idea of Eagle Bend High School principal Richard Lundgren. Lundgren was in search of getting a way to provide more educational opportunities to his students for a low cost. Instructional television allowed schools to sharing teachers without the teachers or students leaving their respective schools. When K45AR first went on the air it operated under the experimental license KG2XCB. Its first transmitter was located in Eagle Bend. Its power was 100 watts and its tower was about 190 ft. Along with Eagle Bend Public School, the Bertha-Hewitt and Clarissa public schools each owned an ITFS microwave transmitter to broadcast via closed circuit between schools. Each school was located approximately 5 miles apart from each other. With this system the schools could teach classes from each site and the students could interact with the teachers at each site. Because KG2XCB broadcast on a conventional UHF channel in the clear, people with a regular antenna could receive the signal at home and watch the classes being offered by the schools. The station also broadcast adult and children's educational programs when the three schools were not broadcasting.KSTP news report on KXG2CB, 1982 In January 1980 the system was dedicated, attended by people from all over Minnesota and the United States. In October 1984 the FCC granted a license to upgrade KG2XCB to become K45AR, a regular low-power UHF TV station. It now had a new tower of 365 ft. and a new transmitter capable of 1,000 watts. Because of its new height and power the three schools added 2 more schools to its ITV system -- Parkers Prairie and Staples Public Schools. Because of growing cost issues to the station's up-keep, the station was taken off the air and sold in 1998.

The hot and humid climate of Mississippi makes it very difficult to cultivate vitis vinifera or French hybrid grapes. The three commercial wineries in Mississippi focus almost entirely on the Muscadine grape, a variety also used for non-alcoholic grape juices, jams, and jellies. Most of the Mississippi Delta AVA, a designated American Viticultural Area, lies within the state boundaries of Mississippi.  History  Mississippi has been producing wines since the state was established in 1817. Families created their own blends using the abundant muscadine grape that grows freely in the sub-tropical region. The use of this grape yields a sweet wine that creates a refreshing experience on humid days; and therefore, quickly became popular among residents. However, thirteen years before Prohibition in the United States, in 1907, wine production was suppressed due to a statute banning the manufacture and sale of Mississippi wine. Due to the long-lasting effect prohibition created in the deep south, Mississippi was the last state to repeal the Volstead Act in 1966, and many counties remain dry through present day. The obstacles that history has created for wine production in the state are still being overcome. Currently, there are 3 commercial wineries, one American Viticultural Area, and no listed wine trails for the state of Mississippi.  Climate & Geography  Mississippi is in the south-east of the United States and is bordered east by Alabama, west by Louisiana, north by Tennessee, and south by the Gulf of Mexico. This location, with latitudes of 30 degrees N and 35 degrees N, produces a sub-tropical climate with long, humid summers and short, mild winters. Fungal diseases like mildew and Pierce disease are widespread. Unforeseeable weather patterns stemming from the Gulf of Mexico also present a large risk for growing seasons. The unpredictable Mississippi climate makes it difficult to grow other varieties of grapes, which is why the state's wine industry has never seen any significant emergence.  The Muscadine Grape  The condition of Mississippi's climate and Terroir makes it nearly impossible to grow Vitis vinifera, or French hybrid grape varieties. Mississippi wineries cultivate the muscadine grape and its varieties due to its abundance throughout the region and resistance to humid conditions. Muscadine is the title given to a group of vine varieties most common in the South-Eastern United States. The varieties of the muscadine grape can be either light or dark and have very thick skins which make them highly resistant to fungal and bacterial diseases that thrive in humid weather. As the health benefits of wine gain significance in the wine industry, so do muscadines, as it is known that their thick skins contain high levels of the compound Resveratrol, which is linked to heart health and cancer prevention. Also of great prevalence, is the muscadine's opposition to Phylloxera, which plagued Europe's vineyards in the late 19th century. This evolutionary trait has helped scientists in making noteworthy progress towards finding a solution for phylloxera. Consequently, almost all Vitis vinifera vines are joined with elements of phylloxera-resistant American vine species like the muscadine.  Wineries  The 3 listed Mississippi wineries are Almarla Vineyards, Gulf Coast Winery, and Old South Winery. Almarla Vineyards, located in Shubuta,Mississippi and Gulf Coast Winery, located in Gulf Port, MS have little information listed. However, it is known that both wineries utilize the muscadine grape and its varieties to cultivate sweet wines. Old South Winery, located in Natchez, MS, opened in 1979 with the intent to provide residents and tourists alike with \\"The Best in Everything Muscadine\\". Old South winery lists 10 different wines on their website that fall under the categories: Red, White, and Rose & Other wines. Their red blends which utilize the noble grape variety of the muscadine consist of Sweet Noble, Dry Noble, and semi-dry red Natchez Rouge. Similarly, their white blends consist of: semi-sweet white Southern Belle, sweet whites Blue Bayou and Sweet Magnolia, and dry white Carlos, which utilizes the carlos grape variety of the muscadine. They also list two roses, sweet rose Miss Scarlett and semi-sweet rose Miss Blush, along with a semi-sweet blueberry wine named Blueberry Thrill.  Mississippi Delta AVA  The Mississippi Delta AVA, formed in 1984 and shared with Mississippi's border states Tennessee and Louisiana has not attracted any large-scale Viticulture endeavors. Regardless of widespread confidence in the AVA, obstacles like Mississippi's tough growing climate and prohibition from 1907-1966 have deterred wine production in the area. The small amount of wine that is produced in the Mississippi Delta consists almost entirely of the muscadine grape and its varieties. The wine is mostly consumed locally; and therefore, is rarely promoted outside the state. References # Appellation America (2007). [1]Mississippi: Appellation Description.

The two substrates of PAP are phosphatidate and H2O, and its two products are diacylglycerol and phosphate, as shown here. :a 1,2-diacylglycerol 3-phosphate + H2O \\\\rightleftharpoons a 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol (DAG) + phosphate The reverse reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme diacylglycerol kinase (DGK or DAGK), which replaces the hydroxyl group on diacylgylcerol with a phosphate from ATP, generating ADP in the process. While ATP is used by DGK in mammalian cells, yeast cells tend to use CTP as the high-energy phosphate donor instead. Mechanistically speaking, this has no effect on the overall reaction. In yeast, the forward direction is Mg^2+-dependent, while the reverse direction is Ca^2+-dependent. PAP1, a cytosolic phosphatidate phosphatase found in the lung, is also Mg^2+-dependent, but PAP2, a six-transmembrane-domain integral protein found in the plasma membrane, is not. Reactants and products of the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme phosphatidate phosphatase, and thus also those of the reverse reaction, which is catalyzed by the enzyme diacylglycerol kinase.  Role in the regulation of lipid flux  PAP regulates lipid metabolism in several ways. In short, PAP is a key player in controlling the overall flux of triacylglycerols to phospholipids and vice versa, also exerting control through the generation and degradation of lipid-signaling molecules related to phosphatidate. When PAP is active, diacylglycerols formed by PAP can go on to form any of several products, including phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and triacylglycerol. Phospholipids can be formed from diacylglycerol through reaction with activated alcohols, and triacylglycerols can be formed from DAG through reaction with fatty acyl CoA molecules. When PAP is inactive, DGK drives the reaction in reverse, allowing phosphatidate to accumulate as it brings down DAG levels. Phosphatidate can then be converted into an activated form, CDP-DAG, through the liberation of a pyrophosphate from a CTP molecule, or into cardiolipin. CDP-DAG is a principal precursor used by the body in phospholipid synthesis. Furthermore, because both phosphatidate and DAG function as secondary messengers, PAP is able to exert extensive and intricate control of lipid metabolism far beyond its local effect on phopshatidate and DAG concentrations and the resulting effect on the direction of lipid flux as outlined above.  Enzyme regulation  PAP is upregulated by CDP- diacylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol (formed from reaction of CDP-DAG with inositol), and cardiolipin. PAP is downregulated by sphingosine and dihydrosphingosine. This makes sense in the context of the discussion above. Namely, a build up of products that are formed from phosphatidate serves to upregulate PAP, the enzyme that consumes phosphatidate, thereby acting as a signal that phosphatidate is in abundance and causing its consumption. At the same time, a build up of products that are formed from DAG serves to downregulate PAP, the enzyme that forms DAG, thereby acting as a signal that DAG is in abundance and its production should be slowed.  Classification  PAP belongs to the family of enzymes known as hydrolases, and more specifically to the hydrolases that act on phosphoric monoester bonds. This enzyme participates in 4 metabolic pathways: glycerolipid, glycerophospholipid, ether lipid, and sphingolipid metabolism.  Nomenclature  The systematic name of this enzyme class is diacylglycerol-3-phosphate phosphohydrolase. Other names in common use include: * phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP), * 3-sn-phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, * acid phosphatidyl phosphatase, * phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase, * phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, and * lipid phosphate phosphohydrolase (LPP).  Types  There are several different genes that code for phosphatidate phosphatases. They fall into one of two types (type I and type II), depending on their cellular localization and substrate specificity.  Type I  Type I phosphatidate phosphatases are soluble enzymes that can associate to membranes. They are found mainly in the cytosol and the nucleus. Encoded for by a group of genes named Lipin, they are substrate specific only to phosphatidate. There are speculated to be involved in the de novo synthesis of glycerolipids. Each of the 3 Lipin proteins found in mammals—Lipin1, Lipin2, and Lipin3—has unique tissue expression motifs and distinct physiological functions. = Regulation = Regulation of mammalian Lipin PAP enzymes occurs at the transcriptional level. For example, Lipin1 is induced by glucocorticoids during adipocyte differentiation as well as in cells that are experiencing ER proliferation. Lipin2, on the other hand, is repressed during adipocyte differentiation.  Type II  Type II phosphatidate phosphatases are transmembrane enzymes found mainly in the plasma membrane. They can dephosphorylate other substrates besides phosphatidate, and therefore are also known as lipid phosphate phosphatases. Their main role is in lipid signaling and in phospholipid head-group remodeling. One example of a type II phosphatidate phosphatase is PgpB (PDBe: 5jwy). PgpB is one of three integral membrane phosphatases in Escherichia coli that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of phosphatidylglycerol phosphate (PGP) to PG (phosphatidylglycerol). The other two are PgpA and PgpC. While all three catalyze the reaction from PGP to PG, their amino acid sequences are dissimilar and it is predicted that their active sites open to different sides of the cytoplasmic membrane. PG accounts for approximately 20% of the total membrane lipid composition in the inner membrane of bacteria. PgpB is competitively inhibited by phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), a phospholipid formed from DAG. This is therefore an example of negative feedback regulation. The enzyme active site contains a catalytic triad Asp-211, His-207, and His-163 that establishes a charge relay system. However, this catalytic triad is essential for the dephosphorylation of lysophosphatidic acid, phosphatidic acid, and sphingosine-1-phosphate, but is not essential in its entirety for the enzyme's native substrate, phosphatidylglycerol phosphate; His-207 alone is sufficient to hydrolyze PGP. centerIn the cartoon depiction of PgpB below, one can see its six transmembrane alpha helices, which are here shown horizontally. Of the three PGP phosphatases discussed above, PgpB is the only to have multiple transmembrane alpha helices.PgpB (PDBe: 5jwy) cartoon with ribbons. Made in MacPyMOL.  Genes  Human genes that encode phosphatidate phosphatases include: * PPAP2A (LPP1) – phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2A * PPAP2B (LPP3) – phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2B * PPAP2C (LPP2) – phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2C * PPAPDC1A (PPC1A) – phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2 domain containing 1A * PPAPDC1B (PPC1B) – phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2 domain containing 1B * PPAPDC2 – phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2 domain containing 2 * PPAPDC3 – phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2 domain containing 3 * LPPR2 – lipid phosphate phosphatase-related protein type 2 * LPPR3 – lipid phosphate phosphatase-related protein type 3 * LPPR4 – lipid phosphate phosphatase-related protein type 4 * LPIN1 – lipin 1 * LPIN2 – lipin 2 * LPIN3 – lipin 3  Pathology  Lipin-1 deficiency in mice results in lipodystrophy, insulin resistance, and neuropathy. In humans, variations in Lipin-1 expression levels can result in insulin sensitivity, hypertension, and risk for metabolic syndrome. Serious mutations in Lipin-2 lead to an inflammatory disorder in humans.

The play centres on a murder mystery involving an artist who dies from falling down a set of stairs. The play is a humorous exploration of the meaning and purpose of art. The title alludes to Marcel Duchamp's painting Nude Descending a Staircase. Plot The play opens with the sound of the artist, Donner, falling down the stairs. The other two roommates, Martello and Beauchamp, enter and find him at the bottom of the staircase. Beauchamp, an artist whose focus is on the sounds of daily life, examines a recording of the sounds of Donner's fall. The pair decides that a murderer must have awakened Donner from his sleep and then pushed him down the stairs to his death. Martello and Beauchamp accuse each other of the crime. The following scenes flash back to several different years at least 50 years in the past. This part of the play follows the three artists and their interactions with a blind woman named Sophie. The end of the play returns to the present. Martello and Beauchamp are unable to solve the mystery.  Original production  The play was originally broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on 14 November 1972. It is now available on the BBC CD Tom Stoppard Radio Plays. In January 2016, BBC Radio 3 revived the play with a cast that included Derek Jacobi, Ian McDiarmid, Geoffrey Whitehead and Pippa Nixon. Theatrical production A stage adaptation, written by Stoppard, was first performed at the R.J. Reynolds Theatre, on the Duke University Campus, in 1989. It was followed by a Broadway production, at the Helen Hayes Theater. It featured the following cast: *Michael Cumpsty – Young Beauchamp *Jim Fyfe – Young Martello *Harold Gould – Beauchamp *John McMartin – Donner *Stephanie Roth – Sophie *Paxton Whitehead – Martello *Michael Winther – Young Donner •Produced by Dennis Grimaldi, Emanuel Azenberg, Robert Whitehead, Dick Button, Byron Goldman The production team was the following: * Director – Tim Luscombe * Assistant Director – Nicholas de Wolff * Scenic Design – Tony Straiges * Costume Design – Joseph G.

He was active as a jockey from 1947 to 1985 and rode a total of 2,810 winners in Britain. Mercer's nickname was \\"Smokin' Joe\\". He was apprenticed to trainer Frederick Sneyd and won his first British Classic race while still an apprentice on Ambiguity in the 1953 Epsom Oaks. He was British flat racing Champion Apprentice twice, in 1952 and 1953. He subsequently worked as stable jockey for Jack Colling, Dick Hern, Henry Cecil and Peter Walwyn. During his spell at Cecil's yard he won his only British flat racing Champion Jockey's title in 1979. The most successful horse Mercer rode during his career was Brigadier Gerard, winner of 17 of his 18 races between 1970 and 1972. He retired as a jockey in November 1985. He then worked initially as a jockey's agent before accepting a job as racing manager for Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum in 1987. He retired from that in January 2006. Career 1950s Mercer rode his first winner as an apprentice when he rode Eldoret to win a handicap race at Bath in September 1950. He was British flat racing Champion Apprentice jockey in both 1952 and 1953 riding 26 winners and 61 winners respectively. While still an apprentice Mercer won his first English Classic at the age of eighteen. Riding the Lord Astor (William Waldorf Astor, 3rd Viscount Astor) owned Ambiguity he gave Jack Colling his only classic victory when winning the 1953 Oaks. By this time Mercer was stable jockey at the Colling owned West Ilsley stable, having succeeded Gordon Richards in that post. Theirs was a successful partnership with a number of fine horses. These include: Hornbeam (winner of 11 races)- winner of the Great Voltigeur Stakes and second in the St Leger, Ascot Gold Cup and Doncaster Cup; Rosalba (winner of 6 races)- winner of the Coronation Stakes, Queen Elizabeth II Stakes, and Fred Darling Stakes, whilst achieving 2nd place in Petite Etoile's 1000 Guineas; and Counsel (winner of 10 races)- a top class handicapper and winner of the Greenham Stakes. In addition Mercer had many outside rides for other stables. His first prominent one was on the 1000 Guineas winner Festoon when she failed to win the Oaks, but also later when she gave Mercer his first Royal Ascot victory in the Coronation Stakes. He also rode a number of Harry Wragg trained horses specifically Nagami (whom he rode to be third in all the colts Classic races of 1958) and Fidalgo (whom he rode to be second in the Derby and St Leger of 1959, but on whom he won the Irish Derby of that year). 1960s Despite winning his jockey championship with Henry Cecil, it was his relationship with the West Ilsley stable under Dick Hern for which he is most famous. Hern took over as trainer at West Ilsley at the end of 1962 on the retirement of Jack Colling, and there was no question he would remain in place on Hern's takeover. The stable was endowed with several top owner- breeders and was now owned by John Jacob Astor (then known as Jakie Astor, and later as Sir John Astor), who with his brother Lord Astor provided most of the horse firepower. During the early years of the Hern/Mercer partnership they had most success with a series of stayers, the best of which was probably Grey of Falloden who won several stakes races (the Doncaster Cup and Henry II Stakes) but also won the 1964 Cesarewitch Handicap with a then record weight of 9stone 6pounds. The following year the stable hit top form and won both the English St. Leger Stakes and Irish St. Leger Stakes with Provoke (owned by Jakie) and Craighouse (owned by Lord Astor: William Astor, 3rd Viscount Astor) respectively. In both 1964 and 1965 Mercer rode 108 winners in Britain. Everything looked set for a wonderful 1966 when an equine virus hit the stable and the horses were just not well enough to be competitive. In 1967 there appeared to be some remission and the stable won 60 races. With this support from his own yard Mercer looked set to gain his first Jockey Championship. However having a comfortable lead mid-August he broke several vertebrae in a fall on a spare ride at Folkestone Racecourse. He was sidelined for the last two and a half months of the season. 1967 saw two future Classic possibles emerge in Remand and La Mome, but more importantly the Queen (Elizabeth II) first began to send horses to be trained by Dick Hern, thus initiating Mercer's tenure as a Royal Jockey. (However, for a few years another Royal Trainer Ian Balding did continue to use in addition Geoff Lewis and Lester Piggott). At the end of the 1967 season another important owner-breeder Brook Holliday began to send his horses to Hern, who had previously been the private trainer to his father (Major Lionel Holliday) at Newmarket. 1968 promised much and Mercer scored two early victories in Classic Trials when Heathen (owned by Holliday) won the Greenham Stakes and La Mome (owned by Jakie Astor) won the Princess Elizabeth Stakes. Early in May, Remand (owned also by Astor) beat Connaught in the Chester Vase, a recognised Epsom Derby trial, whilst giving the Noel Murless trained colt weight. Soon afterwards the horses appeared to lose form and Dick Hern described Remand's appearance in the paddock at Epsom prior to the Derby as being 'horrible, his coat was standing up like a hedgehog'. Beaten by both Sir Ivor and the Chester Vase second, Connaught, Remand finished fourth. Through the equine virus in the stables, Mercer missed a good chance of winning the Derby, a race he was ultimately never to win. Remand was very ill after the race, not appearing again that season and the stable went into decline. Despite shutting down completely for months on end, the virus did not leave the stable until the end of the 1969 season. However Mercer did manage to win the Doncaster Cup, a leading late-season Group race for his stable with The Accuser. Despite these setbacks Mercer remained loyal to Major Hern and West Ilsley. He did ride for many other stables and was particularly supported by Derrick Candy, for whom he rode horses such as Parbury (Ascot Gold Cup), Song (1968 Champion Sprinter and winner of the New Stakes, Temple Stakes, King's Stand Stakes and Diadem Stakes) and Fair Winter (Nassau Stakes), and Peter Walwyn, who was just developing a string of horses that became prominent in the 1970s. In 1969 he formed a successful partnership with Candy's staying horse High Line, taking many Group races. He also rode for the trainer John Sutcliffe, winning on such horses as Right Tack and Jimmy Reppin early in their careers. The foremost jockey at this time was Lester Piggott, who reportedly said \\"There are only two real jockeys and the other one is Joe Mercer.\\" When Piggott declined the ride on Petingo in order to ride Sir Ivor in the 1968 2,000 Guineas Stakes, Mercer was booked to ride Petingo by Piggott's father-in-law, Sam Armstrong. On Petingo he won the Craven Stakes and then finished second in the 2000 Guineas. Similarly when Piggott was unavailable for Ribofilio's 2,000 Guineas Trial in early 1969, Mercer took the ride and won on this Johnson-Houghton trained colt, already favourite for the 2000 Guineas. 1970s Mercer's loyalty was repaid in 1970, but the year started inauspiciously. He had spent the winter riding in India, could not bring home his earnings due to exchange control issues and decided to buy jewels to export instead. He fell foul of the Indian authorities and was imprisoned for several weeks, missing the first month of the flat season. He returned at the end of April but Jimmy Lindley retained the ride on the then stable star Highest Hopes in the One Thousand Guineas. He also missed the maiden win of the Queen's first good horse Charlton. He did ride him to his second win in the Predominate Stakes (now the Cocked Hat Stakes) at Goodwood in May. Unfortunately injury to the colt prevented his taking part in that year's Epsom Derby. Mercer may never have won The Derby but he gave a fine ride on Great Wall in Nijinsky's 1970 Derby. Great Wall had run very wide when he'd run in his Derby Trial and it seemed unwise for Scobie Breasley, his trainer, to declare him for Epsom and expect him to get round Tattenham Corner. Mercer got the ride for the first time and the colt's odds of 80 to 1 seemed ungenerous. Mercer kept his horse at the back of the field and going into Tattenham Corner had only one horse behind him. Entering the corner he set the colt alight on the rails to such effect that he passed the whole field in about a furlong and was leading the field with about two furlongs to go. He was then squeezed up by the giant French colt Gyr and was just run out of third place by Stintino. By the end of June 1970 the noted Brigadier Gerard had made his debut for Major Hern. There is little doubt that the Brigadier provided an enormous boost to the stable winning his four races in 1970, including the Group 1 Middle Park Stakes. In addition, Highest Hopes(owned by Holliday) came back from her disappointing run in the 1000 Guineas and won the Prix Eugène Adam and the Prix Vermeille, beating Caro and Lupe. The stable sustained its form until end of the season with Charlton proving to be slightly below the best, fourth in the St Leger; Heavenly Thought (owned by Lord Rotherwick, who purchased many of the now-deceased Lord Astor's horses) winning a handful of good races; and Fine Blade who at that time did not appear far behind Brigadier Gerard in ability. The end of the season saw a lot of activity as the last named was removed from the stable, together with the rest of Brook Holliday's horses following a payment disagreement with Hern. At the same time news arrived that following the retirement from training of Gordon Richards, his owners Sir Michael Sobell and Lady Beaverbrook would be transferring their horses to Dick Hern. Jakie Astor negotiated to sell West Ilsley to Sobell and his son-in-law Arnold Weinstock on the understanding that both Hern and Mercer were kept in place as trainer and stable jockey respectively. Before the 1971 flat season started most interest was on the Lady Beaverbrook-owned pair of Seaepic and Seaswan (both sired by Sea Bird II). Both disappointed in their trial races and later, whilst Brigadier Gerard, without a prep race, won what would in hindsight be regarded as the best Two Thousand Guineas since 1947. A Sobell/Weinstock-owned colt, Homeric, won the Lingfield Derby Trial ridden by Mercer. Homeric was the stable's first Derby runner since 1968 when running at Epsom but was outclassed by Mill Reef, finishing fifth. Later in the year Homeric finished second in the St. Leger under Mercer's ride. Brigadier Gerard finished the year the unbeaten winner of six races (five of them Group One). The new power to appear was in the two- year-old ranks, where three smart colts ran at Royal Ascot, all ridden by Mercer. Sun Prince, as a maiden, won the Coventry Stakes and later followed up by winning the Prix Robert Papin in France then finishing third in the Middle Park Stakes. Fellow maiden Sallust was made favourite for the Windsor Castle Stakes but finished unplaced. However he won his next race before ending his season with a win in the Richmond Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse. The third colt, Rampage, having won his maiden decisively attempted the Norfolk Stakes despite the presence of good horses such as Deep Diver and Philipp of Spain. Unfortunately Rampage died of a heart attack during the race. Mercer rode the Queen's first good filly at West Ilsley, Albany, to two victories that year. Starting the season by winning the Sandleford Priory Stakes at Newbury Racecourse in May and failing to stay the distance in The Oaks trip ran out a good winner of the two furlongs shorter Prix de la Psyche in France. Mercer rode the Brigadier in all his six wins but he also rode Lady Beaverbrook's Relko colt, Royalty, who set up an unbeaten run of six wins in the UK. It was felt that the horse may have improved enough to take his chance in the 1971 Arc de Triomphe against Mill Reef; and he did finish a creditable sixth. 1971 also saw Lord Rotherwick's Colum appear, who went on to secure wins in races which included the Dee Stakes, ultimately running and winning both in the UK and in France until the end of 1973. 1971 also saw Mercer's first winner for as a jockey for trainer Henry Cecil: Pert Lassie being the first leg of a Mercer treble at the inaugural Timeform Cancer Charity Day at Doncaster. If 1971 was a good year for Mercer and his stable, 1972 was even better in the quantity of money won and Hern ended up Champion Trainer. Brigadier Gerard was of course the main money winner, winning seven of his eight races (six of which would today be considered group one races) with Mercer in the saddle on all occasions. The Sunday prior to the Brigadier's third race of the season (at Royal Ascot) Mercer flew to France in a small plane with three others. Soon after take-off the plane crashed and luckily Mercer was thrown clear. He rushed back to the plane and pulled out the trainer Bill Marshall. He could not get the pilot out of the wreckage and gave up trying just before the plane exploded. Unsurprisingly Mercer was shaken up and there was talk that he would not take the ride on the Brigadier on the first day of Royal Ascot. After taking a day off Mercer declared himself fit to ride on the Tuesday of Royal Ascot and he lined up on Brigadier Gerard for the Prince of Wales's Stakes. As it was the Brigadier gave one of his most stunning displays beating a field which included the future Irish Derby winner, Steel Pulse, effortlessly. Unlike other runs Mercer reported that the horse did not pull as much as usual. However Mercer felt unwell after the race and did not ride again at the meeting or for the next week. That same Tuesday, Sun Prince won the St. James's Palace Stakes under Mercer's friend Jimmy Lindley, who replaced the sidelined Mercer. Sun Prince had been ridden into third place in the 2000 Guineas by Mercer, running behind High Top and the eventual Derby winner Roberto. By this stage Mercer appeared to have three of the best milers in the country to ride as apart from Sun Prince and Brigadier, Sallust had revealed himself as top class. This colt announced his return to the top with a fine display at Epsom to win the Diomed Stakes. Ridden again by Mercer in a virtual match at Goodwood he wore down the 2000 Guineas winner High Top in a thrilling Sussex Stakes. In late August he returned to Goodwood to win the Goodwood Mile and by then was regarded the best 3yo miler in England. In October he finished his career with a scintillating defeat of Lyphard in Mercer's hands at Longchamp to prove himself European's top 3yo miler. Of the older horses Royalty was injured without running but Homeric stood out: even if a little frustrating. In his second race of 1972 he took on Mill Reef in the Coronation Cup. Mercer took over the lead from Mill Reef's pacemaker and Homeric, kept beautifully balanced, was driven for the line. Joined by Mill Reef at the furlong pole everyone expected the latter to stride away but Geoff Lewis had to ride his Derby winner for all he was worth. He just hung on and won by a neck from Homeric. Mercer missed Homeric's run at Royal Ascot but next rode this colt to win the Prix Maurice de Nieuil, whereupon Homeric was transferred to Jack Cunnington in France. 1973 was a quieter year for Mercer after ’72. Boldboy announced his arrival on the racing scene by winning the Greenham Stakes as a maiden gelding and the Astor colt, Sharp Edge, who had won three races when ridden by Mercer as a 2yo in 1972, won him his first Irish 2000 Guineas after finishing third in the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket. Sharp Edge then went on to win the Prix Jean Prat in France. A new staying 3yo emerged in the shape of Buoy, whose owner Dick Hollingsworth had moved his horses to Dick Hern in 1972 (although they didn't run that season). Buoy picked up a good maiden at Newmarket before taking the Predominate Stakes Derby Trial at Goodwood. Sidestepping the Derby, he next appeared in the Irish Derby, running 3rd, before going to York and winning the Great Voltigeur Stakes. Buoy rounded of his first season when narrowly beaten in the St Leger. The stable jockey also rode Hollingsworth's other 3yo, Tepukei, to two wins, including the White Rose Stakes at Ascot. Mercer rode Sun Prince to win that colt's third consecutive Royal Ascot victory in the Queen Anne Stakes. Boldboy finished off his season with victories in the Prix de la Porte Maillot at Deauville, Diadem Stakes at Ascot and the Challenge Stakes at Newmarket. Mercer had another fine year in 1974 and the season really started with an Ascot 3yo maiden double on Pop Song and Gaily; the latter fulfilling the promise of her good runs as a 2yo. (She later went on to win the Irish 1000 Guineas (but ridden by Ron Hutchinson) and was then 3rd in the Irish Oaks when Mercer ridden). Newbury's Spring meeting saw Mercer picking up three winners, including a useful win on Tom Egerton's Final Chord, who went on to complete a hat-trick of wins at Chepstow and Royal Ascot (Britannia Stakes). In addition Appleby Fair, the stable's Derby hope, finished a good second in the Greenham Stakes. This was soon followed by the highly promising victory of the maiden Bustino in the Sandown Classic Trial. The 1,000 Guineas Stakes saw Mercer achieve every jockey's ambition when winning a classic for the reigning monarch. He rode the archetypal Mercer race hitting the front at the distance and trusting the speed, class or momentum of the horse kept him there. In this instance the horse was the Queen's own bred filly Highclere. Not particularly fancied she had form very near the best when placed as a 2yo. On her 2yo debut she had gone down narrowly to Polygamy. A few weeks later she was second again, this time to Celestial Dawn after getting a little lost in the early part of the race. Significantly in that race, receiving 4 pounds, she turned the tables on Polygamy and beat her 2 lengths. She did win her third race, a maiden at Newbury, but made such hard work of it that by the time of her lining up for 1000 she was relatively forgotten. Mercer came with his well-timed run and led going into the dip. Highclere's main pursuer, and old adversary, Polygamy was baulked in her run and struggled up the hill to catch Highclere. Fifty yards out Polygamy looked the likely winner but Mercer kept Highclere going to the line and the two fillies flashed by the post together. After some delay Highclere was named the short-head winner. Peter Willett in his biography of Dick Hern quotes the Bloodstock Breeders Review of that year:- \\"A dead heat might have done more justice to this epic struggle, but nothing could detract from Highclere's superb rugged performance, from Mercer's immaculate jockeyship, or from Dick Hern's magnificent training technique.\\" Six weeks later Mercer won his second classic on her when she won the Prix de Diane at Chantilly from a top class field of fillies. Highclere didn't win again but she did run a fine race against Dahlia when second in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. Appleby Fair failed to make up into a Derby colt and his place was taken at Epsom by what the stable had been considering their St Leger colt, namely Lady Beaverbrook's Bustino. He had won a second classic trial when comfortably winning the Lingfield Derby Trial. He lined up for the Epsom classic with what seemed like a real chance, but was horribly baulked at the top of the hill. He ran on very strongly but could only finish fourth to Snow Knight, a colt Bustino had already comfortably beaten twice in 1974. This was probably Mercer's best chance of winning the Derby. Afterwards Bustino proved his quality by giving Sagaro a good race when second to that good colt in the Grand Prix de Paris on softer going than suited him. He then thrashed the Irish Derby winner English Prince in the Great Voltigeur Stakes by 4 lengths. His season finished at Doncaster when Mercer and Jimmy Lindley, riding the same owner's Riboson, dominated the St. Leger. Mercer guided Bustino to victory with his pacemaker coming in third. Of the older horses Mercer rode Boldboy to a Lockinge Stakes victory, that gelding having already carried him to an Abernant Stakes victory. Buoy improved on his first season and as a 4yo blossomed into being a top middle distance colt with Mercer riding him in all his victories. After a second in the Jockey Club Stakes, he won the Yorkshire Cup and three weeks later followed this with the Coronation Cup at Epsom. Dahlia was odds-on to win this race but all 5 jockeys riding had instructions to come with a late run. After a ludicrous first furlong with the whole field dawdling along, Mercer took the lead but only at a moderate gallop. However going down towards Tattenham Corner he set Buoy alight such that entering the straight he was 10 lengths clear. By the final furlong he was dead beat but Mercer kept him going to the line to record a one and a half length victory over Tennyson. Buoy's final victory was in the Princess of Wales's Stakes at Newmarket when he beat Jupiter Pluvius in a workmanlike fashion. As regards 2yos two Sobell youngsters came to the fore. The first, Auction Ring, was ridden by Mercer to win a Newbury maiden, before appearing a month later to follow up in the July Stakes at Newmarket. Unfortunately he didn't win again in '74, but ran well to be placed in both the Gimcrack Stakes and the Middle Park Stakes. The second youngster was Bold Pirate and he again won two races, in his case his first and last, the latter being the Prix Roman at Longchamp. But he also was placed in both the Richmond Stakes and Champagne Stakes. 1975 started slowly for Mercer and at the end of April he had ridden only 5 winners, 3 of them for Peter Cundell plus a victory in the Earl of Sefton Stakes for Herbert Jones on Jimsun. Hern's stable was running plenty of horses (including Baronet (Craven Stakes), Harmonise (Free Handicap), Light Duty (Nell Gwyn Stakes) and School Bell (Princess Elizabeth Stakes) all ridden by Mercer) but not winning any and even Boldboy was only second in his opening race of the season. Mercer did not ride Hern's contender for the Fred Darling Stakes (Garden Party) and instead rode the Queen's filly Joking Apart for Ian Balding into 4th place. Bill Curling reports in his book ‘All the Queen's Horses’ that Irish trainer Stuart Murless (a great fan of Mercer's skills) was seeking Joe to ride his filly Nocturnal Spree in the season's first classic the 1000 Guineas. However Mercer stayed with Joking Apart and rode another finely judged race. He delivered his filly at the distance (just as the previous year on Highclere) and leading up the Rowley Mile hill was run out of it in the final 100 yards by the winner Nocturnal Spree, finally finishing third. On such a tough course Joking Apart probably did not stay the full 8 furlongs and she was confidently expected to return to her 2yo winning form in Royal Ascot's Jersey Stakes. Mercer had no luck in running but blamed himself for his filly's second place. Soon after he made amends when winning the Duchess of Montrose Handicap at Newmarket, and he rounded off her season when she won the 8 furlong Strensall Stakes over the easier York course. 1975 saw Mercer having an increased number of winners and rides for the stable of Ian Balding. The winners included the very useful 2yo filly Outer Circle, Mill Reef's sister Memory Lane and the useful handicapper Idiot's Delight. However, after the Guineas weekend (where Auction Ring failed in the 2000 Guineas) the Hern stable hit form and winners flowed for Mercer. A feature of the season was the two very good colts owned by Dick Hollingsworth. The first, Zimbalon, got off the mark in a Chester maiden in Mercer's hands. He won his next two races but (in these handicaps) was ridden by other jockeys. Mercer was reunited with him for his fourth victory on the trot. This was Royal Ascot's King George V Handicap and this victory rounded off a treble, all on the Thursday of the meeting. The second winner was Hollingsworth's Alcide colt Sea Anchor. This colt had got off the mark at Sandown when ridden by Mercer to win his maiden impressively. His next race, the King Edward VII Stakes, was a big step up in class but Sea Anchor was a commanding winner. The colt promised much and ran well in both the Irish Derby (4th to Grundy) and Great Voltigeur Stakes (2nd to Patch): however he didn't win again that year. The third winner of Mercer's Royal Ascot treble was Lord Porchester's hitherto unraced colt Smuggler. Despite being stoutly bred this Exbury colt romped away with the 6 furlong Chesham Stakes. This promising 2yo followed up with a comfortable victory in Newbury's 7 furlong Donnington Castle Stakes and was expected to complete a hat-trick in the Prix de la Salamandre. He ran unaccountably badly and was retired for the season. Hern was blessed with a number of stoutly bred 2yos. Right up with Smuggler was Lady Beaverbrook's Riboboy who Mercer rode to win his debut, the Plantation Maiden stakes, then Goodwood's Lanson Champagne Stakes before missing out at the third time of asking when 7th in the Laurent Perrier Champagne Stakes at Doncaster behind Wollow. Similarly useful was Sir Michael Sobell's colt Over to You who ridden both times by Mercer won the Yattendon Maiden at Newbury first time out and followed this up with a workmanlike victory in the Solario Stakes at Sandown. All useful colts they did not create the same stir that Lady Beaverbrook's Relkino did when he won his first race, the Echinswall Maiden Stakes, most impressively, Mercer ridden. His total eclipse when last in the Washington Singer Stakes was believed to be due to a slight virus going through the stable. The most remembered race of the year was the so-called 'Race of the Century' held at Ascot in July when Bustino was beaten half a length by the Derby winner Grundy in what many people consider to be one of the greatest races ever run. Bustino had been expected to start his season in the Yorkshire Cup in May. Declared for the race, Dick Hern was forced to withdraw the colt on the morning of the race because his owner, Lady Beaverbrook, did not want him to run in any thing but Group 1 races. Mercer took over the ride on what was to have been Bustino's pacemaker Riboson. Despite being on the effective second string Mercer scored a satisfying victory. Bustino appeared a few weeks later and again, with Riboson as his pacemaker, scored one of his finest victories when winning the Coronation Cup at Epsom in record time. This turned out to be Mercer's only Group 1 winner of the year. The follow-up was the Race of the Century (the 1975 King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes: covered under Bustino) in which Bustino ran with two pacemakers but not his classy, usual pacemaker Riboson, who was injured. Taking up the running earlier than usual, he entered the Ascot straight 4 lengths clear of that year's Derby winner Grundy, who in a thrilling finish beat Bustino by a half-length. To the outside world Mercer had much to look forward to with a promising group of horses for the 1976 classics. What was not known was that the stable owners, Sir Michael Sobell and Lord Arnold Weinstock, had informed Mercer that 1976 was to be his last as stable jockey and that he was to be replaced by Willie Carson. Both jockeys were sworn to secrecy and, apart from Hern, few others, including the bulk of the owners, knew of this arrangement. All came to the surface in early June 1976. Against this backdrop 1976 started well for Mercer and important early winners were Relkino in the Ascot 2000 Guineas Trial, Smuggler (Epsom's Warren Stakes), Memory Lane (Epsom's Princess Elizabeth Stakes) and Riboboy (Sandown's Classic Trial Stakes). Relkino then finished 6th in Wollow's 2000 Guineas victory, Smuggler followed up with a 3rd in the Chester Vase but Riboboy finished unplaced in the Lingfield Derby Trial. Mercer elected to ride Relkino in the Derby. Mercer was picking up several winners in May including twice on Zimbalon (Rosebery Handicap, Ormonde Stakes), Boldboy (Abernant Stakes) and two useful two-year-olds of Dick Hern's Town and Country and Sky Ship. On Derby Day Mercer had his fourth victory of the year on trainer John Nelson's Creetown. He also rode a fine race on Relkino in the Derby. He came with a perfectly timed run to win the race but was then easily brushed aside by the Lester Pigott ridden Empery, and left to finish second. As Relkino never won over further than ten furlongs (as a four- year-old he won the Lockinge Stakes and the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup), it is likely he didn't stay the distance of the Derby. The next day before racing, Mercer accompanied by Dick Hern and the Queen's racing manager, Lord Porchester, entered the Epsom Press Office. Porchester then read a prepared statement. It said that Mercer would be removed as stable jockey at the end of the season to be replaced by Willie Carson. The announcement created almost universal outcry from the press, Hern's other owners and others in racing. An almost immediate response from John Oaksey on ITV was, ‘The mind boggles if you are not satisfied with Joe Mercer’. There is little doubt that this announcement did harm to nearly everyone involved. Many felt Hern could have reacted differently, but Hern was just a salaried employer of the stable owners. However it did cause a chill between Hern and the Press that only thawed properly when he himself suffered a similar removal. Willie Carson was retained by Clive Brittain and to him it was a huge shock and his principal owner, Captain Marcos Lemos, said ‘ It was the way the whole wretched business was announced. I first heard the news on television. I still maintain I should have been told first’. Even three years later Weinstock said ‘…But I will admit that it was a painful thing, and in some quarters we have never been quite forgiven’. Within a week Mercer had bounced back and rode five winners at the Newbury Summer meeting, including two for Sobell and Weinstock (Adagio and Sunbelt). However at the same meeting he was found guilty of dangerous riding and received a weeks ban. At the same time he announced that he'd been approached by Ian Balding to become his stable jockey, and that he'd had similar offers that he was considering. Soon after this Mercer announced that he was to join Henry Cecil as stable jockey in 1977. At Royal Ascot Mercer managed only one winner in the shape of the Queen Mary Stakes winner Cramond for Ron Boss. Smuggler was Mercer's next best effort when he finished second in the King Edward VII Stakes. Six weeks later he rode this colt to win the Gordon Stakes at Goodwood. Sea Anchor could finish only third to the outstanding Sagaro in the Ascot Gold Cup. Sea Anchor had earlier won the Henry II Stakes at Sandown and had been fancied for the Ascot big staying race. This colt then went on to win the Goodwood Stakes, Mercer ridden, under the welter burden of 10 stone. Mercer later rode him to win the Doncaster Cup in September. Returning from his suspension of 7 days Mercer had a treble at the Newmarket July Meeting, of which the most significant winner was the July Stakes winner Sky Ship. This colt had already been ridden by Mercer to win a maiden at Salisbury and he followed this second win up with a win at Goodwood in the Lanson Champagne Stakes, during a fine meeting where he rode 5 winners. Other significant winners ridden for Hern were Bold Pirate, who won the John Smith's Magnet Cup; Boldboy, who as well as winning the Abernant Stakes, won the Sanyo Stakes at Doncaster; and the Queen's two-year-olds Fife and Drum and Circlet. For other trainers Mercer rode Gunner B (trained by George Toft) to win both the Cecil Frail Handicap and the Doonside Cup and John Cherry to win the Newbury Autumn Cup. Hern's best two-year-old was the maiden filly Dunfermline, who Mercer rode to be second to the Lester Piggott ridden Miss Pinkie in the Ascot Fillies Mile. It is instructive that while Piggott felt Dunfermline to be ingenuine and the to-be stable jockey Willie Carson considered other fillies in the stable to be more promising, Mercer felt the filly was just green and would improve as a 3yo. Mercer turned out to be right and Her Majesty's filly won three races the next year, including two classics. Mercer finished the season on 98 winners, his best total since 1965. Appropriately his last winner for Hern as stable jockey was the two-year-old filly Amity. Hern and Mercer remained friends for the rest of Hern's life. A group of Hern's owners presented him with a painting of his portrait surrounded by his classic winners as a leaving present. Henry Cecil was not only taking on a new stable-jockey in 1977, he was also moving to a new stable. Cecil's father-in-law Noel Murless had retired at the end of 1976 and he was taking over his Warren Place stable yard and most of his horses. He was not taking over the Murless trained Champion two-year-old of 1976 J. O. Tobin who was sent to finish his career in America. Although having been the British flat racing Champion Trainer of 1976 Cecil stated he had no champion horses in his stable for 1977. Mercer's first winner in 1977 was for Jeremy Hindley, who used Mercer when he was available (amongst his winning rides for Hindley in 1977 was the Royal Ascot winner, He Loves Me, in the Cork and Orrery Stakes: now the Golden Jubilee Stakes). On the final day of the Newmarket Craven meeting Mercer rode his first winner for his new stable when Habeebti won a small handicap for owner Charles St George. Later in the day he rode another winner for Cecil. The next day he rode another double for Cecil at Newbury. The second winner of this double was Royal Blend (again for Charles St George) who a month later followed up in the Predominate Stakes at Goodwood. Unfortunately the colt split a pastern in this race and was unable to race again that season. The Mercer/Cecil partnership was regularly notching winners but the first significant one was St George's four-year-old colt Lucky Wednesday who was a newcomer to Cecil's stable. After running placed in his first race at Newmarket he won his second race at Sandown in the Westbury Stakes (now the Gordon Richards Stakes). In this race Mercer had the pleasure of beating a Willie Carson ridden Relkino. Lucky Wednesday rapidly improved and went on to win the Clive Graham Stakes at Goodwood, followed by the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot. He was then beaten into second in the Eclipse Stakes by Artaius on very firm ground, which he disliked. Cecil felt he was never the same horse again after this run. Winners continued to flow but bigger wins were few and far between At Epsom Mercer rode Cecil's Royal Plume in the Derby: the colt had previously won the Dee Stakes at Chester. He did ride Cecil's first ever winner at the Derby meeting when Amboise won a sponsored handicap. Also at the Epsom meeting Mercer rode Gunner B to win the Diomed Stakes for George Toft. Mr Carlo d'Alessio's Aliante proved a useful handicapper winning two good handicaps. The first was the William Hill Gold Cup at Redcar (on a day Mercer rode a four-timer, including another winner for Cecil) and another at Sandown. The best three-year-old to come through was Mr Louis Freedman's Royal Hive, who ended up winning the Park Hill Stakes (under Mercer) at Doncaster, amongst her four wins. She also finished second in the Yorkshire Oaks and Prix Vermeille. Mercer eventually won 102 races in Britain, his first century since 1965. Despite the stable being short of big winners Cecil had numerically his second best season with 74 wins. 1978 saw a major improvement but the season started disappointingly with the complete failure of a horse called Brigata. This three-year-old filly was unraced as a two- year-old yet was strongly fancied for the One Thousand Guineas and was made favourite for her first race, the Nell Gwyn Stakes. She ran unaccountably badly and finished last, and a week later repeated the feat at Ascot in a further Guineas trial. The year did take off with the victory of Gunner B in the Earl of Sefton Stakes at Newmarket. This colt had been transferred by his owner to be trained by Cecil. It proved to be an inspired move as he improved in the hands of Mercer and Cecil to follow up this win with victories in the Brigadier Gerard Stakes, the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot and the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown. This five-year-old colt then ran second in the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup (now the Juddmonte International Stakes) to the Derby second, Hawaiian Sound. He returned to winning ways in the Valdoe Stakes at Goodwood, before ending his season with a third place in Newmarket's Champion Stakes. Aside from this, the season really got going for Mercer when he rode five winners in two days at Newmarket, all for his retained stable. None of them were big wins but included the stables’ first two-year-old winner in Mixed Applause and the three-year-old maiden winner Le Moss. This colt was having only his second run but went on to win his next two races, including the Queen's Vase at Royal Ascot in the hands of Geoff Baxter, as Mercer could not do the weight. When Mercer was reunited with the colt they won the March Stakes at Goodwood. Fancied for the St Leger he became fractious in the preliminaries to the final classic and according to Mercer took no interest in the race. Hit by another horse during the race he suddenly changed mood and finished a fast finishing second to the winner, Julio Mariner. Mixed Applause appeared a useful filly, and was ridden into second place in the Cherry Hinton Stakes by Mercer. She was then made favourite for the Waterford Candelabra Stakes at Goodwood but was soundly beaten by her stable companion Formulate (ridden by Muis Roberts). Mercer had already won a small maiden on Formulate, and after Goodwood went on to ride her to victory in both the May Hill Stakes and the Hoover Fillies' Mile. Formulate ended up Cecil's top rated 2yo that year. However the stable was endowed with a fine set of two-year-olds. An early winner at the end of May was Mr H J Joel's Mill Reef colt Main Reef. Mercer rode him to win his maiden debut at Sandown Park at the end of May, and then again to win the Chesham Stakes at Royal Ascot. He completed a quickfire hat-trick in early July when winning the July Stakes at Newmarket. He then took a break before reappearing at Newbury when winning the Mill Reef Stakes, later losing the race through disqualification. His season ended slightly disappointingly when beaten into fourth in the Middle Park Stakes. The next top two-year-old to come along was Lord Howard de Walden's colt Kris. Lord Howard had had horses both with Cecil and Murless, but up to this point the best horse Cecil had trained for him had been the gelding Fool's Mate, who was a tough handicapper. Kris took the relationship into another realm, but one could not have foretold this from Kris's early runs. Kris appeared first at Leicester in mid-June and won impressively at 6–1 on his 5furlong maiden debut. Although the press liked his performance, expectations were dampened when stable representative Paddy Rudkin said ‘we have plenty better at home’. His next race was chosen to be a maidens-at-closing race at Folkestone in early July, which he again won well. Kris then suffered a slight setback and was not seen out again until mid-October when with a lot of stable confidence he won the 6 furlong Rockingham Stakes at York, coming away powerfully from his field to win by an impressive 4 lengths. Twelve days later he finished off his season when winning the Horris Hill Stakes at Newbury. Not as dominant as in his previous races as Mercer had to give him a harder race, it did show he was improving with each race. The day after Kris won at Folkestone Mercer rode another fine colt on his debut at Yarmouth. This was Mr Carlo d'Alessio's Lyphard colt, Lyphard's Wish, and, odds on, he won this 7furlong maiden well. In mid-July he similarly won his follow-up race the Limekiln Stakes. His third victory was most impressive when he won the Solario Stakes in a course-record time. His season ended with two defeats in the Royal Lodge Stakes and William Hill Futurity that showed him to be just below the best juveniles of that year. Mercer had an embarrassment of riches, as this colt was soon followed by Mr Charles St. George's colt R B Chesne. Mercer missed this colt's debut victory as he was under suspension, but rode him in an impressive Washington Singer Stakes victory at Newbury. He again rode him at Doncaster when favourite for the Champagne Stakes. R B Chesne won, but while beating More Light (Hern/Carson), veered off a straight line and made his task more difficult. His final race was as favourite for the Dewhurst Stakes in which he was soundly beaten and finished a disappointing 5th to Tromos. St George was lucky to have another promising two-year-old colt, Borzoi, who created a strong impression when winning his second race at Newmarket. A new owner to the stable was Helena Springfield Limited who entered horseracing by purchasing three yearlings fillies at the 1977 Newmarket Sales. One was sent to be trained by Michael Stoute (Reprocolor)and the other two went into training with Cecil. Cecil's first runner for his new owner was Odeon, who finished second (ridden by Mercer) on her debut. Ridden by other jockeys, she then won her maiden before finishing second in the Hoover Fillies Mile to the Mercer ridden Formulate. In the same ownership, One in a Million was ridden in both her races by Mercer. She appeared at the end of September in the Blue Seal Stakes, which she won impressively. She then stepped up further when winning the Houghton Stakes at Newmarket, convincingly beating the highly rated, Hern trained colt Milford. In midsummer Cecil's stable was endowed with a further owner under more peculiar circumstances. Mr Daniel Wildenstein, a rich Paris art dealer, had owned horses for many years and had won the 1976 One Thousand Guineas with Flying Water and the Oaks with Pawneese, both trained in France by Angel Penna. Penna had decided to retire and return to Argentina, and some horses were sent to be trained in England by Peter Walwyn. Some success was gained and more were sent in 1978, amongst them Wildenstein's prized stayer Buckskin. All seemed well but at that year's Royal Ascot Buckskin was well beaten by Shangamuzo in the Ascot Gold Cup. In the unsaddling enclosure Wildenstein complained about jockey Pat Eddery's riding of the horse and an argument ensued the result of which was that Walwyn asked Wildenstein to remove his horses from his stable. A few weeks later the announcement was made that these horses would be joining Cecil's Warrren Place string. Mercer and Cecil's first runner and first winner for Wildenstein was the five-year-old horse Malecite, who won the Winter Hill Stakes at Windsor. This victory was swiftly followed by Southern Seas winning her maiden at Yarmouth: this three-year-old filly went on to win four races all ridden by Mercer. Many other races were won, none more important than Buckskin's victory in the Doncaster Cup. He followed up this victory with a sparkling victory in Jockey Club Cup at Newmarket. In both these victories Mercer chose to lead on this difficult to train five-year-old. Despite not winning a classic race Henry Cecil regained the leading trainer title and won more races than any previous season, and Mercer rode 115 winners, his highest ever total for a British Flat Season. 1979 was no different from previous seasons and Mercer arrived at the season's first big meeting (Newmarket Craven Meeting) having ridden only three winners for long time stalwarts Harry Wragg, Jeremy Hindley and Peter Walwyn. The first day of this meeting was to see Cecil have his first runners. Mercer rode a treble on the first day, the most significant of which was Lyphard's Wish in the Craven Stakes. Pitted against the Two Thousand Guineas favourite (and the previous year's top two-year-old), Tromos, Mercer's mount was second favourite at 11–2. In a small field of three Mercer took the lead from the start and that there was to be an upset was never in doubt: Tromos the odds-on 30-100 favourite was beaten decisively by two and a half lengths. Later in the afternoon Mercer had another winner for Cecil, when Chalet won a handicap with top weight. The jockey's afternoon finished with a last gasp victory on Romara for Harry Wragg beating a hot favourite in Reprocolor (Helena Springfield's filly with Michael Stoute). The next day Cecil introduced Welsh Chanter in the Wood Ditton Stakes (a race for hitherto unraced three-year-olds). Mercer thus rode his fourth winner of the meeting, and this colt later gave him a Royal Ascot winner in June, when winning the Britannia Stakes for his owner Jim Joel. Mercer's fifth winner of the meeting was One in a Million in the Nell Gwyn Stakes. Taking on the One Thousand Guineas favourite, Devon Ditty, she was made favourite and easily repaid her supporters with a most impressive victory. She immediately became the new Guineas favourite. One in a Million went on to win the Thousand Guineas in a race where Mercer took full control of the race by using his filly's speed to open up a large lead three furlongs out. As she tired coming up the final hill her lead was diminishing but this tactic enabled her to hold on by a length. The filly ran later at Royal Ascot and won the Coronation Stakes, but only on the disqualification of Buz Kashi. Her career ended when she could finish only third in the July Cup. Following the Craven meeting, the stable then went to Newbury where Mercer rode two Wildenstein horses to win their maidens. But the highlight of a strong week for the stable was the seasonal debut of Kris in the Greenham Stakes. Mercer rode his typical race bringing Kris to hit the front at the distance. He then was strongly challenged by Young Generation who appeared certain to beat Kris. However this colt was not finished and he reasserted himself in the last hundred yards to win an exciting race by half a length. Soon after the race it was announced that Mercer was to ride Lord Howard de Walden's colt in the Two Thousand Guineas and the ride on Lyphard's Wish was to go to Yves Saint-Martin. What wasn't known was that Kris had overstretched and injured himself in the race and had to be handled carefully in order to be fit for his classic race. Kris started as favourite for the Two Thousand Guineas and nearest to him in the betting were joint second favourites Young Generation and Kris's stable companion Lyphard's Wish. Mercer had chosen the right horse and the race seemed at his mercy with a furlong to go as he loomed up to challenge the leader Tap on Wood. But Kris did not fire as he did at Newbury and Tap on Wood held on to win by half a length with Young Generation only a short-head behind Kris. Disappointed by this defeat Cecil felt Kris needed more experience and he was given an easy race at Kempton when Mercer rode him to win the Heron Stakes. At Royal Ascot Young Generation was expected to beat Kris and so started favourite for the St James Palace Stakes. Kris started as second favourite but now showed his true worth and confidently ridden by Mercer beat his old rival decisively by one and a half lengths. Ridden by Mercer Kris remained supreme amongst milers for the rest of the season winning the Sussex Stakes, Waterford Candelabra Stakes (Goodwood Mile), Queen Elizabeth II Stakes and finally the Challenge Stakes. Kris was the third of Mercer's four Royal Ascot winners. The fourth was the Jeremy Hindley trained Rollahead who won the Windsor Castle Stakes. Cecil also had four winners but his fourth was a bitter-sweet victory in the Ascot Gold Cup involving the Daniel Wildenstein colt Buckskin. This six-year-old had reappeared on a wet day at Sandown in May and on the perfect (for him) going of soft ground had won the Henry II Stakes easily by 15 lengths. It was an impressive performance and despite an encouraging first win of the year on Le Moss Mercer chose to ride Buckskin in the Gold Cup (Lester Piggott took over from Mercer on Le Moss). For all of the race Buckskin was stalked by Le Moss but on the firmer ground was unable to shake off his younger stablemate. Coming into the straight Buckskin took over the lead but soon after Le Moss drew upsides and after a short battle Mercer accepted the situation and allowed Buckskin to come home 5 lengths ahead of Araphos (who was third), but 7 lengths behind Le Moss. For Cecil (who was visibly upset for his gallant horse) and Mercer the wrong horse had won. Buckskin was retired after this race. Le Moss went on to take the Stayer's Triple Crown when back in the hands of Mercer he won both the Goodwood Cup and Doncaster Cup. Lyphard's Wish came out of his Two Thousand Guineas race well and re-united with Mercer led almost all the way to win the Dante Stakes at York. He was then to be aimed at the Derby. Mercer had already won the Lingfield Derby Trial on Milford (owned by the Queen) for Dick Hern, when he deputised for an injured Willie Carson. Piggott eventually took the ride on Milford in the Derby who was joint third favourite and preferred in the market to Lyphard's Wish. As it was Mercer was to lead most of the way in this 200th Derby, but his colt's stamina ran out at the 10 furlong pole and he gave way to Dickens Hill who eventually finished 4 lengths in front of the 5th finishing Mercer mount. But the whole field was massacred by Dick Hern's Troy as the Willie Carson ridden colt beat his field by 7 lengths. Milford finished unplaced as he did when Mercer ridden in the St Leger later in the year. Although Lyphard's continued to run well in a number of Group 1 races he failed to add to his score. Mercer did ride him to be placed in three Group 1 races; the Prince of Wales Stakes, Benson and Hedges Gold Cup and Prix du Moulin. Following Royal Ascot Mercer had a successful July in which he rode 29 winners, 16 of them for his retained stable. A feature of this hit-rate was five doubles and three trebles. In terms of big wins it was a lesser month and his biggest win was on Rollahead in the National Stakes. The biggest disappointment of the month was the total eclipse of Borzoi in the Eclipse. Mr Charles St George's colt had only reappeared in early June when he won the John of Gaunt Stakes under jockey Taffy Thomas. Reunited with Mercer he was strongly fancied for Royal Ascot's Jersey Stakes. His final race was a dismal effort in the Eclipse. St George did not have much luck with his older horses as R B Chesne was badly ill early in the year and appeared only once when second at Doncaster in September. Another 3yo to take his time to find his feet was Jim Joel's Main Reef. Seen as the stables’ leading Derby horse he ran a disappointing couple of races early in the season in the Blue Riband Stakes at Epsom and then the Dee Stakes at Chester. However given a rest over the summer he reappeared in the Autumn and Mercer rode him to win the Crown of Crown Stakes at Goodwood followed by the Cumberland Lodge Stakes at Ascot. If July was a strong month August was stronger and started with the important Goodwood Festival. Mercer rode seven winners and as well as the aforementioned victories on Le Moss and Kris, his most important success was on Connaught Bridge who won the Nassau Stakes. This filly had seemed well exposed as a two-year-old when she won twice at small meetings. Shed did not come to hand early as a three-year-old and missed the fillies classics. She eventually reappeared in early July running 3rd under jockey John Higgins. She then stepped up in class for this Nassau victory when ridden by Mercer to beat her stable companion Odeon (ridden by Piggott). Connaught Bridge next took the Yorkshire Oaks when Mercer rode her to a three length victory over Senorita Poquito and Reprocolor. She finished off her year with a storming victory in the Twickenham Fillies Stakes at Kempton, again Mercer ridden. The leading filly at the start of the season had been Wildenstein's Li'Ile du Reve. This filly was beautifully bred being out of the Oaks winner Lupe. Unraced as a two-year-old she won her debut maiden and then easily scored in the Cheshire Oaks and was made favourite for The Oaks in which she was easily beaten. Although she ran again she could not be compared to Connaught Bridge or Odeon amongst the staying fillies in the stable. On the same day that Kris won the Sussex Stakes, Mercer rode Jim Joel's The Solent to win the Goodwood Stakes (his third win of the season on this staying handicapper). The day after The Solent's win Mercer took the Lanson Champagne Stakes on Mr Louis Freedman's Marathon Gold, who at that time appeared the best two-year-old in the yard having won his first race convincingly at Ascot. As it was he was to disappoint thereafter and was replaced by more consistent and promising colts in the stable. Mercer drew a blank on the Friday of Goodwood but finished the meeting with a treble on the aforementioned Connaught Bridge, Suavity (an early 2yo colt who was winning his third race from three starts) and Tahitian King. Richard Baerlein in the Guardian commented on the Monday after Goodwood that \\"It certainly be a wonderful feat if at the age of 44, Joe Mercer could win his first jockey championship. I fear with his lowest riding weight of it is simply not on unless Carson and Eddery are sidelined through accidents. At present Mercer leads with 86 winners from Carson with 82 and Eddery with 75\\". By the end of the month he had ridden 31 winners in the month and 109 thus far for the season: a long way ahead of his previous scoring rate (even 1967). His chief pursuers were champion Willie Carson and Pat Eddery but Mercer's ten doubles and one treble in August kept Carson 10 to 20 winners behind. Important wins in the month (after Goodwood) were Piaffer (Rose of York Handicap), Odeon (Galtres Stakes), Connaught Bridge and Kris. In addition a promising two-year-old in the shape of Charles St George's Ginistrelli appeared at Yarmouth to win comfortably on his debut. Mercer missed this colt's second win a few weeks later as he was riding at another meeting. Although he couldn't keep up this run-rate in September he still had 24 winners. At this time Cecil's stable was hit by the virus as reported by Mercer to Jonathan Powell in an article in the News of the World. This happened at a time Cecil was revealing his two-year-olds and trying himself to win the Trainer's Championship. He took steps to quarantine the sick horses. Despite this Mercer had a brilliant spell mid-September when he won 8 races in three days; these included the consistent Volcanic (his third win), Le Moss (Doncaster Cup), Nocino (a 2yo of Daniel Wildesteins's in the Rous Nursery Handicap: Mercer's third win on this colt) and Kashmir Lass (a Louis Freedman 2yo) as well as winning rides for Bill Wightman, William Hastings-Bass and Charles Nelson. By the end of the Doncaster St Leger meeting Mercer was 3–1 on to win his first jockey championship. The month ended with another treble at Ascot when as well as winning on Kris, he took the Royal Lodge Stakes on Daniel Wildenstein's colt Hello Gorgeous and the Blue Seal Stakes (for the second year) on Lord Howard de Walden's promising filly Evita. A feature of October was the number of wins on promising 2yo's. Although Super Asset was second first time out in September this Charles St. George hose won 3 races in quick succession, including the important Hyperion Stakes and the even more important Horris Hill Stakes. Such was the impression this Sir Ivor colt made he was rated second only (one pound below) to the Dewhurst winner Monteverdi in the Two Year old Handicap for 1979. Hello Gorgeous was rated only two pounds lower after winning his final race the William Hill Futurity (previously the Timeform or Observer Gold Cup). This important win gave Mercer his 155th winner of the season. Another interesting colt to make his debut in the month was Jim Joel's Light Cavalry who provided Mercer with his 150th winner. October was such a strong month in which Mercer rode 25 winners including 5 doubles, one treble and one four-timer. In the article with Powell Mercer mentioned that he had never phoned around for rides, and even in pursuing his first title he had refused to but that many trainers were calling him. As he said \\"just recently a number of people I don’t normally ride for have been offering me mounts and \\"so many people have said they’d like to see me do it\\". In September and October Mercer rode winners for Cecil (27), Hindley (3), Reg Akehurst (1), Jeremy Tree (2), Mick Musson (1), Bill Wightman (2), Ron Smyth (1), William Hastings-Bass (1), Charles Nelson (2), Denys Smith (1), Neil Adam (1), Scobie Breasley (2), John Sutcliffe (2), John Tierney (1), Ryan Jarvis (1) and Andy Turnell (1). Mercer did not slacken off right up to the end of the season. He only rode 6 winners in November but that was enough. He finished with doubles on the penultimate and final days of the season for his retained stable of Henry Cecil. Cecil finished Champion Trainer with a record of 128 winners and winnings of £683,971. Mercer finished with 164 winners beating his nearest rival Willie Carson by 22 winners. His percentage of winners to rides was a formidable 26.97%, so that he beat Carson who had 212 more rides than he did. Mercer was not the oldest winner, Richards had won at 48 and Scobie Breasley at 51, but he was the oldest first-time winner. In the New Year's Honours List, he was awarded an OBE. 1980s Numerically Mercer had his sixth best season in 1980 with 104 winners, but he slipped to fifth in that year's jockeys' table. However the season started well as usual at the Newmarket and Newbury Spring meetings. Biggest winner of the week was Evita, who won the accepted trial for the One Thousand Guineas, the Nell Gwynn Stakes. The Cecil stable was in a similar position to 1978 and had an unraced filly who was being touted as their best filly. Unlike Brigata, the Daniel Wildenstein owned Saison appeared at Newbury and won her maiden authoritatively, immediately being installed as favourite for the One Thousand Guineas, with Mercer to ride her (Pat Eddery took the ride on Evita). When it came to the big race itself, both fillies failed behind the winner, Quick as Lightning, and both failed to win again. Cecil had no runner in the Two Thousand Guineas as the trialled colts failed to distinguish themselves and so on the day of that race was at Haydock to give Kris his seasonal debut in a relatively small race. Kris won his follow-up race, the Lockinge Stakes, at Newbury but soon after was injured and did not reappear again until early September when he won a small race at Goodwood. His final race, the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes, was a few weeks later and Kris had by then become difficult to train and difficult at the stalls. Covered in sweat he went down by a neck to that year's Two Thousand Guineas winner, Known Fact. His injury had caused him to miss all his midsummer races and meant that he didn't ever run over ten furlongs, which had been the aim of his third season in training. Mercer again won the Dante Stakes, this time aboard Hello Gorgeous who went on to represent Mercer/Cecil in the Derby. Cecil's other Derby colt, Ginistrelli, had appeared in the Sandown Classic Trial in April and had won that race for Mercer. His next race was the Lingfield Derby Trial, in which he was totally eclipsed and didn't run again. Hello Gorgeous ran a similar race to the previous year's Derby runner Lyphard's Wish and faded in the last two furlongs. He was a good second in his next race, the Eclipse Stakes, to Ela- Mana-Mou but did not win again. A more progressive colt was Light Cavalry, who won a handicap at Newbury mid-May, and then went on to win the King Edward VII Stakes at Royal Ascot. This was one of four Mercer victories at the Royal Meeting as he also won the Queen Mary Stakes on the speedy, Cecil trained Pushy (this filly later won the Cornwallis Stakes with Mercer riding) and the Ascot Gold Cup on Le Moss. Le Moss was also proving difficult to train and it was difficult to get him to exert himself on the gallops. There was no such problem in the race where Mercer took up the running a long way out and held off the strongly fancied Irish colt Ardross. For the second year running Le Moss completed the Stayer's Triple Crown beating Ardross in both the Goodwood Cup and the Doncaster Cup, despite having to give Ardross, the next year's Ascot Gold Cup winner and Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe second, weight in both races. Mercer completed a four-timer at Royal Ascot with his victory on John Sutcliffe's Tender Heart in the Royal Hunt Cup. By mid-summer rumours as to who would ride for whom the following season were rife. It had been made known that Lester Piggott was severing his partnership with the Sangster- Magnier Vincent O’Brien stable at Ballydoyle and also Mercer had been told that Pat Eddery (Peter Walwyn's stable jockey) had been approached by representatives of Cecil's stable as to his availability the next season. Mercer met with Walwyn at a function at Walwyn's stable and said that he already knew that he would not be riding for one owner (Charles St. George) in 1981 and inquired as to Walwyn's plans as given that situation he would be willing to become Walwyn's stable jockey if he needed one. The result of all this was a switch round of stable jockeys in early September with Eddery becoming Vincent O’Brien's stable jockey, Piggott becoming Cecil's and Mercer at last becoming Peter Walwyn's. Walwyn had always expressed the opinion that Mercer was his ‘beau ideal’ as a stable jockey. The announcement of this was made at the Doncaster St Leger meeting where Mercer rode St. George's Gielgud to victory in the Champagne Stakes. This colt was not Cecil's only good two-year-old colt as he had had Mercer also win the July Stakes on Age Quod Aegis for Wildenstein in July. On the Saturday of the Doncaster meeting Mercer chose to blunt the speed of his main rival Water Mill (Carson/Hern) in the St. Leger Stakes by leading from the start and ultimately winning the final classic by 4 lengths on Jim Joel's Light Cavalry. In 1981 the strength of Peter Walwyn's stable could not compare with the powerful stable of the early-to-mid-1970s. Ravaged by the virus from 1978 onwards he had both lost owners and become second choice for others. Owners such as Stavros Niarchos had taken horses away from Walwyn at the end of 1979 (including Nureyev), while Louis Freedman and Lord Howard de Walden, who seemed to favour Walwyn earlier in the 1970s, now preferred to send their better animals to Henry Cecil. Walwyn did not have the calibre of horse of earlier years and won only one Group race in 1981 when Travel On won the Cherry Hinton Stakes at the Newmarket July meeting. Mercer's only other big winner for Walwyn was Halsbury, who Mercer rode to win the Cesarawitch Handicap at the end of the season. Mercer had only 64 winning rides, but 1981 was not a complete write-off for Mercer. He benefitted from the misfortune of Willie Carson, who fractured his skull in a fall at the York August meeting. With no stable jockey Hern used several jockeys as replacements for Carson and often used Mercer. Although Mercer did not ride the Queen's Height of Fashion in her first race, when winning the Acomb Stakes at York (Piggott rode), he did ride her in her two other, both winning, runs: the last of which was the Fillies Mile at Ascot. Her second victory was in the May Hill Stakes at Doncaster and this formed the second leg of a memorable double. Earlier on the card Mercer rode the Sir John Astor owned Cut Above in the St. Leger for Hern. This was being treated as Hern's second string as Lester Piggott was riding Lady Beaverbrook's colt Bustomi, who was a shorter price. However the odds on favourite was the dual Derby winner Shergar who was confidently expected to take his second British Classic. On his 28-1 shot Mercer wound up a long run from four furlongs out and in the final furlong came away from his field with Gold and Ivory second, Bustomi third and the disappointing favourite Shergar a well-beaten fourth. Mercer also rode the Sobell/Weinstock colt Prince Bee for Hern to win the Valdoe Stakes at Goodwood and preferred this colt to Cut Above when Hern sent the two colts unsuccessfully for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. The following season was again tough for Mercer and other than winning the Cambridgeshire Handicap for Luca Cumani on Century City he had few winners of note and rode only 58 winners in the season. He did however look to have a fine chance of winning the Derby. Pat Eddery rode Jeremy Tree's Peacetime to win the Sandown Classic Trial. The colt had had breathing problems and an operation had seemed to cure those as he won well. As Eddery would ride for the O’Brien stable in the Derby, Mercer was engaged to take over and the partnership smoothly won the Predominate Stakes at Goodwood beating Touching Wood. In the Derby Mercer rode the classic race being in the first 4 coming into the straight and travelling as well as any other horse. However, when the pressure was applied Peacetime folded as if the breathing problems had returned. He was unplaced behind Golden Fleece with Touching Wood second. 1983 was a more interesting year and could have been even more important. Mid-season Mercer broke his own rule of not telephoning trainers to enquire as to possibility of a ride. Having been ‘jocked off’ earlier in his career he had stuck to this principle. The circumstances were that Billy Newnes the stable jockey to Derrick Candy's son Henry's stable had been injured on the gallops and was unable to ride the previous year's Oaks winner Time Charter in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot. Urged by his wife Mercer rang Henry Candy and was reunited with the Kingstone Warren stable. Mercer rode a perfect race on the filly and won his second King George from Diamond Shoal. Later in the season he was to benefit from a dispute between Lester Piggott and Daniel Wildenstein. Wildenstein had been unhappy with Piggott's riding of his two- year-old colt Vacarme in the Richmond Stakes. Later when Piggott turned down the ride on his filly All Along (trained by Patrick Biancone) in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe he decided Piggott would never ride for him again. Mercer was offered the ride on All Along but turned it down as he had already been retained by Dick Hern to ride Sun Princess's pacemaker Sailor's Dance (Sobell/Weinstock). The ride went to Walter Swinburn who went on to win the Arc and three other Grade 1 races in North America on All Along. Despite this Wildenstein was impressed with Mercer's loyalty and Mercer rode most of the horses Cecil trained for Wildenstein for the rest of the season. Mercer rode the favourite Vacarme in the Middle Park Stakes but the colt was only a disappointing third. He did however ride the same owner's Legend of France to win the Joel Stakes. By now Mercer was often riding for Charles Nelson and rode a very promising filly called Mahogany to win the Rockfel Stakes, who became strongly fancied for the next year's One Thousand Guineas. This and Time Charter's win helped to make up for the low number of winners, 55, he rode that year. The Spring Meeting week of 1984 was almost as it used to be and Mercer won the two main classic trials at Newbury when Mahogany won the Fred Darling Stakes and the same trainer's Creag an Sgor won the Greenham Stakes. Mahogany was made favourite for the One Thousand Guineas. Prominent for a long way in the big race she then faded badly as if there was something wrong with her. Creag an Sgor was outclassed in the Two Thousand Guineas. Mercer retained the Wildenstein rides with Cecil and again won on Legend of France (Earl of Sefton Stakes). Soon after Mercer rode this colt as favourite at Royal Ascot and after a disappointing run there was an argument between Cecil and Wildenstein. Soon after Wildenstein removed his horses from Cecil's yard. The rides therefore dried up for Cecil. Mercer did reunite with Time Charter again but compared with the last year the results were not as positive. Billy Newnes had been suspended for the season and so Mercer was retained again, but before the filly's first race of the season he himself picked up a suspension and so missed both Time Charter's victory in the Coronation Cup at Epsom as well as his ride in the Epsom Derby, severing a run of more than 30 consecutive rides in the Epsom classic. Time Charter's next race was the Eclipse Stakes for which she was favourite. Mercer held up the filly for her late finish but did not get a clear run and finished a fast finishing second to Sadler's Wells. He received some criticism for this performance but retained the ride on Time Charter for the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. Time Charter was fifth behind Teenoso in this race and Mercer was not asked to ride her again in her remaining (unsuccessful) races. On King George day Mercer did have an interesting winner when Peter Walwyn's, two-year-old debutant, Khozaam won the Granville Stakes in impressive style. He followed this up with an equally impressive victory in the Washington Singer Stakes at Newbury. Khozaam finished off his season with a close second to Reach in the Royal Lodge Stakes, despite being hit over the head by Reach's jockey's whip. Mercer rode 49 winners in 1984. Popular sentiment was that Mercer was continuing to ride because of the chance of Khozaam in the 1985 Derby, but the idea of this horse achieving that feat was soon erased as Khozaam ran poorly in the Blue Riband Stakes at Epsom in April. He failed again in the Lingfield Derby Trial and had not trained on and was a failure as a three-year-old. It was no surprise when Mercer decided to announce his retirement from the saddle in the middle of the Goodwood summer meeting. Mercer did ride several good winners in his last year, the most important of which were Walwyn two-year-olds. The best was Stalker who was consistent all year and won both the Gimcrack Stakes and the Middle Park Stakes, as well as two other races. This was Walwyn's first Group One victory since the late 70s. There was also a slower to mature two-year-old called Luqman, who Mercer rode to win four races, although he missed his biggest day when Luqman won the Mill Reef Stakes at Newbury, with Stalker (Mercer aboard) coming second. For Charles Nelson Mercer rode his only Royal Ascot winner on another two-year-old Marouble in the Norfolk Stakes. The final day of the 1985 season was at Doncaster and this was to be Mercer's farewell to UK flat racing. Although he had a few rides his best chance of a win was presented to him by Jeremy Hindley and Michael Hills. Hills was to ride the favourite in a two-year-old race called Comme l'Etoile for his stable, but elected to step aside so Mercer could have a chance of riding a final winner for a stable he'd been long associated with. Mercer duly won on Comme l'Etoile and this seemed a perfect ending. Except that later on the card he rode a relatively unfancied colt called Bold Rex in the Manchester November Handicap. In very soft going Mercer kept this John Dunlop trained colt towards the rear but steered him up the centre of the course to win a final big victory. The horse and jockey were cheered loudly all the way from the course to the unsaddling enclosure. Legacy Mercer's career total of 2,810 winners was exceeded only by Sir Gordon Richards, Lester Piggott, and Doug Smith at the time of his retirement, and subsequently only bettered by Pat Eddery (his niece's ex-husband), Willie Carson and Frankie Dettori. Shortly after his retirement, he was the subject of a biography by Richard Baerlein: Joe Mercer The Pictorial Biography Queen Ann Press (1987). Personal life Mercer is married to Deanna Anne Carr, the daughter of jockey Harry Carr. His older brother, Manny Mercer, was also a jockey and died in a racing accident in 1959. His niece, Carolyn, was married to jockey Pat Eddery.

For most dating requirements it has been superseded by uranium–lead dating (U–Pb dating), but in certain specialized situations (such as dating meteorites and the age of the Earth) it is more important than U–Pb dating. Decay equations for common Pb–Pb dating There are three stable \\"daughter\\" Pb isotopes that result from the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium in nature; they are 206Pb, 207Pb, and 208Pb. 204Pb is the only non-radiogenic lead isotope, therefore is not one of the daughter isotopes. These daughter isotopes are the final decay products of U and Th radioactive decay chains beginning from 238U, 235U and 232Th respectively. With the progress of time, the final decay product accumulates as the parent isotope decays at a constant rate. This shifts the ratio of radiogenic Pb versus non-radiogenic 204Pb (207Pb/204Pb or 206Pb/204Pb) in favor of radiogenic 207Pb or 206Pb. This can be expressed by the following decay equations: :: {\\\\left(\\\\frac\\\\ce{^{207}Pb}\\\\ce{^{204}Pb}\\\\right)_{P}} = {\\\\left(\\\\frac\\\\ce{^{207}Pb}\\\\ce{^{204}Pb}\\\\right)_{I}} + {\\\\left(\\\\frac\\\\ce{^{235}U}\\\\ce{^{204}Pb}\\\\right)_{P}} {\\\\left({e^{\\\\lambda_{235}t}-1}\\\\right)} :: {\\\\left(\\\\frac\\\\ce{^{206}Pb}\\\\ce{^{204}Pb}\\\\right)_{P}} = {\\\\left(\\\\frac\\\\ce{^{206}Pb}\\\\ce{^{204}Pb}\\\\right)_{I}} + {\\\\left(\\\\frac\\\\ce{^{238}U}\\\\ce{^{204}Pb}\\\\right)_{P}} {\\\\left({e^{\\\\lambda_{238}t}-1}\\\\right)} where the subscripts P and I refer to present-day and initial Pb isotope ratios, λ235 and λ238 are decay constants for 235U and 238U, and t is the age. The concept of common Pb–Pb dating (also referred to as whole rock lead isotope dating) was deduced through mathematical manipulation of the above equations. It was established by dividing the first equation above by the second, under the assumption that the U/Pb system was undisturbed. This rearranged equation formed: :: \\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\left(\\\\frac\\\\ce{^{207}Pb}\\\\ce{^{204}Pb}\\\\right)_{P}-\\\\left(\\\\frac\\\\ce{^{207}Pb}\\\\ce{^{204}Pb}\\\\right)_{I}}{\\\\left(\\\\frac\\\\ce{^{206}Pb}\\\\ce{^{204}Pb}\\\\right)_{P}-\\\\left(\\\\frac\\\\ce{^{206}Pb}\\\\ce{^{204}Pb}\\\\right)_{I}}\\\\right]= {\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{137.88}\\\\right)}{\\\\left(\\\\frac{e^{\\\\lambda_{235}t}-1}{e^{\\\\lambda_{238}t}-1}\\\\right)} where the factor of 137.88 is the present-day 238U/235U ratio. As evident by the equation, initial Pb isotope ratios, as well as the age of the system are the two factors which determine the present day Pb isotope compositions. If the sample behaved as a closed system then graphing the difference between the present and initial ratios of 207Pb/204Pb versus 206Pb/204Pb should produce a straight line. The distance the point moves along this line is dependent on the U/Pb ratio, whereas the slope of the line depends on the time since Earth's formation. This was first established by Nier et al., 1941. The formation of the Geochron The development of the Geochron was mainly attributed to Clair Cameron Patterson’s application of Pb-Pb dating on meteorites in 1956. The Pb ratios of three stony and two iron meteorites were measured. The dating of meteorites would then help Patterson in determining not only the age of these meteorites but also the age of Earth's formation. By dating meteorites Patterson was directly dating the age of various planetesimals. Assuming the process of elemental differentiation is identical on Earth as it is on other planets, the core of these planetesimals would be depleted of uranium and thorium, while the crust and mantle would contain higher U/Pb ratios. As planetesimals collided, various fragments were scattered and produced meteorites. Iron meteorites were identified as pieces of the core, while stony meteorites were segments of the mantle and crustal units of these various planetesimals. Image:Canyon-diablo-meteorite.jpgIron meteorite found in Canyon Diablo Image:Barringer Crater aerial photo by USGS.jpgMeteorite impact Isochron.JPGFigure 1. Pb–Pb isochron diagram Samples of iron meteorite from Canyon Diablo (Meteor Crater) Arizona were found to have the least radiogenic composition of any material in the solar system. The U/Pb ratio was so low that no radiogenic decay was detected in the isotopic composition. As illustrated in figure 1, this point defines the lower (left) end of the isochron. Therefore, troilite found in Canyon Diablo represents the primeval lead isotope composition of the solar system, dating back to 4.55 +/- 0.07 Byr. Stony meteorites however, exhibited very high 207Pb/204Pb versus 206Pb/204Pb ratios, indicating that these samples came from the crust or mantle of the planetesimal. Together, these samples define an isochron, whose slope gives the age of meteorites as 4.55 Byr. Patterson also analyzed terrestrial sediment collected from the ocean floor, which was believed to be representative of the Bulk Earth composition. Because the isotope composition of this sample plotted on the meteorite isochron, it suggested that earth had the same age and origin as meteorites, therefore solving the age of the Earth and giving rise to the name 'geochron'. Image:Paterson isochron animation.gif Lead isotope isochron diagram used by C. C. Patterson to determine the age of the Earth in 1956. Animation shows progressive growth over 4550 million years (Myr) of the lead isotope ratios for two stony meteorites (Nuevo Laredo and Forest City) from initial lead isotope ratios matching those of the Canyon Diablo iron meteorite. Precise Pb–Pb dating of meteorites Pb–Pb isochrons for the oldest known material in the solar system. Chondrules and calcium–aluminium-rich inclusions (CAIs) are spherical particles that make up chondritic meteorites and are believed to be the oldest objects in the solar system. Hence precise dating of these objects is important to constrain the early evolution of the solar system and the age of the earth. The U–Pb dating method can yield the most precise ages for early solar-system objects due to the optimal half-life of 238U. However, the absence of zircon or other uranium-rich minerals in chondrites, and the presence of initial non-radiogenic Pb (common Pb), rules out direct use of the U-Pb concordia method. Therefore, the most precise dating method for these meteorites is the Pb–Pb method, which allows a correction for common Pb. When the abundance of 204Pb is relatively low, this isotope has larger measurement errors than the other Pb isotopes, leading to very strong correlation of errors between the measured ratios. This makes it difficult to determine the analytical uncertainty on the age. To avoid this problem, researchers developed an 'alternative Pb–Pb isochron diagram' (see figure) with reduced error correlation between the measured ratios. In this diagram the 204Pb/206Pb ratio (the reciprocal of the normal ratio) is plotted on the x-axis, so that a point on the y axis (zero 204Pb/206Pb) would have infinitely radiogenic Pb. The ratio plotted on this axis is the 207Pb/206Pb ratio, corresponding to the slope of a normal Pb/Pb isochron, which yields the age. The most accurate ages are produced by samples near the y-axis, which was achieved by step-wise leaching and analysis of the samples. Previously, when applying the alternative Pb–Pb isochron diagram, the 238U/235U isotope ratios were assumed to be invariant among meteoritic material. However, it has been shown that 238U/235U ratios are variable among meteoritic material. To accommodate this, U-corrected Pb–Pb dating analysis is used to generate ages for the oldest solid material in the solar system using a revised 238U/235U value of 137.786 ± 0.013 to represent the mean 238U/235U isotope ratio bulk inner solar system materials. The result of U-corrected Pb–Pb dating has produced ages of 4567.35 ± 0.28 My for CAIs (A) and chondrules with ages between 4567.32 ± 0.42 and 4564.71 ± 0.30 My (B and C) (see figure). This supports the idea that CAIs crystallization and chondrule formation occurred around the same time during the formation of the solar system. However, chondrules continued to form for approximately 3 My after CAIs. Hence the best age for the original formation of the solar system is 4567.7 My. This date also represents the time of initiation of planetary accretion. Successive collisions between accreted bodies led to the formation of larger and larger planetesimals, finally forming the Earth–Moon system in a giant impact event. The age difference between CAIs and chondrules measured in these studies verifies the chronology of the early solar system derived from extinct short-lived nuclide methods such as 26Al-26Mg, thus improving our understanding of the development of the solar system and the formation of the earth.

Czechoslovak Army took part in the brief Polish-Czechoslovak War in which Czechoslovakia annexed the Zaolzie region from Poland. In the interbellum the force was fairly modern by contemporary standards, with the core of the force formed by LT vz. 38 and LT vz. 35 tanks, as well as an extensive system of border fortifications. Mobilised during the Munich Conference, the force did not take part in any organised defence of the country against invading Germans due to international isolation of Czechoslovakia. The army was disbanded following the German takeover of Czechoslovakia in 1939. During World War II the Czechoslovak Army was recreated in exile, first in the form of the new Czechoslovak Legion fighting alongside of Poland during the Invasion of Poland and then in the form of forces loyal to the London-based Czechoslovak government-in-exile. After the war Czechoslovak units fighting alongside the Allies returned to Czechoslovakia and formed the core of the new, recreated Czechoslovak Army. However, with the Communist takeover of Czechoslovakia, it was being increasingly Sovietised and in 1954 was formally renamed to Czechoslovak People's Army. The army of Czechoslovakia returned to the former name in 1990, following the Velvet Revolution, but in 1993, following the Dissolution of Czechoslovakia, it was disbanded and split into modern Army of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Armed Forces.

This method makes use of the ability of magnetic fields to polarize the light emitted (or absorbed) in spectral lines formed in the stellar atmosphere (the Zeeman effect). The periodic modulation of Zeeman signatures during the stellar rotation is employed to make an iterative reconstruction of the vectorial magnetic field at stellar surface. The method was first proposed by Marsh and Horne in 1988, as a way to interpret the emission line variations of cataclysmic variable stars. This techniques is based on the principle of maximum entropy image reconstruction; it yields the simplest magnetic field geometry (as a spherical harmonics expansion) among the various solutions compatible with the data. This technique is the first to enable the reconstruction of the vectorial magnetic geometry of stars similar to the Sun. It is now offering the opportunity to undertake systematic studies of stellar magnetism and is also yielding information on the geometry of large arches that magnetic fields are able to develop above stellar surfaces. To collect the observations related to Zeeman-Doppler Imaging, astronomers use stellar spectropolarimeters like ESPaDOnS ESPaDOnS at CFHT on Mauna Kea (Hawaii), HARPSpol http://www.astro.uu.se/~piskunov/RESEARCH/INSTRUMENTS/HARPSpol/ at the ESO's 3.6m telescope (La Silla Observatory, Chile), as well as NARVALNARVAL at Bernard Lyot Telescope (Pic du Midi de Bigorre, France). The technique is very reliable, as the reconstruction of the magnetic field maps with different algorithms yield almost identical results, even with poorly sampled data sets. It has however been shown, from both numerical simulations and observations, that the magnetic field strength and complexity is underestimated if no linear polarization spectra is available from observations. Since linear polarization signatures are weaker compared circular polarization their detections are not as reliable, particularly for cool stars. With more modern spectropolarimeters such as the recently installed SPIRou at CFHT and CRIRES+, currently in the process of installation, at the Very Large Telescope (Chile) the sensitivity to linear polarization will increase, allowing for more detailed studies of cool stars in the future.

First studied and purified within plants, phosphoglycolate phosphatase plays a major role in photorespiratory 2-phosphoglycolate metabolism, an essential pathway for photosynthesis in plants. The occurrence of photorespiration in plants, due to the lack of substrate specificity of rubisco, leads to the formation of 2-phosphoglycolate and 3-phosphogylcerate(PGA). PGA is the normal product of carboxylation and will enter the Calvin cycle. Phosphoglycolate, which is a potent inhibitor of phosphofructokinase and triosephosphate isomerase, must be quickly metabolized and transformed into a useful substrate, and phosphoglycolate phosphatase catalyzes the first step in the regeneration of 3-phosphoglycerate from 2-phosphoglycolate at the expense of energy in the form of ATP. Since the discovery of its activity in plants, it has been purified within human cells and implicated in 2,3-DPG regulation.  Structure  The structural characterization of phosphoglycolate phosphatase from Thermoplasma acidophilum (PDB 1L6R, pictured) revealed the monomer of the dimeric enzyme (indicated by the light blue and green coloring) includes two distinct domains, a smaller cap domain and a larger core domain. While the topology of the large domain is conserved, there is structural variation of the smaller domain. The active site of the protein is a continuous tunnel through the monomer and is lined with acidic residues, a feature consistent with other acid phosphatases. In addition, electrostatic surface analysis indicates a relatively acidic surface.  Active site and  The crystallization of phosphoglycolate phosphatase from Thermoplasma acidophilum revealed 5 active sites indicated by the blue spheres in the image. The key residues of the active site are aspartate, lysine, and serine.  Mechanism  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. 512x512px The hydrolysis of phosphoglycolate begins with the nucleophilic attack by an aspartate residue on the electrophilic phosphorus of the phosphoglycolate. The susceptibility of the bond between phosphate and glycolate is heightened by two key interactions. An interaction with the cofactor, Mg2+, helps polarize the phosphate-oxygen bond and therefore increases the electrophilicity of the phosphorus atom. The other interaction of the phosphate with serine and lysine residues further increases the electrophilicity of the phosphorus atom. In addition, the Mg2+ also orients the nucleophilic aspartate. The loss of the phosphate glycolate bond causes the nucleophilic aspartate to be phosphorylated, producing the enzyme intermediate, while glycolate is released from the active site. The interaction of the phosphorylated intermediate is stabilized by an interaction between the phosphate and a lysine residue. The Mg2+ located in the active site activates a water molecule to produce an hydroxide ion, which then hydrolyzes the phosphorylated aspartate and regenerates an active enzyme while releasing phosphate.  Function   Plants  It was previously believed that the evolution of the photorespiratory glycolate mechanism that involves phosphoglycolate phosphatase was essential for photosynthesis in more complex plants and unnecessary for cyanobacteria because of their ability to concentrate CO2 and therefore, avoid photorespiration, similar to C4 plants. However, the finding of three different phosphoglycolate metabolism pathways within the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 implicates that cyanobacteria were not only the evolutionary origin of oxygenic photosynthesis but also ancient photorespiratory phosphoglycolate metabolism, which might have been conveyed endosymbiotically to plants. Drawing on earlier research that indicated the presence of phosphoglycolic acid in algae through labeling of C14O2 and P28-orthophosphate, Richardson & Tolbert were the first to find a phosphatase activity specific for phosphoglycolate in tobacco leaves. The pH optimum of the enzyme is 6.3, and Mg2+ or Mn2+ ions as cofactors were necessary for activity. Mg2+ has been consistently noted to yield the maximum turnover rate. In other studies, Co2+ could also act as a divalent cofactor. In addition, Ca2+, despite being divalent, inhibits phosphoglycolate phosphatase on levels of greater than 90% of its enzymatic activity by acting as a competitive inhibitor to Mg2+. Finally, Cl− can activate at low concentrations (up to 50mM), but at high concentrations, chloride ions will act as competitive inhibitors with respect to phosphoglycolate. The enzyme localizes to the chloroplast, and plant studies, involving C14O2 fixation in the light, identified labeled glycolate outside of the chloroplast, suggesting that the activity of phosphoglycolate phosphatase allows the movement of glycolate out of the chloroplast. When a photorespiratory mutant of the eukaryotic green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was studied, the mutant strain was identified with a conditional lethal growth phenotype that required elevated concentrations of CO2 for growth. The observation of large phosphoglycolate accumulation and the absence of glycolate accumulation ruled out the possible cause of the absence or mutation of the CO2-concentrating mechanism and indicated that phosphoglycolate phosphatase was most likely absent or deficient. The study concluded that the mutant phenotype arose from a phosphoglycolate phosphatase deficiency caused by a single-gene, nuclear mutation, which they subsequently named pgp1. The deficiency inhibited the photorespiratory metabolic pathway, and the subsequent buildup of phosphoglycolate inhibited the Calvin Cycle. Since this initial study, three putative PGP genes have been identified, PGP1, PGP2, and PGP3. Ensuing studies 20 years after the identification of the same mutant strain of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii found that the conditional lethal phenotype was no longer present despite the continued presence of the splice mutation of pgp1. Explanation of this occurrence concluded that the PGP2 gene was upregulated and most likely contributed to the phenotypic reversion in the pgp1 mutant. Arabidopsis thaliana is the only plant with a known set of well- defined photorespiratory mutants. One of the is a knockout mutant that is devoid of 2PG phosphatase (PGLP). A high level of CO2 (1%), for example, is required for normal growth of those mutants. In normal low CO2 conditions, growth is strongly impaired.  Mammalian  Partial purification analysis has shown that human erythrocytes contain phosphoglycolate phosphatase as a cytoplasmic dimeric enzyme with molecular weight of 72,000. Approximately 5% of the enzyme’s total activity is membrane-associated. It shows optimum pH of 6.7 and has a Michaelis constant of 1 mM for phosphoglycolate. The activity of the enzyme is Mg2+-dependent. Co2+, and to a smaller extent Mn2+, may substitute for Mg2+. However, it has shown that though the enzyme requires both free Mg2+ and phosphoglycolate, the Mg2+-phosphoglycolate complex has inhibitory effects on enzymatic activity. In 1977, Badwey first demonstrated phosphoglycolate phosphatase activity in human erythrocytes and speculated that the enzyme’s activity may function to protect red cells from inadvertently formed phosphoglycolate, which is synthesized by pyruvate kinase. The implication of phosphoglycolate phosphatase’s role in human red blood cells was discovered when its substrate, phosphoglycolate, was shown to be a potent activator of the enzyme 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate phosphatase(2,3-DPG), another hydrolase which catalyzes the metabolic reaction of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate to 3-phosphoglycerate. In the presence of 0.02 mM phosphoglycolate, the phosphatase activity of 2,3-DPG is activated more than 1000-fold. The implication of phosphoglycolate phosphatase in the regulation of 2,3-PGA suggests the importance of having a functional version of the enzyme. In all animal tissues, 2,3-PGA is important as the cofactor of the glycolytic enzyme, phosphoglycerate mutase. More important, the synthesis and breakdown of 2,3-PGA is critical to regulation of hemoglobin’s binding affinity to oxygen, and an increase in its concentration leads to increased tissue oxygenation while a decrease may lead to tissue hypoxia. Therefore, the activation of the enzyme responsible for the metabolic breakdown of 2,3-PGA by phosphoglycolate could implicate phosphoglycolate phosphatase in the regulation of 2,3-PGA concentrations. = Human = Phosphoglycolate phosphatase exhibits electrophoretically distinctive variant forms. Found in all human tissues, including red cells, lymphocytes, and cultured fibroblasts, the highest enzymatic activity was noted within skeletal and cardiac muscle. Research into the genetic polymorphism indicates that PGP is likely determined by three alleles at a single autosomal locus, which is expressed in all human tissues. Preliminary observations of fetal tissue suggest that the PGP locus is also fully expressed during intra-uterine life. Initial research has also shown appreciable genetic variation indicated by the detection of 6 phenotypes within a small European population.

Women have historically had lower participation levels in medical fields compared to men with occupancy rates varying by race, socioeconomic status, and geography. Women's informal practice of medicine in roles such as caregivers, or as allied health professionals, has been widespread. Since the start of the 20th century, most countries of the world provide women with equal access to medical education. Not all countries ensure equal employment opportunities, and gender equality has yet to be achieved within medical specialties and around the world, studies suggesting that female doctors may be providing higher-quality care than male doctors. History Ancient medicine The involvement of women in the field of medicine has been recorded in several early civilizations. An Egyptian of the Early Dynastic Period or Old Kingdom of Egypt, Merit-Ptah, described in an inscription as \\"chief physician\\", is the earliest woman named in the history of science. Agamede was cited by Homer as a healer in ancient Greece before the Trojan War. Agnodice was the first female physician to practice legally in 4th century BC Athens. Metrodora was a physician and generally regarded as the first medical writer. Her book, On the Diseases and Cures of Women, was the oldest medical book written by a female and was often referenced by many other female physicians. She credited much of her writings to the ideologies of Hippocrates. Medieval Europe Hildegard of Bingen, a Medieval German abbess who wrote Causae et Curae, 1175. During the Middle Ages, convents were a centralized place of education for women, and some of these communities provided opportunities for women to contribute to scholarly research. An example is the German abbess Hildegard of Bingen, whose prolific writings include treatments of various scientific subjects, including medicine, botany and natural history (c.1151–58). She is considered Germany's first female physician. Women in the Middle Ages participated in healing techniques and capacities. Women occupied select ranks of medical personnel during the period. They worked as herbalists, midwives, surgeons, barber- surgeons, nurses, and traditional empirics. Women healers treated most patients, not limiting themselves to treating solely women. The names of 24 women described as surgeons in Naples, Italy between 1273 and 1410 have been recorded, and references have been found to 15 women practitioners, most of them Jewish and none described as midwives, in Frankfurt, Germany between 1387 and 1497. Women also engaged in midwifery and healing arts without having their activities recorded in written records, and practiced in rural areas or where there was little access to medical care. Society in the Middle Ages limited women's role as physician. Once universities established faculties of medicine during the thirteenth century, women were excluded from advanced medical education. Licensure began to require clerical vows for which women were ineligible, and healing as a profession became male-dominated. In many occasions, women had to fight against accusation of illegal practice done by males, putting into question their motives. If they were not accused of malpractice, then women were considered \\"witches\\" by both clerical and civil authorities. Surgeons and barber-surgeons were often organized into guilds, they could hold out longer against the pressures of licensure. Like other guilds, a number of the barber-surgeon guilds allowed the daughters and wives of their members to take up membership in the guild, generally after the man's death. Katherine la surgiene of London, daughter of Thomas the surgeon and sister of William the Surgeon belonged to a guild in 1286. Documentation of female members in the guilds of Lincoln, Norwich, Dublin and York continue until late in the period. Midwives, those who assisted pregnant women through childbirth and some aftercare, included only women. Midwives constituted roughly one third of female medical practitioners. Men did not involve themselves in women's medical care; women did not involve themselves in men's health care. The southern Italian coastal town of Salerno was a center of medical education and practice in the 12th century. In Salerno the physician Trota of Salerno compiled a number of her medical practices in several written collections. One work on women's medicine that was associated with her, the De curis mulierum (\\"On Treatments for Women\\") formed the core of what came to be known as the Trotula ensemble, a compendium of three texts that circulated throughout medieval Europe. Trota herself gained a reputation that spread as far as France and England. There are also references in the writings of other Salernitan physicians to the mulieres Salernitane (\\"Salernitan women\\"), which give some idea of local empirical practices.Monica H. Green, ed. and trans., The 'Trotula': A Medieval Compendium of Women's Medicine (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001). Dorotea Bucca, an Italian physician, was chair of philosophy and medicine at the University of Bologna for over forty years from 1390.Brooklyn Museum: Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art: The Dinner Party: Heritage Floor: Dorotea Bucca (accessed 22 August 2007) Other Italian women whose contributions in medicine have been recorded include Abella, Jacqueline Felice de Almania, Alessandra Giliani, Rebecca de Guarna, Margarita, Mercuriade (14th century), Constance Calenda, Clarice di Durisio (15th century), Constanza, Maria Incarnata and Thomasia de Mattio.Howard S. The Hidden Giants, p. 35, (Lulu.com; 2006) (accessed 22 August 2007) Medieval Islamic world For the medieval Islamic world, little information is known about female medical practitioners although it is likely that women were regularly involved in medical practice in some capacity. Male medical writers refer to the presence of female practitioners (a ṭabība) in describing certain procedures or situations. The late-10th to early-11th century Andalusi physician and surgeon al-Zahrawi wrote that certain medical procedures were difficult for male doctors practicing on female patients because of the need to touch the genitalia. The male practitioner was required to either find a female doctor who could perform the procedure, or a eunuch physician, or a midwife who took instruction from the male surgeon. The existence of female practitioners can be inferred, albeit not explicitly, through direct evidence.Monica H. Green, \\"History of Science,\\" Encyclopedia of Women and Islamic Cultures. Volume I: Methodologies, Paradigms and Sources, Suad Joseph, general editor (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 2003), pp. 358–61; Peter Pormann, \\"Female Patients and Practitioners in Medieval Islam,\\" The Lancet 373 (9 May 2009), pp. 1598–99. Midwives played a prominent role in the delivery of women's healthcare. For these practitioners, there is more detailed information, both in terms of the prestige of their craft (ibn Khaldun calls it a noble craft, \\"something necessary in civilization\\") and in terms of biographical information on historic women.Jean-Pierre Molénat, \\"Priviligiées ou poursuivies: quatre sages-femmes musulmanes dans la Castille du XVe siècle,\\" Identidades marginales, ed. Cristina de la Puente, Estudios onomástico-biográficos de al-Andalus, 13 (Madrid: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, 2003), 413–30. To date, no known medical treatise written by a woman in the medieval Islamic world has been identified. Western medicine in China Traditional Chinese medicine based on the use of herbal medicine, acupuncture, massage and other forms of therapy has been practiced in China for thousands of years. Western medicine was introduced to China in the 19th Century, mainly by medical missionaries sent from various Christian mission organizations, such as the London Missionary Society (Britain), the Methodist Church (Britain) and the Presbyterian Church (US). Benjamin Hobson (1816–1873), a medical missionary sent by the London Missionary Society in 1839, set up the Wai Ai Clinic (惠愛醫館) in Guangzhou, China. The Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese (香港華人西醫書院) was founded in 1887 by the London Missionary Society, with its first graduate (in 1892) being Sun Yat-sen (孫中山). Due to the social custom that men and women should not be near to one another, Chinese women were reluctant to be treated by Western male doctors. This resulted in a need for female doctors. One of these was Sigourney Trask of the Methodist Episcopal Church, who set-up a hospital in Fuzhou during the mid-19th century. Trask also arranged for a local girl, Hü King Eng, to study medicine at Ohio Wesleyan Female College, with the intention that Hü would return to practise western medicine in Fuzhou. After graduation, Hü became the resident physician at Fuzhou's Woolston Memorial Hospital in 1899 and trained several female physicians. Another female medical missionary Mary H. Fulton (1854–1927) was sent by the Foreign Missions Board of the Presbyterian Church (US) to found the first medical college for women in China. Known as the Hackett Medical College for Women (夏葛女子醫學院), this college was located in Guangzhou, China, and was enabled by a large donation from Edward A. K. Hackett (1851–1916) of Indiana. The college was dedicated in 1902 and offered a four-year curriculum. By 1915, there were more than 60 students, mostly in residence. Most students became Christians, due to the influence of Fulton. The college was aimed at the spreading of Christianity and modern medicine and the elevation of Chinese women's social status. The graduates of this College included Chau Lee-sun (周理信, 1890–1979) and Wong Yuen-hing (黃婉卿), both of whom graduated in the late 1910s and then practiced medicine in the hospitals in Guangdong province. Midwifery in 18th century America Out of the different occupations women took on around this time, midwifery was one of the highest-paying industries. In the 18th century, households tended to have an abundance of children largely in part to having hired help and diminished mortality rates. Despite the high chance of complications in labor, American midwife Martha Ballard, specifically, had high success rates in delivering healthy babies to healthy mothers. Women's health movement, 1970s The 1970s marked an increase of women entering and graduating from medical school in the United States. From 1930 to 1970, a period of 40 years, around 14,000 women graduated from medical school. From 1970 to 1980, a period of 10 years, over 20,000 women graduated from medical school.Paludi, Michele A. and Gertrude A. Streuernage, ed., Foundations for a Feminist Restructuring of the Academic Disciplines (New York: Harrington Park Press, 1990), p. 236. This increase of women in the medical field was due to both political and cultural changes. Two laws in the U.S. lifted restrictions for women in the medical field – Title IX of the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1972 and the Public Health Service Act of 1975, banning discrimination on grounds of gender. In November 1970, the Assembly of the Association of American Medical Colleges rallied for equal rights in the medical field.Paludi and Streuernage, Foundations for a Feminist Restructuring of the Academic Disciplines, pf. 236. Throughout the decade women's ideas about themselves and their relation to the medical field were shifting due to the women's feminist movement. A sharp increase of women in the medical field led to developments in doctor-patient relationships, changes in terminology and theory. One area of medical practice that was challenged and changed was gynecology.Kline, Wendy. Bodies of Knowledge: Sexuality, Reproduction, and Women's Health in the Second Wave (University of Chicago Press, 2010). Author Wendy Kline noted that \\"to ensure that young brides were ready for the wedding night, [doctors] used the pelvic exam as a form of sex instruction.\\"Kline, Bodies of Knowledge: Sexuality, Reproduction, and Women's Health in the Second Wave, p 4. With higher numbers of women enrolled in medical school, medical practices like gynecology were challenged and subsequently altered. In 1972, the University of Iowa Medical School instituted a new training program for pelvic and breast examinations. Students would act both as the doctor and the patient, allowing each student to understand the procedure and create a more gentle, respectful examination. With changes in ideologies and practices throughout the 70s, by 1980 over 75 schools had adopted this new method.Paludi and Streuernage, Foundations for a Feminist Restructuring of the Academic Disciplines, p. 241. Along with women entering the medical field and feminist rights movement came also the women's health movement which sought alternative methods of health care for women. This came through the creation of self-help books, most notably Our Bodies, Ourselves: A Book by and for Women.Boston Women's Health Book Collective Staff, Our Bodies, Ourselves: A Book by and for Women (Boston: Simon and Schuster Trade, 1976). This book gave women a \\"manual\\" to help understand their body. It challenged hospital treatment, and doctors' practices. Aside from self-help books, many help centres were opened: birth centres run by midwives, safe abortion centres, and classes for educating women on their bodies, all with the aim of providing non-judgmental care for women.Schulman, Bruce J. The Seventies: The Great Shift in American Culture, Society, and politics. (Da Capo Press, 2002), p. 174. The women's health movement, along with women involved in the medical field, opened the doors for research and awareness for female illness like breast cancer and cervical cancer. Scholars in the history of medicine had developed some study of women in the field—biographies of pioneering women physicians were common prior to the 1960s—and study of women in medicine took particular root with the advent of the women's movement in the 1960s, and in conjunction with the women's health movement.

Awa Marie Coll-Seck, Senegal's former Minister of Health, in 2009. In 1540, Henry VIII of England granted the charter for the Company of Barber-Surgeons; while this led to the specialization of healthcare professions (i.e. surgeons and barbers), women were barred from professional practice.The History of Women in Surgery, by Debrah A. Wirtzfeld, MD Women did continue to practice during this time without formal training or recognition in England and eventually North America for the next several centuries. Women's participation in the medical professions was generally limited by legal and social practices during the decades while medicine was professionalizing.See generally Barbara Ehrenreich & Deirdre English, Witches, Midwives, and Nurses (1973). Women openly practiced medicine in the allied health professions (nursing, midwifery, etc.), and throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, women made significant gains in access to medical education and medical work through much of the world. These gains were sometimes tempered by setbacks; for instance, Mary Roth Walsh documented a decline in women physicians in the US in the first half of the twentieth century, such that there were fewer women physicians in 1950 than there were in 1900.Walsh, 1977. Through the latter half of the twentieth century, women made gains generally across the board. In the United States, for instance, women were 9% of total US medical school enrollment in 1969; this had increased to 20% in 1976. By 1985, women constituted 16% of practicing American physicians.Morantz-Sanchez, Preface. At the beginning of the 21st-century in industrialized nations, women have made significant gains, but have yet to achieve parity throughout the medical profession. Women have achieved parity in medical school in some industrialized countries, since 2003 forming the majority of the United States medical school applicants. In 2007–2008, women accounted for 49% of medical school applicants and 48.3% of those accepted. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) 48.4% (8,396) of medical degrees awarded in the US in 2010–2011 were earned by women, an increase from 26.8% in 1982–1983. While more women are taking part in the medical field, a 2013–2014 study reported that there are significantly fewer women in leadership positions within the academic realm of medicine. This study found that women accounted for 16% of deans, 21% of the professors, and 38% of faculty, as compared to their male counterparts. The practice of medicine remains disproportionately male overall. In industrialized nations, the recent parity in gender of medical students has not yet trickled into parity in practice. In many developing nations, neither medical school nor practice approach gender parity. Moreover, there are skews within the medical profession: some medical specialties, such as surgery, are significantly male-dominated,Dixie Mills, \\"Women in Surgery – Past, Present, and Future\\" (2003 presentation), Association of Women Surgeons; available at AWS website . while other specialties are significantly female-dominated, or are becoming so. In the United States, female physicians outnumber male physicians in pediatrics and female residents outnumber male residents in family medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, pathology, and psychiatry. Women continue to dominate in nursing. In 2000, 94.6% of registered nurses in the United States were women. In health care professions as a whole in the US, women numbered approximately 14.8 million, as of 2011. Biomedical research and academic medical professions—i.e., faculty at medical schools—are also disproportionately male. Research on this issue, called the \\"leaky pipeline\\" by the National Institutes of Health and other researchers, shows that while women have achieved parity with men in entering graduate school, a variety of discrimination causes them to drop out at each stage in the academic pipeline: graduate school, postdoc, faculty positions, achieving tenure; and, ultimately, in receiving recognition for groundbreaking work.The term was coined by S.E. Berryman in \\"Who Will Do Science?\\", 1983; see Louise Luckenbill-Edds, \\"2000 WICB/Career Strategy Columns (Archive)\\" , 1 November 2000, WICB Newsletter, American Society for Cell Biology.A. N.

Glass ceiling The \\"glass ceiling\\" is a metaphor to convey the undefined obstacles that women and minorities face in the workplace. Female physicians of the late 19th-century faced discrimination in many forms due to the prevailing Victorian Era attitude that the ideal woman be demure, display a gentle demeanor, act submissively, and enjoy a perceived form of power that should be exercised over and from within the home. Medical degrees were difficult for women to earn, and once practicing, discrimination from landlords for medical offices, left female physicians to set up their practices on \\"Scab Row\\" or \\"bachelor's apartments.\\" The Journal of Women's Health surveyed physician mothers and their physician daughters in order to analyze the effect that discrimination and harassment have on the individual and their career. This study included 84% of physician mothers that graduated medical school prior to 1970, with the majority of these physicians graduating in the 1950s and 1960s. The authors of this study stated that discrimination in the medical field persisted after the title VII discrimination legislation was passed in 1965. This was the case until 1970, when the National Organization for Women (NOW) filed a class action lawsuit against all medical schools in the United States. By 1975, the number of women in medicine had nearly tripled, and has continued to grow. By 2005, more than 25% of physicians and around 50% of medical school students were women. The increase of women in medicine also came with an increase of women identifying as a racial/ethnic minority, yet this population is still largely underrepresented in comparison to the general population of the medical field. Within this specific study, 22% of physician mothers and 24% of physician daughters identified themselves as being an ethnic minority. These women reported experiencing instances of exclusion from career opportunities as a result of their race and gender. According to this article, females tend to have lessened confidence in their abilities as a doctor, yet their performance is equivalent to that of their male counterparts. This study also commented on the impact of power dynamics within medical school, which is established as a hierarchy that ultimately shapes the educational experience. Instances of sexual harassment attribute to the high attrition rates of females in the STEM fields. Competition between midwifery and obstetrics A shift from women midwifery to male obstetrics occurs in the growth of medical practices such as the founding of the American Medical Association. Instead of assisting labor in the basis of an emergency, doctors took over the delivery of babies completely; putting midwifery second. This is an example of the growing sense of competition between male physicians and female midwives as a rise in obstetrics took hold. The education of women on the basis of midwifery was stunted by both physicians and public-health reformers, driving midwifery to be seen as out of practice. Societal roles also played a fact in the downfall of the practice in midwifery because women were unable to obtain the education needed for licensing and once married, women were to embrace a domestic lifestyle.

It is a worker placement game with a focus on resource management. In Agricola, players are farmers that sow, plow the fields, collect wood, build stables, buy animals, expand their farms and feed their families. After 14 rounds players calculate their score based on the size and prosperity of the household. The game was published by Lookout Games and released at Spiel 2007, where it was voted second-best game shown at the convention, according to the Fairplay in-show voting. The game was released in English by Z-Man Games in July 2008. Playdek released an iOS conversion of the game in June 2013. A second edition of Agricola was published by Mayfair Games in May 2016. Agricola won the Spiel des Jahres special award for \\"Best complex game 2008\\" and the 2008 Deutscher Spiele Preis. It was also the game which ended Puerto Rico's run of more than five years as the highest-rated game on the board game website BoardGameGeek, staying at the top of the rankings between September 2008 and March 2010. , Agricola is ranked 25th among all board games on BoardGameGeek. A two player version called Agricola: All Creatures Big & Small was released in 2012. There is also a corresponding iOS app.  Gameplay  A game of Agricola being set up. This is the original version with round resource counters. Players start the game with a farming couple living in a two roomed hut. Each round, they take turns to place their family members on action spaces to get resources and improve and grow their households. Only one family member can occupy each action space within the same round, so players need to time their actions to get maximum profit while denying progress to the opponents. The game is played in 14 rounds, divided by 6 harvests. At each harvest, food is grown, people are fed, and animals multiply. Players lose victory points if they have trouble feeding their family, which makes food production a major point of tension in the game. At the end of round 14 comes the final harvest after which victory points are counted. Scoring in Agricola rewards a middle of the road strategy. Players are penalized for not focusing on any one aspect of the game, and stop scoring in any area they focus on too much. The player with the most balanced and prosperous farm wins.  Optional cards  To achieve variation between games, players are dealt a hand of optional cards – occupations and minor improvements. Players get additional resources and various bonuses for playing these cards. They can also get an initial direction for their strategy, based on the occupations and improvements they were dealt. Numerous expansion decks have been released to fill in gaps in gameplay and add thematic settings. The game offers a simplified 'family' variation for less involved players, in which occupation and minor improvement cards are not used.  Differences in the Revised Edition  The original Agricola used multicolored wooden pieces of the same circular shape to denote various resources (clay, wood, reeds, etc.). The 2016 edition offered shaped wooden pieces for resources that make it easier to differentiate between the many types of resources. The new edition also included fewer optional cards – two decks for a total of 96 cards (as opposed to three decks with 308 cards in the original edition). Some reviewers praised the balance of the new decks.

This enzyme participates in indole and ipecac alkaloid biosynthesis.  Nomenclature  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is polyneuridine aldehyde hydrolase (decarboxylating). Other names in common use include: * polyneuridine aldehyde esterase * PNAE  Homologues  This enzyme is found in various forms in plant species such as Arabidopsis thaliana, Glycine max (soybean), Vitis vinifera (wine grape), and Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) among others. Polyneuridine-aldehyde esterase also appears in select bacteria including Enterobacter cloacae.  Structure  The secondary structure of this enzyme consists mainly of alpha helices. In its native form, this enzyme has a tertiary structure that includes two main lobes (as depicted above in the blue 3D representation on the top right).  Reaction  { frameless \\\\xrightarrow[+ H_2O\\\\ -CH_3OH]{polyneuridine-aldehyde\\\\ esterase} frameless \\\\xrightarrow[- CO_2]{} frameless } Polyneuridine-aldehyde esterase catalyzes the hydrolysis of the methyl ester in polyneuridine aldehyde to form polyneuridine β-aldehydoacid and methanol. The carboxylic acid in the product spontaneously undergoes decarboxylation, yielding 16-epivellosimine and carbon dioxide.  Mechanism  Crystallographic structure of polyneuridine aldehyde esterase from Rauvolfia serpentina (rainbow colored, N-terminus = blue, C-terminus = red). The enzyme is complexed with its product 16-epi-vellosimine that is depicted as a space- filling model (carbon = white, oxygen = red, nitrogen = blue).; The mechanism of hydrolysis performed by polyneuridine-aldehyde esterase is not known. It has been suggested that the enzyme utilizes a catalytic triad composed of Ser-87, Asp-216 and His-244. The catalytic amino acid order is the same as the order of enzymes that are part of the α/β hydrolase family. Thus polyneuridine-aldehyde esterase may be a novel member of the α/β hydrolase group. Broader significance This enzyme is a part of the pathway of indole alkaloid biosynthesis. The indole alkaloids that result from this metabolic pathway are used by many plant species as a defense against herbivores and parasites.  Open questions  The precise mechanisms by which this enzyme performs its function is still unknown. As noted above, researchers are formulating suggestions as to how polyneuridine-aldehyde esterase catalyses the decomposition of polyneuridine-aldehyde, but a mechanism has not yet been affirmed with absolute certainty. Due to the lack of complete understanding of polyneuridine-aldehyde esterase's precise mechanism, this enzyme cannot be grouped into a family of enzymes. Based on mechanism theories, suggestions can be made as to how this enzyme should be categorized, and some parallels can be drawn between polyneuridine-aldehyde esterase and other enzymes.

This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways: two-component system - general, bacterial chemotaxis - general, and bacterial chemotaxis - organism-specific. CheB is part of a two-component signal transduction system. These systems enable bacteria to sense, respond, and adapt to a wide range of environments, stressors, and growth conditions. Two-component systems are composed of a sensor histidine kinase (HK) and its cognate response regulator (RR). The HK catalyses its own autophosphorylation followed by the transfer of the phosphoryl group to the receiver domain on RR; phosphorylation of the RR usually activates an attached output domain, in this case a methyltransferase domain. CheB is involved in chemotaxis. CheB methylesterase is responsible for removing the methyl group from the gamma-glutamyl methyl ester residues in the methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCP). CheB is regulated through phosphorylation by CheA. The N-terminal region of the protein is similar to that of other regulatory components of sensory transduction systems.

She was later the American merchant ship Gussie Telfair until wrecked in 1880.  Blockade runner C.S.S. Gertrude  The iron-hulled steamer Gertrude was built in Whiteinch, Glasgow, Scotland as Yard No.100 at the Clydeholm yard of Barclay, Curle & Company as an American Civil War blockade runner and launched on 25 November 1862. Along with her sistership Emma, she was built for Thomas Stirling Begbie, a London shipowner and merchant. Gertrude was measured as 278grt and 191nrt, with dimensions 164.4 feet length overall, 21.2 feet beam and 12.2 feet depth. She was powered by 2-cylinder oscillating engine of 100nhp, made by John Scott's Greenock Foundry Company, Greenock. Gertrude made her first run of the blockade from Nassau, Bahamas to Charleston, South Carolina, arriving 16 March 1863, and returned safely with 820 bales of cotton. On her next trip, Gertrude had barely left Nassau when she was chased and captured on 16 April 1863 by the gunboat off Eleuthera Island, Bahamas.

Assigned to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron under Rear Admiral David Farragut, Gertrude arrived off Mobile, Alabama, in early August and on 16 August captured the Confederate blockade runner Warrior following a 9-hour chase. After taking her prize to New Orleans, Louisiana, Gertrude was assigned to blockade duty off that port. She served as a blockading ship, alternating between New Orleans and Mobile, until May 1864, and was credited with the capture of schooner Ellen on 16 January 1864. During this period she also spent short periods at Ship Island, Mississippi, and New Orleans for repairs.  Texas coast operations  Beginning in May 1864, Gertrude was assigned to blockade the Texas coast, and spent most of the next year off Galveston, Texas. She visited blockading stations off Sabine Pass and Velasco, Texas, and took blockade runner Eco off Galveston 19 February 1865. Gertrude also captured over 50 bales of cotton 19 April 1865 which were thrown overboard by famous Confederate blockade runner Denbigh during her escape from the blockading fleet.  Post-war decommissioning, sale, and subsequent career  Gertrude decommissioned 11 August 1865 at the Philadelphia Navy Yard and was sold 30 November at New York City to George Wright. She was redocumented Gussie Telfair in 1866 and sailed as a merchantman until 1878.

Onyonka (1939–1996) was a Kenyan politician. Onyonka was the foreign minister of his country from 1969 to 1996 under several other ministries up to and including Education, Economic Planning & Development and Trade and Foreign Affairs. Well Known within the Kisii community, he was always at loggerheads with then Nyaribari chache MP Simeon Nyachae until he died. Onyonka was elected to parliament in the 1969 elections from Kitutu West Constituency when he trounced the first cabinet minister from Kisii, Lawrence Sagini Ndemo. He was the youngest MP at about 25 years. He retained his parliamentary seat until his death. He was famous for leading an anti-Nyachae crusade in Kisii after he was released from Kodiaga prison in Kisumu. He had been arrested and charged with murder following a fatal shooting incident involving his bodyguards and a voter in then Kiututu West constituency campaigns. Ouru Ndege was shot dead after he attempted to attack Dr. Onyonka with a knife during the stormy 1983 campaigns along Kisii-Migori junction. His rival, John Bosco Mboga had just addressed his supporters in the area and when Onyonka, who was a cabinet minister in President Moi's government arrived, Ndege attempted to stab him with a sword leading to the minister's bodyguards shooting him to death. Onyonka and his guards did not have a car at the time of the shooting. He was rescued by a matatu driver, Joseph Moya Nyambariga, from Botoro area in Bomorenda, Bonchari, who drove the sieged minister in his matatu, christened Boringo Na Nagi Express to safety at Suneka Chief's camp. He was arrested soon after and locked up in Kisumu awaiting trial on murder charges. The prosecution was unable to prove the case against him and in 1984, Onyonka was set free. He had won the hotly contested election in absentia and after two years in the cold, Moi appointed him Minister for Foreign Affairs. Before the 1988 elections, Onyonka led a group of politicians from Kisii dubbed the Four Os. This stands for Onyonka, Obure (Chris from Bobasi) Omanga (Andrew from Nyaribari Chache) and Onyancha (David from West Mugirango) to launch the famous \\"Kebirigo Declaration\\" in which Nyachae was denounced. The Kebirigo declaration was a strong political ideology that stood for independence of each constituency in Kisii against manipulation from Nyachae. At that time, it had become increasingly evident that Nyachae who was a powerful civil servant was planning to plunge into active politics. Onyonka alleged that Nyachae had embarked on a series of secret campaigns, recruiting candidates against incumbent MPs so that he could make it to parliament with a clean slate of leaders, if he was cleared by KANU to run for elective seat. The Kebirigo declaration was therefore meant to assert the authority and legitimacy of each member of parliament from Kisii and also sought to reject the political dominion from Nyaribari, Nyachae's home constituency. After Onyonka's death in 1996, he was succeeded by Jimmy Nuru Angwenyi as MP for Kitutu Chache. His son Richard Momoima Onyonka, later dethroned Angwenyi to become the area MP. After the 2013 electoral review, Kitutu Chache was hived into two constituencies, North and South (Mosocho).

In 1960, Markov obtained fundamental results showing that the classification of four- dimensional manifolds is undecidable: no general algorithm exists for distinguishing two arbitrary manifolds with four or more dimensions. This is because four-dimensional manifolds have sufficient flexibility to allow us to embed any algorithm within their structure, so that classification of all four-manifolds would imply a solution to Turing's halting problem.

SBPase is an example of a phosphatase, or, more generally, a hydrolase. This enzyme participates in the Calvin cycle.  Structure  SBPase is a homodimeric protein, meaning that it is made up of two identical subunits. The size of this protein varies between species, but is about 92,000 Da (two 46,000 Da subunits) in cucumber plant leaves. The key functional domain controlling SBPase function involves a disulfide bond between two cysteine residues. These two cysteine residues, Cys52 and Cys57, appear to be located in a flexible loop between the two subunits of the homodimer, near the active site of the enzyme. Reduction of this regulatory disulfide bond by thioredoxin incites a conformational change in the active site, activating the enzyme. Additionally, SBPase requires the presence of magnesium (Mg2+) to be functionally active. SBPase is bound to the stroma-facing side of the thylakoid membrane in the chloroplast in a plant. Some studies have suggested the SBPase may be part of a large (900 kDa) multi-enzyme complex along with a number of other photosynthetic enzymes. Regulation Reaction catalyzed by sedoheptulose- bisphosphatase SBPase is involved in the regeneration of 5-carbon sugars during the Calvin cycle. Although SBPase has not been emphasized as an important control point in the Calvin cycle historically, it plays a large part in controlling the flux of carbon through the Calvin cycle. Additionally, SBPase activity has been found to have a strong correlation with the amount of photosynthetic carbon fixation. Like many Calvin cycle enzymes, SBPase is activated in the presence of light through a ferredoxin/thioredoxin system. In the light reactions of photosynthesis, light energy powers the transport of electrons to eventually reduce ferredoxin. The enzyme ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase uses reduced ferredoxin to reduce thioredoxin from the disulfide form to the dithiol. Finally, the reduced thioredoxin is used to reduced a cysteine-cysteine disulfide bond in SBPase to a dithiol, which converts the SBPase into its active form. This is an illustration of the regulation of SBPase by ferredoxin and thioredoxin. SBPase has additional levels of regulation beyond the ferredoxin/thioredoxin system. Mg2+ concentration has a significant impact on the activity of SBPase and the rate of the reactions it catalyzes. SBPase is inhibited by acidic conditions (low pH). This is a large contributor to the overall inhibition of carbon fixation when the pH is low inside the stroma of the chloroplast. Finally, SBPase is subject to negative feedback regulation by sedoheptulose-7-phosphate and inorganic phosphate, the products of the reaction it catalyzes. Evolutionary origin SBPase and FBPase (fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase) are both phosphatases that catalyze similar during the Calvin cycle. The genes for SBPase and FBPase are related. Both genes are found in the nucleus in plants, and have bacterial ancestry. SBPase is found across many species. In addition to being universally present in photosynthetic organism, SBPase is found in a number of evolutionarily- related, non-photosynthetic microorganisms. SBPase likely originated in red algae.  Horticultural Relevance  Carbonylation of a cysteine residue via hydroxyl radical, analogous to how SBPase is inactivated by ROS. Moreso than other enzymes in the Calvin cycle, SBPase levels have a significant impact on plant growth, photosynthetic ability, and response to environmental stresses. Small decreases in SBPase activity result in decreased photosynthetic carbon fixation and reduced plant biomass. Specifically, decreased SBPase levels result in stunted plant organ growth and development compared to wild-type plants, and starch levels decrease linearly with decreases in SBPase activity, suggesting that SBPase activity is a limiting factor to carbon assimilation. This sensitivity of plants to decreased SBPase activity is significant, as SBPase itself is sensitive to oxidative damage and inactivation from environmental stresses. SBPase contains several catalytically relevant cysteine residues that are vulnerable to irreversible oxidative carbonylation by reactive oxygen species (ROS), particularly from hydroxyl radicals created during the production of hydrogen peroxide. Carbonylation results in SBPase enzyme inactivation and subsequent growth retardation due to inhibition of carbon assimilation. Oxidative carbonylation of SBPase can be induced by environmental pressures such as chilling, which causes an imbalance in metabolic processes leading to increased production of reactive oxygen species, particularly hydrogen peroxide. Notably, chilling inhibits SBPase and a related enzyme, fructose bisphosphatase, but does not affect other reductively activated Calvin cycle enzymes. The sensitivity of plants to synthetically reduced or inhibited SBPase levels provides an opportunity for crop engineering. There are significant indications that transgenic plants which overexpress SBPase may be useful in improving food production efficiency by producing crops that are more resilient to environmental stresses, as well as have earlier maturation and higher yield. Overexpression of SBPase in transgenic tomato plants provided resistance to chilling stress, with the transgenic plants maintaining higher SBPase activity, increased carbon dioxide fixation, reduced electrolyte leakage and increased carbohydrate accumulation relative to wild-type plants under the same chilling stress. It is also likely that transgenic plants would be more resilient to osmotic stress caused by drought or salinity, as the activation of SBPase is shown to be inhibited in chloroplasts exposed to hypertonic conditions, though this has not been directly tested. Overexpression of SBPase in transgenic tobacco plants resulted in enhanced photosynthetic efficiency and growth. Specifically, transgenic plants exhibited greater biomass and improved carbon dioxide fixation, as well as an increase in RuBisCO activity. The plants grew significantly faster and larger than wild-type plants, with increased sucrose and starch levels.

Osteoid osteomas tend to be less than 1.5 cm in size. The tumor can be in any bone in the body but are most common in long bones, such as the femur and tibia. They account for 10 to 12 percent of all benign bone tumors. \\"Osteoid osteomas may occur at any age, and are most common in patients between the ages of 4 and 25 years old. Males are affected approximately three times more commonly than females.\\" Signs and symptoms The most common symptoms of an Osteoid Osteoma are: * dull pain that escalates to severe at night OR slight pain, rising to become severe even at nighttime, affecting sleep quality * limping * muscle atrophy * bowing deformity * swelling * increased or decreased bone growth The most common symptom is pain that can be relieved with over the counter pain medication in the beginning. After the benign tumor develops further the pain can not be alleviated with medication and minor to severe swelling starts to occur. Although, in some cases the pain level remains the same for years, and regular NSAIDs intake keeps the pain at bay. The tumor is often found through x-ray imaging. \\"Conventional radiographs reveal a well-demarcated lytic lesion (nidus) surrounded by a distinct zone of sclerosis\\" that allow doctors to identify the tumor. Characterized by being less than 1.5 cm in diameter, osteoid osteomas most frequently occur in young men (Male:Female ratio 3:1) and may occur in any bone of the body, most frequently around the knee but often also seen in the vertebrae, in the long bones and less commonly in the mandible or other craniofacial bones. Severe pain typically occurs at night, but can also be constant at any time of day. The chief complaint may only be of dull pain which is non radiating and persistent throughout 24 hours but increases significantly at night. Pain tends to be relieved with NSAIDs such as ibuprofen. Histological findings Micrograph of an osteoid osteoma showing the characteristic anastomosing bony trabeculae and osteoblastic rimming. H&E; stain. On histological examination, osteoid osteoma consists of a small (< 1.52 cm), yellowish-to-red nidus of osteoid and woven bone with interconnected trabeculae, and a background and rim of highly vascularized, fibrous connective tissue. Varying degrees of sclerotic bone reaction may surround the lesion. Benign osteoblastoma is virtually indistinguishable from osteoid osteoma. The usual appearance included a fibrovascular stroma with numerous osteoblasts, osteoid tissue, well-formed woven bone, and giant cells. The osteoblasts were generally small and regular in shape. Diagnosis CT scan showing an osteoid osteoma of the fibula with a clearly visible nidus Radiographs in osteoid osteoma typically show a round lucency, containing a dense sclerotic central nidus (the characteristic lesion in this kind of tumor) surrounded by sclerotic bone. The nidus is seldom larger than 1.5 cm. The lesion can in most cases be detected on CT scan, bone scans and angiograms. Plain radiographs are not always diagnostic. MRI adds little to the CT findings which are useful for localisation. Radionuclide scanning shows intense uptake which is useful for localisation at surgery using a hand held detector, and for confirmation that the entire lesion has been removed. Treatment Pain may be relieved by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Treatment varies based on the health of the patient. If he/she is otherwise healthy and is not significantly bothered by the pain, the tumor is treated symptomatically with anti-inflammatories. If this therapy fails or the location of the tumor could lead to growth disturbances, scoliosis, or osteoarthritis, surgical or percutaneous ablation may be considered.http://www.bonetumor.org/tumors-bone/osteoid-osteoma If surgery is preferred, the individual may be referred to a podiatrist or an orthopedic surgeon to perform the procedure. Post-surgery therapy and strengthening may be needed, depending on the tumor location and health of the individual. While shown to be effective, surgical resection has many potential complications, including difficult intraoperative identification of the tumor, local recurrence from incomplete resection, and resection of weight bearing bone that can necessitate prolonged hospital stays and complicate recovery. Recently, CT guided radiofrequency ablation has emerged as a less invasive alternative to surgical resection. In this technique, which can be performed under conscious sedation, an RF probe is introduced into the tumor nidus through a cannulated needle under CT guidance and heat is applied locally to destroy tumor cells. Since the procedure was first introduced for the treatment of osteoid osteomas in the early 1990s, it has been shown in numerous studies to be less invasive and expensive, to result in less bone destruction and to have equivalent safety and efficacy to surgical techniques, with 66 to 96% of patients reporting freedom from symptoms. While initial success rates with RFA are high, symptom recurrence after RFA treatment has been reported, with some studies demonstrating a recurrence rate similar to that of surgical treatment. As of July 17, 2014, treatment with incisionless surgery utilizing an MRI to guide high-intensity ultrasound waves to destroy a benign bone tumor in the leg has been demonstrated.Focused Ultrasound Foundation. \\"Bone tumor destroyed using incisionless surgery: First in North American child.\\" ScienceDaily.

These are groups located in a larger environment. The taken-for-granted practices of people in these groups are similar to patterns of behavior in the larger environment. When routinely performed, their actions acquire symbolic significance. They become part of a cognitive script that dictates behavior. The members of embedded groups do not just copy the practices. They express them in ways that may confirm patterns of behavior in the larger environment. In other words, the larger environment feeds the embedded group. Ritualized symbolic practices With the theory, ritualized symbolic practices (RSPs) are socially standardized actions that are schema-driven. The term schema refers to a cognitive structure or framework. According to the theory, ritual actions shape an actor's thoughts. This helps structural reproduction take place in specific domains of interaction. A domain of interaction is a bounded social arena which contains two or more actors engaged in face-to-face interaction Structural reproduction Four factors play an essential role in structural reproduction involving RSPs. They include repetitiveness, salience, homologousness, and resources. Repetitiveness entails the frequency with which an RSP is performed. Salience involves the degree to which an RSP is perceived to be central to an act, action sequence, or bundle of interrelated acts. Homologousness implies a similarity among different RSPs. Resources are materials needed to engage in RSPs which are available to actors. The greater the availability of resources, the more likely an actor will engage in an RSP. Rank With the theory, rank is important. Rank involves the standing of an RSP in terms of its dominance. A RSP has a high rank, and is likely to be repeated, if repetitiveness, salience, homologousness, and resources are all present. Empirical investigations have been carried out providing tests of the theory. They focus on: 1\\\\. Deritualization 2\\\\. Ritualized Practices in Organizations and Communities 3\\\\.

The game determined the 2007 football champion of the Southeastern Conference. The LSU Tigers, winners of the Western division of the SEC, defeated the Tennessee Volunteers, who won the Eastern division, by a score of 21–14. This was the second time the two teams have met in the conference championship game. The first time was in 2001 when LSU defeated Tennessee, 31–20. The loss knocked the Volunteers, ranked #2 at the time, out of the BCS National Championship Game which was played at the 2002 Rose Bowl. Selection process The SEC Championship Game matches up the winner of the Eastern and Western divisions of the Southeastern Conference. The game was first played in 1992, when the conference expanded from 10 to 12 teams with the addition of Arkansas and South Carolina. The SEC was the first conference in college football to have a conference championship game. Regular season LSU was ranked as high as #1 in the country and was a favorite to play in the national title game, however those dreams were thought to have been shattered when the Tigers lost to unranked Arkansas in 3 overtime periods at home on the final game of the regular season. LSU finished the regular season with a 10–2 record. They were 6–2 in the SEC and won the SEC Western Division outright. Tennessee began the season with a highly anticipated out-of-conference matchup with California in Berkeley. The 15th ranked Vols lost to the 12th ranked Golden Bears, 45–31. Tennessee slipped in the polls, eventually losing twice more to Florida and Alabama, however, they finished the season strong, winning their last five games. In the final game of the regular season, the Volunteers needed to beat Kentucky in order to secure a berth in the SEC Championship Game. If Kentucky won, then Georgia would be the representative from the Eastern division. The game was an exciting one as it went into 4 overtime periods. The Volunteers eventually won it by sacking Kentucky QB Andre Woodson during a 2-point conversion attempt. Tennessee finished the regular season with a 9–3 overall record and a 6–2 record in the SEC Eastern division. They tied with Georgia as champions of the SEC East, however, by virtue of a head- to-head victory over Georgia, the Volunteers were the SEC East representatives in the championship game. Pre-Game Prior to the game, LSU was faced with many distractions. On Friday, November 30, news sources leaked that Nebraska had hired defensive coordinator Bo Pelini to be their new head coach. On the morning of game day, ESPN reported that LSU head coach Les Miles would be announced as the new head coach of Michigan. Later on that day, Les Miles called a press conference to announce that he was would not be leaving LSU to coach Michigan. Also on the minds of the Tigers, quarterback Matt Flynn would not start due to an injury. Instead, Ryan Perrilloux would get the start. Game summary LSU won the game by a score of 21–14, after Erik Ainge threw two interceptions in the 4th quarter.

Background Susan's Girl was bred and owned by Fred W. Hooper. Hooper was born poor on a Southern farm and eventually became rich enough to buy, breed, and run some of the best Thoroughbred horses of his day. His first purchase was Hoop Jr., named after his son, and winner of the 1945 Kentucky Derby. Over the years, Hooper built up a successful stable. Racing career Racing as a two-year-old in 1971, Susan's Girl came up against a top filly called Numbered Account. As a three-year-old, Susan's Girl began to win races, taking nine out of her thirteen starts and never finishing out of the money. That year she was the American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly when Secretariat took both the male honors as well as becoming Horse of the Year. At four, racing on both coasts, Susan's Girl won over $500,000. By the end of the racing season in 1973, Hooper's filly was second only to the filly Shuvee in career earnings. Hooper wanted to see his filly become the first distaffer to win a million dollars. But in February 1974, she chipped a bone in her left foreleg. Hooper sent her to the noted equine surgeon Dr. Robert Copelan. Copelan removed three chips, then sent her home to Hooper's Farm in Ocala, Florida. For two months, Susan's Girl swam in the nearby Lake Weir every day. After nine months, she recovered and returned to the races. At the age of five, Susan's Girl made a comeback. During her recovery, two females had passed the million dollar mark (Dahlia and Allez France), but these were European records. Hooper still hoped for the American record. In November 1974, Susan's Girl won the Falls City Handicap. In 1975, at the age of six, she had her best season in terms of earnings, winning six stakes and placed in eight. In the Matchmaker Stakes in Atlantic City, New Jersey, she set a track record. She beat males as well as older females and made her million plus dollars. Of her 29 wins, 24 came in stakes races. Susan's Girl is the only filly throughout the twentieth century to win a three-year old championship and then two older female championships.

Dispatch boats, which performed their dispatch-carrying duties only on a temporary basis, should not be confused with packet ships—sometimes called packet boats or paquetbots—which were cargo ships which also routinely carried the mail from port to port. Generally, dispatch boats served the military, and paquetbots served commerce. Use of term by the U.S. Navy Dispatch boat was a term used by the United States Navy in its journal accounts to describe boats which carried messages, or mail—otherwise termed dispatches—between high-ranking military officials aboard other ships or to land-based destinations. Dispatch boats during the American Revolution In 1776 the Continental Navy ship Lynch was assigned dispatch boat duty and, after delivering her secret dispatches in France, set sail for the United States with French secret dispatches, only to be captured, but not before destroying the French dispatches.

Lapenotiere in HMS Pickle and Captain Sykes in with the Pickle reaching England first to deliver the dispatches to the Admiralty. For his outstanding effort in the race, Lt. Lapenotiere was awarded the then huge sum of 500 pound sterling cash prize and, in addition, was promoted to Commander. Dispatch boats during the American Civil War The American Civil War employed a large number of dispatch boats, such as , and among numerous others. General Ulysses S. Grant depended on dispatch boats during his Virginia campaign to correspond with Union Navy ships on the James River. Dispatch boats during the late 19th and early 20th centuries The US Navy did not have enough dispatch boats available during the Spanish–American War of 1898, so private yachts and tugboats used by newspapers were frequently tasked by the Navy to carry messages.Milton, Joyce.

Demise of the dispatch boat Dispatch boats became largely unnecessary with the advent of underwater cable and shipboard radio technology in the early 20th century. However, there was a brief reprise during the Falklands War in 1982. CS Iris, a cable laying ship owned by British Telecom, was taken up from trade by the British Government. She ferried supplies and dispatches (including troop's mail from home) between elements of the fleet and between Ascension Island and the Falkland Islands – she also recovered urgent supplies that were air-dropped in the South Atlantic by Royal Air Force, C-130 Hercules aircraft.

It is situated in the former town hall from 1728 next to Viborg Cathedral and holds a collection of works by four generations of the Skovgaard family of artists. The Permanent Collection The main feature of the permanent collection is the work of the members of the Skovgaard family. Peter Christian Skovgaard (1817–1875) was the principal representative of national romantic landscapes of the Golden Age of Danish painting. P. C. Skovgaard married Georgia Skovgaard (1828-1868). Their sons, Joakim Skovgaard (1856–1933) created the mural decorations in Viborg Cathedral and Niels Skovgaard (1858–1938) also worked with landscape painting. However, their work is characterized rather by Symbolism and burgeoning Modernism. The collection holds exquisite examples of landscape painting as well as religious and mythological subjects. The circle of artists surrounding the Skovgaard family is also represented in the museum's collections, with works by, among others, renowned Danish artists Niels Larsen Stevns, Viggo Petersen and Thorvald Bindesbøll. Exhibitions The Skovgaard Museum shows three to four temporary exhibitions a year, ranging from art from the beginning of the nineteenth century to contemporary art. The permanent collection is on display all year round.

Biography Copas was born in Toowoomba, Queensland, and was educated at St. Mary's College and Downlands College. On 23 July 1944, aged 29, he was ordained as Priest of the Order of Missionaries of the Sacred Heart of Jesus by Archbishop Daniel Mannix. Copas studied anthropology and tropical medicine at Sydney University in preparation for missionary work in Papua New Guinea, where he was based at Vunapope, from 1946 to 1951, and also served as a military chaplain from 1945 to 1948. From 1952 to 1954 he was based at Samarai, and then was superior of the Sacred Heart missionaries in the Northern Territory from 1953 to 1960, also serving as a Naval Reserve chaplain, and as chaplain to the leprosarium. On 19 December 1959 he was appointed Vicar Apostolic of Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, and on 15 November 1966 he was appointed Archbishop of Port Moresby. On 19 December 1975, aged 60, he resigned as Archbishop of Port Moresby, but was appointed Archbishop (Personal Title) of Kerema, Papua New Guinea six months later. He resigned this position on 6 December 1988, and died in 1993, aged 78. He was a priest for 49 years and a bishop for 33 years. Alastair McIntosh, who was a Scottish VSO volunteer (1977–80) in St Peter's Extension School which he established at Kerema, records this (presently unpublished) memory of him: :\\"My boss while I was there was Archbishop Virgil Copas. He'd retired from the capital city and had been proud to hand over to the first black archbishop. But instead of going back to Australia he chose to take up an unpopular posting in Gulf Province, one of the poorest parts of the country – a vast malaria swamp fringed with densely forested mountains to the north. He was known as the White Ghost as his lavish crop of white hair and his tall statue was well known. :\\"During my first year, teaching in his school for no-hope kids, I became ever so close to him. He talked only when necessary, and people would complain about having gone for tea with the bishop \\"but he said nothing.\\" The truth was that he substituted words for presence and example. Maybe that was just as well because theologically he was conservative. His so- called \\"archiepiscopal palace\\" – a house made of asbestos-cement boarding – became a dormitory every night for homeless youth. You'd have to step over their bodies on the floor if you paid him a late visit. He simply lived for and with the poor. When people would steal from him, as they sometimes did, he'd say, \\"I hope they needed it more than we did.\\" I saw some people despise him for that kind of attitude. They thought him politically naïve and a bit of an impractical joke. I just saw love, and from time to time I still feel that love as a mentoring hand, even years after his passing.\\" In his twilight years, Archbishop Copas continued to help the PNG people by bringing them to Queensland, Australia for life-changing surgeries. These were people that had touched his heart and who could never hope to get the medical assistance in their home country. These genuinely needy people would arrive on the Gold Coast and see truly amazing sights. His softly-spoken and gentle nature was revered by those that knew him. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1982.

Later, he served at various times as a member of the Planning Commission, as Indian High commissioner to South Africa, as a member of the World Commission on Dams (WCD) and as secretary of the Indian Cooperative Union and the All-India Handicrafts Board. He openly opposed nuclear tests conducted by India which resulted in his position as the ambassador to be terminated. He eventually joined Indian National Congress and was later awarded Padma Vibhushan, the second highest civilian award, by the UPA government. Biography While yet in his youth, Jain took part in the Quit India movement (1942). During the partition of India (1947), he was put in charge of the refugee camp at Kingsway Camp in North Delhi. He helped introduce cooperative societies for farming and cottage industries into rehabilitation camps. As a volunteer organiser with the Indian Cooperative Union (ICU), he joined the rehabilitation project for refugees from Pakistan located in Faridabad, 20 km from Delhi. Jain later helped Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay organise the Indian Cooperative Union and applied its principles to the handicrafts industry. As secretary of the All-India Handicrafts Board, he fostered decentralised production and directed training, technical services, and loans to India's struggling self-employed spinners, weavers, carpenters, and metalsmiths. He applied modern marketing techniques to promote handicrafts sales abroad and organised the Central Cottage Industries Emporium to expand the market at home. He championed artisans against mechanisation and mass production, helping millions of independent craftsmen carry on traditional livelihoods in security and pride and assured the survival of precious arts and skills. Jain became an expert on development, applying unique organizational skills to wed theory to practice. In 1966 he led the establishment of a chain of consumer cooperative stores where those living in cities could buy food, clothing, and tools at a fair price. In 1968 he co-founded a service-oriented consulting firm. By seeking the advice of farmers and workers, Jain and his like-minded colleagues helped government, industry, and nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) design modernisation projects that were relevant and effective. Jain worked with and on a number of development agencies as well as government committees and boards, such as the World Commission on DamsWorld Dam Commission mandate , retrieved 27 November 2007 As part of the ICU, he helped set up the Central Cottage Industries Emporium and Super Bazaar cooperative stores.'Gandhi works, always' By Ashok Gopal infochangeindia.org. Jain's wife was the economist Devaki Jain; the couple had two sons and settled in Bangalore. His son Sreenivasan Jain is a news anchor, journalist, and currently managing editor with NDTV. In 1989, Jain received the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Public Service, for \\"his informed and selfless commitment to attack India's poverty at the grass-roots level\\".Citation Ramon Magsaysay Award website.  Awards  In 2011, he was chosen posthumously for the civilian award Padma Vibhushan by Government of India, but the family declined to accept the award since he had been against the concept of state honours.  Controversies  During his stint as the Indian High Commissioner to South Africa, the Indian Government headed by AB Vajpayee conducted nuclear tests in Pokhran. Jain is opposed to nuclear tests. It is true that LC Jain, who had been appointed by the IK Gujral government, was in fact recalled by the PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee government in 1998. National Security Advisor Brajesh Mishra was reportedly of the opinion that Jain had not effectively defended India's decision to conduct the Pokhran II tests, with reporters like KP Nayar arguing that Jain was against the idea and had communicated this to the South African government. After the Pakistani High Commissioner claimed the tests were a major threat to Pakistan, Jain was asked how he, reacted to the tests. Jain replied that , “nobody in the world can be comfortable with a nuclear device.” According to him, it was this statement that earned the ire of Mishra, who felt he shouldn't have said this and so asked for him to be recalled. In December 2017, Rajiv Mantri made a charge against Jain calling him a certifiable traitor in one of his articles on basis of his support to South Africa's opposition to nuclear tests by India at the NAM summit, later that year. In response to this Jain's son, reporter Sreenivasan Jain sent a defamation notice to Mantri.

Once Charleston, South Carolina, had been captured by Union forces, Gladiolus was employed as a minesweeper and as a salvage ship, clearing obstructions in the harbor.  Purchased at Philadelphia in 1864  Gladiolus, formerly tug Sallie Bishop, was purchased at Philadelphia 2 June 1864 by Commodore C. K. Stribling. She commissioned 15 June 1864, Acting Master J. C.

Dahlgren's South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, and was assigned to Charleston station, arriving 25 June. For the next six months she was actively engaged in towing and coaling ships of the squadron, and served as a night picket boat protecting the powerful ironclads from torpedo and boarding attack. During this period she was also assisted in the capture of several blockade runners. After the capture of Charleston in February 1865, Gladiolus worked in the harbor clearing obstructions and searching for torpedoes (mines).

So I decided to take myself off.\\" *U.S. Boss: July 2–5, 1988. According to Griffin pro racer Cecil Johns lobbied Carlo Lucia, the owner of U.S. Boss, to have Griffin back on the team despite Carlo promising that he would never have him back. Apparently the efforts of Johns paid off and Griffin was back on the team. However, after not liking starting at the bottom of the pecking order of the team he decided to leave Boss after four days after starting secret negotiations with White Bear. > \\"Everyone had their place on the team. I was starting back at the bottom.\\". Another story of as to why he left revcore was according to the November 1988 issue of Super BMX & Freestyle that he was fired from either Revcore or US Boss for forgetting to renew his ABA membership, thus losing all the points accumulated up until that time,Super BMX & Freestyle November 1988 Vol.15 No.11 pg.18 making it highly unlikely for him to defend his 1987 ABA National Cruiser No. 1 title. Darwin's failure to renew his license is a mistake similar to that Ronnie Anderson made in 1983 when he neglected to renew his ABA license and forfeited all his points up until that time.American BMXer November 1985 Vol.7 No.9 pg.27 He was on White Bear by the time of the 1988 Midwest Nationals on July 16–17, 1988.American BMXer August 1988 Vol.10 No.7 pg.39 (results) *White Bear BMX Racing Products: July 5, 1988-May 1989 He began secret negotiations with White Bear's representative Lonnie Means the last day he was on Boss, with a contract package which included Griffin getting his own signature frame and fork.

The group consisted of Anders \\"Flanders\\" Molin (accordion, music box), Martin \\"MacGyver\\" Molin (glockenspiel, traktofon, toy piano, Theremin), Jon Nils Emanuel Ekström (drums, sound box, small bells), and later on, Marcus Sjöberg (drums). The three members grew up in the city of Karlstad, Sweden, located in Värmland County, but they did not form a band until they had moved to Gothenburg in 2005. The usage of more unusual instruments such as the accordion was inspired both by its prominent use in the soundtrack for Amélie as well as musical traditions in Värmland. As the band also played as street musicians there was originally also a requirement to have portable instruments such as the glockenspiel. Between 2006 and 2008 the band toured extensively and also participated in several Swedish radio and TV shows including a program at MTV Europe. On September 3, 2008, Detektivbyrån released their first full-length album, Wermland. The band was nominated for two Grammis awards, as newcomer of the year https://grammis.se/nominated_year/2009/page/2/ and folk music of the year https://grammis.se/nominated_year/2009 in 2009. In addition they were also nominated for an award at Manifestgalan as the best live act of 2008. In February 2009, Jon Nils Emanuel Ekström left the band, Marcus Sjöberg took his place, leaving the band still working on the future album tentatively named \\"Beyond\\". Ekström had previously been playing drums, sound box, small bells on the band's albums and concerts. The band had also recently been contributing to the soundtrack of the American film Tenure. In August 2010, the band was dissolved and clearly stated on their official website that they would not make any more music or live performances under the name Detektivbyrån.

The incidence of neonatal teeth varies considerably, between 1:700 and 1:30,000 depending on the type of study; the highest prevalence is found in the only study that relies on personal examination of patients. Natal teeth, and neonatal teeth, can be the baby's normal deciduous teeth, sprouting prematurely. These should be preserved, if possible. Alternately, they could be supernumary teeth, extra teeth, not part of the normal allotment of teeth. Signs and symptoms Most often natal teeth are mandibular central incisors. They have little root structure and are attached to the end of the gum by soft tissue and are often mobile. Causes Most of the time, natal teeth are not related to a medical condition. However, sometimes they may be associated with: * Ellis–van Creveld syndrome * Hallermann–Streiff syndrome * Pierre Robin syndrome * Sotos syndrome Treatment No intervention is usually recommended unless they are causing difficulty to the infant or mother. However some recommend that they be removed as the tooth can cut or amputate the tip of the tongue. They should be left in the mouth as long as possible to decrease the likelihood of removing permanent tooth buds with the natal tooth. They should also not be removed if the infant has hypoprothrombinemia. In case of complications when the natal teeth need to be removed, dental radiographs should be obtained whenever possible, and evaluated and followed up with pediatric dentists.

It was codified by the Entail Act 1685. (entry \\"tailyie\\") Tailzie is similar to the common law concept of fee tail, as the \\"heir in tailzie\\" is entailed to the property. An \\"heir in tailzie\\" could not sell the property so inherited, except to the feu superior (that is, to the holder of the dominum directum of the feu). Alternate spellings of the word are tailie, taillie, tailze, tailyie, tailye, taylzie, teally, teilzie, telyie, teylyie tyle, talyee. It is derived from the Old French tailler (to cut) and taille (a cutting). The 'z' was until the simplification of printing to 26 characters a yogh (tailȝie) and so is not sounded. Additional explanations The Entail Amendment Act 1848 gave all heirs in tailzie power to apply to the Court of Session to cease the deed of tailzie, compensate respective claims, thus take estate possession in fee simple. Part 5 of the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 disentailed all entailed land in Scotland and required the Keeper of the Registers of Scotland to close the Register of Entails.

A series of \\"national-liberal\\" political parties, by ideology or just by name, were especially active in Europe in the 19th century in several national contexts such as Central Europe, the Nordic countries, and Southeastern Europe. Definitions National liberalism was primarily an ideology and a movement of the 19th century. National-liberal goals were the pursuit of individual and economic freedom, as well as national sovereignty.Lothar Gall und Dieter Langewiesche - Liberalismus und Region, München 1995, pp. 4–10. József Antall, a historian and Christian democrat who served as the first post-communist Prime Minister of Hungary, described national liberalism as \\"part and parcel of the emergence of the nation state\\" in 19th-century Europe. According to Oskar Mulej, \\"in terms of both ideologies and political party traditions it may be argued that in the Central European lands a distinct type of liberalism, peculiar to this region evolved through the nineteenth century\\" and citing Maciej Janowski, \\"the word 'national' acted as more or less synonymous with 'liberal'\\" (\\"'national' alone was sufficient to arouse suspicions of liberal associations\\").Maciej Janowski, \\"Wavering Friendship : liberal and national ideas in nineteenth century East-Central Europe\\", Ab Imperio, 3–4 (2000), 69–90, 80. Also according to Mulej, in Southeast Europe \\"'national liberals' also played visible if not central roles, but with rather different, region-specific characteristics, which to a considerable extent distinguished them from their Central European counterparts.\\" In his book Up From Conservatism, Michael Lind defines national liberalism in a way that The Progressive describes as matching historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.'s use of the expression \\"Vital Center\\". Lind himself defines national liberalism as uniting \\"moderate social conservatism with moderate economic liberalism\\". Gordon Smith, a leading scholar of comparative European politics, understands national liberalism as a political concept that lost popularity when the success of nationalist movements in creating nation states rendered it no longer necessary to specify that a liberal ideal, party or politician was \\"national\\".\\"Between Left and Right: The Ambivalence of European Liberalism,\\" pp. 16–28, in Liberal Parties in Western Europe, Emil J. Kirchner, ed., Cambridge University Press, 1988, . History The roots of national liberalism are to be found in the 19th century, when conservative liberalism and/or classical liberalism was the ideology of the political classes in most European countries and in particular those of Central Europe, then governed by hereditary monarchies. At their origin, national liberals, although pro-business, were not necessarily advocates of free trade and economic liberalism per se and sometimes favoured cooperation between the government and the national industry, moderate levels of protectionism, the establishment of preferential custom unions, subsidies for infant industry or companies considered of national strategic importance and various forms of industrial planning. National liberalism was popular in a number of countries including Germany, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Romania during the 19th century.Kurunmaki, Jussi. \\"On the Difficulty of Being a National Liberal in Nineteenth-Century Finland\\". Contributions to the History of Concepts, vol. 8, no. 2, 2013, pp. 83–95., https://www.jstor.org/stable/43610946. In Germany, Austria and Romania, national liberals and/or \\"National Liberal\\" parties were long in government. More specifically, in German-speaking countries national liberals were also in favour of a more authoritarian or conservative political regime because of the multi-ethnic character or heterogeneous nature of countries like the Austrian Empire (later officially renamed Austria-Hungary) or the newly created Germany under Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. Germany In 19th-century Germany, believers in national liberalism differed from liberal nationalists in that they believed in a more authoritarian presence in Europe and a strong German Empire. Liberal nationalists, such as Max Weber, were looking towards a democratic Germany in cooperation with the other European powers. At the time of the German Empire, national liberalism was represented by the National Liberal Party (NLP), the largest in the Reichstag for several years. National Liberals supported Bismarck, who served as Chancellor from 1871 (unification of Germany) to 1890, until the late 1870s when the Chancellor reversed his early free trade policies, became a proponent of protectionism, opposed increasing parliamentary powers and ultimately pandered for the support of the German Conservative Party (largely representing the wealthy landowning elite Junkers of Prussia). Additionally, the NLP (which had obtained around 30% in the first three federal elections, including 30.1% in the 1871 federal election) suffered huge losses in the 1878 federal election and especially the 1881 federal election (when it was reduced to 14.6%). Later, the party experienced a steady decline in its share of vote, contextually with the rise of the Social Democratic Party and the Centre Party at the turn of the century. During the Weimar Republic, the NLP was succeeded by the German People's Party (DVP), whose main leader was Gustav Stresemann, Chancellor (1923) and Minister of Foreign Affairs (1923–1929). The DVP, which was joined by some moderate elements of the Free Conservative Party (FKP) and the Economic Union (WV),Vincent E McHale (1983) Political parties of Europe, Greenwood Press, p421 was generally thought to represent the interests of the great German industrialists and has been classified as a national-liberal party by several observers. Its platform stressed Christian family values, secular education, lower tariffs, opposition to welfare spending and agrarian subsidies and hostility to \\"Marxism\\" (that is to say, both the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party). After Stresemann's death, the DVP, whose ranks included several anti-republicans, veered sharply to the right. The current Free Democratic Party (FDP), which was the joint successor of the DVP and the social liberal German Democratic Party (DDP), originally featured conservative and partly nationalist efforts, which were particularly strong in some state associations until the 1950sGert-Joachim Glaeßner: Politik in Deutschland, VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften 2006, p. 457 and more occasionally after that (an interesting example is that of Jürgen Möllemann, FDP leader in North Rhine-Westphalia in 1983–1994 and 1996–2002)http://www.untag- smd.ac.id/files/Perpustakaan_Digital_2/POLITICS%20AND%20GOVERNMENT%20The%20Politics%20of%20the%20Nazi%20Past%20in%20Germany%20and%20Austria.pdf and still includes a national-liberal faction, which holds a consistently Eurosceptic position, differently from the rest of the party. Some right-wing elements, including Sven Tritschler (former leader of the Stresemann Club), have more recently joined the Alternative for Germany (AfD), which has in turn been characterised by some observers as national liberal. Austria In Austria-Hungary, the Constitutional Party was the main representative of national liberalism. In Austria, national liberalism has remained the basis of one of the three Lager, or ideological camps, in the country, dating back to the Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire. During the interwar period, the national-liberal camp was gathered into the Greater German People's Party. By 1938, with the Anschluss of Austria into Nazi Germany, the national-liberal camp had been swallowed whole by Austrian National Socialism and all other parties were eventually absorbed into Nazi totalitarianism. Both Socialists and Christian Socials were persecuted under the Nazi regime and the national- liberal camp was scarred after the war due to guilt by association with National Socialism. In 1949, the Federation of Independents (VdU) was founded as a national-liberal alternative to the main Austrian parties. It incorporated an array of political movements, including free market liberals, populists, former Nazis and German nationalists, all of whom had been unable to join either of the two main parties. The VdU evolved into the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) in 1955–1956. When Jörg Haider was chosen as new FPÖ leader in 1986, the party started an ideological turn towards right-wing populism, which resulted in the split of most liberals, who formed the Liberal Forum (LiF), which took over the FPÖ's membership in the Liberal International and would later eventually merge into NEOS. Haider himself would split from the party and form the Alliance for the Future of Austria in 2005. Denmark In Denmark, from the 1830s the core concept of national liberalism was that the nation and the state should have the same extent. National liberals supported the union the Kingdom of Denmark and the Duchy of Schleswig under a common constitutional framework. On the economy, the state should not interfere with trade and the national-liberal economic vision was transposed in the 1857 Law on Freedom of Business, which abolished the last remnants of the feudal monopolies which had previously formed the framework for the craft of the cities. Danish national liberals supported Scandinavism and thus Scandinavian unity. Sweden In Sweden, in the 1860s liberals described themselves as national liberals (nationalliberaler) and constituted a coalition of monarchists and liberal reformists in support of parliamentary reforms. Swedish national liberals also supported Scandinavism. Finland In the Grand Duchy of Finland, an autonomous part of the Russian Empire, where as many as 80% of the population was Protestant and Finnish-speaking, somewhat under 20% Protestant Swedish speakers (Sweden ruled Finland until 1809) and a small number Russian Orthodox, the term \\"national liberal\\" was used by the elite Swedish-speakers of the Svecoman movement who advocated liberal ideals, but wanted to keep Swedish as the dominant language, an idea opposed by Finnish-speaking nationalists of the Fennoman movement. The Svecoman movement gave birth to the Swedish Party, which was later renamed Swedish People's Party in Finland, which has since moved to mainstream liberalism and social liberalism and is often a party of government in the country. Russia In Russia, \\"national liberalism\\" was a 1990s movement claiming to be redefining \\"liberal\\" principles as understood in the Western tradition to produce a \\"national liberalism\\" better suited to Russian culture, being practically a variety of Russian nationalism. Romania In Romania, the National Liberal Party (PNL), founded in 1875, revived in 1990 and enlarged in 2014 (when it absorbed the Democratic Liberal Party, PDL), has also been part of the national-liberal tradition. Today, it is one of the country's two main parties. President Klaus Iohannis hails from it. The PNL is now mainly liberal-conservative and pro-Europeanist placed on the centre-right of the political spectrum concerning economy, society, culture, freedom of expression, and civil liberties. Slovakia Freedom and Solidarity (SaS), the liberal and libertarian main opposition party after the 2016 parliamentary election in Slovakia, has been shifting from liberalism to Euroscepticism and nationalism and/or combining liberalism and nationalism. As a fact, SaS is not a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party, but of the Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe, along with conservative and Eurosceptic parties. SaS leader Richard Sulík described himself both as a liberal and as a nationalist, but later corrected himself by saying that he was a liberal and a patriot while condemning chauvinism, racism and religious fanaticism and opposing the withdrawal of Slovakia from the European Union. However, the party has never been classified as national- liberal by third-party sources. Czech Republic In Austria-Hungary the Young Czech Party, emerged in 1874 after a split from the Old Czech Party, was a national-liberal force. During Czechoslovakia's era (1918–1992), a few parties were described as national-liberal: Czechoslovak National Democracy, the National Labour Party and, after 1989, the Czech National Social Party. Today, the conservative Civic Democratic Party (ODS) in the Czech Republic has been described as a national-liberal party. The ODS is a member of the Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe, as Slovakia's Freedom and Solidarity, and the International Democrat Union. Israel Since 1973, the Likud National Liberal Movement operates in Israel as the main centre-right and Zionist political party in the country.

XA-XE After the finds went to the Manchester Museum, Margaret Murray published a monograph on this tomb group.Margaret Alice Murray: The tomb of two brothers, Manchster 1910 The burial chamber of the two individuals was found in a small chamber placed within the courtyard of a bigger tomb, perhaps once belonging to a governor buried at Deir Rifeh. The chamber tomb contained a set of two coffins, one outer wooden box coffin and one inner anthropoid coffin for each of the tomb owners. The coffins are decorated on the outside with a palace facade motif and several text lines. The coffins and the texts are very close to coffins found at Asyut and it seems possible that they were produced there.Marcel Zitman: The Necropolis of Assiut, A Case Study of Local Egyptian Funerary Cul-ture from the Old Kingdom to the End of the Middle Kingdom, Text (Orientalia Lovaniensia Analecta 180), Leuven, Paris, Walpole MA, 2010, , pp. 346-347.  Coffins of Nakht-Ankh  The rectangular outer coffin bears on the lid three text columns. On the long sides there are four double columns on each side. At the top of the long sides there are two horizontal text lines. The short ends have two columns and again two horizontal text lines. On the lid Nakht-Ankh bears the title son of a governor and is called begotten of Khnumaa. The middle text column is an offering formula addressing Anubis with the wish that the deceased may cross with a ferry, that he might be buried and that he might ascend to the great god. The other spell expressed the wish that Nakht-Ankh might sit in the boat of the sun god, that will cross the heaven. Evidently the spell made sure that Nakht-Ankh will be in the circle of deities after death. The third spell on the lid finally expresses the wish that the deceased becomes the son of the sky goddess Nut to be under her protection.David: The Two Brothers, Death and Afterlife in Middle Kingdom Egypt, pp. 70-72 The texts on the coffin box have different functions. Some of the spells are part of the modern corpus of Coffin Texts (on the coffin there are the coffin text spells 30, 31, 32, 609 and 345). Interestingly, the coffin is almost identical to the coffin of a certain Djefahapy that was found at Asyut.Zitman: The Necropolis of Assiut Volume I, p. 346.  Further objects in the burial  Next to the coffins was found a canopic box with four canopic vessels. There were three statuettes of the tomb owners. Also, some wooden models of servants, models of boats and some pottery vessels. The whole tomb group is now in the Manchester Museum. The tomb group is one of the best preserved and best known burials of the Egyptian Middle Kingdom.  The tomb owners  Nakht-ankh and Khnum-nakht are only known from this burial. They are not attested for sure from other sources. Nakht-Ankh bears as only title the designation son of a governor. He is also called begotten of Khnumaa. Khnum- Nakht bears the titles son of governor, son of the son of a governor and wab- priest of Khnum, lord of Shashotep. He is also called begotten of Khnumaa.Zitman: The Necropolis of Assiut Volume II, p. 192. Their mummies were found heavily decayed. Ancient DNA Ancient DNA analysis of the mummies of Nakht-Ankh and Khnum-Nakht, which were entombed at the Deir Rifeh cemetery, found that the brothers belonged to the M1a1 mtDNA haplogroup with 88.05–91.27% degree of confidence, thus confirming the African (Egyptian) origins of the two individuals. The analysis also made it possible to establish that the two titular brothers were actually half brothers, having the same mother but different fathers.

Monroe, the fifth United States president, took office after winning the 1816 presidential election by an overwhelming margin over Federalist Rufus King. This election was the last in which the Federalists fielded a presidential candidate, and Monroe was unopposed in the 1820 presidential election. A member of the Democratic-Republican Party, Monroe was succeeded by Secretary of State John Quincy Adams. Monroe sought to eliminate political parties, and the Federalist Party faded as a national institution during his presidency. The Democratic-Republicans also stopped functioning as a unified political party, and the period during which Monroe served as president is often referred to as the \\"Era of Good Feelings\\" due to the lack of partisan conflict. Domestically, Monroe faced the Panic of 1819, the first major recession in the United States since the ratification of the Constitution. He supported many federally-funded infrastructure projects, but vetoed other projects due to constitutional concerns. Monroe supported the Missouri Compromise, which admitted Missouri as a slave state but excluded slavery in the remaining territories north of the parallel 36°30′ north. In foreign policy, Monroe and Secretary of State Adams acquired East Florida from Spain with the Adams–Onís Treaty, realizing a long-term goal of Monroe and his predecessors. Reached after the First Seminole War, the Adams–Onís Treaty also solidified U.S. control over West Florida, established the western border of the United States, and included the cession of Spain's claims on Oregon Country. The Monroe administration also reached two treaties with Britain, marking a rapprochement between the two countries after the War of 1812. The Rush–Bagot Treaty demilitarized the U.S. border with British North America, while the Treaty of 1818 settled some boundary disputes and provided for the joint settlement of Oregon Country. Monroe was deeply sympathetic to the revolutionary movements in Latin America and opposed European influence in the region. In 1823, Monroe promulgated the Monroe Doctrine, which declared that the U.S. would remain neutral in European affairs, but would not accept new colonization of Latin America by European powers. In the 1824 presidential election, four members of the Democratic-Republican Party sought to succeed Monroe, who remained neutral among the candidates. Adams emerged as the victor over General Andrew Jackson and Secretary of the Treasury William H. Crawford in a contingent election. Polls of historians and political scientists have generally ranked Monroe as an above-average president. Election of 1816 1816 electoral vote results. Monroe's war-time leadership in the Madison administration had established him as the Democratic-Republican heir apparent, but not all party leaders supported Monroe's candidacy in the lead-up to the 1816 presidential election. Secretary of the Treasury William H. Crawford had the support of numerous Southern and Western Congressmen, many of whom were wary of Madison and Monroe's support for the establishment of the Second Bank of the United States. New York Democratic-Republicans resisted the possibility of another Virginian winning the presidency, and they backed the candidacy of Governor Daniel D. Tompkins. Though Crawford desired the nomination, he did not strongly oppose Monroe's candidacy, as he hoped to position himself to succeed Monroe in 1820 or 1824. In the congressional nominating caucus held in March 1816, Monroe defeated Crawford in a 65-to-54 vote, becoming his party's presidential nominee. Tompkins won the party's vice presidential nomination. The moribund Federalist Party nominated Rufus King as their presidential nominee, but the Federalists offered little opposition following the conclusion of the War of 1812, which they had opposed. Some opponents of Monroe tried to recruit DeWitt Clinton, Madison's opponent in the 1812 election, but Clinton declined to enter the race. Monroe received 183 of the 217 electoral votes, winning every state but Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Delaware. In the concurrent congressional elections, Democratic-Republicans picked up several seats in the House of Representatives, leaving them with control of over three quarters of the chamber. Monroe was the last president called a Founding Father of the United States, and also the last president of the \\"Virginia dynasty\\", a term sometimes used to describe the fact that four of the nation's first five presidents were from Virginia. Administration Monroe presiding over a cabinet meeting in 1823. Monroe appointed a geographically-balanced cabinet, through which he led the executive branch. At Monroe's request, Crawford continued to serve as Treasury Secretary. Monroe also chose to retain Benjamin Crowninshield of Massachusetts as Secretary of the Navy and Richard Rush of Pennsylvania as Attorney General. Recognizing Northern discontent at the continuation of the Virginia dynasty, Monroe chose John Quincy Adams of Massachusetts to fill the prestigious post of Secretary of State, making Adams the early favorite to eventually succeed Monroe as president. An experienced diplomat, Adams had abandoned the Federalist Party in 1807 in support of Thomas Jefferson's foreign policy, and Monroe hoped that the appointment of Adams would encourage the defection of more Federalists. Monroe offered the position of Secretary of War to Henry Clay of Kentucky, but Clay was only willing to serve in the cabinet as Secretary of State. Monroe's decision to appoint Adams to the latter position alienated Clay, and Clay would oppose many of the administration's policies. After General Andrew Jackson and Governor Isaac Shelby declined appointment as Secretary of War, Monroe turned to South Carolina Congressman John C. Calhoun, leaving the cabinet without a prominent Westerner. In late 1817, Rush was appointed as the ambassador to Britain, and William Wirt succeeded him as Attorney General. With the exception of the Crowninshield, Monroe's cabinet appointees remained in place for the remainder of his presidency. Judicial appointments In September 1823, Secretary of the Navy Smith Thompson received a recess appointment from President Monroe to a seat on the Supreme Court that had been vacated by Henry Brockholst Livingston. Officially nominated for the same seat on December 5, 1823, he was confirmed by the United States Senate on December 9. Thompson was on good personal terms with Monroe, had a long record of public service as a jurist and a public official, and, like Livingston, hailed from the state of New York. Monroe also considered Senator Martin Van Buren and jurists Ambrose Spencer and James Kent for the nomination. Thompson was Monroe's lone appointment to the Supreme Court, though Monroe also appointed 21 judges to United States district courts during his presidency. Domestic affairs Democratic-Republican Party dominance Independence Day Celebration in Centre Square (1819) by John Lewis Kimmel exemplifies the spirit of the \\"Era of Good Feelings\\" Like all four of his predecessors, Monroe believed that the existence of political parties was harmful to the United States, and he made the elimination of political parties a major goal of his presidency. He sought to strengthen the Democratic-Republican Party by avoiding divisive policies and welcoming ex-Federalists into the fold, with the ultimate aim being the dissolution of the Federalists. Monroe made two long national tours to build national trust. At Boston, his 1817 visit was hailed as the beginning of an \\"Era of Good Feelings.\\" Frequent stops on these tours allowed innumerable ceremonies of welcome and expressions of good will. Monroe was seen by more Americans than any previous president, and his travels were detailed in the local and national press. The Federalists failed to develop a unified national program, and Federalist candidates frequently campaigned on local rather than national issues. The Federalists maintained their organizational integrity in Delaware and a few localities, but lacked influence in national politics. Lacking serious opposition, the Democratic- Republican Party's congressional caucus stopped meeting, and for practical purposes the Democratic-Republican Party stopped operating.Arthur Meier Schlesinger, Jr., ed. History of U.S. political parties: Volume 1 (1973) pp. 24–25, 267 Panic of 1819 Two years into his presidency, Monroe faced an economic crisis known as the Panic of 1819, the first major depression to hit the country since the ratification of the Constitution in 1788. The panic stemmed from declining imports and exports, and sagging agricultural prices as global markets readjusted to peacetime production and commerce after the War of 1812 and the Napoleonic Wars. The severity of the economic downturn in the U.S. was compounded by excessive speculation in public lands, fueled by the unrestrained issue of paper money from banks and business concerns. The Second Bank of the United States (B.U.S.) failed to restrict inflation until late 1818, when the directors of the B.U.S. took overdue steps to curtail credit. Branches were ordered to accept no bills but their own, to present all state bank notes for payment immediately, and to renew no personal notes or mortgages. These contractionary fiscal policies backfired, as they undermined public confidence in banks and contributed to the onset of the panic. Monroe had little control over economic policy; in the early 19th century, such power rested largely with the states and the B.U.S. As the panic spread, Monroe declined to call a special session of Congress to address the economy. When Congress finally reconvened in December 1819, Monroe requested an increase in the tariff but declined to recommend specific rates. Congress would not raise tariff rates until the passage of the Tariff of 1824. The panic resulted in high unemployment, an increase in bankruptcies and foreclosures, and provoked popular resentment against banking and business enterprises. Popular resentment towards the national bank motivated the state of Maryland to implement a tax on the national bank's branch in that state. Shortly afterwards, the Supreme Court handed down its decision in McCulloch v. Maryland. In a major defeat for states' rights advocates, the Supreme Court forbade states from taxing B.U.S. branches. In his majority opinion, Chief Justice John Marshall articulated a broad reading of the Necessary and Proper Clause, holding that the Constitution granted Congress powers that were not expressly defined. The decision fed the popular disdain for the B.U.S. and aroused fears about the growing reach of federal power. Missouri Compromise Beginning in 1818, Clay and territorial delegate John Scott sought the admission of Missouri Territory as a state. The House failed to act on the bill before Congress adjourned in April, but took up the issue again after Congress reconvened in December 1818. During these proceedings, Congressman James Tallmadge, Jr. of New York \\"tossed a bombshell into the Era of Good Feelings\\" by offering amendments (known collectively as the Tallmadge Amendment) prohibiting the further introduction of slaves into Missouri, and requiring that all children subsequently born therein of slave parents should be free at the age of twenty-five years. The amendments sparked the most significant national slavery debate since the ratification of the Constitution, and instantly exposed the sectional polarization over the issue of slavery. Northern Democratic-Republicans formed a coalition across partisan lines with remnants of the Federalists in support of the exclusion of slavery from Missouri and all future states and territories, while Southern Democratic-Republicans were almost unanimously against such a restriction. Northerners focused their arguments on the immorality of slavery, while Southerners focused their attacks on the purported unconstitutionality of banning slavery within a state. A few southerners such as former President Jefferson, argued that the \\"diffusion\\" of slaves into the west would make gradual emancipation more feasible. Most southern whites, however, favored diffusion because it would help prevent slave rebellions. Both sides also recognized that the status of slavery in Missouri could have important consequences on the balance between slave states and free states in the United States Senate. The Missouri Compromise prohibited slavery in the unorganized territory of the Great Plains (upper dark green), but permitted it in Missouri (yellow) and the Arkansas Territory (lower blue area). The bill, with Tallmadge’s amendments, passed the House in a mostly sectional vote, though ten free state congressmen joined with the slave state congressmen in opposing at least one of the provisions of the bill. The measure then went to the Senate, where both amendments were rejected. A House–Senate conference committee was unable to resolve the disagreements on the bill, and so the whole measure was lost. Congress took up the issue again when it reconvened in December 1819. Monroe, himself a slaveowner, threatened to veto any bill that restricted slavery in Missouri. He also supported the efforts of Senator James Barbour and other Southern Congressmen to win the admission of Missouri as a slave state by threatening to withhold statehood from Maine, which was at the time a part of Massachusetts. In February 1820, Congressman Jesse B. Thomas of Illinois proposed a compromise: Missouri would be admitted as a slave state, but slavery would be excluded in the remaining territories north of the parallel 36°30′ north. Like many other Southern leaders, Monroe came to view Thomas's proposal as the least damaging outcome for southern slaveholders. With assistance from national bank president Nicholas Biddle, Monroe used his influence and power of patronage to line up support behind Thomas's proposal. The Senate passed a bill that included Thomas's territorial restriction on slavery, and which also provided for the admittance of Maine and Missouri. The House approved the Senate bill in a narrow vote, and after deliberating with his cabinet, Monroe signed the legislation into law in April 1820. The question of the final admission of Missouri came up again in November 1820. The Missouri constitution included a provision that barred free blacks from entering the state, which many northerners deemed unconstitutional. The dispute over Missouri affected the 1820 presidential election, and Congress reported electoral vote totals both with and without Missouri's votes. Through the influence of Clay, an act of admission was finally passed, upon the condition that the exclusionary clause of the Missouri constitution should \\"never be construed to authorize the passage of any law\\" impairing the privileges and immunities of any U.S. citizen. This deliberately ambiguous provision is sometimes known as the Second Missouri Compromise.Dixon, 1899 pp. 116–117 It was a bitter pill for many to swallow and the admission of new states as free or slave became a major issue until the abolition of slavery. Aside from settling the issue of Missouri's statehood, the Missouri Compromise had several important effects. It helped forestall a split in the Democratic- Republican Party along sectional lines at a time when the Federalists offered little effective opposition, and set a precedent whereby free states and slave states were admitted in pairs to avoid upsetting the balance of the Senate. The compromise also elevated the stature of both Henry Clay and the United States Senate. Perhaps most importantly, the Missouri Compromise indicated a shift away from gradual emancipation, a policy that had once held wide support among Southern leaders. The planned slave revolt of Denmark Vesey, who was captured and executed in 1822, further contributed to a hardening of pro- slavery attitudes in the South during Monroe's tenure as president.John Craig Hammond, \\"President, Planter, Politician: James Monroe, the Missouri Crisis, and the Politics of Slavery.\\" Journal of American History 105.4 (2019): 843-867. online. Internal improvements As the United States continued to grow, many Americans advocated the construction of a system of internal improvements to help the country develop. Federal assistance for such projects evolved slowly and haphazardly—the product of contentious congressional factions and an executive branch that was concerned about the constitutionality of federal involvement with such projects. Monroe believed that the young nation needed to improve its infrastructure to grow and thrive economically, but also worried about the constitutionality of a federal role in the construction, maintenance, and operation of a national transportation system. Monroe repeatedly urged Congress to pass an amendment allowing Congress the power to finance internal improvements, but Congress never acted on his proposal. Many congressmen believed that the Constitution already allowed the federal financing of internal improvements. The United States had begun construction on the National Road in 1811, and by the end of 1818 it linked the Ohio River and the Potomac River. In 1822, Congress passed a bill authorizing the collection of tolls to finance repairs on the road. Adhering to his stated position regarding internal improvements, Monroe vetoed the bill. In an elaborate essay, Monroe set forth his constitutional views on the subject. Congress might appropriate money, he admitted, but it could not undertake the actual construction of national works nor assume jurisdiction over them. In 1823, Monroe proposed that Congress work with the states to build a system of canals to connect the rivers leading to the Atlantic Ocean with the western territories of the United States, and he eventually signed a bill providing for investment in the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal Company. Monroe's call for canals was inspired by the impending completion of the Erie Canal, which would link New York City with the Great Lakes. In 1824, the Supreme Court ruled in Gibbons v. Ogden that the Constitution's Commerce Clause gave the federal government broad authority over interstate commerce. Shortly thereafter, Congress passed two important laws that, together, marked the beginning of the federal government's continuous involvement in civil works. The General Survey Act authorized the president to have surveys made of routes for roads and canals \\"of national importance.\\" The president assigned responsibility for the surveys to the Army Corps of Engineers. The second act, passed a month later, appropriated $75,000 to improve navigation on the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers by removing sandbars, snags, and other obstacles. Subsequently, the act was amended to include other rivers such as the Missouri. Other issues and events In the years before Monroe took office, a movement supporting the colonization of Africa by free blacks became increasingly popular. Congressman Charles F. Mercer of Virginia and Reverend Robert Finley of New Jersey established the American Colonization Society (ACS) to further the goal of African colonization. Most adherents of the society supported colonization to provide for the gradual emancipation of slaves and diversify the Southern economy, but the ACS also appealed to pro- slavery Southerners whose primarily goal was the removal of free blacks from the country. The ACS attracted several prominent supporters, including Madison, Associate Justice Bushrod Washington, and Henry Clay. In 1819, the Monroe administration agreed to provide some funding to the ACS, and, much like the national bank, the society operated as a public-private partnership. The U.S. Navy helped the ACS establish a colony in West Africa, which would be adjacent to Sierra Leone, another colony that had been established for free blacks. The new colony was named Liberia, and Liberia's capital took the name of Monrovia in honor of President Monroe. By the 1860s, over ten thousand African Americans had migrated to Liberia. Though initially intended to be a permanent U.S. colony, Liberia would declare independence in 1847. Monroe took a close interest in the Western American frontier, which was overseen by Secretary of War Calhoun. Calhoun organized an expedition to the Yellowstone River to extend American influence in and knowledge of the northwest region of the Louisiana Purchase. The expedition suffered several setbacks, but the efforts of scientists such as Edwin James advanced U.S. knowledge of the flora and fauna of the region. The federal government had taken control of the Yazoo lands from Georgia in the Compact of 1802; as part of that agreement, President Jefferson promised to remove Native Americans from the region. Georgians pressed Monroe to remove the remaining Native Americans to regions west of the Mississippi River, but the Native Americans rejected the Monroe administration's offers to purchase their land. As Monroe was unwilling to forcibly evict the Native American tribes, he took no major actions regarding Indian removal. Foreign affairs Treaties with Great Britain Near the beginning of Monroe's first term, the administration negotiated two important accords with Great Britain that resolved border disputes held over from the War of 1812. The Rush-Bagot Treaty, signed in April 1817, regulated naval armaments on the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain, demilitarizing the border between the U.S. and British North America. The Treaty of 1818, signed in October 1818, fixed the present Canada–United States border from Minnesota to the Rocky Mountains at the 49th parallel. Britain ceded all of Rupert's Land south of the 49th parallel and east of the Continental Divide, including all of the Red River Colony south of that latitude, while the U.S. ceded the northernmost edge of the Missouri Territory above the 49th parallel. The treaty also established a joint U.S.–British occupation of Oregon Country for the next ten years. Together, the Rush-Bagot Treaty and the Treaty of 1818 marked an important turning point in Anglo–American and American–Canadian relations, although they did not solve all outstanding issues. The easing of tensions contributed to expanded trade, particularly cotton, and played a role in Britain's decision to refrain from becoming involved in the First Seminole War. Spanish Florida =Seminole Wars= Spain faced a troubling colonial situation after the Napoleonic Wars, as revolutionaries in Central America and South America were beginning to demand independence. The United States had taken control of part of West Florida in 1810, and, by the time Monroe took office, American settlers also encroached on Spanish territory in East Florida and New Spain. With a minor military presence in the Floridas, Spain was unable to restrain the Seminole Indians, who routinely conducted cross-border raids on American villages and farms and protected slave refugees from the United States. Acquisition of the Floridas was a long-held goal of Monroe, Adams, and other leading Democratic-Republicans, as authority over the region would consolidate U.S. control of its southeastern lands against British and Spanish influence. To stop the Seminole from raiding Georgia settlements and offering havens for runaway slaves, the U.S. Army led increasingly frequent incursions into Spanish territory. In early 1818, Monroe ordered General Andrew Jackson to the Georgia–Florida border to defend against Seminole attacks. Monroe authorized Jackson to attack Seminole encampments in Spanish Florida, but not Spanish settlements themselves. In what became known as the First Seminole War, Jackson crossed over into Spanish territory and attacked the Spanish fort at St. Marks. He also executed two British subjects whom he accused of having incited the Seminoles to raid American settlements. Jackson claimed that the attack on the fort was necessary as the Spanish were providing aid to the Seminoles. After taking the fort St. Marks, Jackson moved on the Spanish position at Pensacola, capturing it in May 1818. In a letter to Jackson, Monroe reprimanded the general for exceeding his orders, but also acknowledged that Jackson may have been justified given the circumstances in the war against the Seminoles. Though he had not authorized Jackson's attacks on Spanish posts, Monroe recognized that Jackson's campaign left the United States with a stronger hand in ongoing negotiations over the purchase of the Floridas, as it showed that Spain was unable to defend its territories. The Monroe administration restored the Floridas to Spain, but requested that Spain increase efforts to prevent Seminole raids. Some in Monroe's cabinet, including Secretary of War John Calhoun, wanted the aggressive general court- martialed, or at least reprimanded. Secretary of State Adams alone took the ground that Jackson's acts were justified by the incompetence of Spanish authority to police its own territory, arguing that Spain had allowed East Florida to become \\"a derelict open to the occupancy of every enemy, civilized or savage, of the United States, and serving no other earthly purpose than as a post of annoyance to them.\\"Alexander Deconde, A History of American Foreign Policy (1963) p. 127 His arguments, along with the restoration of the Floridas, convinced the British and Spanish not to retaliate against the United States for Jackson's conduct. News of Jackson's exploits caused consternation in Washington and ignited a congressional investigation. Clay attacked Jackson's actions and proposed that his colleagues officially censure the general. Even many members of Congress who tended to support Jackson worried about the consequences of allowing a general to make war without the consent of Congress. In reference to popular generals who had taken power through military force, Speaker of the House Henry Clay urged his fellow congressmen to \\"remember that Greece had her Alexander, Rome her Julius Caesar, England her Cromwell, France her Bonaparte.\\" Dominated by Democratic- Republicans, the 15th Congress was generally expansionist and supportive of the popular Jackson. After much debate, the House of Representatives voted down all resolutions that condemned Jackson, thus implicitly endorsing the military intervention. Jackson's actions in the First Seminole War would be the subject of ongoing controversy in subsequent years, as Jackson claimed that Monroe had secretly ordered him to attack the Spanish settlements, a claim that Monroe denied. =Acquisition of Florida= Map showing the results of the Adams-Onís Treaty of 1819. Negotiations over the purchase of the Floridas began in early 1818. Don Luis de Onís, the Spanish Minister at Washington, suspended negotiations after Jackson attacked Spanish settlements, but he resumed his talks with Secretary of State Adams after the U.S. restored the territories. On February 22, 1819, Spain and the United States signed the Adams–Onís Treaty, which ceded the Floridas in return for the assumption by the United States of claims of American citizens against Spain to an amount not exceeding $5,000,000. The treaty also contained a definition of the boundary between Spanish and American possessions on the North American continent. Beginning at the mouth of the Sabine River, the line ran along that river to the 32nd parallel, then due north to the Red River, which it followed to the 100th meridian, due north to the Arkansas River, and along that river to its source, then north to the 42nd parallel, which it followed to the Pacific Ocean. The United States renounced all claims to the lands west and south of this boundary, while Spain surrendered its claim to Oregon Country. Spanish delay in relinquishing control of the Floridas led some congressmen to call for war, but Spain peacefully transferred control of the Floridas in February 1821. Latin America =Engagement= Countries in Latin America by date of independence Monroe was deeply sympathetic to the Latin American revolutionary movements against Spain. He was determined that the United States should never repeat the policies of the Washington administration during the French Revolution, when the nation had failed to demonstrate its sympathy for the aspirations of peoples seeking to establish republican governments. He did not envisage military involvement but only the provision of moral support, as he believed that a direct American intervention would provoke other European powers into assisting Spain. Despite his preferences, Monroe initially refused to recognize the Latin American governments due to ongoing negotiations with Spain over Florida. In March 1822, Monroe officially recognized the countries of Argentina, Peru, Colombia, Chile, and Mexico. Secretary of State Adams, under Monroe's supervision, wrote the instructions for the ambassadors to these new countries. They declared that the policy of the United States was to uphold republican institutions and to seek treaties of commerce on a most-favored-nation basis. The United States would support inter-American congresses dedicated to the development of economic and political institutions fundamentally different from those prevailing in Europe. Monroe took pride as the United States was the first nation to extend recognition and to set an example to the rest of the world for its support of the \\"cause of liberty and humanity\\". In 1824, the U.S. and Gran Colombia reached the Anderson–Gual Treaty, a general convention of peace, amity, navigation, and commerce that represented the first treaty the United States entered into with another country in the Americas. Between 1820 and 1830, the number of U.S. consuls assigned to foreign countries would double, with much of that growth coming in Latin America. These consuls would help merchants expand U.S. trade in the Western Hemisphere. =Monroe Doctrine= The British had a strong interest in ensuring the demise of Spanish colonialism, as the Spanish followed a mercantilist policy that imposed restrictions on trade between Spanish colonies and foreign powers. In October 1823, Ambassador Rush informed Secretary of State Adams that Foreign Secretary George Canning desired a joint declaration to deter any other power from intervening in Central and South America. Canning was motivated in part by the restoration of King Ferdinand VII of Spain by France. Britain feared that either France or the \\"Holy Alliance\\" of Austria, Prussia, and Russia would help Spain regain control of its colonies, and sought American cooperation in opposing such an intervention. Monroe and Adams deliberated the British proposal extensively, and Monroe conferred with former presidents Jefferson and Madison. Monroe was at first inclined to accept Canning's proposal, and Madison and Jefferson both shared this preference. Adams, however, vigorously opposed cooperation with Great Britain, contending that a statement of bilateral nature could limit U.S. expansion. Additionally, Adams and Monroe shared a reluctance to appear as a junior partner in any alliance. Rather than responding to Canning's alliance offer, Monroe decided to issue a statement regarding Latin America in his 1823 Annual Message to Congress. In a series of meetings with the cabinet, Monroe formulated his administration's official policy regarding European intervention in Latin America. Adams played a major role in these cabinet meetings, and the Secretary of State convinced Monroe to avoid antagonizing the members of the Holy Alliance with unduly belligerent language. Monroe's annual message was read by both houses of Congress on December 2, 1823. In it, he articulated what became known as the Monroe Doctrine. The doctrine reiterated the traditional U.S. policy of neutrality with regard to European wars and conflicts, but declared that the United States would not accept the recolonization of any country by its former European master. Monroe stated that European countries should no longer consider the Western Hemisphere open to new colonization, a jab aimed primarily at Russia, which was attempting to expand its colony on the northern Pacific Coast. At the same time, Monroe avowed non-interference with existing European colonies in the Americas. The Monroe Doctrine was well received in the United States and Britain, while Russia, French, and Austrian leaders privately denounced it. The European powers knew that the U.S. had little ability to back up the Monroe Doctrine with force, but the United States was able to \\"free ride\\" on the strength of the British Royal Navy. Nonetheless, the issuance of the Monroe Doctrine displayed a new level of assertiveness by the United States in international relations, as it represented the country's first claim to a sphere of influence. It also marked the country's shift in psychological orientation away from Europe and towards the Americas. Debates over foreign policy would no longer center on relations with Britain and France, but would instead focus on western expansion and relations with Native Americans. Russo-American Treaty In the 18th century, Russia had established Russian America on the Pacific coast. In 1821, Tsar Alexander I issued an edict declaring Russia's sovereignty over the North American Pacific coast north of the 51st parallel north. The edict also forbade foreign ships to approach within 115 miles of the Russian claim. Adams strongly protested the edict, which potentially threatened both the commerce and expansionary ambitions of the United States. Seeking favorable relations with the U.S., Alexander agreed to the Russo-American Treaty of 1824. In the treaty, Russia limited its claims to lands north of parallel 54°40′ north, and also agreed to open Russian ports to U.S. ships. States admitted to the Union Five new states were admitted to the Union while Monroe was in office: * MississippiDecember 10, 1817 * IllinoisDecember 3, 1818 * AlabamaDecember 14, 1819 * MaineMarch 15, 1820 Maine is one of 3 states set off from existing states (Kentucky and West Virginia are the others). The Massachusetts General Court passed enabling legislation on June 19, 1819 separating the \\"District of Maine\\" from the rest of the State (an action approved by the voters in Maine on July 19, 1819 by 17,001 to 7,132); then, on February 25, 1820, passed a follow-up measure officially accepting the fact of Maine's imminent statehood. * MissouriAugust 10, 1821 Elections Election of 1820 1820 electoral vote results. During James Monroe’s first term, the country had suffered an economic depression and slavery had emerged as a divisive issue. Despite these problems, the collapse of the Federalists left Monroe with no organized opposition at the end of his first term, and he ran for reelection unopposed, the only president other than George Washington to do so. A single elector from New Hampshire, William Plumer, cast a vote for John Quincy Adams, preventing a unanimous vote in the Electoral College. Plumer also refused to vote for Daniel Tompkins for Vice President, whom he considered \\"grossly intemperate.\\" His dissent was joined by several Federalist electors who, although pledged to vote for Tompkins, voted for someone else for vice president.Election of 1820 Election of 1824 1824 presidential election results. The election would be resolved in a contingent election in the House of Representatives. The Federalist Party had nearly collapsed by the end of Monroe's two terms, and all of the major presidential candidates in 1824 were members of the Democratic-Republican Party. Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, Secretary of War John C. Calhoun, Secretary of the Treasury William H. Crawford, and Speaker of the House Henry Clay each entered the race with strong followings. Crawford favored state sovereignty and strict constructionism, while Calhoun, Clay, and Adams all embraced internal improvements, high tariffs, and the national bank. As 1824 approached, General Andrew Jackson jumped into the race, motivated in large part by his anger over Clay and Crawford's denunciations of his actions in Florida.. The congressional nominating caucus had decided upon previous Democratic- Republican presidential nominees, but had become largely discredited by 1824. Candidates were instead nominated by state legislatures or nominating conventions.. With three cabinet members in the race, Monroe remained neutral. Seeing Jackson's strength, Calhoun dropped out of the presidential race and instead sought the vice presidency. The remaining candidates relied heavily on regional strength. Adams was popular in New England, Clay and Jackson were strong in the West, and Jackson and Crawford competed for the South, despite the latter's health problems. In the 1824 presidential election, Jackson won a plurality in the Electoral College, taking 99 of the 261 electoral votes, while Adams won 84, Crawford won 41, and Clay took 37. As no candidate won a majority of the electoral vote, the House was required to hold a contingent election under the terms of the Twelfth Amendment. The House would decide among the top three electoral vote winners, with each state's delegation having one vote; Clay was thus not eligible to be elected by the House.. Jackson's policy views were unclear, but Clay had been outraged by Jackson's actions in Florida, and he feared what Jackson would do in office. He also shared many policies with Adams. Adams and Clay met prior to the contingent election, and Clay agreed to support Adams.. On February 9, 1825, Adams became the second president elected by the House of Representatives (after Thomas Jefferson in 1801), when he won the contingent election on the first ballot, taking 13 of the 24 state delegations. Historical reputation Historian Harry Ammon says that as president Monroe gave up his previous partisanship, and fostered an era free of party animosity. Ammon continues: : He was a moderate nationalist, accepting the tariff and the Bank of the United States as essential to the well-being of the nation. Only on internal improvements did he adhere to the traditional strict constructionism of his party....Repudiating party loyalty as a means of executive leadership, Monroe sought to execute his policies by relying on the substantial congressional following of three members of his cabinet: John Quincy Adams (state), William H. Crawford (treasury) and John C. Calhoun (war).... [He and Adams] sought to develop a foreign policy which would not only be appropriate for a republic and realize America's national interests but also obtain from the European powers a degree of respect previously denied the United States.Harry Ammon, \\"Munro, James.\\" In John A. Garraty, Encyclopedia of American Biography (1974) pp 770-772. Ammon argues that politics undermined his second term: \\"Many of his most favored projects, such as his plans to construct stronger coastal defenses and the Anglo-American Treaty of 1823 to prohibit the international slave trade, fell victim of presidential political rivalries.Ammon, 1974, p 772 Monroe turned the nation away from European affairs and towards domestic issues. His presidency oversaw the settlement of many longstanding boundary issues through an accommodation with Britain and the acquisition of Florida. Monroe also helped resolve sectional tensions through his support of the Missouri Compromise and by seeking support from all regions of the country. Political scientist Fred Greenstein argues that Monroe was a more effective executive than some of his better-known predecessors, including Madison and John Adams. Polls of historians and political scientists tend to rank Monroe as an above average president. A 2018 poll of the American Political Science Association’s Presidents and Executive Politics section ranked Monroe as the eighteenth best president. A 2017 C-Span poll of historians ranked Monroe as the thirteenth best president.

He would have lived under Dagobert I (629–39), though his date of birth is unknown. His life is known in legend and tradition and is shown in the stained glass windows (c. 1521) and south gate of Rouen Cathedral and the stained glass windows of the église Saint-Godard (1555). The Catholic Encyclopedia claims that his legend has little historical valueActa SS., October, X, 91 sqq. with little authentic information.\\"Analecta Bollandiana\\" (1904), 337 sq He was both Lord Chancellor of France and Référendaire of France. (For Saint Romanus, Martyr, please see Romanus of Caesarea). The city's autumn \\"foire Saint-Romain\\" was set to his feast day on the \\"10th day of the Kalends of November\\" (i.e. 23 October) around 1090, at the same date as his cult was spread to the whole diocese of Rouen. Life Birth and youth His mother Félicité lamented her sterility until one night an angel appeared to Romain's father announcing that a child would be born in his house. Very young, Romanus was sent to the king's court. This was common for young aristocrats of the time - those who went were known as nourris, meaning that they effectively carried out domestic duties to the court in return for some education, before being sent back to the provinces as bishops or counts. There Romanus met saints Eligius and Audoin. When the episcopal seat of Rouen became vacant, the college of canons voted for Romanus and the king consented to their choice, offering Romain a cross.  Legendary miracles  An image from the life of St. Romanus. *Destruction of the Temple of Venus: Before becoming bishop, the faithful asked Romanus to make a temple to Venus (with an altar dedicated to her) in the Gallo-Roman amphitheatre in the north of the city disappear. Romanus went to the temple, pulled the dedication off the altar and the temple collapsed. *Destruction of the pagan temple: Romanus set out to evangelise the surrounding countryside and one day found himself faced with a pagan temple that looked like a fortress, on which demons were dancing. He cursed the demons, provoked the chief demon and the temple collapsed. *Miracle of the holy chrism: One day, Romanus was preparing to consecrate some baptismal fonts but found he had forgotten the holy chrism. The deacon he sent to look for it was in such a rush to return that he dropped and broke the vase containing the chrism, which leaked out onto the earth. Praying all the while, Romanus gathered up the pieces of the vase, which then put itself and its contents back together. *Temptation: At the end of his life, he retired to a hermitage to pray and meditate. A demon disguised as a poor woman came to ask his charity and Romanus, though he hesitated to receive a woman, did not wish to renege on his duties of hospitality. He let in the woman who undressed and untressed her hair. Romanus called on the Lord for help and an angel intervened, throwing the demon into a bottomless pit. *Floods: Flooding was frequent at this time, and Romanus intervened when it threatened to be catastrophic, making the river fall. *Ecstasy: Shortly before his death, Romanus was saying the Mass when he entered an ecstasy, his body rising off the ground as God announced the date of his death. *The dragon or Gargouille: the Gargouille (also Garguiem, as gargoyle from a word for \\"throat\\") is a dragon from the legend of Saint Romanus of Rouen. The monster does not figure in the older account of the saint's life, being recorded for the first time in 1394.Analecta Bollandiana 23 (1904), p. 337. The account described how, in the wild swamps on the left bank of the Seine a huge serpent or dragon rampaged, who \\"devoured and destroyed people and beasts of the field\\". Romanus decided to hunt in this area but could only find one man to help him, a man condemned to death who had nothing to lose. They arrived in the serpent's land and Romanus drew the sign of the cross on the beast. It then lay down at his feet and let Romanus put his stole on him as a leash, in which manner he led it into the town to be condemned to death and burned on the parvis of the cathedral (or thrown into the Seine according to other authors). This legend was the origin for the bishops' privilege (lasting until 1790) to pardon one prisoner condemned to death each year, by giving the pardoned man or woman the reliquary holding Romanus's relics in a procession.  Festival  His feast day is traditionally celebrated in the archdiocese of Rouen on 23 October, as a Triple Feast - First Class. Today they are often transferred to the following Sunday, in contravention of the date decreed for the feast by archbishop Guillaume Bonne-Ame in around 1090.  Hagiography  Four Lives of Saint Romain exist - one is a Latin verse version of the 8th century, another is a prose life addressed to the archbishop of Rouen by the doyen of Saint-Médard de Soissons. Those two lives are held in the Bibliothèque municipale de Rouen, whilst another Life is held by the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris.

Van Buren, the incumbent Vice President and chosen successor of President Andrew Jackson, took office as the eighth United States president after defeating multiple Whig Party candidates in the 1836 presidential election. A member of the Democratic Party, Van Buren's presidency ended following his defeat by Whig candidate William Henry Harrison in the 1840 presidential election. The central issue facing President Van Buren was the Panic of 1837, a sustained economic downturn that began just weeks into his presidency. Van Buren opposed any direct federal government intervention and cut back federal spending to maintain a balanced budget. He also presided over the establishment of the independent treasury system, a series of government vaults that replaced banks as the repository of federal funds. Van Buren continued the Indian removal policies of the Jackson administration, as thousands of Native Americans were resettled west of the Mississippi River during his presidency. He sought to avoid major tensions over slavery, rejecting the possibility of annexing Texas and appealing the case of United States v. The Amistad to the Supreme Court. In foreign affairs, Van Buren avoided war with Britain despite several incidents, including the bloodless Aroostook War and the Caroline Affair. Van Buren's inability to deal effectively with the economic crisis, combined with the growing political strength of the opposition Whigs, led to his defeat in the 1840 presidential election. His four-year presidency was marked as much by failure and criticism as by success and popular acclaim, and his presidency is considered average, at best, by historians. His most lasting achievement was as a political organizer who built the modern Democratic Party and guided it to dominance in the new Second Party System. Presidential election of 1836 Van Buren had emerged as President Andrew Jackson's preferred successor during the Petticoat affair, and Van Buren won election as vice president in 1832. The two men –charismatic \\"Old Hickory\\" and the super-efficient \\"Sly Fox\\"—had entirely different personalities but had become an effective team in eight years in office together.Thomas Brown, \\"From Old Hickory to Sly Fox: The Routinization of Charisma in the Early Democratic Party.\\" Journal of the Early Republic 11.3 (1991): 339-369 online. Jackson declined to seek another term in the 1836 presidential election, but he remained influential within the Democratic Party, and he strongly supported Van Buren's candidacy in the 1836 election. With Jackson's support, Van Buren won the presidential nomination of the 1835 Democratic National Convention without opposition. Two names were put forward for the vice-presidential nomination: Representative Richard M. Johnson of Kentucky, and former senator William Cabell Rives of Virginia. Though most Southern Democrats favored Rives, Jackson preferred Johnson, and his influence helped lead to Johnson's nomination for the vice presidency. 1836 electoral vote results The newly-established Whig Party, a loose coalition bound by mutual opposition to Jackson, sought to prevent Van Buren's victory in the election of 1836. Lacking the party unity or organizational strength to field a single ticket or define a single platform, the Whigs fielded multiple candidates in the hope of forcing a contingent election in the House of Representatives. Senator Hugh Lawson White of Tennessee, a former Jackson ally, emerged as the major Whig candidate in the South, touting himself as the only Southerner in the race. William Henry Harrison, who had gained notoriety for his service in the Battle of Tippecanoe, edged out Senator Daniel Webster to become the main Whig candidate in the North. The Whig Party campaigned on the themes of Jackson's alleged executive tyranny, and attacked Van Buren as an untrustworthy career politician. Van Buren had to articulate a position on slavery that could win full-throated approval in both the pro-slavery South and the Northern states where slavery was illegal and unpopular. The biggest challenge came in the South, were all Yankees were automatically suspect on the slave question.Joseph Hobson Harrison, \\"Martin Van Buren and His Southern Supporters.\\" Journal of Southern History 22#4 (1956): 438-458 online. Van Buren moved to obtain the support of Southerners by assuring them that he opposed abolitionism and supported the continued existence of slavery in states where it was present. Van Buren did not discuss his own personal beliefs, which held that slavery was immoral, but was sanctioned by the Constitution. Van Buren's strategy was not to defend his personal position, but to attack abolitionists, who were popular nowhere in the United States. As vice president, he cast the tie-breaking Senate vote in favor of a bill to subject abolitionist mail to state laws, thus ensuring that abolitionist mail would not be circulated in the South. While Southern Whigs cast doubt on his devotion to slavery, his supporters insisted he believed in three things: that Congress could not interfere with slavery in the states, that it would be \\"impolitic\\" to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, and that agitation about slavery endangered the union. Van Buren and his supporters realized that to build a viable national party and to maintain the union they had to compromise by accepting slavery. The Democrats created the first modern party, but in doing so consciously removed slavery and abolition from the partisan agenda. In 1848, Van Buren became a leading opponent of the extension of slavery in the North, but by then he had abandoned any hope of Southern support.William G. Shade, \\"'The Most Delicate and Exciting Topics': Martin Van Buren, Slavery, and the Election of 1836.\\" Journal of the Early Republic 18.3 (1998): 459-484 online. Van Buren won the election with 764,198 popular votes, 50.9 percent of the total, and 170 electoral votes. Harrison led the Whigs with 73 electoral votes, White receiving 26, and Webster 14. Willie Person Mangum received South Carolina's 11 electoral votes, which were awarded by the state legislature. Compared to Jackson's 1832 campaign, Van Buren performed better in New England but worse in the South and West. Van Buren's victory resulted from a combination of his own attractive political and personal qualities, Jackson's popularity and endorsement, the organizational power of the Democratic party, and the inability of the Whig Party to muster an effective candidate and campaign. Virginia's presidential electors voted for Van Buren for president but William Smith for vice president, leaving Johnson one electoral vote short of election. In accordance with the Twelfth Amendment, the Senate elected Johnson vice president in a contingent vote. Meanwhile, in the concurrent congressional elections, Democrats retained control of both houses of Congress. The election of 1836 marked an important turning point in American political history because of the part it played in establishing the Second Party System. In the early 1830s the political party structure was still changing rapidly, and factional and personal leaders continued to play a major role in politics. By the end of the campaign of 1836, the new party system was almost fully formed, as nearly every faction had been absorbed by either the Democrats or the Whigs.Joel H. Silbey, \\"Election of 1836.\\" in Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., ed. History of American Presidential Elections (1968) 2:577-600. Inauguration Portrait of Martin Van Buren Van Buren was sworn in as president by Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Taney on March 4, 1837, in a ceremony held on the East Portico of the United States Capitol. At age 54, he was the youngest person at the time to assume the presidency. Taking the oath as the eighth president, Van Buren defined his role as one of preservation: \\"sacredly to uphold those political institutions\\" created by the Founders and especially to safeguard the hallowed Jeffersonian principles of a limited national government and the liberty and sovereignty of \\"the people and the states.\\" The inauguration marked the departure of a vital personality–Jackson–and the arrival of his chosen successor–Van Buren–in a new presidential dynasty. They rode together in a small phaeton (built from the wood of USS Constitution) drawn by four gray horses. This was the first time that the outgoing president and incoming president rode together to the Capitol. The days festivities proved less a celebration of the incoming president than a tribute to the outgoing one. Van Buren's inaugural address took wistful note of it: Administration Cabinet Van Buren retained much of Jackson's cabinet and lower-level appointees, as he hoped that the retention of Jackson's appointees would halt Whig momentum in the South and restore confidence in the Democrats as a party of sectional unity. The cabinet holdovers represented the different regions of the country: Secretary of the Treasury Levi Woodbury came from New England, Attorney General Benjamin F. Butler and Secretary of the Navy Mahlon Dickerson hailed from the mid-Atlantic states, Secretary of State John Forsyth represented the South, and Postmaster General Amos Kendall of Kentucky represented the West. For the position of Secretary of War, the lone unfilled post in the cabinet, Van Buren first approached William Cabell Rives, who had sought the vice presidency in 1836. After Rives declined to join the cabinet, Van Buren appointed Joel Roberts Poinsett, a South Carolinian who had opposed secession during the Nullification Crisis. Van Buren's cabinet choices were criticized by Pennsylvanians such as James Buchanan, who argued that their state deserved a cabinet position, as well as some Democrats who argued that Van Buren should have used his patronage powers to augment his own power. But Van Buren saw value in avoiding contentious patronage battles, and his decision to retain Jackson's cabinet made it clear that he intended to continue the policies of predecessor. Additionally, Van Buren had helped select Jackson's cabinet appointees and enjoyed strong working relationships with them. Dissatisfied with the discipline and morale of the navy, Van Buren pressured Dickerson to resign in 1838, and Dickerson was succeeded by James K. Paulding. That same year, Butler resigned and was replaced with Felix Grundy, a Senator from Tennessee with close ties to Jackson. Grundy was later succeeded by Henry D. Gilpin of Pennsylvania. John M. Niles, a party loyalist and former Senator from Connecticut, became Postmaster General in 1840. Van Buren was closely involved in foreign affairs and matters pertaining to the Treasury Department, but the Post Office, War Department, and Navy Department all possessed high levels of autonomy under their respective cabinet secretaries. Van Buren held regular formal cabinet meetings and discontinued the informal gatherings of advisers that had attracted so much attention during Jackson's presidency. Van Buren saw himself as \\"a mediator, and to some extent an umpire between the conflicting opinions\\" of his counselors. He solicited advice from department heads, tolerating open and even frank exchanges between cabinet members. The president's detachment allowed him to reserve judgment and protect his own prerogative for making final decisions. White House hostess Angelica Singleton For the first half of his presidency, Van Buren, who had been a widower since the death of his wife, Hannah Van Buren in 1819, did not have a specific person fill the role of White House hostess, instead assuming such duties himself. When his eldest son Abraham Van Buren married Angelica Singleton in 1838, the president quickly acted to install his daughter-in-law as his hostess. She solicited the advice of her distant relative, Dolley Madison, who had moved back to Washington after her husband's death, and soon the president's parties livened up. After the 1839 New Year's Eve reception, the Boston Post raved: \\"[Angelica Van Buren is a] lady of rare accomplishments, very modest yet perfectly easy and graceful in her manners and free and vivacious in her conversation ... universally admired.\\" As the nation endured a deep economic depression, newspaper coverage of Angelica Van Buren's receiving style at receptions, influenced by her heavy reading on European court life, as well as the anecdotal claim that she intended to re-landscape the White House grounds to resemble the royal gardens of Europe, were used to attack her father-in-law. Pennsylvania Whig Congressman Charles Ogle referred obliquely to her as part of the presidential \\"household\\" in his famous \\"Gold Spoon Oration.\\" Judicial appointments Van Buren appointed two associate justices of the Supreme Court. Congress had added two new seats on the Supreme Court with the Eighth and Ninth Circuits Act of 1837, but President Jackson had filled only one of those positions. To fill the vacancy, in early 1837 Van Buren appointed Senator John McKinley of Alabama, a key supporter of Van Buren's 1836 presidential campaign. A second Supreme Court vacancy arose in 1841 due to the death of Philip Pendleton Barbour. Van Buren appointed federal judge Peter Vivian Daniel to succeed Barbour. Van Buren also appointed eight other federal judges, all to United States district courts. Domestic affairs Panic of 1837 and treasury system =Panic of 1837= The modern balaam and his ass, an 1837 caricature placing the blame for the Panic of 1837 and the perilous state of the banking system on outgoing President Andrew Jackson, shown riding a donkey, while President Martin Van Buren comments approvingly. On May 10, 1837, some important state banks in New York, running out of hard currency reserves, suddenly refused to convert paper money into gold or silver. Other financial institutions throughout the nation quickly followed suit, marking the start of a financial crisis that would become known as the Panic of 1837. The panic was followed by a five-year depression in which numerous banks failed and unemployment reached record highs.W. J. Rorabaugh, Donald T. Critchlow, Paula C. Baker (2004). \\"America's promise: a concise history of the United States\\". Rowman & Littlefield. p.210. Van Buren blamed the economic collapse on greedy business and financial institutions, as well as on the over extension of credit by U.S. banks. Whig leaders in Congress, meanwhile, blamed Democratic economic policies, especially the 1836 Specie Circular. That policy had required the use of specie (coins), rather than paper money, in the purchase of government-held lands, and had had the effect of transferring specie from Eastern banks to Western banks and undermining confidence in banknotes. Whigs also blamed Jackson's dismantling of the Second Bank of the United States, thereby allowing state banks to engage in lending and the printing of paper money without effective regulation. Another contributing factor to the panic was the sudden contraction of English credit, which had helped to finance a period of strong economic growth since 1830. =Independent Treasury= While Whig leader Henry Clay promoted his own American System as the best means for economic recovery, Van Buren's response to the panic focused on the practice of \\"strict economy and frugality.\\" The potential repeal of the Specie Circular policy split the Democratic Party, with prominent Democrats like William Cabell Rives and Nathaniel Tallmadge urging it as part of a move away from Jackson's hard currency policies. After a long period of consideration, Van Buren announced in May 1837 that he would not revoke the Specie Circular. Van Buren feared that revoking the Specie Circular would hurt western banks, and was reluctant to depart from a Jacksonian policy so quickly after taking office. Van Buren's decision to uphold the Specie Circular represented the first step in his commitment to the separation of the government from all banking operations, a policy that would become the central economic policy of his tenure. During Jackson's presidency, the federal government had moved its funds from the Second Bank of the United States to so-called \\"pet banks.\\" Both the Second Bank of the United States and the pet banks had used those federal deposits to engage in regular banking activities, specifically the extension of loans. Van Buren sought to fully divorce the federal government from banking operations by establishing the Independent Treasury system, essentially a series of vaults, to hold government funds. The Independent Treasury took its name from its supposed independence from banks and British creditors, as British creditors had made large investments in the Second Bank of the United States. The Independent Treasury was inspired by the writings of William M. Gouge, a hard currency advocate who argued that any federal collaboration with banks both risked corruption and reinforced a speculative boom and bust cycle that led to economic downturns. When the 25th Congress convened in September 1837, Van Buren introduced his legislation to create the Independent Treasury system. Van Buren's plan allowed the government to accept paper money as payment, but the government would seek to convert that paper money to specie as quickly as possible. State banking interests strongly opposed Van Buren's proposal, and an alliance of conservative Democrats and Whigs blocked the creation of the Independent Treasury System. As the debate over the Independent Treasury continued, Rives and some other Democrats defected to the Whig Party, which itself grew more unified in its opposition to Van Buren. The Panic of 1837 loomed large over the 1837 and 1838 election cycles, as the carryover effects of the economic downturn led to Whig gains in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The Democratic Party retained a majority in both chambers after the elections, but a split among House Democrats led to the election of Whig Congressman Robert M. T. Hunter as Speaker of the House. Meanwhile, Whigs won gains in state elections across the country, including in Van Buren's home state of New York. In early 1838, most banks ended their moratorium on converting paper into money into gold or silver, temporarily bringing an end to the monetary crisis. The economy began to recover, and an alliance of Democrats and Whigs repealed the Specie Circular that year. A second economic downturn, known as the Panic of 1839, began as the result of a cotton glut. With less income coming in from the cotton trade, land prices plummeted, industries laid off employees, and banks failed. According to historian Daniel Walker Howe, the economic crisis of the late 1830s and early 1840s was the most severe recession in U.S. history until the Great Depression. Partly in response to this second economic downturn, Congress enacted Van Buren's Independent Treasury proposal in June 1840. The Whigs would abolish the Independent Treasury system in 1841, but it was revived in 1846 and remained in place until the passage of the Federal Reserve Act in 1913. Indian removal Federal policy under Jackson had sought, through the Indian Removal Act of 1830, to move all indigenous peoples to lands west of the Mississippi River. Continuing this policy, the federal government negotiated 19 treaties with Indian nations in the course of Van Buren's presidency. By the time Van Buren took office, the Muscogee, Chickasaw, and Choctaw had been removed to lands west of the Mississippi River, but a large number of Cherokee were still in Georgia and the Seminole remained in Florida. An 1835 treaty signed by U.S. government officials and representatives of the Cherokee Nation had established terms under which the entire nation would cede its territory and move across the Mississippi River, but many Cherokee viewed the treaty as fraudulent. In 1838, Van Buren directed General Winfield Scott to forcibly move all those Cherokee who had not yet complied with the treaty. The Cherokee were herded violently into internment camps, where they were kept for the summer of 1838. The actual transportation west was delayed by intense heat and drought, but in the fall, the Cherokee reluctantly agreed to migrate west. During the Cherokee removal, part of the Trail of Tears, some 20,000 people were relocated against their will. U.S. Marine boat expedition searching the Everglades during the Second Seminole War In the Florida Territory, the Seminole engaged the army in a prolonged conflict known as the Second Seminole War. The Seminole were more resistant to removal than other tribes of the South due in large part to the influence of hundreds of escaped slaves and other African Americans who lived among the Seminole. These escaped slaves feared that the departure of the Seminole would lead to their own re- enslavement. Prior to leaving office, Jackson had placed General Thomas Jesup in command of all U.S. troops in Florida in order to force Seminole emigration to the West. Forts were established throughout the Indian territory and columns of soldiers scoured the countryside. Feeling the pressure, many Seminoles, including head chief Micanopy, offered to surrender. The Seminoles slowly gathered for emigration near Tampa, but in June they fled the detention camps, driven off by disease and the presence of slave catchers who were hoping to take Black Seminoles captive. In December 1837, Jesup began a massive offensive, culminating in the Battle of Lake Okeechobee. Following the American victory in the battle, the war entered a new phase, a long war of attrition. During this time, the government realized that it would be almost impossible to drive the remaining Seminoles from Florida, so Van Buren sent General Alexander Macomb to negotiate a peace with the Seminoles. It was the only time in U.S. history that a Native American nation had forced the United States to sue for peace. An agreement was reached allowing the Seminoles to remain in southwest Florida, but the peace was shattered in July 1839. Fighting was not resolved until 1842, after Van Buren had left office. The United States spent over $30 million in the Second Seminole War, which also cost the lives of over 1400 American military personnel, dozens of civilians, and at least seven hundred Seminole. Historian Laurence M. Hauptman argues that dishonest and underhanded methods were deliberately employed to remove the Iroquois and Stockbridge-Munsee Indians from their lands in upstate New York without payment. He states that federal officials, James W. Stryker, John F. Schermerhorn, and Random H. Gillet, collaborated with Van Buren in fraudulently imposing the 1838 Treaty of Buffalo Creek using bribery, forgery, corruption, and deception.Laurence M. Hauptman, \\"Four Eastern New Yorkers and Seneca Lands: A Study in Treaty-Making.\\" Hudson Valley Regional Review (1996) \`13#1 pp 1-19.Laurence M. Hauptman, The Tonawanda Senecas' Heroic Battle Against Removal: Conservative Activist Indians (SUNY Press, 2011) excerpt. Meanwhile in Michigan, the Ottawas managed to remain in their ancestral home land by threatening to join the British in neighboring Canada, and by becoming landowners who had a higher status and were important factors in the local economy. They also deliberately sent thei young men into the local wage labor market to make their presence valuable to the white community. They never threatened the local whites and had significant support from the community.James M. McClurken, \\"Ottawa Adaptive Strategies to Indian Removal.\\" Michigan Historical Review (1986) 12#1: 29-55. online  Slavery  =Slavery policy= The abolitionist movement had gained in popularity during the 1830s, and the activism of abolitionist groups like the American Anti-Slavery Society prompted denunciations from Southern leaders like John C. Calhoun. Van Buren viewed abolitionism as the greatest threat to the nation's unity. He opposed any attempt on the part of Congress to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia against the wishes of the slave-holding states, and to resist the slightest interference with it in the states where it existed. Reflecting the increasing importance of slavery as a topic of national debate, Van Buren was the first president to make use of the word \\"slavery\\" in an inaugural address, and his stances led to accusations that he was a \\"northern man with southern feelings.\\" However, Van Buren was also sensitive to northern concerns about the expansion of slavery, and he opposed the annexation of Texas out of a desire to avoid sectional disputes. During Van Buren's presidency, congressional leaders sought to avoid divisive debates over slavery through the \\"gag rule,\\" an informal practice in which any discussion of the abolition of slavery in Congress was immediately tabled. While the gag rule was largely successful in stifling the debate over slavery in the Senate, Congressman (and former President) John Quincy Adams earned notoriety for his efforts to resist the gag rule in the House of Representatives. Adams defeated an attempt at censuring him, but a coalition of Southerners and Northern Democrats ensured that the gag rule remained in place. As the debate over slavery continued to gain prominence, a small group of anti-slavery activists founded the Liberty Party, which would nominate James G. Birney for president in the 1840 election. =Amistad case= Like the British and Americans, the Spanish had outlawed the importation of slaves from Africa, but high slave mortality rates encouraged smugglers to smuggle captured slaves from Africa into Spanish colony of Cuba. In June 1839, several recently-kidnapped Africans took control of La Amistad, a slave ship headed to Cuba. The Africans attempted to sail home, but were tricked by one of the crew members into heading towards the United States, where the Africans were apprehended and brought before the federal court of Judge Andrew T. Judson. The Spanish government demanded that the ship and its cargo (including the Africans) be turned over to them. The Van Buren administration, hoping to minimize the political domestic and international fallout from the incident, supported Spain's position at trial. Defying the expectations of most observers, Judson ruled that the defendants be set free. After the federal circuit upheld Judson's ruling, the Van Buren administration appealed the case to the Supreme Court. In March 1841, the Supreme Court upheld Judson's ruling, holding that the Africans had been kidnapped illegally. After the case, the abolitionists raised money to pay for the return of the Africans, and they departed from the United States in November 1841. The unique nature of the Amistad case, involving international issues and parties, people of color testifying in federal court, and the participation of former president Adams and other high- profile lawyers, engendered great public interest. The Amistad case drew attention to the personal tragedies of slavery and attracted new support for the growing abolition movement in the North. It also transformed the courts into the principal forum for a national debate on the legal foundations of slavery. Mormons In 1839, Joseph Smith, Jr., the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, visited Van Buren to plead for the U.S. to help the roughly 20,000 Mormon settlers of Independence, Missouri, who had been forced from the state during the 1838 Mormon War. The Governor of Missouri, Lilburn Boggs, had issued an executive order on October 27, 1838, known as the \\"Extermination Order\\". It authorized troops to use force against Mormons to \\"exterminate or drive [them] from the state\\".Boggs, Extermination Order In 1839, after moving to Illinois, Smith and his party appealed to members of Congress and to President Van Buren to intercede for the Mormons. According to Smith's grandnephew, Van Buren said to Smith, \\"Your cause is just, but I can do nothing for you; if I take up for you I shall lose the vote of Missouri\\". Foreign affairs Texas The Republic of Texas had gained de facto independence from Mexico in the Texas Revolution, and Texans had subsequently voted overwhelmingly in favor of annexation by the United States. Just before leaving office in March 1837, Andrew Jackson had extended diplomatic recognition to the Republic of Texas, and the possibility of annexation heightened sectional tensions at home while also presenting the possibility of war with Mexico. New England abolitionists charged that there was a \\"slaveholding conspiracy to acquire Texas\\", and Daniel Webster eloquently denounced annexation. Many Southern leaders, meanwhile, strongly desired the expansion of slave-holding territory in the United States. Boldly reversing Jackson's policies, Van Buren sought peace abroad and harmony at home. He proposed a diplomatic solution to a long-standing financial dispute between American citizens and the Mexican government, rejecting Jackson's threat to settle it by force. Likewise, when the Texas minister at Washington, D.C., proposed annexation to the administration in August 1837, he was told that the proposition could not be entertained. Constitutional scruples and fear of war with Mexico were the reasons given for the rejection, but concern that it would precipitate a clash over the extension of slavery undoubtedly influenced Van Buren and continued to be the chief obstacle to annexation. Northern and Southern Democrats followed an unspoken rule in which Northerners helped quash anti-slavery proposals and Southerners refrained from agitating for the annexation of Texas. Texas withdrew the annexation offer in 1838. Relations with Britain =Canadian rebellions= British subjects in Lower Canada and Upper Canada rose in rebellion in 1837 and 1838, protesting their lack of responsible government. While the initial insurrection in Upper Canada ended with the December 1837 Battle of Montgomery's Tavern, many of the rebels fled across the Niagara River into New York, and Canadian leader William Lyon Mackenzie began recruiting volunteers in Buffalo. Mackenzie declared the establishment of the Republic of Canada and put into motion a plan whereby volunteers would invade Upper Canada from Navy Island on the Canadian side of the Niagara River. Several hundred volunteers traveled to Navy Island in the weeks that followed, procuring the steamboat Caroline to deliver supplies to Navy Island. Seeking to deter an imminent invasion, British forces crossed to the American bank of the river in late December 1837, and they burned and sank the Caroline. In the melee, one American was killed and others were wounded. Considerable sentiment arose within the United States to declare war, and a British ship was burned in revenge. \\"Destruction of the Caroline\\", illustration by John Charles Dent (1881) Van Buren, looking to avoid a war with Great Britain, sent General Winfield Scott to the border with large discretionary powers for its protection and its peace. Scott impressed upon American citizens the need for a peaceful resolution to the crisis, and made it clear that the U.S. government would not support adventuresome Americans attacking the British. In early January 1838, the president proclaimed U.S. neutrality with regard to the Canadian independence issue, a declaration which Congress endorsed by passing a neutrality law designed to discourage the participation of American citizens in foreign conflicts. Though Scott was able to calm the situation, a group of secret societies known as \\"Hunters' Lodges\\" continued to seek the overthrow of British rule in Canada. These groups carried out several attacks in Upper Canada, collectively known as the Patriot War. The administration followed through on its enforcement of the Neutrality Act, encouraged the prosecution of filibusters, and actively deterred U.S. citizens from subversive activities abroad. After the failure of two filibuster expeditions in late 1839, the Hunters' Lodges lost their popular appeal and the Patriot War came to an end. In the long term, Van Buren's opposition to the Patriot War contributed to the construction of healthy Anglo–American and U.S.–Canadian relations in the 20th century; it also led, more immediately, to a backlash among citizens regarding the supposed overreach of federal authority. =Aroostook conflict= A new crisis between Britain and the United States surfaced in late 1838 in disputed territory on the Maine–New Brunswick frontier. Jackson had been willing to drop American claims to the region in return for other concessions, but Maine was unwilling to drop its claims to the disputed territory. For their part, the British considered possession of the area vital to the defense of Canada. Both American and New Brunswick lumberjacks cut timber in the disputed territory during the winter of 1838–39. On December 29, New Brunswick lumbermen were spotted cutting down trees on an American estate near the Aroostook River. After American woodcutters rushed to stand guard, a shouting match, known as the Battle of Caribou, ensued. Tensions quickly boiled over into a near war with both Maine and New Brunswick arresting each other's citizens, and the crisis seemed ready to turn into an armed conflict. British troops began to gather along the Saint John River. Governor John Fairfield mobilized the state militia to confront the British in the disputed territory and several forts were constructed. The American press clamored for war; \\"Maine and her soil, or BLOOD!\\" screamed one editorial. \\"Let the sword be drawn and the scabbard thrown away!\\" In June, Congress authorized 50,000 troops and a $10 million budget in the event foreign military troops crossed into United States territory. Van Buren was unwilling to go to war over the disputed territory, though he assured Maine that he would respond to any attacks by the British. To settle the crisis, Van Buren met with the British minister to the United States, and Van Buren and the minister agreed to resolve the border issue diplomatically. Van Buren also sent General Scott to the northern border area, both to show military resolve, and more importantly, to lower the tensions. Scott successfully convinced all sides to submit the border issue to arbitration. The border dispute was put to rest a few years later, with the signing of the 1842 Webster–Ashburton Treaty. Presidential election of 1840 1840 electoral vote results Van Buren paid close attention to party organization, and support for the communication media such as newspapers and magazines. They receive subsidies in the form of government printing contracts. At an intellectual level, his administration was strongly supported by the monthly The United States Magazine and Democratic Review, based in Washington and edited by John L. O'Sullivan. IIts editorials and articles provided the arguments that partisan needed to discuss Democratic Party positions on the Mexican War, slavery, states' rights, and Indian removal.Robert J, Scholnick, \\"Extermination and Democracy: O'Sullivan, the Democratic Review, and Empire, 1837—1840.\\" American Periodicals (2005) 15#2: 123-141.online Though he faced no serious opposition for the presidential nomination at the 1840 Democratic National Convention, Van Buren and his party faced a difficult election in 1840. Van Buren's term had been a difficult affair, with the U.S. economy mired in a severe downturn, and other divisive issues, such as slavery, western expansion, and tensions with Great Britain provided numerous for opportunities for Van Buren's political opponents to criticize his actions. Although Van Buren's renomination was never in doubt, Democratic strategists began to question the wisdom of keeping Johnson on the ticket. Even former president Jackson conceded that Johnson was a liability and insisted on former House Speaker James K. Polk of Tennessee as Van Buren's new running mate. Van Buren was reluctant to drop Johnson, who was popular with workers and radicals in the North and added military experience to the ticket, which might prove important if the Whigs nominated William Henry Harrison. Rather than re-nominating Johnson, the Democratic convention decided to allow state Democratic Party leaders to select the vice-presidential candidates for their states. The convention drafted the first party platform in U.S. history, fully endorsing Van Buren's views on economic policy and other matters. Van Buren hoped that the Whigs would nominate Henry Clay for president, which would allow Van Buren to cast the 1840 campaign as a clash between Van Buren's Independent Treasury system and Clay's support for a revived national bank. Clay had the backing of most Southerners at the 1839 Whig National Convention, but most Northerners favored Harrison. Northern leaders like William Seward and Thaddeus Stevens believed that Harrison's war record would effectively counter the popular appeals of the Democratic Party. General Winfield Scott also had some support, and he loomed as a potential compromise candidate between Clay and Harrison. Due in large part to effective maneuvering by Weed and Thaddeus Stevens, Harrison triumphed over Clay on the third ballot of the convention. For vice president, the Whigs nominated former Senator John Tyler of Virginia. Clay was deeply disappointed by his defeat at the convention, but he nonetheless threw his support behind Harrison. Whigs presented Harrison as the antithesis of the president, whom they derided as ineffective, corrupt, and effete. Whigs contrasted their image of Van Buren as an aristocrat living in high style with images of Harrison as a simple man of the people who sipped cider in a log cabin. Issues of policy were not absent from the campaign; the Whigs derided the alleged executive overreaches of Jackson and Van Buren, while also calling for the re-establishment of the national bank and higher tariffs. Democrats attempted to campaign on the Independent Treasury system, but the onset of deflation undercut these arguments. Many Northerners attacked Van Buren for his support of the gag rule, while in the South, many Whigs claimed that the Virginia-born Harrison would presented less of a threat to the institution of slavery than did Van Buren. The enthusiasm for \\"Tippecanoe and Tyler Too,\\" coupled with the country's severe economic crisis, propelled Harrison to victory. Ultimately, Harrison won 53 percent of the popular vote, and defeated Van Buren in the electoral vote by a margin of 234 to 60. Voter turnout rose from about 55 percent in 1836 to approximately 80 percent in 1840, which represented the highest turnout in a presidential election up to that point in U.S. history. Van Buren won more votes in 1840 than he had in 1836, but the Whig success in attracting new voters more than canceled out Democratic gains. The Whigs also won control of the House and Senate, making the 1840 election the only time in U.S. history that the Whigs won unified control of Congress and the presidency. Historical reputation Martin Van Buren on the 8-cent U.S. Postage stamp of the 1938 Presidential Series According to historian Robert Remini:Robert Remini, \\"Van Buren, Martin\\" in John A. Garraty, ed., Encyclopedia of American Biography (1974) pp 1120-1122. :Van Buren's creative contribution to the political development of the nation was enormous, and as such he earned his way to the presidency. After gaining control of New York's Republican Party he organized the Albany Regency to run the state in his absence while he pursued a national career in Washington. The Regency was a governing consul in Albany consisting of a group of politically astute and highly intelligent men. He was one of the first statewide political machines in the country was success resulted from its professional use of patronage, the legislative caucus, and the official party newspaper.....[In Washington] he labored to bring about the reorganization of the Republican Party through an alliance between what he called \\"the planters of the South and the plain Republicans of the North.\\"... Heretofore parties were regarded as evils to be tolerated; Van Buren argued that the party system was the most sensible and intelligent way the affairs of the nation could be democratically conducted, a viewpoint that eventually won national approval. Van Buren's presidency is considered average, at best, by historians. His time in office was dominated by the economic disaster of the Panic of 1837, and historians have split on the adequacy of the Independent Treasury as a response to that issue. Van Buren's most lasting achievement was as a political organizer who built the Democratic Party and guided it to dominance in the Second Party System, and historians have come to regard Van Buren as integral to the development of the American political system. A 2017 C-SPAN survey has Martin Van Buren ranked among the bottom third of presidents of all-time, right below George W. Bush and above Chester A. Arthur. The survey asked 91 presidential historians to rank the 43 former presidents (including then-out-going president Barack Obama) in various categories to come up with a composite score, resulting in an overall ranking. Van Buren was ranked 34th among all former presidents (down from 31st in 2009, and 30th in 2000). His rankings in the various categories of this most recent poll were as follows: public persuasion (30), crisis leadership (35), economic management (40), moral authority (33), international relations (26), administrative skills (26), relations with congress (28), vision/setting an agenda (33), pursued equal justice for all (30), performance with context of times (33). A 2018 poll of the American Political Science Association's Presidents and Executive Politics section ranked Van Buren as the 27th best president. Several writers have portrayed Van Buren as among the nation's most obscure presidents.

Early years and background When Goody was aged eight years, together with his parents he migrated to Australia from England due to his father starting to feel the effects of creeping spinal paralysis. The family arrived in Perth and were met by representatives of Archbishop Patrick Clune, having converted from Anglicanism to Catholicism some years yearlier.

He had been Vice President of the United States for only days when he assumed the presidency. The tenth United States president, he was the first to succeed to the office intra-term without being elected to it. To forestall constitutional uncertainty, Tyler took the presidential oath of office on April 6, moved into the White House, and assumed full presidential powers, a precedent that would govern future extraordinary successions and eventually become codified in the Twenty-fifth Amendment. Although nominated for the vice presidency on the Whig Party ticket, Tyler differed from his party on several issues. A strict constructionist, Tyler found much of the Whig platform unconstitutional, and he vetoed several bills favored by party leader Henry Clay. Among the bills vetoed by Tyler was a measure to re-establish a national bank. In response to these vetoes, most of Tyler's cabinet resigned, and Whig congressmen expelled Tyler from the party. A resolution calling for his impeachment was introduced in the House, though it was later defeated. Despite his disagreements with Congress, Tyler did sign the Tariff of 1842, which provided needed revenue to a government still dealing with the effects of the Panic of 1837. Tyler had more success in international affairs. His administration reached the Webster–Ashburton Treaty, which settled a contentious territorial with Great Britain. Tyler also emphasized American interests in the Pacific Ocean, and he reached a commercial treaty with Qing China. He also extended the principles of the Monroe Doctrine to Hawaii. During his last two years in office Tyler pressed for the annexation of Texas as a slave state, injecting the annexation issue into the 1844 presidential election. Partly due to that issue, the 1844 election was won by Democrat James K. Polk. On March 1, 1845, three days before turning the presidency over to Polk, Tyler signed a Texas annexation bill into law, and Texas would be admitted as a state in the first year of Polk's presidency. Tyler's presidency has provoked highly divided responses, but he is generally held in low esteem by historians. Edward P. Crapol began his biography John Tyler, the Accidental President (2006) by noting: \\"Other biographers and historians have argued that John Tyler was a hapless and inept chief executive whose presidency was seriously flawed.\\"Crapol, pp. 2–3. In The Republican Vision of John Tyler (2003), Dan Monroe observed that the Tyler presidency \\"is generally ranked as one of the least successful\\".Monroe, p. 3. Some historians and commentators have praised Tyler's foreign policy, personal conduct, and the precedent he set with regards to presidential succession. Accession In the 1840 presidential election, the Whig ticket of William Henry Harrison and John Tyler defeated the Democratic ticket led by incumbent President Martin Van Buren. Tyler was sworn in as the nation's 10th vice president on March 4, 1841, the same day as President Harrison's inauguration. Following Harrison's two-hour speech on a cold and overcast March 4, the vice president returned to the Senate to receive the president's cabinet nominations, presiding over the confirmations the following day—a total of two hours as President of the Senate. Expecting few responsibilities, he then left Washington, quietly returning to his home in Williamsburg.Chitwood, pp. 200–02.Seager, pp. 144–45. After his inauguration, Harrison called for a special session of Congress, to begin in late May, in order to address the dangerous financial condition of a country still in the midst of the Panic of 1837.Peterson, pp. 38–39. The first few weeks of the presidency took a toll on Harrison's health, and after being caught in a rainstorm in late March he came down with pneumonia and pleurisy. Harrison's old age and fading health were no secret during the campaign, and the question of the presidential succession was on every politician's mind.Chitwood, pp. 201–02.Seager, pp. 142–47. Harrison's death from Chief Clerk of the State Department Fletcher Webster Secretary of State Daniel Webster sent word to Tyler of Harrison's illness on April 1,Crapol, p. 8. and on April 5, Tyler learned that Harrison had died on the preceding day. Harrison's death while in office was an unprecedented event that caused considerable uncertainty regarding presidential succession. Legal scholars had long anticipated that a president would die in office at some point, but no firm consensus existed as to whether or not the vice president would fully assume the office of the presidency.Peterson, pp. 47–48. Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 of the United States Constitution, which governed intra-term presidential succession at the timeThis constitutional provision was later superseded by the Twenty-fifth Amendment states that: The text of this Constitutional prescription led to the question of whether the actual office of president, or merely the president's powers and duties, devolved upon Vice President Tyler. The cabinet met within an hour of Harrison's death and, according to a later account, determined that Tyler would be \\"vice- president acting President\\".Dinnerstein, p. 447. For his part, Tyler firmly asserted that the Constitution gave him full and unqualified powers of office and had himself sworn in immediately as president, setting an important precedent for an orderly transfer of power following a president's death. The presidential oath was administered by Chief Judge William Cranch of the U.S. Circuit Court of the District of Columbia in Tyler's hotel room. Tyler had initially questioned the necessity of taking the oath, arguing that it was redundant to his oath as vice president, but agreed to it in order to quell any doubt over his accession.Chitwood, pp. 202–03. Tyler delivered an inaugural address before Congress on April 9, in which he reasserted his belief in fundamental tenets of Jeffersonian democracy and limited federal power. Tyler's claim to be president was resisted by many members of Congress. Representative (and former president) John Quincy Adams felt that Tyler should be a caretaker under the title of \\"acting president\\", or remain vice president in name.Chitwood, pp. 203–07. Also among those who questioned Tyler's authority was Senator Henry Clay, who had planned to be \\"the real power behind a fumbling throne\\" while Harrison was alive, and intended the same for Tyler. Clay saw Tyler as the \\"vice-president\\" and his presidency as a mere \\"regency\\".Seager, pp. 142, 151. After some heated debate, Congress confirmed Tyler's interpretation that he was, indeed, the new president. In both houses, unsuccessful amendments were offered to strike the word \\"president\\" in favor of language including the term \\"vice president\\" to refer to Tyler. Mississippi Senator Robert J. Walker, in opposition, stated that the idea that Tyler was still vice president and could preside over the Senate was absurd.Dinnerstein, pp. 451–53. Tyler never wavered from his conviction that he was the rightful president; when his political opponents sent correspondence to the White House addressed to the \\"vice president\\" or \\"acting president\\", Tyler had it returned unopened.Crapol, p. 10. Administration Fearing that he would alienate Harrison's supporters, Tyler decided to keep the dead president's entire cabinet even though several members were openly hostile to him and resented his assumption of the office. At his first cabinet meeting, Tyler was informed that Harrison had let major policy decisions be resolved by a majority vote, and that the cabinet expected the new president to continue this practice. Tyler was astounded and immediately corrected them: With the exception of Secretary of State Webster,Peterson, pp. 146–147. the new president had no allies in the cabinet, and moreover soon discovered that he had few in Congress either. Adhering to his states' rights, strict-constructionist ideology and having joined the Whigs only in opposition to Andrew Jackson, he did not embrace the American System of internal improvements, protective tariffs, and national bank proposals of the party leaders. Following Tyler's veto of several Whig banking bills, in September 1841 all the members of the cabinet except Webster resigned in protest, a maneuver that Clay had engineered. Having suspected that much of the cabinet would resign, Tyler quickly put together a new cabinet consisting of Whigs opposed to Clay.May, pp. 75–76 Webster had long struggled with his role in the Whig Party and the Tyler administration, and he finally resigned from the cabinet in May 1843.Peterson, pp. 167–169, 180. Abel Upshur replaced Webster as Secretary of State, and he focused on Tyler's priority of annexing the Republic of Texas. In hopes of building up his own party of Southern Whigs and Northern Democrats, the Tyler administration removed several other important officials in favor of \\"Tyler Men.\\" One of these supposed loyalists, Thomas Gilmer, replaced Upshur as Secretary of the Navy.May, pp. 99-101. The shakeup left Tyler's cabinet composed equally of Democrats and Whigs.Peterson, p. 183. Many of Tyler's later appointments, including Upshur and Gilmer, were followers of Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina; unknown to Tyler, their actions were calculated to boost Calhoun's 1844 presidential candidacy.Peterson, p. 187. After Upshur and Gilmer were both killed in a naval accident in early 1844, Tyler brought in Calhoun as Secretary of State and John Y. Mason of Virginia as Secretary of the Navy.Peterson, pp. 203–204, 210. Later that year, Secretary of the Treasury John C. Spencer left the cabinet and was replaced by George M. Bibb, leaving Tyler's cabinet with just one Northerner, Secretary of War William Wilkins.Peterson, p. 231. Tyler was the first president to have his cabinet nominees rejected by the Senate. The four rejected nominees were Caleb Cushing (Treasury), David Henshaw (Navy), James Porter (War), and James S. Green (Treasury). Henshaw and Porter served as recess appointees before their rejections. Tyler repeatedly renominated Cushing, who was rejected three times in one day, March 3, 1843, the last day of the 27th Congress. After the end of Tyler's term, a cabinet nominee would not again be rejected by the Senate until the 1860s. Judicial appointments As they did with his cabinet nominees, Tyler's opponents repeatedly thwarted his judicial nominations. Two vacancies occurred on the Supreme Court during Tyler's presidency, as Justices Smith Thompson and Henry Baldwin died in 1843 and 1844, respectively. Tyler, ever at odds with Congress, put forward five men for Supreme Court confirmation a total of nine times. John C. Spencer, Reuben Walworth, Edward King all had their nominations scuttled more than once, and the full Senate never acted on John M. Read's nomination. The Whig-controlled Senate rejected Tyler's nominees in part because they wanted to leave the seats open for the next president, who they hoped would be Henry Clay.Peterson, pp. 210–211. Finally, on February 14, 1845, with less than a month remaining in his term, Tyler's nomination of Samuel Nelson to Thompson's seat was confirmed by the Senate. Nelson, a Democrat, had a reputation as a careful and noncontroversial jurist. Still, his confirmation came as a surprise. He would serve on the Supreme Court until 1872. Baldwin's seat remained vacant until James K. Polk's nominee, Robert Grier, was confirmed August 4, 1846. Tyler made six other successful nominations to the federal bench while in office, all to federal district courts. Economic policy and party conflicts Whig policies President Harrison had been expected to adhere closely to Whig Party policies and to defer to congressional leaders, particularly Clay. Though he would clash with Whig leaders over other policies, Tyler assented to parts of the Whig legislative program, including repeal of the Independent Treasury that had been created under President Van Buren.May, pp. 67–68 Tyler also signed the Preemption Act of 1841, which was designed to facilitate settlement of the West. The act allowed settlers to buy 160 acre plots of land in the West without having to compete for the land in an auction. That same act included a distribution program in which states received revenue from the land sales through which they could fund infrastructure projects and make other investments. At Tyler's insistence, the distribution program would only remain in effect if tariff rates were kept below 20 percent. Another Whig policy, the Bankruptcy Act of 1841, allowed individuals to declare bankruptcy. The act was the first law in U.S. history that allowed for voluntary bankruptcy.Howe, pp. 592–593. National bank Once Congress voted to repeal the Independent Treasury, the Whigs turned their attention to the creation of a restored national bank, which they hoped would replace the Independent Treasury as the depository of government funds.Peterson, pp. 61, 67. The federal charter of the Second Bank of the United States had expired after Andrew Jackson vetoed a bill to re-charter it, and Clay made the establishment of a new national bank the centerpiece of his legislative agenda. Clay's advocacy was motivated in part by the poor economic conditions inherited from the Van Buren administration; he and his allies argued that the re-establishment of a national bank would help lift the economy.Peterson, pp. 57–59, 61. Despite Tyler's long-standing opposition to the national bank, Clay was determined to enact his American System into law with the Whig congressional majority. In June 1841, Treasury Secretary Thomas Ewing proposed a national bank bill that reflected Tyler's strict construction of the Constitution; the bank would be headquartered in Washington, D.C., with branches only in those states that consented to the bank's presence. Clay dismissed the Tyler administration's proposal, and promoted his own legislation that would allow the bank to operate with or without the consent of states. Clay's bill passed Congress on August 6, and Tyler vetoed the bill on August 16. Not only did Tyler think that the bill was unconstitutional, but he also came to view the struggle over the national bank as a personal struggle between himself and Clay, with control of the country at stake. In reaction to the veto, numerous Whigs and Whig newspapers denounced Tyler.May, pp. 68–71 Tyler agreed to support an effort to craft a compromise bank bill that would meet his objections, and the cabinet developed another version of the bill.May, pp. 72–73 Congress passed a bill based on Treasury Secretary Ewing's proposal, but Tyler vetoed that bill as well.Howe, pp. 591–592. Tyler's second veto infuriated Whigs throughout the country, inspiring numerous anti-Tyler rallies and angry letters to the White House.May, pp. 73–74 On September 11, members of the cabinet entered Tyler's office one by one and resigned—an orchestration by Clay to force Tyler's resignation and place his own lieutenant, Senate President pro tempore Samuel L. Southard, in the White House. The lone cabinet member who did not resign was Webster, who remained both to finalize what became the 1842 Webster–Ashburton Treaty and to demonstrate his independence from Clay.Roseboom, p. 124. When told by Webster that he was willing to stay, Tyler is reported to have said, \\"Give me your hand on that, and now I will say to you that Henry Clay is a doomed man.\\" On September 13, when the president did not resign or give in, the Whigs in Congress expelled Tyler from the party.Chitwood, pp. 249–51. Whigs in Congress were so angry with Tyler that they refused to allocate funds to fix the White House, which had fallen into disrepair.Kleber, p. 699. As the Whigs had repealed the Independent Treasury but had been unable to craft a replacement, the federal government deposited its money in state-charted banks.Howe, p. 592. Following a congressional recess, Tyler proposed the \\"Exchequer Plan\\" as a replacement for the national bank. The Exchequer Plan would establish a government agency overseen by presidential appointees that would store government funds and issue banknotes. Webster argued that the agency would be \\"the most beneficial measure of any sort ever adopted in this country, the Constitution only excepted.\\" Despite Webster's enthusiasm, the plan was not seriously considered by Congress, as Whigs still wanted a national bank and Democrats favored the restoration of the Independent Treasury.Peterson, pp. 98–100. In early 1842, Clay resigned from Congress to focus on the upcoming presidential election. Following Clay's resignation, the idea for a new national bank lay dormant for the remainder of Tyler's presidency, and Congress moved on to other issues.May, pp. 79–80 Tariff and distribution debate Whig cartoon depicting the effects of unemployment on a family that has Jackson's and Van Buren's portraits on the wall Due to the ongoing economic troubles of the Panic of 1837, as well as the relatively low tariff rates set by the Tariff of 1833, the government faced a growing budget deficit.Howe, p. 593. Congressional Whigs wanted to raise the tariff, both to provide federal revenue and to protect domestic industry. Yet Whig leaders also wanted to extend the distribution program, which was set to expire if tariff rates were raised above twenty percent.Howe, pp. 593–594. In June 1842, the Whig Congress passed two bills that would raise tariffs and unconditionally extend the distribution program. Believing it improper to continue distribution at a time when federal revenue shortage necessitated increasing the tariff, Tyler vetoed both bills, burning any remaining bridges between himself and the Whigs.Chitwood, pp. 297–300; Seager, p. 167. Congress tried again, combining the two into one bill; Tyler vetoed it again, to the outrage of many in Congress, who nevertheless failed to override the veto. As some action was necessary to address the budget deficit, Whigs in Congress, led by the House Ways and Means Chairman Millard Fillmore, passed in each house by one vote a bill restoring tariffs to 1832 levels and ending the distribution program. Tyler signed the Tariff of 1842 on August 30, pocket vetoing a separate bill to restore distribution.Peterson, pp. 103–08. Impeachment proceedings Shortly after the tariff vetoes, Whigs in the House of Representatives initiated American history's first impeachment proceedings against a president. The Whig drive for impeachment was motivated by more than the difference of opinion over the tariff and other issues. Tyler's actions violated the Whig concept of the presidency, as party leaders believed the president should be deferential to Congress in regards to legislation and domestic policy. This view was at least partly rooted in how previous presidents had acted. Until the presidency of the Whigs' arch-enemy Andrew Jackson, presidents had rarely vetoed bills, and then, generally only on the grounds of whether or not the bill was unconstitutional.The Presidents: A Reference History, edited by Henry F. Graff, 2nd edition (1996), pg. 115 (essay by Richard B. Latner). In July 1842, Congressman John Botts introduced a resolution levying several charges against Tyler and calling for a nine- member committee to investigate his behavior, with the expectation that this committee would issue a formal impeachment recommendation. Clay found this measure prematurely aggressive, favoring a more moderate progression toward Tyler's \\"inevitable\\" impeachment. The Botts resolution was tabled until the following January, when it was rejected, 127−83.Chitwood, p. 303.Seager, p. 169. Despite the rejection of the Botts resolution, a House select committee, headed by John Quincy Adams, condemned the president's use of the veto and assailed his character. The committee published a report that did not formally recommend impeachment, but clearly established the possibility for impeachment proceedings. In August 1842, by a vote of 98–90, the House endorsed the committee's report. Adams also sponsored a constitutional amendment to make it easier for Congress to override vetoes, but neither house passed such a measure.Chitwood, pp. 300–01.Seager, pp. 167–68. Ultimately, the Whigs did not impeach Tyler, since they believed that his likely acquittal would devastate the party.Peterson, pp. 169–170. 1842 mid-term elections The Whigs lost numerous races in the 1842 mid-term elections, as the country continued to suffer from the effects of the Panic of 1837. The Whigs had promised \\"relief and reform,\\" and voters punished the party for the lack of change.May, pp. 78–79 Democrats took control of the House, and Tyler felt vindicated by the defeat of the congressional Whigs. Both parties, intent on electing their own candidates in the 1844 election, largely continued to oppose Tyler.Monroe, pp. 145–147 No major legislation would pass in the lame duck session of the 27th Congress or in the 28th Congress.Peterson, p. 173. Near the end of Tyler's term in office, on March 3, 1845, Congress overrode his veto of a minor bill relating to revenue cutters. This was the first successful override of any presidential veto in U.S. history.Seager, p. 283. Foreign and military affairs Relations with Britain =Webster–Ashburton Treaty= With his domestic agenda frustrated in Congress, Tyler worked with Secretary of State Webster to pursue an ambitious foreign policy.Peterson, pp. 113, 145. Webster sought to conclude a major treaty with Great Britain to bring an end to simmering tensions between the two countries. Anglo-American diplomatic relations had reached a low point in the aftermath of the Caroline affair and the Aroostook War of the late 1830s. Webster and other Whig leaders favored closer relations with Britain in order to spur British investment in the ailing U.S. economy, while Tyler pursued a conciliatory policy with the British in order to win their acquiescence to the U.S. annexation of Texas.Howe, pp. 675–677. As part of this conciliatory policy, Tyler administration launched a secret propaganda campaign to influence public opinion in favor of an Anglo-American treaty that would settle the border between Maine and Canada.May, pp. 84-86. That issue, which had not been settled in the Treaty of Paris or the Treaty of Ghent, had strained relations between the United States and Britain for decades.May, pp. 82-83. British diplomat Lord Ashburton arrived in Washington in April 1842, and after months of negotiations the United States and Britain agreed to the Webster–Ashburton Treaty in August 1842.May, pp. 86-88. Delegates from Maine, who had been invited by Webster to ensure that state's support, somewhat reluctantly agreed to support the treaty.Peterson, pp. 120–122. The treaty clearly delineated Maine's Northern border, as well as other sections of the U.S.-Canada border that had been in dispute. The treaty also included a pledge by the United States to step up enforcement against the Atlantic slave trade.Peterson, pp. 122–123, 128. Senator Thomas Hart Benton led Senate opposition to the treaty, arguing that it \\"needlessly and shamelessly\\" relinquished American territory, but few others joined Benton in resisting the treaty.Peterson, pp. 129–130. The Webster–Ashburton Treaty won Senate ratification in a 39-to-9 vote, and it became popular among Americans, although few from either party gave Tyler credit for it.May, pp. 89-90. The treaty represented an important point in the growing warmth of Anglo-American relations after the War of 1812, as it showed that both countries accepted joint control of North America. American expansionists would instead focus on Mexico, while the British government under Robert Peel was freed to turn its attention to domestic and European issues.Herring, pp. 184-187. =Oregon= Tyler also sought a treaty with the British regarding the partition of Oregon Country, which the two countries had jointly occupied since the signing of the Treaty of 1818.Seager, p. 213. Britain and the United States had intermittently engaged in discussions over a partition of the territory, but had been unable to come to an agreement. The British favored extending the U.S.-Canadian border west along the 49th parallel north until it met the Columbia River, at which point that river would serve as the boundary. For the U.S., a major goal was the acquisition of a deepwater port site in the Puget Sound; the lone deepwater port site in the region lay north of the Columbia River but south of the 49th parallel.Peterson, pp. 135–136. Tyler also believed that the acquisition of part of the territory would help make the simultaneous annexation of Texas more palatable to Northerners.Peterson, pp. 192–193. As more and more Americans traveled along the Oregon Trail to settle in Oregon Country, the status of the territory became an increasingly important issue. Some Americans, like Charles Wilkes of the United States Exploring Expedition, favored claiming the entire territory, which extended up to the 54°40′ parallel.Peterson, pp. 136–137. Tyler's enthusiasm for an agreement with Britain regarding Oregon was not shared by Upshur and Calhoun, both of whom focused on the annexation of Texas.Peterson, pp. 266–267. Acquisition of the territory would become a major campaign issue in the 1844 election, with many expansionists calling for expansion of the entire territory.Herring, pp. 188-189. In 1846, the United States and Britain would come to an agreement to partition Oregon along the lines that had been advocated by Tyler. Pacific The return of the United States Exploring Expedition in 1842 stimulated American interest in trade with Asia. Tyler sought to establish an American harbor on the Pacific Ocean either in the Puget Sound or in San Francisco, but his administration was unable to establish undisputed control over either territory. Webster attempted to convince the British to pressure Mexico to sell San Francisco, but neither the British nor the Mexicans were interested in this proposal.Peterson, pp. 137–140. Previous administrations had shown little interest in the Hawaiian Islands, but American traders had become influential in the islands, which held an important location in Pacific trade. At Webster's urging, Tyler announced in 1842 that the U.S. would oppose colonization of the Hawaiian islands by any European power. This policy, which effectively extended the Monroe Doctrine to Hawaii, became known as the Tyler Doctrine.Peterson, pp. 140–141. Eager to compete with Great Britain in international markets, Tyler sent lawyer Caleb Cushing to China, where Cushing negotiated the terms of the 1844 Treaty of Wanghia.Chitwood, pp. 330–32; Seager, pp. 210–11. The treaty, which was the first bilateral accord between the United States and China, contributed to greatly expanded trade between the two countries in subsequent years.Peterson, pp. 142–143. Dorr Rebellion Unlike most other states, by the early 1840s Rhode Island had not extended voting rights to all adult white men. Reformers like Thomas Dorr became increasingly dissatisfied with this state of affairs, and reformers sought a constitutional convention to update the Rhode Island Royal Charter of 1663, which continued to act as the state's constitution.Peterson, pp. 108–110. In the 1830s, Thomas Wilson Dorr, a Rhode Island state legislator, had formed a third party that called for universal manhood suffrage. In early 1842, Dorr established a rival government to that of Governor Samuel Ward King after a contested gubernatorial election.Howe, pp. 599–601. As the Dorr Rebellion came to a head, Tyler pondered the request of the governor and legislature to send federal troops to help it suppress the Dorrite insurgents. Tyler called for calm on both sides, and recommended that the governor enlarge the franchise to let most men vote. Tyler promised that in case an actual insurrection should break out in Rhode Island he would employ force to aid the regular, or Charter, government. He made it clear that federal assistance would be given, not to prevent, but only to put down insurrection, and would not be available until violence had been committed. After listening to reports from his confidential agents, Tyler decided that the 'lawless assemblages' had dispersed and expressed his confidence in a \\"temper of conciliation as well as of energy and decision.\\" He did not send any federal forces. The rebels fled the state when the state militia marched against them, but the incident led to broader suffrage in Rhode Island.Chitwood, pp. 326–30. Other issues Tyler and Secretary of the Navy Upshur advocated increased funding for and reforms to the navy so that it could protect American trade in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Many of Upshur's proposals, including the expansion of the naval officer corps and the establishment of a naval academy, were defeated in Congress. Upshur did preside over the conversion of many ships to steam power and helped establish the United States Naval Observatory.Peterson, pp. 150–153. Upshur also initiated the construction of the navy's first screw steam warship, the .Peterson, p. 201. Tyler brought the long, bloody Second Seminole War in Florida to an end in 1842, and expressed interest in the forced cultural assimilation of the Native Americans.Chitwood, p. 330. On March 3, 1845, Florida became the 27th state, as Tyler signed legislation admitting into the Union. The Tyler administration negotiated a commercial treaty with the Zollverein, a customs union of German states. The treaty lowered German duties on goods such as cotton and tobacco, and was particularly advantageous to Southern and Western interests. The treaty was considered at the same time that the Senate debated a treaty to annex Texas, and the hostile Whig Senate refused to ratify either treaty.Peterson, pp. 231–233. Annexation of Texas and abortive 1844 candidacy Background At the encouragement of Spanish authorities, many Americans had settled in Texas in the 1820s, and the region became part of Mexico following the Mexican War of Independence. The United States frequently attempted to buy Texas, but Mexico consistently rejected these offers. By 1836, Anglo-Americans outnumbered Hispanics in Texas by a two-to-one margin, and the American settlers continued to hold slaves despite a Mexican law barring slavery. After taking office as president of Mexico in 1833, Antonio López de Santa Anna centralizing policies triggered revolts, including the Texas Revolution. Under the command of Sam Houston, the forces of the Republic of Texas decisively defeated Santa Anna's army at the Battle of San Jacinto. Following the battle, Santa Anna agreed to sign the Treaties of Velasco, which Texas leaders saw as an acknowledgment of Texan independence. The Mexican Congress refused to ratify the treaty, which had been obtained from Santa Anna under duress, and Mexico continued to regard Texas as a breakaway province. Mexico launched expeditions to retake control of Texas in subsequent years, but these expeditions proved unsuccessful.Howe, pp. 658–669. The people of Texas actively pursued joining the United States, but Jackson and Van Buren had been reluctant to inflame tensions over slavery by annexing another slave-holding state. Texas leaders simultaneously courted the British in the hopes that they would provide economic, military, and diplomatic aid against Mexico.Howe, pp. 671–672. Upon taking office, Tyler was strongly in favor of accomplishing annexation, but Secretary Webster's opposition convinced Tyler to focus on Pacific initiatives until later in his term.Crapol, pp. 176–78. The boundaries of the United States and neighboring nations as they appeared in 1843. The Webster–Ashburton Treaty had formalized the border of Maine in the northeast, while the Republic of Texas in the southwest had a disputed border with Mexico. Tyler shared the Texans' desire for annexation, but it took several years of political wrangling to achieve. Although Tyler's desire for western expansionism is agreed upon by historians and scholars, views differ regarding the motivations behind it. Biographer Edward C. Crapol notes that during the presidency of James Monroe, Tyler (then in the House of Representatives) had suggested slavery was a \\"dark cloud\\" hovering over the Union, and that it would be \\"well to disperse this cloud\\" so that with fewer blacks in the older slave states, a process of gradual emancipation would begin in Virginia and other upper Southern states.Crapol, 2006, p. 5: \\"Tyler's solution was a further expansion of slavery and the admission of Missouri as a slave state. He saw territorial expansion as a way to thin out and diffuse the slave population.\\" Historian William W. Freehling, however, wrote that Tyler's main motivation in annexing Texas was to outmaneuver suspected efforts by Great Britain to promote an emancipation of slaves in Texas that would weaken the institution in the United States.Freehling, 1991, p. 398: \\"Tyler and [Secretary of State] Upshur opted for annexation only after a public parliamentary exchange confirmed...that England had 'earnestly' pressed Mexico to pressure Texas towards abolition [of slavery].\\" Norma Lois Peterson writes that Tyler believed annexation would be the defining accomplishment of his administration and boost his prospects for re-election.Peterson, p.187. Negotiations under Upshur In early 1843, having completed the Webster–Ashburton treaty and other diplomatic efforts, Tyler felt ready to wholeheartedly pursue Texas. As a trial balloon, he dispatched his ally Thomas Walker Gilmer, then a congressman from Virginia, to publish a letter defending annexation, which was well received. Despite his successful relationship with Webster, Tyler knew he would need a Secretary of State who supported the Texas initiative. With Webster's work on the British treaty now completed, Tyler replaced Webster with Hugh S. Legaré of South Carolina.Crapol, pp. 180–83, 186. With the help of newly appointed Treasury Secretary John C. Spencer, Tyler cleared out an array of officeholders, replacing them with pro- annexation partisans, in a reversal of his former stand against patronage. He elicited the help of political organizer Michael Walsh to build a political machine in New York. In exchange for an appointment as consul to Hawaii, journalist Alexander G. Abell wrote a flattering biography, Life of John Tyler, which was printed in large quantities and given to postmasters to distribute.Crapol, pp. 183–85. Seeking to rehabilitate his public image, Tyler embarked on a nationwide tour in the spring of 1843. The positive reception of the public at these events contrasted with his ostracism back in Washington. The tour centered on the dedication of the Bunker Hill Monument in Boston, Massachusetts. Shortly after the dedication, Tyler learned of Legaré's sudden death, which dampened the festivities and caused him to cancel the rest of the tour.Crapol, pp. 185–94. Following the death of Legaré, Tyler appointed Secretary of the Navy Abel Upshur as his new Secretary of State. Upshur and his adviser, Duff Green, believed that Britain sought to convince Texas to abolish slavery in a complicated scheme designed to undermine the interests of the Southern United States.Peterson, pp. 186–187. Though the government of British Prime Minister Robert Peel in fact had little interest in pushing abolitionism in Texas, the fear of such a scheme motivated Upshur to pursue annexation as quickly as possible in order to preserve slavery in Texas.Howe, pp. 677–678. Tyler and Upshur began quiet negotiations with the Texas government, promising military protection from Mexico in exchange for a commitment to annexation. Secrecy was necessary, as the Constitution required congressional approval for such military commitments. Upshur planted rumors of possible British designs on Texas to drum up support among Northern voters, who were wary of admitting a new pro-slavery state.Crapol, pp. 194–97. Texas leaders, meanwhile, were reluctant to sign any annexation treaty that might be rejected by the U.S. Senate.Peterson, pp. 194–195. Despite the continued skepticism of Texan leaders, the negotiators finalized the terms of an annexation treaty before the end of February 1844.Crapol, pp. 202–10. Under the terms of the treaty, Texas would join as a territory with statehood to follow later, and the United States would assume both the public lands and the public debt of Texas.Peterson, pp. 211–212. USS Princeton disaster A lithograph of the Princeton disaster (1844). A ceremonial cruise down the Potomac River was held aboard the newly built on February 28, 1844, the day after completion of the annexation treaty. Aboard the ship were 400 guests, including Tyler and his cabinet, as well as the world's largest naval gun, the \\"Peacemaker.\\" The gun was ceremonially fired several times in the afternoon to the great delight of the onlookers. Several hours later, Captain Robert F. Stockton was convinced by the crowd to fire one more shot.Crapol, pp. 207–09; Seager, pp. 204–06. A malfunction caused an explosion that killed Gilmer and Upshur, as well Virgil Maxcy, David Gardiner, Commodore Beverly Kennon, and Armistead, Tyler's black slave and body servant. Having remained safely below deck, Tyler was unhurt. The death of David Gardiner had a devastating effect on David's daughter, Julia Gardiner, who fainted and was carried to safety by the president himself. Julia later recovered from her grief and married President Tyler.Seager, p. 208. Appointment of Calhoun An anti-Tyler satire lampoons his efforts to secure a second term. Tyler pushes the door shut on opponents Clay, Polk, Calhoun, and Jackson, as Uncle Sam demands that he let Clay in. In early March 1844, Tyler appointed Senator John C. Calhoun as his Secretary of State. Tyler's good friend, Virginia Representative Henry A. Wise, wrote that following the Princeton disaster, Wise went on his own to extend Calhoun the position through a colleague, who assumed that the offer came from the president. When Wise went to tell Tyler what he had done, the president was angry but felt that the action now had to stand. Though Tyler had long been hesitant to bring the ambitious Calhoun into his cabinet, some historians have cast doubt on Wise's interpretation of events.Peterson, pp. 204–205. Regardless of Tyler's motivations for appointing Calhoun, the decision was a serious tactical error that ruined any hopes Tyler had had for establishing his own political respectability. Calhoun favored Texas annexation and had a strong following in the South. But in the eyes of Northerners, Calhoun was the symbol of Nullification and efforts to extend slavery, and his appointment undercut Tyler's attempts to disassociate the issue of Texas from the issue of slavery.May, pp. 109–111. In April 1844, Calhoun and two Texas negotiators signed the treaty providing for the annexation of Texas.Howe, p. 679. When the text of the annexation treaty was leaked to the public, it met opposition from the Whigs, who would oppose anything that might enhance Tyler's status, as well as from foes of slavery and those who feared a confrontation with Mexico, which had announced that it would view annexation as a hostile act by the United States. Both Clay and Van Buren, the respective frontrunners for the Whig and Democratic nominations, decided to come out against annexation.Crapol, pp. 212–17. Knowing this, when Tyler sent the treaty to the Senate for ratification in April 1844, he did not expect it to pass.Seager, p. 218. 1844 candidacy Following Tyler's break with the Whigs in 1841, he had begun to shift back to his old Democratic party, but its members, especially the followers of Van Buren, were not ready to receive him. Tyler knew that, with little chance of election, the only way to salvage his presidency and legacy was to move public opinion in favor of the Texas issue. He formed a third party, the Democratic-Republicans, using the officeholders and political networks he had built over the previous year. A chain of pro-Tyler newspapers across the country put out editorials promoting his candidacy throughout the early months of 1844. Reports of meetings held throughout the country suggest that support for the president was not limited to officeholders. The Tyler supporters, holding signs reading \\"Tyler and Texas!\\", held their nominating convention in May 1844, just as the Democratic Party was holding its own presidential convention.Crapol, p. 218; Seager, pp. 228–29. Midway through Tyler's presidency, the Democrats were badly divided, especially between followers of Calhoun and Van Buren. Former Vice President Richard Mentor Johnson of Kentucky, former Secretary of War Lewis Cass of Michigan, and Senator James Buchanan of Pennsylvania also loomed as contenders for the 1844 Democratic presidential nomination.Peterson, pp. 175–176. By late 1843, Van Buren had emerged as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, and Calhoun decided that he would not seek the nomination.Peterson, p. 197. As proponents of the annexation of Texas came to oppose his candidacy, Van Buren's strength in the party diminished.Peterson, pp. 219, 222–223. At the 1844 Democratic National Convention, Van Buren failed to win the necessary super-majority of Democratic votes. It was not until the ninth ballot that the Democrats turned their sights to James K. Polk, a less prominent candidate who supported annexation. A protege of Andrew Jackson, Polk had hoped to win the vice presidential nomination prior to the convention, but Democratic delegates instead made Polk the first \\"dark horse\\" presidential nominee in U.S. history. Polk's nomination pleased the followers of Calhoun, and they threw their support behind his candidacy rather than Tyler's.Howe, pp. 683–684. Clay, meanwhile, had been nominated for president at the 1844 Whig National Convention.Peterson, pp. 221–222. Ongoing debates and the 1844 election The full Senate began to debate the Senate annexation treaty in mid-May 1844, and it rejected the treaty by a vote of 16–35 on June 8. Most of the support for the treaty came from Democrats who represented slave states.Peterson, p. 228. Changing tactics, Tyler submitted the treaty to the House of Representatives. He hoped to convince Congress to annex Texas by joint resolution, which required a simple majority vote in both houses of Congress rather than a two-thirds vote in the Senate.Peterson, pp. 229–230. The debate over Texas, as well as Oregon to a lesser degree, dominated American political discourse throughout mid-1844.Peterson, pp. 234–235. Former President Andrew Jackson, a staunch supporter of annexation, persuaded Polk to welcome Tyler back into the Democratic Party and ordered Democratic editors to cease their attacks on him. Satisfied by these developments, Tyler dropped out of the race in August and endorsed Polk for the presidency. Tyler thus became the first sitting president to decline to seek a second term.May, pp. 119–121. In the public letter announcing his withdrawal, Tyler stated his belief that Polk's administration \\"will be a continuance of my own, since he will be found the advocate of most of my measures.\\"Peterson, pp. 239–241. 1844 electoral vote results Clay had been confident of his own election after the Democratic convention, but his doubts grew as the election neared.Peterson, p. 241. Democrats like Robert Walker recast the issue of Texas annexation, arguing that Texas and as Oregon were rightfully American but had been lost during the Monroe administration. Walker further argued that Texas would provide a market for Northern goods and would allow for the \\"diffusion\\" of slavery, which in turn would lead to gradual emancipation.Howe, pp. 684–685. In response, Clay argued that the annexation of Texas would bring war with Mexico and increase sectional tensions.Howe, p. 686. Ultimately, Polk triumphed in an extremely close election, defeating Clay 170-105 in the Electoral College; the flip of just a few thousand voters in New York would have given the election to Clay. The candidate of the abolitionist Liberty Party, James G. Birney, won several thousand anti-annexation votes in New York, and his presence in the race may have cost Clay the election.Howe, p. 688. Aside from New York, Clay lost several states that Harrison had won, including Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Maine, and Pennsylvania. In the concurrent congressional elections, the Democrats won control of the Senate and retained control of the House.Peterson, pp. 243–244. Annexation achieved After the election, Tyler announced in his annual message to Congress that \\"a controlling majority of the people and a large majority of the states have declared in favor of immediate annexation.\\"Crapol, pp. 218–20; Seager, pp. 236–41, 246. Congress debated annexation between December 1844 and February 1845. Polk's arrival in Washington, and his support for immediate annexation, helped unite Democrats behind Tyler's proposal to annex Texas by joint resolution.Peterson, pp. 255–257. In late February 1845, the House by a substantial margin and the Senate by a bare 27–25 majority approved a joint resolution offering terms of annexation to Texas. Every Democratic senator voted for the bill, as did three Southern Whig senators.Howe, p. 699. On March 1, three days before the end of his term, Tyler signed the annexation bill into law.Crapol, p. 220; Seager, pp. 282–83. The bill allowed the president to either re-open annexation negotiations or to extend an offer of statehood. It differed from Tyler's proposed treaty in that the United States would not take on the public lands or the public debt of Texas. On March 3, the final full day of his presidency, Tyler extended an offer of annexation and statehood to Texas through his envoy, Andrew Jackson Donelson. Upon taking office, Polk considered withdrawing the offer, but he ultimately decided to uphold Tyler's decision.Peterson, pp. 257–258. After some debate,The Presidents: A Reference History, edited by Henry F. Graff, 2nd edition (1996), pg. 160–61 (essay by David M. Pletcher) Texas accepted the terms and entered the union on December 29, 1845, as the 28th state. Personal life Amidst the troubles in his administration, Tyler had to deal with personal tragedies as well. His wife, Letitia, had been ill for some time, and did not participate in White House functions. She suffered a second stroke and died on September 10, 1842. After just five months, Tyler began courting the most beautiful and sought-after socialite in Washington, D.C., Julia Gardiner, who at 22 years of age was 30 years younger than the president, and younger than some of his seven children. They were married in a small ceremony on June 26, 1844 in the Church of the Ascension, New York City. This was the first time a president married while in office, and the wedding was widely covered by newspapers.May, pp. 116–118. Historical reputation While academics and experts have both praised and criticized Tyler, the general public has little awareness of him at all. He was among the nation's most obscure presidents. In 2014 Time magazine rerviewed the \\"Top 10 Forgettable Presidents\\": Nevertheless Tyler's presidency has provoked highly divided responses. It is generally held in low esteem by historians; Edward P. Crapol began his biography John Tyler, the Accidental President (2006) by noting: \\"Other biographers and historians have argued that John Tyler was a hapless and inept chief executive whose presidency was seriously flawed.\\" In The Republican Vision of John Tyler (2003), Dan Monroe observed that the Tyler presidency \\"is generally ranked as one of the least successful\\". Seager wrote that Tyler \\"was neither a great president nor a great intellectual,\\" adding that despite a few achievements, \\"his administration has been and must be counted an unsuccessful one by any modern measure of accomplishment\\".Seager, p. xvi. A 2018 poll of the American Political Science Association's Presidents and Executive Politics section ranked Tyler as the 36th best president, while a 2017 C-Span poll of historians ranked Tyler as the 39th best president. thumb left220pxalt=Historical ten-cent stamp with Tyler's profile.John Tyler appears on the ten-cent U.S. Postage stamp of the 1938 Presidential Series. Others have expressed more positive view of Tyler, especially regarding foreign policy. Monroe credits him with \\"achievements like the Webster–Ashburton treaty which heralded the prospect of improved relations with Great Britain, and the annexation of Texas, which added millions of acres to the national domain.\\" Crapol argued that Tyler \\"was a stronger and more effective president than generally remembered\\", while Seager wrote, \\"I find him to be a courageous, principled man, a fair and honest fighter for his beliefs. He was a president without a party.\\" Pointing to Tyler's advances in foreign policy and external factors such as Clay's determination to dominate Tyler's administration, Norma Lois Peterson deemed Tyler's presidency \\"flawed ... but ... not a failure\\".Peterson, p. 265. In Recarving Rushmore, libertarian author Ivan Eland ranked Tyler as the best president of all time. Louis Kleber, in his article in History Today, pointed out that Tyler brought integrity to the White House at a time when many in politics lacked it, and refused to compromise his principles to avoid the anger of his opponents.Kleber, p. 703. By decisive action and adroit political maneuvering during his first weeks in office, Tyler forever made moot any future constitutional objections and established by usage the precedent for the vice president to become president on the death of an incumbent.Crapol, p. 9. His successful insistence that he was president, and not a caretaker or acting president, was a model for the succession of seven other presidents over the 19th and 20th centuries. Tyler's action of assuming both the title of the presidency and its full powers would be legally recognized in 1967, when it was codified in the Twenty-fifth Amendment.Crapol, p. 13. His use of veto power not only destroyed the Whig domestic program, but also established the precedent that the president could veto any bill passed by Congress.Spitzer, pp. 143-144 Jordan T. Cash concludes that: :The administration of John Tyler, therefore, shows us a strong isolated president exercising constitutional powers while still having some institutional restraints. It is an example of the executive alone in all its strengths and weaknesses, but primarily demonstrating the great inherent strength and power of the office in its constitutional, institutional, and political capacities.Jordan T.

Polk began on March 4, 1845, when James K. Polk was inaugurated as President of the United States, and ended on March 4, 1849. He was a Democrat, and assumed office after defeating Whig Henry Clay in the 1844 presidential election. Polk left office after one term, fulfilling a campaign pledge he made in 1844, and he was succeeded by Whig Zachary Taylor. A close ally of Andrew Jackson, Polk's presidency reflected his adherence to the ideals of Jacksonian democracy and manifest destiny. Polk was the last strong pre-Civil War president, having met during his four years in office every major domestic and foreign policy goal set during his campaign and the transition to his administration. Polk's presidency was particularly influential in U.S. foreign policy, and his presidency saw the last major expansions of the Contiguous United States. When Mexico rejected the U.S. annexation of Texas, Polk achieved a sweeping victory in the Mexican–American War, which resulted in the cession by Mexico of nearly the whole of what is now the American Southwest. He threatened war with the United Kingdom over control of the Oregon Country, eventually reaching an agreement in which both nations agreed to partition the region at the 49th parallel. Polk also accomplished his goals in domestic policy. He ensured a substantial reduction of tariff rates by replacing the \\"Black Tariff\\" with the Walker tariff of 1846, which pleased the less-industrialized states of his native South by rendering less expensive both imported and, through competition, domestic goods. Additionally, he built an independent treasury system that lasted until 1913, oversaw the opening of the U.S. Naval Academy and of the Smithsonian Institution, the groundbreaking for the Washington Monument, and the issuance of the first United States postage stamp. Polk did not closely involve himself in the 1848 presidential election, but his actions strongly affected the race. General Zachary Taylor, who had served in the Mexican–American War, won the Whig presidential nomination and defeated Polk's preferred candidate, Democratic Senator Lewis Cass. Scholars have ranked Polk favorably on lists of greatest presidents for his ability to promote, obtain support for, and achieve all of the major items on his presidential agenda. However, he has also been criticized for leading the country into war against Mexico and for exacerbating sectional divides. Polk has been called the \\"least known consequential president\\" of the United States.The Overlooked President from TheDailyBeast.com 1844 election In the months leading up to the 1844 Democratic National Convention, former President Martin Van Buren was widely seen as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. Polk, who desired to be the party's vice-presidential nominee in the 1844 election,Merry p. 43-44 engaged in a delicate and subtle campaign to become Van Buren's running mate.Merry p. 50-53 The potential annexation of the Republic of Texas by President John Tyler upended the presidential race; while Van Buren and the Whig frontrunner, Henry Clay, opposed the annexation and a potential war with Mexico over the disputed territory,Merry p. 75 Polk and former President Andrew Jackson strongly supported the territorial acquisition.Merry p. 68-69 Disappointed by Van Buren's position, Jackson threw his support behind Polk for the party's 1844 nomination.Merry p. 80 When the Democratic National Convention began on May 27, 1844, the key question was whether the convention would adopt a rule requiring the presidential nominee to receive the vote of two-thirds of the delegates.Merry, pg. 84-85 With the strong support of the Southern states, the two thirds-rule was passed by the convention, effectively ending the possibility of Van Buren's nomination due to the strong opposition he faced from an unyielding and significant minority of delegates.Merry, pg. 87-88 Van Buren won a majority on the first presidential ballot, but failed to win the necessary super-majority, and support for Van Buren faded on subsequent ballots. On the eighth presidential ballot, Polk won 44 of the 266 delegates, as support for all candidates other than Polk, Lewis Cass, and Van Buren dissipated.Merry, pg. 92-94 Following the eighth ballot, several delegates rose to speak in support of Polk's candidacy. Van Buren, then realizing that he had no chance of ever winning the 1844 presidential nomination, threw his support behind Polk, who won on the next ballot. In doing so, Polk became the first \\"dark horse\\" candidate ever to win a major U.S. political party's presidential nomination. After Senator Silas Wright, a close Van Buren ally, declined the vice presidential nomination, the convention nominated former Senator George M. Dallas of Pennsylvania as Polk's running mate.Merry, pg. 94-95 After learning of his nomination, Polk promised to serve only one term, believing that this would help him win the support of Democratic leaders such as Cass, Wright, John C. Calhoun, Thomas Hart Benton, and James Buchanan, all of whom had presidential aspirations.Merry, pp. 103-104Haynes, pp. 61–62 Further, he avoided taking a position on the protectionist Tariff of 1842, but appealed to the key state of Pennsylvania by using rhetoric favorable towards tariffs.Merry, pg. 99-100 In New York, another key swing state, Polk's campaign was greatly aided by the gubernatorial candidacy of Wright, who managed to unite the factions of the New York Democratic Party. Results of the 1844 presidential election The abolitionist Liberty party nominated Michigan's James G. Birney, while the 1844 Whig National Convention nominated Henry Clay on the first ballot. Notwithstanding that Polk had been Speaker of the House of Representatives and governor of Tennessee, Whig stump speakers scorned Polk, mocking him with the chant \\"Who is James K. Polk?\\" in reference to Polk's relative obscurity compared to both Van Buren or Clay.Merry, pg. 96-97 The Whigs blanketed the nation with hundreds of thousands of anti-Polk tracts, accusing him of being a puppet of the \\"slaveocracy\\" and a radical who would destroy the United States over the annexation of Texas. Democrats like Robert Walker recast the issue of Texas annexation, arguing that Texas and as Oregon were rightfully American but had been lost during the Monroe administration. Walker further argued that Texas would provide a market for Northern goods and would allow for the \\"diffusion\\" of slavery, which in turn would lead to gradual emancipation.Howe, pp. 684–685. In response, Clay argued that the annexation of Texas would bring war with Mexico and increase sectional tensions.Howe, p. 686. Ultimately, Polk triumphed in an extremely close election, defeating Clay 170-105 in the Electoral College; the flip of just a few thousand voters in New York would have given the election to Clay. Birney won several thousand anti-annexation votes in New York, and his presence in the race may have cost Clay the election.Howe, p. 688. Inauguration The inauguration of James K. Polk, as shown in the Illustrated London News, v. 6, April 19, 1845. Polk was inaugurated as the nation's 11th president on March 4, 1845, in a ceremony held on the East Portico of the United States Capitol. Chief Justice Roger Taney administered the oath of office. Polk's inauguration was the first presidential inauguration to be reported by telegraph and shown in a newspaper illustration (in The Illustrated London News). Polk's inaugural address, written with the help of Amos Kendall, was a message of hope and confidence. At 4,476 words, it is the second longest inaugural address, behind only that of William Henry Harrison. In his inaugural address, Polk touched on the Jacksonian principles that had guided his political career and Democratic Party positions that would guide his administration. A major theme of the speech was the nation's westward expansion. He detailed how important the addition of Texas to the Union was, and noted that Americans were moving into lands even further west (California and Oregon). He declared: At the time that Polk became president, the nation's population had doubled every twenty years since the American Revolution and had reached demographic parity with Britain.Merry, pg. 132-133 Polk's tenure saw continued technological improvements, including the expansion of railroads and increased use of the telegraph. These improved communications and growing demographics increasingly made the United States into a strong military power, and also stoked expansionism. Administration Cabinet Polk and his cabinet, Front row (left to right): John Y. Mason, William L. Marcy, James K. Polk, Robert J. Walker; Back row (left to right): Cave Johnson, George Bancroft (James Buchanan is absent). Polk governed with the help of his cabinet, in which he placed great importance. The cabinet regularly met twice a week, and Polk and his six cabinet members discussed all major issues during these meetings.Merry, pg. 134-135 Despite his reliance on his cabinet, Polk involved himself in the minutiae of the various departments, especially regarding the military.Merry, pg. 269-270 In selecting a new cabinet, Polk generally heeded Jackson's advice to avoid individuals who were themselves interested in the presidency, though he chose to nominate Buchanan for the crucial and prestigious position of Secretary of State.Merry, pg. 114-117Seigenthaler, pp. 104-106 Polk respected Buchanan's opinion and Buchanan played an important role in Polk's presidency, but the two often clashed over foreign policy and appointments.Merry, pg. 134, 220-221 Polk frequently considered dismissing Buchanan from office, as he suspected Buchanan of placing his own presidential aspirations above service to Polk, but Buchanan always managed to convince Polk of his loyalty.Merry, pg. 439-440 Polk put together an initial slate of cabinet choices that met with the approval of Andrew Jackson, who Polk met with in January 1845 for the last time, as Jackson died in June 1845. Cave Johnson, a close friend and ally of Polk, would be nominated for the position of Postmaster General. Though Polk was personally close with the incumbent Navy Secretary, John Y. Mason, he replaced him after Jackson insisted that none of Tyler's cabinet be retained. In his place, Polk selected George Bancroft, a historian who had played a crucial role in Polk's nomination. Polk also selected Senator Robert J. Walker of Mississippi as Attorney General.Merry, pg. 117-119 However, after news of Buchanan's selection for State was leaked, Vice President Dallas (an in-state rival of Buchanan) and a slew of Southerners insisted that Walker receive the higher position at Treasury.Merry, pg. 124-126 Polk instead chose to nominate Bancroft as a compromise at Treasury while nominating Mason as Attorney General and a New Yorker, William L. Marcy, as Secretary of War. Polk had intended the Marcy appointment to mollify Van Buren, but Van Buren was outraged at the move, in part due to Marcy's affiliation with the rival \\"Hunker\\" faction. Polk then further enraged Van Buren by finally choosing Walker for Treasury; Bancroft was shifted back to Navy Secretary.Merry, pg. 127 After the outbreak of the Mexican-American War, Polk shook up his cabinet, sending Bancroft to Great Britain as an ambassador, shifting Mason to his old position of Navy Secretary, and successfully nominating Nathan Clifford as Attorney General.Merry, pg. 282 Goals According to a story told decades later by George Bancroft, Polk set four clearly defined goals for his administration:Merry, pg. 131-132 * Reestablish the Independent Treasury System. * Reduce tariffs. * Acquire some or all of Oregon Country. * Acquire California and New Mexico from Mexico. While his domestic aims represented continuity with past Democratic policies, successful completion of Polk's foreign policy goals would represent the first major American territorial gains since the Adams–Onís Treaty of 1819. Judicial appointments The 1844 death of Justice Henry Baldwin had created a vacancy on the Supreme Court, and Tyler's failure to fill the seat left a Supreme Court seat open when Polk took office. Polk's attempt to fill Baldwin's seat became embroiled in Pennsylvania politics and the efforts of factional leaders to secure the lucrative post of Collector of Customs for the Port of Philadelphia. As Polk sought to find his way through the minefield of Pennsylvania politics, a second position on the high court became vacant with the death, in September 1845, of Justice Joseph Story; his replacement was expected to come from his native New England. Because Story's death had occurred while the Senate was not in session, Polk was able to make a recess appointment, choosing Senator Levi Woodbury of New Hampshire, and when the Senate reconvened in December 1845, the Senate confirmed the appointment of Woodbury. Polk's initial nominee for Baldwin's seat, George W. Woodward, was rejected by the Senate in January 1846, in large part due to the opposition of Buchanan and Pennsylvania Senator Simon Cameron.Bergeron, pp. 163–164Merry, pp. 220–221 Polk eventually offered Buchanan the open seat, but Buchanan, after some indecision, turned it down. Polk subsequently nominated Robert Cooper Grier, who won confirmation.Bergeron, pp.164–166 Justice Woodbury served until his death in 1851, but Grier served until 1870. In the slavery case of Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), Grier wrote an opinion stating that slaves were property and could not sue. Polk appointed eight other federal judges, one to the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia, and seven to various United States district courts.

Foreign affairs Annexation of Texas Map of Mexico in 1845, with the Republic of Texas, the Republic of Yucatan and the disputed territory between Mexico and Texas in red. Mexico claimed to own all of Texas. The Republic of Texas had gained independence from Mexico following the Texas Revolution of 1836, and, partly because Texas had been settled by a large number of Americans, there was a strong sentiment in both Texas and the United States for the annexation of Texas by the United States. During the transition period after the 1844 election, President Tyler sought to complete the annexation of Texas. While the Senate had defeated an earlier treaty that would annex the republic, Tyler proposed that Congress accomplish annexation through a joint resolution.Merry, pg. 120-124 Due to disagreements regarding the extension of slavery, Senator Benton of Missouri and Secretary of State Calhoun disagreed on the best way to annex Texas, and Polk became involved in negotiations to break the impasse. With Polk's help, the annexation resolution narrowly cleared the Senate. In a surprise move two days before Polk's inauguration, Tyler extended to Texas a formal offer of annexation.Merry, pg. 127-128 Polk's first major decision in office was whether to recall Tyler's emissary to Texas, who bore an offer of annexation based on that act of Congress.Merry, pg. 136-137 Though it was within Polk's power to recall the messenger, he chose to allow the emissary to continue, with the hope that Texas would accept the offer. Polk also retained the United States Ambassador to Texas, Andrew Jackson Donelson, who sought to convince the Texan leaders to accept annexation under the terms proposed by the Tyler administration.Merry, pg. 148-151 Though public sentiment in Texas favored annexation, some Texas leaders disliked the strict terms for annexation, which offered little leeway for negotiation and gave public lands to the federal government.Merry, pg. 151-157 Nonetheless, in July 1845, a convention in Austin, Texas ratified the annexation of Texas.Merry, pg. 158 In December 1845, Polk signed a resolution annexing Texas, and Texas became the 28th state in the union.Merry, pp. 211–212 The annexation of Texas would lead to increased tensions with Mexico, which had never recognized Texan independence.Borneman, pp. 190–192 Partition of Oregon Country =Background= Map of Oregon Country, which the Oregon Treaty split between the Americans and British at the 49th parallel Since the signing of the Treaty of 1818, the largely unsettled Oregon Country had been under the joint occupation and control of Great Britain and the United States. Previous U.S. administrations had offered to divide the region along the 49th parallel, which was not acceptable to Britain, as it had commercial interests along the Columbia River.Merry, pp. 168–169 Britain's preferred partition, which would have awarded Puget Sound and all lands north of the Columbia River to Britain, was unacceptable to Polk. Edward Everett, President Tyler's ambassador to Great Britain, had informally proposed dividing the territory at the 49th parallel with the strategic Vancouver Island granted to the British. However, when the new British minister in Washington, Richard Pakenham, arrived in 1844, he found that many Americans desired the entire territory.Leonard, p. 95 Oregon had not been a major issue in the 1844 election, but the recent heavy influx of settlers to the Oregon Country and the rising spirit of expansionism in the United States made a treaty with Britain more urgent.Bergeron, pp. 115–116 =Partition= Though both the British and the Americans sought an acceptable compromise regarding Oregon Country, each also saw the territory as an important geopolitical asset that would play a large part in determining the dominant power in North America. In his inaugural address, Polk announced that he viewed the American claim to the land as \\"clear and unquestionable\\", provoking threats of war from British leaders should Polk attempt to take control of the entire territory.Merry, pp. 170–171 Polk had refrained in his address from asserting a claim to the entire territory, which extended north to 54 degrees, 40 minutes north latitude, although the Democratic Party platform called for such a claim.Bergeron, pp. 116–118 Despite Polk's hawkish rhetoric, he viewed war with the British as unwise, and Polk and Buchanan opened up negotiations with the British.Merry, pp. 173–175 Like his predecessors, Polk again proposed a division along the 49th parallel, which was immediately rejected by Pakenham.Merry, p. 190 Secretary of State Buchanan was wary of a two-front war with Mexico and Britain, but Polk was willing to risk war with both countries in pursuit of a favorable settlement.Merry, pp. 190–191 In his December 1845 annual message to Congress, Polk requested approval of giving Britain a one-year notice (as required in the Treaty of 1818) of his intention to terminate the joint occupancy of Oregon.Bergeron, pp. 122–123 In that message, he quoted from the Monroe Doctrine to denote America's intention of keeping European powers out, the first significant use of it since its origin in 1823.Pletcher, p. 307 After much debate, Congress eventually passed the resolution in April 1846, attaching its hope that the dispute would be settled amicably.Leonard, p. 118 When the British Foreign Secretary, Lord Aberdeen, learned of the proposal rejected by Pakenham, Aberdeen asked the United States to re-open negotiations, but Polk was unwilling to do so unless a proposal was made by the British.Merry, pp. 196–197 With Britain moving towards free trade with the repeal of the Corn Laws, good trade relations with the United States were more important to Aberdeen than a distant territory.Leonard, p. 108 In February 1846, Polk allowed Buchanan to inform Louis McLane, the American ambassador to Britain, that Polk's administration would look favorably on a British proposal based around a division at the 49th parallel.Bergeron, p. 128 In June 1846, Pakenham presented an offer to the Polk administration, calling for a boundary line at the 49th parallel, with the exception that Britain would retain all of Vancouver Island, and British subjects would be granted limited navigation rights on the Columbia River until 1859.Pletcher, pp. 407–410 Polk and most of his cabinet were prepared to accept the proposal, but Buchanan, in a reversal, urged that the United States seek control of all of the Oregon Territory.Pletcher, pp. 411–412 After winning the reluctant approval of Buchanan, Polk submitted the full treaty to the Senate for ratification. The Senate ratified the Oregon Treaty in a 41–14 vote, with opposition coming from those who sought the full territory.Bergeron, p. 133 Polk's willingness to risk war with Britain had frightened many, but his tough negotiation tactics may have gained the United States concessions from the British (particularly regarding the Columbia River) that a more conciliatory president might not have won.Merry, pp. 266–267 Mexican–American War =Background= The United States had been the first country to recognize Mexico's independence following the Mexican War of Independence, but relations between the two countries began to sour in the 1830s.Merry, pg. 184–186 In the 1830s and 1840s, the United States, like France and Britain, sought a reparations treaty with Mexico for various acts committed by Mexican citizens and authorities, including the seizure of American ships. Though the United States and Mexico had agreed to a joint board to settle the various claims prior to Polk's presidency, many Americans accused the Mexican government of acting in bad faith in settling the claims. For its part, Mexico believed that the United States sought to acquire Mexican territory, and believed that many Americans filed specious or exaggerated claims. The already-troubled Mexico–United States relations were further inflamed by the possibility of the annexation of Texas, as Mexico still viewed Texas as an integral part of their republic.Merry, pg. 176–177 Additionally, Texas laid claim to all land north of the Rio Grande River, while Mexico argued that the more northern Nueces River was the proper Texan border.Merry, pg. 187 Though the United States had a population more than twice as numerous and an economy thirteen times greater than that of Mexico, Mexico was not prepared to give up its claim to Texas, even if it meant war.Merry, pg. 180 The Mexican province of Alta California enjoyed a large degree of autonomy, and the central government neglected its defenses; a report from a French diplomat stated that \\"whatever nation chooses to send there a man-of-war and 200 men\\" could conquer California.Howe, p. 709 Polk placed great value in the acquisition of California, which represented new lands to settle as well as a potential gateway to trade in Asia.Howe, pp. 735–736 He feared that the British or another European power would eventually establish control over California if it remained in Mexican hands. In late 1845, Polk sent diplomat John Slidell to Mexico to win Mexico's acceptance of the Rio Grande border. Slidell was further authorized to purchase California for $20 million and New Mexico for $5 million.Howe, p. 734 Polk also sent Lieutenant Archibald H. Gillespie to California with orders to foment a pro- American rebellion that could be used to justify annexation of the territory.Merry, pg. 295–296 =Outbreak of war= Following the Texan ratification of annexation in 1845, both Mexicans and Americans saw war as a likely possibility. Polk began preparations for a potential war, sending an army led by General Zachary Taylor into Texas.Merry, pg. 188–189 Taylor and Commodore David Conner of the U.S. Navy were both ordered to avoid provoking a war, but were authorized to respond to any Mexican breach of peace. Though Mexican President José Joaquín de Herrera was open to negotiations, Slidell's ambassadorial credentials were refused by a Mexican council of government.Merry, pg. 209–210 In December 1845, Herrera's government collapsed largely due to his willingness to negotiate with the United States; the possibility of the sale of large portions of Mexico aroused anger among both Mexican elites and the broader populace.Merry, pg. 218–219 As successful negotiations with the unstable Mexican government appeared unlikely, Secretary of War Marcy ordered General Taylor to advance to the Rio Grande River. Polk began preparations to support a potential new government led by the exiled Mexican General Antonio López de Santa Anna with the hope that Santa Anna would sell parts of California. Polk had been advised by Alejandro Atocha, an associate of Santa Anna, that only the threat of war would allow the Mexican government the leeway to sell parts of Mexico.Merry, pg. 238–240 In March 1846, Slidell finally left Mexico after the government refused his demand to be formally received.Merry, pg. 232–233 Slidell returned to Washington in May 1846, and gave his opinion that negotiations with the Mexican government were unlikely to be successful. Polk regarded the treatment of his diplomat as an insult and an \\"ample cause of war\\", and he prepared to ask Congress for a declaration of war.Haynes, p. 129 Meanwhile, in late March 1846, General Taylor reached the Rio Grande, and his army camped across the river from Matamoros, Tamaulipas. In April, after Mexican general Pedro de Ampudia demanded that Taylor return to the Nueces River, Taylor began a blockade of Matamoros.Merry, pg. 240-242 A skirmish on the northern side of the Rio Grande ended in the death or capture of dozens of American soldiers, and became known as the Thornton Affair. While the administration was in the process of asking for a declaration of war, Polk received word of the outbreak of hostilities on the Rio Grande. In a message to Congress, Polk explained his decision to send Taylor to the Rio Grande, and stated that Mexico had invaded American territory by crossing the river.Merry, pg. 244–245 Polk contended that a state of war already existed, and he asked Congress to grant him the power to bring the war to a close. Polk's message was crafted to present the war as a just and necessary defense of the country against a neighbor that had long troubled the United States.Lee, pgs. 517–518 In his message, Polk noted that Slidell had gone to Mexico to negotiate a recognition of the Texas annexation, but did not mention that he also sought the purchase of California. Some Whigs, such as Abraham Lincoln, challenged Polk's version of events.Mark E. Neely, Jr., \\"War And Partisanship: What Lincoln Learned from James K. Polk,\\" Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society, Sept 1981, Vol. 74 Issue 3, pp 199–216 One Whig congressman declared \\"the river Nueces is the true western boundary of Texas. It is our own president who began this war. He has been carrying it on for months.\\"Howe, pp. 741–742 Nonetheless, the House overwhelmingly approved of a resolution authorizing the president to call up fifty thousand volunteers.Merry, pg. 245–246 In the Senate, war opponents led by Calhoun also questioned Polk's version of events, but the House resolution passed the Senate in a 40-2 vote, marking the beginning of the Mexican–American War.Merry, pg. 246–247 Many congressmen who were skeptical about the wisdom of going to war with Mexico feared that publicly opposing the war would cost them politically.In January 1848, the Whigs won a House vote attacking Polk in an amendment to a resolution praising Major General Taylor for his service in a \\"war unnecessarily and unconstitutionally begun by the President of the United States\\". House Journal, 30th Session (1848) pp.183–184 The resolution, however, died in committee. =Early war= Overview map of the war. Key: In May 1846, Taylor led U.S. forces in the inconclusive Battle of Palo Alto, the first major battle of the war. The next day, Taylor led the army to victory in the Battle of Resaca de la Palma, eliminating the possibility of a Mexican incursion into the United States. Taylor's force moved south towards Monterrey, which served as the capital of the province of Nuevo León.Howe, pp. 772–773 In the September 1846 Battle of Monterrey, Taylor defeated a Mexican force led by Ampudia, but allowed Ampudia's forces to withdraw, much to Polk's consternation.Merry, pg. 311-313 Meanwhile, Winfield Scott, the army's lone major general at the outbreak of the war, was offered the position of top commander in the war. Polk, War Secretary Marcy, and Scott agreed on a strategy in which the US would capture northern Mexico and then pursue a favorable peace settlement.Merry, pg. 256-257 However, Polk and Scott experienced mutual distrust from the beginning of their relationship, in part due to Scott's Whig affiliation and former rivalry with Andrew Jackson.Merry, pg. 253-254 Additionally, Polk sought to ensure that both Whigs and Democrats would serve in important positions in the war, and was offended when Scott suggested otherwise; Scott also angered Polk by opposing Polk's effort to increase the number of generals.Merry, pg. 258-259 Having been alienated from Scott, Polk ordered Scott to remain in Washington, leaving Taylor in command of Mexican operations.Merry, pg. 259-260 Polk also ordered Commodore Conner to allow Santa Anna to return to Mexico from his exile, and sent an army expedition led by Stephen W. Kearny towards Santa Fe.Merry, pg. 262 While Taylor fought the Mexican army in east, U.S. forces took control of California and New Mexico.Howe, pp. 752–762 Army Captain John C. Frémont led settlers in Northern California in an attack on the Mexican garrison in Sonoma, beginning the Bear Flag Revolt.Merry, pg. 302-304 In August 1846, American forces under Kearny captured Santa Fe, capital of the province of New Mexico.Merry, pg. 293-294 He captured Santa Fe without firing a shot, as the Mexican Governor, Manuel Armijo, fled from the province.Merry, pg. 298-299 After establishing a provisional government in New Mexico, Kearny took a force west to aid in the conquest of California. After Kearny's departure, Mexicans and Puebloans rebelled against the provisional government in the Taos Revolt, but U.S. forces crushed the uprising.Howe, pp. 760–762 At roughly the same time that Kearny captured Santa Fe, Commodore Robert F. Stockton landed in Los Angeles and proclaimed the capture of California. Californios rose up in rebellion against U.S. occupation, but Stockton and Kearny suppressed the revolt with a victory in the Battle of La Mesa. After the battle, Kearny and Frémont became embroiled in a dispute over the establishment of a government in California.Howe, pp. 756–757 The controversy between Frémont and Kearny led to a break between Polk and the powerful Missouri Senator Thomas Hart Benton, who was the father-in-law of Frémont.Merry, pg. 423-424 =Growing domestic resistance= Whig opposition to the war grew after 1845, while some Democrats lost their initial enthusiasm.Howe, pp. 762–766 In August 1846, Polk asked Congress to appropriate $2 million in hopes of using that money as a down payment for the purchase of California in a treaty with Mexico.Merry, pg. 283-285 Polk's request ignited opposition to the war, as Polk had never before made public his desire to annex parts of Mexico (aside from lands claimed by Texas). A freshman Democratic Congressman, David Wilmot of Pennsylvania, offered an amendment known as the Wilmot Proviso that would ban slavery in any newly acquired lands.Merry, pg. 286-289 The appropriations bill, including the Wilmot Proviso, passed the House with the support Northern Whigs and Northern Democrats, breaking the normal pattern of partisan division in congressional votes. Wilmot himself held anti-slavery views, but many pro-slavery Northern Democrats voted for the bill out of anger at Polk's perceived bias towards the South. The partition of Oregon, the debate over the tariff, and Van Buren's antagonism towards Polk all contributed to Northern anger. The appropriations bill, including the ban on slavery, was defeated in the Senate, but the Wilmot Proviso injected the slavery debate into national politics.McPherson, pp. 53-54 Polk's Democrats would pay a price for the resistance to the war and the growing issue of slavery, as Democrats lost control of the House in the 1846 elections. However, in early 1847, Polk was successful in passing a bill raising further regiments, and he also finally won approval for the money he wanted to use for the purchase of California.Merry, pg. 343-349 =Late war= Santa Anna returned to Mexico City in September 1846, declaring that he would fight against the Americans.Merry, pg. 309-310 With the duplicity of Santa Anna now clear, and with the Mexicans declining his peace offers, Polk ordered an American landing in Veracruz, the most important Mexican port on the Gulf of Mexico. As a march from Monterrey to Mexico City was implausible due to rough terrain,Merry, pg. 314 Polk had decided that a force would land in Veracruz and then march on Mexico City.Merry, pg. 336 Taylor was ordered to remain near Monterrey, while Polk reluctantly chose Winfield Scott to lead the attack on Veracruz.Merry, pg. 318-20 Though Polk continued to distrust Scott, Marcy and the other cabinet members prevailed on Polk to select the army's most senior general for the command.Seigenthaler, pg. 139-140 In March 1847, Polk learned that Taylor had ignored orders and had continued to march south, capturing the northern Mexican town of Saltillo.Merry, pg. 352-355 Taylor's army had repulsed a larger Mexican force, led by Santa Anna, in the February 1847 Battle of Buena Vista. Taylor won acclaim for the result of the battle, but the theater remained inconclusive. Rather than pursuing Santa Anna's forces, Taylor withdrew back to Monterrey.Howe, pp. 777–778 Meanwhile, Scott landed in Veracruz and quickly won control of the city.Merry, pg. 358-359 Following the capture of Veracruz, Polk dispatched Nicholas Trist, Buchanan's chief clerk, to negotiate a peace treaty with Mexican leaders. Trist was ordered to seek the cession of Alta California, New Mexico, and Baja California, recognition of the Rio Grande as the southern border of Texas, and American access across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.Merry, pg. 360–361 In April 1847, Scott defeated a Mexican force led by Santa Anna at the Battle of Cerro Gordo, clearing the way for a march on Mexico City.Merry, pg. 363–364 In August, Scott defeated Santa Anna again at the Battle of Contreras and the Battle of Churubusco.Merry, pg. 381–382 With these victories over a larger force, Scott's army was positioned to besiege Mexico's capital. Santa Anna negotiated a truce with Scott, and the Mexican foreign minister notified Trist that they were ready to begin negotiations to end the war.Merry, pg. 383–384 However, the Mexican and American delegations remained far apart on terms; Mexico was only willing to yield portions of Alta California, and still refused to agree to the Rio Grande border.Merry, pg. 384–385 While negotiations continued, Scott captured the Mexican capital in the Battle for Mexico City.Merry, pg. 387–388 In the United States, a heated political debate emerged regarding how much of Mexico the United States should seek to annex, with Whigs such as Henry Clay arguing that the United States should only seek to settle the Texas border question, and some expansionists arguing for the annexation of all of Mexico.Merry, pg. 394–397 Frustrated by the lack of progress in negotiations, and troubled by rumors that Trist was willing to negotiate on the Rio Grande border, Polk ordered Trist to return to Washington.Merry, pg. 386 Polk decided to occupy large portions of Mexico and wait for a Mexican peace offer.Merry, pg. 403–404 In late 1847, Polk learned that Scott had court-martialed a close ally of Polk's, Gideon Johnson Pillow.Merry, pg. 407–409 Outraged by that event, Polk demanded Scott's return to Washington, with William Orlando Butler tapped as his replacement. =Peace: the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo= The Mexican Cession (in red) was acquired through the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The Gadsden Purchase (in orange) was acquired through purchase after Polk left office. In September 1847, Manuel de la Peña y Peña replaced Santa Anna as President of Mexico, and Pena and his Moderado allies showed a willingness to negotiate based on the terms Polk had relayed to Trist.Merry, pg. 397-400 In November 1847, Trist received Polk's order to return to Washington. After a period of indecision, and with the backing of Scott and the Mexican government (which was aware that Polk had ordered Trist's recall), Trist decided to enter into negotiations with the Mexican government. As Polk had made no plans to send an envoy to replace him, Trist thought that he could not pass up the opportunity to end the war on favorable terms. Though Polk was outraged by Trist's decision, he decided to allow Trist some time to negotiate a treaty.Merry, pg. 420–421 Throughout January 1848, Trist regularly met with Mexican officials in Guadalupe Hidalgo, a small town north of Mexico City.Merry, pg. 424–425 Trist was willing to allow Mexico to keep Lower California, but successfully haggled for the inclusion of the important harbor of San Diego in a cession of Upper California. The Mexican delegation agreed to recognize the Rio Grande border, while Trist agreed to have the United States cover prior American claims against the Mexican government. The two sides also agreed to the right of Mexicans in annexed territory to leave or become U.S. citizens, American responsibility to prevent cross-border Indian raids, protection of church property, and a $15 million payment to Mexico. On February 2, 1848, Trist and the Mexican delegation signed the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Polk received the document on February 19,Borneman, pp. 308–309Pletcher, p. 517 and, after the Cabinet met on the 20th, decided he had no choice but to accept it. If he turned it down, with the House by then controlled by the Whigs, there was no assurance Congress would vote funding to continue the war. Both Buchanan and Walker dissented, wanting more land from Mexico.Greenberg, pp. 260–261 Some senators opposed the treaty because they wanted to take no Mexican territory; others hesitated because of the irregular nature of Trist's negotiations. Polk waited in suspense for two weeks as the Senate considered it, sometimes hearing that it would likely be defeated, and that Buchanan and Walker were working against it. On March 10, the Senate ratified the treaty in a 38–14 vote that cut across partisan and geographic lines.Bergeron, pp. 104–105 The Senate made some modifications to treaty, and Polk worried that the Mexican government would reject the new terms. Despite those fears, on June 7, Polk learned that Mexico had ratified the treaty.Merry, pp. 448–450 Polk declared the treaty in effect as of July 4, 1848, thus ending the war.Leonard, p. 180 The Mexican Cession added 600,000 square miles of territory to the United States, including a long Pacific coastline. The treaty also recognized the annexation of Texas and acknowledged American control over the disputed territory between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande. Mexico, in turn, received $15 million. The war had cost the lives of nearly 14,000 Americans and 25,000 Mexicans, and had cost the United States roughly one hundred million dollars.Rough estimate of total cost, Smith, II 266–67; this includes the payments to Mexico in exchange for the ceded territories. The excess military appropriations during the war itself were $63,605,621. With the exception of the territory acquired by the 1853 Gadsden Purchase, the territorial acquisitions under Polk established the modern borders of the Contiguous United States. =Postwar and the territories= United States states and territories when Polk entered office United States states and territories when Polk left office Polk had been anxious to establish a territorial government for Oregon once the treaty was effective in 1846, but the matter became embroiled in the arguments over slavery, though few thought Oregon suitable for that institution. A bill to establish an Oregon territorial government passed the House after being amended to bar slavery; the bill died in the Senate when opponents ran out the clock on the congressional session. A resurrected bill, still barring slavery, again passed the House in January 1847, but it was not considered by the Senate before Congress adjourned in March. By the time Congress met again in December, California and New Mexico were in U.S. hands, and Polk in his annual message urged the establishment of territorial governments in California, New Mexico, and Oregon.Bergeron, pp. 202–205 The Missouri Compromise had settled the issue of the geographic reach of slavery within the Louisiana Purchase territories by prohibiting slavery in states north of 36°30′ latitude, but Polk sought to extend this line into the newly acquired territory.Merry, pp. 452–453 If extended to the Pacific, this would have made slavery illegal in Northern California, but would have allowed it in Southern California.Dusinberre, p. 143 A plan to accomplish the extension was defeated in the House by a bipartisan alliance of Northerners.Merry, pp. 458–459 As the last congressional session before the 1848 election came to a close, Polk signed the lone territorial bill passed by Congress, which established the Territory of Oregon and prohibited slavery in it.Merry, pp. 460–461 When Congress reconvened in December 1848, Polk again called for the establishment territorial governments in California and New Mexico, a task made especially urgent by the onset of the California Gold Rush.Bergeron, p. 208 However, the divisive issue of slavery blocked any such legislation. Polk made it clear that he would veto a territorial bill that would have had the laws Mexico apply to the southwest territories until Congress, considering it to be the Wilmot Proviso in another guise. It was not until the Compromise of 1850 that the matter of the territories was resolved.Bergeron, pp. 210–211 Other initiatives Polk's ambassador to the Republic of New Granada, Benjamin Alden Bidlack, negotiated the Mallarino–Bidlack Treaty with the government of New Granada. Though Bidlack had initially only sought to remove tariffs on American goods, Bidlack and New Granadan Foreign Minister Manuel María Mallarino negotiated a broader agreement that deepened military and trade ties between the two countries. The treaty also allowed for the construction of the Panama Railway. In an era of slow overland travel, the treaty gave the United States a route to more rapidly travel between its eastern and western coasts. In exchange, Bidlack agreed to have the United States guarantee New Granada's sovereignty over the Isthmus of Panama. The treaty won ratification in both countries in 1848. The agreement helped to establish a stronger American influence in the region, as the Polk administration sought to ensure that Great Britain would not dominate Central America. The United States would use the Mallarino-Bidlack Treaty as justification for numerous military interventions in the 19th century. In mid-1848, President Polk authorized his ambassador to Spain, Romulus Mitchell Saunders, to negotiate the purchase of Cuba and offer Spain up to $100 million, an astounding sum at the time for one territory, equal to $ in present-day terms. Cuba was close to the United States and had slavery, so the idea appealed to Southerners but was unwelcome in the North. However, Spain was still making huge profits in Cuba (notably in sugar, molasses, rum, and tobacco), and thus the Spanish government rejected Saunders' overtures.David M. Pletcher, The Diplomacy of Annexation: Texas, Oregon, and the Mexican War (1973) pp. 571–74. Though Polk was eager to acquire Cuba, he refused to support the proposed filibuster expedition of Narciso López, who sought to invade and annex Cuba. Domestic affairs Polk (1849) Tariff reduction The Tariff of 1842 had set relatively high tariff rates, and Polk made a reduction of tariff rates the top priority of his domestic agenda.Bergeron, pp. 185–186 Though he had taken an ambivalent position on the tariff during the 1844 campaign in order to win Northern votes, Polk had long opposed a high tariff.Seigenthaler, pp. 113-114 Many Americans, especially in the North, favored high tariffs as a means of protecting domestic manufacturing from foreign competition. Polk believed that protective tariffs were unfair to other economic activities, and he favored reducing tariff rates to the minimum level necessary for funding the federal government. Upon taking office, Polk directed Secretary of the Treasury Walker to draft a law that would lower tariff rates. Though foreign policy and other issues prevented Congress and the administration from focusing on tariff reduction in 1845 and early 1846, Walker worked with Congressman James Iver McKay to develop a tariff reduction bill. In April 1846, McKay reported the bill out of the House Ways and Means Committee for consideration by the full House of Representatives.Bergeron, pp. 186–188 After intense lobbying by both sides, the bill passed the House on July 3, with the vast majority of favorable votes coming from Democrats.Bergeron, pp. 187–189 Consideration then moved to the Senate, and Polk intensely lobbied a group of wavering senators to assure passage of the bill.Bergeron, pp. 189–190 In a close vote that required Vice President Dallas to break a tie, the Senate approved the tariff bill in July 1846.Seigenthaler, pp. 115–116 Dallas, from protectionist Pennsylvania, voted for the bill because he decided that his best political prospects lay in supporting the administration.Pletcher, p. 419 Following the congressional passage of the bill, Polk signed the Walker Tariff into law, substantially reducing the rates that had been set by the Tariff of 1842. The Walker Tariff would remain in place until the passage of the Tariff of 1857, staying in effect longer than any other tariff measure of the nineteenth century.Bergeron, p. 186 The reduction of tariffs in the United States and the repeal of the Corn Laws in Great Britain led to a boom in Anglo-American trade and, in large part due to growing international trade, the economy entered a strong period of growth in the late 1840s.Howe, p. 829 Banking policy In his inaugural address, Polk called upon Congress to re-establish the Independent Treasury System under which government funds were held in the Treasury and not in banks or other financial institutions.Merry, pg. 206-207 Under that system, the government would store federal funds in vaults in the Treasury Building and other government buildings, where those funds would remain until they were used to fund the government.Bergeron, p. 192 President Van Buren had previously established the Independent Treasury system, but it had been abolished during the Tyler administration.Seigenthaler, pp. 121–122 Under the status quo that prevailed when Polk took office, the government deposited its funds in state banks, which could then use those funds in ordinary banking operations. Polk believed that this policy resulted in inflation, and was also philosophically opposed to involving the government in banking.Bergeron, pp. 191–192 The Whigs had wanted to create a new national bank since the expiration of the charter of the Second Bank of the United States in 1836, but their efforts had been vetoed by President Tyler, and Polk strongly opposed the re-establishment of a national bank. In a party-line vote, the House of Representatives approved Polk's Independent Treasury bill in April 1846. After personally winning the support of Senator Dixon Lewis, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Polk was able to push the Independent Treasury Act through the Senate, and he signed the act into law on August 6, 1846. The system would remain in place until the passage of the Federal Reserve Act in 1913.Merry, pg. 276-277 Opposition to internal improvements bills During Polk's presidency, Congress passed bills to provide federal funding for internal improvements such as roads, canals, and harbors. Those who favored such funding, many of whom were Whigs, believed that internal improvements aided economic development and Western settlement. Unlike tariffs and monetary policy, support for federally-funded internal improvements split the Democratic Party, and a coalition of Democrats and Whigs arranged for the passage of internal improvement bills despite Polk's opposition.Bergeron, pp. 193–195 Polk considered internal improvements to be matters for the states, and feared that the passage of federal internal improvements bill would encourage legislators to compete for favors for their home district; Polk felt that such competition for federal resources damaged the virtue of the republic. When Congress passed the Rivers and Harbors Bill in 1846 to provide $500,000 to improve port facilities, Polk vetoed it. Polk believed that the bill was unconstitutional because it unfairly favored particular areas, including ports that had no foreign trade.Yonatan Eyal, The Young America movement and the Transformation of the Democratic Party (2007) p. 63 In this regard he followed his hero Jackson, who had vetoed the Maysville Road Bill in 1830 on similar grounds.Mark Eaton Byrnes, James K. Polk: a biographical companion (2001) p. 44 In 1847, Polk pocket vetoed another internal improvements bill, and Congress would not pass a similar bill during his presidency.Bergeron, pp. 196–200 Other domestic issues =Slavery= Like Jackson, Polk saw slavery as a side issue compared to other matters such as territorial expansion and economic policy.Merry, pg. 129-130 However, the issue of slavery became increasingly polarizing during the 1840s, and Polk's expansionary policies increased its divisiveness. During his presidency, many abolitionists harshly criticized him as an instrument of the \\"Slave Power\\", and claimed that he supported western expansion because he wanted to extend slavery into new territories.Haynes, p. 154 For his part, Polk accused both northern and southern leaders of attempting to use the slavery issue for political gain.Merry, pg. 356-358 The divisive debate over slavery in the territories led to the creation of the Free Soil Party, an anti-slavery (though not abolitionist) party that attracted Democrats, Whigs, and members of the Liberty Party.Bergeron, pp. 206–207 =California Gold Rush= The California Gold Rush began under Polk. Authoritative word of the discovery of gold in California did not arrive in Washington until after the 1848 election, by which time Polk was a lame duck. Polk was delighted by the discovery of gold, seeing it as validation of his stance on expansion, and he referred to the discovery several times in his final annual message to Congress that December. Shortly thereafter, actual samples of the California gold arrived, and Polk sent a special message to Congress on the subject. The message, confirming less authoritative reports, caused large numbers of people to move to California, both from the U.S. and abroad, thus helping to spark the California Gold Rush.Woodworth, pp. 319–321 The California gold rush injected large quantities of gold into the U.S. economy, helping to ease a long-term shortage of gold coins. In large because of this gold, the Whigs were unable to whip up popular enthusiasm for a revival of the national bank after Polk left office.Howe, pp. 815–816 =Department of the Interior= One of Polk's last acts as president was to sign the bill creating the Department of the Interior (March 3, 1849). This was the first new cabinet position created since the early days of the Republic. Polk had misgivings about the federal government usurping power over public lands from the states. Nevertheless, the delivery of the legislation on his last full day in office gave him no time to find constitutional grounds for a veto, or to draft a sufficient veto message, so he signed the bill.Borneman, pp. 334–45 =States admitted to the Union= Three states were admitted to the Union during Polk's presidency: * TexasDecember 29, 1845 * IowaDecember 28, 1846 * WisconsinMay 29, 1848 1848 election Results of the 1848 Presidential election Honoring his pledge to serve only one term, Polk declined to seek re- election in 1848. With Polk out of the race, the Democratic Party remained fractured along geographic lines.Merry, pg. 376-377 Polk privately favored Lewis Cass as his successor, but resisted becoming closely involved in the election.Merry, pp. 430–431 At the 1848 Democratic National Convention, Buchanan, Cass, and Supreme Court Justice Levi Woodbury emerged as the main contenders.Merry, pg. 446-447 Cass drew support from both the North and South with his doctrine of popular sovereignty, under which each territory would decide the legal status of slavery.McPherson, p. 58 Cass led after the first ballot, and slowly gained support until he clinched the nomination on the fourth ballot. William Butler, who had replaced Winfield Scott as the commanding general in Mexico City, won the vice presidential nomination. Cass's nomination alienated many northerners and southerners, each of whom saw Cass as insufficiently committed to their position on the slavery issue. During the course of the Mexican War, Generals Taylor and Scott emerged as strong Whig candidates.Merry, pg. 374-375 As the war continued, Taylor's stature with the public grew, and he announced in 1847 that he would not refuse the presidency. The 1848 Whig National Convention took place on June 8, with Taylor, Scott, Henry Clay, and Massachusetts Senator Daniel Webster emerging as the major candidates.Merry, pg. 447-448 Taylor narrowly led Clay after the first ballot, and his support steadily grew until he captured the nomination on the fourth ballot. Clay bemoaned the selection of the ideologically ambiguous Taylor, who had not articulated his preferred policies on the major issues of the day. The Whigs chose former Congressman Millard Fillmore of New York as Taylor's running mate. In New York, an anti-slavery Democratic faction known as the Barnburners strongly supported the Wilmot Proviso and rejected Cass.Merry, pg. 455-456 Joined by other anti-slavery Democrats from other states, the Barnburners held a convention nominating former President Martin Van Buren as their own presidential nominee, and Van Buren eventually became the Free Soil Party's nominee. Though Van Buren had not been known for his anti-slavery views while president, he embraced them in 1848. Van Buren's decision to run was also affected by Polk's decision to give patronage to rival factions in New York.Howe, p. 832 Polk was surprised and disappointed by his former ally's political conversion, and he worried about the divisiveness of a sectional party organized around anti-slavery principles. Van Buren was joined on the Free Soil Party's ticket by Charles Francis Adams Sr., son of former President and prominent Whig John Quincy Adams.Bergeron, pp. 252–253 In the election, Taylor won 47.3% of the popular vote and a majority of the electoral vote, giving the Whigs control of the presidency. Cass won 42.5% of the vote, while Van Buren finished with 10.1% of the popular vote, more than any other third party presidential candidate at that time. Despite the increasingly polarizing slavery debate, Taylor and Cass both won a mix of northern and southern states, while most of Van Buren's support came from northern Democrats.Merry, pg. 462-463 Polk was very disappointed by the outcome as he had a low opinion of Taylor, seeing the general as someone with poor judgment and few opinions. Polk left office in March 1849, and he died the following June.Bergeron, pp. 256–260 Historical reputation A statue of James Knox Polk at the North Carolina State Capitol Polk's historic reputation was largely formed by the attacks made on him in his own time. Whig politicians claimed that he was drawn from a well-deserved obscurity. Sam Houston is said to have observed that Polk was \\"a victim of the use of water as a beverage\\".Borneman, p. 11. Senator Tom Corwin of Ohio remarked \\"James K. Polk, of Tennessee? After that, who is safe?\\" The Republican historians of the nineteenth century inherited this view. Polk was a compromise between the Democrats of the North, like David Wilmot and Silas Wright, and Southern plantation owners led by John C. Calhoun. The Northern Democrats thought that when they did not get their way, it was because he was the tool of the slaveholders, and the conservatives of the South insisted that he was the tool of the Northern Democrats. These views were long reflected in the historical literature, until Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. and Bernard De Voto argued that Polk was nobody's tool, but set his own goals and achieved them.Schlesinger, pp.439–455; quote from Corwin (who became a Republican) on p. 439 Polls of historians and political scientists have generally ranked Polk as an above-average president, and Polk tends to rank higher than every other president who served between the presidencies of Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln. A 2018 poll of the American Political Science Association’s Presidents and Executive Politics section ranked Polk as the 21st best president. A 2017 C-Span poll of historians ranked Polk as the 14th best president. Polk biographers over the years have sized up the magnitude of Polk's achievements and his legacy, particularly his two most recent. \\"There are three key reasons why James K. Polk deserves recognition as a significant and influential American president,\\" Walter Borneman wrote. \\"First, Polk accomplished the objectives of his presidential term as he defined them; second, he was the most decisive chief executive before the Civil War; and third, he greatly expanded the executive power of the presidency, particularly its war powers, its role as commander-in-chief, and its oversight of the executive branch.\\"Borneman, p. 353. Political scientist Leonard White summed up Polk's command system: :He determined the general strategy of military and naval operations; he chose commanding officers; he gave personal attention to supply problems; he energized so far as he could the General Staff; he controlled the military and naval estimates; and he used the cabinet as a major coordinating agency for the conduct of the campaign.White, Leonard D. The Jacksonians: A Study in Administrative History, 1829-1861 (1954) p. 54. While Polk's legacy thus takes many forms, the most outstanding is the map of the continental United States, whose landmass he increased by a third. \\"To look at that map,\\" Robert Merry concluded, \\"and to take in the western and southwestern expanse included in it, is to see the magnitude of Polk's presidential accomplishments.\\" Though there were powerful forces compelling Americans to the Pacific Ocean, some historians, such as Gary Kornblith, have posited that a Clay presidency would have seen the permanent independence of Texas and California. Nevertheless, Polk's aggressive expansionism has been criticized on ethical grounds. He believed in \\"Manifest Destiny\\" even more than most did. Referencing the Mexican–American War, ex-president Ulysses S. Grant stated that \\"I was bitterly opposed to the [Texas annexation], and to this day regard the war, which resulted, as one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation. It was an instance of a republic following the bad example of European monarchies, in not considering justice in their desire to acquire additional territory.\\"Ulysses S Grant Quotes on the Military Academy and the Mexican War from Fadedgiant.net Whig politicians, including Abraham Lincoln and John Quincy Adams, contended that the Texas Annexation and the Mexican Cession enhanced the pro-slavery factions of the United States.Stephenson, Nathaniel Wright. Texas and the Mexican War: A Chronicle of Winning the Southwest. Yale University Press (1921), pg. 94–95. Unsatisfactory conditions pertaining to the status of slavery in the territories acquired during the Polk administration led to the Compromise of 1850, one of the primary factors in the establishment of the Republican Party and later the beginning of the American Civil War.Holt, Michael F.

Fillmore had been Vice President of the United States for when he became the 13th United States president. Fillmore was the second president to succeed to the office without being elected to it, after John Tyler, as well as the last Whig president. Fillmore was succeeded by Democrat Franklin Pierce. Upon taking office, Fillmore dismissed Taylor's cabinet and pursued a new policy with regards to the territory acquired in the Mexican–American War. He supported the efforts of Senators Henry Clay and Stephen A. Douglas, who crafted and passed the Compromise of 1850. The Compromise of 1850 temporarily settled the status of slavery in the lands acquired as result of the Mexican–American War, and led to a brief truce in the political battle between slave and free states. A controversial part of the Compromise was the Fugitive Slave Act, which expedited the return of escaped slaves to those who claimed ownership. Fillmore felt himself duty- bound to enforce it, but his support of the policy damaged his popularity and split both the Whig Party and the nation. In foreign policy, Fillmore launched the Perry Expedition to open trade in Japan, moved to block the French annexation of Hawaii, and avoided war with Spain in the aftermath of Narciso López's filibuster expeditions to Cuba. Fillmore somewhat reluctantly sought his party's nomination for a full term, but the split between supporters of Fillmore and Secretary of State Daniel Webster led to the nomination of General Winfield Scott at the 1852 Whig National Convention. Pierce defeated Scott by a wide margin in the general election. Though some analysts praise various aspects of his presidency, Fillmore is generally ranked as a below average president in polls of historians and political scientists.  Accession  The 1848 Whig National Convention selected Zachary Taylor, a top American general during the Mexican–American War, as the Whig presidential nominee. For Taylor's running mate, John A. Collier convinced his fellow Whig's to nominate Fillmore, a loyal supporter of defeated presidential candidate Henry Clay. During the 1848 presidential election, Fillmore campaigned for the Whig ticket, and he helped put an end to a brief anti- Taylor movement among Northern Whigs that had emerged after Taylor accepted the nomination of a small, breakaway group of pro-slavery Democrats. With the Democrats divided by the Free Soil candidacy of former President Martin Van Buren, the Whigs won the 1848 presidential election. Despite the Whig presidential victory, Democrats maintained control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, preventing the reversal of outgoing President James K. Polk's policies on the tariff and other issues. Taylor's presidency instead centered the status of slavery in the region ceded by Mexico following the Mexican–American War. After taking office, Vice President Fillmore was quickly sidelined by the efforts of editor Thurlow Weed, who viewed Fillmore as a rival to Weed's close political ally, William H. Seward. Fillmore was unhappy during his vice presidency, partly because his wife, Abigail Fillmore, spent much of her time at their home in New York. Fillmore received the formal notification of Zachary Taylor's death, signed by the cabinet, on the evening of July 9, 1850 in his residence at the Willard Hotel. Fillmore had spent the previous night in a vigil with the cabinet outside of Taylor's White House bedroom. After acknowledging the letter, Fillmore went to the House of Representatives Chamber in the U.S. Capitol, where he took the presidential oath of office. William Cranch, chief judge of the U.S. Circuit Court, administered the oath to Fillmore. In contrast to John Tyler, whose legitimacy as president had been questioned by many after his accession to the presidency in 1841, Fillmore was widely accepted as the president by members of Congress and the public. Taylor's widow, Margaret Taylor, left Washington soon after her husband's death, and Fillmore's family took up residence in the White House shortly thereafter. Because Fillmore's wife, Abigail, was often in poor health, his daughter, Mary Abigail Fillmore, frequently served as the White House hostess.  Administration  Taylor's cabinet appointees submitted their resignation on July 10, and Fillmore accepted the resignations the following day. Fillmore is the only president who succeeded by death or resignation not to retain, at least initially, his predecessor's cabinet. The biggest challenge facing Taylor had been the issue of slavery in the territories, and this issue immediately confronted the Fillmore administration as well. Taylor had opposed a plan, formulated by Henry Clay, which was designed to appeal to both anti-slavery northerners and pro-slavery southerners, but which received the most support from Southerners. During his vice presidency, Fillmore had indicated that he might vote to support the compromise, but he had not publicly committed himself on the issue when he assumed the presidency. Fillmore hoped to use the process of selecting the cabinet to re-unify the Whig Party, and he sought to balance the cabinet among North and South, pro-compromise and anti-compromise, and pro-Taylor and anti- Taylor. Fillmore offered the position of Secretary of State to Robert Charles Winthrop, an anti-compromise Massachusetts Whig who was widely popular among Whigs in the House of Representatives, but Winthrop declined the post. Fillmore instead chose Daniel Webster, who had previously served as Secretary of State under William Henry Harrison and John Tyler. Webster had outraged his Massachusetts constituents by supporting the compromise, and he was unlikely to win election another term in the Senate in 1851. Webster became Fillmore's most important adviser. Two other prominent Whig Senators, Thomas Corwin of Ohio and John J. Crittenden of Kentucky, also joined Fillmore's cabinet. Fillmore appointed his old law partner, Nathan Hall, as Postmaster General, a cabinet position that controlled many patronage appointments. Charles Magill Conrad of Louisiana became the Secretary of War, William Alexander Graham of North Carolina became Secretary of the Navy, and Alexander Hugh Holmes Stuart of Virginia became Secretary of the Interior. Though Fillmore's cabinet appointments were warmly received by both Northern and Southern Whigs, party unity was shattered soon after Fillmore's accession due to the fight over Clay's compromise.  Judicial appointments  Fillmore appointed one Supreme Court justice, though two Supreme Court vacancies arose during his presidency. The first vacancy arose due to the death of Associate Justice Levi Woodbury in 1851. Determined to nominate a Whig from New England, Fillmore settled on Benjamin Robbins Curtis. The 41-year-old Curtis had earned notoriety as a leading practitioner of commercial law, and he won the full backing of Secretary of State Webster. Despite some opposition from anti-slavery senators, Curtis ultimately won Senate approval. After the death of Associate Justice John McKinley in mid-1852, Fillmore successively nominated Edward A. Bradford, George Edmund Badger, and William C. Micou. By refusing to act on any of the nominations, Senate Democrats ensured that the vacancy would be filled by Franklin Pierce after Fillmore left office. Curtis would serve on the Supreme Court until 1857, when he resigned in protest of the holding in Dred Scott v. Sandford. Fillmore also made four appointments to United States District Courts, including that of his Postmaster General, Nathan Hall, to the federal district court in Buffalo. searches run from page, \\"select research categories\\" then check \\"court type\\" and \\"nominating president\\", then select U.S. District Courts (or U.S. Circuit Courts) and also Millard Fillmore.  Domestic affairs   Compromise of 1850  = Background = The slave states and free states in 1846, before the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and the partition of Oregon. Before and during Taylor's presidency, a crisis had developed over the land acquired after the Mexican–American War in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The key issue was the status of slavery in the territories, which, for many leaders, represented a debate over not just slavery but also morality, property rights, and personal honor. Southern extremists like John C. Calhoun viewed any limit on slavery as an attack on the Southern way of life, while many Northerners opposed any further expansion of slavery. Further complicating the issue was the fact that much of the newly-acquired Western lands seemed unsuitable to slavery due to climate and geography. In 1820, Congress had agreed to the Missouri Compromise, which had banned slavery in all lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36° 30' parallel, and many Southerners sought to extend this line to the Pacific Ocean. During the Mexican–American War, a Northern member of Congress had put forth the Wilmot Proviso, a legislative proposal that would have banned slavery in all territories acquired in the Mexican–American War. Though not adopted by Congress, the debate over the Wilmot Proviso had contributed to an increasingly tense national debate regarding slavery. The territorial issues centered on the territories of California and New Mexico, as well the state of Texas, which had been annexed in 1845. Because California lacked an organized territorial government, the federal government faced difficulties in providing adequate governance in the midst of the California Gold Rush, and many sought immediate statehood for California. After the start of the gold rush, hundreds of slaves were imported into California to work the gold mines, provoking a harsh reaction from competing miners. With the approval of military governor Bennet C. Riley, in 1849 Californians held a constitutional convention. In anticipation of imminent statehood, the convention wrote a new constitution that would ban slavery in California. Meanwhile, Texas claimed all of the Mexican Cession east of the Rio Grande, including parts of the former Mexican state of New Mexico that it had never exercised de facto control over. Texan leaders had expected to be granted control of all territory east of the Rio Grande after the Mexican-American War, but the inhabitants of New Mexico had resisted Texan control. New Mexico had long prohibited slavery, a fact that affected the debate over its territorial status, but many New Mexican leaders opposed joining Texas primarily because Texas's capital lay hundreds of miles away and because Texas and New Mexico had a history of conflict dating back to the 1841 Santa Fe Expedition. Outside of Texas, many Southern leaders supported Texas's claims to New Mexico in order to secure as much territory as possible for the expansion of slavery. President Taylor had opposed Texas's ambitions in New Mexico, and he favored quickly granting statehood to both California and New Mexico in order to avoid reigniting the debate over the Wilmot Proviso. Congress also faced the issue of Utah, which like California and New Mexico, had been ceded by Mexico. Utah was inhabited largely by Mormons, whose practice of polygamy was unpopular in the United States. Aside from the disposition of the territories, other issues had risen to prominence during the Taylor years. The Washington, D.C. slave trade angered many in the North, who viewed the presence of slavery in the capital as a blemish on the nation. Disputes around fugitive slaves had grown since 1830 in part due to improving means of transportation, as escaped slaves used roads, railroads, and ships to escape. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 had granted jurisdiction to all state and federal judges over cases regarding fugitive slaves, but several Northern states, dissatisfied by the lack of due process in these cases, had passed personal liberty laws that made it more difficult to return alleged fugitive slaves to the South. Another issue that would affect the compromise was Texas's debt; it had approximately $10 million in debt left over from its time as an independent nation, and that debt would become a factor in the debates over the territories. = Taylor presidency = The United States at the start of Fillmore's presidency, with Texas's land claims on New Mexico shown. Much of the Mexican Cession remained unorganized. On January 29, 1850, Senator Henry Clay introduced a plan which combined the major subjects under discussion. His legislative package included the admission of California as a free state, the cession by Texas of some of its northern and western territorial claims in return for debt relief, the establishment of New Mexico and Utah territories, a ban on the importation of slaves into the District of Columbia for sale, and a more stringent fugitive slave law. In the final months of his life, Senator Calhoun attempted to rally Southerners against the compromise, arguing that it was biased against the South because it would lead to the creation of new free states. Anti-slavery Northerners like William Seward and Salmon Chase also opposed the compromise. Clay's proposal did, however, win the backing of many Southern and Northern leaders, many of whom attacked opponents of the compromise as extremists. Fillmore, who presided over the Senate in his role as vice president, privately came to support Clay's position. Though Clay had originally favored voting on each of his proposals separately, Senator Henry S. Foote of Mississippi convinced him to combine the proposals regarding California's admission and the disposition of Texas's borders into one bill. Clay hoped that this combination of measures would convince congressmen from both North and South to support the overall package of laws even if they objected to specific provisions. Clay's proposal attracted the support of some Northern Democrats and Southern Whigs, but it lacked the backing necessary to win passage, and debate over the bill continued. Foote and other Southern leaders attempted to condition California's statehood either on granting Texas the full extent of its boundary claims on New Mexico, or on the requirement that slavery be allowed in the disputed region if it was not awarded to Texas. Foote also sought to split California into two states, with the division at the 35th parallel north. Taylor opposed the bill, since he favored granting California statehood immediately and denied the legitimacy of Texas's claims over New Mexico. While Congress continued to debate Clay's proposals, Texas Governor Peter Hansborough Bell loudly protested the organization of New Mexico's constitutional convention, which had been proceeded with the approval of Taylor and the military government of New Mexico instigated by General Stephen W. Kearny during the Mexican-American war. Following the New Mexico constitutional convention, Taylor urged that Congress immediately grant statehood to both California and New Mexico, and he prepared for a clash with Texas. When Taylor died in July 1850, none of the major domestic issues facing his presidency had been settled. = Compromise = Territorial results of the Compromise: The debate over slavery in the territories continued despite Taylor's death. Though Fillmore favored the broad outlines of Clay's compromise, he did not believe that it could pass via a single bill. With Fillmore's support, Senator James Pearce of Maryland helped defeat Clay's compromise bill by proposing to remove a provision related to the Texas-New Mexico boundary. In the ensuing debate, all provisions of the bill were removed except for the organization of Utah Territory. With the apparent collapse of the bill, Clay took a temporary leave from the Senate, and Democratic Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois took the lead in advocating for a compromise based largely on Clay's proposals. Rather than passing the proposals as one bill, Douglas would seek to pass each proposal one-by-one. Upon taking office, Fillmore reinforced federal troops in the disputed New Mexico region, and warned Texas Governor Bell to keep the peace. In an August 6, 1850 message to Congress, Fillmore disclosed a belligerent letter from Governor Bell and his own reply to Bell. In that reply, Fillmore denied Texas's claims to New Mexico, asserting that United States had promised to protect the territorial integrity of New Mexico in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. In his message to Congress, Fillmore also urged Congress to settle the boundary dispute as quickly as possible, and indicated support for providing monetary compensation to Texas in return for the establishment of New Mexico Territory, which would include all of the land it had controlled prior to the Mexican–American War. Fillmore's forceful response helped convince Texas's U.S. Senators, Sam Houston and Thomas Jefferson Rusk, to support Stephen Douglas's compromise. With their support, a senate bill providing for a final settlement of Texas's borders won passage days after Fillmore delivered his message. Under the terms of the bill, the U.S. would assume Texas's debts, while Texas's northern border was set at the 36° 30' parallel north (the Missouri Compromise line) and much of its western border followed the 103rd meridian. The bill attracted the support of a bipartisan coalition of Whigs and Democrats from both sections, though most opposition to the bill came from the South. The Senate quickly moved onto the other major issues, passing bills that provided for the admission of California, the organization of New Mexico Territory, and the establishment of a new fugitive slave law. The debate then moved to the House of Representatives, where Fillmore, Webster, Douglas, Congressman Linn Boyd, and Speaker of the House Howell Cobb took the lead in convincing members to support the compromise bills that had been passed in the Senate. The Senate's proposed settlement of the Texas-New Mexico boundary faced intense opposition from many Southerners, as well as from some Northerners who believed that the Texas did not deserve monetary compensation. After a series of close votes that nearly delayed consideration of the issue, the House voted to approve a Texas bill similar to that which had been passed by the Senate. Following that vote, the House and the Senate quickly agreed on each of the major issues, including the banning of the slave trade in Washington. The president quickly signed each bill into law save for the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850; he ultimately signed that law as well after Attorney General Crittenden assured him that the law was constitutional. Though some in Texas still favored sending a military expedition into New Mexico, in November 1850 the state legislature voted to accept the compromise. Passage of the Compromise of 1850, as it became known, caused celebration in Washington and elsewhere, with crowds shouting, \\"the Union is saved!\\" Fillmore himself described the Compromise of 1850 as a \\"final settlement\\" of sectional issues, though the future of slavery in New Mexico and Utah remained unclear. The admission of new states, or the organization of territories in the remaining unorganized portion of the Louisiana Purchase, could also potentially reopen the polarizing debate over slavery. Not all accepted the Compromise of 1850; a South Carolina newspaper wrote, \\"the Rubicon is passed ... and the Southern States are now vassals in this Confederacy.\\" Many Northerners, meanwhile, were displeased by the fugitive slave law.  Fugitive Slave Act  1851 poster warning that the Boston police enforce the Fugitive Slave Act Fillmore hoped that slavery would one day cease to exist in the United States, but he believed that it was his duty to zealously enforce the Fugitive Slave Act. After 1850, Fillmore's enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act became the central issue of his administration. The Fugitive Slave Act created the first national system of law enforcement by appointing federal commissioner in every county to hear fugitive slave cases and enforce the fugitive slave law. As there were few federal courts operating throughout the country, the appointment of commissioners allowed for the enforcement of a federal law without relying on state courts, many of which were unsympathetic to slave masters or unwilling to even take on fugitive slave cases. The law also penalized commissioners and federal marshals who allowed slaves to escape from their custody, and levied fines against anyone who aided a fugitive slave or interfered with the return of slaves. Fugitive slave proceedings lacked many due process protections such as the right to a jury trial, and defendants were not allowed to testify at their own hearing. Many in the North felt that the Fugitive Slave Act effectively brought slavery into their home states, and while the abolitionist movement remained weak, many Northerners increasingly came to detest slavery. Though the law was highly offensive to many Northerners, Southerners complained bitterly about perceived slackness in enforcement. Many of the administration's prosecutions or attempts to return slaves ended badly for the government, as in the case of Shadrach Minkins. A major controversy erupted over the fate of Ellen and William Craft, two escaped slaves living in Boston. Fillmore threatened to send federal soldiers into the city in order to compel the return of the Crafts to the South, but the Crafts escape to England put an end to the controversy. Disputes over fugitive slaves were widely publicized North and South, inflaming passions and undermining the good feeling that had followed the Compromise. Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote the novel Uncle Tom's Cabin in response to the Fugitive Slave Act, and its publication in 1852 further raised sectional tensions.  Stirrings of disunion  The Compromise of 1850 shook up partisan alignments in South, with elections being contested by unionists and extremist \\"Fire-Eaters\\" rather than Whigs and Democrats. The Georgia Platform represented the moderate Southern position; it opposed secession, but also demanded Northern compromise on the slavery issue. Fire-Eater leaders like Robert Rhett and William Lowndes Yancey urged secession from the United States, and attempted to win control of the states of the Deep South in the 1851 elections. Fillmore took the threat of secession seriously, and on the advice of General Winfield Scott he strengthened the garrisons of federal forts in Charleston and other parts of the South. In the 1851 elections, unionists won victories Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi. Even in South Carolina, the state most open to talk of secession, voters rejected the possibility of unilateral secession from the United States. The victory of pro-compromise Southern politicians in several elections, along with Fillmore's attempts at diligently enforcing the Fugitive Slave Clause, temporarily quieted Southern calls for secession. There was less support for outright secession in the North than in the South, but in the aftermath of the Compromise politicians such as Seward began contemplating the creation of a new major party explicitly opposed to the extension of slavery. Despite the disruptions caused by the debate over the Compromise, no major long-term partisan realignment occurred during Fillmore's presidency, and both parties remained intact for the 1852 presidential election.  Other issues  A longtime supporter of national infrastructure development, Fillmore called for investments in roads, railroads, and waterways. He signed bills to subsidize the Illinois Central railroad from Chicago to Mobile, and for a canal at Sault Ste. Marie. The 1851 completion of the Erie Railroad in New York prompted Fillmore and his cabinet to ride the first train from New York City to the shores of Lake Erie, in company with many other politicians and dignitaries. Fillmore made many speeches along the way from the train's rear platform, urging acceptance of the Compromise, and afterwards went on a tour of New England with his Southern cabinet members. Although Fillmore urged Congress to authorize a transcontinental railroad, it did not do so until a decade later. Fillmore was a longtime proponent of Clay's American System, which favored a high tariff and federally-supported banks and infrastructure projects, but Congress did not consider major revisions to banking laws or the tariff during Fillmore's presidency. In a period of budget surpluses and economic prosperity, few congressmen saw the need for a higher tariff or economic interventionism. In September 1850, Fillmore appointed Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints leader Brigham Young as the first governor of Utah Territory. In gratitude, Young named the first territorial capital \\"Fillmore\\" and the surrounding county \\"Millard\\". In August 1850, the social reformer Dorothea Dix wrote to Fillmore, urging support for her proposal in Congress for land grants to finance asylums for the impoverished mentally ill. Though her proposal did not pass, they became friends and continued to correspond well after Fillmore's presidency. Noting that many miners involved in the California Gold Rush were forced to sell their gold at a discount, Fillmore asked Congress to create a federal mint in California, resulting in the establishment of the San Francisco Mint.  Foreign affairs  Official White House portrait of Millard Fillmore Fillmore oversaw two highly competent Secretaries of State, Webster, and after the New Englander's 1852 death, Edward Everett, looking over their shoulders and making all major decisions. The president was particularly active in Asia and the Pacific, especially with regard to Japan, which at this time still prohibited nearly all foreign contact. American businessmen wanted Japan \\"opened up\\" for trade, and businessmen and the navy alike wanted the ability to visit Japan to stock up on provisions such as coal. Many Americans were also concerned by the fate of shipwrecked American sailors, who were treated as criminals in Japan. Fillmore began planning an expedition to Japan in 1850, but the expedition, led by Commodore Matthew C. Perry, did not leave until November 1852. Though the Perry Expedition did not reach Japan until after Fillmore's presidency, it served as the catalyst for the end of Japan's isolationist policy. Fillmore also supported an effort to build a railroad across Mexico's Isthmus of Tehuantepec, but disagreements among the United States, Mexico, and rival companies prevented the railroad's construction. As part of a broader strategy of establishing U.S. influence in the Pacific, Fillmore and Webster also sought increased influence in Hawaii, which U.S. policymakers saw as an important link between the U.S. and Asia. In 1842, President John Tyler had announced the \\"Tyler doctrine,\\" which proclaimed that the U.S. would not accept annexation of Hawaii by a European power.Herring, pp. 208–209. France under Napoleon III sought to annex Hawaii, but backed down after Fillmore issued a strongly worded message warning that \\"the United States would not stand for any such action.\\" The U.S. also signed a secret treaty with King Kamehameha III of Hawaii which stipulated that the U.S. would gain sovereignty over Hawaii in case of war. Although many in Hawaii and the U.S. desired the annexation of Hawaii as U.S. state, the U.S. was unwilling to grant full citizenship to Hawaii's non-white population.Herring, p. 217. Many Southerners hoped to see Cuba, a Spanish slave-holding colony, annexed to the United States. Venezuelan adventurer Narciso López recruited Americans for three filibustering expeditions to Cuba, in the hope of overthrowing Spanish rule there. After the second attempt in 1850, López and some of his followers were indicted for breach of the Neutrality Act, but were quickly acquitted by friendly Southern juries. Fillmore ordered federal authorities to attempt to prevent López from launching a third expedition, and proclaimed that his administration would not protect anyone captured by Spain. López's third expedition ended in total failure, as the Cuban populace once again refused to rally to their would-be liberator. López and several Americans, including the nephew of Attorney General Crittenden, were executed by the Spanish, while another 160 Americans were forced to work in Spanish mines. Fillmore, Webster and the Spanish government worked out a series of face-saving measures, including the release of the American prisoners, that settled a brewing crisis between the two countries. Following the crisis, Britain and France offered a three-party treaty in which all signatories would agree to uphold Spanish control of Cuba, but Fillmore rejected the offer. Many Southerners, including Whigs, had supported the filibusters, and Fillmore's consistent opposition to the filibusters further divided his party as the 1852 election approached. A much-publicized event of Fillmore's presidency was the arrival in late 1851 of Lajos Kossuth, the exiled leader of a failed Hungarian revolution against Austria. Kossuth wanted the U.S. to recognize Hungary's independence. Many Americans were sympathetic to the Hungarian rebels, especially recent German immigrants, who were now coming to the U.S. in large numbers and had become a major political force. Kossuth was feted by Congress, and Fillmore allowed a White House meeting after receiving word that Kossuth would not try to politicize it. In spite of his promise, Kossuth made a speech promoting his cause. The American enthusiasm for Kossuth petered out, and he departed for Europe; Fillmore refused to change American policy, remaining neutral.  1852 election and completion of term  As the election of 1852 approached, Fillmore remained undecided whether to run for a full term as president. Fillmore's enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act had made him unpopular among many in the North, but he retained considerable support from the South, where he was seen as the only candidate capable of uniting the party. Secretary Webster had long coveted the presidency and, though in poor health, planned a final attempt to gain the White House. Webster hoped that his pro-Compromise stance would help him garner support throughout the country, but his reputation as the spokesman for New England limited his appeal outside of his home region, especially in the South. Fillmore was sympathetic to the ambitions of his longtime friend, but was reluctant to rule out accepting the party's 1852 nomination, as he feared doing so would allow Seward to gain control of the party. Yet he also believed that the Whig nominee was likely to lose in 1852, and feared that a loss would bring an end to his political career. Ultimately, he refused to pull out of the race, and allowed his supporters to run his campaign for the Whig nomination. A third candidate emerged in the form of General Winfield Scott, who, like previously successful Whig presidential nominees William Henry Harrison and Zachary Taylor, had earned fame for his martial accomplishments. Though Thurlow Weed advised Seward to accept whoever the Whigs nominated, Seward threw his backing behind Scott. Scott had supported the Compromise of 1850, but his association with Seward made him unacceptable to Southern Whigs. Thus, approaching the June 1852 Whig National Convention in Baltimore, the major candidates were Fillmore, Webster, and General Scott. Supporters of the Compromise of 1850 were split between Fillmore and Webster, while Northern opponents of the Compromise backed Scott. Stephen Douglas's role in the Compromise of 1850, along with his aggressive rhetoric in foreign policy, had made him a front- runner for the 1852 Democratic nomination. But by the time of the May 1852 Democratic National Convention, former Secretary of State James Buchanan of Pennsylvania had eclipsed Douglas, who had made several enemies in the party and faced rumors about his drinking. The convention deadlocked between 1848 nominee Lewis Cass of Michigan and Buchanan, each of whom led on different ballots. On the 49th ballot, the party nominated former New Hampshire senator Franklin Pierce, who had been out of national politics for nearly a decade before 1852. The nomination of Pierce, a Northerner sympathetic to the Southern view on slavery, united the Democrats and gave the party a decided advantage in the 1852 campaign. Democrat Franklin Pierce defeated Whig Winfield Scott in the 1852 election The 1852 Whig National Convention convened on June 16. Two days later, at the urging of Southern delegates, the Whig National Convention passed a party platform endorsing the Compromise as a final settlement of the slavery question. On the convention's first presidential ballot, Fillmore received 133 of the necessary 147 votes, while Scott won 131 and Webster won 29. After the 46th ballot still failed to produce a presidential nominee, the delegates voted to adjourn until the following Monday. Fillmore supporters offered a deal to the delegates backing Webster: if Webster could win 40 votes on one of the next two ballots, then the Fillmore delegates would switch to Webster. If not, then the Webster delegates would back Fillmore. When informed of the proposed arrangement, Fillmore quickly agreed, but Webster refused to consent to the deal until Monday morning. Scott's supporters were also active over the weekend, and they won the commitment of some delegates who preferred Scott as their second choice. On the 48th ballot, Webster delegates began to defect to Scott, and the general gained the nomination on the 53rd ballot. Webster was far more unhappy at the outcome than was Fillmore, and Fillmore rejected Webster's offer to resign as Secretary of State. Many Southern Whigs, including Alexander H. Stephens and Robert Toombs, refused to support Scott. Scott proved to be a poor candidate who lacked popular appeal, and he suffered the worst defeat in Whig history. Whigs also lost several congressional and state elections. Scott won just four states and 44 percent of the popular vote, while Pierce won just under 51 percent of the popular vote and a large majority of the electoral vote. The party platform's endorsement of the Compromise of 1850 had destroyed Scott's hope of winning the support of the leaders of the Free Soil Party, and the party nominated John P. Hale for president. Hale's candidacy damaged the Whig ticket in the North, while distrust and apathy led many Southern Whigs to vote for Pierce or to sit out the election. The final months of Fillmore's term were uneventful, and Fillmore left office on March 4, 1853.  Historical reputation  Statue of Fillmore outside City Hall in downtown Buffalo, New York According to his biographer, Scarry: \\"No president of the United States ... has suffered as much ridicule as Millard Fillmore\\". He ascribed much of the abuse to a tendency to denigrate the presidents who served in the years just prior to the Civil War as lacking in leadership. For example, later president Harry S. Truman \\"characterized Fillmore as a weak, trivial thumb-twaddler who would do nothing to offend anyone\\", responsible in part for the war. Another Fillmore biographer, Finkelman, commented, \\"on the central issues of the age his vision was myopic and his legacy is worse ... in the end, Fillmore was always on the wrong side of the great moral and political issues\\". Finkelman argues that the central accomplishment of Fillmore's tenure, the Compromise of 1850, should instead be called the \\"Appeasement of 1850\\" due to its abandoning of the Wilmot Proviso, thereby opening up all of the territories of the Mexican Cession to slavery. Although Fillmore has become something of a cult figure as America's most forgettable chief executive, Smith found him to be \\"a conscientious president\\" who chose to honor his oath of office and enforce the Fugitive Slave Act, rather than govern based on his personal preferences. According to Smith, the enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act has given Fillmore an undeserved pro-southern reputation, and the evaluation of his presidency has also suffered because \\"even those who give him high marks for his support of the compromise have done so almost grudgingly, probably because of his Know-Nothing candidacy in 1856\\". Paul G. Calabresi and Christopher S. Yoo, in their study of presidential power, deemed Fillmore \\"a faithful executor of the laws of the United States—for good and for ill\\". Rayback applauded \\"the warmth and wisdom with which he had defended the Union\\". Benson Lee Grayson suggested that Fillmore's constant attention to Mexico avoided a resumption of the war and laid the groundwork for the Gadsden Treaty during Pierce's presidency. Fred I. Greenstein and Dale Anderson praised Fillmore for his resoluteness in his early months in office, noting that Fillmore \\"is typically described as stolid, bland, and conventional, but such terms underestimate the forcefulness evinced by his handling of the Texas–New Mexico border crisis, his decision to replace Taylor's entire cabinet, and his effectiveness in advancing the Compromise of 1850\\". Polls of historians and political scientists have generally ranked Fillmore in the bottom quartile of presidents. A 2018 poll of the American Political Science Association’s Presidents and Executive Politics section ranked Fillmore as the sixth-worst president. A 2017 C-Span poll of historians ranked Fillmore as the seventh- worst president.

Pierce, a Democrat from New Hampshire, took office as the 14th United States president after routing Whig Party nominee Winfield Scott in the 1852 presidential election. Seen by fellow Democrats as pleasant and accommodating to all the party's factions, Pierce, then a little-known politician, won the presidential nomination on the 49th ballot of the 1852 Democratic National Convention. Pierce vetoed funding for internal improvements, called for a lower tariff, and vigorously enforced the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. Influenced by the Young America expansionist movement, the Pierce administration completed the Gadsden land purchase from Mexico, clashed with Britain in Central America, and led a failed attempt to acquire Cuba from Spain. Pierce's administration was severely criticized after several of his diplomats issued the Ostend Manifesto, which called for the annexation of Cuba, by force if necessary. His popularity in the Northern free states declined sharply after he supported the 1854 Kansas–Nebraska Act, which nullified the Missouri Compromise. Passage of the act led directly to a long and violent conflict over the expansion of slavery in the American West. In the wake of the Kansas–Nebraska Act, the Whig Party fell apart, and the Democratic Party was severely weakened. With the Whig Party's break-up, two new major parties emerged in the nativist American Party and the anti-slavery Republican Party. Pierce actively sought renomination at the 1856 Democratic National Convention, but he was defeated by James Buchanan, who had served as Pierce's ambassador to Britain. Buchanan went on to win the 1856 presidential election, defeating the nominees of the American Party and the Republican Party. Pierce is viewed by presidential historians as an inept chief executive, whose failure to stem the nation's inter–sectional conflict accelerated the course towards civil war. He is generally ranked as one of the worst presidents of all time. Election of 1852 alt=Poster As the 1852 presidential election approached, the Democrats were divided by the slavery issue, though most of the \\"Barnburners\\" who had left the party in 1848 with Martin Van Buren had returned. Major presidential contenders included Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois, James Buchanan of Pennsylvania, William Marcy of New York, Sam Houston of Texas, Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri, and Lewis Cass of Michigan, the latter of whom had been the party's 1848 nominee.Wallner (2004), pp. 181–84; Gara (1991), pp, 23–29. Due to the divisions in party and the lack of a strong Southern candidate, many Democratic leaders expected that the party would compromise on a lesser-known Northern candidate who held views acceptable to the South. New Hampshire Democrats, including Franklin Pierce, favored the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Levi Woodbury, but Woodbury died in 1851.Gara (1991), pp. 28–29. After the death of Woodbury, New Hampshire Democrats coalesced around Pierce, a former member of Congress who had served as a brigadier general in the Mexican–American War.Gara (1991), pp. 29–32. Pierce allowed his supporters to lobby for him, with the understanding that his name would not be entered at the convention unless it was clear none of the front-runners could win. To broaden his potential base of southern support as the convention approached, he wrote letters reiterating his support for the Compromise of 1850, including the controversial Fugitive Slave Act.Wallner (2004), pp. 184–97; Gara (1991), pp. 32–33. The 1852 Democratic National Convention assembled on June 1 in Baltimore, Maryland, and, as had been widely expected, a deadlock occurred. On the first ballot, 288 delegates, Cass claimed 116 of the 288 delegates, while Buchanan won 93 delegates and the remaining votes were scattered among various candidates. The next 34 ballots passed with no one near victory; Pierce did not receive a single vote on any of the ballots. Eventually, the Buchanan team decided to have their delegates vote for minor candidates, including Pierce, to demonstrate that no one but Buchanan could win. This novel tactic backfired after several ballots when Virginia, New Hampshire, and Maine switched to Pierce. After the 48th ballot, North Carolina Congressman James C. Dobbin delivered an unexpected and passionate endorsement of Pierce, sparking a wave of support for the dark horse candidate. On the 49th ballot, Pierce received all but six of the votes, and thus gained the Democratic nomination for president. Delegates selected Alabama Senator William R. King, a Buchanan supporter, as Pierce's running mate, and adopted a party platform that rejected further \\"agitation\\" over the slavery issue and supported the Compromise of 1850.Wallner (2004), pp. 197–202; Gara (1991), pp. 33–34. alt=Political cartoon Rejecting incumbent President Millard Fillmore, the Whigs nominated General Winfield Scott, whom Pierce had served under in the Mexican–American War. The Whigs convention adopted a platform almost indistinguishable from that of the Democrats, including support of the Compromise of 1850. This incited the Free Soilers to field their own candidate, Senator John P. Hale of New Hampshire, at the expense of the Whigs. The lack of political differences between the major parties reduced the campaign to a bitter personality contest and helped to dampen voter turnout in the election to its lowest level since 1836; it was, according to Pierce biographer Peter A. Wallner, \\"one of the least exciting campaigns in presidential history\\".Wallner (2004), pp. 210–13; Gara (1991), pp. 36–38. Quote from Gara, 38. Scott was harmed by the lack of enthusiasm of anti-slavery northern Whigs for the candidate and platform; New-York Tribune editor Horace Greeley summed up the attitude of many when he said of the Whig platform, \\"we defy it, execrate it, spit upon it\\".Holt (2010), loc. 724. Southern Whigs were even less enthusiastic about Scott, since they feared that his administration would be dominated by anti-slavery northerners like William Seward.Gara (1991), p. 37. Pierce, meanwhile kept quiet so as not to upset his party's delicate unity, and allowed his allies to run the campaign. It was the custom at the time for candidates to not appear to seek the office, and he did no personal campaigning.Wallner (2004), p. 231; Gara (1991), p. 38, Holt (2010), loc. 725. Pierce's opponents caricatured him as an anti-Catholic coward and alcoholic (\\"the hero of many a well-fought bottle\\").Wallner (2004), p. 206; Gara (1991), p. 38. alt=Map Ultimately, Scott won only Kentucky, Tennessee, Massachusetts and Vermont, finishing with 42 electoral votes to Pierce's 254. With 3.2 million votes cast, Pierce won the popular vote with 50.9 to 44.1 percent. A sizable block of Free Soilers broke for Pierce's in- state rival, Hale, who won 4.9 percent of the popular vote.Wallner (2004), pp. 229–30; Gara (1991), p. 39. In the concurrent congressional elections, the Democrats increased their majorities in both houses of Congress.Holt (2010), loc. 740. Tragedy and transition Pierce began his presidency in mourning. Weeks after his election, on January 6, 1853, the president-elect's family had been traveling from Boston by train when their car derailed and rolled down an embankment near Andover, Massachusetts. Pierce and his wife, Jane survived, but their only remaining son, Benjamin, was crushed to death. Pierce and Jane both suffered severe depression afterward, which likely affected Pierce's performance as president.Wallner (2004), pp. 241–49; Gara (1991), pp. 43–44. Jane would avoid social functions for much of her first two years as First Lady, making her public debut in that role to great sympathy at the public reception held at the White House on New Year's Day, 1855.Boulard (2006), p. 55. Jane remained in New Hampshire as Pierce departed for his inauguration, which she did not attend. Pierce, the youngest man to be elected president to that point, chose to affirm his oath of office on a law book rather than swear it on a Bible, as all his predecessors except John Quincy Adams had done. He was the first president to deliver his inaugural address from memory. In the address he hailed an era of peace and prosperity at home and urged a vigorous assertion of U.S. interests in its foreign relations, including the \\"eminently important\\" acquisition of new territories. \\"The policy of my administration\\", said the new president, \\"will not be deterred by any timid forebodings of evil from expansion.\\" Avoiding the word \\"slavery\\", he emphasized his desire to put the \\"important subject\\" to rest and maintain a peaceful union. He alluded to his own personal tragedy, telling the crowd, \\"You have summoned me in my weakness, you must sustain me by your strength.\\"Wallner (2004), pp. 249–55. Administration In his cabinet appointments, Pierce sought to unite the party by appointing Democrats from all factions, including those that had not supported the Compromise of 1850. He anchored his cabinet around Attorney General Caleb Cushing, a pro-compromise northerner, and Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, who had led Southern resistance to the compromise in the Senate. For the key position of Secretary of State, Pierce chose William Marcy, who had served as Secretary of War under President Polk. To appease the Cass and Buchanan wings of the party, Pierce appointed Secretary of the Interior Robert McClelland of Michigan and Postmaster General James Campbell of Pennsylvania, respectively. Pierce rounded out his geographically-balanced cabinet with Secretary of the Navy James C. Dobbin of North Carolina and Secretary of the Treasury James Guthrie of Kentucky. All initial cabinet appointees would remain in place throughout Pierce's presidency.Holt, pp. 48-52 Pierce's cabinet notably lacked a prominent Southern unionist such as Howell Cobb, and also did not include a representative from Stephen Douglas's faction of the party.Gara (1991), pp. 44–47. Pierce spent the first few weeks of his term sorting through hundreds of lower-level federal positions to be filled. This was a chore, as he sought to represent all factions of the party, and could fully satisfy none of them. Partisans found themselves unable to secure positions for their friends, which put the Democratic Party on edge and fueled bitterness between factions. Before long, northern newspapers accused Pierce of filling his government with pro-slavery secessionists, while Southern newspapers accused him of abolitionism.Wallner (2007), pp. 5–24. Factionalism between the pro- and anti-administration Democrats ramped up quickly, especially within the New York Democratic Party. The more conservative Hardshell Democrats or \\"Hards\\" of New York were deeply skeptical of the Pierce administration, which was associated with Secretary of State Marcy and the more moderate New York faction, the Softshell Democrats or \\"Softs\\".Wallner (2007), pp. 15–18, and throughout. alt=Photograph of William R. King Pierce's running mate William R. King became severely ill with tuberculosis, and after the election he went to Cuba to recuperate. His condition deteriorated, and Congress passed a special law, allowing him to be sworn in before the American consul in Havana on March 24. Wanting to die at home, he returned to his plantation in Alabama on April 17 and died the next day. The office of vice president remained vacant for the remainder of Pierce's term, as the Constitution had no provision for filling an intra-term vice presidential vacancy prior to ratification of the Twenty-fifth Amendment in 1967. As such, the President pro tempore of the Senate, initially David Atchison of Missouri, was next in line to the presidency for the duration of Pierce's presidency.Wallner (2007), pp. 21–22. Judicial appointments There was a vacancy on the Supreme Court when Pierce took office, due to the death of John McKinley in 1852. President Fillmore had made several nominations to fill the vacancy before the end of his term, but his nominees were denied confirmation by the Senate. Pierce quickly nominated John Archibald Campbell, an advocate of states' rights, for the seat; he would be Pierce's only Supreme Court appointment.Wallner (2007), p. 10. Pierce also appointed three judges to the United States circuit courts and twelve judges to the United States district courts. He was the first president to appoint judges to the United States Court of Claims. Domestic affairs The slavery debate =Kansas–Nebraska Act= The United States after the Compromise of 1850 In his inaugural address, Pierce expressed hope that the Compromise of 1850 would settle the debate over the issue of slavery in the territories. The compromise had allowed slavery in Utah Territory and New Mexico Territory, which had been acquired in the Mexican–American War. The Missouri Compromise, which banned slavery in territories north of the 36°30′ parallel, remained in place for the other U.S. territories acquired in Louisiana Purchase, including a vast unorganized territory often referred to as \\"Nebraska\\". As settlers poured into the unorganized territory, and commercial and political interests called for a transcontinental railroad through the region, pressure mounted for the organization of the eastern parts of the unorganized territory.Holt, pp. 53-54, 72-73 Organizing the territory was necessary for settlement as the land would not be surveyed nor put up for sale until a territorial government was authorized. alt=Map Pierce wanted to organize the territories without explicitly addressing the matter of slavery, but Senator Stephen Douglas could not get enough southern support to accomplish this.Etchison, p. 14. Slave state leaders had never been content with western limits on slavery, and felt that slavery should be able to expand into territories, while many Northern leaders were strongly opposed to any such expansion. Douglas and his allies instead proposed a bill to organize the territory and let local settlers decide whether to allow slavery, effectively repealing the Missouri Compromise of 1820, as most of land in question was north of the 36°30′ parallel. Under Douglas's bill, two new territories would be created: Kansas Territory would be located directly west of Missouri, while Nebraska Territory would be located north of Kansas Territory. The common expectation was that the people of the Nebraska Territory would not allow slavery, while the people of the Kansas Territory would allow slavery. Free Soiler is held down by Pierce, Buchanan, and Cass while Douglas shoves \\"Slavery\\" (depicted as a black man) down his throat.alt=Political cartoon Pierce was initially skeptical of Douglas's bill, knowing it would arouse bitter opposition from the North, but Douglas, Secretary of War Davis, and a group of powerful Southern senators known as the \\"F Street Mess\\" convinced Pierce to support the bill.McPherson (1988), pp. 122–123. It was tenaciously opposed by Northerners such as Ohio Senator Salmon P. Chase and Massachusetts' Charles Sumner, who rallied public sentiment in the North against the bill. Many Northerners had been suspicious of the Pierce's expansionist foreign policy and the influence of slaveholding Cabinet members such as Davis, and they saw the Nebraska bill as part of a pattern of southern aggression. Pierce and his administration used threats and promises to keep most Democrats on board in favor of the bill. The Whigs split along sectional lines, and the conflict finally destroyed the ailing party. The Kansas–Nebraska Act passed the Senate with relative ease, but was nearly derailed in the House. Pressure by Douglas and Pierce, combined with the support of many Southern Whigs, ensured the bill's passage in May 1854.Wallner (2007), pp. 90–102, 119–22; Gara (1991), pp. 88–100, Holt (2010), loc. 1097–1240. In both the House and the Senate, every Northern Whig voted against the Kansas–Nebraska Act, while just under half of the Northern Democrats and the vast majority of Southern congressmen of both parties voted for the act.McPherson (1988), pp. 125–126. =Bleeding Kansas= Even as the Kansas- Nebraska Act was being debated, settlers on both sides of the slavery issue poured into Kansas so as to influence the status of slavery in Kansas. The passage of the act resulted in so much violence between groups that the territory became known as Bleeding Kansas. Thousands of pro-slavery Border Ruffians came across from Missouri to vote in the territorial elections, giving the pro-slavery element control over the territorial government. Pierce supported the outcome despite the irregularities. The new legislature subsequently adopted laws that criminalized reading Free Soil literature, disenfranchised those who refused to uphold the Fugitive Slave Act, and barred non-slave owners from holding public office. When Free-Staters set up a shadow government and drafted the Topeka Constitution, Pierce called their work an act of rebellion and ordered an army contingent to prevent the Topeka government from meeting. The president continued to recognize the pro-slavery legislature, which was dominated by Democrats, even after a congressional investigative committee found its election to have been illegitimate. In response to Pierce's actions, several Northern state legislatures passed resolutions in support of anti-slavery groups in Kansas. Robert Toombs arranged a compromise Kansas statehood bill that won passage in the Senate, but Pierce's opponents in the House defeated the bill. The violence in Kansas escalated in 1856, and pro-slavery forces ransacked the town of Lawrence. That same year, in the Pottawatomie massacre, an anti-slavery group led by John Brown killed pro-slavery settlers.Wallner (2007), pp. 195–209; Gara (1991), pp. 111–23. The situation calmed somewhat after Pierce appointed the even- handed John W. Geary as governor of the territory, but tensions remained high by the time Pierce left office.Gara (1991), pp. 123–126. =Other issues= Passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act coincided with the seizure of escaped slave Anthony Burns in Boston. Northerners rallied in support of Burns, but Pierce was determined to follow the Fugitive Slave Act to the letter, and dispatched federal troops to enforce Burns' return to his Virginia owner despite furious crowds.Wallner (2007), pp. 122–25; Gara (1991), pp. 107–09. The simultaneous repeal of the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and the enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act alienated many Northerners, including those who had formerly accepted the Fugitive Slave Act as a sectional compromise. Textile magnate Amos Adams Lawrence described the reaction of many Northern Whigs to the Pierce administration's enforcement of fugitive slave law, writing \\"we went to bed one night old fashioned, conservative, Compromise Union Whigs and woke up stark mad abolitionists.\\"McPherson (1988), p. 120. Several northern states enacted personal liberty laws designed to prevent the kidnapping of free blacks and to make it more difficult to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act.Gara (1991), pp. 105–106. Fugitive slave controversies, including that of Margaret Garner, continued to attract controversy throughout Pierce's presidency.McPherson (1988), pp. 120–121. In response to an anti-slavery speech by Senator Charles Sumner, Congressman Preston Brooks of South Carolina beat Sumner with a cane, leaving Sumner unable to return to the Senate until 1859. The House of Representatives voted to censure Brooks, and Brooks resigned from the House only to win re-election shortly thereafter. Many in the South supported Brooks's actions; the Richmond Enquirer wrote that the \\"Vulgar Abolitionists are getting above themselves...They must be lashed into submission.\\" Many northerners, meanwhile, were horrified by the political violence.Gara (1991), pp. 120–122. Partisan re-alignment The Compromise of 1850 had split both major parties along geographic lines. In several Northern states, Democrats opposed to the compromise had joined with Free Soil Party to take control of state governments. In the South, many state parties had also been split by the compromise. The vast majority of northerners did not favor abolition, but northerners were hostile to the extension of slavery into the western territories, since they feared that such extension would lead to the exclusion of settlers from free states. Supporters of the \\"Free Soil\\" movement (which was not exclusive to members of the Free Soil Party) wanted to limit slavery to the states in which it currently existed. Southerners, meanwhile, resented any interference with their institutions and believed that slavery's continued existence required the expansion of the practice into the territories.Gara (1991), pp. 158–159. Hoping to keep his own party unified, Pierce appointed both supporters and opponents of the Compromise of 1850 from both the North and South. This policy infuriated both supporters and opponents of the compromise, particularly in the South.Holt (2010), pp. 47-48, 66-70 Pierce demanded that all loyal Democrats support the Kansas-Nebraska Act, hoping that debates over that act and the development of the West would reinvigorate partisan conflict and distract from intra-party battles. But the bill instead polarized legislators sectional lines, with Southern Whigs providing critical votes in the House as a narrow majority of Northern Democrats voted against it. The Whigs, meanwhile, continued to decline as a party. The Free Soil Party won support from many who were sympathetic to the temperance movement, while the Know Nothing movement capitalized on growing nativist fears over Catholic immigrants.Gara (1991), pp. 96–98. This nativism was fueled by an increase in immigration during the 1850s, as well as higher crime rates and spending on relief for the poor, which many voters attributed to immigration.McPherson (1988), pp. 131–132. William Seward and some other Northern Whigs tried to bring Free Soilers and Democrats who were opposed to the Kansas-Nebraska Act into the Whig Party, but many of these individuals preferred to establish a new party dedicated to \\"the establishment of liberty and the overthrow of the Slave Power.\\" A new, anti-slavery party was established at a rally in Ripon, Wisconsin, in May 1854, and that party became known as the Republican Party.McPherson (1988), pp. 126. Republican leaders, including Abraham Lincoln (who did not formally leave the Whig party until after the 1854 elections), generally did not call for the abolition of slavery, but instead called for Congress to prevent the extension of slavery into the territories.McPherson (1988), p. 129. Congressional Democrats suffered huge losses in the mid-term elections of 1854, as voters provided support to a wide array of new parties opposed to the Democrats and the Kansas-Nebraska Act.McPherson (1988), pp. 129–130. In several states, opponents of the Kansas-Nebraska Act and the Democratic Party merely labeled themselves the \\"Opposition.\\" Members of the Know Nothing movement defeated numerous Northeastern and Southern congressional candidates from both the Whig and Democratic parties.Holt (2010), pp. 78-89 Most Northern Know Nothings opposed the Kansas-Nebraska Act, and anti-slavery groups allied with the Know Nothing movement in several states despite the discomfort many anti-slavery leaders felt towards nativism.McPherson (1988), pp. 136–138. In Pierce's home state of New Hampshire, hitherto loyal to the Democratic Party, the Know- Nothings elected the governor, all three representatives, dominated the legislature, and returned John P. Hale to the Senate.Wallner (2007), pp. 158–67; Gara (1991), pp. 99–100. When the 34th Congress convened, the House consisted of approximately 105 Republicans, 80 Democrats, and 50 members of the Know Nothing-affiliated American Party.McPherson (1988), pp. 143–144. Nathaniel Banks, who was affiliated with both the Know Nothings and the Free Soil Party, won election as Speaker of the House after a protracted battle.Holt (2010), pp. 92-93 By 1855, Republicans had replaced the Whigs as the main opposition to the Democrats in about half of the states, with the Know Nothings displacing the Whigs in the remaining states. Some Democrats joined the American Party in states like Maryland, but in many Southern states the American Party consisted almost entirely of former Whigs.McPherson (1988), pp. 140–141. The Know Nothings soon split along sectional lines over a proposal to restore the Missouri Compromise, and as the controversy over Kansas continued, Know Nothings, Whigs, and even Democrats became increasingly attracted to the Republican Party. Pierce declared his full opposition the Republican Party, decrying what he saw as its anti-southern stance, but his perceived pro-Southern actions in Kansas continued to inflame Northern anger.Holt (2010), pp. 91-94, 99, 106-109 Economic policy and internal improvements alt=Photograph of Indian Peace Medal Pierce frequently vetoed federally-funded internal improvements such as roads and canals. The first bill he vetoed would have provided funding for mental asylums, a cause championed by reformer Dorothea Dix. In vetoing the bill, Pierce stated, \\"I cannot find any authority in the Constitution for making the Federal Government the great almoner of public charity throughout the United States.\\" Though he vetoed several other internal improvement projects, Pierce did sign some bills providing for federal funding for infrastructure projects; Northern critics charged that Pierce tended to favor projects that benefited the South.Gara (1991), pp. 87–88. Pierce also called for a lowering of the Walker tariff, which had itself lowered the tariff rates to an historically low level.Holt, pp. 53-54, 71. In the final days of his presidency, Pierce signed the Tariff of 1857, which further reduced tariff rates. Despite his opposition to federal funding for most infrastructure projects, Pierce favored federal aid for the construction of a transcontinental railroad.Gara (1991), pp. 78–79. Secretary of War Davis, at Pierce's request, led surveys with the Corps of Topographical Engineers of possible transcontinental railroad routes throughout the country. The Democratic Party had long rejected federal appropriations for internal improvements, but Davis felt that such a project could be justified as a Constitutional national security objective. Davis also deployed the Army Corps of Engineers to supervise construction projects in the District of Columbia, including the expansion of the United States Capitol and building of the Washington Monument.Wallner (2007), pp. 40–41, 52. The Army Corps of Engineers surveyed four possible transcontinental railroad routes, all of which would eventually be used by railroads. Davis favored the most Southern railroad route, which extended from New Orleans to San Diego, and his opposition to more Northern routes helped ensure that the construction of a transcontinental railroad would not begin until after Pierce left office.Gara (1991), pp. 66–67. Administrative reforms Pierce sought to run a more efficient and accountable government than his predecessors. His cabinet members implemented an early system of civil service examinations which was a forerunner to the Pendleton Act passed three decades later.Wallner (2007), pp. 35–36. The Interior Department was reformed by Secretary Robert McClelland, who systematized its operations, expanded the use of paper records, and pursued fraud.Wallner (2007), pp. 36–39. Another of Pierce's reforms was to expand the role of the attorney general in appointing federal judges and attorneys, which was an important step in the eventual development of the Justice Department.Wallner (2007), p. 20. Pierce charged Treasury Secretary Guthrie with reforming the Treasury Department, which was inefficiently managed and had many unsettled accounts. Guthrie increased oversight of Treasury employees and tariff collectors, many of whom were withholding money from the government. Despite laws requiring funds to be held in the Treasury, large deposits remained in private banks under the Whig administrations. Guthrie reclaimed these funds and sought to prosecute corrupt officials, with mixed success.Wallner (2007), pp. 32–36. Foreign and military affairs The Pierce administration fell in line with the expansionist Young America movement, with William L. Marcy leading the charge as Secretary of State. Marcy sought to present to the world a distinctively American, republican image. He issued a circular recommending that U.S. diplomats wear \\"the simple dress of an American citizen\\" instead of the elaborate diplomatic uniforms worn in the courts of Europe, and that they only hire American citizens to work in consulates.Wallner (2007), pp. 25–32; Gara (1991), p. 128. Marcy received international praise for his 73-page letter defending Austrian refugee Martin Koszta, who had been captured abroad in mid-1853 by the Austrian government despite his intention to become a U.S. citizen.Wallner (2007), pp. 61–63; Gara (1991), pp. 128–29. Gadsden Purchase A map of the lands ceded by Mexico in the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and the 1853 Gadsden Purchase Secretary of War Davis, an advocate of a southern transcontinental railroad route, persuaded Pierce to send rail magnate James Gadsden to Mexico to buy land for a potential railroad. Gadsden was also charged with re-negotiating provisions of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo which required the U.S. to prevent Native American raids into Mexico from New Mexico Territory. Pierce authorized Gadsden to negotiate a treaty offering $50 million for large portions of Northern Mexico, including all of Baja California.Holt, pp. 54-55. Gadsden ultimately concluded a less far-reaching treaty with Mexican President Antonio López de Santa Anna in December 1853, purchasing a portion of the Mexican state of Sonora. Negotiations were nearly derailed by William Walker's unauthorized expedition into Mexico, and so a clause was included charging the U.S. with combating future such attempts. Other provisions in the treaty included U.S. assumption of all private claims by American citizens against the Mexican government, and American access to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec for transit. Pierce was disappointed by the treaty, and Gadsden would later claim that, if not for Walker's expedition, Mexico would have ceded the Baja California Peninsula and more of the state of Sonora.Wallner (2007), pp. 75–81; Gara (1991), pp. 129–33. The treaty received a hostile reception from northern congressmen, many of whom saw it as another move designed to benefit the Slave Power. Congress reduced the Gadsden Purchase to the region now comprising southern Arizona and part of southern New Mexico; the original treaty had ceded a port on the Gulf of California to the United States. Congress also reduced the amount of money being paid to Mexico from $15 million to $10 million, and included a protection clause for a private citizen, Albert G. Sloo, whose interests were threatened by the purchase. Pierce opposed the use of the federal government to prop up private industry and did not endorse the final version of the treaty, which was ratified nonetheless.Wallner (2007), pp. 106–08; Gara (1991), pp. 129–33. The acquisition brought the contiguous United States to its present-day boundaries, excepting later minor adjustments.Holt, loc. 872. Relations with Britain During Pierce's presidency, relations with the United Kingdom were tense due to disputes over American fishing rights in Canada and U.S. and British ambitions in Central America.Holt, pp. 55-56. Marcy completed a trade reciprocity agreement with British minister to Washington, John Crampton, which would reduce the need for British naval patrols in Canadian waters. The treaty, which Pierce saw as a first step towards the American annexation of Canada, was ratified in August 1854.Wallner (2007), pp. 27–30, 63–66, 125–26; Gara (1991), p. 133. While the administration negotiated with Britain over the Canada–U.S. border, U.S. interests were also threatened in Central America, where the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty of 1850 had failed to keep Britain from expanding its influence. Secretary of State Buchanan sought to persuade Britain to relinquish their territories in Central America.Holt, pp. 58-59. Seeking to ensure friendly relations with the United States during the Crimean War, the British were prepared to renounce most of their claims in Central America, but an incident in the British-protected port of Greytown soured Anglo-American relations. The murder of an employee of an American company led Pierce to order the to Greytown, and Cyane destroyed Greytown. Despite the destruction of Greytown and American filibusters in Central America, British merchants strongly opposed any war with the United States, ensuring that no war broke out between the two countries. Buchanan's successor as ambassador to Britain, George M. Dallas, concluded a treaty with Britain in which the British agreed to withdrawal from Greytown and most other Central American territories in return for U.S. recognition of British interests in Belize, but the Senate did not ratify the agreement.Gara (1991), pp. 140–145. Ostend Manifesto Like many of his predecessors, Pierce hoped to annex the Spanish island of Cuba, which possessed wealthy sugar plantations, held a strategic position in the Caribbean Sea, and represented the possibility of a new slave state. Pierce appointed Young America adherent Pierre Soulé as his minister to Spain, and Soulé quickly alienated the Spanish government.Holt, pp. 59-60. After the Black Warrior Affair, in which the Spanish seized a U.S. merchant ship in Havana, the Pierce administration contemplated invading Cuba or aiding a filibuster expedition with the same intent, but the administration ultimately decided on focusing its efforts on the purchase of Cuba from Spain.Holt, pp. 60-62. Ambassadors Soulé, Buchanan, and John Y. Mason drafted a document that proposed to purchase Cuba from Spain for $120 million (USD), but also attempted to justify the \\"wresting\\" of Cuba from Spain if the offer were refused. The document, essentially a position paper meant only for the consumption of the Pierce administration, did not offer any new thinking on the U.S. position towards Cuba and Spain, and was not intended to serve as a public edict.Holt, pp. 63-65. Nonetheless, the publication of the Ostend Manifesto provoked the scorn of northerners who viewed it as an attempt to annex a slave-holding possession. Publication of the document helped discredit the expansionist policy of Manifest Destiny the Democratic Party had often supported.Wallner (2007), pp. 131–57; Gara (1991), pp. 149–55. Other issues Secretary of War Davis and Navy Secretary James C. Dobbin found the Army and Navy in poor condition, with insufficient forces, a reluctance to adopt new technology, and inefficient management.Wallner (2007), pp. 40–43. During the Pierce administration, Congress increased the proportion of the federal budget spent on the War Department from 20 percent to 28 percent. Davis directed this money to fund a larger army, improvements to the United States Military Academy, and other measures.Gara (1991), p. 68. Dobbin favored several reforms, including a transition of the Navy to steam power, and he won congressional authorization for the construction of several new ships.Gara (1991), pp. 68–69. During the Pierce administration, Commodore Matthew C. Perry visited Japan (a venture originally planned under Fillmore) in an effort to expand trade to the East. Perry signed a modest trade treaty with the Japanese shogunate which was successfully ratified. Marcy selected the first American consul to Japan, Townsend Harris, who helped further expand trade between Japan and the United States. Perry also advocated the American colonization of Taiwan, Okinawa, and the Bonin Islands, but the Pierce administration did not endorse Perry's proposals.Wallner (2007), p. 172; Gara (1991), pp. 134–35. Pierce attempted to purchase Samaná Bay from the Dominican Republic, since he feared that the Dominican Republican's instability would lead it to an alliance with France or Spain. The Dominican insistence on protection of the rights of Dominican citizens in the United States \\"without distinction of race or colour\\" prevented any Dominican-American treaty from being reached.Gara (1991), pp. 146–147. The Pierce administration explored the possibility of annexing the Kingdom of Hawaii, but King Kamehameha III's insistence on full citizenship for all Hawaiian citizens regardless of race precluded any possibility of annexation during Pierce's presidency.Gara (1991), pp. 147–148. In 1856, Congress passed the Guano Islands Act, which allowed U.S. citizens to take possession of unclaimed islands containing guano deposits. Guano, the accumulated excrement of seabirds, was valuable as a fertilizer. Long after Pierce left office, the act would be used to make claims on several territories, including the Midway Atoll.Gara (1991), pp. 148–149. Election of 1856 and transition As the 1856 election approached, many Democrats spoke of replacing Pierce with Buchanan or Douglas, but Pierce retained the support of his cabinet and many others within the party, especially in the South. Buchanan, who had been outside of the country since 1853 and thus could not be associated with the unpopular Kansas-Nebraska Act, became the candidate of many Northern Democrats.Holt (2010), pp. 94-96 When balloting began on June 5 at the convention in Cincinnati, Ohio, Pierce expected to win a plurality, if not the required two-thirds majority, of the vote. On the first ballot, he received only 122 votes, many of them from the South, to Buchanan's 135, with Douglas and Cass receiving the remaining votes. By the following morning fourteen ballots had been completed, but none of the three main candidates were able to get two-thirds of the vote. Pierce, whose support had been slowly declining as the ballots passed, directed his supporters to break for Douglas, withdrawing his name in a last-ditch effort to defeat Buchanan. Douglas, only 43 years of age, believed that he could be nominated in 1860 if he let the older Buchanan win this time, and received assurances from Buchanan's managers that this would be the case. After two more deadlocked ballots, Douglas's managers withdrew his name, leaving Buchanan as the clear winner. To soften the blow to Pierce, the convention issued a resolution of \\"unqualified approbation\\" in praise of his administration and selected his ally, former Kentucky Representative John C. Breckinridge, as the vice-presidential nominee.Wallner (2007), pp. 266–70; Gara (1991), pp. 157–67, Holt (2010), loc. 1515–58. This loss marked the only time in U.S. history that an elected president who was an active candidate for reelection was not nominated for a second term. alt=Map Pierce endorsed Buchanan, though the two remained distant, and the president attempted to resolve the Kansas situation by November to improve the Democrats' chances in the general election.Wallner (2007), pp. 272–80. Though Governor Geary was able to restore order in Kansas, the electoral damage had already been done—Republicans used \\"Bleeding Kansas\\" and \\"Bleeding Sumner\\" (the brutal caning of Charles Sumner) as election slogans.Holt (2010), loc. 1610. The Democratic Party's platform, along with Buchanan's endorsement of Pierce's policies, caused many northern Democrats to abandon the party.Gara (1991), pp. 167–168. The Know Nothing National Convention alienated many Northern Know Nothings by nominating former President Fillmore for another term and failing to oppose the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Fillmore also received the presidential nomination at sparsely attended 1856 Whig convention. Fillmore minimized the issue of nativism, instead attempting to use the party as a platform for unionism and a revival of the Whig Party.Gara (1991), pp. 175–176. The 1856 Republican National Convention chose John C. Frémont as the party's presidential candidate. Though Frémont's public views were not widely known, Republicans hoped to use Frémont's military reputation to lead the party to victory in 1856.Gara (1991), pp. 168–174. The Democratic ticket was elected, but Buchanan won only five of sixteen free states (Pierce had won fourteen). Frémont, the Republican nominee, won the remaining eleven free states, while Fillmore won Maryland. In the North, the Democratic share of the popular vote fell from Pierce's 49.8% in 1852 to just 41.4%. The strong Republican showing confirmed that they, and not the Know Nothings, would replace the Whigs as the main opposition to the Democrats.Holt (2010), pp. 109-110 Pierce did not temper his rhetoric after losing the nomination. In his final message to Congress, delivered in December 1856, he blamed anti-slavery activists for Bleeding Kansas and vigorously attacked the Republican Party as a threat to the unity of the nation.Holt (2010), pp. 110-114 He also took the opportunity to defend his record on fiscal policy, and on achieving peaceful relations with other nations.Wallner (2007), pp. 292–96; Gara (1991), pp. 177–79. In the final days of the Pierce administration, Congress passed bills to increase the pay of army officers and to build new naval vessels, also expanding the number of seamen enlisted. It also passed a tariff reduction bill he had long sought, establishing the Tariff of 1857.Wallner (2007), pp. 303–04. During the transition period, Pierce avoided criticizing Buchanan, who he had long disliked, but was angered by Buchanan's decision to assemble an entirely new cabinet. Pierce and his cabinet left office on March 4, 1857, the only time in U.S. history that the original cabinet members all remained for a full four- year term.Wallner (2007), p. 305. Historical reputation After Pierce died in 1869, he mostly passed from the American consciousness, except as one of a series of presidents whose disastrous tenures led to civil war.Gara (1981), p. 180. Historians generally view him as an inept president who was overwhelmed by the problems he faced, and they tend to rank Pierce as one of the worst presidents. Historian Eric Foner says, \\"His administration turned out to be one of the most disastrous in American history. It witnessed the collapse of the party system inherited from the Age of Jackson.\\"Eric Foner, Give Me Liberty! An American History (2006) vol 1 p 413 A 2018 poll of the American Political Science Association’s Presidents and Executive Politics section ranked Pierce as the fifth-worst president. A 2017 C-Span poll of historians ranked Pierce as the third-worst president. The public placed him third-to- last among his peers in C-SPAN surveys (2000 and 2009). The failure of Pierce, as president, to secure sectional conciliation helped bring an end to the dominance of the Democratic Party that had started with Jackson, and led to a period of over seventy years when the Republicans mostly controlled national politics. David Potter concludes that the Ostend Manifesto and the Kansas–Nebraska Act were \\"the two great calamities of the Franklin Pierce administration ... Both brought down an avalanche of public criticism.\\"Potter (1976), p. 192. More important, says Potter, they permanently discredited Manifest Destiny and \\"popular sovereignty\\" as political doctrines. Historian Kenneth Nivison, writing in 2010, takes a more favorable view of Pierce's foreign policy, stating that his expansionism prefaced those of later presidents William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt, who served at a time when America had the military might to make her desires stick. \\"American foreign and commercial policy beginning in the 1890s, which eventually supplanted European colonialism by the middle of the twentieth century, owed much to the paternalism of Jacksonian Democracy cultivated in the international arena by the Presidency of Franklin Pierce.\\" Historian Larry Gara writes: > [Pierce] was president at a time that called for almost superhuman skills, > yet he lacked such skills and never grew into the job to which he had been > elected. His view of the Constitution and the Union was from the Jacksonian > past. He never fully understood the nature or depth of Free Soil sentiment > in the North. He was able to negotiate a reciprocal trade treaty with > Canada, to begin the opening of Japan to western trade, to add land to the > Southwest, and to sign legislation for the creation of an overseas empire > [the Guano Islands Act]. His Cuba and Kansas policies led only to deeper > sectional strife. His support for the Kansas–Nebraska Act and his > determination to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act helped polarize the > sections. Pierce was hard-working and his administration largely untainted > by graft, yet the legacy from those four turbulent years contributed to the > tragedy of secession and civil war. Biographer Roy Nichols argues: > As a national political leader Pierce was an accident. He was honest and > tenacious of his views but, as he made up his mind with difficulty and often > reversed himself before making a final decision, he gave a general > impression of instability. Kind, courteous, generous, he attracted many > individuals, but his attempts to satisfy all factions failed and made him > many enemies. In carrying out his principles of strict construction he was > most in accord with Southerners, who generally had the letter of the law on > their side.

The old Talbot Village was built between 1850 and 1862 because of the generosity of two sisters, Georgina and Mary Talbot.'Talbot Village, A Unique Village in Dorset 1850 - 1993' by Mildred Gillett. Bournemouth Local Studies Publications, 40 Lowther Road, Bournemouth. BH8 8NR. Georgina and Mary divided their year between Surrey and Hinton Wood House on the East Cliff of Bournemouth with their family and it was while living in Bournemouth that the sisters discovered the many poor who were suffering in the region. Between them, they sought to employ the poor to clear the land to build cottages — these were completed between 1850 and 1862. The workers were allowed to stay in the cottages and slowly, Talbot Village began to develop. The original cottages were built on an acre plot and each had a well, animal pens and fruit trees. The residents were charged a rent of between 4 and 5 shillings per week. Georgina Talbot then had 7 almshouses built for the elderly and widowed. The school was built for the village in 1862 and held 68 children. It has since been extended over the years and in 1992 an extension increased the school's capacity to 460 children. Distinctiveness Talbot Village was created to provide housing for the unemployed parishioners of Kinson; it stands apart from model villages such as the Cadbury family's Bournville which were built to house workers, who would then be able to perform their jobs with greater efficiency: the Talbot sisters received no financial return from their residents for having set up the village.Talbot Village Conservation Area, by Margaret butler, for Bournemouth Borough Council, 1995 Georgina Talbot was motivated by the death of her elder brother and her father. She used the money to help the poor of Bournemouth and Kinson because she cared about the area. Georgina did not marry so she would be able to keep in possession of her own money and not have it taken away by husband. Georgina and her family came to Bournemouth when she was a young girl but was shocked by what she saw. There were people were begging on the streets in filth with not enough money to provide for their families.

Farms In addition to the cottages, the village had six farms, each covering about 20 acres, to create employment and trade for the village. Three of the farm buildings survive: Highmoor Farm is still operational, White Farm served as stables into the early years of the 21st century, and Lollipop Farm has been converted into a dwelling house. Slades Farm survives only as the name of a residential district built over its land.Talbot Village Conservation Area, by Margaret Butler, for Bournemouth Borough Council, 1995 The Conservation Area Between 1972 and 1976 most of the buildings and several monuments in the village were listed as being of historic interest by the Department of the Environment.The Listed Building Book W-Z, Bournemouth Town Planning, 1991 In 1975 the Bournemouth Council designated the village as a conservation area, covering the school, church, almshouses, cottages and the surrounding plantation, known as 'Albion Woods', or 'The Backs'.An Alphabetical Index to Roads in Conservation Areas, Bournemouth Planning Office, Summer 1998 the village is also administered by the Talbot Village Trust — which was set up by the Georgina Talbot.

Buchanan, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, took office as the 15th United States president after defeating former President Millard Fillmore of the American Party, and John C. Frémont of the Republican Party in the 1856 presidential election. Buchanan was nominated by the Democratic Party at its 1856 convention, where he defeated both the incumbent President Franklin Pierce and Illinois Senator Stephen A. Douglas. Despite his long experience in government, Buchanan was unable to calm the growing sectional crisis that would divide the nation at the close of his term. Prior to taking office, Buchanan lobbied the Supreme Court to issue a broad ruling in Dred Scott v. Sandford. Though Buchanan hoped that the Court's ruling would end the dispute over slavery in the territories, Buchanan's support of the ruling deeply alienated many Northerners. Buchanan also joined with Southern leaders in attempting to gain the admission of Kansas to the Union as a slave state under the Lecompton Constitution. In the midst of the growing chasm between slave states and free states, the Panic of 1857 struck the nation, causing widespread business failures and high unemployment. Tensions over slavery continued to the end of Buchanan's term. Buchanan had promised in his inaugural address to serve just one term, and with the ongoing national turmoil over slavery, no one asked him to rescind his pledge. Republican nominee Abraham Lincoln, running on a platform devoted to keeping slavery out of all Western territories, defeated the splintered Democratic Party and Constitutional Union candidate John Bell to win the 1860 election. In response to Lincoln's victory, seven Southern states declared their secession from the Union. Buchanan refused to confront the seceded states with military force, but retained control of Fort Sumter. The secession crisis culminated in outbreak of the American Civil War shortly after Buchanan left office. Election of 1856 Results by county, indicating the percentage for the winning candidate. Shades of blue are for Buchanan (Democratic), shades of red are for Frémont (Republican), and shades of yellow are for Fillmore (Know Nothing). After Franklin Pierce won the 1852 presidential election, Buchanan agreed to serve as the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom. Buchanan's service abroad conveniently placed him outside of the country while a debate over the Kansas–Nebraska Act roiled the nation. While Buchanan did not overtly seek the 1856 Democratic presidential nomination, he most deliberately chose not to discourage the movement on his behalf, something that was well within his power on many occasions. The 1856 Democratic National Convention met in June 1856, writing a platform that largely reflected Buchanan's views, including support for the Fugitive Slave Law, an end to anti-slavery agitation, and U.S. \\"ascendancy in the Gulf of Mexico.\\" Buchanan led on the first ballot, boosted by the support of powerful Senators John Slidell, Jesse Bright, and Thomas F. Bayard, who presented Buchanan as an experienced leader who could appeal to the North and South. President Pierce and Senator Stephen A. Douglas also sought the nomination, but Buchanan was selected as the Democratic presidential nominee on the seventeen ballot of the convention. He was joined on the Democratic ticket by John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky. An anti-Buchanan political cartoon from the 1856 election By 1856, the Whig Party, which had long been the main opposition to the Democrats, had collapsed. Buchanan faced not just one but two candidates in the general election: former Whig President Millard Fillmore ran as the American Party (or \\"Know-Nothing\\") candidate, while John C. Frémont ran as the Republican nominee. Much of the private rhetoric of the campaign focused on unfounded rumors regarding Frémont—talk of him as president taking charge of a large army that would support slave insurrections, the likelihood of widespread lynchings of slaves, and whispered hope among slaves for freedom and political equality.Douglas R. Egerton, \\"The Slaves’ Election: Frémont, Freedom, and the Slave Conspiracies of 1856.\\" Civil War History 61#1 (2015): 35-63. Sticking with the convention of the times, Buchanan did not himself campaign, but he wrote letters and pledged to uphold the Democratic platform. In the election, Buchanan carried every slave state except for Maryland, as well as five free states, including his home state of Pennsylvania. He won 45 percent of the popular vote and 174 electoral votes, compared to Frémont's 114 electoral votes and Fillmore's 8 electoral votes. Buchanan's election made him the first and so far only president from Pennsylvania. In his victory speech, Buchanan denounced Republicans, calling the Republican Party a \\"dangerous\\" and \\"geographical\\" party that had unfairly attacked the South. President-elect Buchanan would also state, \\"the object of my administration will be to destroy sectional party, North or South, and to restore harmony to the Union under a national and conservative government.\\" Inauguration Photograph of James Buchanan's 1857 presidential inauguration at the U.S. Capitol; earliest known inaugural photograph. Buchanan was inaugurated as the nation's 15th president on March 4, 1857, on the East Portico of the United States Capitol. Chief Justice Roger Taney administered the Oath of office. This is the first inauguration ceremony known to have been photographed. In his inaugural address, Buchanan committed himself to serving only one term. He also spoke critically about the growing divisions over slavery and its status in the territories, stating, Furthermore, Buchanan argued that a federal slave code should protect the rights of slave-owners in any federal territory. He alluded to a pending Supreme Court case, Dred Scott v. Sandford, which he stated would permanently settle the issue of slavery. In fact, Buchanan already knew the outcome of the case, and had even played a part in its disposition. Historians agree that the address caused more problems than it solved.Michael L. Carrafiello, \\"Diplomatic Failure: James Buchanan’S Inaugural Address.\\" Pennsylvania History 77.2 (2010): 145-165 online. Administration President Buchanan and his Cabinet From left to right: Jacob Thompson, Lewis Cass, John B. Floyd, James Buchanan, Howell Cobb, Isaac Toucey, Joseph Holt and Jeremiah S. Black, (c. 1859) As his inauguration approached, Buchanan sought to establish a harmonious cabinet that would not fall victim to the in-fighting that had plagued Andrew Jackson's top officials. One of his closest advisers—who was named ambassador to Britain—was Jehu Glancy Jones.Michael Todd Landis, \\"Old Buck's Lieutenant: Glancy Jones, James Buchanan, and the Antebellum Northern Democracy.\\" Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography 140.2 (2016): 183-210. Online Buchanan sought to be the clear leader of the cabinet, and chose men who would agree with his views. Anticipating that his administration would concentrate on foreign policy and that Buchanan himself would largely direct foreign policy, he appointed the aging Lewis Cass as Secretary of State. Cass would become marginalized in Buchanan's administration, with Buchanan and Assistant Secretary of State John Appleton instead directing foreign affairs. In filling out his cabinet, Buchanan chose four Southerners and three Northerners, one of whom was Secretary of the Navy Isaac Toucey, widely considered to be a \\"doughface,\\" or Southern-sympathizer. Aside from the nearly-senile Cass, only Attorney General Jeremiah S. Black lacked partiality towards the South, but Black despised abolitionists and free-soilers. Battling Stephen Douglas of Illinois Buchanan's appointment of Southerners and Southern sympathizers alienated many in the North, and his failure to appoint any followers of Stephen Douglas divided the party.David E. Meerse, \\"Origins of the Buchanan- Douglas Feud Reconsidered.\\" Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society 67#2 (1974): 154-174 online. Though Buchanan owed his nomination to Douglas's decision to withdraw from consideration at the 1856 Democratic convention, he disliked Douglas personally and favored Jesse D. Bright, who hoped to unseat Douglas as the leader of the Midwestern Democrats. Outside of the cabinet, Buchanan left in place many of Pierce's appointments, but removed a disproportionate number of Northerners who had ties to Pierce or Douglas. Buchanan quickly alienated his vice president, Breckinridge, and the latter played little role in the Buchanan administration. Buchanan and his allies in Congress worked systematically to undermine Douglas. By 1860 they had weakened his influence in the Party; they had stripped away his patronage, and removed him from the powerful chairmanship of the Committee on Territories. He was much weaker inside the Senate than before.Craig L. Kautz, \\"Beneficial Politics: John Slidell and the Cuban Bill of 1859\\" Louisiana Studies (1974) 13#2 pp 119-129. Nevertheless, Douglas had a powerful base outside Washington in the northern wing of the Democratic Party that was increasingly hostile to the president and his southern supporters. The battle with Lincoln in 1858 drew national attention, with Democrats reading Douglas's debates and hailing him as the victor, thereby allowing Douglas to emerge as the favorite to win the party nomination for president in 1860.Allen C. Guelzo, \\"Houses Divided: Lincoln, Douglas, and the Political Landscape of 1858.\\" Journal of American History 94.2 (2007): 391-417. OnlineRichard Allen Heckman, \\"Out-of-State Influences and the Lincoln-Douglas Campaign of 1858.\\" Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society 59#1 (1966): 30-47 online. Judicial appointments Buchanan appointed one Justice to the Supreme Court of the United States, Nathan Clifford of Maine. Clifford had served with Buchanan in James K. Polk's cabinet, and his views on major issues largely aligned with those of Buchanan. Clifford succeeded Benjamin Robbins Curtis, who had resigned in protest of the Dred Scott decision. Clifford's nomination was opposed by many Northern senators, but he won confirmation in a 26-to-23 vote. A second vacancy arose after the death of Peter Vivian Daniel in 1860, and Buchanan nominated Attorney General Black to fill the opening. In the aftermath of the election of 1860, Black fell just one vote short of confirmation, leaving one Supreme Court seat open as Buchanan left office. Aside from Clifford, Buchanan appointed only seven other Article III federal judges, all to United States district courts. Dred Scott case The balance of free and slave states in 1858, after the admission of Minnesota In the aftermath of the Mexican–American War, a new debate had arisen over the status of slavery in the western territories. While abolitionism had not emerged as a strong force, many Northerners saw slavery as a moral blight and opposed the extension of slavery into the territories. Many Southerners, meanwhile, were deeply offended by the moral assault on the institution of slavery and feared that an attack on slavery in the territories could lead to an attack on slavery in the South. The Compromise of 1850 had temporarily defused the situation, but every Northern defiance of the Fugitive Slave Act (passed as part of the compromise) inflamed tensions in the South. The 1852 publication of Uncle Tom's Cabin further divided opinion. In 1854, the Kansas–Nebraska Act repealed the Missouri Compromise, which had excluded slavery from territories north of the 36°30′ parallel. Each new state would instead decide upon the status of slavery under the concept of popular sovereignty. The bill was very unpopular in the North, and its passage contributed to the collapse of the Whig Party and the rise of the Republican Party, which consisted almost entirely of Northerners opposed to the expansion of slavery into the territories. Though few Republicans sought to abolish slavery in the South, Southerners saw the very existence of the Republican Party as an affront, and the Republicans made little effort to appeal to the South with any of their other policies, such as support for high tariffs and federally-funded internal improvements. Upon taking office, Buchanan hoped to not only end the tensions over slavery but also vanquish what he saw as a dangerously-sectional Republican Party. The most pressing issue regarding slavery concerned its status of in the territories, and whether popular sovereignty meant that territorial legislatures could bar the entrance of slaves. Seeing an opening in a pending Supreme Court case to settle the issue, President-Elect Buchanan had involved himself in the decision-making process of the Court in the months leading up to his own inauguration. Two days after Buchanan's inauguration, Chief Justice Taney delivered the Dred Scott decision, which asserted that Congress had no constitutional power to exclude slavery in the territories. Prior to his inauguration, Buchanan had written to Justice John Catron in January 1857, inquiring about the outcome of the case and suggesting that a broader decision would be more prudent. Catron, who was from Tennessee, replied on February 10 that the Supreme Court's Southern majority would decide against Scott, but would likely have to publish the decision on narrow grounds if there was no support from the Court's northern justices—unless Buchanan could convince his fellow Pennsylvanian, Justice Robert Cooper Grier, to join the majority. Buchanan hoped that a broad Supreme Court decision protecting slavery in the territories could lay the issue to rest once and for all, allowing the country to focus on other issues, including the possible annexation of Cuba and the acquisition of more Mexican territory. So Buchanan wrote to Grier and successfully prevailed upon him, allowing the majority leverage to issue a broad-ranging decision that transcended the specific circumstances of Scott's case to declare the Missouri Compromise unconstitutional. When the Court's decision in Dred Scott was issued two days after Buchanan's inauguration, Republicans began spreading word that Taney had revealed to Buchanan the forthcoming result. Buchanan's strong public support of the decision earned him and his party the enmity of many Northerners from the outset of his presidency. Panic of 1857 and economic policy The Panic of 1857 began in the middle of that year, ushered in by the sequential collapse of fourteen hundred state banks and five thousand businesses. While the South escaped largely unscathed, Northern cities saw numerous unemployed men and women take to the streets to beg. Reflecting his Jacksonian background, Buchanan's response was \\"reform not relief\\". While the government was \\"without the power to extend relief\\", it would continue to pay its debts in specie, and while it would not curtail public works, none would be added. Buchanan urged the states to restrict the banks to a credit level of $3 to $1 of specie, and discouraged the use of federal or state bonds as security for bank note issues. Though the economy recovered by 1859, the panic inflamed sectional tensions, as many Northerners blamed the Southern-backed Tariff of 1857 (passed during Pierce's last day in office) for the panic. Southerners, as well as Buchanan, instead blamed the over-speculation of Northern bankers. In part due to the worsened economy, by the time Buchanan left office the federal deficit stood at $17 million, higher than it had been when Buchanan took office. Throughout 1858 and 1859, Congress continued to debate perennial issues such as the tariff and infrastructure spending. Southern and Western congressmen succeeded in retaining the low rates of the Tariff of 1857 until 1861. Many in Congress pushed for the construction of a transcontinental railroad, but its construction was prevented by a combination of Southern and New England congressmen. Among the pieces of legislation that Buchanan vetoed were the Homestead Act, which would have given 160 acres of public land to settlers who remained on settled land for five years, and the Morrill Act, which would have granted public lands to establish land-grant colleges. Buchanan argued that these acts were beyond the power of the federal government as established by the Constitution. Following the secession of several Southern states, Congress passed the Morrill Tariff, significantly raising rates. Despite his long opposition to higher tariffs, Buchanan signed the tariff into law on March 2, 1861. The Morrill Tariff raised the tariff to the highest levels seen since the 1840s, and passage of the law marked a new period of protectionist tariffs that would continue long after Buchanan left office. Utah War Utah had been settled by Mormons in the decades preceding Buchanan's presidency, and under the leadership of Brigham Young the Mormons had grown increasingly hostile to federal intervention. Young harassed federal officers and discouraged outsiders from settling in the Salt Lake City area, and in September 1857 the Utah Territorial Militia perpetrated the Mountain Meadows massacre against Arkansans headed for California. Buchanan was also personally offended by the polygamous behavior of Young. Accepting the wildest rumors and believing the Mormons to be in open rebellion against the United States, Buchanan sent the army in November 1857 to replace Young as governor with the non-Mormon Alfred Cumming. While the Mormons' had frequently defied federal authority, some question whether Buchanan's action was a justifiable or prudent response to uncorroborated reports. Complicating matters, Young's notice of his replacement was not delivered because the Pierce administration had annulled the Utah mail contract. After Young reacted to the military action by mustering a two-week expedition destroying wagon trains, oxen, and other Army property, Buchanan dispatched Thomas L. Kane as a private agent to negotiate peace. The mission succeeded, the new governor was shortly placed in office, and the Utah War ended. The president granted amnesty to all inhabitants who would respect the authority of the government, and moved the federal troops to a nonthreatening distance for the balance of his administration. Though he continued to practice polygamy, Young largely accepted federal authority after the conclusion of the Utah War. Bleeding Kansas After the passage of the Kansas–Nebraska Act in 1854, two competing governments had been formed in Kansas Territory. The anti-slavery settlers organized a government in Topeka, while pro-slavery settlers established a seat of government in Lecompton, Kansas. For Kansas to be admitted as a state, a constitution had to be submitted to Congress with the approval of a majority of residents. Under President Pierce, a series of violent confrontations known as \\"Bleeding Kansas\\" occurred as supporters of the two governments clashed. The situation in Kansas was watched closely throughout the country, and some in Georgia and Mississippi advocated secession should Kansas be admitted as a free state. Buchanan himself did not particularly care whether or not Kansas entered as a slave state, and instead sought to admit Kansas as a state as soon as possible since it would likely tilt towards the Democratic Party. Rather than restarting the process and establishing one territorial government, Buchanan chose to recognize the pro-slavery Lecompton government. Historians have taken one of two approaches to the Kansas policy. Allan Nevins presents a \\"melodramatic\\" interpretation. He argues that Buchanan honestly wanted a constitution ratified by genuine residents. His firmness weakened in the face of pro-southern factions in his cabinet and party and he retreated. Roy Nichols takes a \\"legalist\\" approach arguing that Buchanan only submitted one issue, slavery itself to the voters. But he became distracted by the financial panic of 1857 and accepted the Lecompton Constitution. Nevins and Nichols agree on Buchanan's weak leadership, but offer subtle variations on how Buchanan tried to hold the middle ground by accepting a de facto slavery settlement. Upon taking office, Buchanan appointed Robert J. Walker to replace John W. Geary as territorial governor of Kansas, with the mission of reconciling the settler factions and approving a constitution. Walker, who was from the slave state of Mississippi, was expected to assist the pro-slavery faction in gaining approval of a new constitution. Buchanan overcame Walker's initial reluctance to accept the appointment by persuading Walker that a successful resolution to the Kansas issue could catapult Walker to the presidency in 1860. Buchanan also promised Walker that Kansas would hold a free and fair referendum on any state constitution. Shortly after arriving in Kansas, Walker remarked that an \\"isothermal line\\" (i.e. the climate) had made Kansas unsuitable to slavery, angering pro-slavery leaders in Kansas and across the United States. In October 1857, the Lecompton government organized territorial elections that resulted in a pro-slavery legislature, despite Walker's discovery of fraud in several counties. The convention framed a pro- slavery state constitution (known as the \\"Lecompton Constitution\\") and, rather than risking a referendum, sent it directly to Buchanan. Though eager for Kansas statehood, even Buchanan was forced to reject the entrance of Kansas without a state constitutional referendum, and he dispatched federal agents to bring about a compromise. The Lecompton government agreed to a limited referendum in which Kansas would vote not on the constitution overall, but rather merely on whether or not Kansas would allow slavery after becoming a state. The anti-slavery Topeka government boycotted the December 1857 referendum, in which slavery overwhelmingly won the approval of those who did vote. A month later, the Topeka government held its own referendum in which voters overwhelmingly rejected the Lecompton Constitution. Despite the protests of Walker and two former governors of Kansas, Buchanan decided to accept the Lecompton Constitution. In a December 1857 meeting with Stephen Douglas, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Territories and an important Northern Democrat, Buchanan demanded that all Democrats support the administration's position of admitting Kansas under the Lecompton Constitution. Facing re-election and outraged by the perceived fraud in Kansas, Douglas broke with Buchanan and attacked the Lecompton Constitution. On February 2, Buchanan transmitted the Lecompton Constitution to Congress. He also transmitted a message that attacked the \\"revolutionary government\\" in Topeka, conflating them with the Mormons in Utah. Buchanan made every effort to secure congressional approval, offering favors, patronage appointments, and even cash for votes. The Lecompton Constitution won the approval of the Senate in March, but a combination of Know-Nothings, Republicans, and Northern Democrats defeated the bill in the House. Rather than accepting defeat, Buchanan backed the English Bill, which offered Kansans immediate statehood and vast public lands in exchange for accepting the Lecompton Constitution. Despite the continued opposition of Douglas, the English bill won passage in both houses of Congress. Despite congressional approval of the constitution, Kansas voters strongly rejected the Lecompton Constitution in an August 1858 referendum. Southerners were outraged that the Lecompton Constitution had been defeated by a supposed Northern conspiracy led by Douglas, while many Northerners now saw Buchanan as a tool of the Southern \\"Slave Power.\\" Anti- slavery delegates won a majority of the elections to the 1859 state constitutional convention, and Kansas won admission as a free state in the final months of Buchanan's presidency. Guerrilla warfare in the state would continue throughout Buchanan's presidency and extend into 1860s, when it became a relatively minor theater of the wider American Civil War. The battle over Kansas escalated into a battle for control of the Democratic Party. On one side were Buchanan, most Southern Democrats, and \\"doughface\\" Northern Democrats; on the other side were Douglas and most Northern Democrats, as well as a few Southerners. Douglas's faction continued to support the doctrine of popular sovereignty, while Buchanan insisted that Democrats respect the Dred Scott decision and its repudiation of federal interference with slavery in the territories. The struggle lasted the remainder of Buchanan's presidency. Buchanan used his patronage powers to remove Douglas' sympathizers in favor of pro-administration Democrats. 1858 mid-term elections Douglas's Senate term ended in 1859, so the Illinois legislature elected in 1858 would determine whether Douglas would win re-election. The Senate election was the primary issue of the legislative election, marked by the Lincoln-Douglas debates between Douglas and the Republican candidate, former Congressman Abraham Lincoln. Buchanan, working through federal patronage appointees in Illinois, ran candidates for the legislature in competition with both the Republicans and the Douglas Democrats. This could easily have thrown the election to the Republicans—which showed the depth of Buchanan's animosity toward Douglas. In his 1858 re-election bid, Douglas defeated Lincoln, who warned that the Supreme Court would soon bar states from excluding slavery. As part of his campaign, Douglas laid out his \\"Freeport Doctrine,\\" which held that territorial legislatures retained the de facto right to exclude slavery despite the Dred Scott decision, because said legislatures could refuse to recognize slavery as property. In the 1858 elections, Douglas forces took control of the Democratic Party throughout the North, except in Buchanan's home state of Pennsylvania, leaving Buchanan with a narrow base of Southern supporters. However, the Freeport Doctrine further diminished Douglas's support in the South, which was already in decline following his refusal to support the Lecompton Constitution. The division between Northern and Southern Democrats helped the Republicans win a plurality in the House in the elections of 1858. While campaigning for a Republican congressional candidate in New York, Republican Senator William Seward described the party struggle between Republicans and Democrats as part of a larger \\"irrepressible conflict\\" between systems of free and slave labor. Though Seward quickly walked back his remarks and relatively few Northerners actually sought the immediate abolition of slavery in the South, Seward's remarks and the subsequent Republican victories in the 1858 elections caused many in the South to believe that the election of a Republican president would lead to the abolition of slavery. The election losses served as a Northern rebuke to the Buchanan administration, and Republican control of the House allowed Republicans to block much of Buchanan's agenda in the second half of his term. Continuing tensions over slavery Following the 1858 elections, Senator Jefferson Davis of Mississippi and fellow Southern radicals sought to pass a federal slave code that would protect slavery in the territories, thereby closing the loophole contemplated by Douglas's Freeport Doctrine. In February 1859, as debate over the federal slave code began, Davis and other Southerners announced that they would leave the party if the 1860 party platform included popular sovereignty, while Douglas and his supporters likewise stated that they would bolt the party if the party platform included a federal slave code. Despite this continuing debate over slavery in the territories, the decline of Kansas as a major issue allowed unionists to remain a powerful force in the South. In October 1859, abolitionist John Brown led raid on a federal armory in Harpers Ferry, Virginia, in hopes of initiating a slave revolt. Brown's plan failed miserably, and the majority of his party was killed or captured. In the aftermath of the attack, Republican leaders denied any connection to Brown, who was executed in December 1859 by the state of Virginia. Though few leaders in the North approved of Brown's actions, Southerners were outraged, and many accused Republican leaders such as Seward of having masterminded the raid. In his December 1859 annual message to Congress, Buchanan characterized the raid as part of an \\"open war by the North to abolish slavery in the South,\\" and he called for the establishment of a federal slave code. Senate hearings led by Senator James Murray Mason of Virginia cleared the Republican Party of responsibility for the raid after a long investigation, but Southern Congressmen remained suspicious of their Republican colleagues. Foreign policy Buchanan entered the White House with an ambitious foreign policy centered around establishing U.S. hegemony over Central America at the expense of Great Britain. He hoped to re-negotiate the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty, which he viewed as a mistake that limited U.S. influence in the region. He also sought to establish American protectorates over the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Sonora, partly to serve as a destination for Mormons.Mackinnon, William P. Mackinnon, \\"Hammering Utah, Squeezing Mexico, and Coveting Cuba: James Buchanan's White House Intrigues.\\" Utah Historical Quarterly (2012), 80#2, pp 132-151 Aware of the decrepit state of the Spanish Empire, he hoped to finally achieve his long-term goal of acquiring Cuba, where state slavery still flourished. After long negotiations with the British, he convinced them to agree to cede the Bay Islands to Honduras and the Mosquito Coast to Nicaragua. However, Buchanan's ambitions in Cuba and Mexico were blocked in the House of Representatives, where the anti-slavery forces strenuously opposed any move to acquire new slave territory.Craig L. Kautz, \\"Beneficial Politics: John Slidell and the Cuban Bill of 1859.\\" Louisiana Studies (1974) 13#2 pp 119-129. Buchanan also considered buying Alaska from the Russian Empire, possibly as a colony for Mormon settlers, but the U.S. and Russia were unable to agree upon a price. In China, the U.S. was neutral in the Second Opium War of 1856–58. Buchanan appointed William Bradford Reed as Minister to China in 1857–58. Reed helped Buchanan win in 1856 by persuading old-line Whigs to support a Democrat. Reed's goal in China was to negotiate a new treaty that would win for the United States the privileges Britain and France had forced on China in the war. Reed did well. The Treaty of Tientsin (1858) granted American diplomats the right to reside in Peking, reduced tariff levels for American goods, and guaranteed the free exercise of religion by foreigners in China. The treaty helped set the roots of what later became Washington's Open Door policy. Foster M. Farley, \\"William B. Reed: President Buchanan's Minister to China 1857-1858.\\" Pennsylvania History 37.3 (1970): 269-280.

( Covode committee Buchanan and his allies awarded no-bid contracts to political supporters, used government money to wage political campaigns and bribe judges, and sold government property for less than its worth to cronies. According to historian Michael F. Holt, the Buchanan administration was \\"undoubtedly the most corrupt [administration] before the Civil War and one of the most corrupt in American history.\\" In March 1860, the House created the Covode Committee to investigate the administration for evidence of corruption, bribery, and extortion. The committee, with three Republicans and two Democrats, was accused by Buchanan's supporters of being nakedly partisan; they also charged its chairman, Republican Congressman John Covode, with acting on a personal grudge due to Buchanan's veto of a land grant bill for agricultural colleges. Despite this criticism, the Democratic committee members, as well as Democratic witnesses, were equally enthusiastic in their pursuit of Buchanan as were the Republicans. The committee was unable to establish grounds for impeaching Buchanan; however, the majority report issued on June 17 exposed corruption and abuse of power among members of his cabinet, as well as allegations (if not impeachable evidence) from the Republican members of the Committee, that Buchanan had attempted to bribe members of Congress in connection with the Lecompton constitution. The Democratic report, issued separately the same day, pointed out that evidence was scarce, but did not refute the allegations; one of the Democratic members, Rep. James Robinson, stated publicly that he agreed with the Republican report even though he did not sign it. Buchanan claimed to have \\"passed triumphantly through this ordeal\\" with complete vindication. Nonetheless, Republican operatives distributed thousands of copies of the Covode Committee report throughout the nation as campaign material in that year's presidential election. Election of 1860 John C. Breckinridge, Vice President of the United States under Buchanan The 1860 Democratic National Convention convened in April 1860 in Charleston, South Carolina. Buchanan had decided to stick to his pledge to serve just one term, but his administration actively sought a successor who would uphold his policies. Stephen Douglas had emerged as the most popular Northern Democratic leader after the 1858 elections, but he had alienated Buchanan and much of the South with his stance on slavery in the territories. Some Southern Democrats, especially those from the Deep South, preferred a Republican president to Douglas because the election of a Republican president would encourage secession. After a long and acrimonious fight, the convention adopted a platform favoring Douglas's conception of popular sovereignty and rejecting a federal slave code. Seven Southern delegation chairmen walked out on the convention in reaction to the party platform. After Southern leaders bolted from the convention, Caleb Cushing, a Buchanan ally who had won election as chair of the convention, ruled that the presidential ballot would require a two-thirds majority of all delegates (including the bolters), meaning that the nominee would have to win support from five-sixths of the delegates present. After fifty-seven ballots, all of which Douglas led, the convention adjourned with plans to reconvene in June in Baltimore, Maryland. After re-convening, most of the remaining Southern delegates, as well as some Northern delegates loyal to Buchanan, left the convention after losing a vote to re-seat the delegates that had bolted in Charleston. The remaining delegates nominated Douglas for president. Douglas preferred Alexander H. Stephens as his running mate, but left the decision to the remaining Southern delegates, who eventually picked former Governor Herschel Johnson of Georgia. The delegates who had bolted from the Charleston and Baltimore conventions met elsewhere in Baltimore. After stating that he did not believe that the South should secede if Republicans won the 1860 election, Vice President Breckinridge was nominated on the first ballot of the convention. Senator Joseph Lane of Oregon was nominated as Breckinridge's running mate. Buchanan and former President Franklin Pierce both endorsed Breckinridge and his platform, which called for the federal protection of slavery in the territories. A group of former Whigs opposed to both Breckinridge and the Republicans, and unable to reach an accommodation with Douglas, formed the Constitutional Union Party and nominated John Bell of Tennessee for president and Edward Everett of Massachusetts for vice president. The nascent party emphasized unionism and sought to push aside the issue of slavery. Though the party initially hoped to compete in both the North and the South, some Constitutional Unionists in the South endorsed a federal slave code, which destroyed the party's support in the North. The 1860 Republican National Convention opened with five major candidates: Abraham Lincoln, William Seward, Salmon P. Chase of Ohio, Simon Cameron of Pennsylvania, and Edward Bates of Missouri. Despite Seward's lead on the first two ballots, Lincoln emerged as the party's nominee on the third ballot. Lincoln's candidacy was boosted by the widely-held view that his reputation for honesty and moderation made him a strong candidate, especially in key Northern swing states like Indiana and Illinois. For vice president, the Republicans nominated Hannibal Hamlin, a former Democrat from Maine who maintained warm relations with both Lincoln and Seward. Republicans, including Seward, rallied to Lincoln as did many former Whigs. Lincoln argued for the containment of slavery to the Southern states, but promised that Republicans would not seek to abolish slavery in the South itself. With four major candidates in the field, Buchanan hoped that not one candidate would win an electoral vote majority and the election would be thrown to the House. Results by county, indicating the percentage for the winning candidate. Shades of red represent Lincoln's support, shades of blue represent Douglas's support, shades of green represent Breckinridge's support, and shades of yellow represent Bell's support. The 1860 election was essentially two races; in the North, Lincoln competed with Douglas for votes, while in the South, Breckinridge and Bell garnered the most support. Like his successful Whig predecessors, Lincoln largely refrained from campaigning after the convention, instead leaving that to others in the party. In his silence, Lincoln failed to refute the charge of Southern radicals that he hoped to abolish slavery. During the summer and fall of 1860, Southern governors corresponded about potentially seceding from the union, and Buchanan did little to denounce secessionists. Douglas, on the other hand, focused much of his campaign on attacking secessionists, who he worried would attempt to seize control of the federal government in the aftermath of a Lincoln victory. As Breckinridge and Bell lacked support in the North, the defeat of Lincoln required the victory of Douglas in at least some Northern states, but Buchanan remained focused on defeating Douglas. Some anti-Republican leaders attempted to form a fusion ticket in the North, but they achieved little success outside of New Jersey. With the Democrats divided, Lincoln won the 1860 election with a plurality of the popular vote and a majority of the electoral vote. Lincoln won virtually no support in the South, but his strong performance over Douglas in the North gave him a majority of the electoral vote. Breckinridge won most of the South, Bell won Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee, and Douglas won Missouri and three electoral votes in New Jersey. Despite Lincoln's presidential victory, Republicans failed to win a majority in the House or Senate, and the Supreme Court membership remained largely the same as it had been when it issued the Dred Scott decision. Thus, despite the election of a Republican president, slavery in the South faced no immediate danger. As early as October, the army's Commanding General, Winfield Scott, warned Buchanan that Lincoln's election would likely cause at least seven states to secede. He recommended that massive amounts of federal troops and artillery be deployed to those states to protect federal property, and warned that few reinforcements were available. Buchanan, however, distrusted Scott (the two had long been political adversaries) and ignored his recommendations. After Lincoln's election, Buchanan directed Secretary of War Floyd to reinforce southern forts with such provisions, arms and men as were available; however, Floyd convinced him to revoke the order. Secession Compromise attempts Columbia as Little Bo Peep; her lost sheep are the Southern states. Buchanan as \\"dog buck\\" tries in vain to herd states back into the Union. With Lincoln's victory, talk of secession and disunion reached a boiling point. A Cincinnati newspaper wrote, \\"the doctrine of secession is anarchy. If any minority have the right to break up the government at pleasure, because they have not had their way, there is an end of all government. In his annual message, delivered on December 3, 1860, Buchanan blamed the crisis entirely on Northerners and their anti-slavery agitation. He also argued that the Constitution made no provision for secession and that such an act would be unconstitutional. He stated that a \\"revolution\\" is justifiable in some instances, but argued that the South should wait for an \\"overt or dangerous\\" act before resorting to such a drastic action. Despite his opposition to secession, Buchanan argued that the president had no power to coerce states to remain in the Union, though he did state the president could defend federal property in seceding states. Finally, Buchanan asked Congress to call a convention of states to propose a constitutional amendment that would recognize slaves as property throughout the United States. His address was sharply criticized both by the North, for its refusal to stop secession, and the South, for denying its right to secede. Historian Jean H. Baker explains Buchanan's behavior in terms of his Southern leanings, his long‐standing friendship with Southerners, and his choice of strong Southern personalities for his cabinet. She suggests that if it had not been for Joseph Holt, Edwin Stanton, and Jeremiah Black, Buchanan might have recognized the Confederate States of America.Jean H. Baker, \\"The South Has Been Wronged: James Buchanan and the Secession Crisis,\\" in James Buchanan and the Coming of the Civil War, ed. by John W. Quist and Michael J. Birkner, (2013) pp 165-182. During the lame duck session of the 36th Congress, the Senate established the Committee of Thirteen in an attempt to defuse the crisis. The committee consisted of a mix of Northern Democrats, Southern Democrats, and Republicans. Senator John J. Crittenden of Kentucky proposed a package of constitutional amendments known as the Crittenden Compromise. The compromise would protect slavery in federal territories, current and future, south of the 36°30′ parallel. Congress would be forbidden from abolishing slavery in any state or interfering with the domestic slave trade. President- elect Lincoln refused to acquiesce to any extension of slavery into the territories, as he feared that the compromise would encourage Southern leaders to attempt to annex new territory South of the 36°30′ parallel in order to extend slavery. He also believed that adoption of the Crittenden Compromise would set a precedent through which Southern leaders could use the threat of secession to extract concessions. On Lincoln's direction, a majority of the Republicans on the committee opposed the Crittenden Compromise, and it was defeated by a combination of Republican and Southern votes. Crittenden nonetheless brought his package to the Senate floor, where was defeated in a 25-to-23 vote on January 16, 1861. thumbupright=1.11861 United States Secession Crisis map. Legend: alt=1861 Map of U.S. states and territories showing two phases of secession. In 1850, Southern extremists had called the Nashville Convention in an attempt to organize the simultaneous secession of Southern states. In 1860, pro-secession leaders pursued a state-by-state strategy, hoping to trigger a chain reaction by leading states to secede one-by-one. A minority of leaders in the Deep South, including Alexander Stephens, opposed secession before Lincoln made a move that would threaten slavery in the Southern states. However, the wide popularity of secession in the Deep South precluded delay until after Lincoln took office. As Congress scrambled to devise a compromise acceptable to North and South, the first Southern state seceded. South Carolina, long the most radical Southern state, declared its secession on December 20, 1860. The state ordnance of secession accused the North of having \\"assumed the right to decide upon the propriety of our domestic institutions\\" and also declared that the Republican Party believed that \\"a war must be waged against Slavery until it shall cease throughout the United States.\\" After declaring its own secession, South Carolina sent commissioners to the other Southern states. By February 1, 1861, another six states had seceded. Conventions in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Florida overwhelmingly voted to secede, while unionists in Alabama and Georgia put up a stronger, but still unsuccessful, fight. In a referendum, two-thirds of Texans also voted to secede, despite the opposition of long-time Texas leader Sam Houston. The other eight slave states rejected secession, though North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, and Arkansas would later secede during Lincoln's presidency. The seceded states organized into the Confederate States of America, and Jefferson Davis was elected as the Confederacy's first president on February 9. After trying in vain to convince Lincoln to publicly support a constitutional convention or a national referendum on the Crittenden Compromise, Buchanan sent a special message to Congress, asking it to authorize a referendum or find some other method of compromise that would allay the fears of the South. Leaders in both the North and South competed for the allegiance of the upper South, and both attempted to project an image of moderation. The House of Representatives established the Committee of Thirty-Three to help foster a compromise to prevent more states from seceding. Charles Francis Adams Sr. put forth a proposal to admit New Mexico as a slave state, but the lack of slaves in that territory led most congressmen to believe that it would become a de facto free state. With the support of Seward and Lincoln, the Committee of Thirty-Three put forth a resolution to repeal all state personal liberty laws, which were designed to make enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act more difficult. The committee also proposed the Corwin Amendment, which would bar Congress from interfering with slavery in the states. A significant number of Republicans refused to support the Corwin Amendment, but it passed both of the houses of Congress and was proposed to the states for ratification. On February 4, delegates convened from most states outside of the Deep South convened in Washington for the Peace Conference of 1861, which was chaired by former President John Tyler. The convention proposed a solution similar to the Crittenden Compromise, with the major change being that slavery would be protected only in current territories below the 36°30′ parallel. Republican opposition to the Peace Conference's proposal killed its chances, and its proposals were rejected by Congress. The Corwin Amendment would never be ratified by the requisite number of states, but as Congress did not set a time limit for its ratification, the amendment is still technically pending. Fort Sumter With all compromise efforts failing, and with several Southern states had seceded, Buchanan's final days in office would be dominated by the issue of federal forts in the South, especially Fort Sumter. All sides recognized that the status of Fort Sumter and two other forts located near Charleston could decide whether or not the South would secede peacefully. As long as they remained under federal control, they would be a hated symbol of Northern power, but a Southern attack on them would incite Northern public opinion and possibly spark a civil war. Because whichever side that fired the first shot would look like the aggressor and pay a price in the crucial border states, many Southerners hoped to persuade Buchanan to peacefully surrender the forts. Shortly after Lincoln's election, Buchanan and Secretary of War Floyd had appointed Major Robert Anderson to command Fort Sumter and the other two nearby federal installations. Buchanan ordered Anderson to hold the forts while avoiding any act that would provoke aggression. On December 27, Anderson evacuated from the more vulnerable Fort Moultrie. Meeting with several Southern leaders, Buchanan acknowledged that Anderson's actions had gone against his orders, but he refused to remove Anderson or surrender the forts. Outraged, Secretary of War Floyd, who himself was from Virginia, resigned. Buchanan considered ordering Anderson to return to Fort Moultrie, but his Northern cabinet members, who now made up a majority of the cabinet, threatened to resign. Buchanan instead composed a public message in which he stated that he would do all within his power to defend Fort Sumter. On January 5, 1861, Buchanan decided to reinforce Fort Sumter, sending the Star of the West with 250 men and supplies. However, Buchanan failed to ask Major Anderson to provide covering fire for the ship, and it was forced to return North without delivering troops or supplies. Following the expedition, the last of Buchanan's Southern cabinet members resigned. The Buchanan administration debated ways to reinforce Fort Sumter, but Anderson did not ask for supplies and Buchanan was content to deliver the issue of Fort Sumter to President Lincoln. In February, South Carolina became part of the Confederate States of America. The Confederate Congress authorized President Davis to take the fort by any means necessary, but the Confederates would not strike until after the end of Buchanan's presidency. On March 3, a message from Anderson reached Buchanan stating that Fort Sumter's supplies were running low. The following day, Buchanan was succeeded by Lincoln, who was left to deal with the crisis that eventually became the American Civil War. States admitted to the Union Three new states were admitted to the Union while Buchanan was in office: * Minnesota – May 11, 1858 * Oregon – February 14, 1859 * Kansas – January 29, 1861 Historical reputation The day before his death, Buchanan predicted that \\"history will vindicate my memory\\". Historians have defied that prediction and criticize Buchanan for his passivity as the debate over slavery tore at and disrupted the country in the late 1850s. In terms of his legacy to American history, historian Michael Todd Landis Links and closely to his top advisor Jehu Glancy Jones: :Leading Northern Democrats such as Jones and Buchanan were not romantic defenders of working men, as some scholars have claimed; nor were they moderates striving to save the Union from extreme sectionalism. Rather, they were proslavery activists whose willful actions had direct and disastrous effects on the nation. Their policies enraged free-state voters and caused the fatal split in the Democratic Party that resulted in Lincoln’s election, which, in turn, triggered disunion. They were culpable and responsible—a fact that should not be forgotten or overlooked.Landis, 2016 When asked to rank the best and worst presidents, Buchanan is consistently placed among the worst. Many consider him as the worst president in American history, for during his administration, the Union broke apart, and when he left office, civil war threatened. A 2017 C-SPAN survey ranked him the least effective U.S. president of all-time. The survey asked 91 presidential historians to rank the 43 former presidents (including then-out-going president Barack Obama) in various categories to come up with a composite score, resulting in an overall ranking; Buchanan was ranked 43rd. His rankings in the various categories of this most recent poll were: public persuasion (43), crisis leadership (43), economic management (43), moral authority (43), international relations (43), administrative skills (41), relations with congress (42), vision/setting an agenda (43), pursued equal justice for all (43), performance with context of times (43). A 2018 poll of the American Political Science Association’s Presidents and Executive Politics section ranked Buchanan as the second-worst president. A 2006 poll of historians ranked Buchanan's failure to prevent the Civil War as the worst mistake ever made by a sitting president. Buchanan biographer Philip Klein explains the challenges Buchanan faced: Biographer Jean Baker is less charitable to Buchanan: Quite apart from the moralistic evaluations of Buchanan's failures, historians have recently been asking new questions about exactly how his administration worked. Michael L. Carrafiello argues: :In the 1990s, however, a group of eminent antebellum historians declared that much more work needed to be done on Buchanan and his presidency. History’s verdict on Buchanan, they said, cannot merely be that he was the antithesis of Lincoln. They suggested a number of questions on Buchanan that remained to be answered including “How did he define his presidential role?” and “What was his concept, his view, of the power of the presidency?” In addition, there are other recurring questions concerning the Buchanan presidency such as “Why did Buchanan assemble such a weak cabinet?”; “What were his real views of the institution of slavery?”; “And how could he have believed that the Supreme Court through the Dred Scott decision would provide a definitive settlement to the slavery issue?” Carrafiello, \\"Diplomatic Failure: James Buchanan’S Inaugural Address.\\" (2010) p. 146.

He had been Vice President of the United States for only days when he succeeded to the presidency. The 17th United States president, Johnson was a member of the Democratic Party before the Civil War and had been Lincoln's 1864 running mate on the National Union ticket, which was supported by Republicans and War Democrats. Johnson took office as the Civil War came to a close, and his presidency was dominated by the aftermath of the war. As president, Johnson attempted to build his own party of Southerners and conservative Northerners, but he was unable to unite his supporters into a new party. Republican Ulysses S. Grant succeeded Johnson as president. Johnson, who was himself from Tennessee, favored quick restoration of the seceded states to the Union. He implemented his own form of Presidential Reconstruction – a series of proclamations directing the seceded states to hold conventions and elections to re-form their civil governments. His plans did not give protection to the former slaves, and he came into conflict with the Republican-dominated Congress. When Southern states returned many of their old leaders passed Black Codes to deprive the freedmen of many civil liberties, congressional Republicans refused to seat legislators from those states and established military districts across the South. Johnson vetoed their bills, and congressional Republicans overrode him, setting a pattern for the remainder of his presidency. Frustrated by Johnson's actions, Congress proposed the Fourteenth Amendment to the states, and the amendment was ratified in 1868. As the conflict between the branches of government grew, Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act, restricting Johnson's ability to fire Cabinet officials. When he persisted in trying to dismiss Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, he was impeached by the House of Representatives, making him the first U.S. president to be impeached. Johnson narrowly avoided conviction in the Senate and removal from office, but he exercised little power in his last year in office. In foreign policy, Johnson presided over the purchase of Alaska, and his presidency saw the end of the French intervention in Mexico. Having broken with Republicans, and failing to establish his own party under the National Union banner, Johnson sought the 1868 Democratic presidential nomination, but it went to Horatio Seymour instead. Seymour's defeat by Grant in the 1868 presidential election left Northern Republicans firmly in control of Reconstruction. Though he was held in high esteem by the Dunning School of historians, more recent historians rank Johnson among the worst American presidents for his frequent clashes with Congress, strong opposition to federally guaranteed rights for African Americans, and general ineffectiveness as president. Accession Contemporary woodcut of Johnson being sworn in by Chief Justice Chase as Cabinet members look on, April 15, 1865 President Abraham Lincoln had won the 1860 presidential election as a member of the Republican Party, but, in hopes of winning the support of War Democrats, he ran under the banner of the National Union Party in the 1864 presidential election. At the party's convention in Baltimore in June, Lincoln was easily nominated, but the party dropped Vice President Hannibal Hamlin from the ticket in favor of Andrew Johnson, a War Democrat who served as the military governor of Tennessee. After the National Union ticket won the 1864 presidential election, Johnson was sworn in as vice president on March 4, 1865. On April 14, 1865, in the closing days of the Civil War, President Lincoln was shot and mortally wounded by John Wilkes Booth, a Confederate sympathizer. The shooting of the president was part of a conspiracy to assassinate Lincoln, Vice President Andrew Johnson, and Secretary of State William Seward on the same night. Seward barely survived his wounds, while Johnson escaped attack as his would-be assassin, George Atzerodt, got drunk instead of killing the vice president. Leonard J. Farwell, a fellow boarder at the Kirkwood House, awoke Johnson with news of Lincoln's shooting at Ford's Theatre. Johnson rushed to the president's deathbed, where he remained a short time, on his return promising, \\"They shall suffer for this. They shall suffer for this.\\" Lincoln died at 7:22 am the next morning; Johnson's swearing in occurred between 10 and 11 am with Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase presiding in the presence of most of the Cabinet. Johnson's demeanor was described by the newspapers as \\"solemn and dignified\\". Johnson presided over Lincoln's funeral ceremonies in Washington, before his predecessor's body was sent home to Springfield, Illinois, for burial. At the suggestion of Attorney General James Speed, Johnson allowed a military commission to try the surviving alleged perpetrators of Lincoln's assassination. A six-week trial culminated in death sentences for four of the defendants, along with lesser sentences for the others. The events of the assassination resulted in speculation, then and subsequently, concerning Johnson and what the conspirators might have intended for him. In the vain hope of having his life spared after his capture, Atzerodt spoke much about the conspiracy, but did not say anything to indicate that the plotted assassination of Johnson was merely a ruse. Conspiracy theorists point to the fact that on the day of the assassination, Booth came to the Kirkwood House and left one of his cards. This object was received by Johnson's private secretary, William A. Browning, with an inscription, \\"Are you at home? Don't wish to disturb you. J. Wilkes Booth.\\" Partisan affiliation Johnson took office at a time of shifting partisan alignments. Former Whigs and former Democrats contended for influence within the Republican Party, while the remaining Northern Democrats looked to redefine their party in the wake of the Civil War. Johnson's accession left a Southern former Democrat in the president's office at the end of a civil war that had as its immediate impetus the election of Abraham Lincoln, a Northern Republican, to the presidency in 1860. Johnson had served as a Democrat in various offices prior to the Civil War, and he became one of the most prominent Southern Unionists after the start of the war. During the 1864 presidential election, the Republican ticket campaigned as the National Union ticket, and the National Union convention chose Johnson as the party's vice presidential nominee in large part because of Johnson's status as a prominent Southern War Democrat. Though he never declared himself to be a Republican, when Johnson took office, he had widespread approval within the Republican Party. Johnson's Reconstruction policy quickly alienated many in the Republican Party, while Johnson's patronage decisions and alliance with Seward alienated many Democrats. Instead of allying with either of the established parties, Johnson sought to create a new party consisting of the conservative elements of both parties. In August 1866, Johnson held a convention of his supporters in Philadelphia. The convention endorsed Johnson's program, but Johnson was unable to establish a durable coalition. Towards the end of his term, Johnson pursued the 1868 Democratic nomination, but his alliance with Lincoln and his patronage decisions had made him many enemies in that party. Administration On taking office, Johnson promised to continue the policies of his predecessor, and he initially kept Lincoln's cabinet in place. Secretary of State William Seward became one of the most influential members of Johnson's Cabinet, and Johnson allowed Seward to pursue an expansionary foreign policy. Early in his presidency, Johnson trusted Secretary of War Edwin Stanton to carry out his Reconstruction policies, and he also had a favorable opinion of Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles and Secretary of the Treasury Hugh McCullough. He had less esteem for Postmaster General William Dennison Jr., Attorney General James Speed, and Secretary of the Interior James Harlan. Harlan, Dennison, and Speed resigned in June 1866 after Johnson had broken with congressional Republicans. Speed's replacement, Henry Stanbery, emerged as one of the most prominent members of Johnson's cabinet before resigning to defend Johnson during his impeachment trial. Johnson suspended Stanton after disagreements related to Reconstruction and replaced him with General of the Army Ulysses S. Grant on an interim basis. After clashing with Grant, Johnson offered the position of Secretary of War to General William T. Sherman, who declined, and to Lorenzo Thomas, who accepted. Thomas never took office; Johnson appointed John Schofield as Secretary of War as a compromise with moderate Republicans. Judicial appointments Johnson appointed nine Article III federal judges during his presidency, all to United States district courts; he did not successfully appoint a justice to serve on the Supreme Court. In April 1866, he nominated Henry Stanbery to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left by the death of Associate Justice John Catron, but Congress eliminated the seat by passing the Judicial Circuits Act of 1866. To ensure that Johnson did not get to make any appointments, the act also provided that the Court would shrink by one justice when one next departed from office. Johnson did appoint his Greeneville crony, Samuel Milligan, to the United States Court of Claims, where he served from 1868 until his death in 1874. End of the Civil War and abolition of slavery Johnson took office after Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomatox Court House, but Confederate armies remained in the field. On April 21, 1865, Johnson, with the unanimous backing of his cabinet, ordered General Ulysses S. Grant to overturn an armistice concluded between Union General William T. Sherman and Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston. The armistice had included political conditions such as the recognition of existing Confederate state governments. On May 2, Johnson issued a proclamation offering $100,000 for the capture of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who many thought had been involved in the assassination of Lincoln. Davis was captured on May 10. In late May, the final Confederate force in the field surrendered, and Johnson presided over a triumphant military parade in Washington, D.C. alongside the cabinet and the nation's top generals. After less than two months in office, Johnson had cultivated the reputation of someone who would be tough on the defeated Confederacy, and his esteem among congressional Republicans remained high. In the final days of Lincoln's presidency, Congress had approved what would become the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery and involuntary servitude nationwide. The amendment was ratified by the requisite number of states (then 27) in December 1865, becoming the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Though Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation had freed many slaves in the former Confederacy, the Thirteenth Amendment permanently abolished slavery nationwide and freed slaves in border states like Kentucky. Reconstruction With the end of the Civil War, Johnson faced the question of what to do with the states that had formed the Confederacy. President Lincoln had authorized loyalist governments in Virginia, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Tennessee as the Union came to control large parts of those states and advocated a ten percent plan that would allow elections after ten percent of the voters in any state took an oath of future loyalty to the Union. Many in Congress considered this too lenient. The Wade–Davis Bill, requiring a majority of voters to take the loyalty oath, had passed both houses of Congress in 1864, but Lincoln had pocket vetoed it. At the time of Johnson's accession, Congress consisted of three factions. The Radical Republicans sought voting and other civil rights for African Americans. They believed that the freedmen could be induced to vote Republican in gratitude for emancipation, and that black votes could keep the Republicans in power. Radical Republicans were defined by their views on Reconstruction, the protection of minority rights, and the necessity of a stronger postwar role for the federal government; they did not hold unified views on economic matters. The Moderate Republicans were not as enthusiastic about the idea of African-American suffrage as their Radical colleagues, either because of their own local political concerns, or because they believed that the freedman would be likely to cast his vote badly. Nonetheless, they were committed to ensuring that African-Americans were granted more than \\"nominal freedom,\\" and they opposed restoring Confederate officials to power. The third faction in Congress, Northern Democrats, favored the unconditional restoration of the Southern states and opposed African-American suffrage. Presidential Reconstruction Johnson was initially left to devise a Reconstruction policy without legislative intervention, as Congress was not due to meet again until December 1865. Johnson believed that the Southern states had never truly left the Union. With the rebellion defeated, he thought that the South should re- take their place as equal partners under the United States Constitution. Despite the pleas of African-Americans and many congressional Republicans, Johnson viewed suffrage as a state issue, and was uninterested in using federal power to impose sweeping changes on the defeated South. Johnson instead sought to help working class whites overcome the elite planter class, with African Americans still relegated to the lowest rung of Southern society. Johnson decided to organize state governments throughout the South, acting quickly to reconstitute governments in states that had, until recently, been in rebellion. In May 1865, he removed Nathaniel P. Banks from command in Louisiana after Banks protested the appointment of former Confederate officials by Governor James Madison Wells. That same month, Johnson recognized Francis Harrison Pierpont's government in Virginia, and appointed William Woods Holden as Governor of North Carolina. Johnson subsequently appointed governors to lead the other former Confederate states. He chose those governors without regard to their previous political affiliation or ideology, instead focusing upon their loyalty to the Union during the Civil War. Johnson did not impose many conditions on his governors, asking only that they seek the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment and the repudiation of secession ordinances and the Confederate debt. Alabama Governor Lewis E. Parsons, a Johnson appointee, declared that \\"every political right which the state possessed under the federal Constitution is hers today, with the single exception relating to slavery.\\" The Southern governors called state conventions that in turn organized new governments and called new elections, from which former secessionists emerged triumphant. The new governments passed strict Black Codes that constituted a virtual re-establishment of slavery. Johnson refused to interfere, as he firmly believed that such matters were state, rather than federal, issues. Johnson frequently acted to undermine the Freedmen's Bureau, an agency that had been established by Congress in March 1865. Together with the U.S. Army, the Freedmen's Bureau acted as a relief agency and police force in the South, providing aid to both whites and blacks. In September 1865, Johnson overturned a Freedmen's Bureau order that had granted abandoned land to freedmen who had begun cultivating it; Johnson instead ordered such property returned to its pre-war owners. Johnson also purged Freedmen's Bureau officers whom Southern whites had accused of favoring blacks. Johnson was less active in curbing the army's authority than that of the Freedmen's Bureau, but the army nonetheless saw its influence decline as soldiers were demobilized following the end of the war. In addition to quickly restoring state governments and interfering with the work of the Freedmen's Bureau, Johnson also sought to restore the property and civil rights of white Southerners. On May 29, 1865, Johnson offered amnesty to most former Confederates. The order did not include high military and civil officers of the Confederacy, war criminals, and those with taxable property greater than $20,000. In late 1865 and early 1866, on the advice of the Southern governors that he had appointed, Johnson pardoned much of the elite planter class. Subsequently, the planter elite largely re-took power in the South, contrary to Johnson's earlier plans for Reconstruction. Foner notes that the motivation for Johnson's decision to re-empower to the Southern prewar elite, despite his earlier support for the punishment of rebel leaders, \\"has always been something of a mystery.\\" Foner speculates that Johnson believed that an alliance with the planters would ensure ongoing white domination of the South and boost his 1868 re-election bid. Johnson's 1865 program of presidential reconstruction extinguished any hope of enforcing black suffrage in the aftermath of the Civil War, as re-empowered Southern whites were no longer willing to accept sweeping changes to the pre-war status quo. Return of Congress Though not all Republicans favored black suffrage, the passage of the Black Codes and the restoration to power of former Confederate leaders elicited widespread outrage in the party. On its return in December 1865, Congress refused to seat the Southern Congressmen who had been elected by the governments established under Johnson. It also established the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, led by Moderate Republican Senator William P. Fessenden, to investigate conditions in the South. Despite these moves, most members of Congress were reluctant to directly confront the president, and initially only sought to fine-tune Johnson's policies towards the South. According to Trefousse, \\"If there was a time when Johnson could have come to an agreement with the moderates of the Republican Party, it was the period following the return of Congress\\". Thomas Nast cartoon of Johnson disposing of the Freedmen's Bureau as African Americans go flying Illinois Senator Lyman Trumbull, leader of the Moderate Republicans and Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, was anxious to reach an understanding with the president. He ushered through Congress a bill extending the Freedmen's Bureau beyond its scheduled abolition in 1867, as well as a civil rights bill. The civil rights bill granted birthright citizenship to all individuals born in the United States, with the exception of Native Americans, and declared that no state could violate the fundamental rights of U.S. citizens. Trumbull met several times with Johnson and became convinced that the president would sign the measures. To the delight of white Southerners and the puzzled anger of Republican legislators, Johnson vetoed the Freedman's Bureau bill on February 18, 1866. By late January 1866, Johnson had become convinced that winning a showdown with the Radical Republicans was necessary to his political plans – both for the success of Reconstruction and for re-election in 1868. In his veto message, he argued that the Freedman's Bureau was an unconstitutional and unwise exercise of federal power, and added that Congress should not consider major legislation while the eleven former Confederate states were not represented in Congress. Johnson considered himself vindicated when a move to override his veto failed in the Senate the following day. Johnson believed that the Radicals would now be isolated and defeated, and that the Moderate Republicans would form behind him; he did not understand that Moderates too wanted to see African Americans treated fairly. On February 22, 1866, Washington's Birthday, Johnson gave an impromptu speech to supporters who had marched to the White House and called for an address in honor of George Washington. In his hour-long speech, he instead referred to himself over 200 times. More damagingly, he also spoke of \\"men ... still opposed to the Union\\" to whom he could not extend the hand of friendship he gave to the South. When called upon by the crowd to say who they were, Johnson named Pennsylvania Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner, and abolitionist Wendell Phillips, and accused them of plotting his assassination. Republicans viewed the address as a declaration of war, while one Democratic ally estimated Johnson's speech cost Democratic Party 200,000 votes in the 1866 congressional midterm elections. Break with the Republicans Even after the veto of the Freedman's Bureau bill, Moderate Republicans were hopeful that Johnson would sign the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which had passed Congress with nearly unanimous support from Republicans. Though most of Johnson's cabinet urged him to sign the Civil Rights Act, the president vetoed it, marking a permanent break with the moderate faction of the Republican Party. In his veto message, Johnson argued that the bill discriminated against whites and a dangerous expansion of federal power. Within three weeks, Congress had overridden his veto, the first time that had been done on a major bill in American history. According to Stewart, the veto was \\"for many his defining blunder, setting a tone of perpetual confrontation with Congress that prevailed for the rest of his presidency\\". Congress also passed the Freedmen's Bureau Act a second time, and again the president vetoed it; this time, the veto was overridden. Congressional Republicans were angered by Johnson's obstruction of Congress's Reconstruction program, which eventually led to his impeachment. The battle over Reconstruction encouraged both radical and moderate Republicans to seek Constitutional guarantees for black rights, rather than relying on temporary political majorities. Congress had already begun to consider amendments to address the issue of black suffrage and congressional apportionment in light of the abolition of slavery. In late April, the Joint Committee on Reconstruction proposed an amendment that addressed most of the major issues facing Congress. The first section of the proposed amendment enshrined the principle of birthright citizenship in the constitution, and required states to observe the principles of due process and equal protection of the law. Other sections temporarily disenfranchised former Confederate officials, prohibited the payment of Confederate debts, and provided for the reduction congressional representation in proportion to the number of male voters denied suffrage. Johnson was strongly opposed to this proposed Fourteenth Amendment, which he saw as a repudiation of his administration's actions, and he used his influence to oppose the measure. Despite unanimous opposition from congressional Democrats, the amendment passed both houses of Congress in June 1866 and was formally proposed to the states for ratification. While Johnson clashed with Congress over Reconstruction, ex-Confederates and other Southerners used increasingly violent methods to oppose federal authority and re-establish their own dominance. Through a mix of legal and extra-legal means, many African- Americans were forced into a coercive labor system that left most blacks without true economic freedom. Concerns about cost and a large standing army led Congress to authorize a 54,000-man peacetime army, which was three times the size of the 1860 force but dramatically smaller than the 1865 force. Overstretched army forces kept order in towns and cities, but were forced to withdraw from most rural areas. Even in cities, mobs attacked African- Americans, \\"carpetbaggers\\" (Northerners who moved to the South during Reconstruction), and federal forces in upheavals such as the Memphis riots and the New Orleans riot. These riots shocked many in the North and discredited Johnson's Reconstruction policies, resulting in increased support for a continued federal presence in the South. 1866 mid-term elections Facing opposition in Congress, Johnson sought to boost his supporters in the November 1866 congressional elections. In August 1866, Johnson held the National Union Convention, using the label that the Republican ticket had campaigned on during the 1864 presidential election. Johnson hoped to unite his conservative supporters into a new party, but the convention ended only with a pledge by attendees to support Johnson and his policies in the 1866 campaign. Republican supporters like Seward and Thurlow Weed, and Democratic supporters like Samuel L. M. Barlow, were unwilling to fully break with their party. Following the convention, Johnson campaigned vigorously, undertaking a public speaking tour known as the \\"Swing Around the Circle\\". The trip, including speeches in Chicago, St. Louis, Indianapolis and Columbus, proved politically disastrous, as the president made controversial comparisons between himself and Christ and engaged in arguments with hecklers. These exchanges were attacked as beneath the dignity of the presidency. The Republicans won major gains in Congress and made plans to control Reconstruction. Johnson blamed the Democrats for giving only lukewarm support to the National Union movement. Radical Reconstruction =First Reconstruction Act= thumbright300pxMap of the five military districts established by the First Reconstruction Act Reconvening in December 1866, an energized Congress began passing legislation, often over a presidential veto. In February 1867, Congress admitted Nebraska to the Union over a veto. As a result, the Republican majority in the Senate grew by two, and the Fourteenth Amendment gained one ratification vote. Another bill passed over Johnson's veto granted voting rights to African Americans in the District of Columbia. Johnson also vetoed legislation admitting Colorado Territory to the Union, but Congress failed to override it, as enough senators agreed that a district with a population of only 30,000 was not yet worthy of statehood. Meanwhile, state legislatures in every former Confederate state—with the exception of Tennessee—refused to ratify the Fourteenth Amendment. This refusal prompted Congressman Thaddeus Stevens to introduce legislation to dissolve the Southern state governments and reconstitute them into five military districts, under martial law. State governments would be reformed after holding constitutional conventions. African Americans could vote for or become delegates to these conventions, while former Confederates could not. During the legislative process, Congress added to the bill a provision requiring that restoration to the Union would follow the state's ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. Johnson and the Southerners attempted a compromise, whereby the South would agree to a modified version of the amendment that did not include the disqualification of former Confederates and that limited black suffrage. The Republicans insisted on the full language of the amendment, and the deal fell through. Johnson vetoed the resulting First Reconstruction Act on March 2, 1867, but Congress overrode his veto on the same day. The First Reconstruction Act served as the legislative centerpiece of Radical Reconstruction, as Congress fully seized leadership of Reconstruction from Johnson. Though Johnson retained the power to command and undermine the army and the Freedmen's Bureau, the First Reconstruction Act asserted Congress's ability to protect the rights of African Americans and prevent ex-Confederates from re-establishing political dominance. Following the passage of the act, African-Americans began to participate in elections en masse for the first time; the share of black adult males registered to vote rose from 0.5% in December 1866 to 80.5% in December 1867, with all of that increase occurring in former Confederate states. As the Democratic Party was dominated by whites hostile to black voting rights, African Americans overwhelmingly chose to join the Republican Party. Aside from protecting African-American voting rights and disqualifying ex- Confederates from voting, the First Reconstruction Act also required the appointment of commanders for five districts that covered all of the former Confederate state other than Tennessee, which had been re-admitted in 1866. In consultation with General Grant, Johnson appointed Generals John Schofield, Daniel Sickles, John Pope, Edward Ord, and Philip Sheridan to command the five districts. =Later Reconstruction Acts= To ensure that Johnson would not have a free hand over Reconstruction, as he had had in 1865, the 39th United States Congress passed a law that called the 40th Congress into session in March 1867 rather than its December 1867, when it would usually have convened. One of the first actions taken by the 40th Congress was to pass the Second Reconstruction Act, doing so over Johnson's veto. The act provided for the registration of only those voters that could show their loyalty to the Union, as well as the calling of state conventions to create new governments. Johnson's Attorney General, Henry Stanbery, asserted that the governments established by Johnson, rather than the military governments established by Congress, reigned supreme in the South. Disturbed by Johnson's defiance, Congress reconvened in July to pass the Third Reconstruction Act over Johnson's veto. The act established the supremacy of the military governments in the South, and gave the military the power to remove state officials from office. After Secretary of War Edwin Stanton opposed Johnson's decision to veto the Third Reconstruction Act, Johnson decided to remove Stanton, setting the stage for a battle that would consume much of the second half of his presidency. Throughout 1867, Southern politics polarized along partisan lines. Most Southern whites favored the Democratic Party, while the Republican Party in the South consisted of African-Americans, carpetbaggers, and \\"scalawags\\", Southern whites who had largely opposed secession and now aligned with the Republicans. By early 1868, every former Confederate state but Texas had convened a constitutional convention and produced a new state constitution. As the conventions had been dominated by Republicans, the new state constitutions mandated suffrage for men (except leading ex-Confederates) without regard to race or property. Under the Reconstruction Acts, the new constitutions required ratification by a majority of registered voters to take effect. Southern Democrats boycotted the ratification votes, and groups such as the Ku Klux Klan engaged in terrorist campaigns to suppress voter turnout. In February 1868, Congress passed the Fourth Reconstruction over Johnson's veto. The act allowed for the ratification of new state constitutions with the approval of a majority of those voting, rather than a majority of those registered to vote. Impeachment \\"The Situation\\", a Harper's Weekly editorial cartoon shows Secretary of War Stanton aiming a cannon labeled \\"Congress\\" to defeat Johnson. The rammer is \\"Tenure of Office Bill\\" and cannonballs on the floor are \\"Justice\\". Removal of Stanton On March 2, 1867, in response to the president's statements indicating that he planned to fire Cabinet secretaries who did not agree with him, Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act. The act required Senate approval for the firing of Cabinet members during the tenure of the president who appointed them. The Tenure of Office Act was immediately controversial; some senators doubted that it was constitutional and questioned whether the act's terms applied to Johnson, whose key Cabinet officers were Lincoln holdovers. The validity of the Tenure of Office Act would be tested by Johnson's clash with Secretary of War Stanton. Johnson both admired, and was exasperated by Secretary of War Stanton, who, in combination with General Grant, worked to undermine the president's Southern policy from within his own administration. Johnson considered firing Stanton, but respected him for his wartime service as secretary. Stanton, for his part, feared allowing Johnson to appoint his successor and refused to resign, despite his public disagreements with his president. In mid-1867, Johnson and Stanton battled over the question of whether the military officers placed in command of the South could override the civil authorities. The president had Attorney General Stanbery issue an opinion backing his position that they could not. On August 5, after Stanton refused to endorse Johnson's position, the president demanded Stanton's resignation. The secretary refused to quit at a time when Congress was out of session. Johnson then suspended him pending the next meeting of Congress, as permitted under the Tenure of Office Act. Grant agreed to serve as temporary replacement while continuing to lead the army. Although Republicans expressed anger with his actions, the 1867 elections generally went Democratic. No seats in Congress were directly elected in the polling, but the Democrats took control of the Ohio General Assembly, allowing them to defeat for re-election one of Johnson's strongest opponents, Senator Benjamin Wade. Voters in Ohio, Connecticut, and Minnesota turned down propositions to grant African Americans the vote. The adverse results momentarily put a stop to Republican calls to impeach Johnson, who was elated by the election results. Nevertheless, once Congress met in November, the Judiciary Committee reversed itself and passed a resolution of impeachment against Johnson. After much debate about whether anything the president had done was a high crime or misdemeanor, the standard for impeachment under the Constitution, the resolution was defeated in the House of Representatives. Johnson notified Congress of Stanton's suspension and Grant's interim appointment. In January 1868, the Senate disapproved of his action, and reinstated Stanton, contending the president had violated the Tenure of Office Act. Over Johnson's objection, Grant stepped down as Secretary of War, causing a complete break between the two. Johnson then dismissed Stanton and nominated Lorenzo Thomas as Stanton's replacement. Stanton still refused to leave his office, and on February 24, 1868, the House impeached the president for intentionally violating the Tenure of Office Act, by a vote of 128 to 47. The House subsequently adopted eleven articles of impeachment, for the most part alleging that he had violated the Tenure of Office Act, and had questioned the legitimacy of Congress. Johnson thus became the first U.S. president to be impeached by Congress. Theodore R. Davis' illustration of Johnson's impeachment trial in the United States Senate, published in Harper's Weekly Impeachment trial On March 5, 1868, the impeachment trial began in the Senate. Congressmen George S. Boutwell, Benjamin Butler, and Thaddeus Stevens acted as managers for the House, or prosecutors, while William M. Evarts, Benjamin R. Curtis and former Attorney General Stanbery were Johnson's counsel. Chief Justice Chase served as presiding judge. The defense relied on the provision of the Tenure of Office Act that made it applicable only to appointees of the current administration. Since Lincoln had appointed Stanton, the defense maintained Johnson had not violated the act; they also argued that the president had the right to test the constitutionality of an act of Congress. Johnson's counsel insisted that he make no appearance at the trial, nor publicly comment about the proceedings, and except for a pair of interviews in April, he complied. Behind the scenes, Johnson maneuvered to gain an acquittal; for example, he pledged to Iowa Senator James W. Grimes that he would not interfere with Congress's Reconstruction efforts. Grimes reported to a group of Moderates that he believed the president would keep his word. Johnson also promised to install the respected John Schofield as War Secretary. Kansas Senator Edmund G. Ross received assurances that the new, Radical-influenced constitutions ratified in South Carolina and Arkansas would be transmitted to the Congress without delay, an action which would give him and other senators political cover to vote for acquittal. Other factors also favored a Johnson acquittal. If he was removed from office, Johnson's successor would have been Ohio Senator Wade, the president pro tempore of the Senate. Wade, a lame duck whose term would end in early 1869, was a Radical who supported such measures as women's suffrage, placing him beyond the pale politically in much of the nation. Additionally, many Republicans saw a President Wade as a potential obstacle to a Grant victory in the 1868 presidential election. With the dealmaking, Johnson was confident of the result in advance of the verdict, and in the days leading up to the ballot, newspapers reported that Stevens and his Radicals had given up. On May 16, the Senate voted on the 11th article of impeachment, accusing Johnson of firing Stanton in violation of the Tenure of Office of Act once the Senate had overturned his suspension. 35 senators voted \\"guilty\\" and 19 \\"not guilty\\", and thus the Senate fell short by a single vote of the two- thirds majority required for conviction under the Constitution. Seven Republicans—Senators Grimes, Ross, Trumbull, William Pitt Fessenden, Joseph S. Fowler, John B. Henderson, and Peter G. Van Winkle—joined their Democratic colleagues in voting to acquit the president. After the vote, the Senate adjourned for the Republican National Convention, which nominated Grant for president. The Senate returned on May 26 and voted on the second and third articles, with identical 35–19 results. Faced with those results, Johnson's opponents gave up and dismissed proceedings. Stanton \\"relinquished\\" his office on May 26, and the Senate subsequently confirmed Schofield as Secretary of War When Johnson renominated Stanbery to return to his position as Attorney General after his service as a defense manager, the Senate refused to confirm him. Allegations were made at the time and again later that bribery dictated the outcome of the trial. Even when it was in progress, Representative Butler began an investigation, held hearings, and issued a report, which was not endorsed by any other congressman. Butler focused on a New York–based \\"Astor House Group\\", supposedly led by political boss and editor Thurlow Weed. This organization was said to have raised large sums of money from whiskey interests through Cincinnati lawyer Charles Woolley to bribe senators to acquit Johnson. Butler went so far as to imprison Woolley in the Capitol building when he refused to answer questions, but failed to prove bribery. Aftermath thumb400pxrightState ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment: The final impeachment vote maintained the principle that Congress should not remove the president from office simply because its members disagreed with him over policy, style, and administration of office. But it did not mean that the president retained effective governing power. For the remaining months of his term, Johnson was a nonentity with little influence on public policy. In the months after the impeachment vote, Congress re-admitted the seven Southern states that had written new constitutions and ratified the Fourteenth Amendment. As Radical Republicans feared that these Southern states would deny African-Americans the right to vote in 1868 or future elections, they also drafted what would become the Fifteenth Amendment, which prohibited the restriction of suffrage on the basis of \\"race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\\" Congress overrode Johnson's veto of the re-admission of the Southern states, as well as Johnson's veto of a bill denying electoral votes to the states that had not yet been reorganized. Shortly before it adjourned in July 1868, Congress adopted a concurrent resolution declaring the Fourteenth Amendment to be a part of the Constitution, as the requisite number of states had ratified the amendment. Though it made provisions for a reconvening in September should Johnson defy its policies, Congress did not reconvene until after the 1868 election. Other domestic policies Treasury policies The Civil War had been financed primarily by issuing short-term and long-term bonds and loans, plus inflation caused by printing paper money, plus new taxes. Wholesale prices had more than doubled, and reduction of inflation was a priority for Secretary of the Treasury Hugh McCulloch.Herbert S. Schell, \\"Hugh McCulloch and the Treasury Department, 1865-1869.\\" Mississippi Valley Historical Review 17.3 (1930): 404-421. online A high priority, and by far the most controversial, was the currency question. The old paper currency issued by state banks had been withdrawn, and Confederate currency was worthless. The national banks had issued $207 million in currency, which was backed by gold and silver. The federal treasury had issued $428 million in greenbacks, which was legal tender but not backed by gold or silver. In addition about $275 million of coin was in circulation. The new administration policy announced in October would be to make all the paper convertible into specie, if Congress so voted. The House of Representatives passed the Alley Resolution on December 18, 1865 by vote of 144 to 6. In the Senate it was a different matter, for the key player was Senator John Sherman, who said that inflation contraction was not nearly as important as refunding the short-term and long-term national debt. The war had been largely financed by national debt, in addition to taxation and inflation. The national debt stood at $2.8 billion. By October 1865, most of it in short term and temporary loans.For an econometric approach see Lee E. Ohanian, The Macroeconomic Effects of War Finance in the United States: Taxes, Inflation, and Deficit Finance (Routledge, 2018). Wall Street bankers typified by Jay Cooke believed that the economy was about to grow rapidly, thanks to the development of agriculture through the Homestead Act, the expansion of railroads, especially rebuilding the devastated Southern railroads and in opening the transcontinental line to the West Coast, and especially the flourishing of manufacturing during the war. The goal premium over greenbacks was hundred and $145 in greenbacks to $100 in gold, and the optimists thought that the heavy demand for currency in an era of prosperity would return the ratio to 100.Schell, 1930. A compromise was reached in April 1866, that limited the treasury to a currency contraction of only $10 million over six months. Meanwhile the Senate refunded the entire national debt, but the House failed to act. By early 1867, postwar prosperity was a reality, and the optimists wanted an end to contraction, which Congress ordered in January 1868. Meanwhile, the Treasury issued new bonds at a lower interest rate to refinance the redemption of short-term debt. while the old state bank notes were disappearing from circulation, new national bank notes, backed by species, were expanding. By 1868 inflation was minimal.Margaret G. Myers, A financial history of the United States (Columbia UP, 1970), pp 174-96.Paul Studenski, and Herman E. Kroos, Financial History of the United States (2nd ed. 1963).Irwin Unger, The Greenback Era: A Social and Political History of American Finance 1865-1879 (Princeton UP, 1964).Robert P. Sharkey, Money, Class, and Party: An Economic Study of Civil War and Reconstruction (Johns Hopkins Press, 1967). Land and labor policies In June 1866, Johnson signed the Southern Homestead Act into law, in hopes that legislation would assist poor whites. Around 28,000 land claims were successfully patented, although few former slaves benefited from the law, fraud was rampant, and much of the best land was reserved for railroads. In June 1868, Johnson signed a law passed by Congress that established an eight-hour workday for laborers and mechanics employed by the federal government. Although Johnson told members of a Workingmen's party delegation in Baltimore that he could not directly commit himself to an eight-hour day, he nevertheless told the same delegation that he greatly favored the \\"shortest number of hours consistent with the interests of all.\\" According to Richard F. Selcer, however, the good intentions behind the law were \\"immediately frustrated,\\" as wages were cut by 20%. Nebraska statehood In June 1866, Nebraska Territory voters narrowly approved a draft constitution; one of its provisions limited voting rights to white males. A bill to admit Nebraska to the union was then introduced in Congress, where it was adopted just before the session ended in late July, notwithstanding some resistance from Republicans who opposed the \\"white suffrage\\" clause in the new constitution, as well as Democrats who were leery of granting statehood to another Republican stronghold. President Johnson pocket vetoed the bill after Congress adjourned. The issue was renewed shortly after Congress reconvened in December 1866. This time, however, an amendment sponsored by Senator George F. Edmunds effectively conditioned statehood on the acceptance by the territory of a prohibition against voting restrictions based on race or color. The amendment won the support of radical Republicans and others hoping to impose similar conditions on the former Confederate states. But it drew fire from Democrats and Johnson, who opposed the condition on constitutional grounds. They argued that the federal government could not infringe on the power of states to establish their own qualifications for suffrage. The issue of statehood had become a question of federalism, as well as a tug of war between the president and Congress. Despite Johnson's objections, Congress passed admission legislation for Nebraska in January 1867. Johnson vetoed the measure that same month. Less than two weeks after Johnson vetoed the Nebraska statehood bill, both houses of Congress voted overwhelmingly to override it. The territorial legislature quickly accepted the condition imposed by the Edmunds Amendment, thus eliminating racial restrictions on voting. On March 1, 1867, Nebraska became the first–and to this day the only–state to be admitted to the Union by means of a veto override. Foreign policy Mexico France had established the Second Mexican Empire in 1863, despite American warnings that this was an unacceptable violation of the Monroe Doctrine. The French army propped up Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico and defeated local political opposition led by Benito Juárez. Once the Confederacy was defeated, Johnson and Grant sent General Phil Sheridan with 50,000 combat veterans to the Texas-Mexico border to emphasize the demand that France withdraw. Johnson provided arms to Juarez, and imposed a naval blockade. In response, Napoleon III informed the Johnson administration that all his troops would be brought home by November 1867. Maximilian was eventually captured and executed in June 1867.Michele Cunningham, Mexico and the foreign policy of Napoleon III. (2001); see PhD version of the book online. Expansionism and Alaska Purchase Seward was an expansionist, and sought opportunities to gain territory for the United States. In 1867, he negotiated a treaty with Denmark to purchase the Danish West Indies for $7.5 million, but the Senate refused to ratify it.Halvdan Koht, \\"The Origin of Seward's Plan to Purchase the Danish West Indies.\\" American Historical Review 50.4 (1945): 762-767. Online Seward also proposed to acquire British Columbia as a trade-off against the Alabama Claims, but the British were uninterested in this proposal.David E. Shi, \\"Seward's Attempt to Annex British Columbia, 1865-1869.\\" Pacific Historical Review 47.2 (1978): 217-238. online Seward was successful in staking an American claim to uninhabited Wake Island in the Pacific, which would be officially claimed by the U.S. in 1898. By 1867, the Russian government saw its North American colony (today Alaska) as a financial liability, and feared eventually losing it if a war broke out with Britain. Russian minister Eduard de Stoeckl was instructed to sell Alaska to the United States, and did so deftly, convincing Seward to raise his initial offer from $5 million to $7.2 million. This sum is the inflation-adjusted equivalent to $ in present-day terms. On March 30, 1867, de Stoeckl and Seward signed the treaty, and President Johnson summoned the Senate into session and it approved the Alaska Purchase in 37–2 vote. Although ridiculed in some quarters as \\"Seward's Folly,\\" American public opinion was generally quite favorable in terms of the potential for economic benefits at a bargain price, maintaining the friendship of Russia. and blocking British expansion.Richard E. Welch, \\"American public opinion and the purchase of Russian America.\\" American Slavic and East European Review 17#4 (1958): 481-494 online Another treaty that failed was the Johnson-Clarendon convention, negotiated in settlement of the Alabama Claims, for damages to American shipping from British-built Confederate raiders. Negotiated by the United States Minister to Britain, former Maryland senator Reverdy Johnson, in late 1868, it was ignored by the Senate during the remainder of Johnson's term. The treaty was rejected after he left office, and the Grant administration later negotiated a treaty with considerably better terms for the United States. Fenian raids The Fenians, a secret Irish Catholic militant organization, recruited heavily among Civil War veterans in preparation to invade Canada. The group's goal was to force Britain to grant Ireland its independence. The Fenians counted thousands of members, but they had a confused command structure, competing factions, unfamiliar new weapons, and British agents in their ranks who alerted the Canadians. Their invasion forces were too small and had poor leadership. Several attempts were organized, but they were either canceled the last at the last minute or failed in a matter of hours. The largest raid took place on On May 31-June 2, 1866, when about 1000 Fenians crossed the Niagara River. The Canadians were forewarned, and over 20,000 Canadian militia and British regulars turned out. A few men on each side were killed and the Fenians soon retreated home. The Johnson administration at first quietly tolerated this violation of American neutrality, but, by 1867, dispatched the U.S. Army to prevent further Fenian raids. A second attack in 1870 was broken up by the United States Marshal for Vermont.Charles Perry Stacey, \\"Fenianism and the Rise of National Feeling in Canada at the Time of Confederation.\\" Canadian Historical Review 12.3 (1931): 238-261. 1868 election and transition \\"Farewell to all my greatness\\": Harper's Weekly cartoon mocking Johnson on leaving office Ulysses S. Grant emerged as the likely Republican presidential candidate during the two years preceding the election. Though he had agreed to replace Stanton as Secretary of War, Grant split with Johnson over Reconstruction and other issues. So great was Grant's support among Republicans that many in Congress were reluctant to impeach Johnson due to the fear that it would prevent Grant from becoming president. Grant's backing came primarily from the moderate wing of the party, as many Radical Republicans feared that Grant would pursue conservative policies in office. The 1868 Republican National Convention chose Grant as the party's presidential nominee and Speaker of the House Schuyler Colfax as the vice presidential nominee. Perhaps chastened by Congress's failure to convict Johnson, the party's platform did not endorse universal male suffrage. Having failed to build his own party, Johnson sought nomination by the 1868 Democratic National Convention in New York in July 1868. Johnson remained very popular among Southern whites, and he boosted that popularity by issuing, just before the convention, a pardon ending the possibility of criminal proceedings against any Confederate not already indicted, meaning that only Davis and a few others still might face trial. Aside from Johnson, other contenders for the Democratic nomination included former Ohio representative George H. Pendleton, who was relatively unconcerned about Reconstruction and focused his appeal on the continued use of greenbacks, former New York governor Horatio Seymour, who had support among the party's conservative establishment but was reluctant to enter the race, and Chief Justice Salmon Chase. On the first ballot of the convention, Johnson finished second to Pendleton, and Johnson's support fell away as the ballots passed. Seymour won the nomination on the 22nd ballot, while Johnson received only four votes, all from Tennessee. For vice president, the Democrats nominated Francis Preston Blair, who campaigned on a promise to use the army to destroy the Southern governments that, he said, were led by \\"a semi-barborous race of blacks\\" who sought to \\"subject the white women to their unbridled lust.\\" The Democratic party platform embraced Johnson's presidency, thanking him for his \\"patriotic efforts\\" in \\"resisting the aggressions of Congress upon the Constitutional rights of the States and the people.\\" Nonetheless, Johnson was embittered by his defeat, and some of his backers suggested the formation of a third party. Seymour's operatives sought Johnson's support, but Johnson remained silent for most of the presidential campaign. It was not until October, with the vote already having taken place in some states, that Johnson mentioned Seymour at all, and he never endorsed him. The campaign centered largely on Reconstruction, and many Democrats hoped that a Seymour victory would lead to the end of Reconstruction and black suffrage. Republican Ulysses S. Grant defeated Democrat Horatio Seymour in the 1868 election Grant won the election, taking 52.7% of the popular vote and 214 of the 294 electoral votes. The election saw a new wave of violence across the South, as the Ku Klux Klan and other groups again sought to suppress the black vote. Seymour won Georgia and Louisiana, but Grant won the remaining former Confederate states that had been restored to the Union. Grant also carried the vast majority of Northern states, though Seymour won his home state of New York. Johnson regretted Grant's victory, in part because of their animus from the Stanton affair. In his annual message to Congress in December, Johnson urged the repeal of the Tenure of Office Act and told legislators that, had they admitted their Southern colleagues in 1865, all would have been well. On Christmas Day 1868, Johnson issued a final amnesty, this one covering everyone, including Jefferson Davis. He also issued, in his final months in office, pardons for crimes, including one for Dr. Samuel Mudd, controversially convicted of involvement in the Lincoln assassination (he had set Booth's broken leg) and imprisoned in Fort Jefferson on Florida's Dry Tortugas. In February 1869, Congress approved the Fifteenth Amendment, sending it to the states for ratification. On March 4, 1869, the final day of his presidency, Johnson refused to attend Grant's inauguration. Historical reputation In the decades after Johnson left office, there were few historical evaluations of Johnson and his presidency. Memoirs from Northerners who had dealt with him, such as former vice president Henry Wilson and Maine Senator James G. Blaine, depicted him as an obstinate boor whose Reconstruction policies favored the South. The turn of the 20th century saw the first significant historical evaluations of Johnson. Leading the wave was Pulitzer Prize-winning historian James Ford Rhodes, who ascribed Johnson's faults to his personal weaknesses, and blamed him for the problems of the postbellum South. Other early 20th- century historians, such as John Burgess, Woodrow Wilson, and William Dunning, all Southerners, concurred with Rhodes, believing Johnson flawed and politically inept, but concluding that he had tried to carry out Lincoln's plans for the South in good faith. Author and journalist Jay Tolson suggests that Wilson \\"depict[ed Reconstruction] as a vindictive program that hurt even repentant southerners while benefiting northern opportunists, the so-called Carpetbaggers, and cynical white southerners, or Scalawags, who exploited alliances with blacks for political gain\\". The grave of Andrew Johnson, Greeneville, Tennessee Even as Rhodes and his school wrote, another group of historians was setting out on the full rehabilitation of Johnson, using for the first time primary sources such as Johnson's papers and the diaries of Gideon Welles. The resulting volumes, such as David Miller DeWitt's The Impeachment and Trial of President Andrew Johnson (1903), presented him far more favorably than they did those who had sought to oust him. In James Schouler's 1913 History of the Reconstruction Period, the author accused Rhodes of being \\"quite unfair to Johnson\\", though agreeing that the former president had created many of his own problems through inept political moves. These works had an effect; although historians continued to view Johnson as having deep flaws which sabotaged his presidency, they saw his Reconstruction policies as fundamentally correct. A series of highly favorable biographies in the late 1920s and early 1930s that \\"glorified Johnson and condemned his enemies\\" accelerated this trend. In 1948, a poll of historians conducted by Arthur M. Schlesinger deemed Johnson among the average presidents; in 1956, one by Clinton L. Rossiter named him as one of the near-great chief executives. Foner notes that at the time of these surveys, \\"the Reconstruction era that followed the Civil War was regarded as a time of corruption and misgovernment caused by granting black men the right to vote\\". In the 1950s, historians began to focus on the African-American experience as central to Reconstruction. They rejected completely any claim of black inferiority, which had marked many earlier historical works. Many of these writers saw the developing Civil Rights Movement as a second Reconstruction and hoped their work on the postbellum era would advance the cause of civil rights. These authors sympathized with the Radical Republicans for their desire to help African Americans, and saw Johnson as callous towards the freedman. In a number of works from 1956 onwards by such historians as Fawn Brodie, the former president was depicted as a successful saboteur of efforts to better the freedman's lot. Reconstruction was increasingly seen as a noble effort to integrate the freed slaves into society. In the early 21st century, Johnson is among those commonly mentioned as the worst presidents in U.S. history. According to historian Glenn W. Lafantasie, who believes Buchanan the worst president, \\"Johnson is a particular favorite for the bottom of the pile because of his impeachment ... his complete mishandling of Reconstruction policy ... his bristling personality, and his enormous sense of self- importance.\\" Tolson suggests that \\"Johnson is now scorned for having resisted Radical Republican policies aimed at securing the rights and well-being of the newly emancipated African-Americans\\". Gordon-Reed notes that Johnson, along with his contemporaries Pierce and Buchanan, are generally listed among the five worst presidents, but states, \\"there have never been more difficult times in the life of this nation. The problems these men had to confront were enormous. It would have taken a succession of Lincolns to do them justice.\\" Trefousse considers Johnson's legacy to be \\"the maintenance of white supremacy. His boost to Southern conservatives by undermining Reconstruction was his legacy to the nation, one that would trouble the country for generations to come.\\" A 2018 poll of the American Political Science Association's Presidents and Executive Politics section ranked Johnson as the seventh-worst president. A 2017 C-Span poll of historians ranked Johnson as the second-worst president. A 2006 poll of historians ranked Johnson's decision to oppose greater equality for African Americans in the aftermath of the Civil War as the second-worst mistake ever made by a sitting president.

Taft, a Republican from Ohio, was the 27th United States president. The protégé and chosen successor of President Theodore Roosevelt, he took office after easily defeating Democrat William Jennings Bryan in the 1908 presidential election. His presidency ended with his defeat in the 1912 election by Democrat Woodrow Wilson. The Taft administration sought reductions to trade tariffs, then a major source of governmental income, but the Payne–Aldrich Tariff Act of 1909 raised rates when most people expected reductions. Taft continued and expanded his predecessor's efforts to break up trusts, launching cases against U.S. Steel and other companies. Taft made six appointments to the United States Supreme Court, more than all but two other presidents. In foreign affairs, Taft focused on China and Japan, and repeatedly intervened to prop up or remove Latin American governments. His administration sought to uphold the Monroe Doctrine followed policy of Dollar Diplomacy, using U.S. investment to enhance bolster influence in Latin America and Asia. His administration was filled with conflict between the conservative wing of the Republican Party, with which Taft often sympathized, and the progressive wing, toward which Roosevelt moved more and more during Taft's presidency. Controversies over conservation and over antitrust cases filed by the Taft administration served to further separate the two men. Roosevelt challenged Taft at the 1912 Republican National Convention, but Taft was able to use his control of the party machinery to narrowly win his party's nomination. After the convention, Roosevelt left the party, formed the Progressive Party, and ran against Taft and Wilson the 1912 election. This split among Republicans doomed Taft's chances for re-election, giving Democrats control of the White House for the first time in sixteen years as well as Congress. Historians generally consider Taft to have been an average president. Election of 1908 One of a series of candid photographs known as the Evolution of a Smile, as Taft learns by telephone from Roosevelt of his nomination for president. After his victory in the 1904 presidential election, Theodore Roosevelt announced that he would not seek re-election in 1908. Roosevelt considered Secretary of War Taft to be his logical successor, although Taft was initially reluctant to run, and would have preferred being appointed to the position of chief justice of the Supreme Court. Roosevelt used his control of the party machinery to aid his heir apparent, and Roosevelt's political appointees were required to support Taft or remain silent. A number of Republican politicians, such as Treasury Secretary George Cortelyou, tested the waters for a run but chose to stay out. New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes ran, but when he made a major policy speech, Roosevelt took steps to minimize coverage of Hughes's candidacy. Taft faced no serious opposition at the 1908 Republican National Convention and he won the presidential nomination on the first ballot. Taft hoped his running mate would be a Midwestern progressive like Iowa Senator Jonathan Dolliver, but instead the convention named Congressman James S. Sherman of New York, a conservative. Taft resigned as Secretary of War on June 30 to devote himself full-time to the campaign. 1908 Taft/Sherman poster Taft began the campaign on the wrong foot, fueling the arguments of those who said he was not his own man by traveling to Roosevelt's home at Sagamore Hill for advice on his acceptance speech, saying that he needed \\"the president's judgment and criticism\\". Taft supported most of Roosevelt's policies. He argued that labor had a right to organize, but not boycott, and that corporations and the wealthy must also obey the law. Taft attributed blame for the recent recession, the Panic of 1907, to stock speculation and other abuses, and felt some reform of the currency (the U.S. was on the gold standard) was needed to allow flexibility in the government's response to poor economic times. He also spoke out in favor of revisions to tariff rates and favored strengthening the Sherman Antitrust Act. Taft's opponent in the general election was William Jennings Bryan, the Democratic nominee for the third time in four presidential elections. He campaigned on a progressive platform attacking \\"government by privilege\\", and portraying Republicans as beholden to powerful corporate interests and to the wealthy. As many of Roosevelt's reforms stemmed from his proposals, the Democrat argued that he was the true heir to Roosevelt's mantle. 1908 electoral vote results. During the fall campaign Roosevelt showered Taft with advice and infused energy into his campaign. Consequently, accusations abounded that the president was in effect running Taft's campaign. His larger-than-life presence in the campaign also caught the attention of journalists and humorists who bombarded the public with jokes about Taft being nothing but a Roosevelt stand-in; one suggested that \\"T.A.F.T.\\" stood for \\"Take Advice From Theodore. In the end, Taft defeated Bryan by 321 electoral votes to 162, carrying all but three states outside the Democratic Solid South. He also won the popular vote by a comfortable margin, receiving 7,675,320 votes (51.6 percent) to Bryan's 6,412,294 (43.1 percent); Socialist Party candidate Eugene V. Debs won 420,793 votes (2.8 percent). Nellie Taft said regarding the campaign, \\"There was nothing to criticize, except his not knowing or caring about the way the game of politics is played.\\" Roosevelt, meanwhile, left office with regret that his tenure in the position he enjoyed so much was over. To keep out of Taft's way, he arranged for a year-long hunting trip to Africa. Inauguration Taft's presidential inauguration was held on March 4, 1909. Due to a winter storm that coated Washington with ice, Taft was sworn in within the Senate Chamber rather than outside the Capitol, as is customary. The new president stated in his inaugural address that he had been honored to have been \\"one of the advisers of my distinguished predecessor\\" and to have had a part \\"in the reforms he has initiated. I should be untrue to myself, to my promises, and to the declarations of the party platform on which I was elected if I did not make the maintenance and enforcement of those reforms a most important feature of my administration\\". He pledged to make those reforms long-lasting, ensuring that honest businessmen did not suffer uncertainty through change of policy. He spoke of the need for reduction of the 1897 Dingley Tariff, for antitrust reform, and for continued advancement of the Philippines toward full self-government. Administration Cabinet Taft, seated at center, and his cabinet (September 1910), left to right: Richard Achilles Ballinger, George von Lengerke Meyer, Philander C. Knox, Charles Dyer Norton, Frank Harris Hitchcock, James Wilson, Franklin MacVeagh, George W. Wickersham, Charles Nagel During the 1908 campaign, Taft and Roosevelt had discussed which Cabinet officers would stay on, but Taft kept only Agriculture Secretary James Wilson and George von Lengerke Meyer. Meyer was shifted from the position of Postmaster General to the position of Secretary of the Navy. Taft also asked Secretary of State Elihu Root to remain in his position, but Root declined and instead recommended former Attorney General Philander C. Knox for the position. Others appointed to the Taft's inaugural Cabinet include Secretary of the Interior Richard A. Ballinger, Secretary of the Treasury Franklin MacVeagh, Secretary of War Jacob M. Dickinson, Postmaster General Frank Harris Hitchcock, Secretary of Commerce and Labor Charles Nagel, and Attorney General George W. Wickersham. In 1911, Henry L. Stimson replaced Dickinson, and Walter L. Fisher replaced Ballinger. Vice Presidency James S. Sherman had been added to the 1908 Republican ticket as a means to appease the conservative wing of the GOP, which viewed Taft as a progressive. As Taft moved to the right during his presidency, Sherman emerged an important ally to the president. Nominated for a second term at the 1912 Republican National Convention, he became ill during the campaign and died on October 30, 1912, just prior to the election. As the Constitution lacked a mechanism for choosing an intra-term replacement prior to ratification of the Twenty-fifth Amendment in 1967, the vice presidency remained vacant for the final days of Taft's presidency. During that time, Secretary of State Philander C. Knox was next in line to the presidency, per the Presidential Succession Act of 1886. Press corps Taft did not enjoy the easy relationship with the press that Roosevelt had, choosing not to offer himself for interviews or photo opportunities as often as his predecessor had. His administration marked a change in style from the charismatic leadership of Roosevelt to Taft's quieter passion for the rule of law. Judicial appointments Taft appointed Edward Douglass White to be Chief Justice of the United States. Taft himself succeeded White as Chief Justice in 1921. Taft made six appointments to the Supreme Court, the most of any president except George Washington and Franklin D. Roosevelt. He appointed Horace H. Lurton in 1909, Charles Evans Hughes, Willis Van Devanter, Joseph R. Lamar, and Joseph R. Lamar in 1910, and Mahlon Pitney in 1912. Additionally, Taft elevated Associate Justice Edward Douglass White to the position of chief justice in 1910. The Supreme Court under Chief Justice White proved to be less conservative than both the preceding Fuller Court and the succeeding Taft Court, although the court continued to strike down numerous economic regulations as part of the Lochner era. Three of Taft's appointees had left the court by 1917, while Pitney and White remained on the court until the early 1920s. The conservative Van Devanter was the lone Taft appointee to serve past 1922, and he formed part of the Four Horsemen bloc that opposed Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. Taft himself would succeed White as Chief Justice in 1921, and he served with Pitney and Van Devanter on the Taft Court. Taft also appointed 13 judges to the federal courts of appeal and 38 judges to the United States district courts. Taft also appointed judges to various specialized courts, including the first five appointees each to the United States Commerce Court and the United States Court of Customs Appeals. searches run from page, \\"select research categories\\" then check \\"court type\\" and \\"nominating president\\", then select the court type and also William H. Taft. Domestic affairs Tariffs and taxation =Payne-Aldrich Tariff= Immediately following his inauguration, Taft called a special session of Congress to convene in March 1909 for the purpose of revising the tariff schedules. Rates at the time were set in accordance with the 1897 Dingley Act, and were the highest in U.S. history. The Republican Party had made the high tariff the central plank of their economic policy since the end of the Civil War, but Taft and some other Republicans had come to believe that the Dingley Act had set the rates too high. Though the high tariff protected domestic manufacturing, it also hurt U.S. exports and raised the cost of living for the average American. Many saw the tariff as a de facto regressive tax on consumers, but favored policies that would shift the tax burden to corporations and high earners. While Roosevelt had largely avoided the tariff issue, Taft became the first Republican president to actively seek to lower tariff rates. Man of congress Sereno E. Payne, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and an ally of conservative Speaker of the House Joseph Gurney Cannon, took charge of drafting tariff legislation. On balance, the bill Payne introduced reduced tariffs slightly, but not nearly as much as Taft and progressive Republicans preferred. Payne's bill passed the House in April 1909; when it reached the Senate, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Nelson W. Aldrich, attached numerous amendments that raised tariff rates. Aldrich's amendments outraged progressives such as Wisconsin's Robert M. La Follette, who strongly opposed the high rates of the Payne-Aldrich tariff bill. Facing pressure from progressive senators to add an income tax to the bill, Taft and Aldrich instead arranged for Senator Henry Cabot Lodge to add another amendment to the bill containing a two percent tax on corporate incomes over $5,000. Following the insertion of that amendment, the bill passed the Senate and went to a conference committee, where minor reductions were made to tariff rates and the corporate income tax rate was lowered from two percent to one percent. Despite his disappointment with the high tariff rates contained in the final bill, Taft signed the Payne-Aldrich tariff into law. Estimates vary on the overall average tariff rate reductions contained in the final bill; some estimates found that it would bring ad valorem tariff rates down from an average of approximately 40.2 percent to approximately 37 percent, but others asserted that it actually raised average rates. The corporate tax was the first such tax ever implemented by the federal government in peacetime, and it would produce about four percent of the federal government's revenue between 1909 and 1913. Opponents of the tax tried to have the Supreme Court declare it unconstitutional, but the tax was upheld in the 1911 case of Flint v. Stone Tracy Co. Despite the inclusion of that tax, the Payne-Aldrich tariff greatly disappointed progressive Republicans, and the resulting disharmony in the Republican Party received widespread exposure in the press, providing the Democrats with a powerful campaign issue for the 1910 congressional elections. The intra-party divisions that opened during the tariff debate would plague the Republican Party for the remainder of Taft's presidency. =Sixteenth Amendment= During the debate over the Payne-Aldrich tariff in mid-1909, Congress passed a resolution proposing a constitutional amendment that would allow the federal government to levy an income tax without having to apportion that tax among the states. The amendment would essentially overturn the Supreme Court's ruling in the 1895 case of Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., thereby allowing Congress to implement an income tax without the possibility of it being struck down by the Supreme Court. Passage of the amendment helped appease progressive opponents of the Payne-Aldrich tariff and helped ensure that the act passed Congress. Conservative leaders in Congress largely opposed the actual ratification of the amendment, but they believed that it had little chance of being ratified, as ratification required approval by three quarters of the state legislatures. Taft himself favored proposing the amendment to the state legislatures largely because he believed that passing an income tax after the Supreme Court's ruling in Pollock could potentially lead to inter-branch conflict and undermine the legitimacy of the Supreme Court. After Congress proposed the amendment, conservative Republican leaders, as well as businessmen like John D. Rockefeller, organized efforts to prevent its ratification. These conservative forces were initially confident that over a quarter of the state legislature would reject the income tax amendment, but the country shifted in a progressive direction after 1909. Numerous conservative state legislators lost power during the 1910 and 1912 election cycles, and the imposition of taxes in Wisconsin and other states served as evidence of the viability of a federal income tax. On February 3, 1913, Wyoming became the 36th state to approve the amendment, and later that month Secretary of State Knox declared that the United States had ratified the Sixteenth Amendment. After Taft left office, a new federal income tax was imposed through the Revenue Act of 1913. Antitrust Taft expanded Roosevelt's efforts to break up business combinations through lawsuits brought under the Sherman Antitrust Act, bringing 70 cases in four years (Roosevelt had brought 40 in seven years). Suits brought against the Standard Oil Company and the American Tobacco Company, initiated under Roosevelt, were decided in favor of the government by the Supreme Court in 1911. In June 1911, the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives began hearings into U.S. Steel. Roosevelt had supported U.S. Steel's acquisition of the Tennessee Coal, Iron, and Railroad Company as a means of preventing the deepening of the Panic of 1907, a decision the former president defended when testifying at the hearings. Taft, as Secretary of War, had praised the acquisitions. In October 1911, Taft's Justice Department brought suit against U.S. Steel, demanding that over a hundred of its subsidiaries be granted corporate independence, and naming as defendants many prominent business executives and financiers. The pleadings in the case had not been reviewed by Taft, and alleged that Roosevelt \\"had fostered monopoly, and had been duped by clever industrialists\\". Roosevelt was offended by the references to him and his administration in the pleadings, and felt that Taft could not evade command responsibility by saying he did not know of them. Historian Louis L. Gould suggests that Roosevelt was likely deceived into believing that U.S. Steel did not want to purchase the Tennessee company, but it was in fact a bargain. Taft sent a special message to Congress on the need for a revamped antitrust statute when it convened its regular session in December 1911, but it took no action. Another antitrust case that had political repercussions for Taft was that brought against the International Harvester Company, the large manufacturer of farm equipment, in early 1912. As Roosevelt's administration had investigated International Harvester, but had taken no action (a decision Taft had supported), the suit became caught up in Roosevelt's challenge for the Republican presidential nomination. Supporters of Taft alleged that Roosevelt had acted improperly; the former president blasted Taft for waiting three and a half years, and until he was under challenge, to reverse a decision he had supported. Ballinger–Pinchot affair Puck magazine cover: Roosevelt departs, entrusting his policies to Taft Roosevelt was an ardent conservationist, assisted in this by like- minded appointees, including Interior Secretary James R. Garfield and Chief Forester Gifford Pinchot. Taft agreed with the need for conservation, but felt it should be accomplished by legislation rather than executive order. He did not retain Garfield, an Ohioan, as secretary, choosing instead a westerner, former Seattle mayor Richard Ballinger. Roosevelt was surprised at the replacement, believing that Taft had promised to keep Garfield. Roosevelt had withdrawn much land from the public domain, including some in Alaska thought rich in coal. In 1902, Idaho entrepreneur Clarence Cunningham had made mining claims to coal deposits in Alaska, and a government investigation into the matter lasted throughout Roosevelt's presidency. During part of that investigation, Ballinger served as head of the General Land Office. When Ballinger, now Secretary of the Interior, finally approved the claims in 1909, Land Office agent Louis Glavis broke governmental protocol by going outside the Interior Department to seek help from Pinchot. In September 1909, Glavis made his allegations public in a magazine article, disclosing that Ballinger had acted as an attorney for Cunningham between his two periods of government service. This violated conflict of interest rules forbidding a former government official from advocacy on a matter he had been responsible for. On September 13, 1909, Taft dismissed Glavis from government service, relying on a report from Attorney General Wickersham dated two days previously. He also ordered government officials not to comment on the fracas. Pinchot was determined to dramatize the issue by forcing his own dismissal, which Taft tried to avoid, fearing that it might cause a break with Roosevelt. Taft asked Senator Elihu Root to look into the matter, and Root urged the firing of Pinchot. In January 1910, Pinchot forced the issue by sending a letter to Senator Jonathan Dolliver alleging that but for the actions of the Forestry Service, Taft would have approved a fraudulent claim on public lands. According to Pringle, this \\"was an utterly improper appeal from an executive subordinate to the legislative branch of the government and an unhappy president prepared to separate Pinchot from public office\\". Pinchot was dismissed, much to his delight, and he sailed for Europe to lay his case before Roosevelt. A congressional investigation followed, which cleared Ballinger by majority vote, but the administration was embarrassed when Glavis' attorney, Louis D. Brandeis, proved that the Wickersham report had been backdated, which Taft belatedly admitted. The Ballinger–Pinchot affair caused progressives and Roosevelt loyalists to feel that Taft had turned his back on Roosevelt's agenda.  Civil rights  Taft announced in his inaugural address that he would not appoint African Americans to federal jobs, such as postmaster, where this would cause racial friction. This differed from Roosevelt, who would not remove or replace black officeholders with whom local whites would not deal. Termed Taft's \\"Southern Policy\\", this stance effectively invited white protests against black appointees. Taft followed through, removing most black office holders in the South, and made few appointments from that race in the North. At the time Taft was inaugurated, the way forward for African Americans was debated by their leaders. Booker T. Washington felt that most blacks should be trained for industrial work, with only a few seeking higher education; W.E.B. DuBois took a more militant stand for equality. Taft tended towards Washington's approach. According to Coletta, Taft let the African-American \\"be 'kept in his place' ... He thus failed to see or follow the humanitarian mission historically associated with the Republican party, with the result that Negroes both North and South began to drift toward the Democratic party.\\"  Other initiatives  Taft sought greater regulation of railroads, and he proposed the creation of the United States Commerce Court to hear appeals from the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), which provided federal oversight to railroads and other common carriers engaged in interstate commerce. The Mann–Elkins Act established the Commerce Court and increased the authority of the ICC, placing telegraph and telephone companies under its authority and allowing it to set price ceilings on rail fares. The Commerce Court proved to be unpopular with members of Congress, and it was abolished in 1913. Taft proposed that the Post Office Department act as a bank that would accept small deposits. Though the idea was opposed by conservative Republicans such as Senator Aldrich and Speaker of the House Joseph Cannon, Taft won passage of a law establishing the United States Postal Savings System. Taft also oversaw the establishment of a domestic parcel post delivery system. The results from the 1910 midterm elections were disappointing to the president, as Democrats took control of the House and many of Taft's preferred candidates were defeated. The election was a major victory for progressives in both parties, and ultimately helped encourage Roosevelt's 1912 third party run. Taft was also disappointed by the defeat of Warren G. Harding in the 1910 Ohio gubernatorial race, while in New Jersey, Democrat Woodrow Wilson was elected governor. With a divided government, the second half of Taft's term saw the passage of much less legislation than the first. Direct election of senators For the first 125 years of the federal government's existence, Americans did not directly vote for U.S. Senators. The Constitution, as it was adopted in 1788, stated that senators would be elected by state legislatures. During the 1890s, the House of Representatives passed several resolutions proposing a constitutional amendment for the direct election of senators, but the Senate refused to even take a vote on such a measure. A number of states began calling for a constitutional convention on the subject, since Article V of the Constitution states that Congress must call a constitutional convention for proposing amendments when two-thirds of the state legislatures apply for one. By 1912, 27 states had called for a constitutional convention on the subject, with 31 states needed to reach the threshold. As the number of applications neared the two-thirds threshold, the Senate abandoned its strategy of obstruction. An amendment to the Constitution establishing the popular election of United States Senators by the people of the states was approved by Congress on May 13, 1912, and submitted to the state legislatures for ratification. By April 8, 1913 it had been ratified by the requisite number of states (36) to become the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. States admitted to the Union Since Oklahoma's admission in 1907, there had been 46 states in the union, with New Mexico Territory and Arizona Territory the only remaining territories in the Contiguous United States. The Enabling Act of 1906 would have allowed Arizona and New Mexico to join the union as one state, but Arizona had voted against the combination in a referendum. In 1910, New Mexico and Arizona both wrote a constitution in anticipation of statehood, and Arizona's constitution included progressive ideas such as initiative, referendum, and recall. Taft opposed these mechanisms, particularly the ability to recall judges, and he vetoed Arizona's statehood bill. Without any such constitutional issues, New Mexico joined the union as the 47th state on January 6, 1912. After Arizona wrote a new constitution removing the power to recall judges, Taft signed a bill admitting Arizona on February 14, 1912. Foreign affairs Taft was well-educated in foreign affairs, from his academic studies of international arbitration, to his administration of the Philippines, and especially his service as Secretary of War. His main innovation was to downplay the use of physical power and threats of power, and emphasize the nation's rapidly growing economic power. He called that \\"Dollar Diplomacy. It played a role in China and Latin America. He negotiated a reciprocity treaty for freer trade with Canada, but it became enmeshed in Canadian politics and was rejected. He became thoroughly entangled in domestic politics on the tariff issue, and the result divided his party.Paolo E.

Organization and principles Taft made it a priority to restructure the State Department, noting, \\"it is organized on the basis of the needs of the government in 1800 instead of 1900.\\" The department was for the first time organized into geographical divisions, including desks for the Far East, Latin America and Western Europe. The department's first in- service training program was established, and appointees spent a month in Washington before going to their posts. Taft and Secretary of State Knox had a strong relationship, and the president listened to his counsel on matters foreign and domestic. According to Coletta, however, Knox was not a good diplomat, and had poor relations with the Senate, press, and many foreign leaders, especially those from Latin America. There was broad agreement between Taft and Knox on major foreign policy goals.Richard H. Collin \\"Symbiosis versus Hegemony: New Directions in the Foreign Relations Historiography of Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft.\\" Diplomatic History 19.3 (1995): 473-497. online The U.S. would not interfere in European affairs, and would use force if necessary to uphold the Monroe Doctrine in the Americas. The defense of the Panama Canal, which was under construction throughout Taft's term (it opened in 1914), guided policy in the Caribbean and Central America. Previous administrations had made efforts to promote American business interests overseas, but Taft went a step further and used the web of American diplomats and consuls abroad to further trade. Such ties, Taft hoped, would promote world peace. Unlike his predecessor, Taft did not seek to arbitrate conflicts among the other great powers. Taft avoided involvement in international events such as the Agadir Crisis, the Italo-Turkish War, and the First Balkan War. However, Taft did express support for the creation of an international arbitration tribunal and called for an international arms reduction agreement. Proposed free trade accord with Canada Newton McConnell cartoon showing Canadian suspicions that Taft and others were only interested in Canada when prosperous. Partly due to the backlash over the high rates of the Payne-Aldrich Tariff, Taft urged the adoption of a free trade accord with Canada. Britain at that time still handled Canada's foreign relations, and Taft found the British and Canadian governments willing to engage in negotiations. Many in Canada opposed an accord, fearing the U.S. would discard it when convenient, as it had the Elgin-Marcy Treaty in 1866. American farm and fisheries interests were also opposed to the treaty. Nonetheless, Taft reached an agreement with Canadian officials in early 1911, and Congress approved it in late July. The Canadian Parliament, led by Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier, deadlocked over the issue, and the Canadians turned Laurier out of office in the September 1911 election. No cross-border agreement was concluded, and the debate deepened divisions in the Republican Party. Central America Taft and Porfirio Díaz, Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, 1909 Taft and Secretary of State Knox instituted a policy of Dollar Diplomacy towards Latin America, believing U.S. investment would benefit all involved and minimize European influence in the area. Although exports rose sharply during Taft's administration, his Dollar Diplomacy policy was unpopular among Latin American states that did not wish to become financial protectorates of the United States. Dollar Diplomacy also faced opposition in the U.S. Senate, as many senators believed the U.S. should not interfere abroad. In Nicaragua, American diplomats quietly favored rebel forces under Juan J. Estrada against the government of President José Santos Zelaya, who wanted to revoke commercial concessions granted to American companies. Secretary Knox was reportedly a major stockholder in one of the companies that would be hurt by such a move. The country was in debt to several foreign powers, and the U.S. was unwilling to have it (along with its alternate canal route) fall into the hands of Europeans. Zelaya and his elected successor, José Madriz, were unable to put down the rebellion, and in August 1910, Estrada's forces took the capital of Managua. The U.S. had Nicaragua accept a loan, and sent officials to ensure it was repaid from government revenues. The country remained unstable, and after another coup in 1911 and more disturbances in 1912, Taft sent troops; though most were soon withdrawn, some remained as late as 1933. Treaties among Panama, Colombia, and the United States to resolve disputes arising from the Panamanian Revolution of 1903 had been signed by the lame- duck Roosevelt administration in early 1909, and were approved by the Senate and also ratified by Panama. Colombia, however, declined to ratify the treaties, and after the 1912 elections, Knox offered $10 million to the Colombians (later raised to $25 million). The Colombians felt the amount inadequate, and the matter was not settled under the Taft administration. Mexico No foreign affairs controversy tested Taft's statesmanship and commitment to peace more than the collapse of the Mexican regime and subsequent turmoil of the Mexican Revolution. When Taft entered office, Mexico was increasingly restless under the longtime dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz. Díaz faced strong political opposition from Francisco Madero, who was backed by a sizeable proportion of the population, and was also confronted with serious social unrest sparked by Emiliano Zapata in the south and by Pancho Villa in the north. In October 1909, Taft and Díaz exchanged visits across the Mexico–United States border, at El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. Their meetings were the first ever between a U.S. and a Mexican president, and also represented the first time an American president visited Mexico. Diaz hoped to use the meeting as a propaganda tool to show that his government had the U.S.'s unconditional support. For his part, Taft was mainly interested in protecting American corporate investments in Mexico. The symbolically important meetings helped pave the way for the start of construction on the Elephant Butte Dam project in 1911. The situation in Mexico deteriorated throughout 1910, and there were a number of incidents in which Mexican rebels crossed the U.S. border to obtain horses and weapons. After Díaz jailed opposition candidate Madero prior to the 1910 presidential election, Madero's supporters responded by taking up arms against the government. This unrest resulted in both the ousting of Díaz and a revolution that would continue for another ten years. In the Arizona Territory, two citizens were killed and almost a dozen injured, some as a result of gunfire across the border. Taft would not be goaded into fighting and so instructed the territorial governor not to respond to provocations. In March 1911, he sent 20,000 American troops up to the Mexican border to protect American citizens and financial investments in Mexico. He told his military aide, Archibald Butt, that \\"I am going to sit on the lid and it will take a great deal to pry me off\\". Far East Having served as the governor of the Philippines, Taft was keenly interested in Asian-Pacific affairs. Because of the potential for trade and investment, Taft ranked the post of minister to China as most important in the Foreign Service. Knox did not agree, and declined a suggestion that he go to Peking to view the facts on the ground. Taft replaced Roosevelt's minister there, William W. Rockhill, as uninterested in the China trade, with William J. Calhoun, whom McKinley and Roosevelt had sent on several foreign missions. Knox did not listen to Calhoun on policy, and there were often conflicts. Taft and Knox tried unsuccessfully to extend John Hay's Open Door Policy to Manchuria. In 1909, a British-led consortium began negotiations to finance a railroad from Hankow and Szechuan. Taft appealed personally to the Prince Regent, Zaifeng, Prince Chun, and was successful in gaining U.S. participation in the financing of the railroads. However, the Chinese decree authorizing the agreement also required the nationalization of local railroad companies in the affected provinces. Inadequate compensation was paid to the shareholders, and these grievances were among those which touched off the Chinese Revolution of 1911. After the Chinese Revolution broke out, the revolt's leaders chose Sun Yat Sen as provisional president of what became the Republic of China, overthrowing the Manchu Dynasty. Taft was reluctant to recognize the new government, although American public opinion was in favor of it. The U.S. House of Representatives in February 1912 passed a resolution supporting a Chinese republic, but Taft and Knox felt recognition should come as a concerted action by Western powers. In his final annual message to Congress in December 1912, Taft indicated that he was moving towards recognition once the republic was fully established, but by then he had been defeated for re- election and he did not follow through. Taft continued the policy against immigration from China and Japan as under Roosevelt. A revised treaty of friendship and navigation entered into by the U.S. and Japan in 1911 granted broad reciprocal rights to Japanese in America and Americans in Japan, but were premised on the continuation of the Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907. There was objection on the West Coast when the treaty was submitted to the Senate, but Taft informed politicians that there was no change in immigration policy. Arbitration Taft favored settling international disputes via arbitration, and in 1911 Taft and Secretary of State Knox negotiated major treaties with Great Britain and France providing that differences be arbitrated. Neither Taft nor Knox consulted with members of the Senate during the negotiating process. By then many Republicans were opposed to Taft, and the president felt that lobbying too hard for the treaties might cause their defeat. He made some speeches supporting the treaties in October 1911, but the Senate added amendments Taft could not accept, killing the agreements. Roosevelt worked with his close friend, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, to impose the Senate amendments. Lodge thought that the treaties impinged on senatorial prerogatives,Robert J. Fischer, \\"Henry Cabot Lodge and the Taft Arbitration Treaties.\\" South Atlantic Quarterly 78 (Spring 1979): 244-58. while Roosevelt sought to sabotage Taft's campaign promisesE. James Hindman, \\"The General Arbitration Treaties of William Howard Taft.\\" Historian 36.1 (1973): 52-65. online and believed that arbitration was a naïve solution and that great issues had to be decided by warfare.John P. Campbell, \\"Taft, Roosevelt, and the Arbitration Treaties of 1911,\\" Journal of American History (1966) 53#2 pp: 279-298 in JSTOR. Although no general arbitration treaty was entered into, Taft's administration settled several disputes with Great Britain by peaceful means, often involving arbitration. These included a settlement of the boundary between Maine and New Brunswick, a long-running dispute over seal hunting in the Bering Sea that also involved Japan, and a similar disagreement regarding fishing off Newfoundland. Moving apart from Roosevelt The arbitration issue opens a window on a bitter dispute among progressives. Taft and many progressives looked to legal arbitration as an alternative to warfare. Roosevelt—a warrior not a lawyer—rejected that line of thought as the product of a too-soft business culture.John P. Mallan, \\"Roosevelt, Brooks Adams, and Lea: The Warrior Critique of the Business Civilization.\\" American Quarterly 8.3 (1956): 216-230. online Taft was a constitutional lawyer who later became Chief Justice; he had a deep understanding of the legal issues.John E. Noyes, \\"William Howard Taft and the Taft Arbitration Treaties.\\" Villanova Law Review 56 (2011): 535+ online. Taft's political base was the conservative business community which largely supported arbitration and often talked peace. His mistake in this case was a failure to fully mobilize that base. The businessmen believed that economic rivalries were cause of war, and that extensive trade led to an interdependent world that would make war a very expensive and useless anachronism. One early success came in the Newfoundland fisheries dispute between the United States and Britain in 1910. Taft's 1911 treaties with France and Britain were killed by Roosevelt, who had broken with his protégé in 1910. War and peace became issues in their duel for control of the Republican Party. At a deeper level, Roosevelt truly believed that arbitration was a naïve solution and that great issues had to be decided by warfare. The Rooseveltian approach had a near-mystical faith in the ennobling nature of war. It endorsed jingoistic nationalism as opposed to the businessmen's calculation of profit and national interest. During Roosevelt's fifteen months in Europe and Africa, from March 1909 to June 1910, neither man wrote much to the other. Taft biographer Lurie suggested that each expected the other to make the first move to re-establish their relationship on a new footing. Upon Roosevelt's triumphant return, Taft invited him to stay at the White House. The former president declined, and in private letters to friends expressed dissatisfaction at Taft's performance. Nevertheless, he wrote that he expected Taft to be renominated by the Republicans in 1912, and did not speak of himself as a candidate. Taft and Roosevelt met twice in 1910; the meetings, though superficially cordial, did not display their former closeness. Roosevelt gave a series of speeches in the West in the late summer and early fall of 1910. Roosevelt not only attacked the Supreme Court's 1905 decision in Lochner v. New York, he accused the federal courts of undermining democracy, and called for them to be deprived of the power to rule legislation unconstitutional. This attack horrified Taft, who privately agreed that Lochner had been wrongly decided but strongly supported judicial review. Roosevelt called for the \\"elimination of corporate expenditures for political purposes, physical valuation of railroad properties, regulation of industrial combinations, establishment of an export tariff commission, a graduated income tax ... workmen's compensation laws, state and national legislation to regulate the [labor] of women and children, and complete publicity of campaign expenditure\\". John Murphy writes that, \\"as Roosevelt began to move to the left, Taft veered to the right.\\" Taft had become increasingly associated with the conservative \\"Old Guard\\" faction of the party, and progressive Republicans such as Wisconsin Senator Robert La Follette became dissatisfied Taft's leadership. La Follette and his followers formed the National Republican Progressive League as a platform to challenge Taft in 1912 presidential election, either for the Republican nomination or in the general election as a third party. Election of 1912 Republican nomination Taft and Roosevelt – political enemies in 1912 After the 1910 elections, Roosevelt continued to promote progressive ideals, a New Nationalism, much to Taft's dismay. Roosevelt attacked his successor's administration, arguing that its guiding principles were not that of the party of Lincoln, but those of the Gilded Age. The feud continued on and off through 1911, a year in which there were few elections of significance. Backed by many progressives, La Follette announced a run for the 1912 Republican nomination. Roosevelt received many letters from supporters urging him to run, and Republican office-holders were organizing on his behalf. Roosevelt believed these manifestations of public support represented a broader movement that would sweep him to the White House with a mandate to implement progressive policies. In February 1912, Roosevelt announced he would accept the Republican nomination if it was offered to him, and many progressives abandoned La Follette's candidacy and threw their support behind Roosevelt. As Roosevelt became more radical in his progressivism, Taft was hardened in his resolve to achieve re-nomination, as he was convinced that the progressives threatened the very foundation of the government. While Roosevelt attacked both parties as corrupt and overly dependent on special interests, Taft feared that Roosevelt was becoming a demagogue. Despite Roosevelt's popularity, Taft still held the loyalty of many Republican leaders, giving him a major advantage in the race for delegates. In an effort to shore up his support, Taft hit the campaign trail, becoming the first sitting president to do so during a primary campaign. Roosevelt dominated the primaries, winning 278 of the 362 Republican delegates selected in primaries, but Taft's control of the party machinery proved critical in helping him win the bulk of the delegates decided at district or state conventions. At the start of the 1912 Republican National Convention, Roosevelt challenged the election of many pro-Taft Southern delegates, but the RNC overruled most objections. Roosevelt's sole remaining chance to win the Republican nomination was through the election of a friendly convention chairman, but Elihu Root, by then a Taft ally, won election as chairman. Root made a crucial ruling that allowed contested delegates to vote on the seating of other contested delegates; a motion to defeat this ruling was offered by Roosevelt forces, but it failed in a 567–507 vote. As it became clear Roosevelt would bolt the party if not nominated, some Republicans sought a compromise candidate to avert the electoral disaster to come; they were unsuccessful. Taft's name was placed in nomination by Warren Harding, whose attempts to praise Taft and unify the party were met with angry interruptions from progressives. Taft was nominated on the first ballot, though most Roosevelt delegates refused to vote. Vice President Sherman was also nominated for a second term, making him the first incumbent vice president to win re- nomination since John C. Calhoun in 1828. General election 1912 Electoral vote by state. Alleging Taft had stolen the nomination, Roosevelt and his followers formed the Progressive Party, commonly known as the \\"Bull Moose Party.\\" Taft knew he would almost certainly be defeated, but concluded that through Roosevelt's loss at Chicago the party had been preserved as \\"the defender of conservative government and conservative institutions.\\" Seeing Roosevelt as the greater electoral threat, Democratic nominee Wilson spent little time attacking Taft, arguing that Roosevelt had been lukewarm in opposing the trusts during his presidency, and that Wilson was the true reformer. Reverting to the 19th century custom that presidents seeking re- election did not campaign, Taft retreated to the golf links. He spoke publicly only once, when making his nomination acceptance speech on August 1. He had difficulty in financing the campaign, as many industrialists had concluded he could not win and chose to support Wilson in order to block Roosevelt. Any remaining sense of optimism within the campaign evaporated when Vice President Sherman became seriously ill in October, and died six days before the election. In January (two months after the election), the Republican National Committee named Columbia University president Nicholas Murray Butler to replace Sherman and to receive his electoral votes. Taft won only Utah and Vermont, for a total of eight electoral votes, which set a record for electoral vote futility by a Republican candidate that was later matched by Alf Landon in the 1936 election. Roosevelt won 88 electoral votes, while Wilson won 435; Wilson's share of the electoral vote represented the best Democratic showing since the 1852 election. In the popular vote, Wilson won 41.8 percent, while Roosevelt won 27.4 percent, and Taft took 23.2 percent. Democrats won control of not just the presidency but also both houses of Congress, giving them unified control of the executive and legislative branches for the first time since the 1894 elections.  Historical reputation  Inevitably linked with Roosevelt, Taft generally falls in the shadow of the flamboyant Rough Rider, who chose him to be president, and who took it away. Political scientist Peri Arnold writes that most historians view Taft as a \\"conservative interregnum between activist reformers Roosevelt and Wilson,\\" adding that \\"there can be no doubt that Taft's hesitancy as a leader and politician produced few accomplishments during his term.\\" Scott Bomboy for the National Constitution Center wrote that despite being \\"one of the most interesting, intellectual, and versatile presidents ... a chief justice of the United States, a wrestler at Yale, a reformer, a peace activist, and a baseball fan ... today, Taft is best remembered as the president who was so large that he got stuck in the White House bathtub,\\" a story that is not true. Lurie argued that Taft did not receive the public credit for his policies that he should have, especially with regards to accelerating efforts to break up trusts. Taft, more quietly than his predecessor, filed many more cases than did Roosevelt, and rejected his predecessor's contention that there was such a thing as a \\"good\\" trust. This lack of flair marked Taft's presidency; according to Lurie, Taft \\"was boring—honest, likable, but boring\\". Mason called Taft's years in the White House \\"undistinguished\\". Coletta deemed Taft to have had a solid record of bills passed by Congress, but felt he could have accomplished more with political skill. U.S. Post Office issued a 4-cent postage stamp to commemorate William Howard Taft's life. Roosevelt engraved in public memory the image of Taft as a Buchanan-like figure, with a narrow view of the presidency which made him unwilling to act for the public good. Roosevelt was not alone in his negative assessment, as every major newspaper reporter of that time who left reminiscences of Taft's presidency was critical of him. Taft was convinced he would be vindicated by history. After he left office, he was estimated to be about in the middle of U.S. presidents by greatness, and subsequent rankings by historians have by and large sustained that verdict. In a 2017 C-SPAN survey 91 presidential historians ranked Taft 24th among the 43 former presidents, including then-president Barack Obama (unchanged from his ranking in 2009 and 2000). His rankings in the various categories of this most recent poll were as follows: public persuasion (31), crisis leadership (26), economic management (20), moral authority (25), international relations (21), administrative skills (12), relations with congress (23), vision/setting an agenda (28), pursued equal justice for all (22), performance with context of times (24). A 2018 poll of the American Political Science Association's Presidents and Executive Politics section ranked Taft as the 25th best president.

Harding began on March 4, 1921, when Warren G. Harding was inaugurated as President of the United States, and ended when he died on August 2, 1923, a span of days. Harding, the 29th United States president, presided over the country in the aftermath of World War I. A Republican from Ohio, Harding held office during a period in American political history from the mid-1890s to 1932 that was generally dominated by his party. He died of heart attack and was succeeded by Vice President Calvin Coolidge. Harding took office after defeating Democrat James M. Cox in the 1920 presidential election. Running against the policies of incumbent Democratic President Woodrow Wilson, Harding won the popular vote by a margin of 26.2 percentage points, which remains the largest popular-vote percentage margin in presidential elections since the end of the Era of Good Feelings in the 1820s. Upon taking office, Harding instituted conservative policies designed to minimize the government's role in the economy. Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon won passage of the Revenue Act of 1921, a major tax cut that primarily reduced taxes on the wealthy. Harding also signed the Budget and Accounting Act, which established the country's first formal budgeting process and created the Bureau of the Budget. Another major aspect of his domestic policy was the Fordney–McCumber Tariff, which greatly increased tariff rates. Harding supported the 1921 Emergency Quota Act, which marked the start of a period of restrictive immigration policies. He vetoed a bill designed to give a bonus to World War I veterans but presided over the creation of the Veterans Bureau. He also signed into law several bills designed to address the farm crisis and, along with Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, promoted new technologies like the radio and aviation. Harding's foreign policy was directed by Secretary of State Charles Evan Hughes. Hughes's major foreign policy achievement was the Washington Naval Conference of 1921–1922, in which the world's major naval powers agreed on a naval disarmament program. Harding appointed four Supreme Court justices, all of whom became conservative members of the Taft Court. Shortly after Harding's death, several major scandals emerged, including the Teapot Dome scandal. Harding died as one of the most popular presidents in history, but the subsequent exposure of the scandals eroded his popular regard, as did revelations of several extramarital affairs. In historical rankings of the U.S. presidents, Harding is often rated among the worst. 1920 election Republican nomination By early 1920, General Leonard Wood, Illinois governor Frank Lowden, and Senator Hiram Johnson of California had emerged as the frontrunners for the Republican nomination in the upcoming presidential election. Some in the party began to scout for such an alternative, and Harding's name arose, despite his reluctance, due to his unique ability to draw vital Ohio votes. Harry Daugherty, who became Harding's campaign manager, and who was sure none of these candidates could garner a majority, convinced Harding to run after a marathon discussion of six-plus hours. Daugherty's strategy focused on making Harding liked by or at least acceptable to all wings of the party, so that Harding could emerge as a compromise candidate in the likely event of a convention deadlock. He struck a deal with Oklahoma oilman Jake L. Hamon, whereby 18 Oklahoma delegates whose votes Hamon had bought for Lowden were committed to Harding as a second choice if Lowden's effort faltered. Republican National Convention, Chicago, Illinois, June 8–12, 1920 By the time the 1920 Republican National Convention began in June, a Senate sub-committee had tallied the monies spent by the various candidates, with totals as follows: Wood$1.8 million; Lowden$414,000; Johnson$194,000; and Harding$114,000; the committed delegate count at the opening gavel was: Wood124; Johnson112; Lowden72; Harding39. Still, at the opening, less than one-half of the delegates were committed, and many expected the convention to nominate a compromise candidate like Pennsylvania Senator Philander C. Knox, Massachusetts Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, or 1916 nominee Charles Evans Hughes. No candidate was able to corral a majority after nine ballots. After the convention adjourned for the day, Republican Senators and other leaders, who were divided and without a singular political boss, met in Room 404 of the Blackstone Hotel in Chicago. After a nightlong session, these party leaders tentatively concluded Harding was the best possible compromise candidate; this meeting has often been described as having taken place in a \\"smoke-filled room.\\" The next day, on the tenth ballot, Harding was nominated for president. Delegates then selected Massachusetts governor Calvin Coolidge to be his vice- presidential running mate. General election Harding's home in Marion, Ohio, from which he conducted his 1920 \\"front porch\\" campaign. (c.1918–1921) Harding's opponent in the 1920 election was Ohio governor and newspaperman James M. Cox, who had won the Democratic nomination in a 44-ballot convention battle. Harding rejected the Progressive ideology of the Wilson administration in favor of the laissez-faire approach of the McKinley administration. He ran on the promise of a \\"return to normalcy,\\" calling for the end to an era which he saw as tainted by war, internationalism, and government activism. He stated: The 1920 election was the first in which women could vote nationwide, as well as the first to be covered on the radio. Led by Albert Lasker, the Harding campaign executed a broad-based advertising campaign that used modern advertising techniques for the first time in a presidential campaign. Using newsreels, motion pictures, sound recordings, billboard posters, newspapers, magazines, and other media, Lasker emphasized and enhanced Harding's patriotism and affability. Five thousand speakers were trained by advertiser Harry New and sent across the country to speak for Harding. Telemarketers were used to make phone conferences with perfected dialogues to promote Harding, and Lasker had 8,000 photos of Harding and his wife distributed around the nation every two weeks. Farmers were sent brochures decrying the alleged abuses of Democratic agriculture policies, while African Americans and women were given literature in an attempt to take away votes from the Democrats. Additionally, celebrities like Al Jolson and Lillian Russell toured the nation on Harding's behalf. 1920 electoral vote results Harding won a decisive victory, receiving 404 electoral votes to Cox's 127. He took 60 percent of the nationwide popular vote, the highest percentage ever recorded up to that time, while Cox received just 34 percent of the vote. Campaigning from a federal prison, Socialist Party candidate Eugene V. Debs received 3% percent of the national vote. Harding won the popular vote by a margin of 26.2%, the largest margin since the election of 1820. He swept every state outside of the \\"Solid South\\", and his victory in Tennessee made him the first Republican to win a former Confederate state since the end of Reconstruction. In the concurrent congressional elections, the Republicans picked up 63 seats in the House of Representatives. The incoming 67th Congress would be dominated by Republicans, though the party was divided among various factions, including an independent- minded farm bloc from the Midwest. Inauguration Inauguration of Warren G. Harding, March 4, 1921. Harding was inaugurated as the nation's 29th president on March 4, 1921, on the East Portico of the United States Capitol. Chief Justice Edward D. White administered the oath of office. Harding placed his hand on the Washington Inaugural Bible as he recited the oath. This was the first time that a U.S. president rode to and from his inauguration in an automobile. In his inaugural address Harding reiterated the themes of his campaign, declaring: Literary critic H.L. Mencken was appalled, announcing that: Administration Cabinet Harding and his first Cabinet, 1921 From left: Harding, Andrew W. Mellon, Harry M. Daugherty, Edwin Denby, Henry C. Wallace, James J.

Henry Cabot Lodge, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, suggested that Harding appoint Elihu Root or Philander C. Knox as Secretary of State, but Harding instead selected former Supreme Court Justice Charles Evans Hughes for the position. Harding appointed Henry C. Wallace, an Iowan journalist who had advised Harding's 1920 campaign on farm issues, as Secretary of Agriculture. After Charles G. Dawes declined Harding's offer to become Secretary of the Treasury, Harding assented to Senator Boies Penrose's suggestion to select Pittsburgh billionaire Andrew Mellon. Harding used Mellon's appointment as leverage to win confirmation for Herbert Hoover, who had led the U.S. Food Administration under Wilson and who became Harding's Secretary of Commerce. Rejecting public calls to appoint Leonard Wood as Secretary of War, Harding instead appointed Lodge's preferred candidate, former Senator John W. Weeks of Massachusetts. He selected James J. Davis for the position of Secretary of Labor, as Davis satisfied Harding's criteria of being broadly acceptable to labor but being opposed to labor leader Samuel Gompers. Will H. Hays, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, was appointed Postmaster General. Grateful for his actions at the 1920 Republican convention, Harding offered Frank Lowden the post of Secretary of the Navy. After Lowden turned down the post, Harding instead appointed former Congressman Edwin Denby of Michigan. New Mexico Senator Albert B. Fall, a close ally of Harding's during their time in the Senate together, became Harding's Secretary of the Interior. Although Harding was committed to putting the \\"best minds\\" on his Cabinet, he often awarded other appointments to those who had contributed to his campaign's victory. Wayne Wheeler, leader of the Anti-Saloon League, was allowed by Harding to dictate who would serve on the Prohibition Commission. Harding appointed Harry M. Daugherty as Attorney General because he felt he owed Daugherty for running his 1920 campaign. After the election, many people from the Ohio area moved to Washington, D.C., made their headquarters in a little green house on K Street, and would be eventually known as the \\"Ohio Gang\\".Harry M. Daugherty, Ohio History Central, Retrieved September 5, 2010 Graft and corruption charges permeated Harding's Department of Justice; bootleggers confiscated tens of thousands cases of whiskey through bribery and kickbacks. The financial and political scandals caused by the Ohio Gang and other Harding appointees, in addition to Harding's own personal controversies, severely damaged Harding's personal reputation and eclipsed his presidential accomplishments. Press corps According to biographers, Harding got along better with the press than any other previous president, being a former newspaperman. Reporters admired his frankness, candor, and his confessed limitations. He took the press behind the scenes and showed them the inner circle of the presidency. In November 1921, Harding also implemented a policy of taking written questions from reporters during a press conference. Judicial appointments Harding appointed four justices to the Supreme Court of the United States. After the death of Chief Justice Edward Douglass White, former President William Howard Taft lobbied Harding for the nomination to succeed White. Harding acceded to Taft's request, and Taft joined the court in June 1921. Harding's next choice for the Court was conservative former Senator George Sutherland of Utah, who had been a major supporter of Taft in 1912 and Harding in 1920. Sutherland succeeded John Hessin Clarke in September 1922 after Clarke resigned. Two Supreme Court vacancies arose in 1923 due to the death of William R. Day and the resignation of Mahlon Pitney. On Taft's recommendation, Harding nominated railroad attorney and conservative Democrat Pierce Butler to succeed Day. Progressive senators like Robert M. La Follette unsuccessfully sought to defeat Butler's nomination, but Butler was confirmed. On the advice of Attorney General Daugherty, Harding appointed federal appellate judge Edward Terry Sanford of Tennessee to succeed Pitney. Bolstered by these appointments, the Taft Court upheld the precedents of the Lochner era and largely reflected the conservatism of the 1920s. Harding also appointed 6 judges to the United States Courts of Appeals, 42 judges to the United States district courts, and 2 judges to the United States Court of Customs Appeals. Domestic affairs Revenue Act of 1921 Secretary of Treasury Andrew W. Mellon Harding assumed office while the nation was in the midst of a postwar economic decline known as the Depression of 1920–21. He strongly rejected proposals to provide for federal unemployment benefits, believing that the government should leave relief efforts to charities and local governments. He believed that the best way to restore economic prosperity was to raise tariff rates and reduce the government's role in economic activities. His administration's economic policy was formulated by Secretary of the Treasury Mellon, who proposed cuts to the excess profits tax and the corporate tax. The central tenet of Mellon's tax plan was a reduction of the surtax, a progressive income tax that only affected high-income earners. Mellon favored the wealthy holding as much capital as possible, since he saw them as the main drivers of economic growth. Congressional Republican leaders shared Harding and Mellon's desire for tax cuts, and Republicans made tax cuts and tariff rates the key legislative priorities of Harding's first year in office. Harding called a special session of the Congress to address these and other issues, and Congress convened in April 1921. Despite opposition from Democrats and many farm state Republicans, Congress passed the Revenue Act of 1921 in November, and Harding signed the bill into law later that month. The act greatly reduced taxes for the wealthiest Americans, though the cuts were not as deep as Mellon had favored. The act reduced the top marginal income tax rate from 73 percent to 58 percent, lowered the corporate tax from 65 percent to 50 percent, and provided for ultimate elimination of the excess profits tax. Revenues to the treasury decreased substantially. Wages, profits, and productivity all made substantial gains during the 1920s, and economists have differed as to whether Revenue Act of 1921 played a major role in the strong period of economic growth after the Depression of 1920–21. Economist Daniel Kuehn has attributed the improvement to the earlier monetary policy of the Federal Reserve, and notes that the changes in marginal tax rates were accompanied by an expansion in the tax base that could account for the increase in revenue. Libertarian historians Schweikart and Allen argue that Harding's tax and economic policies in part \\"... produced the most vibrant eight year burst of manufacturing and innovation in the nation's history,\\" Recovery did not last long. Another economic contraction began near the end of Harding's presidency in 1923, while tax cuts were still underway. A third contraction followed in 1927 during the next presidential term. Some economists have argued that the tax cuts resulted in growing economic inequality and speculation, which in turn contributed to the Great Depression. Fordney–McCumber Tariff Like most Republicans of his era, Harding favored protective tariffs designed to shield American businesses from foreign competition. Shortly after taking office, he signed the Emergency Tariff of 1921, a stopgap measure primarily designed to aid American farmers suffering from the effects of an expansion in European farm imports. The emergency tariff also protected domestic manufacturing, as it included a clause to prevent dumping by European manufacturers. Harding hoped to sign a permanent tariff into law by the end of 1921, but heated congressional debate over tariff schedules, especially between agricultural and manufacturing interests, delayed passage of such a bill. In September 1922, Harding enthusiastically signed the Fordney–McCumber Tariff Act. The protectionist legislation was sponsored by Representative Joseph W. Fordney and Senator Porter J. McCumber, and was supported by nearly every congressional Republican. The act increased the tariff rates contained in the previous Underwood-Simmons Tariff Act of 1913, to the highest level in the nation's history. Harding became concerned when the agriculture business suffered economic hardship from the high tariffs. By 1922, Harding began to believe that the long-term effects of high tariffs could be detrimental to national economy, despite the short-term benefits. The high tariffs established under Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover have historically been viewed as a contributing factor to the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Bureau of the Budget Charles Dawes—the first budget director Harding believed the federal government should be fiscally managed in a way similar to private sector businesses. He had campaigned on the slogan, \\"Less government in business and more business in government.\\" As the House Ways and Means Committee found it increasingly difficult to balance revenues and expenditures, Taft had recommended the creation of a federal budget system during his presidency. Businessmen and economists coalesced around Taft's proposal during the Wilson administration, and by 1920, both parties favored it. Reflecting this goal, in June 1921, Harding signed the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921. The act established the Bureau of the Budget to coordinate the federal budgeting process. At the head of this office was the presidential budget director, who was directly responsible to the president rather than to the Secretary of Treasury. The law also stipulated that the president must annually submit a budget to Congress, and all presidents since have had to do so.History Channel (2005), The Presidents, Part 6, Section 2/5. Additionally, the General Accounting Office (GAO) was created to assure congressional oversight of federal budget expenditures. The GAO would be led by the Comptroller General, who was appointed by Congress to a term of fifteen years. Harding appointed Charles Dawes as the Bureau of the Budget's first director. Dawes's first year in office saw government spending reduced by $1.5 billion, a 25 percent reduction, and he presided over another 25 percent reduction the following year. Immigration restriction In the first two decades of the 20th century, immigration to the United States had increased, with many of the immigrants coming from Southern Europe and Eastern Europe rather than Western Europe. Many Americans viewed these new immigrants with suspicion, and World War I and the First Red Scare further heightened nativist fears. The Per Centum Act of 1921, signed by Harding on May 19, 1921, reduced the numbers of immigrants to 3 percent of a country's represented population based on the 1910 Census. The act, which had been vetoed by President Wilson in the previous Congress, also allowed unauthorized immigrants to be deported. Harding and Secretary of Labor James Davis believed that enforcement had to be humane, and Harding often allowed exceptions granting reprieves to thousands of immigrants. Immigration to the United States fell from roughly 800,000 in 1920 to approximately 300,000 in 1922. Though the act was later superseded by the Immigration Act of 1924, it marked the establishment of the National Origins Formula. Veterans Many World War I veterans were unemployed or otherwise economically distressed when Harding took office. To aid these veterans, the Senate considered passing a law that gave veterans a $1 bonus for each day they had served in the war. Harding opposed payment of a bonus to veterans, arguing that much was already being done for them and that the bill would \\"break down our Treasury, from which so much is later on to be expected.\\" The Senate sent the bonus bill back to committee, but the issue returned when Congress reconvened in December 1921. A bill providing a bonus, without a means of funding it, was passed by both houses in September 1922. Harding vetoed it, and the veto was narrowly sustained. In August 1921, Harding signed the Sweet Bill, which established a new agency known as the Veterans Bureau. After World War I, 300,000 wounded veterans were in need of hospitalization, medical care, and job training. To handle the needs of these veterans, the new agency incorporated the War Risk Insurance Bureau, the Federal Hospitalization Bureau, and three other bureaus that dealt with veteran affairs. Harding appointed Colonel Charles R. Forbes, a decorated war veteran, as the Veteran Bureau's first director. The Veterans Bureau later was incorporated into the Veterans Administration and ultimately the Department of Veterans Affairs. Farm acts Farmers were among the hardest hit during the Depression of 1920–21, and prices for farm goods collapsed. The presence of a powerful bipartisan farm bloc led by Senator William S. Kenyon and Congressman Lester J. Dickinson ensured that Congress would address the farm crisis. Harding established the Joint Commission on Agricultural Industry to make recommendations on farm policy, and he signed a series of farm- and food- related laws in 1921 and 1922. Much of the legislation emanated from President Woodrow Wilson's 1919 Federal Trade Commission report, which investigated and discovered \\"manipulations, controls, trusts, combinations, or restraints out of harmony with the law or the public interest\\" in the meat packing industry. The first law was the Packers and Stockyards Act, which prohibited packers from engaging in unfair and deceptive practices. Two amendments were made to the Farm Loan Act of 1916 that President Wilson had signed into law, which had expanded the maximum size of rural farm loans. The Emergency Agriculture Credit Act authorized new loans to farmers to help them sell and market livestock. The Capper–Volstead Act, signed by Harding on February 18, 1922, protected farm cooperatives from anti-trust legislation. The Future Trading Act was also enacted, regulating puts and calls, bids, and offers on futures contracting. Later, on May 15, 1922, the Supreme Court ruled this legislation unconstitutional, but Congress passed the similar Grain Futures Act in response. Though sympathetic to farmers and deferential to Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace, Harding was uncomfortable with many of the farm programs since they relied on governmental action, and he sought to weaken the farm bloc by appointing Kenyon to a federal judgeship in 1922. Highways and radio Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover listening to a radio During the 1920s, use of electricity became increasingly common, and mass production of the automobile stimulated industries such as highway construction, rubber, steel, and construction. Congress had passed the Federal Aid Road Act of 1916 to aid state road-building programs, and Harding favored a further expansion of the federal role in road construction and maintenance. He signed into law the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921, which allowed states to select interstate and intercounty roads that would receive federal funds. From 1921 to 1923, the federal government spent $162 million on America's highway system, infusing the U.S. economy with a large amount of capital. Harding and Secretary of Commerce Hoover embraced the emerging medium of the radio. In June 1922, Harding became the first president that the American public heard on the radio, delivering a speech in honor of Francis Scott Key. Secretary of Commerce Hoover took charge of the administration's radio policy. He convened a conference of radio broadcasters in 1922, which led to a voluntary agreement for licensing of radio frequencies through the Commerce Department. Both Harding and Hoover believed that something more than an agreement was needed, but Congress was slow to act, not imposing radio regulation until 1927. Hoover hosted a similar conference on aviation, but, as with the radio, was unable to win passage of legislation that would have provided for regulation air travel. Labor issues Union membership had grown during World War I, and by 1920 union members constituted approximately one-fifth of the labor force. Many employers reduced wages after the war, and some business leaders hoped to destroy the power of organized labor in order to re-establish control over their employees. These policies led to increasing labor tension in the early 1920s. Widespread strikes marked 1922, as labor sought redress for falling wages and increased unemployment. In April, 500,000 coal miners, led by John L. Lewis, struck over wage cuts. Mining executives argued that the industry was seeing hard times; Lewis accused them of trying to break the union. Harding convinced the miners to return to work while a congressional commission looked into their grievances. He also sent out the National Guard and 2,200 deputy U.S. marshals to keep the peace. On July 1, 1922, 400,000 railroad workers went on strike. Harding proposed a settlement that made some concessions, but management objected. Attorney General Daugherty convinced Judge James H. Wilkerson to issue a sweeping injunction to break up the strike. Although there was public support for the Wilkerson injunction, Harding felt it went too far, and had Daugherty and Wilkerson amend it. The injunction succeeded in ending the strike; however, tensions remained high between railroad workers and management for years. By 1922, the eight-hour day had become common in American industry. One exception was in steel mills, where workers labored through a twelve-hour workday, seven days a week. Hoover considered this practice barbaric, and convinced Harding to convene a conference of steel manufacturers with a view to ending it. The conference established a committee under the leadership of U.S. Steel chairman Elbert Gary, which in early 1923 recommended against ending the practice. Harding sent a letter to Gary deploring the result, which was printed in the press, and public outcry caused the manufacturers to reverse themselves and standardize the eight-hour day. African Americans Leonidas C. Dyer Harding spoke of equal rights in his speech when accepting the Republican nomination in 1920: \\"No majority shall abridge the rights of a minority....I believe the Black citizens of America should be guaranteed the enjoyment of all their rights, that they have earned their full measure of citizenship bestowed, that their sacrifices in blood on the battlefields of the republic have entitled them to all of freedom and opportunity, all of sympathy and aid that the American spirit of fairness and justice demands.”James D. Robenalt, “The Republican president who called for racial justice in America after Tulsa massacre: Warren G. Harding’s comments about race and equality were remarkable for 1921” Washington Post June 21, 2020 In June 1921, three days after the massive Tulsa race massacre President Harding spoke at the all-black Lincoln University in Pennsylvania. “Despite the demagogues, the idea of our oneness as Americans has risen superior to every appeal to mere class and group,” Harding declared. “And so, I wish it might be in this matter of our national problem of races.” He honored Lincoln alumni who had been among the more than 367,000 black soldiers to fight in the Great War. One Lincoln graduate led the 370th U.S. Infantry, the “Black Devils.” Col. F.A. Denison was the sole black commander of a regiment in France. The President called education critical to solving the issues of racial inequality, but he challenged the students to shoulder their shared responsibility to advance freedom. The government alone, he said, could not magically “take a race from bondage to citizenship in half a century.” He spoke about Tulsa and offered up a simple prayer: “God grant that, in the soberness, the fairness, and the justice of this country, we never see another spectacle like it.”Robenalt, “The Republican president who called for racial justice in America after Tulsa massacre\\" Notably in an age of severe racial intolerance during the 1920s, Harding did not hold any racial animosity, according to historian Carl S. Anthony.Anthony (July–August, 1998), The Most Scandalous President In a speech on October 26, 1921, given in segregated Birmingham, Alabama Harding advocated civil rights for African Americans, becoming the first president to openly advocate black political, educational, and economic equality during the 20th century. In the Birmingham speech, Harding called for African Americans to have equal educational opportunities and greater voting rights in the South. The white section of the audience listened in silence while the black section of the segregated audience cheered. Harding, however, openly stated that he was not for black social equality in terms of racial mixing or intermarriage.Christian Science Monitor (October 27, 1921), The President's Views On Race Harding also spoke on the Great Migration, stating that blacks migrating to the North and West to find employment had actually harmed race relations between blacks and whites. The three previous presidents had dropped African Americans from several government positions they had previously held, and Harding reversed this policy. African Americans were appointed to high-level positions in the Departments of Labor and Interior, and numerous blacks were hired in other agencies and departments. Trani and Wilson write that Harding did not emphasize appointing African Americans to positions they had traditionally held prior to Wilson's tenure, partly out of a desire to court white Southerners. Harding also disappointed black supporters by not abolishing segregation in federal offices, and through his failure to comment publicly on the Ku Klux Klan. Harding supported Congressman Leonidas Dyer's federal anti- lynching bill, known as the Dyer Bill, which passed the House of Representatives in January, 1922. When it reached the Senate floor in November 1922, it was filibustered by Southern Democrats, and Senator Lodge withdrew it so as to allow a ship subsidy bill Harding favored to be debated. Many blacks blamed Harding for the Dyer bill's defeat; Harding biographer Robert K. Murray noted that it was hastened to its end by Harding's desire to have the ship subsidy bill considered. Sheppard–Towner Maternity Act On November 21, 1921, Harding signed the Sheppard–Towner Maternity Act, the first major federal government social welfare program in the U.S. The law was sponsored by Julia Lathrop, America's first director of the U.S. Children's Bureau. The Sheppard–Towner Maternity Act funded almost 3,000 child and health centers, where doctors treated healthy pregnant women and provided preventive care to healthy children. Child welfare workers were sent out to make sure that parents were taking care of their children. Many women were given career opportunities as welfare and social workers. Although the law remained in effect only eight years, it set the trend for New Deal social programs during the 1930s. Deregulation As part of Harding's belief in limiting the government's role in the economy, he sought to undercut the power of the regulatory agencies that had been created or strengthened during the Progressive Era. Among the agencies in existence when Harding came to office were the Federal Reserve (charged with regulating banks), the Interstate Commerce Commission (charged with regulating railroads) and the Federal Trade Commission (charged with regulating other business activities, especially trusts). Harding staffed the agencies with individuals sympathetic to business concerns and hostile to regulation. By the end of his tenure, only the Federal Trade Commission resisted conservative domination. Other federal organizations, like the Railroad Labor Board, also came under the sway of business interests. In 1921, Harding signed the Willis Graham Act, which effectively rescinded the Kingsbury Commitment and allowed AT&T; to establish a monopoly in the telephone industry. Release of political prisoners Eugene Debs after release from prison by President Harding, visits the White House On December 23, 1921 Harding released Socialist leader Eugene Debs from prison. Debs had been convicted under sedition charges brought by the Wilson administration for his opposition to the draft during World War I. Despite many political differences between the two candidates, Harding commuted Debs' sentence to time served, though he did not grant Debs an official presidential pardon. Debs' failing health was a contributing factor for the release. Harding granted a general amnesty to 23 prisoners, alleged anarchists and socialists, who had been active during the First Red Scare. 1922 mid-term elections Entering the 1922 midterm congressional election campaign, Harding and the Republicans had followed through on many of their campaign promises. But some of the fulfilled pledges, like cutting taxes for the well- off, did not appeal to the electorate. The economy had not returned to normalcy, with unemployment at 11 percent, and organized labor was angry over the outcome of the strikes. In the 1922 elections, Republicans suffered major losses in both the House and the Senate. Though they kept control of both chambers, they retained only a narrow majority in the House at the start of the 68th Congress in 1923. The elections empowered the progressive wing of the party led by Robert La Follette, who began investigations into Harding administration. Foreign affairs European relations By the time Harding took office, several new European states had been established in the Aftermath of World War I Harding took office less than two years after the end of World War I, and his administration faced several issues in the aftermath of that conflict. Harding made it clear when he appointed Hughes as Secretary of State that the former justice would run foreign policy, a change from Wilson's close management of international affairs. Harding and Hughes frequently communicated, and the president remained well-informed regarding the state of foreign affairs, but he rarely overrode any of Hughes's decisions. Hughes did have to work within some broad outlines; after taking office, Harding hardened his stance on the League of Nations, deciding the U.S. would not join even a scaled-down version of the League. With the Treaty of Versailles unratified by the Senate, the U.S. remained technically at war with Germany, Austria, and Hungary. Peacemaking began with the Knox–Porter Resolution, declaring the U.S. at peace and reserving any rights granted under Versailles. Treaties with Germany, Austria and Hungary, each containing many of the non-League provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, were ratified in 1921. This still left the question of relations between the U.S. and the League. Hughes' State Department initially ignored communications from the League, or tried to bypass it through direct communications with member nations. By 1922, though, the U.S., through its consul in Geneva, was dealing with the League. The U.S. refused to participate in any League meeting with political implications, but it sent observers to sessions on technical and humanitarian matters. Harding stunned the capital when he sent to the Senate a message supporting the participation of the U.S. in the proposed Permanent Court of International Justice (also known as the \\"World Court\\"). His proposal was not favorably received by most senators, and a resolution supporting U.S. membership in the World Court was drafted and promptly buried in the Foreign Affairs Committee. By the time Harding took office, there were calls from foreign governments for the reduction of the massive war debt owed to the United States, and the German government sought to reduce the reparations that it was required to pay. The U.S. refused to consider any multilateral settlement. Harding sought passage of a plan proposed by Mellon to give the administration broad authority to reduce war debts in negotiation, but Congress, in 1922, passed a more restrictive bill. Hughes negotiated an agreement for Britain to pay off its war debt over 62 years at low interest, effectively reducing the present value of the obligations. This agreement, approved by Congress in 1923, set a pattern for negotiations with other nations. Talks with Germany on reduction of reparations payments would result in the Dawes Plan of 1924. During World War I, the U.S. had been among the nations that had sent troops to Russia after the Russian Revolution. Afterwards, President Wilson refused to provide diplomatic recognition to Russia, which was led by a Communist government following the October Revolution. Commerce Secretary Hoover, with considerable experience of Russian affairs, took the lead on Russian policy. He supported aid to and trade with Russia, fearing U.S. companies would be frozen out of the Soviet market. When famine struck Russia in 1921, Hoover had the American Relief Administration, which he had headed, negotiate with the Russians to provide aid. According to historian George Herring, the American relief effort may have saved as many as 10 million people from starvation. U.S. businessman such as Armand Hammer invested in the Russian economy, but many of these investments failed due to various Russian restrictions on trade and commerce. Russian and (after the 1922 establishment of the Soviet Union) Soviet leaders hoped that these economic and humanitarian connections would lead to recognition of their government, but Communism's extreme unpopularity in the U.S. precluded this possibility. Disarmament Charles Evans Hughes, former Supreme Court Justice and Harding's Secretary of State At the end of World War I, the United States had the largest navy and one of the largest armies in the world. With no serious threat to the United States itself, Harding and his successors presided over the disarmament of the navy and the army. The army shrank to 140,000 men, while naval reduction was based on a policy of parity with Britain. Seeking to prevent an arms race, Senator William Borah won passage of a congressional resolution calling for a 50 percent reduction of the American Navy, the British Navy, and the Japanese Navy. With Congress's backing, Harding and Hughes began preparations to hold a naval disarmament conference in Washington. The Washington Naval Conference convened in November 1921, with representatives from the U.S., Japan, Britain, France, Italy, China, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Portugal. Secretary of State Hughes assumed a primary role in the conference and made the pivotal proposal—the U.S. would reduce its number of warships by 30 if Great Britain decommissioned 19 ships and Japan decommissioned 17 ships. A journalist covering the conference wrote that \\"Hughes sank in thirty-five minutes more ships than all of the admirals of the world have sunk in a cycle of centuries. The conference produced six treaties and twelve resolutions among the participating nations, which ranged from limiting the tonnage of naval ships to custom tariffs. The United States, Britain, Japan, and France reached the Four-Power Treaty, in which each country agreed to respect the territorial integrity of one another in the Pacific Ocean. Those four powers as well as Italy also reached the Washington Naval Treaty, which established a ratio of battleship tonnage that each country agreed to respect. In the Nine-Power Treaty, each signatory agreed to respect the Open Door Policy in China, and Japan agreed to return Shandong to China. The treaties only remained in effect until the mid-1930s, however, and ultimately failed. Japan eventually invaded Manchuria and the arms limitations no longer had any effect. The building of \\"monster warships\\" resumed and the U.S. and Great Britain were unable to quickly rearm themselves to defend an international order and stop Japan from remilitarizing.Goldstein, Erik The Washington Conference 1921–22, 1994, Retrieved May 14, 2010.Goldman, Emily O. Sunken treaties, 1994; retrieved May 14, 2010 Latin America Intervention in Latin America had been a minor campaign issue; Harding spoke against Wilson's decision to send U.S. troops to the Dominican Republic, and attacked the Democratic vice presidential candidate, Franklin D. Roosevelt, for his role in the Haitian intervention. Secretary of State Hughes worked to improve relations with Latin American countries who were wary of the American use of the Monroe Doctrine to justify intervention; at the time of Harding's inauguration, the U.S. also had troops in Cuba and Nicaragua. The troops stationed in Cuba to protect American interests were withdrawn in 1921, but U.S. forces remained in the other three nations through Harding's presidency. In April 1921, Harding gained the ratification of the Thomson–Urrutia Treaty with Colombia, granting that nation $25,000,000 as settlement for the U.S.-provoked Panamanian revolution of 1903. The Latin American nations were not fully satisfied, as the U.S. refused to renounce interventionism, though Hughes pledged to limit it to nations near the Panama Canal and to make it clear what the U.S. aims were. The U.S. had intervened repeatedly in Mexico under Wilson, and had withdrawn diplomatic recognition, setting conditions for reinstatement. The Mexican government under President Álvaro Obregón wanted recognition before negotiations, but Wilson and his final Secretary of State, Bainbridge Colby, refused. Both Hughes and Secretary of the Interior Fall opposed recognition; Hughes instead sent a draft treaty to the Mexicans in May 1921, which included pledges to reimburse Americans for losses in Mexico since the 1910 revolution there. Obregón was unwilling to sign a treaty before being recognized, and he worked to improve the relationship between American businesses and Mexico, reaching agreement with creditors and mounting a public relations campaign in the United States. This had its effect, and by mid-1922, Fall was less influential than he had been, lessening the resistance to recognition. The two presidents appointed commissioners to reach a deal, and the U.S. recognized the Obregón government on August 31, 1923, just under a month after Harding's death, substantially on the terms proffered by Mexico. Administration scandals When Harding assembled his administration following the 1920 election, he appointed several longtime allies and campaign contributors to prominent political positions in control of vast amounts of government money and resources. Some of the appointees used their new powers to exploit their positions for personal gain. Although Harding was responsible for making these appointments, it is unclear how much, if anything, Harding himself knew about his friends' illicit activities. No evidence to date suggests that Harding personally profited from such crimes, but he was apparently unable to prevent them. \\"I have no trouble with my enemies\\", Harding told journalist William Allen White late in his presidency, \\"but my damn friends, they're the ones that keep me walking the floor nights!\\" The only scandal which was openly discovered during Harding's lifetime was in the Veteran's Bureau. Yet gossip about various scandals became rampant after the suicides of Charles Cramer and Jess Smith. Harding responded aggressively to all of this with a mixture of grief, anger and perplexity. Teapot Dome Albert B. Fall, Harding's first Secretary of the Interior and the first former Cabinet member sent to prison The most notorious scandal was Teapot Dome, most of which came to light after Harding's death. This affair concerned an oil reserve in Wyoming that was covered by a teapot-shaped rock formation. For years, the country had taken measures to ensure the availability of petroleum reserves, particularly for the navy's use. On February 23, 1923, Harding issued Executive Order # 3797, which created the Naval Petroleum Reserve Number 4 in Alaska. By the 1920s, it was clear that petroleum was important to the national economy and security, and the reserve system was designed to keep the oil under government jurisdiction rather than subject to private claims. Management of these reserves was the subject of multi-dimensional arguments—beginning with a turf battle between the Secretary of the Navy and the Interior Department. The strategic reserves issue was also a debate topic between conservationists and the petroleum industry, as well as those who favored public ownership versus private control. Secretary of the Interior Albert Fall brought to his office significant political and legal experience, in addition to heavy personal debt, incurred in his obsession to expand his personal estate in New Mexico. He also was an avid supporter of the private ownership and management of reserves. Fall contracted Edward Doheny of Pan American Corporation to build storage tanks in exchange for drilling rights. It later came to light that Doheny had made significant personal loans to Fall. The secretary also negotiated leases for the Teapot Dome reserves to Harry Ford Sinclair of the Consolidated Oil Corporation in return for guaranteed oil reserves to the credit of the government. Again, it later emerged that Sinclair had personally made concurrent cash payments of over $400,000 to Fall. These activities took place under the watch of progressive and conservationist attorney, Harry A. Slattery, acting for Gifford Pinchot and Robert La Follette. Fall was ultimately convicted in 1931 of accepting bribes and illegal no-interest personal loans in exchange for the leasing of public oil fields to business associates. In 1931, Fall was the first cabinet member in history imprisoned for crimes committed while in office. Paradoxically, while Fall was convicted for taking the bribe, Doheny was acquitted of paying it. Justice Department Harry M. Daugherty, U.S. Attorney General. Photo taken 1920. Harding's appointment of Harry M. Daugherty as Attorney General received more criticism than any other. As Harding's campaign manager, Daugherty's Ohio lobbying and back room maneuvers with politicians were not considered the best qualifications. Historian M. R. Werner referred to the Justice Department under Harding and Daugherty as \\"the den of a ward politician and the White House a night club\\". On September 16, 1922, Minnesota Congressman Oscar E. Keller brought impeachment charges against Daugherty. On December 4, formal investigation hearings, headed by congressman Andrew J. Volstead, began against Daugherty. The impeachment process, however, stopped, since Keller's charges that Daugherty protected interests in trust and war fraud cases could not be substantially proven. Daugherty, according to a 1924 Senate investigation into the Justice Department, authorized a system of graft between aides Jess Smith and Howard Mannington. Both Mannington and Smith allegedly took bribes to secure appointments, prison pardons, and freedom from prosecution. A majority of these purchasable pardons were directed towards bootleggers. Cincinnati bootlegger George L. Remus, allegedly paid Jess Smith $250,000 to not prosecute him. Remus, however, was prosecuted, convicted, and sentenced to Atlanta prison. Smith tried to extract more bribe money from Remus to pay for a pardon. The prevalent question at the Justice Department was \\"How is he fixed?\\" Another alleged scandal involving Daugherty concerned the Wright- Martin Aircraft Corp., which supposedly overcharged the federal government by $2.3 million on war contracts. Captain Hazel Scaife tried to bring the company to trial, but was blocked by the Department of Justice. At this time, Daugherty was said to have owned stock in the company and was even adding to these holdings, though he was never charged in the matter. Daugherty hired William J. Burns to run the Justice Department's Bureau of Investigation. A number of inquisitive congressmen or senators found themselves the object of wire taps, rifled files, and copied correspondence. Burns' primary operative was Gaston B. Means, a reputed con man, who was known to have fixed prosecutions, sold favors, and manipulated files in the Justice Department. Means, who acted independently, took direct instructions and payments from Jess Smith, without Burn's knowledge, to spy on congressmen. Means hired a woman, Laura Jacobson, to spy on Senator Thaddeus Caraway, a critic of the Harding administration. Means also was involved with \\"roping\\" bootleggers. Daugherty remained in his position during the early days of the Calvin Coolidge administration, then resigned on March 28, 1924, amidst allegations that he accepted bribes from bootleggers. Daugherty was later tried and acquitted twice for corruption. Both juries hung—in one case, after 65 hours of deliberation. Daugherty's famous defense attorney, Max Steuer, blamed all corruption allegations against Daugherty on Jess Smith, who by then had committed suicide. Jess W. Smith Jess Smith Daugherty's personal aide, Jess W. Smith, was a central figure in government file manipulation, paroles and pardons, influence peddling—and even served as bag man. During Prohibition, pharmacies received alcohol permits to sell alcohol for medical purposes. According to Congressional testimony, Daugherty arranged for Jess Smith and Howard Mannington to sell these permits to drug company agents who really represented bootleggers. The bootleggers, having obtained a permit could buy cases of whiskey. Smith and Mannington split the permit sales profits. Approximately 50,000 to 60,000 cases of whiskey were sold to bootleggers at a net worth of $750,000 to $900,000. Smith supplied bootleg whiskey to the White House and the Ohio Gang house on K Street, concealing the whiskey in a briefcase for poker games. Eventually, rumors of Smith's abuses—free use of government cars, going to all night parties, manipulation of Justice Department files—reached Harding. Harding withdrew Smith's White House clearance and Daugherty told him to leave Washington. On May 30, 1923, Smith's dead body was found at Daugherty's apartment with a gunshot wound to the head. William J. Burns immediately took Smith's body away and there was no autopsy. Historian Francis Russell, concluding this was a suicide, indicates that a Daugherty aide entered Smith's room moments after a noise awoke him, and found Smith on the floor with his head in a trash can and a revolver in his hand. Smith allegedly purchased the gun from a hardware store shortly before his death, after Daugherty verbally abused him for waking him up from a nap. Veterans' bureau Charles R. Forbes, director of the Veterans Bureau and convicted of defrauding the government Charles R. Forbes, the energetic Director of the Veterans Bureau, disregarded the dire needs of wounded World War I veterans to procure his own wealth. After his appointment, Forbes convinced Harding to issue executive orders that gave him control over veterans' hospital construction and supplies. To limit corruption in the Veterans' Bureau, Harding insisted that all government contracts be by public notice, but Forbes provided inside information to his co-conspirators to ensure their bids succeeded. Forbes' main task at the Veterans bureau, having an unprecedented $500 million yearly budget, was to ensure that new hospitals were built around the country to help the 300,000 wounded World War I veterans. Forbes defrauded the government of an estimated $225 million by increasing construction costs from $3,000 to $4,000 per hospital bed. In early 1922, Forbes went on tours, known as joy-rides, of new hospital construction sites around the country and the Pacific Coast. On these tours, Forbes allegedly received traveling perks and alcohol kickbacks, took a $5,000 bribe in Chicago, and made a secret code to ensure $17 million in government construction hospital contracts with corrupt contractors. Intent on making more money, on his return to the U.S. Capitol Forbes immediately began selling valuable hospital supplies under his control in large warehouses at the Perryville Depot. The government had stockpiled huge amounts of hospital supplies during the first World War, which Forbes unloaded for a fraction of their cost to the Boston firm of Thompson and Kelly. Charles F. Cramer, Forbes' legal council to the Veterans Bureau, rocked the nation's capital when he committed suicide in 1923.The Hartford Courant (March 15, 1923), Charles F. Cramer Ex-Veterans' Bureau Counsel A Suicide, p. 14 Cramer, at the time of his death, was being investigated by a Senate committee on charges of corruption.The Hartford Courant (March 15, 1923), Charles F. Cramer Ex- Veterans' Bureau Counsel A Suicide, p. I4The Helena Daily Independent (March 19, 1923), Veterans' Bureau Probe, p. 4 Forbes faced resistance in the form of General Charles E. Sawyer, chairman of the Federal Hospitalization Board, who represented controlling interests in the valuable hospital supplies. Sawyer, who was also Harding's personal physician, told Harding that Forbes was selling valuable hospital supplies to an insider contractor. After issuing two orders for the sales to stop, Harding finally summoned Forbes to the White House and demanded Forbes' resignation, since Forbes had been insubordinate in not stopping the shipments.Los Angeles Times (November 8, 1923), Says Forbes Forced Out, page I1. Harding, however, was not yet ready to announce Forbes' resignation and let him flee to Europe on the \\"flimsy pretext\\" that he would help disabled U.S. Veterans in Europe. Harding placed a reformer, Brigadier General Frank T. Hines, in charge of the Veterans Bureau. Hines immediately cleared up the mess left by Forbes. When Forbes returned to the U.S., he visited Harding at the White House in the Red Room. During the meeting, Harding angrily grabbed Forbes by the throat, shook him vigorously, and exclaimed \\"You double-crossing bastard!\\" In 1926, Forbes was brought to trial and convicted of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government. He received a two- year prison sentence and was released in November 1927. Other agencies Harding as he appears at the National Postal Museum in Washington, D.C. On June 13, 1921, Harding appointed Albert D. Lasker chairman of the United States Shipping Board. Lasker, a cash donor and Harding's general campaign manager, had no previous experience with shipping companies. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 had allowed the Shipping Board to sell ships made by the U.S. Government to private American companies. A congressional investigation revealed that while Lasker was in charge, many valuable steel cargo ships, worth between $200 and $250 a ton, were sold for as low as $30 a ton to private American shipping companies without an appraisal board. J. Harry Philbin, a manager in the sales division, testified at the congressional hearing that under Lasker's authority U.S. ships were sold, \\"...as is, where is, take your pick, no matter which vessel you took.\\" Lasker resigned from the Shipping Board on July 1, 1923. Thomas W. Miller, head of the Office of Alien Property, was convicted of accepting bribes. Miller's citizenship rights were taken away and he was sentenced to 18 months in prison and a $5,000 fine. After Miller served 13 months of his sentence, he was released on parole. President Herbert Hoover restored Miller's citizenship on February 2, 1933. Roy Asa Haynes, Harding's Prohibition Commissioner, ran the patronage-riddled Prohibition bureau, which was allegedly corrupt from top to bottom. The bureau's \\"B permits\\" for liquor sales became tantamount to negotiable securities, as a result of being so widely bought and sold among known violators of the law. The bureau's agents allegedly made a year's salary from one month's illicit sales of permits. Life at the White House Laddie Boy. Photo: 1922 Harding's lifestyle at the White House was fairly unconventional compared to his predecessor. Upstairs at the White House, in the Yellow Oval Room, Harding allowed bootleg whiskey to be freely served to his guests during after-dinner parties at a time when the President was supposed to enforce Prohibition. One witness, Alice Longworth, stated that trays, \\"...with bottles containing every imaginable brand of whiskey stood about.\\" Some of this alcohol had been directly confiscated from the Prohibition department by Jess Smith, assistant to U.S. Attorney General Harry Daugherty. Mrs. Harding, also known as the \\"Duchess\\", mixed drinks for the guests.Anthony, Carl \\"A President Of the Peephole\\", The Washington Post, June 7, 1998; retrieved December 24, 2010. Harding played poker twice a week, smoked and chewed tobacco. Harding allegedly won a $4,000 pearl necktie pin at one White House poker game. Although criticized by Prohibitionist advocate Wayne B. Wheeler over Washington, D.C. rumors of these \\"wild parties\\", Harding claimed his personal drinking inside the White House was his own business. Though Mrs. Harding did keep a little red book of those who had offended her, the executive mansion was now once again open to the public for events including the annual Easter egg roll. Western tour and death Western tour Harding aboard the presidential train in Alaska, with secretaries Hoover, Wallace, Work, and Mrs. Harding Though Harding wanted to run for a second term, his health began to decline during his time in office. He gave up drinking, sold his \\"life-work,\\" the Marion Star, in part to regain $170,000 previous investment losses, and had Daugherty make him a new will. Harding, along with his personal physician Dr. Charles E. Sawyer, believed getting away from Washington would help relieve the stress of being president. By July 1923, criticism of the Harding Administration was increasing. Prior to his leaving Washington, the president reported chest pains that radiated down his left arm. In June 1923, Harding set out on a journey, which he dubbed the \\"Voyage of Understanding\\". The president planned to cross the country, go north to Alaska Territory, journey south along the West Coast, then travel by navy ship through the Panama Canal, to Puerto Rico, and to return to Washington at the end of August. The trip would allow him to speak widely across the country in advance of the 1924 campaign, and allow him some rest away from Washington's oppressive summer heat. Harding's political advisers had given him a physically demanding schedule, even though the president had ordered it cut back. In Kansas City, Harding spoke on transportation issues; in Hutchinson, Kansas, agriculture was the theme. In Denver, he spoke on Prohibition, and continued west making a series of speeches not matched by any president until Franklin Roosevelt. In addition to making speeches, he visited Yellowstone and Zion National Parks, and dedicated a monument on the Oregon Trail at a celebration organized by venerable pioneer Ezra Meeker and others. On July 5, Harding embarked on in Washington state. The first president to visit Alaska, he spent hours watching the dramatic landscapes from the ship's deck. After several stops along the coast, the presidential party left the ship at Seward to take the Alaska Central Railway to McKinley Park and Fairbanks, where he addressed a crowd of 1,500 in heat. The party was to return to Seward by the Richardson Trail but due to Harding's fatigue, it went by train. Arriving via Vancouver Harbor on July 26, Harding became the first sitting U.S. president to visit Canada. He was greeted dock-side by the premier of British Columbia and the mayor of Vancouver. Thousands lined the streets of Vancouver to watch as the motorcade of dignitaries moved through the city to Stanley Park, where Harding spoke to an audience estimated at over 40,000. In his speech he proclaimed, \\"You are not only our neighbor, but a very good neighbor, and we rejoice in your advancement and admire your independence no less sincerely than we value your friendship.\\" Harding also visited a golf course, but completed only six holes before being fatigued. He was not successful in hiding his exhaustion; one reporter deemed him so tired a rest of mere days would not be sufficient to refresh him. Death The funeral procession for President Harding passes by the front of the White House. Upon returning to the U.S. on July 27, Harding participated in a series of events in Seattle. After reviewing the navy fleet in the harbor and riding in a parade through downtown, he addressed a crowd of over 30,000 Boy Scouts at a jamboree in Woodland Park and then addressed 25,000 people at the University of Washington's Husky Stadium. That evening, in what would be his last official public event, Harding addressed the Seattle Press Club. By the end of the evening Harding was near collapse, and he went to bed early. The next day, all tour stops scheduled between Seattle and San Francisco were cancelled, and the presidential entourage proceeded directly there. Arriving in the city on the morning of July 29, Harding felt well enough that he insisted on walking from the train to the car. However, shortly after arriving at the Palace Hotel he suffered a relapse. Upon examining him, doctors found that not only was Harding's heart causing problems, but he also had a serious case of pneumonia. All public engagements were cancelled. When treated with caffeine and digitalis, Harding seemed to improve. Reports that the released text of his July 31 speech had received a favorable reception also buoyed his spirits, and by the afternoon of August 2, doctors allowed him to sit up in bed. That evening, around 7:30 pm, while Florence Harding was reading a flattering article to the president from The Saturday Evening Post titled \\"A Calm Review of a Calm Man\\", he began twisting convulsively and collapsed. Doctors attempted stimulants, but were unable to revive him, and President Harding died at the age of 57. Although initially attributed to a cerebral hemorrhage, the president's death was most likely the result a heart attack. Harding's death came as a great shock to the nation. The president was liked and admired, and the press and public had followed his illness closely, and been reassured by his apparent recovery. Harding was returned to his train in a casket for a journey across the nation followed closely in the newspapers. Nine million people lined the tracks as Harding's body was taken from San Francisco to Washington, D.C., and after services there, home to Marion, Ohio, for burial. In Marion, Warren Harding's body was placed on a horse-drawn hearse, which was followed by President Coolidge and Chief Justice Taft, then by Harding's wife and father. They followed it through the city, past the Star building where the presses stood silent, and at last to the Marion Cemetery, where the casket was placed in the cemetery's receiving vault. Immediately after Harding's death, Mrs. Harding returned to Washington, D.C. and, according to historian Francis Russell, burned as much of President Harding's correspondence and documents, both official and unofficial, as she could get. However, most of Harding's papers survived because Harding's personal secretary, George Christian, disobeyed Florence Harding's instructions. Historical reputation U.S. Post Office issued a 2-cent Postage stamp commemorating the life of Warren G. Harding.Scotts Specialized Catalogue of United States Stamps: Quantities issued Energized by his 1920 landslide victory, Harding felt the \\"pulse\\" of the nation and for the 28 months in office he remained popular both nationally and internationally. Herbert Hoover, while serving in Harding's cabinet, was confident the president would serve two terms and return the world to normalcy. Later, in his own memoirs, he stated that Harding had \\"neither the experience nor the intellect that the position needed.\\" Trani and Wilson describe Harding as \\"an ineffective leader who suffered both personal and political scandal.\\" Harding has been traditionally ranked as one of the worst presidents. In a 1948 poll conducted by Harvard University historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Sr., the first notable survey of scholars' opinions of the presidents, Harding ranked last among the 29 presidents considered. In a 1962 poll conducted by Schlesinger, he was ranked last again, 31 out of 31. His son, Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., conducted another poll in 1996; once again, Harding was last, ranked 39 out of 39. In 2010, a Siena College Research Institute survey of 238 presidential scholars ranked Harding 41st among the 43 men who had been president, between Franklin Pierce (40th) and James Buchanan (42nd); Andrew Johnson was judged the worst. Harding was also considered the third worst president in a 2002 Siena poll. Siena polls of 1982, 1990 and 1992 ranked him last. A 2008 study of presidential rankings for The Times placed Harding at number 34Griffin, J.; Hines, N. Presidential Rankings, London Sunday Times, October 28, 2008, Retrieved November 24, 2010 and a 2009 C-SPAN survey ranked Harding at 38. A 2017 C-Span poll of historians ranked Harding as the fourth-worst president, as did a 2018 poll of the American Political Science Association’s Presidents and Executive Politics section. Some historians have defended Harding, with many arguing that he was merely below average rather than a total failure. Historian Robert K. Murray wrote that, \\"in establishing the political philosophy and program for an entire decade, [Harding's] 882 days in office were more significant than all but a few similar short periods in the nation's existence.\\" Authors Marcus Raskin and Robert Spero, in 2007, also believed that Harding was underrated, and admired Harding's quest for world peace after World War I and his successful naval disarmament among strongly armed nations, including France, Britain, and Japan.Raskin-Spero (2007), The Four Freedoms Under Siege, p. 242 In his 2010 book The Leaders We Deserved (and a Few We Didn't): Rethinking the Presidential Rating Game, presidential historian Alvin S. Felzenberg, ranking presidents on several criteria, ranked Harding 26th out of 40 presidents considered. See also * Memorials to Warren G. Harding * Cultural depictions of Warren G.

Some installments was developed by Eipix Entertainment between 2015 to 2019 and Elephant Games who developed sequels from 2013 to 2014. Now, the newest installments was developed by GrandMA Studios. The Mystery Case Files series is known for its ‘Hidden Object’ puzzles where, in order to progress through a game, the player plays the role of a Master Detective and must find a certain number of items hidden somewhere on a painted scene. Big Fish Games \\"estimates that 100 million people have at least sampled trial versions\\" of the Mystery Case Files games since the initial launch of Mystery Case Files: Huntsville. The latest installment in the series, Mystery Case Files: The Harbinger, was released on August 20, 2020, and is the 21st game in the series. Gameplay Mystery Case Files: Huntsville marked the introduction of the hidden object game - a genre of casual game development in which a player must locate a list of objects which are hidden among many other objects on the computer screen. Once a player has located all the listed hidden objects, they progress on to the next area of gameplay. In case a player is unable to find a required object, many hidden object games offer a finite number of hints. Like all Mystery Case Files titles, Huntsville relies heavily on hidden object gameplay. Upon completing each hidden object puzzle, players return to their 'Crime Computer' where they solve subsequent puzzles in order to gather evidence and help pinpoint the thief. A player is given a limited amount of time to complete each puzzle. If the player fails to successfully complete a puzzle in this time, he or she must begin again with an entirely new scenario. Prime Suspects relies heavily on hidden object gameplay as well, but introduces a new device that will only work if the player finds batteries in any hidden object scene. The new device enables the player to see through walls to find the hidden object. The player has to gather evidence in a limited amount of time and deduce which suspect is mostly likely to have stolen the Queen's Hope Diamond. Ravenhearst allows the player to gather the missing pages of Emma's diary by relying heavily on hidden object scenes. Puzzles are introduced to the gameplay as players must solve them to unlock each door in the manor in order to access the locked rooms. At the end of the game, keys must be found all around the manor in order to free Emma's soul from the mansion.

He is best known for leading the nation to victory in the Spanish–American War (1898), taking ownership of the Republic of Hawaii, purchasing the Philippines, Guam and Puerto Rico. It includes the 1897 Dingley Tariff to protect manufacturers and factory workers from foreign competition, and the Gold Standard Act of 1900 that rejected free silver inflationary proposals. Rapid economic growth and a decline in labor conflict also marked the presidency. The 25th United States president, McKinley took office following the 1896 presidential election, in which he defeated Democrat William Jennings Bryan. In the campaign, McKinley advocated \\"sound money\\", promised that high tariffs would restore prosperity, and denounced Bryan as a radical who promoted class warfare. He defeated Bryan again in the 1900 presidential election, in a campaign focused on imperialism in the Philippines, high tariffs, and free silver. McKinley's presidency marked the beginning of an era in American political history, called the \\"Fourth Party System\\" or \\"Progressive Era,\\" which lasted from the mid–1890s to the early 1930s. On the national level, this period was generally dominated by the Republican Party. In 1897–98, the most pressing issue was an insurrection in Cuba against repressive Spanish colonial rule which had been worsening for years. Americans sympathized with the rebels and demanded action to resolve the crisis. The administration tried to persuade Spain to liberalize its rule but when negotiations failed, both sides wanted war. American victory in the Spanish–American War was quick and decisive. During the war the United States took temporary possession of Cuba; it was promised independence but it remained under the control of the U.S. Army throughout McKinley's presidency. The status of the Philippines was heavily debated, and became an issue in the 1900 election, with Democrats opposed to American ownership. McKinley decided it needed American protection and it remained under U.S. control until the 1940s. As a result of the war, the United States also took permanent possession of Guam and Puerto Rico. Under McKinley's leadership, the United States also annexed the independent Republic of Hawaii in 1898. Unlike the other new possessions, citizens of Hawaii became American citizens and Hawaii became a territory with an appointed governor. McKinley's foreign policy created an overseas empire and put the U.S. on the world's list of major powers. In 1897 the economy rapidly recovered from the severe depression, called the Panic of 1893. McKinley's supporters in 1900 argued that the new high tariff and the commitment to the gold standard were responsible. Historians looking at his domestic and foreign policies typically rank McKinley as an \\"above average\\" president. Historian Lewis L. Gould argues that McKinley was \\"the first modern president\\": Election of 1896 McKinley rose to prominence within the Republican Party as a congressman closely associated with protective tariffs. He earned national notoriety in the 1880s and 1890s for his nationwide campaigning, and in 1891 he won election as Governor of Ohio. In the lead-up to the 1896 election, McKinley and his manager, Cleveland businessman Mark Hanna, quietly built up support for a presidential bid. When rivals Speaker Thomas Brackett Reed and Senator William B. Allison sent agents outside their states to organize support for their candidacies, they found that McKinley agents had preceded them. By the time the 1896 Republican National Convention began in St. Louis in June, McKinley had an ample majority of delegates, and he won the nomination on the first ballot of the convention. Hanna selected Republican National Committee vice chairman Garret Hobart of New Jersey for vice president. Hobart, a wealthy lawyer, businessman, and former state legislator, was not widely known, but as Hanna biographer Herbert Croly pointed out, \\"if he did little to strengthen the ticket he did nothing to weaken it\\". June 1896 alt=A political cartoon shows McKinley riding a plank of wood marked \\"Cross of Gold speech#Background\\". In the final days before the convention, McKinley decided, after hearing from politicians and businessmen, that the platform should endorse the gold standard, though it should allow for bimetallism by international agreement. Adoption of the platform caused some western delegates, led by Colorado Senator Henry M. Teller, to walk out of the convention. However, Republicans were not nearly as divided on the issue as were Democrats, especially as McKinley promised future concessions to silver advocates. Democratic President Grover Cleveland firmly supported the gold standard, but an increasing number of rural Democrats, especially in corn belt and western states, called for a bimetallic \\"free silver\\" system. The silverites took control of the 1896 Democratic National Convention and chose William Jennings Bryan for president; he had electrified the delegates with his Cross of Gold speech which became famous for its closing phrase, \\"You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns, you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.\\" Bryan's financial radicalism shocked bankers, as many thought that his inflationary program would bankrupt the railroads and ruin the economy. Hanna cultivated the backing of these bankers, giving Republicans a massive financial advantage that allowed McKinley's campaign to invest $3.5 million for speakers and distribute over 200 million pamphlets advocating the Republican position on the money and tariff questions. The Republican Party printed and distributed 200 million pamphlets and sent hundreds of speakers out across the nation to deliver stump speeches on McKinley's behalf. Bryan was portrayed as a radical, a demagogue, and a socialist, while McKinley was cast as the guarantor of full employment and industrial growth. By the end of September, the party had discontinued printing material on the silver issue, and were entirely concentrating on the tariff question. The battleground proved to be the Midwest—the South and most of the West were conceded to the Democrats—and Bryan spent much of his time in those crucial states. 1896 electoral vote results. On November 3, 1896, McKinley was victorious, winning the Electoral College vote 271 to 176, and receiving 7,102,246 popular votes to Bryan's 6,502,925. McKinley won the entire Northeast and Midwest. Bryan had concentrated entirely on the silver issue, and had not failed to broaden his appeal to include urban workers. McKinley's view of a stronger central government building American industry through protective tariffs and a dollar based on gold triumphed. McKinley's coalition included most Northern cities, well-to-do farmers, industrial laborers, and most ethnic voters aside from Irish Americans. The 1896 presidential election is often seen as a realigning election, as with it the nation's focus shifted from repairing the damage caused by the Civil War, to building for the future through social reform.Walter Dean Burnham, \\"The system of 1896: An analysis.\\" in Paul Kleppner et al. The evolution of American electoral systems (1981): 166–69. It was also a realigning election in that it launched a long period of Republican control over Congress and the White House, the Fourth Party System, that would continue until 1932. First inauguration Chief Justice Melville Fuller swears in William McKinley as president; outgoing President Grover Cleveland at right. McKinley's first presidential inauguration was held on March 4, 1897, in front of the Original Senate Wing, at the U.S. Capitol. Chief Justice Melville Fuller administered the oath of office. It was the first inaugural ceremony recorded by a motion picture camera. McKinley gave a lengthy inaugural address, in which he urged tariff reform, and stated that the currency issue would have to await tariff legislation. He also warned against U.S. foreign interventions, declaring, Nick Kapur says that McKinley's priorities were based on his values of arbitrationism, pacifism, humanitarianism, and manly self-restraint, and not on external pressures.Nick Kapur, \\"William McKinley's Values and the Origins of the Spanish‐American War: A Reinterpretation.\\" Presidential Studies Quarterly 41.1 (2011): 18-38 online. Administration Maine Congressman Nelson Dingley Jr. was McKinley's first choice for secretary of the treasury, but Dingley preferred to remain as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Charles Dawes, who had been Hanna's lieutenant in Chicago during the campaign, was considered for the Treasury post but by some accounts Dawes considered himself too young; he would instead become the comptroller of the currency in 1898. McKinley ultimately appointed Lyman J. Gage, president of the First National Bank of Chicago and a Gold Democrat, as secretary of the treasury. Leadership of the Navy Department went to former Massachusetts Congressman John Davis Long, an old colleague of McKinley's from his time serving in the House of the Representatives. Although McKinley was initially inclined to allow Long to choose his own the assistant secretary of the navy, there was considerable pressure on the president-elect to appoint Theodore Roosevelt, the head of the New York City Police Commission. McKinley was reluctant to appoint Roosevelt, stating to one Roosevelt booster, \\"I want peace and I am told that your friend Theodore is always getting into rows with everybody.\\" Nevertheless, he appointed Roosevelt. McKinley chose James Wilson, a former congressman with strong support in the state of Iowa, to be his secretary of agriculture. McKinley's first choice for Postmaster General was Mark Hanna, but he declined the position. McKinley also considered appointing Henry Clay Payne, but opposition from Robert M. La Follette's faction of the party convinced him to appoint another individual. McKinley settled on James Albert Gary, a Republican from Maryland. For the position of Attorney General, McKinley turned to another old friend from the House, Joseph McKenna of California. Cornelius Newton Bliss, who was acceptable to the divided New York Republican Party, was selected as the secretary of the interior. The position of secretary of war went to Russell A. Alger, a former general who had also served as the governor of Michigan. Competent enough in peacetime, Alger proved inadequate once the Spanish–American War began. With the War Department plagued by scandal, Alger resigned at McKinley's request in mid-1899 and was succeeded by Elihu Root. During the war, General Henry Clark Corbin gained McKinley's trust as the adjutant general of the army, and Corbin acted as the de facto commander of the army under McKinley administration's auspices. President McKinley and his Cabinet, 1898 At far left: William McKinley. Left to right in back of table: Lyman J. Gage, John W. Griggs, John D. Long, James Wilson standing, and Cornelius N. Bliss. Left to right in front of table: John Hay, Russell A. Alger, and Charles E. Smith McKinley's most controversial Cabinet appointment was that of John Sherman as secretary of state. Sherman was not McKinley's first choice for the position; he initially offered it to Senator William Allison. One consideration in Senator Sherman's appointment was to provide a place in the Senate for Hanna, and, as Sherman had served as secretary of the treasury under President Rutherford B. Hayes, only the State position was likely to entice him from the Senate. Sherman's mental faculties were decaying even in 1896; this was widely spoken of in political circles, but McKinley did not believe the rumors. Sherman's mental incapacity became increasingly apparent after he took office. He was often bypassed by his first assistant, McKinley's Canton crony William R. Day, and by the second secretary, Alvey A. Adee. Day, an Ohio lawyer unfamiliar with diplomacy, was often reticent in meetings; Adee was somewhat deaf. One diplomat characterized the arrangement, \\"the head of the department knew nothing, the first assistant said nothing, and the second assistant heard nothing\\". McKinley asked Sherman to resign in 1898, and Day became the new secretary of state. Later that year, Day was succeeded by John Hay, a veteran diplomat who had served as assistant secretary of state in the Hayes Administration. McKinley made two other changes to his Cabinet in 1898; Charles Emory Smith succeeded the ailing Gary as Postmaster General, while John W. Griggs replaced McKenna as Attorney General after McKenna joined the Supreme Court. For most of McKinley's time in office, George B. Cortelyou served as the president's personal secretary. Cortelyou acted as the de facto White House press secretary and chief of staff. Vice President Garret Hobart, as was customary at the time, was not invited to Cabinet meetings, but he proved a valuable adviser to McKinley. Hobart leased a residence close to the White House, and the two families visited each other without formality. Hobart died of heart disease in November 1899. As no constitutional provision existed for filling an intra-term vacancy in the vice presidency (prior to ratification of the Twenty-fifth Amendment in 1967), the office was left vacant for the balance of his term. In March 1901, Theodore Roosevelt, who served as McKinley's running mate in the 1900 election, became vice president. Judicial appointments After the retirement of Justice Stephen Johnson Field, McKinley appointed Attorney General Joseph McKenna to the Supreme Court of the United States in December 1897. The appointment aroused some controversy as McKenna's critics in the Senate said he was too closely associated with railroad interests and lacked the qualifications of a Supreme Court justice. Despite the objections, McKenna's nomination was approved unanimously. McKenna responded to the criticism of his legal education by taking some courses at Columbia Law School for several months before taking his seat. McKenna served on the court until 1925, often taking centrist positions between more conservative and more progressive judges. Along with his Supreme Court appointment, McKinley appointed six judges to the United States Courts of Appeals, and 28 judges to the United States district courts. Domestic affairs Economy and trusts 1899 antitrust cartoon by Homer Davenport The long, deep depression that followed the Panic of 1893 finally ended in late 1896, as all the economic indicators in 1897 turned positive. Business newspapers and magazines were filled with optimistic reports throughout 1897. The New York Commercial of 3 January 1898 surveyed a wide variety of businesses and industries nationwide and concluded, \\"after three years of waiting and of false starts, the groundswell of demand is at last begun to rise with the steadiness which leaves little doubt that an era of prosperity has appeared.\\" It reported that January 1898 represents \\"a supreme moment in the period of transition from depression to comparative prosperity.\\"Julius W. Pratt, \\"American business and the Spanish–American War.\\" Hispanic American Historical Review 14#2 (1934): 163–201, quote p. 166. The only soft spot was in the cotton goods industry. The unemployment rate, which had been at nearly 20 percent in 1895, dropped to 15 percent in 1897 and to 8 percent in early 1898. McKinley largely adhered to the laissez-faire attitude that the Cleveland administration had held towards trusts. Attorneys General Joseph McKenna and John W. Griggs pursued some antitrust cases under the terms of the Sherman Antitrust Act and the Supreme Court case of United States v. E. C. Knight Co., but the McKinley administration sympathized with the view that consolidation could be beneficial in many cases. Debate over the role of trusts grew throughout McKinley's presidency, and the issue would become increasingly important after McKinley's presidency. Tariffs and monetary policy =Dingley Tariff= 1900 reelection poster celebrates McKinley standing tall on the gold standard with support from soldiers, sailors, businessmen, factory workers and professionals. After the 1896 election, McKinley indicated that he would call special session of Congress to address the tariff, and Congressman Dingley began hearings on the bill in December 1896, during the lame duck period of Cleveland's presidency. While Democrats tended to oppose high tariffs, arguing that they hurt consumers by raising prices, McKinley and other leading Republicans viewed high tariffs as essential to the protection of American businesses against foreign competition. Additionally, the tariff provided nearly half of the government's revenue, and a rate increase could help put an end to the deficits that the government had experienced in the midst of the Panic of 1893. Before taking office, McKinley also authorized Senator Edward O. Wolcott of Colorado to travel to Europe to discuss the possibility of an international bimetallic agreement. International bimetallism represented a middle course between proponents of free silver and those who favored a gold standard. When the special session of Congress convened in March 1897, Dingley introduced the Dingley Act to revise the Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act of 1894. McKinley supported the bill, which increased tariffs on wool, sugar, and luxury goods, but the proposed new rates alarmed the French, who exported many luxury items to the United States.Robert P. Porter, \\"The Dingley Tariff Bill.\\" The North American Review 164#486 (1897): 576–84. in JSTOR The Dingley Act passed the House easily, but faced resistance in the Senate. Passage of the bill in the Senate required the support of several Western Republicans, including Wolcott, whose chief priority was an international agreement on bimetallism. French representatives offered to cooperate with the United States in developing such an international agreement if the new tariff rates were reduced. Led by Wolcott, Allison, Nelson Aldrich, and Orville H. Platt, the Senate amended the Dingley Bill to lower rates on French products and approved of a commission charged with negotiating the international bimetallic agreement. As doubts about the likelihood of reaching an international monetary agreement grew, the Senate inserted a provision that authorized the president to reach bilateral treaties providing for the mutual reduction of tariff duties. The Senate passed its version of the bill in July 1897, and a conference committee produced a final bill that contained the reciprocity provision but generally adhered to the higher tariff rates set by the original House bill. McKinley, who strongly supported the idea of reciprocity, signed the Dingley Act into law in late July 1897. The McKinley administration later reached reciprocity treaties with France and other countries, but opposition in the Senate prevented their ratification. =Monetary policy= While Congress debated the tariff, the U.S. and France approached Britain to gauge its enthusiasm for bimetallism. The government of Prime Minister Lord Salisbury showed some interest in the idea and told Wolcott that he would be amenable to reopening the mints in India to silver coinage if the Indian Viceroy's Executive Council agreed. News of a possible departure from the gold standard stirred up immediate opposition from gold partisans, and misgivings by the Indian administration led Britain to reject the proposal. Opposition from Britain led to the collapse of negotiations for joint adoption of bimetallism by France, Britain, and the United States. With the international effort a failure, McKinley turned away from silver coinage and embraced the gold standard. Agitation for free silver eased as prosperity returned and gold from recent strikes in the Yukon and Australia increased the monetary supply even without silver coinage. In the absence of international agreement, McKinley favored legislation to formally affirm the gold standard, but was initially deterred by the silver strength in the Senate. In 1900, with another campaign ahead, McKinley urged Congress to pass such a law while economic conditions were strong. Aldrich and other leading Senate Republicans fashioned a bill that established gold as the only standard for the redemption of paper money, but placated Wolcott and other Western Republicans by including a provision allowing for international bimetallism. The Senate passed the bill in a near- party-line vote in March 1900, and McKinley signed the bill into law later that month. Democrats tried to make free silver a campaign issue in 1900, but it failed to attract much attention.Thomas A. Bailey, \\"Was the Presidential Election of 1900 a Mandate on Imperialism?.\\" Mississippi Valley Historical Review 24.1 (1937): 43–52. in JSTOR Pluralism A key element of McKinley's appeal in an 1896 election was the spirit of pluralism. No group in America was to be ostracized or banned. Everyone was welcome to enjoy the new prosperity.Richard Jensen, The Winning of the Midwest: Social and Political Conflict, 1888–1896 (1971) pp. 269–308. McKinley had a very broad appeal in terms of race, ethnicity, region and class. Where Bryan had ridiculed and denounced bankers and railroads, McKinley welcomed the business community. McKinley was famous as a champion of high tariffs to protect the high wages of American factory workers. Proposals for immigration restriction, and attacks on Jews, Eastern Europeans and Southern Europeans had no place in the McKinley administration. He appointed Irish Catholic labor leader Terence Vincent Powderly founder of the Knights of Labor organization, as Commissioner-General of Immigration.Edward T. James, \\"T.V. Powderly, a Political Profile.\\" Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography 99.4 (1975): 443–59. online Immigration restrictions such as literacy tests proposed by Republican Senator Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts and his allies in the Immigration Restriction League (founded in 1894) had been included in the 1896 GOP platform, but McKinley and the party leadership in Congress blocked their passage.Roger Daniels, Guarding the Golden Door: American Immigration Policy and Immigrants Since 1882 (2004) pp. 32–33. The anti-Catholicism that had started to appear in the 1890s faded away, as shown by the rapid decline of the American Protective Association.John E. Wiltz, \\"APA-ism in Kentucky and Elsewhere.\\" Register of the Kentucky Historical Society 56.2 (1958): 143–55. in JSTOR Nonetheless, restrictive immigration laws would continue to receive support during and after McKinley's tenure, partly due to the rising number of immigrants from Southern Europe and Eastern Europe. =Reconciliation with Southern whites= A high priority for McKinley's pluralism was full unification of the white South psychologically and patriotically back into the United States. This initiative conflicted with the civil rights of blacks, which were being increasingly restricted in the South. While McKinley did not officially endorse the \\"Lost Cause of the Confederacy\\", he did reach out in terms of appointments and speeches and visits to the white South. Reconciliation was achieved during the Spanish–American War, as enlistment rates across the South were quite high. The swift stunning victory certainly boosted the reconciliation process.Paul H. Buck, Road to reunion, 1865–1900 (1938). Historian David W. Blight argues: =Growing racial tensions= The black vote supported McKinley in 1896 and African Americans were hopeful of progress towards racial equality. McKinley had spoken out against lynching while governor, and most African Americans who could vote supported him in 1896. McKinley's priority, however, was in ending sectionalism, and African Americans were generally disappointed by his policies and appointments. Although McKinley made some appointments of African Americans to low-level government posts, and received some praise for that, the appointments were less than they had received under previous Republican administrations. Blanche Bruce, an African American who during Reconstruction had served as senator from Mississippi, received the post of register at the Treasury Department; this post was traditionally given to an African American by Republican presidents. McKinley appointed several black postmasters; however, when whites protested the appointment of Justin W. Lyons as postmaster of Augusta, Georgia, McKinley asked Lyons to withdraw (he was subsequently given the post of Treasury register after Bruce's death in 1898). The president also appointed George B. Jackson, a former slave, to the post of customs collector in Presidio, Texas. African Americans in Northern states felt that their contributions to McKinley's victory were overlooked, as few were appointed to office. McKinley, (right of center) flanked by Georgia Governor Allen D. Candler (front row to McKinley's left) and Gen. William Rufus Shafter, reviewing the Atlanta Peace Jubilee parade, December 15, 1898. African Americans saw the onset of war in 1898 as an opportunity to display their patriotism, and black soldiers fought bravely at El Caney and San Juan Hill. African Americans in the peacetime Army had formed elite units; nevertheless they were harassed by whites as they traveled from the West to Tampa for embarkation to the war. Under pressure from black leaders, McKinley required the War Department to commission black officers above the rank of lieutenant. The heroism of the black troops did not still racial tensions in the South, as the second half of 1898 saw several outbreaks of racial violence; eleven African Americans were killed in riots in Wilmington, North Carolina. McKinley toured the South in late 1898, hoping for sectional reconciliation. In addition to visiting Tuskegee Institute and Booker T. Washington, he addressed the Georgia legislature, wearing a badge of gray, and visited Confederate memorials. In his tour of the South, McKinley did not mention the racial tensions or violence. Although the president received a rapturous reception from Southern whites, many African Americans, excluded from official welcoming committees, felt alienated by the president's words and actions. The administration's response to racial violence was minimal, causing McKinley to lose further black support. When black postmasters were assaulted at Hogansville, Georgia in 1897, and at Lake City, South Carolina the following year, McKinley issued no statement of condemnation. Although black leaders criticized McKinley for inaction, supporters responded by saying there was little the president could do to intervene. Critics replied by saying that he could at least publicly condemn such events, as former President Benjamin Harrison had done. McKinley also took no action to prevent the passage of Jim Crow laws designed to disenfranchise and segregate African Americans in the South. According to Gould and later biographer Phillips, given the political climate in the South, there was little McKinley could have done to improve race relations, and he did better than later presidents Theodore Roosevelt, who doubted racial equality, and Woodrow Wilson, who supported segregation. Foreign affairs Nick Kapur argues that McKinley's foreign policy was rooted not in various pressure groups but in his deeply held \\"Victorian\\" values, especially arbitration, pacifism, humanitarianism, and manly self- restraint.Nick Kapur, \\"William McKinley's Values and the Origins of the Spanish‐American War: A Reinterpretation.\\" Presidential Studies Quarterly 41.1 (2011): 18-38. Annexation of Hawaii Annexation of the Republic of Hawaii in 1898 Hawaii long had very close political, cultural, religious and economic relations with the United States. The native population was virtually powerless in small villages. Large sugar interests had imported tens of thousands of workers, mostly Japanese. Expansionists spoke of annexation and the business community in Honolulu wanted annexation by the U.S., fearing that otherwise Japan would take it over from a king who had no army. The reciprocity treaty in the 1870s had made the Kingdom of Hawaii a \\"virtual satellite\\" of the United States. After Queen Liliʻuokalani announced plans to issue a new constitution designed to give her absolute power, she was immediately overthrown by the business community, which requested annexation by the United States. President Harrison tried to annex Hawaii, but his term ended before he could win Senate approval of an annexation treaty, and Cleveland withdrew the treaty. Cleveland deeply opposed annexation because of a personal conviction that would not tolerate what he viewed as an immoral action against the little kingdom. Additionally, annexation faced opposition from domestic sugar interests opposed to the importation of Hawaiian sugar, and from some Democrats who opposed acquiring an island with a large non-white population. The temporary government of Hawaii thereupon established the Republic of Hawaii which was recognized by the world powers as an independent nation. McKinley pursued the annexation of the Republic of Hawaii as one of his top foreign policy priorities. In American hands, Hawaii would serve as a base to dominate much of the Pacific, defend the Pacific Coast, and expand trade with Asia. Republican Congressman William Sulzer stated that \\"the Hawaiian Islands will be the key that will unlock to us the commerce of the Orient.\\" McKinley stated, \\"we need Hawaii just as much and a good deal more than we did California. It is manifest destiny.\\" President McKinley's position was that Hawaii could never survive on its own. It would quickly be gobbled up by Japan—already a fourth of the islands' population was Japanese.Hilary Conroy The Japanese Frontier in Hawaii, 1868–1898 (U of California Press, 1953). Japan would then dominate the Pacific and undermine American hopes for large-scale trade with Asia.Thomas J. Osborne, \\"The Main Reason for Hawaiian Annexation in July, 1898,\\" Oregon Historical Quarterly (1970) 71#2 pp. 161–178 in JSTORWilliam Michael Morgan, \\"The anti-Japanese origins of the Hawaiian Annexation treaty of 1897.\\" Diplomatic History 6.1 (1982): 23-44 online. The issue of annexation became a major political issue heatedly debated across the United States, which carried over into the 1900 presidential election. By then the national consensus was in favor of the annexation of both Hawaii and the Philippines. Historian Henry Graff says that in the mid-1890s, \\"unmistakably, the sentiment at home was maturing with immense force for the United States to join the great powers of the world in a quest for overseas colonies.\\" The drive for expansion was opposed by a vigorous nationwide anti-expansionist movement, organized as the American Anti-Imperialist League. The anti- imperialists listened to Bryan as well as industrialist Andrew Carnegie, author Mark Twain, sociologist William Graham Sumner, and many older reformers from the Civil War era.Fred H. Harrington, \\"The Anti-Imperialist Movement in the United States, 1898–1900.\\" Mississippi Valley Historical Review 22#2 (1935): 211–230. online The anti-imperialists believed that imperialism violated the fundamental principle that just republican government must derive from \\"consent of the governed.\\" The anti-imperialist league argued that such activity would necessitate the abandonment of American ideals of self- government and non-intervention—ideals expressed in the Declaration of Independence, George Washington's Farewell Address and Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.Fred Harvey Harrington, \\"Literary Aspects of American Anti- Imperialism 1898–1902,\\" New England Quarterly, 10#4 (1937), pp 650–67. online.Robert L. Beisner, Twelve Against Empire: The Anti-Imperialists, 1898–1900 (1968). However, the anti-imperialists could not stop the even more energetic forces of imperialism. They were led by Secretary of State Hay, naval strategist Alfred T. Mahan, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, Secretary of War Root, and Theodore Roosevelt. These expansionists had vigorous support from newspaper publishers William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer, who whipped up popular excitement. Mahan and Roosevelt designed a global strategy calling for a competitive modern navy, Pacific bases, an isthmian canal through Nicaragua or Panama, and, above all, an assertive role for the United States as the largest industrial power.Warren Zimmermann, \\"Jingoes, Goo-Goos, and the Rise of America's Empire.\\" The Wilson Quarterly (1976) 22#2 (1998): 42–65. Online They warned that Japan was sending a warship and was poised to seize an independent Hawaii, and thereby be within range of California—a threat that alarmed the West Coast. The Navy prepared the first plans regarding a war with Japan.William Michael Morgan, Pacific Gibraltar: U.S.-Japanese Rivalry Over the Annexation of Hawaii, 1885–1898 (2011) pp 200–1; see online review. McKinley submitted an annexation treaty in June 1897, but anti-imperialists prevented it from winning the support of two-thirds of the Senate. In mid-1898, during the Spanish–American War, McKinley and his congressional allies made another attempt to win congressional approval of an annexation measure. With McKinley's support, Democratic Representative Francis G. Newlands of Nevada introduced a joint resolution that provided for the annexation of Hawaii. The Newlands Resolution faced significant resistance from Democrats and anti-expansionist Republicans like Speaker of the House Reed, but pressure from McKinley helped the bill win passage by wide margins in both houses of Congress. McKinley signed the Newlands Resolution into law on July 8, 1898. McKinley biographer H. Wayne Morgan notes, \\"McKinley was the guiding spirit behind the annexation of Hawaii, showing ... a firmness in pursuing it\\". Congress passed the Hawaiian Organic Act in 1900, establishing the Territory of Hawaii. McKinley appointed Sanford B. Dole, who had served as the president of the Republic of Hawaii from 1894 to 1898, as the first territorial governor. Spanish–American War =Cuban crisis= Columbia (the American people) reaches out to help oppressed Cuba in 1897 while Uncle Sam (the U.S. government) is blind to the crisis and will not use its powerful guns to help. Judge magazine, February 6, 1897. By the time McKinley took office, rebels in Cuba had waged an intermittent campaign for freedom from Spanish colonial rule for decades. By 1895, the conflict had expanded to a war for independence. The United States and Cuba enjoyed close trade relations, and the Cuban rebellion adversely affected the American economy which was already weakened by the depression. As rebellion engulfed the island, Spanish reprisals grew ever harsher, and Spanish authorities began removing Cuban families to guarded camps near Spanish military bases. The rebels put high priority on their appeals to the sympathy of ordinary Americans, and public opinion increasingly favored the rebels.George W. Auxier, \\"The propaganda activities of the Cuban Junta in precipitating the Spanish–American War, 1895–1898.\\" Hispanic American Historical Review 19.3 (1939): 286–305 in JSTOR. President Cleveland had supported continued Spanish control of the island, as he feared that Cuban independence would lead to a racial war or intervention by another European power. McKinley also favored a peaceful approach, but he hoped to convince Spain to grant Cuba independence, or at least to allow the Cubans some measure of autonomy. The United States and Spain began negotiations on the subject in 1897, but it became clear that Spain would never concede Cuban independence, while the rebels and their American supporters would never settle for anything less. Business interests overwhelmingly gave strong support to McKinley's go-slow policies. Big business, high finance, and Main Street businesses across the country were vocally opposed to war and demanded peace, as the uncertainties of a potentially long, expensive war posed serious threat to full economic recovery. The leading railroad magazine editorialized, \\"from a commercial and mercenary standpoint it seems peculiarly bitter that this war should come when the country had already suffered so much and so needed rest and peace.\\" The strong anti-war consensus of the business community strengthened McKinley's resolve to use diplomacy and negotiation rather than brute force to end the Spanish tyranny in Cuba.Julius W. Pratt, \\"American business and the Spanish–American War.\\" Hispanic American Historical Review 14#2 (1934): 163–201. in JSTOR, quote on p. 168. On the other hand, humanitarian sensibilities reached fever pitch as church leaders and activists wrote hundreds of thousands of letters to political leaders, calling for intervention in Cuba. These political leaders in turn pressured McKinley to turn the ultimate decision for war over to Congress. In January 1898, Spain promised some concessions to the rebels, but when American consul Fitzhugh Lee reported riots in Havana, McKinley obtained Spanish permission to send the battleship USS Maine to Havana to demonstrate American concern. On February 15, the Maine exploded and sank with 266 men killed. Public opinion was disgusted with Spain for losing control of the situation, but McKinley insisted that a court of inquiry determine whether the explosion of the Maine was accidental. Negotiations with Spain continued as the court of inquiry considered the evidence, but on March 20, the court ruled that the Maine was blown up by an underwater mine. As pressure for war mounted in Congress, McKinley continued to negotiate for Cuban independence. Spain refused McKinley's proposals, and on April 11, McKinley turned the matter over to Congress. He did not ask for war, but Congress declared war anyway on April 20, with the addition of the Teller Amendment, which disavowed any intention of annexing Cuba. European powers called on Spain to negotiate and give in; Britain supported the American position.Sylvia L. Hilton and Steve Ickringill, European Perceptions of the Spanish–American War of 1898 (Peter Lang, 1999). Spain ignored the calls and fought the hopeless war alone in order to defend its honor and keep the monarchy alive. =Historical interpretations of McKinley's role= McKinley put it succinctly in late 1897 that if Spain failed to resolve its crisis, the United States would see “a duty imposed by our obligations to ourselves, to civilization and humanity to intervene with force.\\"See William McKinley “First Annual Message” December 6, 1897. Most historians argue that an upsurge of humanitarian concern with the plight of the Cubans was the main motivating force that caused the war with Spain in 1898.Jules R Benjamin says, \\"The liberation theme has been the one around which the intervention has been understood by most U.S. historians.” Benjamin, “Feature Review” Diplomatic history (September 2000) 24#4 page 655. Louis Perez states, \\"Certainly the moralistic determinants of war in 1898 has been accorded preponderant explanatory weight in the historiography.\\"Perez has a different view emphasizing the central role of American self interest. Louis A. Perez, Jr., review, in Journal of American History (Dec. 2006), p 889. See more detail in Perez, The War of 1898: The United States and Cuba in History and Historiography (1998) pp 23–56. By the 1950s, however, some political scientists said that policy was unwise because it was based on idealism, arguing that a better policy would have been realism in terms of American self interest. They discredited the idealism by suggesting the people were deliberately misled by propaganda and sensationalist yellow journalism. Political scientist Robert Osgood, writing in 1953, led the attack on the American decision process as a confused mix of \\"self-righteousness and genuine moral fervor,\\" in the form of a \\"crusade\\" and a combination of \\"knight- errantry and national self- assertiveness.\\"Perez (1998) pp 46–47. Osgood argued: :A war to free Cuba from Spanish despotism, corruption, and cruelty, from the filth and disease and barbarity of General 'Butcher' Weyler's reconcentration camps, from the devastation of haciendas, the extermination of families, and the outraging of women; that would be a blow for humanity and democracy.... No one could doubt it if he believed – and skepticism was not popular – the exaggerations of the Cuban Junta’s propaganda and the lurid distortions and imaginative lies pervade by the “yellow sheets” of Hearst and Pulitzer at the combined rate of 2 million [newspaper copies] a day.Robert Endicott Osgood, Ideals and self-interest in America's foreign relations: The great transformation of the twentieth century (1953) p 43. For much of the 20th century historians and textbooks disparaged McKinley as a weak leader—echoing Roosevelt, who called him spineless. They blamed McKinley for losing control of foreign policy and agreeing to an unnecessary war. A wave of new scholarship in the 1970s, from both right and left, reversed the older interpretation.Joseph A. Fry, \\"William McKinley and the coming of the Spanish–American War: A study of the besmirching and redemption of an historical image.\\" Diplomatic History 3#1 (1979): 77–98. Robert L. Beisner summed up the new views of McKinley as a strong leader. He said McKinley called for war—not because he was bellicose, but because he wanted: :what only war could bring—an end to the Cuban rebellion, which outraged his humanitarian impulses, prolonged instability in the economy, destroyed American investments and trade with Cuba, created a dangerous picture of an America unable to master the affairs of the Caribbean, threatened to arouse uncontrollable outburst of jingoism, and diverted the attention of U.S. policymakers from historic happenings in China. Neither spineless nor bellicose, McKinley demanded what seemed to him morally unavoidable and essential to American interests.Robert L. Beisner, From the Old Diplomacy to the New, 1865–1900 (New York, 1975), p. 114 Along similar lines Joseph Fry summarizes the new scholarly appraisals: :McKinley was a decent, sensitive man with considerable personal courage and great political facility. A master manager of men, he tightly controlled policy decisions within his administration....Fully cognizant of the United States' economic, strategic, and humanitarian interests, he had laid out a \\"policy\\" early in his administration that ultimately and logically led to war. If Spain could not quell the rebellion through \\"civilized\\" warfare, the United States would have to intervene. In early 1898, the Havana riots, the De Lome letter, the destruction of the Maine, and the Redfield Proctor speech convinced McKinley that the autonomy project had failed and that Spain could not defeat the rebels. He then demanded Cuban independence to end both the suffering on the island and the uncertainty in American political and economic affairs.Joseph A. Fry, \\"William McKinley and the Coming of the Spanish–American War: A Study of the Besmirching and Redemption of an Historical Image\\" Diplomatic History (1979) 3#1 p 96 =Course of the war= The telegraph and the telephone gave McKinley a greater control over the day-to-day management of the war than previous presidents had enjoyed. He set up the first war room and used the new technologies to direct the army's and navy's movements. McKinley did not get along with the Army's commanding general, Nelson A. Miles. Bypassing Miles and Secretary of War Alger, the president looked for strategic advice first from Miles's predecessor, General John Schofield, and later from Adjutant General Henry Clarke Corbin. McKinley presided over an expansion of the Regular Army from 25,000 to 61,000 personnel; including volunteers, a total of 278,000 men served in the Army during the war. McKinley not only wanted to win the war, he also sought to bring North and South together again, as white Southerners enthusiastically supported the war effort, and one senior command went to a former Confederate General. His ideal was a unity with Northerner and Southerner, white and black, fighting together for the United States.David W BUght, Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory (2001), pp. 350–54.Robert J. Norrell, Up from History: The Life of Booker T. Washington (2009) pp. 164, 168–69, 289. Since 1895, the Navy had planned to attack the Philippines if war broke out between the United States and Spain. On April 24, McKinley ordered the Asiatic Squadron under the command of Commodore George Dewey to launch an attack on the Philippines. On May 1, Dewey's force defeated the Spanish navy at the Battle of Manila Bay, destroying Spanish naval power in the Pacific. The next month, McKinley increased the number of troops sent to the Philippines and granted the force's commander, Major General Wesley Merritt, the power to set up legal systems and raise taxes—necessities for a long occupation.David P. Barrows, \\"The Governor-General of the Philippines Under Spain and the United States.\\" American Historical Review 21.2 (1916): 288–311. online By the time the troops arrived in the Philippines at the end of June 1898, McKinley had decided that Spain would be required to surrender the archipelago to the United States. He professed to be open to all views on the subject; however, he believed that as the war progressed, the public would come to demand retention of the islands as a prize of war, and he feared that Japan or possibly Germany might seize the islands.Paolo E. Coletta, \\"McKinley, the Peace Negotiations, and the Acquisition of the Philippines.\\" Pacific Historical Review 30.4 (1961): 341–50. Meanwhile, in the Caribbean theater, a large force of regulars and volunteers gathered near Tampa, Florida, for an invasion of Cuba. The army faced difficulties in supplying the rapidly expanding force even before they departed for Cuba, but by June, Corbin had made progress in resolving the problems. The U.S. Navy began a blockade of Cuba in April while the Army prepared to invade the island, on which Spain maintained a garrison of approximately 80,000. Disease was a major factor: for every American soldier killed in combat in 1898, seven died of disease. The U.S. Army Medical Corps made great strides in treating tropical diseases.Vincent J. Cirillo, Bullets and Bacilli: The Spanish–American War and Military Medicine (Rutgers UP, 2004). There were lengthy delays in Florida—Colonel William Jennings Bryan spent the entire war there as his militia unit was never sent to combat. \\"Well, I hardly know which to take first!\\" exclaims Uncle Sam in this May 18, 1898, editorial cartoon celebrating the spoils of victory. The combat army, led by Major General William Rufus Shafter, sailed from Florida on June 20, landing near Santiago de Cuba two days later. Following a skirmish at Las Guasimas on June 24, Shafter's army engaged the Spanish forces on July 2 in the Battle of San Juan Hill. In an intense day-long battle, the American force was victorious, although both sides suffered heavy casualties.Angus Konstam, San Juan Hill 1898: America's emergence as a world power (Bloomsbury, 2013. Leonard Wood and Theodore Roosevelt, who had resigned as assistant secretary of the Navy, led the \\"Rough Riders\\" into combat. Roosevelt's battlefield exploits would later propel him to the governorship of New York in the fall election of 1898.Edmund Morris, The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt (1979) pp. 646–743. After the American victory at San Juan Hill, the Spanish Caribbean squadron, which had been sheltering in Santiago's harbor, broke for the open sea. The Spanish fleet was intercepted and destroyed by Rear Admiral William T. Sampson's North Atlantic Squadron in the Battle of Santiago de Cuba, the largest naval battle of the war.Jim Leeke, Manila and Santiago: The New Steel Navy in the Spanish–American War (Naval Institute Press, 2013). Shafter laid siege to the city of Santiago, which surrendered on July 17, placing Cuba under effective American control. McKinley and Miles also ordered an invasion of Puerto Rico, which met little resistance when it landed in July. The distance from Spain and the destruction of the Spanish navy made resupply impossible, and the Spanish government—its honor intact after losing to a much more powerful army and navy—began to look for a way to end the war. =Peace treaty= Treaty of Paris On July 22, the Spanish authorized Jules Cambon, the French Ambassador to the United States, to represent Spain in negotiating peace.John Offner, \\"The United States and France: Ending the Spanish–American War.\\" Diplomatic History 7.1 (1983): 1–22. The Spanish initially wished to restrict their territorial loss to Cuba, but were quickly forced to recognize that their other possessions would be claimed as spoils of war. McKinley's Cabinet unanimously agreed that Spain must leave Cuba and Puerto Rico, but they disagreed on the Philippines, with some wishing to annex the entire archipelago and some wishing only to retain a naval base in the area. Although public sentiment mostly favored annexation of the Philippines, prominent Democrats like Bryan and Grover Cleveland, along with some intellectuals and older Republicans, opposed annexation. These annexation opponents formed the American Anti-Imperialist League.Fred H. Harrington, \\"The Anti-Imperialist Movement in the United States, 1898–1900,\\" Mississippi Valley Historical Review (1935) 22#2 pp. 211–30 in JSTOR McKinley ultimately decided he had no choice but to annex the Philippines, because he believed Japan would take control of them if the U.S. did not.Ephraim K. Smith, \\"'A Question from Which We Could Not Escape': William McKinley and the Decision to Acquire the Philippine Islands.\\" Diplomatic History 9.4 (1985): 363–75. McKinley proposed to open negotiations with Spain on the basis of Cuban liberation and Puerto Rican annexation, with the final status of the Philippines subject to further discussion. He stood firmly in that demand even as the military situation on Cuba began to deteriorate when the American army was struck with yellow fever. Spain ultimately agreed to a ceasefire on those terms on August 12, and treaty negotiations began in Paris in September 1898. The talks continued until December 18, when the Treaty of Paris was signed. The United States acquired Puerto Rico and the Philippines as well as the island of Guam, and Spain relinquished its claims to Cuba; in exchange, the United States agreed to pay Spain $20 million. McKinley had difficulty convincing the Senate to approve the treaty by the requisite two-thirds vote, but his lobbying, and that of Vice President Hobart, eventually saw success, as the Senate voted to ratify the treaty on February 6, 1899 on a 57 to 27 vote. Though a significant bloc of senators opposed the treaty, they were unable to unite behind an alternative to ratification. Cuba came under temporary American occupation, which gave Army doctors under Walter Reed the chance to implement major medical reforms and eliminate yellow fever.Graham A. Cosmas, \\"Securing the Fruits of Victory: The US Army Occupies Cuba, 1898–1899.\\" Military Affairs: The Journal of Military History (1974): 85–91.John R. Pierce, Yellow jack: how yellow fever ravaged America and Walter Reed discovered its deadly secrets (Wiley, 2005). =The new American empire= Cuba was devastated from the war and from the long insurrection against Spanish rule, and McKinley refused to recognize the Cuban rebels as the official government of the island. Nonetheless, McKinley felt bound by the Teller Amendment, and he established a military government on the island with the intention of ultimately granting Cuba independence. Many Republican leaders, including Roosevelt and possibly McKinley himself, hoped that benevolent American leadership of Cuba would eventually convince the Cubans to voluntarily request annexation after they gained full independence. Even if annexation was not achieved, McKinley wanted to help establish a stable government that could resist European interference and would remain friendly to U.S. interests. With input from the McKinley administration, Congress passed the Platt Amendment, which stipulated conditions for U.S. withdrawal from the island; the conditions allowed for a strong American role despite the promise of withdrawal. Cuba became independent in 1902, but the U.S. would re-occupy the island in 1906. McKinley also refused to recognize the native Filipino government of Emilio Aguinaldo, and relations between the United States and the Aguinaldo's supporters deteriorated after the conclusion of the Spanish–American War. McKinley believed that Aguinaldo represented just a small minority of the Filipino populace, and that benevolent American rule would lead to a peaceful occupation. In February 1899, Filipino and American forces clashed at the Battle of Manila, marking the start of the Philippine–American War. The fighting in the Philippines engendered increasingly vocal criticism from the domestic anti-imperialist movement, as did the continued deployment of volunteer regiments. Under General Elwell Stephen Otis, U.S. forces destroyed the rebel Filipino army, but Aguinaldo turned to guerrilla tactics. McKinley sent a commission led by William Howard Taft to establish a civilian government, and McKinley later appointed Taft as the civilian governor of the Philippines. The Filipino insurgency subsided with the capture of Aguinaldo in March 1901, and the U.S. maintained control of the islands until the 1946 Treaty of Manila. After Puerto Rico was devastated by the massive 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane, Secretary of War Root proposed to eliminate all tariff barriers with Puerto Rico. His proposal initiated a serious disagreement between the McKinley administration and Republican leaders in Congress, who were wary of lowering the tariffs on the newly-acquired territories. Rather than relying on Democratic votes to pass a no-tariff bill, McKinley compromised with Republican leaders on a bill that cut tariffs on Puerto Rican goods to a fraction of the rates set by the Dingley Tariff. While considering the tariff bill, the Senate also began hearings on a bill to establish a civil government for Puerto Rico, which the Senate passed in a party-line vote. McKinley signed the Foraker Act into law on April 12, 1900. Under the terms of the bill, all revenue collected from the tariff on Puerto Rican goods would be used for Puerto Rico, and the tariff would cease to function once the government of Puerto Rico established its own taxation system. In the 1901 Insular Cases, the Supreme Court upheld the McKinley administration's policies in the territories acquired in the Spanish–American War, including the establishment of Puerto Rico's government. China Even before peace negotiations began with Spain, McKinley asked Congress to set up a commission to examine trade opportunities in Asia and espoused an \\"Open Door Policy\\", in which all nations would freely trade with China and none would seek to violate that nation's territorial integrity.Yoneyuki Sugita, \\"The Rise of an American Principle in China: A Reinterpretation of the First Open Door Notes toward China.\\" in Sugita, ed., Trans-Pacific relations: America, Europe, and Asia in the twentieth century (2003): 3–20. Secretary of State Hay circulated notes promoting the Open Door to that effect to the European powers. Great Britain favored the idea, but Russia opposed it; France, Germany, Italy and Japan agreed in principle, but only if all the other nations signed on. American soldiers scale the walls of Beijing to relieve the Siege of the International Legations, August 1900 American missionaries were threatened and trade with China became imperiled as the Boxer Rebellion of 1900 menaced foreigners and their property in China.Diana Preston, The Boxer Rebellion: The Dramatic story of China's war on foreigners that shook the world in the summer of 1900 (Bloomsbury, 2000). Americans and other westerners in Peking were besieged and, in cooperation with other western powers, McKinley ordered 5000 troops to the city in June 1900 in the China Relief Expedition. The westerners were rescued the next month, but several Congressional Democrats objected to McKinley dispatching troops without consulting Congress. McKinley's actions set a precedent that led to most of his successors exerting similar independent control over the military. After the rebellion ended, the United States reaffirmed its commitment to the Open Door policy, which became the basis of American policy toward China. It used the cash reparations paid by China to bring Chinese students to Americans schools.Teresa Brawner Bevis, and Christopher J. Lucas, International students in American colleges and universities: A history (Macmillan, 2007) pp. 63–73. Planning the Panama Canal Secretary of State Hay engaged in negotiations with Britain over the possible construction of a canal across Central America. The Clayton–Bulwer Treaty, which the two nations had signed in 1850, prohibited either from establishing exclusive control over a canal there. The Spanish–American War had exposed the difficulty of maintaining a two-ocean navy without a connection closer than Cape Horn, at the southern tip of South America. With American business, humanitarian and military interests even more involved in Asia following the Spanish–American War, a canal seemed more essential than ever, and McKinley pressed for a renegotiation of the treaty. The British, who were distracted by the ongoing Second Boer War, agreed to negotiate a new treaty. Hay and the British ambassador, Julian Pauncefote, agreed that the United States could control a future canal, provided that it was open to all shipping and not fortified. McKinley was satisfied with the terms, but the Senate rejected them, demanding that the United States be allowed to fortify the canal. Hay was embarrassed by the rebuff and offered his resignation, but McKinley refused it and ordered him to continue negotiations to achieve the Senate's demands. He was successful, and a new treaty was drafted and approved, but not before McKinley's assassination in 1901. McKinley also appointed the Isthmian Canal Commission, which would eventually play a large role in selecting Panama over Nicaragua as the site of the Central American canal. The Panama Canal would eventually be completed in 1914.John Taliaferro, All the Great Prizes: The Life of John Hay, from Lincoln to Roosevelt (Simon and Schuster, 2013). Election of 1900 Bryan by a comfortable margin. Republicans were generally successful in state and local elections around the country in 1899, making McKinley optimistic about his chances at re-election heading into 1900. With McKinley widely popular in the Republican Party, his renomination at the 1900 Republican National Convention was assured, but the identity of his running mate was unclear due to the death of Vice President Hobart in 1899. The president personally favored Secretary of War Elihu Root or former Secretary of the Interior Cornelius Newton Bliss for the position, while Governor Theodore Roosevelt, Secretary of the Navy John Long, Seth Low, Ambassador Andrew Dickson White, Senator William Allison, and Congressman Jonathan P. Dolliver of Iowa also stood out as potential running mates. When the convention began in Philadelphia in June 1900, none of the potential running mates had overwhelming support, but Roosevelt had the broadest range of support from around the country. McKinley remained uncommitted in public, but Hanna was firmly opposed to the New York governor. Hanna's stance was undermined by the efforts of political boss and New York Senator Thomas Platt, who, disliking Roosevelt's reform agenda, sought to sideline the governor by making him vice president. On June 21, McKinley was unanimously renominated and, with Hanna's reluctant acquiescence, Roosevelt was nominated for vice president on the first ballot. The Democratic convention convened the next month in Kansas City and nominated William Jennings Bryan, setting up a rematch of the 1896 contest. 1900 electoral vote results. The candidates were the same, but the issues of the campaign had shifted: free silver was still a question that animated many voters, but the Republicans focused on victory in war and prosperity at home as issues they believed favored their party. Democrats knew the war had been popular, even if the imperialism issue was less sure, so they focused on the issue of trusts and corporate power, painting McKinley as the servant of capital and big business. As in 1896, Bryan embarked on a speaking tour around the country while McKinley stayed at home. Bryan's campaign to unseat McKinley faced several challenges, including the general prosperity of the country and factionalism within the Democratic Party. Roosevelt emerged as the Republican campaign's primary speaker and Hanna helped the cause by settling a coal miners' strike in Pennsylvania. Bryan's campaigning failed to excite the voters as it had in 1896, and observers expected McKinley to be re-elected easily. On November 6, 1900, McKinley won the largest victory for any Republican since 1872. Bryan carried only four states outside the Solid South, and even lost his home state of Nebraska. The reasons for the turnabout in Nebraska included prosperity, the collapse of the Populist Party, the intensive Republican campaign in the state, and Bryan's neglect of his base.John W. Bailey, Jr., \\"The Presidential Election of 1900 in Nebraska: McKinley Over Bryan.\\" Nebraska History 54#4 (1973): 560–584. Nationwide, turnout fell from 78.3 percent to 71.6 percent. In the concurrent congressional elections, Republicans kept control of both houses of Congress. Assassination McKinley entering the Temple of Music on September 6, 1901. Artist's conception of the shooting of McKinley The president's personal secretary, George Cortelyou, became concerned with the president's security after several assassinations by anarchists in Europe, including the assassination of King Umberto I of Italy in 1900. Cortelyou twice tried to remove a public reception from the president's visit to the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York in September 1901, but McKinley refused to cancel the appearance, as he enjoyed meeting with the public. On September 5, the president delivered his address at the Pan-American Exposition before a crowd of some 50,000 people. In the speech, which indicated McKinley's second term plans, the president urged reciprocity treaties with other nations to assure American manufacturers access to foreign markets. After the speech, McKinley shook hands with a long line of visitors, which included anarchist Leon Czolgosz. Inspired by a speech delivered by Emma Goldman, Czolgosz had come to the exposition with the intention of assassinating McKinley. Czolgosz concealed a gun in his handkerchief, and, when he reached the head of the line, shot McKinley twice in the abdomen. McKinley was taken to the exposition aid station, where the doctor was unable to locate the second bullet. In the days after the shooting McKinley appeared to improve, and doctors issued increasingly optimistic bulletins. Members of the Cabinet, who had rushed to Buffalo on hearing the news, dispersed; Vice President Roosevelt departed on a camping trip to the Adirondacks. However, unknown to the doctors, the gangrene that would kill McKinley was growing on the walls of his stomach, slowly poisoning his blood. On the morning of September 13, McKinley took a turn for the worse, and at 2:15 a.m. on September 14, President McKinley died. Theodore Roosevelt had rushed back and took the oath of office as president in Buffalo. Czolgosz, put on trial for murder nine days after McKinley's death, was found guilty, sentenced to death on September 26, and executed by electric chair on October 29, 1901. Gould reports, \\"the nation experienced a wave of genuine grief at the news of McKinley's passing.\\" The stock market, faced with sudden uncertainty, suffered a steep decline—almost unnoticed in the mourning. The nation focused its attention on the casket that made its way by train, first to Washington, where it lay in state in the Capitol, and then to McKinley's hometown of Canton. A hundred thousand people passed by the open casket in the Capitol Rotunda, many having waited hours in the rain; in Canton, an equal number did the same at the Stark County Courthouse on September 18. The following day, a funeral service was held at the First Methodist Church; the casket was then sealed and taken to the McKinley house, where relatives paid their final respects. It was then transported to the receiving vault at West Lawn Cemetery in Canton, to await the construction of the memorial to McKinley that was already being planned. Historical reputation McKinley's biographer, H. Wayne Morgan remarks that McKinley died the most beloved president in history. However, the young, enthusiastic Roosevelt quickly captured public attention after his predecessor's death. The new president made little effort to secure the trade reciprocity McKinley had intended to negotiate with other nations. Controversy and public interest surrounded Roosevelt throughout the seven and a half years of his presidency as memories of McKinley faded; by 1920, according to Gould, McKinley's administration was deemed no more than \\"a mediocre prelude to the vigor and energy of Theodore Roosevelt's\\". Beginning in the 1950s, McKinley received more favorable evaluations; nevertheless, in surveys ranking American presidents, he has generally been placed near the middle, often trailing contemporaries such as Hayes and Cleveland. A 2018 poll of the American Political Science Association’s Presidents and Executive Politics section ranked McKinley as the 22nd best president, while a 2017 C-Span poll of historians ranked McKinley as the 16th best president. Morgan suggests that this relatively low ranking is due to a perception among historians that while many decisions during McKinley's presidency profoundly affected the nation's future, he more followed public opinion than led it, and that McKinley's standing has suffered from altered public expectations of the presidency. There has been broad agreement among historians that McKinley's election was at the time of a transition between two political eras, dubbed the Third and Fourth Party Systems. Kenneth F. Warren emphasizes the national commitment to a pro-business, industrial, and modernizing program, represented by McKinley. Historian Daniel P. Klinghard argued that McKinley's personal control of the 1896 campaign gave him the opportunity to reshape the presidency—rather than simply follow the party platform—by representing himself as the voice of the people. However, more recently, as Republican political official Karl Rove exalted McKinley as the agent of sweeping political realignment in the 2000s, some scholars, such as David Mayhew, questioned whether the 1896 election truly represented a realignment, thereby placing in issue whether McKinley deserves credit for it. Historian Michael J. Korzi argued in 2005 that while it is tempting to see McKinley as the key figure in the transition from congressional domination of government to the modern, powerful president, this change was an incremental process through the late 19th and early 20th centuries. A controversial aspect of McKinley's presidency is territorial expansion and the question of imperialism. The U.S. set Cuba free and granted independence to the Philippines in 1946. Puerto Rico remains in an ambiguous status. Hawaii is a state; Guam remains a territory. The territorial expansion of 1898 was the high water mark of American imperialism. Morgan sees that historical discussion as a subset of the debate over the rise of America as a world power; he expects the debate over McKinley's actions to continue indefinitely without resolution, and argues that however one judges McKinley's actions in American expansion, one of his motivations was to change the lives of Filipinos and Cubans for the better.

Harrison, a Republican, took office as the 23rd United States president after defeating Democratic incumbent President Grover Cleveland in the 1888 election. Four years later he was defeated for re-election by Cleveland in the 1892 presidential election. Harrison is the only president to be preceded and succeeded by the same individual. Harrison is also the only president to be the grandson of another president. Harrison and the Republican-controlled 51st United States Congress (derided by opponents as the \\"Billion Dollar Congress\\") enacted the most ambitious domestic agenda of the late-nineteenth century. Hallmarks of his administration include the McKinley Tariff, which imposed historic protective trade rates, and the Sherman Antitrust Act, which empowered the federal government to investigate and prosecute trusts. Due in large part to surplus revenues from the tariffs, federal spending reached one billion dollars for the first time during his term. Harrison facilitated the creation of the National Forests through an amendment to the General Revision Act (1891), and substantially strengthened and modernized the United States Navy. He proposed, in vain, federal education funding as well as voting rights enforcement for African Americans in the South. Harrison's presidency saw the addition of six new states, more than any other president. In foreign affairs, Harrison vigorously promoted American exports, sought tariff reciprocity in Latin America, and worked to increase U.S. influence across the Pacific. Although many historians have praised Harrison's personal integrity and commitment to minority voting rights, scholars and historians generally rank Harrison in the bottom half of U.S. presidents. Nonetheless, Harrison's ambitious domestic policy and assertive foreign policy set a precedent for the more powerful presidencies of the 20th century. Election of 1888 Harrison–Morton campaign poster The initial favorite for the Republican nomination in the 1888 presidential election was James G. Blaine, the party's nominee in the 1884 presidential election. After Blaine wrote several letters denying any interest in the nomination, his supporters divided among other candidates, with John Sherman of Ohio as the leader among them. Others, including Chauncey Depew of New York, Russell Alger of Michigan, and Walter Q. Gresham, a federal appellate judge, also sought the delegates' support at the 1888 Republican National Convention. Blaine did not publicly endorse any of the candidates as a successor; however, on March 1, 1888 he privately wrote that \\"the one man remaining who in my judgment can make the best one is Benjamin Harrison.\\" Harrison represented Indiana in the United States Senate from 1881 to 1887, but lost his 1886 bid for re-election. In February 1888, Harrison announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination, declaring himself a \\"living and rejuvenated Republican.\\" He placed fifth on the first ballot at the 1888 Republican convention, with Sherman in the lead; the next few ballots showed little change. The Blaine supporters shifted their support among different candidates, and when they shifted to Harrison, they found a candidate who could attract the votes of many other delegations. Harrison was nominated as the party's presidential candidate on the eighth ballot, by a count of 544 to 108 votes. Levi P. Morton of New York was chosen as his running mate. 1888 electoral vote results Harrison's opponent in the general election was incumbent President Grover Cleveland. Harrison reprised the traditional front- porch campaign, which had been abandoned by Blaine in 1884. He received visiting delegations to Indianapolis and made ninety plus pronouncements from his home town; Cleveland made only one public campaign appearance. The Republicans campaigned in favor of protective tariffs, turning out protectionist voters in the important industrial states of the North. The election focused on the swing states of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Harrison's home state of Indiana. Harrison and Cleveland split these four states, with Harrison winning in New York and Indiana. Voter turnout was 79.3%, reflecting a large interest in the campaign; nearly eleven million votes were cast. Although he received approximately 90,000 fewer popular votes than Cleveland, Harrison won the electoral vote 233 to 168. This was the third U.S. presidential election in which the winner lost the popular vote. Although Harrison had made no political bargains, his supporters had given many pledges upon his behalf. When Boss Matthew Quay of Pennsylvania heard that Harrison ascribed his narrow victory to Providence, Quay exclaimed that Harrison would never know \\"how close a number of men were compelled to approach...the penitentiary to make him president.\\" In the concurrent congressional elections, the Republicans increased their membership in the House of Representatives by nineteen seats, winning control of the chamber. The party also retained control of the Senate, giving one party unified control of Congress and the presidency for the first time since the 1874 elections. The Republican sweep allowed Harrison to pursue an ambitious legislative agenda in the resulting 51st Congress. Inauguration Inauguration of Benjamin Harrison, March 4, 1889. Cleveland held Harrison's umbrella Harrison was sworn into office on March 4, 1889 by Chief Justice Melville Fuller. At 5' 6\\" tall, he was only slightly taller than James Madison, the shortest president, but much heavier; he was also the fourth (and last) president to sport a full beard. Harrison's inauguration ceremony took place during a rainstorm in Washington D.C. Outgoing President Grover Cleveland attended the ceremony and held an umbrella over Harrison's head as he took the oath of office. Harrison's speech was brief – half as long as that of his grandfather, William Henry Harrison, whose speech holds the record for the longest inaugural address of a U.S. president. In his speech, Benjamin Harrison credited the nation's growth to the influences of education and religion, urged the cotton states and mining territories to attain the industrial proportions of the eastern states, and promised a protective tariff. Concerning commerce, he said, \\"If our great corporations would more scrupulously observe their legal obligations and duties, they would have less call to complain of the limitations of their rights or of interference with their operations.\\" He called for the regulation of trusts, safety laws for railroad employees, aid to education, and funding for internal improvements. Harrison also urged early statehood for the territories and advocated pensions for veterans, a statement that was met with enthusiastic applause. In foreign affairs, Harrison reaffirmed the Monroe Doctrine as a mainstay of foreign policy, while urging modernization of the Navy. He also gave his commitment to international peace through noninterference in the affairs of foreign governments. Administration Harrison's cabinet in 1889. Front (left to right): Harrison, William Windom, John Wanamaker, Redfield Proctor, James G. Blaine; Back (left to right): William H. H. Miller, John W. Noble, Jeremiah M. Rusk, Benjamin F. Tracy. Harrison's cabinet choices alienated pivotal Republican operatives from New York to Pennsylvania to Iowa and prematurely compromised his political power and future. Senator Shelby Cullom's described Harrison's steadfast aversion to the use of federal positions for patronage, stating, \\"I suppose Harrison treated me as well as he did any other Senator; but whenever he did anything for me, it was done so ungraciously that the concession tended to anger rather than please.\\" Harrison began the process of forming a cabinet by choosing to delay the nomination of James G. Blaine as Secretary of State. Harrison felt that Blaine had, as President James Garfield's Secretary of State-designate, held too much power in choosing the personnel of the Garfield administration, and he sought to avoid a similar scenario. Despite this early snub, Blaine and Harrison found common ground on most major policy issues. Blaine played a major role in Harrison's administration, though Harrison made most of the major policy decisions in foreign affairs.Allan Spetter, \\"Harrison and Blaine: Foreign Policy, 1889 1893.\\" Indiana Magazine of History (1969) 65#3:214-27. onlineA.T. Volwiler, \\"Harrison, Blaine, and American Foreign Policy, 1889-1893\\" Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society 79#4 1938) pp. 637-648 onlineSocolofsky & Spetter, p. 111. Blaine served in the cabinet until 1892, when he resigned due to poor health. He was replaced by John W. Foster, an experienced diplomat. For the important position of Secretary of the Treasury, Harrison rejected Thomas C. Platt and Warner Miller, two powerful New York Republicans who fought for control of their state party. He instead selected William Windom, a native Midwesterner who lived in New York and who had served in the same position under Garfield. New York Republicans were also represented in the cabinet by Benjamin F. Tracy, who was appointed Secretary of the Navy. Former Governor Charles Foster of Ohio succeeded Windom upon the latter's death in 1891. Postmaster General John Wanamaker represented Pennsylvania Republicans, many of whom were disappointed that their state party did not receive a more prominent cabinet seat. For the position of Secretary of the Agriculture, which had been established in the waning days of Cleveland's term, Harrison appointed Wisconsin Governor Jeremiah M. Rusk. John Noble, a railroad attorney with a reputation for incorruptibility, became the head of the scandal-plagued Department of the Interior. Redfield Proctor, a native of Vermont who had played a key role in Harrison's nomination, was rewarded with the position of Secretary of War. Proctor resigned in 1891 to take a Senate seat, at which point he was replaced by Stephen B. Elkins. Harrison's close friend and former law partner, William H. H. Miller, became Attorney General. Harrison's normal schedule provided for two full cabinet meetings per week, as well as separate weekly one-on-one meetings with each cabinet member. Judicial appointments Harrison appointed four Supreme Court justices, including David Josiah Brewer. Harrison appointed four justices to the Supreme Court of the United States. The first was David Josiah Brewer, a judge on the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Brewer, the nephew of Associate Justice Field, had previously been considered for a cabinet position. Shortly after Brewer's nomination, Justice Matthews died, creating another vacancy. Harrison had considered Henry Billings Brown, a Michigan judge and admiralty law expert, for the first vacancy and now nominated him for the second. For the third vacancy, which arose in 1892, Harrison nominated George Shiras. Shiras's appointment was somewhat controversial because his age—sixty—was older than usual for a newly appointed Justice, but he won Senate approval. Finally, at the end of his term, Harrison nominated Howell Edmunds Jackson to replace Justice Lamar, who died in January 1893. Harrison knew the incoming Senate would be controlled by Democrats, so he selected Jackson, a respected Tennessee Democrat with whom he was friendly, to ensure his nominee would not be rejected. Jackson's nomination was indeed successful, but he died after only two years on the Court. The other Justices appointed by Harrison served past 1900, with Brewer the last to leave the Court, doing so upon his death in 1910. Harrison signed the Judiciary Act of 1891, which abolished the United States circuit courts and created the United States courts of appeal. The act ended the practice of Supreme Court Justices \\"riding circuit.\\" The end of that custom combined with the creation of permanent intermediate appellate courts significantly reduced the workload faced by the Supreme Court. Harrison appointed ten judges to the courts of appeal, two judges to the circuit courts, and 26 judges to the district courts. Because Harrison was in office when Congress eliminated the circuit courts in favor of the courts of appeals, he and Grover Cleveland were the only two presidents to have appointed judges to both bodies. States admitted to the Union More states were admitted during Harrison's presidency than any other. When Harrison took office, no new states had been admitted to the Union in more than a decade, owing to Congressional Democrats' reluctance to admit states that they believed would send Republican members. Seeking to bolster the party's majorities in the Senate, Republicans pushed bills admitting new states through the lame duck session of the 50th Congress. North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Washington all became states in November 1889. The following July, Idaho and Wyoming were also admitted. These states collectively sent twelve Republican senators to the 51st Congress. Antitrust law Senator John Sherman worked closely with Harrison, writing bills regulating monopolies and monetary policy. Members of both parties were concerned with the growth and power of trusts, which were business arrangements in which several competing companies combined to form one jointly-managed operation. Since the founding of Standard Oil in 1879, trusts created monopolies in several areas of production, including steel, sugar, whiskey, and tobacco. The Harrison administration worked with congressional leaders to propose and pass the Sherman Antitrust Act, one of the first major acts of the 51st United States Congress. The act specified that every \\"combination in the form of trust...in restraint of trade or commerce...is hereby declared to be illegal.\\" Along with the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, the Sherman Act represented one of the first major federal steps taken by the federal government to regulate the economy. Harrison approved of the law and its intent, but his administration was not particularly vigorous in enforcing it. The Department of Justice was generally too understaffed to pursue complex antitrust cases, and enforcement was further hampered by the vague language of the act and narrow interpretation of judges. Despite these hindrances, the government successfully concluded one case during Harrison's time in office (against a Tennessee coal company), and initiated several other cases against trusts. The relatively limited enforcement powers and the Supreme Court's narrow interpretation of the law would eventually inspire passage of the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914. Tariff Tariffs accounted for 60 percent of federal revenue in 1889, and were a major source of political debate in the Gilded Age. Along with a stable currency, high tariffs were the central aspect of Harrison's economic policy, since he believed that they protected domestic manufacturing jobs against cheap, imported goods. The high tariff rates had created a surplus of money in the Treasury, which led many Democrats, as well as the growing Populist movement, to call for lowering them. Most Republicans, however, preferred to spend the budget surplus on internal improvements and eliminate some internal taxes. They saw their victory in the 1888 election as a mandate to raise tariff rates. Harrison took an active role in the tariff debate, hosting dinner parties in which he would cajole members of Congress for their support of a new tariff bill. Representative William McKinley and Senator Nelson W. Aldrich introduced the McKinley Tariff, which would raise the tariff and make some rates intentionally prohibitive so as to discourage imports. At Secretary of State James Blaine's urging, Harrison attempted to make the tariff by adding reciprocity provisions, which would allow the president to reduce rates when other countries reduced their own tariffs on American exports. The reciprocity features of the bill delegated an unusually high amount of power to the president for the time, as the president was granted the power to unilaterally modify tariff rates. The tariff was removed from imported raw sugar, and sugar growers in the United States were given a two cent per pound subsidy on their production. Congress passed the bill after Republican leaders won the votes of Western senators through passage of the Sherman Antitrust Act and other concessions, and Harrison signed the McKinley Tariff into law in October 1890. The Harrison administration negotiated more than a dozen reciprocity agreements with European and Latin American nations in an attempt to expand U.S. trade. Even with the reductions and reciprocity, the McKinley Tariff enacted the highest average rate in American history, and the spending associated with it contributed to the reputation of the \\"Billion-Dollar Congress\\". Currency One of the most volatile questions of the 1880s was whether the currency should be backed by gold and silver, or by gold alone. Owing to worldwide deflation in the late 19th century, a strict gold standard had resulted in reduction of incomes without the equivalent reduction in debts, pushing debtors and the poor to call for silver coinage as an inflationary measure. Because silver was worth less than its legal equivalent in gold, taxpayers paid their government bills in silver, while international creditors demanded payment in gold, resulting in a depletion of the nation's gold supply. The issue cut across party lines, with western Republicans and southern Democrats joining together in the call for the free coinage of silver, and both parties' representatives in the northeast holding firm for the gold standard. The silver coinage issue had not been much discussed in the 1888 campaign. Harrison attempted to steer a middle course between the two positions, advocating a free coinage of silver, but at its own value, not at a fixed ratio to gold. Congress did not adopt Harrison's proposal, but in July 1890, Senator Sherman won passage of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act. The Sherman Silver Purchase Act increased the amount of silver the government was required to purchase on a recurrent monthly basis to 4.5 million ounces. Believing that the bill would end the controversy over silver, Harrison signed the bill into law. The effect of the bill, however, was the increased depletion of the nation's gold supply, a problem that would persist until after Harrison left office. The bill and the silver debate also split the Republican Party, leading to the rise of the Silver Republicans, an influential bloc of Western Congressmen who backed the free coinage of silver. Many of these Silver Republicans would later join the Democratic Party. Civil service reform and pensions Political football Civil service reform was a prominent issue following Harrison's election. Harrison had campaigned as a supporter of the merit system, as opposed to the spoils system. Although the passage of the 1883 Pendleton Act had decreased the role of patronage in assigning government positions, Harrison spent much of his first months in office deciding on political appointments. Congress was severely divided on civil service reform and Harrison was reluctant to address the issue for fear of alienating either side. The issue became a political football of the time and was immortalized in a cartoon captioned \\"What can I do when both parties insist on kicking?\\" Harrison appointed Theodore Roosevelt and Hugh Smith Thompson, both reformers, to the Civil Service Commission, but otherwise did little to further the reform cause. Harrison largely ignored Roosevelt, who frequently called for an expansion of the merit system and complained about the administration of Postmaster General Wanamaker. Benjamin Harrison and the Congress are portrayed as a \\"Billion-Dollar Congress,\\" wasting the surplus in this cartoon from Puck. Harrison's solution to the growing surplus in the federal treasury was to increase pensions for Civil War veterans, the great majority of whom were Republicans. He presided over the enactment of the Dependent and Disability Pension Act, a cause he had championed while in Congress. In addition to providing pensions to disabled Civil War veterans (regardless of the cause of their disability), the act depleted some of the troublesome federal budget surplus. Pension expenditures reached $135 million under Harrison, the largest expenditure of its kind to that point in American history, a problem exacerbated by Pension Bureau commissioner James R. Tanner's expansive interpretation of the pension laws. An investigation into the Pension Bureau by Secretary of the Interior Noble found evidence of lavish and illegal handouts under Tanner. Harrison, who privately believed that appointing Tanner had been a mistake due to his apparent loose management style and tongue, asked Tanner to resign and replaced him with Green B. Raum. Raum was also accused of accepting loan payments in return for expediting pension cases, but Harrison, having accepted a dissenting Congressional Republican investigation report that exonerated Raum, kept him in office for the rest of his administration. Civil rights Harrison with Secretary Blaine and Representative Henry Cabot Lodge off the coast of Maine, 1889 In violation of the Fifteenth Amendment, many Southern states denied African- Americans the right to vote. Convinced that the \\"lily-white policy\\" of attempting to attract white Southerners to the Republican Party had failed, and believing that the disenfranchisement of African-American voters was immoral, Harrison endorsed the Federal Elections Bill. The bill, written by Representative Henry Cabot Lodge and Senator George Frisbie Hoar, would have provided federal oversight over elections for the U.S. House of Representatives. Southern opponents of the bill labeled it the \\"Force Bill,\\" claiming that it would allow the U.S. Army to enforce voting rights, although the law did not contain such a provision. The bill passed the House in July 1890 on a largely party-line vote, but a vote on the bill was delayed in the Senate after Republican leaders chose to focus on the tariff and other priorities. In January 1891, the Senate voted 35-34 to table consideration of the Federal Elections Bill in favor of an unrelated bill backed by the Silver Republicans, and the bill never passed. While many Republicans had supported the Federal Elections Bill, it faced opposition from city-machine party bosses who feared oversight in their own wards; other Republicans were willing to sacrifice the bill to focus on other priorities. The bill represented the last significant federal attempt to protect African-American civil rights until the 1930s, and its failure allowed Southern states to pass Jim Crow laws, resulting in the near-complete disenfranchisement of Southern blacks. Following the failure to pass the bill, Harrison continued to speak in favor of African American civil rights in addresses to Congress. Attorney General Miller conducted prosecutions for violation of voting rights in the South, but white juries often refused to convict or indict violators. He argued that if the states have authority over civil rights, then \\"we have a right to ask whether they are at work upon it.\\" Harrison also supported a bill proposed by Senator Henry W. Blair, which would have granted federal funding to schools regardless of the students' races. Though similar bills had garnered strong Republican support during the 1880s, Blair's bill was defeated in the Senate in 1890 after several Republicans voted against it. Harrison also endorsed an unsuccessful constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court's holding in the Civil Rights Cases, which had declared much of the Civil Rights Act of 1875 unconstitutional, but no action was taken on such an amendment. 1890 midterm elections By the end of the 51st Congress, Harrison and the Republican-controlled allies had passed one of the most ambitious peacetime domestic legislative programs in U.S. history, but the results of the 1890 elections brought the pace of legislation to a sudden halt. Republicans lost almost 100 seats in the House of Representatives, and Democrat Charles Frederick Crisp replaced Thomas Brackett Reed as Speaker of the House. However, Republicans defended their Senate majority. The 1890 elections also saw the rise of the Populist Party, a third party consisting of farmers in the South and Midwest. The Populists emerged from the Farmers' Alliance, the Knights of Labor, and other agrarian reform movements. The party favored bimetallism, the restoration of the Greenback, the nationalization of telegraphs and railroads, tax reform, the abolition of national banks, and other policies. The party's newfound popularity was driven in part by opposition to the McKinley Tariff, which many regarded as benefiting industrialists at the expense of other groups. Many Populists in the Midwest left the Republican Party, while in the South, Populist-aligned candidates generally remained part of the Democratic Party. The split of the Republican vote allowed for the rise of Democrats in the Midwest, including future presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan of Nebraska. National forests In March 1891 Congress enacted and Harrison signed the Land Revision Act of 1891. This legislation resulted from a bipartisan desire to initiate reclamation of surplus lands that had been, up to that point, granted from the public domain, for potential settlement or use by railroad syndicates. As the law's drafting was finalized, Section 24 was added at the behest of Harrison by his Secretary of the Interior John Noble, which read as follows: > That the President of the United States may, from time to time, set apart > and reserve, in any State or Territory having public land bearing forests, > in any part of the public lands wholly or in part covered with timber or > undergrowth, whether of commercial value or not, as public reservations, and > the President shall, by public proclamation, declare the establishment of > such reservations and the limits thereof. Within a month of the enactment of this law Harrison authorized the first forest reserve, to be located on public domain adjacent to Yellowstone Park, in Wyoming. Other areas were so designated by Harrison, bringing the first forest reservations total to 22 million acres in his term. Harrison was also the first to give a prehistoric Indian Ruin, Casa Grande in Arizona, federal protection. Native American policy During Harrison's administration, the Lakota Sioux, previously confined to reservations in South Dakota, grew restive under the influence of Wovoka, a medicine man, who encouraged them to participate in a spiritual movement called the Ghost Dance. Many in Washington did not understand the predominantly religious nature of the Ghost Dance, and thought it was a militant movement being used to rally Native Americans against the government. On December 29, 1890, troops from the Seventh Cavalry clashed with the Sioux at Wounded Knee. The result was a massacre of at least 146 Sioux, including many women and children; the dead Sioux were buried in a mass grave. In reaction Harrison directed Major General Nelson A. Miles to investigate and ordered 3500 federal troops to South Dakota; the uprising was brought to an end. Wounded Knee is considered the last major American Indian battle in the 19th century. Harrison's general policy on American Indians was to encourage assimilation into white society and, despite the massacre, he believed the policy to have been generally successful. This policy, known as the allotment system and embodied in the Dawes Act, was favored by liberal reformers at the time, but eventually proved detrimental to American Indians as they sold most of their land at low prices to white speculators. Soon after taking office, Harrison signed an appropriations bill that opened parts of Indian Territory to white settlement. The territory had been established earlier in the 19th century for the resettlement of the \\"Five Civilized Tribes,\\" and portions of the territory known as the Unassigned Lands had not yet been granted to any tribe. In the Land Rush of 1889, 50,000 settlers moved into the Unassigned Lands to establish land claims. In the 1890 Oklahoma Organic Act, Oklahoma Territory was created out of the western half of Indian Territory. Technology and military modernization The , America's first battleship, built in 1892 During Harrison's time in office, the United States was continuing to experience advances in science and technology, and Harrison was the earliest president whose voice is known to be preserved. That was originally made on a wax phonograph cylinder in 1889 by Gianni Bettini. Harrison also had electricity installed in the White House for the first time by Edison General Electric Company, but he and his wife would not touch the light switches for fear of electrocution and would often go to sleep with the lights on. The United States Navy fell into obsolescence following the Civil War, though reform and expansion had begun under President Chester A. Arthur. When Harrison took office there were only two commissioned warships in the Navy. In his inaugural address he said, \\"construction of a sufficient number of warships and their necessary armaments should progress as rapidly as is consistent with care and perfection.\\" Harrison's support for naval expansion was aided and encouraged by several naval officers, who argued that the navy would be useful for protecting American trade projecting American power. In 1890, Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan published The Influence of Sea Power upon History, an influential work of naval strategy that called for naval expansion; Harrison strongly endorsed it, and Mahan was restored to his position of President of the Naval War College. Secretary of the Navy Tracy spearheaded the rapid construction of vessels, and within a year congressional approval was obtained for building of the warships , , and . By 1898, with the help of the Carnegie Corporation, no less than ten modern warships, including steel hulls and greater displacements and armaments, had transformed the United States into a legitimate naval power. Seven of these had begun during the Harrison term. The United States Army had also been largely neglected since the Civil War, despite the continuing American Indian Wars. When Harrison took office, there were roughly 28,000 officers and enlisted men, and much of the equipment was inferior to that of European armies. Secretary of War Proctor sought to institute several reforms, including an improved diet and the granting of furloughs, resulting in a decline of the desertion rate. Promotions for officers began to be granted based on the branch of service rather than on a regimental basis, and those subject to promotion were required to pass examinations. The Harrison administration also re-established the position of United States Assistant Secretary of War to serve as the second-ranking member of the War Department. Harrison's reform efforts halved the desertion rate, but otherwise the army remained in largely the same state at the end of his tenure. Standardization of place names By executive order, Harrison established the Board on Geographical Names in 1890. The board was tasked with standardizing the spelling of the names of communities and municipalities within the United States; most towns with apostrophes or plurals as part of their names were rewritten as singular (e.g. Weston's Mills became Weston Mills)State and Union: Former resident says 'It was Weston Mills' and Westons Mills: ‘The way it should be’.

Foreign policy Harrison appreciated the forces of nationalism and imperialism which were inevitably pulling the United States onward into playing a more important part in world affairs as it grew rapidly in financial and economic prowess. While the ineffective diplomatic corps was still mired in patronage, the rapidly growing consular service vigorously promoted commerce abroad.Milton Plesur, \\"America Looking Outward: The Years From Hayes to Harrison.\\" The Historian 22.3 (1960): 280-295. Online In a speech in 1891, Harrison proclaimed that the United States was in a \\"new epoch\\" of trade and that the expanding navy would protect oceanic shipping and increase American influence and prestige abroad. The increasing importance of the United States in world affairs was reflected in the act of Congress in 1893 which raised the rank of the most important diplomatic representatives abroad from minister plenipotentiary to ambassador. Latin America  Harrison and Blaine agreed on an ambitious foreign policy that emphasized commercial reciprocity with other nations. Their goal was to replace Britain as the dominant commercial power in Latin America. The First International Conference of American States met in Washington in 1889; Harrison set an aggressive agenda including customs and currency integration and named a bipartisan conference delegation led by John B. Henderson and Andrew Carnegie. Though the conference failed to achieve any diplomatic breakthrough, it did succeed in establishing an information center that became the Pan American Union. In response to the diplomatic bust, Harrison and Blaine pivoted diplomatically and initiated a crusade for tariff reciprocity with Latin American nations; the Harrison administration concluded eight reciprocity treaties among these countries. The Harrison administration did not pursue reciprocity with Canada, as Harrison and Blaine believed that Canada was an integral part of the British economic bloc and could never be integrated into a trade system dominated by the U.S.Allan B. Spetter, \\"Harrison and Blaine: No Reciprocity for Canada.\\" Canadian Review of American Studies 12.2 (1981): 143-156. On another front, Harrison sent Frederick Douglass as ambassador to Haiti, but failed in his attempts to establish a naval base there. Samoa By 1889, the United States, Great Britain and Germany were locked in an escalating dispute over control of the Samoan Islands in the Pacific. The dispute had started in 1887 when the Germans tried to establish control over the island chain and President Cleveland responded by sending three naval vessels to defend the Samoan government. American and German warships faced off but all were badly damaged by the 1889 Apia cyclone of March 15–17, 1889.Noah Andre Trudeau, \\"'An Appalling Calamity'--In the teeth of the Great Samoan Typhoon of 1889, a standoff between the German and US navies suddenly didn't matter.\\" Naval History Magazine 25.2 (2011): 54-59. Seeking to improve relations with Britain and the United States, German Chancellor Otto Von Bismarck convened a conference in Berlin. Delegates from the three countries agreed to the Treaty of Berlin, which established a three- power protectorate in Samoa. Historian George H. Ryden argues that Harrison played a key role in determining the status of this Pacific outpost by taking a firm stand on every aspect of Samoa conference negotiations; this included selection of the local ruler, refusal to allow an indemnity for Germany, as well as the establishment of the three-power protectorate, a first for the U.S.George Herbert Ryden, The Foreign Policy of the United States in Relation to Samoa (1933).

After Canada claimed fishing and sealing rights around many of the Aleutian Islands, the U.S. Navy seized several Canadian ships. In 1891, the administration began negotiations with the British that would eventually lead to a compromise over fishing rights after international arbitration, with the British government paying compensation in 1898. USS Baltimore spawned the 1891 Chilean crisis. In 1891, a new diplomatic crisis, known as the Baltimore Crisis, emerged in Chile. The American minister to Chile, Patrick Egan, granted asylum to Chileans who were seeking refuge during the 1891 Chilean Civil War. Egan, previously a militant Irish immigrant to the U.S., was motivated by a personal desire to thwart Great Britain's influence in Chile. The crisis began in earnest when sailors from the took shore leave in Valparaiso and a fight ensued, resulting in the deaths of two American sailors and the arrest of three dozen others. The Baltimore's captain, Winfield Schley, based on the nature of the sailors' wounds, insisted the sailors had been bayonet-attacked by Chilean police without provocation. With Blaine incapacitated, Harrison drafted a demand for reparations. The Chilean Minister of Foreign Affairs replied that Harrison's message was \\"erroneous or deliberately incorrect,\\" and said that the Chilean government was treating the affair the same as any other criminal matter. Tensions increased to the brink of war – Harrison threatened to break off diplomatic relations unless the United States received a suitable apology, and said the situation required \\"grave and patriotic consideration\\". The president also remarked, \\"If the dignity as well as the prestige and influence of the United States are not to be wholly sacrificed, we must protect those who in foreign ports display the flag or wear the colors.\\" A recuperated Blaine made brief conciliatory overtures to the Chilean government which had no support in the administration; he then reversed course and joined the chorus for unconditional concessions and apology by the Chileans. The Chileans ultimately obliged, and war was averted. Theodore Roosevelt later applauded Harrison for his use of the \\"big stick\\" in the matter. Annexation of Hawaii The United States had reached a reciprocity treaty with Hawaii in 1875, and since had then had blocked Japanese and British efforts to take control of the Hawaii. Harrison sought to annex the country, which held a strategic position in the Pacific Ocean, and hosted a growing sugar business controlled by American settlers.Julius W. Pratt, \\"The Hawaiian Revolution: A Re-Interpretation.\\" Pacific Historical Review 1.3 (1932): 273-294. onlineGeorge W. Baker, \\"Benjamin Harrison and Hawaiian Annexation: A Reinterpretation.\\" Pacific Historical Review 33.3 (1964): 295-309. OnlineLaFeber, The New Empire (1963) Following a coup d'état against Queen Liliuokalani, the new government of Hawaii led by Sanford Dole petitioned for annexation by the United States. Harrison was interested in expanding American influence in Hawaii and in establishing a naval base at Pearl Harbor, but had not previously expressed an opinion on annexing the islands. The United States consul in Hawaii recognized the new Hawaiian government on February 1, 1893 and forwarded their proposal of annexation to Washington. With just one month left before leaving office, the administration signed the annexation treaty on February 14 and submitted it to the Senate the next day. The Senate failed to act, and President Cleveland withdrew the treaty shortly after taking office later that year. Vacations and travel The Harrisons made many trips out of the capital, which included speeches at most stops – including Philadelphia, New England, Indianapolis and Chicago. The president typically made his best impression speaking before large audiences, as opposed to more intimate settings. The most notable of his presidential trips, theretofore unequaled, was a five-week tour of the west in the spring of 1891, aboard a lavishly outfitted train. Harrison enjoyed a number of short trips out of the capital—usually for hunting—to nearby Virginia or Maryland. During the hot Washington summers, the Harrisons took refuge in Deer Park, Maryland and Cape May Point, New Jersey. In 1890, Postmaster General (and successful businessman) Wanamaker joined with other Philadelphia devotees of the Harrisons and made a gift to them of a summer cottage at Cape May. Harrison, though appreciative, was uncomfortable with the appearance of impropriety; a month later, he paid Wanamaker $10,000 as reimbursement to the donors. Nevertheless, Harrison's opponents made the gift the subject of national ridicule, and Mrs. Harrison and the president were vigorously criticized. Election of 1892 By 1892, the treasury surplus had evaporated and the nation's economic health was worsening – precursors to the eventual Panic of 1893. Although Harrison had cooperated with Congressional Republicans on legislation, several party leaders withdrew their support due to discontent over Harrison's appointments. Matthew Quay, Thomas Platt, and Thomas Reed quietly organized the Grievance Committee, the ambition of which was to initiate a dump-Harrison offensive. Many of Harrison's detractors persisted in pushing for an incapacitated Blaine, though he announced that he was not a candidate in February 1892. Some party leaders still hoped to draft Blaine into running, and speculation increased when he resigned at the 11th hour as Secretary of State in June. At the convention in Minneapolis, Harrison prevailed on the first ballot, but encountered significant opposition, with Blaine and William McKinley both receiving votes on the lone ballot. At the convention, Vice President Morton was dropped from the ticket, and was replaced by Ambassador Whitelaw Reid. The Democrats renominated former President Cleveland, making the 1892 election a rematch of the one four years earlier. The tariff revisions of the past four years had made imported goods so expensive that many voters had begun to favor lowering the tariff. The Populist Party held its first national convention in July, nominating a presidential ticket led by former Congressman James Weaver of Iowa. The convention adopted the Omaha Platform, which called for free silver, the reintroduction of Greenbacks, a graduated income tax, an eight-hour work day, the direct election of senators, and the nationalization of railroads. Many traditionally Republican Westerners defected to Weaver, but the party failed to galvanize its supporters in the South, with the exception of North Carolina. The effects of the suppression of the Homestead Strike and other strikes split the Republicans, as many Northern laborers defected to the Democratic Party. Cleveland's opposition to high tariffs throughout his career benefited his 1892 campaign, and Democrats attacked Republicans as the party of big business. 1892 electoral vote results Harrison's wife Caroline began a critical struggle with tuberculosis earlier in 1892 and two weeks before the election, on October 25, she died. Her role as First Lady was filled by their daughter, Mary Harrison McKee for the balance of Harrison's presidency. Mrs. Harrison's terminal illness and the fact that both major candidates had served in the White House called for a low key campaign, and resulted in neither of them actively campaigning personally. Cleveland ultimately won the election by 277 electoral votes to Harrison's 145, the most decisive margin in 20 years. Cleveland won 46 percent of the popular vote, beating Harrison by a margin of approximately 375,000 votes. Cleveland swept the four swing states of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Indiana, and also became the first Democrat since the Civil War to carry Wisconsin and Indiana. Weaver garnered just over one million voters and twenty-two electoral votes, with most of his support coming from Western voters. In the 1892 congressional elections, Democrats retained control of the House and won a majority in the Senate. The resulting 53rd United States Congress marked the first time since the Civil War that Democrats held unified control of the presidency and both houses of Congress. Historical reputation Closely scrutinized by Democrats, Harrison's reputation was largely intact when he left the White House. Following the Panic of 1893, Harrison became more popular in retirement. His legacy among historians is scant, and \\"general accounts of his period inaccurately treat Harrison as a cipher\\". However, many recent historians have recognized the importance of the Harrison administration in influencing the foreign policy of the late nineteenth century. Historians have often given Secretary of State Blaine credit for foreign-policy initiatives but historian Charles Calhoun argues that Harrison was more responsible for the success of trade negotiations, the buildup of the steel Navy, overseas expansion, and emphasis on the American role in dominating the hemisphere through the Monroe Doctrine. The major weakness which Calhoun sees was that the public and indeed the grassroots Republican Party was not fully prepared for this onslaught of major activity.Charles Calhoun, Benjamin Harrison (2005).Charles Calhoun, \\"Reimagining the \\"Lost Men\\" of the Gilded Age: Perspectives on the Late Nineteenth Century Presidents\\". Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era (2002) 1#3: 225–257. Nonetheless, the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, signed into law by Harrison, remains in effect over 120 years later.Batten, p. 209 Harrison's support for African American voting rights and education would be the last significant attempts to protect civil rights until the 1930s. Harrison is one of the least well-known presidents among the general public; a 2012 article in New York selected Harrison as the \\"most forgotten president.\\" Polls of historians and political scientists have generally ranked Harrison as a below- average president. A 2018 poll of the American Political Science Association's Presidents and Executive Politics section ranked Harrison as the 32nd best president. A 2017 C-Span poll of historians ranked Harrison as the 30th best president. Historian Allan B. Spetter writes, > Because of his lack of personal passion and the failure of anything truly > eventful, such as a major war, during his administration, Harrison, along > with every other President from the post-Reconstruction era to 1900, has > been assigned to the rankings of mediocrity.

Common functions studied with influence lines include reactions (forces that the structure’s supports must apply for the structure to remain static), shear, moment, and deflection (Deformation) . Influence lines are important in designing beams and trusses used in bridges, crane rails, conveyor belts, floor girders, and other structures where loads will move along their span. The influence lines show where a load will create the maximum effect for any of the functions studied. Influence lines are both scalar and additive. This means that they can be used even when the load that will be applied is not a unit load or if there are multiple loads applied. To find the effect of any non-unit load on a structure, the ordinate results obtained by the influence line are multiplied by the magnitude of the actual load to be applied. The entire influence line can be scaled, or just the maximum and minimum effects experienced along the line. The scaled maximum and minimum are the critical magnitudes that must be designed for in the beam or truss. In cases where multiple loads may be in effect, influence lines for the individual loads may be added together to obtain the total effect felt the structure bears at a given point. When adding the influence lines together, it is necessary to include the appropriate offsets due to the spacing of loads across the structure. For example, a truck load is applied to the structure. Rear axle, B, is three feet behind front axle, A, then the effect of A at x feet along the structure must be added to the effect of B at (x – 3) feet along the structure—not the effect of B at x feet along the structure. Many loads are distributed rather than concentrated. Influence lines can be used with either concentrated or distributed loadings. For a concentrated (or point) load, a unit point load is moved along the structure. For a distributed load of a given width, a unit-distributed load of the same width is moved along the structure, noting that as the load nears the ends and moves off the structure only part of the total load is carried by the structure. The effect of the distributed unit load can also be obtained by integrating the point load’s influence line over the corresponding length of the structures. The Influence lines of determinate structures becomes a mechanism whereas the Influence lines of indeterminate structures become just determinate. Demonstration from Betti's theorem Influence lines are based on Betti's theorem. From there, consider two external force systems, F^P_i and F^Q_i, each one associated with a displacement field whose displacements measured in the force's point of application are represented by d^P_i and d^Q_i. Consider that the F^P_i system represents actual forces applied to the structure, which are in equilibrium. Consider that the F^Q_i system is formed by a single force, F^Q. The displacement field d^Q_i associated with this forced is defined by releasing the structural restraints acting on the point where F^Q is applied and imposing a relative unit displacement that is kinematically admissible in the negative direction, represented as d^Q_1 = -1. From Betti's theorem, we obtain the following result: -F^P_1 + \\\\sum^n_{i=2}F^P_id^Q_i = F^Q\\\\times 0 \\\\iff F^P_1 = \\\\sum^n_{i=2}F^P_id^Q_i Concept When designing a beam or truss, it is necessary to design for the scenarios causing the maximum expected reactions, shears, and moments within the structure members to ensure that no member fails during the life of the structure. When dealing with dead loads (loads that never move, such as the weight of the structure itself), this is relatively easy because the loads are easy to predict and plan for. For live loads (any load that moves during the life of the structure, such as furniture and people), it becomes much harder to predict where the loads will be or how concentrated or distributed they will be throughout the life of the structure. Influence lines graph the response of a beam or truss as a unit load travels across it. The influence line helps designers find where to place a live load in order to calculate the maximum resulting response for each of the following functions: reaction, shear, or moment. The designer can then scale the influence line by the greatest expected load to calculate the maximum response of each function for which the beam or truss must be designed. Influence lines can also be used to find the responses of other functions (such as deflection or axial force) to the applied unit load, but these uses of influence lines are less common. Methods for constructing influence lines There are three methods used for constructing the influence line. The first is to tabulate the influence values for multiple points along the structure, then use those points to create the influence line. The second is to determine the influence-line equations that apply to the structure, thereby solving for all points along the influence line in terms of x, where x is the number of feet from the start of the structure to the point where the unit load is applied. The third method is called the Müller-Breslau's principle. It creates a qualitative influence line. This influence line will still provide the designer with an accurate idea of where the unit load will produce the largest response of a function at the point being studied, but it cannot be used directly to calculate what the magnitude that response will be, whereas the influence lines produced by the first two methods can. Tabulate values To tabulate the influence values with respect to some point A on the structure, a unit load must be placed at various points along the structure. Statics is used to calculate what the value of the function (reaction, shear, or moment) is at point A. Typically an upwards reaction is seen as positive. Shear and moments are given positive or negative values according to the same conventions used for shear and moment diagrams. R. C. Hibbeler states, in his book Structural Analysis, “All statically determinate beams will have influence lines that consist of straight line segments.” Therefore, it is possible to minimize the number of computations by recognizing the points that will cause a change in the slope of the influence line and only calculating the values at those points. The slope of the inflection line can change at supports, mid-spans, and joints. An influence line for a given function, such as a reaction, axial force, shear force, or bending moment, is a graph that shows the variation of that function at any given point on a structure due to the application of a unit load at any point on the structure. An influence line for a function differs from a shear, axial, or bending moment diagram. Influence lines can be generated by independently applying a unit load at several points on a structure and determining the value of the function due to this load, i.e. shear, axial, and moment at the desired location. The calculated values for each function are then plotted where the load was applied and then connected together to generate the influence line for the function. Once the influence values have been tabulated, the influence line for the function at point A can be drawn in terms of x. First, the tabulated values must be located. For the sections in between the tabulated points, interpolation is required. Therefore, straight lines may be drawn to connect the points. Once this is done, the influence line is complete. Influence-line equations It is possible to create equations defining the influence line across the entire span of a structure. This is done by solving for the reaction, shear, or moment at the point A caused by a unit load placed at x feet along the structure instead of a specific distance. This method is similar to the tabulated values method, but rather than obtaining a numeric solution, the outcome is an equation in terms of x. It is important to understanding where the slope of the influence line changes for this method because the influence-line equation will change for each linear section of the influence line. Therefore, the complete equation is a piecewise linear function with a separate influence-line equation for each linear section of the influence line.  Müller-Breslau's Principle According to www.public.iastate.edu, “The Müller-Breslau Principle can be utilized to draw qualitative influence lines, which are directly proportional to the actual influence line.” Instead of moving a unit load along a beam, the Müller-Breslau Principle finds the deflected shape of the beam caused by first releasing the beam at the point being studied, and then applying the function (reaction, shear, or moment) being studied to that point. The principle states that the influence line of a function will have a scaled shape that is the same as the deflected shape of the beam when the beam is acted upon by the function. To understand how the beam deflects under the function, it is necessary to remove the beam’s capacity to resist the function. Below are explanations of how to find the influence lines of a simply supported, rigid beam (such as the one displayed in Figure 1). :* When determining the reaction caused at a support, the support is replaced with a roller, which cannot resist a vertical reaction. Then an upward (positive) reaction is applied to the point where the support was. Since the support has been removed, the beam will rotate upwards, and since the beam is rigid, it will create a triangle with the point at the second support. If the beam extends beyond the second support as a cantilever, a similar triangle will be formed below the cantilevers position. This means that the reaction’s influence line will be a straight, sloping line with a value of zero at the location of the second support. :* When determining the shear caused at some point B along the beam, the beam must be cut and a roller-guide (which is able to resist moments but not shear) must be inserted at point B. Then, by applying a positive shear to that point, it can be seen that the left side will rotate down, but the right side will rotate up. This creates a discontinuous influence line that reaches zero at the supports and whose slope is equal on either side of the discontinuity. If point B is at a support, then the deflection between point B and any other supports will still create a triangle, but if the beam is cantilevered, then the entire cantilevered side will move up or down creating a rectangle. :* When determining the moment caused by at some point B along the beam, a hinge will be placed at point B, releasing it to moments but resisting shear. Then when a positive moment is placed at point B, both sides of the beam will rotate up. This will create a continuous influence line, but the slopes will be equal and opposite on either side of the hinge at point B. Since the beam is simply supported, its end supports (pins) cannot resist moment; therefore, it can be observed that the supports will never experience moments in a static situation regardless of where the load is placed. The Müller-Breslau Principle can only produce qualitative influence lines. This means that engineers can use it to determine where to place a load to incur the maximum of a function, but the magnitude of that maximum cannot be calculated from the influence line. Instead, the engineer must use statics to solve for the functions value in that loading case. Alternate loading cases Multiple loads The simplest loading case is a single point load, but influence lines can also be used to determine responses due to multiple loads and distributed loads. Sometimes it is known that multiple loads will occur at some fixed distance apart. For example, on a bridge the wheels of cars or trucks create point loads that act at relatively standard distances. To calculate the response of a function to all these point loads using an influence line, the results found with the influence line can be scaled for each load, and then the scaled magnitudes can be summed to find the total response that the structure must withstand. The point loads can have different magnitudes themselves, but even if they apply the same force to the structure, it will be necessary to scale them separately because they act at different distances along the structure. For example, if a car's wheels are 10 feet apart, then when the first set is 13 feet onto the bridge, the second set will be only 3 feet onto the bridge. If the first set of wheels is 7 feet onto the bridge, the second set has not yet reached the bridge, and therefore only the first set is placing a load on the bridge. Also, if, between two loads, one of the loads is heavier, the loads must be examined in both loading orders (the larger load on the right and the larger load on the left) to ensure that the maximum load is found. If there are three or more loads, then the number of cases to be examined increases. Distributed loads Many loads do not act as point loads, but instead act over an extended length or area as distributed loads. For example, a tractor with continuous tracks will apply a load distributed over the length of each track. To find the effect of a distributed load, the designer can integrate an influence line, found using a point load, over the affected distance of the structure. For example, if a three-foot-long track acts between 5 feet and 8 feet along a beam, the influence line of that beam must be integrated between 5 and 8 feet. The integration of the influence line gives the effect that would be felt if the distributed load had a unit magnitude. Therefore, after integrating, the designer must still scale the results to get the actual effect of the distributed load. Indeterminate structures While the influence lines of statically determinate structures (as mentioned above) are made up of straight line segments, the same is not true for indeterminate structures. Indeterminate structures are not considered rigid; therefore, the influence lines drawn for them will not be straight lines but rather curves. The methods above can still be used to determine the influence lines for the structure, but the work becomes much more complex as the properties of the beam itself must be taken into consideration.

Hayes began on March 4, 1877, when Rutherford B. Hayes was inaugurated as President of the United States, and ended on March 4, 1881. Hayes became the 19th president, after being awarded the closely contested 1876 presidential election by Republicans in Congress who agreed to the Compromise of 1877. That Compromise promised to pull federal troops out of the South, thus ending Reconstruction. He refused to seek re-election and was succeeded by James A. Garfield, a fellow Republican and ally. In general he was a moderate and a pragmatist. He kept the promise to withdraw the last federal troops from the South, as Democrats took control of the last three Republican states. A paragon of honesty, he sponsored civil service reform, where he challenged the patronage hungry Republican politicians. Though he failed to enact long-term reform, he helped generate public support for the eventual passage of the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act in 1883. The Republican Party in the South grew steadily weaker as his efforts to support the civil rights of blacks in the South were largely stymied by Democrats in Congress. Insisting that maintenance of the gold standard was essential to economic recovery, he opposed Greenbacks (paper money not backed by gold or silver) and vetoed the Bland–Allison Act that called for more silver in the money supply. Congress overrode his veto, but Hayes's monetary policy forged a compromise between inflationists and advocates of hard money. He used federal troops cautiously to avoid violence in the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, one of the largest labor strikes in U.S. history. It marked the end of the economic depression called the \\"Panic of 1873\\". Prosperity marked the rest of his term. His policy toward Native Americans emphasized minimizing fraud. He continued Grant's \\"peace plan\\" and anticipated the assimilationist program of the Dawes Act of 1887. In foreign policy, he was a moderate who took few initiatives. He unsuccessfully opposed the De Lesseps plan for building a Panama Canal, which he thought should be an American only program, Hayes asserted U.S. influence in Latin America and the continuing primacy of the Monroe Doctrine. Polls of historians and political scientists generally rank Hayes as an average president.  Election of 1876   Nomination and general election  Hayes-Wheeler campaign poster With the retirement of President Ulysses S. Grant after two terms, the Republicans had to settle on a new candidate for the 1876 election. Hayes's success as Governor of Ohio elevated him to the top ranks of Republican politicians under consideration for the presidency, alongside James G. Blaine of Maine, Senator Oliver P. Morton of Indiana, and Senator Roscoe Conkling of New York. The Ohio delegation to the 1876 Republican National Convention was united behind Hayes, and Senator John Sherman did all in his power to aid the nomination of his fellow Ohioan. In June 1876, the Republican National Convention assembled in Hayes's hometown of Cincinnati, with Blaine as the favorite. Hayes placed fifth on the first ballot of the convention, behind Blaine, Morton, Secretary of the Treasury Benjamin Bristow, and Conkling. After six ballots, Blaine remained in the lead, but on the seventh ballot, Blaine's adversaries rallied around Hayes, granting him the presidential nomination. For the vice presidency, the convention selected Representative William A. Wheeler, a man about whom Hayes had recently asked, \\"I am ashamed to say: who is Wheeler?\\" Hayes's views were largely in accord with the party platform, which called for equal rights regardless of race or gender, a continuation of Reconstruction, the prohibition of public funding for sectarian schools, and the resumption of specie payments. Hayes's nomination was well received by the press, with even Democratic papers describing Hayes as honest and likable. In a public letter accepting the nomination, Hayes vowed to support civil service reform and pledged to serve for only one term. The Democratic nominee was Samuel J. Tilden, the Governor of New York. Tilden was generally considered to be a formidable adversary and, like Hayes, he had a reputation for honesty. Also, like Hayes, Tilden was a hard-money man and supported civil service reform. In accordance with the custom of the time, the campaign was conducted by surrogates, with Hayes and Tilden remaining in their respective home towns. The poor economic conditions following the Panic of 1873, combined with various Republican scandals, made the party in power unpopular, and Hayes personally believed that he might lose the election. Both candidates focused their attention on the swing states of New York and Indiana, as well as the three Southern states—Louisiana, South Carolina, and Florida—where Reconstruction governments still barely ruled amid recurring political violence. The Republicans emphasized the danger of letting Democrats run the nation so soon after the Civil War, which they claimed had been provoked by southern Democrats. To a lesser extent, they also campaigned on the danger a Democratic administration would pose to the recently won civil rights of Southern blacks. Democrats, for their part, trumpeted Tilden's record of reform and contrasted it with the corruption of the incumbent Grant administration. The election was marred by violence in the South, as Redeemers sought to suppress the black vote.  Post-election dispute  As the returns were tallied on election day, it was clear that the race was close: while Hayes had won much of the North, Tilden had carried most of the South, as well as New York, Indiana, Connecticut, and New Jersey. On November 11, three days after election day, the 19 electoral votes of Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina were still in doubt. Tilden had won states with a collective total of 184 electoral votes, one short of a majority, while Hayes had won states with 166 electoral votes. Republicans and Democrats each claimed victory in the three disputed states, but the results in those states were rendered uncertain because of fraud by both parties. To further complicate matters, one of the three electors from Oregon (a state Hayes had won) was disqualified, reducing Hayes's total to 165, and raising the disputed votes to 20. If Tilden was awarded just one of the disputed electoral votes, he would become president, while a Hayes victory would require him to win all twenty of the disputed votes. With no clear victor in the election, the possibility of mass disorder hung over a country that remained deeply divided in the aftermath of the Civil War. Results of the 1876 election, with states won by Hayes in red, and those won by Tilden in blue There was considerable debate about which person or house of Congress was authorized to decide between the competing slates of electors, with the Republican Senate and the Democratic House each claiming priority. By January 1877, with the question still unresolved, Congress and President Grant agreed to submit the matter to a bipartisan Electoral Commission, which would be authorized to determine the fate of the disputed electoral votes. The Commission was to be made up of five representatives, five senators, and five Supreme Court justices. To ensure partisan balance, there would be seven Democrats and seven Republicans, with Justice David Davis, an independent respected by both parties, as the fifteenth member. The balance was upset when Democrats in the Illinois legislature elected Davis to the Senate, hoping to sway his vote; Davis disappointed Democrats by subsequently refusing to serve on the Electoral Commission As all of the remaining Justices were Republicans, Justice Joseph P. Bradley, believed to be the most independent-minded of them, was selected to take Davis's place on the Commission. The Commission met in February and the eight Republicans voted to award all 20 electoral votes to Hayes. Despite the Commission's holding, Democrats could still block certification of the election by refusing to convene the House. As the March 4 inauguration day neared, Republican and Democratic Congressional leaders met at Wormley's Hotel in Washington and negotiated a compromise settlement. Republicans promised concessions in exchange for Democratic acquiescence in the Committee's decision. The primary concessions Hayes promised were the withdrawal of federal troops from the South and an acceptance of the election of Democratic governments in the remaining \\"unredeemed\\" states of the South. Democrats accepted the compromise, and Hayes was certified as the winner of the election on March 2.  Inauguration  Because March 4, 1877 fell on a Sunday, Hayes took the oath of office privately on Saturday, March 3, in the Red Room of the White House, the first president to do so in the Executive Mansion. He took the oath publicly on the following Monday on the East Portico of the United States Capitol. In his inaugural address, Hayes attempted to soothe the passions of the past few months, saying that \\"he serves his party best who serves his country best\\". He pledged to support \\"wise, honest, and peaceful local self-government\\" in the South, as well as reform of the civil service and a full return to the gold standard. Despite his message of conciliation, many Democrats never considered Hayes's election legitimate and referred to him as \\"Rutherfraud\\" or \\"His Fraudulency\\" for the next four years. Administration Cabinet Hayes's cabinet in 1877 In choosing the members of his cabinet, Hayes spurned Radical Republicans in favor of moderates, and also disregarded anyone whom he considered a potential presidential contender. He chose William M. Evarts, who had defended President Andrew Johnson against impeachment, as Secretary of State. George W. McCrary, who had helped establish the Electoral Commission of 1877, became Secretary of War. Carl Schurz, who had supported the Liberal Republican ticket in 1872, was selected as Secretary of the Interior. In an effort to reach out to Southern moderates, Hayes selected David M. Key, a former Confederate soldier, to serve as Postmaster General. Senator John Sherman, a close ally and currency issues expert, became Secretary of the Treasury, while Richard W. Thompson was selected as Secretary of the Navy to reward Oliver P. Morton for the latter's support at the 1876 Republican National Convention. The Schurz and Evarts nominations alienated both the Stalwart and the Half-Breed factions of the Republican Party, but Hayes's initial cabinet selections won confirmation in the Senate with the help of some Southern Senators.  Lemonade Lucy and the dry White House  Hayes and his wife Lucy were known for their policy of keeping an alcohol-free White House, giving rise to her nickname \\"Lemonade Lucy.\\" The first reception at the Hayes White House included wine, but Hayes was dismayed at drunken behavior at receptions hosted by ambassadors around Washington. After the first reception, alcohol was not served again in the Hayes White House. Critics charged Hayes with parsimony, but Hayes spent more money (which came out of his personal budget) after the ban, ordering that any savings from eliminating alcohol be used on more lavish entertainment. His temperance policy also paid political dividends, strengthening his support among Protestant ministers. Although Secretary Evarts quipped that at the White House dinners, \\"water flowed like wine,\\" the policy was a success in convincing prohibitionists to vote Republican.  Judicial appointments  Stanley Matthews's confirmation to the Supreme Court was more difficult than Hayes expected. Hayes appointed two associate justices to the Supreme Court. The first Supreme Court vacancy arose after David Davis resigned during the election controversy of 1876. On taking office, Hayes filled the vacancy caused by Davis's resignation by appointing John Marshall Harlan, a close ally of Benjamin Bristow. Hayes submitted the nomination in October 1877, but the nomination aroused some dissent in the Senate because of Harlan's limited experience in public office. Harlan was nonetheless confirmed and served on the court for thirty-four years, in which he voted (usually in the minority) for an aggressive enforcement of civil rights laws. In 1880, a second seat became vacant upon the resignation of Justice William Strong. Hayes nominated William Burnham Woods, a carpetbagger Republican circuit court judge from Alabama. Woods served six years on the Court, ultimately proving a disappointment to Hayes as he interpreted the Constitution in a manner more similar to that of Southern Democrats than to Hayes's own preferences. Hayes attempted, unsuccessfully, to fill a third vacancy in 1881. Justice Noah Haynes Swayne resigned with the expectation that Hayes would fill his seat by appointing Stanley Matthews, who was a friend of both men. Many Senators objected to the appointment, believing that Matthews was too close to corporate and railroad interests, especially those of Jay Gould. The Senate adjourned without voting on the nomination, but newly-elected President James A. Garfield re-submitted Matthews's nomination to the Senate, and Matthews was confirmed by a one vote margin. Matthews served for eight years until his death in 1889. His opinion in Yick Wo v. Hopkins in 1886 advanced his and Hayes' views on the protection of ethnic minorities' rights. In addition to his Supreme Court appointments, Hayes appointed four judges to the United States circuit courts and sixteen judges to the United States district courts.  End of Reconstruction  Withdrawal from the South When Hayes assumed office, only two Reconstruction governments remained, in South Carolina and Louisiana. Hayes had been a firm supporter of Republican Reconstruction policies throughout his political career, but the first major act of his presidency was to end Reconstruction and return the South to \\"home rule.\\" In South Carolina, Hayes withdrew federal soldiers on April 10, 1877, after Governor Wade Hampton III promised to respect the civil rights of African Americans. In Louisiana, Hayes appointed a commission to mediate between the rival governments of Republican Stephen B. Packard and Democrat Francis T. Nicholls. The commission chose to support Nicholls's government, and Hayes ended Reconstruction in Louisiana, and the country as a whole, on April 20, 1877. Some Republicans, such as Blaine, strongly criticized the end of Reconstruction. However, even without the conditions of the disputed 1876 election, Hayes would have been hard-pressed to continue the policies of his predecessors. The House of Representatives in the 45th Congress was controlled by the Democratic Party, and the Democrats refused to appropriate enough funds for the army to continue to garrison the South. Even among Republicans, devotion to continued military Reconstruction was fading in the face of persistent Southern insurgency and violence. Voting Rights Democrats consolidated their control in the South in the 1878 mid-term elections, creating a voting bloc known as the Solid South. Just three of the 73 Representatives elected by the former Confederate states were members of the Republican Party. Democrats also took control of the Senate in the 1878 elections, and the new Democratic Congress immediately sought to strip away the remaining federal influence in the South. The Democratic Congress passed an army appropriations bill in 1879 with a rider that repealed the Enforcement Acts, which had been used to suppress the Ku Klux Klan. Those acts, passed during Reconstruction, made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because of his race. Hayes was determined to preserve the law protecting black voters, and he vetoed the appropriation. The Democrats did not have enough votes to override the veto, but they passed a new bill with the same rider. Hayes vetoed this as well, and the process was repeated three times more. Finally, Hayes signed an appropriation without the offensive rider.Frank P. Vazzano, \\"President Hayes, Congress and the Appropriations Riders Vetoes.\\" Congress & the Presidency 20#1 (1993) Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals, who were vital to the enforcement of the Enforcement Acts. The election laws remained in effect, though the funds to enforce them were curtailed. Hayes's strong stance against the Democratic attempts to repeal the election laws earned him the support of civil rights advocates in the North and boosted his popularity among some Republicans who had been alienated by his civil service reform efforts. Hayes tried to reconcile the social mores of the South with the civil rights laws by distributing patronage among Southern Democrats. \\"My task was to wipe out the color line, to abolish sectionalism, to end the war and bring peace,\\" he wrote in his diary. \\"To do this, I was ready to resort to unusual measures and to risk my own standing and reputation within my party and the country.\\" He also sought to build up a strong Republican Party in the South that appealed to both whites and blacks. All of his efforts were in vain; Hayes failed to convince the South to accept the idea of racial equality and failed to convince Congress to appropriate funds to enforce the civil rights laws. In the ensuing years and decades, African Americans would be almost completely disenfranchised.  National leadership  In the aftermath of the 1876 presidential election, power in national politics was very closely balanced. The Senate in 1877 contained 39 Republicans, 36 Democrats, and one independent, while the Democrats controlled the House of Representatives by the slim margin of 153 to 140. There were very few troublemakers or demagogues on either side as both parties saw the need to compromise and relax the heightened political tensions following the 1876 election. The economy had now recovered from the harsh depression that ended in 1873, and the nation welcomed economic expansion, farm prosperity, and the entrepreneurship that was building great industries such as iron and steel and petroleum. Historian Richard White most recently has emphasized the \\"Quest for Prosperity\\" that characterized the Gilded Age after Reconstruction ended.  Civil service reform  Hayes kicking Chester A. Arthur out of the New York Custom House After ending Reconstruction, Hayes turned to the issue of civil service reform. Instead of giving federal jobs to political supporters or the favorites of powerful members of Congress, Hayes favored appointment based on performance in civil service examinations. To show his commitment to reform, Hayes asked Secretary of the Interior Schurz and Secretary of State Evarts to lead a special cabinet committee charged with drawing up new rules for federal appointments. Senators of both parties who were accustomed to being consulted about political appointments turned against Hayes. Hayes's efforts for reform brought him into conflict with the Stalwart, or pro-spoils, branch of the Republican party, led by Senator Roscoe Conkling of New York. Treasury Secretary Sherman ordered John Jay to investigate the New York Custom House, which was stacked with Conkling's spoilsmen. Jay's report suggested that the New York Custom House was so overstaffed with political appointees and that 20 percent of the employees were expendable. With Congress unwilling to take action on civil service reform, Hayes issued an executive order that forbade federal office holders from being required to make campaign contributions or otherwise taking part in party politics. Chester A. Arthur, the Collector of the Port of New York, and his subordinates Alonzo B. Cornell and George H. Sharpe, all Conkling supporters, refused to obey the president's order. In September 1877, Hayes demanded the three men's resignations, which they refused to give. He submitted appointments of Theodore Roosevelt, Sr., L. Bradford Prince, and Edwin Merritt—all supporters of Secretary of State Evarts, Conkling's New York rival—to the Senate for confirmation as their replacements. The Senate Commerce Committee, which Conkling chaired, voted unanimously to reject the nominees, and the full Senate rejected Roosevelt and Prince by a vote of 31–25, confirming Merritt only because Sharpe's term had expired. Hayes was forced to wait until July 1878 when, during a Congressional recess, he sacked Arthur and Cornell and replaced them with recess appointments of Merritt and Silas W. Burt, respectively. Conkling opposed the appointees' confirmation when the Senate reconvened in February 1879, but Merritt was approved by a vote of 31–25, as was Burt by a 31–19 vote, giving Hayes his most significant civil service reform victory. For the remainder of his term, Hayes pressed Congress to enact permanent reform legislation and fund the United States Civil Service Commission, even using his last annual message to Congress in 1880 to appeal for reform. While reform legislation did not pass during Hayes's presidency, his advocacy provided the \\"political impetus\\" for the 1883 passage of the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act. Hayes allowed some exceptions to the ban on assessments, permitting George Congdon Gorham, secretary of the Republican Congressional Committee, to solicit campaign contributions from federal office-holders during the Congressional elections of 1878. In 1880, Hayes quickly forced Secretary of Navy Richard W. Thompson to resign office after Thompson had accepted a $25,000 salary for a nominal job offered by French engineer Ferdinand de Lesseps to promote a French canal in Panama. Hayes also dealt with corruption in the postal service. In 1880, Schurz and Senator John A. Logan asked Hayes to shut down the \\"star route\\" rings, a system of corrupt contract profiteering in the Postal Service, and to fire Second Assistant Postmaster-General Thomas J. Brady, the alleged ring leader. Hayes stopped granting new star route contracts, but let existing contracts continue to be enforced. Democrats accused Hayes of delaying proper investigation so as not to injure Republican chances in the 1880 elections but did not press the issue in their campaign literature, as members of both parties were implicated in the corruption. Historian Hans L. Trefousse writes that the president \\"hardly knew the chief suspect [Brady] and certainly had no connection with the [star route] corruption.\\" Although Hayes and the Congress both investigated the contracts and found no compelling evidence of wrongdoing, Brady and others were indicted for conspiracy in 1882. After two trials, the defendants were found not guilty in 1883.  1877 railroad strike  Burning of Union Depot, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, July 21–22, 1877 In his first year in office, Hayes was faced with the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, the largest labor disturbance up to that point in U.S. history. In order to make up for financial losses suffered since the Panic of 1873, the major railroads had cut their employees' wages several times. The Pennsylvania Railroad, one of the largest railroads, reduced the average worker's pay by approximately 25% between 1873 and 1877, and the railroad also imposed longer hours and stricter managerial control. In July 1877, workers from the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad walked off the job in Martinsburg, West Virginia, to protest their reduction in pay. The strike quickly spread to workers of the New York Central, Erie, and Pennsylvania railroads, with the strikers soon numbering in the thousands. In many communities, friends and family members of the railroad workers also became involved in the strike, and strike leaders struggled to control crowds. Fearing a riot, Governor Henry M. Mathews asked Hayes to send federal troops to Martinsburg, and Hayes did so, but when the troops arrived there was no riot, only a peaceful protest. In Baltimore, however, a riot did erupt on July 20 and Hayes ordered the troops at Fort McHenry to assist the governor in its suppression. Pittsburgh next exploded into riots, but Hayes was reluctant to send in troops without the governor first requesting them. Other discontented citizens joined the railroad workers in rioting. After a few days, Hayes resolved to send in troops to protect federal property wherever it appeared to be threatened and gave Major General Winfield Scott Hancock overall command of the situation. The riot spread to Chicago and St. Louis, where the Workingmen's Party organized a brief general strike. As the rioting spread, some began to fear a nationwide radical revolution inspired by the Paris Commune. This fear did not come to pass, as by the end of July 1877, state, local, and federal authorities had brought the labor disturbances to an end. Although no federal troops had killed any of the strikers, or been killed themselves, clashes between state militia troops and strikers resulted in deaths on both sides. The railroads were victorious in the short term, as the workers returned to their jobs and some wage cuts remained in effect. But the public blamed the railroads for the strikes and violence, and the railroads were compelled to improve working conditions and make no further cuts. Business leaders praised Hayes, but his own opinion was more equivocal; as he recorded in his diary: \\"The strikes have been put down by force; but now for the real remedy. Can't something [be] done by education of strikers, by judicious control of capitalists, by wise general policy to end or diminish the evil? The railroad strikers, as a rule, are good men, sober, intelligent, and industrious.\\" Hayes was the first president to deploy the U.S. Army to intervene in a labor dispute in the states. In response to the strike and the deployment of federal soldiers, Congress passed the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits the use of military personnel in resolving domestic disturbances.  Indian policy  An 1881 political cartoon about Carl Schurz's management of the Indian Bureau Interior Secretary Schurz carried out Hayes's American Indian policy, beginning with preventing the War Department from taking over the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Hayes and Schurz carried out a policy that included assimilation into white culture, educational training, and dividing Indian land into individual household allotments. Hayes believed that his policies would lead to self-sufficiency and peace between Indians and whites. The allotment system was favored by liberal reformers at the time, including Schurz, but instead proved detrimental to American Indians. They lost much of their land through later sales to unscrupulous white speculators. Hayes and Schurz reformed the Bureau of Indian Affairs to reduce fraud and gave Indians responsibility for policing their understaffed reservations. Hayes dealt with several conflicts with Indian tribes. The Nez Perce, led by Chief Joseph, began an uprising in June 1877 when Major General Oliver O. Howard ordered them to move on to a reservation. Howard's men defeated the Nez Perce in battle, and the tribe began a 1700-mile retreat into Canada. In October, after a decisive battle at Bear Paw, Montana, Chief Joseph surrendered and General William T. Sherman ordered the tribe transported to Kansas, where they were forced to remain until 1885. The Nez Perce war was not the last conflict in the West, as the Bannock rose up in Spring 1878 and raided nearby settlements before being defeated by Howard's army in July of that year. War with the Ute tribe broke out in 1879 when the Utes killed Indian agent Nathan Meeker, who had been attempting to convert them to Christianity. The subsequent White River War ended when Schurz negotiated peace with the Ute and prevented the white Coloradans from taking revenge for Meeker's death. Hayes also became involved in resolving the removal of the Ponca tribe from Nebraska to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma) because of a misunderstanding during the Grant Administration. The tribe's problems came to Hayes's attention after their chief, Standing Bear, filed a lawsuit to contest Schurz's demand that they stay in Indian Territory. Overruling Schurz, Hayes set up a commission in 1880 that ruled Ponca were free to return to Nebraska or stay on their reservation in Indian Territory. The Ponca were awarded compensation for their land rights, which had been previously granted to the Sioux. In a message to Congress in February 1881, Hayes insisted he would \\"give to these injured people that measure of redress which is required alike by justice and by humanity.\\" Finance and economics  Currency debate  Treasury Secretary John Sherman worked with Hayes to return the country to the gold standard. The Coinage Act of 1873 had stopped the coinage of silver for all coins worth a dollar or more, effectively tying the dollar to the value of gold. As a result, the money supply contracted and the effects of the Panic of 1873 grew worse, making it more expensive for debtors to pay debts they had contracted when currency was less valuable. Farmers and laborers, especially, clamored for the return of coinage in both metals, believing the increased money supply would restore wages and property values. Democratic Representative Richard P. Bland of Missouri proposed a bill that would require the United States to coin as much silver as miners could sell to the government, thus increasing the money supply and aiding debtors. William B. Allison, a Republican from Iowa offered an amendment in the Senate limiting the coinage to two to four million dollars per month, and the resulting Bland–Allison Act passed both houses of Congress in 1878. Hayes feared that the Bland–Allison Act would cause inflation that would be ruinous to business, effectively impairing contracts that were based on the gold dollar, as the silver dollar proposed in the bill would have an intrinsic value of 90 to 92 percent of the existing gold dollar. Further, Hayes believed that inflating the currency was an act of dishonesty, saying \\"[e]xpediency and justice both demand an honest currency.\\" He vetoed the bill, but Congress overrode his veto, the only time it did so during his presidency. As the Bland–Allison Act gave the president discretion in determining the number of silver coins minted, Hayes limited the effect of the act by authorizing the coining of only a relatively small number of silver coins. During the Civil War, the federal government had issued United States Notes (commonly called greenbacks), a form of fiat currency. The government accepted these notes as valid for payment of taxes and tariffs, but unlike ordinary dollars, they were not redeemable in gold. The Specie Payment Resumption Act of 1875 required the treasury to redeem any outstanding greenbacks in gold, thus retiring them from circulation and restoring the gold standard. Hayes and Secretary of the Treasury Sherman both support a restoration of the gold standard, and the Hayes administration stockpiled gold in preparation for the exchange of greenbacks for gold. Once the public was confident that they could redeem greenbacks for specie (gold), however, few did so; when the act took effect in 1879, only $130,000 out of the $346,000,000 outstanding dollars in greenbacks were actually redeemed. Together with the Bland–Allison Act, the successful specie resumption effected a workable compromise between inflationists and hard money men. As the world economy began to improve, agitation for more greenbacks and silver coinage quieted down for the rest of Hayes's term in office.  Pensions and tariffs  In 1861, Congress had significantly raised tariffs with the passage of the Morrill Tariff, which funded the Civil War and also protected American industries like iron and steel. The high rates of the Morrill Tariff remained in effect in the 1870s, leading to a federal budgetary surplus. Though the tariff was politically popular in the industrialized Northeast, it had many detractors in the South and Midwest, as high tariff rates led to higher prices. Seeking to shore up the tariff's popularity, Senator Henry W. Blair proposed the Arrears Act, which Hayes signed in 1879. The Arrears Act expanded the pension system designed to benefit Union Civil War veterans by making pension payments retroactive to a soldier's discharge or death rather than the date of their application. In practice, this meant sending large checks to veterans and their families, and pension disbursements doubled between 1879 and 1881. The act proved extremely popular outside of the South and spread support for Republicans and high tariff rates.  Foreign affairs  Panamanian Canal the United States ( Columbia) rejects De Lesseps plan for a French-owned Panama Canal. By Thomas Nast, April 10, 1880, Harper's Weekly A political cartoon from 1882, criticizing Chinese exclusion Hayes was perturbed over the plans of Ferdinand de Lesseps, the builder of the Suez Canal, to construct a canal across the Isthmus of Panama, which was then owned by Colombia. Concerned about a repetition of French adventurism in Mexico, Hayes interpreted the Monroe Doctrine firmly. In a message to Congress, Hayes explained his opinion on the canal: \\"The policy of this country is a canal under American control ... The United States cannot consent to the surrender of this control to any European power or any combination of European powers.\\" De Lesseps went ahead anyway, raised very large sums, and began construction. Disease ravaged his workforce, and his project collapsed in corruption and incompetence. Mexico Throughout the 1870s, \\"lawless bands\\" often crossed the Mexican border on raids into Texas. Three months after taking office, Hayes granted the Army the power to pursue bandits, even if it required crossing into Mexican territory. Porfirio Díaz, the Mexican president, protested the order and sent troops to the border. The situation calmed as Díaz and Hayes agreed to jointly pursue bandits and Hayes agreed not to allow Mexican revolutionaries to raise armies in the United States. The violence along the border decreased, and in 1880 Hayes revoked the order allowing pursuit into Mexico. Chinese immigration The Hayes administration gave significant attention to U.S.–China relations as Chinese immigration became a contentious issue during Hayes's presidency. In 1868, the Senate had ratified the Burlingame Treaty with China, allowing an unrestricted flow of Chinese immigrants into the country. As the economy soured after the Panic of 1873, Chinese immigrants were blamed for depressing workmen's wages. During the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, anti-Chinese riots broke out in San Francisco, and a third party, the Workingman's Party, was formed with an emphasis on stopping Chinese immigration. In response, Congress passed a measure, the \\"Fifteen Passenger Bill\\" in 1879, aimed at limiting the number of Chinese passengers permitted on vessels arriving at U.S. ports. As the legislation would violate the terms of the Burlingame Treaty, Hayes, believing that the United States should not unilaterally abrogate treaties, vetoed it. The veto drew praise among eastern liberals, but Hayes was bitterly denounced in the West. In the subsequent furor, Democrats in the House of Representatives attempted to impeach him, but narrowly failed when Republicans prevented a quorum by refusing to vote. After the veto, Assistant Secretary of State Frederick W. Seward and James Burrill Angell negotiated with the Chinese to reduce the number of Chinese immigrants. The resulting accord, the Angell Treaty of 1880, allowed the U.S. to suspend Chinese immigration, which Congress did (after Hayes left office) with the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Other issues In 1878, following the Paraguayan War, the president arbitrated a territorial dispute between Argentina and Paraguay. Hayes awarded the disputed land in the Gran Chaco region to Paraguay, and the Paraguayans honored him by renaming a city (Villa Hayes) and a department as (Presidente Hayes) in his honor. The administration sought friendly relations with the major European powers, though not to the detriment of the Monroe Doctrine. Hayes upheld the Treaty of Washington, ending the dispute with Great Britain caused by the Alabama Claims. He refused the annexation request of Samoa, instead establishing a de facto tripartite protectorate with Great Britain and Germany.  Last year in office   Western tour, 1880  In 1880, Hayes embarked on a 71-day tour of the American West, becoming the first sitting President to travel west of the Rocky Mountains. Hayes' traveling party included his wife and General William Tecumseh Sherman, who helped organize the trip. Hayes began his trip in September 1880, departing from Chicago on the transcontinental railroad. He journeyed across the continent, ultimately arriving in California, stopping first in Wyoming and then Utah and Nevada, reaching Sacramento and San Francisco. By railroad and stagecoach, the party traveled north to Oregon, arriving in Portland, and from there to Vancouver, Washington. Going by steamship, they visited Seattle, and then returned to San Francisco. Hayes then toured several southwestern states before returning to Ohio in November, in time to cast a vote in the 1880 presidential election.  1880 presidential election  Republican James Garfield defeated Democrat Winfield Scott Hancock in the 1880 election Although some Republicans urged Hayes to run for a second term, he was looking forward to retirement, and so stuck to his 1876 promise to serve only one term. When Republicans convened in June 1880, in Chicago, the fight for the nomination stood between former President Grant and Senator James Blaine. Congressman James A. Garfield, head of the Ohio delegation and chairman of the Convention Rules Committee, backed Treasury Secretary John Sherman. Elihu B. Washburne, George F. Edmunds, and William Windom also emerged as potential nominees. The convention deadlocked through thirty-three ballots, with Grant leading, followed by Blaine and Sherman. On the thirty-fourth ballot, Garfield received sixteen votes from Wisconsin, and Blaine and Sherman backers switched their support to Garfield on subsequent ballots. On the thirty-sixth ballot, Garfield won 399 votes to Grant's 306, putting him over the top and giving him the Republican nomination. The convention nominated Chester A. Arthur, the former port collector of New York, to serve as Garfield's running mate. Hayes was pleased with the ticket, which provided a balance between Half-Breeds and Stalwarts, and he appreciated the convention's endorsement of his presidency. The 1880 Democratic National Convention met in June and nominated General Winfield Scott Hancock. With the Democrats firmly in control of the South, a Republican victory would require strong performances in the Northern swing states of Indiana, Ohio, New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut. The Republican Party campaigned on their support for universal manhood suffrage and argued that Republican policies had led to economic prosperity. Though Hancock swept the South and won most of the Far West, Garfield won the election by dominating the Northeast and the Midwest. Garfield won an extremely narrow popular vote plurality, with a margin of less than 0.1%. James B. Weaver of the Greenback Party took over 3% of the popular vote. In the weeks following Garfield's election, Hayes and Garfield worked with each other to assure a smooth transition of power. Historical reputation Historian Ari Hoogenboom argues that Hayes was a shrewd politician and a \\"patient reformer who attempted what was possible.\\" Hoogenboom contends that Hayes's most serious mistake was choosing not to run for second term, which would have allowed Hayes to more fully implement his agenda. Historian Keith Polakoff basically agrees with Hoogenboom. Hayes accepted the presidency as a personal honor, not as a challenge to introduce new policies. He worked to calm crises, including Reconstruction and the great 1877 railroad strike. Efficiency was his watchword and was the goal of the main reform he promoted, replacing patronage appointees with civil service professionals. However he did not work hard enough to achieve it against the forces of party patronage. He gave his cabinet wide leeway, and did not interfere or guide their major activities. Hayes often clashed with Congress to protect presidential prerogatives, but that was passive activity that led to nothing new. He did take credit for helping elect his old friend James Garfield as his successor.Keith Ian Polakoff, \\"Rutherford B. Hayes\\" in Henry F. Graff. ed. The Presidents: A Reference History (3rd ed. 2002) pp 261-72 online Kenneth Davison emphasizes how hard he worked Hayes, especially through long speaking tours, to promote national unity and an end to sectional and class and racial conflicts of the sort that had generated so much hatred and violence for the previous two decades.Kenneth E. Davison, The Presidency of Rutherford B. Hayes (1972) pp 210-23. Polls of historians and political scientists have generally ranked Hayes as a below-average president. A 2018 poll of the American Political Science Association’s Presidents and Executive Politics section ranked Hayes as the 28th best president. A 2017 C-Span poll of historians ranked Hayes as the 32nd best president.  Notes   References   Bibliography   Books  Burgess, John William.

Arthur began on September 19, 1881, when Arthur became the 21st President of the United States upon the assassination and death of President James A. Garfield, and ended on March 4, 1885. Arthur, a Republican, had been Vice President of the United States for only days when he succeeded to the presidency. In ill health and lacking the full support of his party by the end of his term, Arthur made only a token effort for the Republican nomination in the 1884 presidential election. He was succeeded by Democrat Grover Cleveland. Garfield chose Arthur as his running mate in the 1880 United States presidential election due to the latter's association with the Republican Party's Stalwart faction, and Arthur struggled to overcome his reputation as a New York City machine politician. He embraced the cause of U.S. Civil Service Reform, and his advocacy and enforcement of the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act became the centerpiece of his administration. Though patronage remained a powerful force in politics, the Pendleton Act laid the foundations for a professional civil service that would emerge in subsequent decades. Facing a budget surplus, Arthur signed the Tariff of 1883, which reduced tariffs. He also vetoed the Rivers and Harbors Act, an act that would have appropriated federal funds in a manner he thought excessive, and oversaw a building program for the United States Navy. After the Supreme Court struck down the Civil Rights Act of 1875, Arthur favored new civil rights legislation to protect African-Americans, but was unable to win passage of a new bill. In foreign policy, Arthur pursued closer economic and political relations with Latin America, but many of his proposed trade agreements were defeated in the United States Senate. The 1884 Republican National Convention passed over Arthur in favor of James G. Blaine, but Cleveland defeated Blaine in the 1884 presidential election. Although Arthur's failing health and political temperament combined to make his administration less active than a modern presidency, he earned praise among contemporaries for his solid performance in office. Journalist Alexander McClure later wrote, \\"No man ever entered the presidency so profoundly and widely distrusted as Chester Alan Arthur, and no one ever retired ... more generally respected, alike by political friend and foe.\\" Since his death, Arthur's reputation has mostly faded from the public consciousness. Although some have praised his flexibility and willingness to embrace reform, present-day historians and scholars generally rank him as a below-average president. Accession Arthur taking the oath of office as administered by Judge John R. Brady at Arthur's home in New York City, September 20, 1881 After President Rutherford B. Hayes declined to seek re- election in 1880, several candidates vied for the presidential nomination at the 1880 Republican National Convention. The convention dead-locked between supporters of former President Ulysses S. Grant and Senator James G. Blaine, resulting in the nomination of a dark horse candidate, James A. Garfield. Hoping to unite the Republican Party behind his candidacy, Garfield decided to select a follower of New York Senator Roscoe Conkling, a leader of the party's Stalwart faction, as his running mate. Garfield settled on Arthur, a former Collector of the Port of New York who was closely allied with Conkling. The Garfield-Arthur ticket won the 1880 presidential election, but after taking office, Garfield clashed with Conkling over appointments and other issues. Arthur's continued loyalty to Conkling marginalized him within the Garfield administration and, after the Senate went into recess in May 1881, Arthur returned to his home state of New York. On July 2, 1881, Arthur learned that Garfield had been badly wounded in a shooting. The shooter, Charles J. Guiteau, was a deranged office-seeker who believed that Garfield's successor would appoint him to a patronage job. Though he had barely known Guiteau, Arthur had to allay suspicions that he had been behind the assassination. He was reluctant to be seen acting as president while Garfield lived, and in the months after the shooting, with Garfield near death and Arthur still in New York, there was a void of authority in the executive office. Many worried about the prospect of an Arthur presidency; the New York Times, which had supported Arthur earlier in his career, wrote \\"Arthur is about the last man who would be considered eligible for the position.\\" Garfield died on September 19, and Judge John R. Brady of the New York Supreme Court administered the oath of office to Arthur in the latter's New York City home at 2:15 a.m. on September 20. Before leaving New York, Arthur ensured the presidential line of succession by preparing and mailing to the White House a proclamation calling for a Senate special session, thus ensuring that the Senate could select a president pro tempore, who would be first in the presidential line of succession. On September 22, Arthur re-took the oath of office, this time before Chief Justice Morrison R. Waite. He took this step to ensure procedural compliance; there were lingering questions about whether Brady, a state court judge, could administer a federal oath of office. Arthur ordered a remodeling of the White House and took up residence at the home of Senator John P. Jones until December 1881, when he moved into the White House. As Arthur was a widower, his sister, Mary Arthur McElroy, served as the de facto First Lady of the United States. Arthur took office over a growing country (population had increased from 30 million in 1860 to 50 million in 1880) that maintained a budget surplus and peaceful relations with the great powers of the day. Administration Arthur quickly came into conflict with Garfield's cabinet, most of whom represented opposing factions within the party. At the same time, he distanced himself from Conkling, and he sought to appoint officials who were well-regarded by both reformers and party loyalists. Arthur asked Garfield's cabinet members to remain until December 1881, when Congress would reconvene, but Treasury Secretary William Windom submitted his resignation in October to enter a Senate race in his home state of Minnesota. Arthur then selected Charles J. Folger, his friend and a fellow New York Stalwart, as Windom's replacement. Attorney General Wayne MacVeagh was next to resign, believing that, as a reformer, he had no place in an Arthur cabinet. Arthur replaced MacVeagh with Benjamin H. Brewster, a Philadelphia lawyer and machine politician reputed to have reformist leanings. Secretary of State Blaine, one of the key leaders of the Half-Breed faction of the Republican Party, also resigned in December. Conkling expected Arthur to appoint him in Blaine's place, as he had been Arthur's patron for much of the latter's career. But the president chose Frederick T. Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, a Stalwart recommended by former President Grant. Though Frelinghuysen advised Arthur not to fill any future vacancies with Stalwarts, Arthur selected Timothy O. Howe, a Wisconsin Stalwart, to replace Postmaster General Thomas Lemuel James after the latter resigned in January 1882. Navy Secretary William H. Hunt was next to resign, in April 1882, and Arthur attempted to placate the Half-Breeds by appointing William E. Chandler, who had been recommended by Blaine. Finally, when Interior Secretary Samuel J. Kirkwood resigned that same month, Arthur appointed Henry M. Teller, a Colorado Stalwart, to the office. Of the cabinet members Arthur had inherited from Garfield, only Secretary of War Robert Todd Lincoln remained for the entirety of Arthur's term. Judicial appointments Arthur made appointments to fill two vacancies on the United States Supreme Court. The first vacancy arose in July 1881 with the death of Associate Justice Nathan Clifford, a Democrat who had been a member of the Court since before the American Civil War. Arthur nominated Horace Gray, a distinguished jurist from the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, to replace Clifford, and the nomination was easily confirmed. Gray would remain on the Court until 1902. A second vacancy occurred when Associate Justice Ward Hunt retired in January 1882. Arthur first nominated his old political boss, Roscoe Conkling; he doubted that Conkling would accept, but felt obligated to offer a high office to his former patron. The Senate confirmed the nomination but, as expected, Conkling declined it, the last time a confirmed nominee declined an appointment. Senator George Edmunds was Arthur's next choice, but he declined to be considered. Instead, Arthur nominated Samuel Blatchford, who had been a judge on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals for the prior four years. Blatchford accepted, and his nomination was approved by the Senate within two weeks. Blatchford served on the Court until his death in 1893. In addition to his two Supreme Court appointments, Arthur also appointed four circuit court judges and fourteen district court judges. Civil service reform Pendleton Act Ole Peter Hansen Balling's 1881 portrait of Chester A. Arthur In the early 1880s, American politics operated on the spoils system, a political patronage practice in which victorious candidates rewarded their loyal supporters, family, and friends by installing them in government civil service positions. Movements calling for Civil Service Reform arose in the wake of the corruption in the Grant Administration. In 1880, Democratic Senator George H. Pendleton of Ohio had introduced legislation to require the selection of civil servants based on merit as determined by an examination. The measure failed to pass, but Garfield's assassination by a deranged office seeker amplified the public demand for reform. Late in 1881, in his first annual address to Congress, Arthur requested civil service reform legislation, and Pendleton again introduced his bill, which again did not pass. Then, in the 1882 congressional elections, Republicans suffered a crushing defeat. The party lost its majority control in the House of Representatives, as Democrats, campaigning on the reform issue, defeated 40 Republican incumbents and picked up a total of 70 seats. This defeat helped convince many Republicans to support the reform proposal during the 1882 lame-duck session of Congress; the Senate approved the bill 38–5 and the House soon concurred by a vote of 155–47. Arthur signed the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act into law on January 16, 1883. The bill created a civil service commission to oversee civil service examinations and outlawed the use of \\"assessments,\\" fees that political appointees were expected to pay to their respective political parties as the price for their appointments. These reforms had previously been proposed by the Jay Commission, which had investigated Arthur during his time as Collector of the Port of New York. In just two years' time, an unrepentant Stalwart had become the president who ushered in long-awaited civil service reform. Even after Arthur signed the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act into law, proponents of the act doubted Arthur's commitment to reform. The act initially applied only to ten percent of federal jobs and, without proper implementation by the president, would not have affected the remaining civil service positions. To the surprise of his critics, Arthur acted quickly to appoint the members of the newly-created Civil Service Commission, naming reformers Dorman Bridgman Eaton, John Milton Gregory, and Leroy D. Thoman as commissioners. The chief examiner, Silas W. Burt, was a long-time reformer who had been Arthur's opponent when the two men worked at the New York Customs House. The commission issued its first rules in May 1883; by 1884, half of all postal officials and three-quarters of the Customs Service jobs were to be awarded by merit. Arthur expressed satisfaction with the new system, praising its effectiveness \\"in securing competent and faithful public servants and in protecting the appointing officers of the Government from the pressure of personal importunity and from the labor of examining the claims and pretensions of rival candidates for public employment.\\" Although state patronage systems and numerous federal positions were unaffected by the law, Karabell argues that the Pendleton Act was instrumental in the creation of a professional civil service and the rise of the modern bureaucratic state. The law also caused major changes in campaign finance, as the parties were forced to look for new sources of campaign funds, such as wealthy donors. Star Route scandal In the 1870s, the public had learned of the star route scandal, in which contractors for star postal routes were greatly overpaid for their services with the connivance of government officials, including former Senator Stephen Wallace Dorsey). Although Arthur had worked closely with Dorsey before his presidency, once in office he supported the investigation and forced the resignation of officials suspected in the scandal. An 1882 trial of the ringleaders resulted in convictions for two minor conspirators and a hung jury for the rest. After a juror came forward with allegations that the defendants attempted to bribe him, the judge set aside the guilty verdicts and granted a new trial. Before the second trial began, Arthur removed five federal office holders who were sympathetic with the defense, including a former senator. The second trial began in December 1882 and lasted until July 1883 and, again, did not result in a guilty verdict. Failure to obtain a conviction tarnished the administration's image, but Arthur did succeed in putting a stop to the fraud. Surplus and the tariff With high revenue held over from wartime taxes, the federal government had collected more than it spent since 1866; by 1882 the surplus reached $145 million. Opinions varied on how to reduce the budget surplus; the Democrats favored reducing the surplus by lowering tariffs, which would in turn reduce the cost of imported goods. Republicans believed that high tariffs ensured high wages in manufacturing and mining, and they preferred reducing the surplus through spending more on internal improvements and cutting excise taxes. The debate over the tariff was complicated by the fact that each interest preferred higher tariffs for their particular field; many Southerners, for example, preferred low tariffs in general but favored higher tariffs for cotton, a major crop in the South. These competing interests led to the development of a complicated tariff system that levied different rates on different imports. Arthur agreed with his party, and in 1882 called for the abolition of excise taxes on everything except liquor, as well as a simplification of the complex tariff structure. In May 1882, Representative William D. Kelley of Pennsylvania introduced a bill to establish a tariff commission. Arthur signed the bill into law and appointed mostly protectionists to the committee. Republicans were pleased with the committee's make-up but were surprised when, in December 1882, the committee submitted a report to Congress calling for tariff cuts averaging between 20 percent and 25 percent. The commission's recommendations were ignored, however, as the House Ways and Means Committee, dominated by protectionists, passed a bill providing for a 10 percent reduction in tariff rates. After a conference with the Senate, the bill that emerged only reduced tariffs by an average of 1.47 percent. The bill passed both houses narrowly on March 3, 1883, the last full day of the 47th Congress. Arthur signed the measure into law, and it had no effect on the budget surplus. Congress attempted to balance the budget from the other side of the ledger, with increased spending on the 1882 Rivers and Harbors Act in the unprecedented amount of $19 million. While Arthur was not opposed to internal improvements, the scale of the bill disturbed him, as did what he saw as its narrow focus on \\"particular localities\\" rather than projects that benefited a larger part of the nation. On August 1, 1882, Arthur vetoed the bill to widespread popular acclaim; in his veto message, his principal objection was that it appropriated funds for purposes \\"not for the common defense or general welfare, and which do not promote commerce among the States.\\" Congress overrode his veto the next day and the new law reduced the surplus by $19 million. Republicans considered the law a success at the time, but later concluded that it contributed to their loss of seats in the elections of 1882. Foreign affairs and immigration A political cartoon from 1882, criticizing Chinese exclusion During his brief tenure in the Garfield and Arthur administrations, Secretary of State James G. Blaine attempted to invigorate United States diplomacy in Latin America, urging reciprocal trade agreements and offering to mediate disputes among the Latin American nations. Blaine hoped that increased U.S. involvement in the region would counter growing European (particularly British) influence in the Western Hemisphere. Blaine proposed a Pan-American conference in 1882 to discuss trade and an end to the War of the Pacific, but conference efforts lapsed after Blaine was replaced by Frelinghuysen in late 1881. On the other hand, Arthur and Frelinghuysen continued Blaine's efforts to encourage trade among the nations of the Western Hemisphere; a treaty with Mexico providing for reciprocal tariff reductions was signed in 1882 and approved by the Senate in 1884. Legislation required to bring the treaty into force failed in the House, however. Similar efforts at reciprocal trade treaties with Santo Domingo and Spain's American colonies were defeated by February 1885, and an existing reciprocity treaty with the Kingdom of Hawaii was allowed to lapse. The Frelinghuysen-Zavala Treaty, which would have allowed the United States to build a canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans via Nicaragua, was also defeated in the Senate. The 47th Congress spent a great deal of time on immigration. In July 1882 Congress easily passed a bill regulating steamships that carried immigrants to the United States. To their surprise, Arthur vetoed it and requested revisions, which they made and Arthur then approved. Arthur also signed the Immigration Act of 1882, which levied a 50-cent tax on immigrants to the United States, and excluded from entry the mentally ill, the intellectually disabled, criminals, or any other person potentially dependent upon public assistance. Chinese immigration was a major political issue in the 1870s and 1880s, and it became a subject of debate in the 47th Congress. When Arthur took office, there were 250,000 Chinese immigrants in the United States, most of whom lived in California and worked as farmers or laborers. In January 1868, the Senate had ratified the Burlingame Treaty with China, allowing an unrestricted flow of Chinese into the country; when the economy soured after the Panic of 1873, many Americans blamed Chinese immigrants for depressing workmen's wages. In 1879, President Rutherford B. Hayes vetoed the Chinese Exclusion Act, which would have abrogated the Burlingame Treaty. Three years later, after China had agreed to treaty revisions, Congress tried again to exclude Chinese immigrants; Senator John F. Miller of California introduced another Chinese Exclusion Act that denied Chinese immigrants United States citizenship and banned their immigration for a twenty-year period. Miller's bill passed the Senate and House by overwhelming margins, but Arthur vetoed the bill, as he believed that the twenty-year ban breached the renegotiated treaty of 1880. That treaty allowed only a \\"reasonable\\" suspension of immigration. Eastern newspapers praised the veto, while it was condemned in the Western states. Congress was unable to override the veto, but passed a new bill reducing the immigration ban to ten years. Although he still objected to this denial of citizenship to Chinese immigrants, Arthur acceded to the compromise measure, signing the Chinese Exclusion Act into law on May 6, 1882. Naval reform The \\"Squadron of Evolution\\" at anchor in 1889, after Yorktown had been added: Chicago, Yorktown, Boston, Atlanta In the years following the Civil War, American naval power declined precipitously, shrinking from nearly 700 vessels to just 52, most of which were obsolete. The nation's military focus over the fifteen years before Garfield and Arthur's election had been on the Indian wars in the West, rather than the high seas, but as the region was increasingly pacified, many in Congress grew concerned at the poor state of the Navy. Garfield's Secretary of the Navy, William H. Hunt, had advocated reform of the Navy and his successor, William E. Chandler, appointed an advisory board to prepare a report on modernization. Based on the suggestions in the report, Congress appropriated funds for the construction of three steel protected cruisers (Atlanta, Boston, and Chicago) and an armed dispatch-steamer (Dolphin), collectively known as the ABCD Ships or the Squadron of Evolution. Congress also approved funds to rebuild four monitors (Puritan, Amphitrite, Monadnock, and Terror), which had lain uncompleted since 1877. Arthur strongly supported these efforts, believing that a strengthened navy would not only increase the country's security but also enhance U.S. prestige. The contracts to build the ABCD ships were all awarded to the low bidder, John Roach & Sons of Chester, Pennsylvania, even though Roach once employed Secretary Chandler as a lobbyist. Democrats turned against the \\"New Navy\\" projects and, when they won control of the 48th Congress, refused to appropriate funds for seven more steel warships. Even without the additional ships, the state of the Navy improved when, after several construction delays, the last of the new ships entered service in 1889. Civil rights and the South Readjuster Party leader William Mahone pressed civil rights in Virginia. Like his Republican predecessors, Arthur struggled with the question of how his party was to challenge the Democrats in the South and how, if at all, to protect the civil rights of black Southerners. Since the end of Reconstruction, conservative white Democrats (or \\"Bourbon Democrats\\") had regained power in the South, and the Republican Party dwindled rapidly as their primary supporters in the region, blacks, were disenfranchised. One crack in the solidly Democratic South emerged with the growth of a new party, the Readjusters, in Virginia. Having won an election in that state on a platform of more education funding (for black and white schools alike) and abolition of the poll tax and the whipping post, many northern Republicans saw the Readjusters as a more viable ally in the South than the moribund Southern Republican party. Arthur agreed, and directed the federal patronage in Virginia through the Readjusters rather than the Republicans. He followed the same pattern in other Southern states, forging coalitions with independents and Greenback Party members. Some black Republicans felt betrayed by the pragmatic gambit, but others (including Frederick Douglass and ex-Senator Blanche K. Bruce) endorsed the administration's actions, as the Southern independents had more liberal racial policies than the Democrats. Arthur's coalition policy was only successful in Virginia, however, and by 1885 the Readjuster movement had begun to collapse. Other federal action on behalf of blacks was equally ineffective: when the Supreme Court struck down the Civil Rights Act of 1875 in the Civil Rights Cases (1883), Arthur expressed his disagreement with the decision in a message to Congress, but was unable to persuade Congress to pass any new legislation in its place. The Civil Rights Act of 1875 had banned discrimination in public accommodations, and its overturning was an important component in the rise of the Jim Crow era of segregation and discrimination. Arthur did, however, effectively intervene to overturn a court-martial ruling against a black West Point cadet, Johnson Whittaker, after the Judge Advocate General of the Army, David G. Swaim, found the prosecution's case against Whittaker to be illegal and based on racism. The administration faced a different challenge in the West, where the LDS Church was under government pressure to stop the practice of polygamy in Utah Territory. Garfield had believed polygamy was criminal behavior and was morally detrimental to family values, and Arthur's views were, for once, in line with his predecessor's. In 1882, he signed the Edmunds Act into law; the legislation made polygamy a federal crime, barring polygamists both from public office and the right to vote. Native American policy The Arthur administration was challenged by changing relations with Western Native American tribes. With the American Indian Wars winding down, public sentiment was shifting toward more favorable treatment of Native Americans. Arthur urged Congress to increase funding for Native American education, which it did in 1884, although not to the extent he wished. He also favored a move to the allotment system, under which individual Native Americans, rather than tribes, would own land. Arthur was unable to convince Congress to adopt the idea during his administration but, in 1887, the Dawes Act changed the law to favor such a system. The allotment system was favored by liberal reformers at the time, but eventually proved detrimental to Native Americans as most of their land was resold at low prices to white speculators. During Arthur's presidency, settlers and cattle ranchers continued to encroach on Native American territory. Arthur initially resisted their efforts, but after Secretary of the Interior Teller, an opponent of allotment, assured him that the lands were not protected, Arthur opened up the Crow Creek Reservation in the Dakota Territory to settlers by executive order in 1885. Arthur's successor, Grover Cleveland, finding that title belonged to the Native Americans, revoked the order a few months later. Health, travel, and 1884 election Arthur on an expedition in Yellowstone National Park along with Philip Sheridan and Robert Todd Lincoln Declining health Shortly after becoming president, Arthur was diagnosed with Bright's disease, a kidney ailment now referred to as nephritis. He attempted to keep his condition private, but by 1883 rumors of his illness began to circulate; he had become thinner and more aged in appearance, and struggled to keep the pace of the presidency. To rejuvenate his health outside the confines of Washington, Arthur and some political friends traveled to Florida in April 1883. The vacation had the opposite effect, and Arthur suffered from intense pain before returning to Washington. Shortly after returning from Florida, Arthur visited his home town of New York City, where he presided over the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge. In July, on the advice of Missouri Senator George Graham Vest, he visited Yellowstone National Park. Reporters accompanied the presidential party, helping to publicize the new National Park system. The Yellowstone trip was more beneficial to Arthur's health than his Florida excursion, and he returned to Washington refreshed after two months of travel. 1884 election As the election approached, Arthur came to realize that, like Hayes in 1880, he was unlikely to win renomination in 1884. In the months leading up to the 1884 Republican National Convention, James G. Blaine emerged as the favorite for the nomination, though Arthur had not totally given up on his hopes for another term. It quickly became clear to Arthur, however, that neither of the major party factions was prepared to give him their full support: the Half-Breeds were again solidly behind Blaine, while the Stalwarts were undecided. Some Stalwarts backed Arthur, but others supported Senator John A. Logan of Illinois. Reform-minded Republicans, friendlier to Arthur after he endorsed civil service reform, were still not certain enough of his reform credentials to back him over Senator George F. Edmunds of Vermont, who had long favored their cause. Some business leaders supported Arthur, as did Southern Republicans who owed their jobs to his control of the patronage, but by the time they began to rally around him, Arthur had decided against a serious campaign for the nomination. He kept up a token effort, believing that to drop out would cast doubt on his actions in office and raise questions about his health, but by the time the convention began in June, his defeat was assured. Blaine led on the first ballot, and by the fourth ballot he had a majority. Arthur telegraphed his congratulations to Blaine and accepted his defeat with equanimity. Arthur is the most recent individual to accede to the presidency after the death of a predecessor but be denied his party's nomination to a full term. Democrat Grover Cleveland defeated Republican James G. Blaine in the 1884 election Arthur played no role in the 1884 campaign, which Blaine would later blame for his loss that November to the Democratic nominee, Grover Cleveland. Blaine's campaign was damaged by the defection of the Mugwumps, a group of Republicans who believed that the Pendleton Act had not sufficiently diminished public corruption. Blaine also made a critical error in the swing state of New York when he failed to distance himself from an attack on Catholicism. Cleveland swept the Solid South and won enough Northern states to take a majority of the electoral vote. A change of just 1,000 votes in New York would have given Blaine the presidency. Cleveland's victory made him the first Democrat to win a presidential election since the Civil War. Historical reputation Arthur appears on the 21-cent U.S. Postage stamp of the 1938 Presidential Series. Arthur's tepid popularity in life carried over into his assessment by historians, and his reputation after leaving office disappeared. By 1935, historian George F. Howe said that Arthur had achieved \\"an obscurity in strange contrast to his significant part in American history.\\" By 1975, however, Thomas C. Reeves would write that Arthur's \\"appointments, if unspectacular, were unusually sound; the corruption and scandal that dominated business and politics of the period did not tarnish his administration.\\" As 2004 biographer Zachary Karabell wrote, although Arthur was \\"physically stretched and emotionally strained, he strove to do what was right for the country.\\" Indeed, Howe had earlier surmised, \\"Arthur adopted [a code] for his own political behavior but subject to three restraints: he remained to everyone a man of his word; he kept scrupulously free from corrupt graft; he maintained a personal dignity, affable and genial though he might be. These restraints ... distinguished him sharply from the stereotype politician.\\" In his final assessment of Arthur, Karabell argues that Arthur lacked the vision or force of character to achieve greatness, but that he deserves credit for presiding over a period of peace and prosperity. Polls of historians and political scientists have generally ranked Arthur as a below-average president. A 2018 poll of the American Political Science Association’s Presidents and Executive Politics section ranked Arthur as the 29th best president. A 2017 C-SPAN survey has Chester Arthur ranked among the bottom third of presidents of all time, right below Martin Van Buren and above Herbert Hoover. The survey asked 91 presidential historians to rank the 43 former presidents (including then-outgoing president Barack Obama) in various categories to come up with a composite score, resulting in an overall ranking. Arthur was ranked 35th among all former presidents (down from 32nd in 2009 and 2000). His rankings in the various categories of this most recent poll were as follows: public persuasion (37), crisis leadership (32), economic management (31), moral authority (35), international relations (35), administrative skills (28), relations with congress (29), vision/setting an agenda (34), pursued equal justice for all (27), performance with context of times (32).

It is near the American Civil War battlefield Antietam, Washington Monument State Park, and the Appalachian Trail. It is one of the oldest farms still functioning in the historic area. It was owned by the Schlosser family as early as April 6, 1841, when local deed records show it was transferred from Joel Schlosser to his wife and children. It is likely that the structure had been built shortly after 1835, when Joel was married to Catherine Doub, a member of the Doub (family). The home was held by the Schlossers for almost 140 years, until March 30, 1973, when they sold it to Clarence B. Crane. Stoney Creek Farm stayed in the Crane family until July 24, 2000 when it was sold to Mark and Kimberly Schmidt. On October 31, 2004 it was sold to Brandon Green, Joseph Farone, and David Kempton. The trio restored it in 2005 and it is now a quiet bed and breakfast with four bedrooms and an event site hosting numerous weddings, private parties and corporate retreats throughout the year. Joel Schlosser's Ancestors According to local deed records, Joel Schlosser is the first recorded owner of the property known today as Stoney Creek Farm. The Schlosser family has long ties to Boonsboro and Washington County, Maryland, and parts of Pennsylvania after their immigration from Germany in the late 18th century. In fact, Joel’s brother David served as the mayor of Boonsboro from 1869 to 1872, and many family members are buried in the Boonsboro Reformed Church Graveyard or on private property close by. The Schlessor family owned the farm for almost 140 years. Joel Schlosser transferred ownership of the farm to his wife and children on April 6, 1841. It was likely obtained by Schlosser as part of a larger parcel belonging to his father, John Schlosser. Transfers of land between family members did not require the governmental deed recordation until the mid-19th century in most cases. It is likely that the structure had been built shortly after 1835, when Joel was married to Catherine Doub. Joel’s father John Schlosser had been born in Germany on April 2, 1782, and his mother, the former Elizabeth Painter, had been born on September 21, 1783. They married about 1798, and had seven children, including: Simon (born about 1799), Eli (born between 1801 and 1818), Sarah (born December 13, 1804), Mary (born between 1802 and 1829, David (born October 25, 1814), Samuel (born 1822), and Joel, the owner of 19223 Manor Church Road, who had been born on November 11, 1810. His father John (died August 20, 1862), and mother Elizabeth (died July 19, 1855) are both buried in the Reformed Church Graveyard in Boonsboro, Maryland. Joel’s grandfather, Peter Schlosser, was born about 1736 in Pennsylvania. He died on October 23, 1834, on his homestead in Washington County, and was buried “on farm by Iron Bridge, Antietam Creek.” The bridge was later referred to in the local newspapers as Schlosser’s Bridge, located adjacent to their farm holdings. He had married the former Susannah Regnas in Cumberland, Maryland, on April 4, 1769, who had been born in Germany on September 28, 1749, and they had four children together, including John. Susannah died on Halloween in 1830, and is buried adjacent to her husband. Joel’s great-grandfather was also named Peter Schlosser, and he had been born on January 20, 1709 in Hilsbach, Germany, where he was baptized five days later at the Hilsbach Reformed Church. He and his brother Leonhardt came from Germany by way of Rotterdam via Plymouth aboard the ship Dragon, arriving in Philadelphia in 1732. Peter took the oath of allegiance to the British Crown on September 30, 1732 in Philadelphia. He died on January 18, 1790 in Sharpsburg, Maryland, and is buried in the Old Reformed Churchyard there. His large tombstone still stands at the cemetery, and is written in German. Sometime after 1734, he married the former Maria Margaretha Waschenbach, who had been born in 1713 in Eichen, Germany. Joel and Catherine Schlosser Joel was first enumerated at the farm in the 1840 census, which was little more than a head count of persons living in the County. He is listed as the Head of Household, along with an indication that his wife was between the age of 20 and 30, along with two children, both under the age of 5. Joel had married the former Catherine Doub in Frederick, Maryland, on April 20, 1835, when she was about age 19. She had been born in Fredrick on January 4, 1816. Joel and Catherine had three children together eventually: Josiah, born about 1836; Enos, born on June 27, 1838; and Daniel, born on June 16, 1843. Daniel died less than a year later, on April 23, 1844. He is buried at the Mt. Hebron 1st U.B. Church in Eakle’s Mill, Maryland. Joel’s son Enos Schlosser married the former Mary Eleanor Hoover (born February 19, 1845) on January 4, 1866. They had a son Edward Thomas who was born on December 26, 1867. Enos acted as the executor of his father’s will in 1879, and later died on March 11, 1912. Joel’s eldest son Josiah continued to live with his parents and would eventually take ownership of the estate and operate the farm along with his own family. Joel and Catherine and son Josiah were enumerated at the farm in the 1870 census, which listed Joel as a retired farmer at the young age of 59. Catherine lied about her age, claiming that she was then age 43, when in fact she was 54. Son Josiah was then age 31 and single, indicating that he worked as a farmer. Joel listed the value of his real estate at an impressive $22,000, and the worth of his personal belongings as $1,000 ($322,000 today). Josiah listed a personal wealth of belongings as $1,200. The Schlosser’s also had a Caucasian domestic servant living with them on the farm named Sarah Derr, who was then age 19. A notice appeared in the January 17, 1866, edition of the Hagerstown Herald & Torch Light newspaper that mentioned Schlosser’s Fording, a low area across Antietam Creek adjacent to the farm where wagons could cross the riverbed. The state planned on building a bridge with two stone arches, both with a span of fifty feet that would carry an iron bridge far above the riverbed. The bridge was damaged in 1881, requiring residents to again traverse across the creek bed for a short time, as posted in a later edition of the newspaper. Joel Schlosser died on October 18, 1879, and was buried in the Boonsboro Cemetery. Just two years previous, his brother Samuel sold a farm close by known as the “Williams Farm” for $12,000 to an individual known as Nathaniel Mumma. A notice of the sale was reprinted from the Boonsboro’ Odd Fellow in the November 21, 1877, edition of the Hagerstown Herald & Torch Light newspaper. The 1880 census was enumerated at the farm, and listed Catherine as the head of the household; this time, she correctly stated her age of 64. The census revealed that her son Josiah had married sometime in the previous ten years to the former Savilla Doub, a close relative of his mother’s that was fourteen years his junior. She had been born in Maryland in December 1848. Catherine Schlosser died on March 16, 1890, at the age of 74, and was buried next to her husband Joel in the Boonsboro Cemetery. Joel and Catherine Schlosser's Descendants The 1890 census for the country was almost completely destroyed by a fire where it was being stored, before it could be copied, making it difficult to determine occupants of houses during that year. The next census taken at the farm was in 1900, which indicated that Josiah had died sometime between 1883 and 1900. His wife Savilla was listed as the Head of the Household, and working as a farmer as a 51-year-old widow. The 1900 census also revealed that Josiah and Savilla had four children together, three of whom were alive and living on the farm. They included: Minnie, born in August 1880; Harvey J., born November 2, 1881; and son Alvey D., born February 9, 1883. Both sons indicated they worked as laborers on the farm. Harvey Jonathon Schlessor registered for the World War I draft on September 12, 1918. His draft card listed his stature as medium height and build, with light blue eyes and light brown hair. His brother Alvey Daub Schlessor registered the same day, and was noted to be of short height with light brown eyes and dark brown hair. Josiah and Savilla’s three children remained single and at the farm during their lifetimes. Harvey was listed as the Head of Household beginning in the 1910 census, and would continue to be listed as such through the 1930 census, the last available for researchers. Minnie and Alvey would also continue to be listed at the form as single individuals through 1930, along with their mother Savilla, who died sometime after 1930. The family was joined by a single, 54-year-old Aunt named Carmelus Doub in 1910, who worked as a dressmaker in the house. The 1930 census revealed that the Schlosser’s enjoyed a radio in the farmhouse, one of the more unusual questions asked of the time. The three Schlosser children continued to live at the farm until 1973. Alvey had died on November 7, 1957, Minnie died in August 1973, and Harvey in February 1980. The Cranes Minnie and Harvey sold the house on March 30, 1973, to Clarence B. Crane after an approximately 140-year tenure by the Schlessor family. Crane had been born in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, on September 12, 1914, to Joseph and Teresa Crane, who were immigrants of Germany. He and wife Helene never lived on this farm having moved from Chevy Chase, MD. They purchased the existing farm directly across the Antietam Creek years before purchasing “Stoney Creek Farms”(a name applied much later). The Cranes originally only purchased “Stoney Creek Farms” to rent out land to neighboring farmers as the house stayed vacant for some time after. Some years after purchasing “Stoney Creek Farms”, in 1975, was given to Richard “Larry” Lawrence Crane after returning from seminary. The 4th of 8 children of Clarence and Helene Crane along with his first wife Carol Anne Crane, Ph.D. and their son Jason Lawrence Crane. Clarence died (lung cancer) in March 1982 on the other/original (not “Stoney Creek Farm” as previously mentioned) farm just across the Antietam Creek also referred as the Stone house which was built pre-revolutionary war. In fact Clarence and Helene never lived at this farm, Splitting their summers between Chesapeake Beach, MD and winters in the old stone house across the creek. Helene having transferred title to the farm to Richard Lawrence Crane who went by his middle name and was known only as “Larry” by everyone in Boonsboro, being a well liked and popular business man. Laurie Crane was his second wife and only inherited the farm upon his death. Laurie had little to do with either business or building the additions and remodeling efforts of the farm as these things were already started well before they married. Larry Crane operated a wholesale commercial nursery (he did not do any landscaping except his own) business on the property and a retail store in the town of Boonsboro, MD, both respectively know as “Mountainside Gardens” for over 20 years (opposed to the incorrect 9 years previously mentioned an authored in the original history). They were also responsible for the large addition on the rear of the house including the kitchen and the great room, as well as the office out building behind the garage and all services to other out buildings including the pig barn and horse/hay barn where he used to raise dairy stock for sale (this amends the error below stating it was done by a later owner). Larry also cleared the existing apple orchards to build his runway, airplane hanger, tractor barn and many of his wholesale green houses. Larry also did most of the remodeling and all landscaping by himself along with his son Jason and 4 brothers. Most of which have not been changed or altered to this day. Years later, on July 21, 1997, Larry was killed when he crashed his homemade Renegade Spirit aircraft on his sister Sally’s property also across the Antietam Creek. The FAA report stated, “Witnesses (his sister and her two small boys Kevin and Andrew Sayers from their kitchen window) watched as the pilot/owner maneuvered his homebuilt airplane at a low altitude. His sister Sally as there were no other witnesses except her extremely young children reported the engine sounded stopped or stalled before impact. The airplane's nose dropped down and it descended until ground impact and was destroyed during a post crash fire. His sister reported observing the airplane on numerous other occasions performing low level maneuvering. Larry performed these maneuvers especially for his sister who was wheelchair bound and could rarely leave the house or go flying with him. It was his way of saying hi. Examination of the airframe and engine did not reveal anomalies.” Edited by his only son Jason Lawrence Crane for sake of truth. The Schmidts Laurie Crane sold the farm to Mark and Kimberly Schmidt on July 24, 2000. The Schmidts installed electrical service and utilities to most of the buildings on the property, built the addition on the side of the bank barn, restored the spring house and raised its floor to prevent flooding, constructed the guest house, renovated the garage into an office and remodeled the hog barn to accommodate Kimberly’s desire to run a horse-boarding business on the farm. They also removed the greenhouses from the property, created several miles of riding trails and installed fencing and frame stables for the horses. They also built a secluded cabin in the woods overlooking the Hagerstown Valley. SCF, LLC Mark and Kimberly Schmidt sold the farm to Brandon Green, Joseph Farone, and David Kempton on October 31, 2004. It has been a bed and breakfast since the trio finished renovating it. Green, Farone, and Kempton formed SFC, LLC which now owns and operates Stoney Creek Farm. Since the purchase four and a half baths have been added and a fifth totally remodeled. The rooms have been painted, papered, sanded, and decorated trying to keep in mind the heritage of the home while trying to bring it into the 20th century. New appliances for the kitchen and a face lift to the cabinetry were needed. Much of the flooring throughout the house has been replaced, sanded, or reconditioned using as much material as possible from the farm, such as the wood planks on the floor of the dining room that were formally in the attic.

The station's studios and offices are located on Belfort Parkway in Jacksonville's Southside district.Easy1029.com/contact-us The transmitter is off Hogan Road in the Arlington neighborhood.Radio-Locator.com/WEZI-FM WEZI is a Class C FM station, running at an effective radiated power (ERP) of 100,000 watts, from a tower at 1,014 feet (309 m) in height above average terrain (HAAT). Its signal stretches from the Georgia coast to south of St. Augustine, Florida to southwest as far as Gainesville, Florida. History WIVY-FM On November 1, 1965, the station signed on as WIVY-FM.Broadcasting Yearbook 1967 page B-34 At first, it ran at 28,900 watts, less than a third of its current power. It was the sister station to AM 1050 WIVY, which was a daytimer, so the FM station allowed WIVY's programming to be heard around the clock. Both stations were owned by New York announcer Ed Bell Oberle. The following year the stations were sold to Alumni Radio, Inc. In 1971, the stations were acquired by another New York announcer, Tom Kirby, under the name Jacksonville Broadcasting.Broadcasting Yearbook 1973 page B-41 He saw FM stations in other cities starting rock formats so he hired a staff of young disc jockeys and switched both stations to album-oriented rock (AOR). (The AM station moved to 1280 kHz, but remained a daytime-only operation, simulcasting WIVY-FM.) Kirby sold WIVY-FM in 1976 to Torrid Broadcasting, a subsidiary of Progressive Communications.Broadcasting Yearbook 1980 page C-45 It flipped to Top 40 hits as \\"Y-103\\". In 1985, Gilmore Broadcasting bought the station, boosting the power to 100,000 watts, helping WIVY-FM better cover the expanding Jacksonville radio market.Broadcasting Yearbook 1987 page B-60 In 1988, J.J. Taylor Communications took over the station, moving the format a bit older to hot adult contemporary music, but still as Y-103.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1989 page B-62 WMXQ In 1998, Capstar purchased the station.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1999 page D-91 It kept the Hot AC format but changed its call sign to WMXQ, calling the station \\"Mix 103.\\" Capstar sold WMXQ to Cox Radio in 2000.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2002-2003 D-92 Cox switched the format to all-1980s music on November 1, 2000, calling the station \\"102.9 The Point\\". logo, 2009-2017 WXXJ On February 25, 2009, at 5:55 a.m. Cox flipped the format to alternative rock as \\"X102.9.\\" The last song on \\"102.9 The Point\\" was \\"Don't You (Forget About Me)\\" by Simple Minds (bookending the format, as it was the first song that launched \\"The Point\\"). The first song on X102.9 was \\"Chop Suey!\\" by System of a Down. The station was launched to compete with heritage modern rock station 107.3 WPLA (now mainstream rock WWJK). X102.9 changed its call letters to WXXJ on April 7, 2009. As WXXJ rose in the ratings, it began an offensive against its format rival. X102.9 flew a banner over Metropolitan Park during the last Planetfest and interfered with WPLA's annual \\"Easter Keg Hunt\\" by bribing people with $300 for the kegs. WPLA management called police to stop the activity. On August 4, 2010, WPLA ended its alternative rock format, switching to classic hits, changing to adult hits and eventually changing to Modern Rock again. This left WXXJ as the only modern rock station in Jacksonville. WEZI On November 20, 2017, WXXJ swapped formats and frequencies with its sister station at 106.5. The 100,000-watt signal at 102.9 became the new home of Soft AC station WEZI, while the 6,000-watt signal at 106.5 became the new home of Alternative Rock station WXXJ. At first, Easy 102.9 played all Christmas music but on December 26, 2017, the Soft AC format resumed on 102.9. Over time, Easy 102.9 has evolved into a more mainstream Adult Contemporary format phasing in more current songs only going as far back as the 1980's.X102.9 & Easy 106.5 Swap Frequencies In Jacksonville The two stations swapped call signs on November 26, 2017.

Early life and education Justine Cassell was born in New York City and attended Brooklyn's Saint Ann's School. She holds a DEUG in Lettres Modernes from the Université de Besançon (1981), a BA in Comparative Literature/Linguistics from Dartmouth College (1982), an M.LITT. in Linguistics from the University of Edinburgh (1986), and a double PhD in Linguistics and Developmental/Cognitive Psychology from the University of Chicago (1991) where she studied under David McNeill. Career As a tenured professor, Cassell was the director of the Gesture and Narrative Language Research Group at the MIT Media Lab. After leaving MIT, she became a full professor in the departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and Communication Studies at Northwestern University. There she was the founding director of Technology and Social Behavior Ph.D. program, and the interdisciplinary Center for Technology and Social Behavior. In 2001, Cassell received the Edgerton Faculty Award at MIT; in 2008 she received the Anita Borg Institute Women of Vision Award for Leadership; in 2009 Cassell was made an ACM Distinguished Lecturer. Cassell has authored more than 100 journal articles, conference proceedings and book chapters on these topics; she has given more than 50 keynote addresses at various conferences.Computing Research Association web site. In March 2016 she was elected a Corresponding Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, in recognition of her contributions to computer science and to human-computer interaction.https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/press/2016/The%20RSE%20welcomes%2056%20new%20Fellows.pdf Cassell's early work involved verbal and nonverbal aspects of human communication, into which she began introducing computational systems in order to deconstruct the linguistic and nonverbal communication to allow machines to interact with humans. Randal Bryant, Dean of Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science, commented on her appointment to the directorship of the Human Computer Interaction Institute that she would \\"expand the horizons of the institute.\\" The Institute studies how people communicate with and through technology.Carnegie Mellon's Human Computer Interaction Institute \\"Articulab\\" home page. Cassell has done work on \\"animated conversation,\\" designing a human figure animation that integrates gesture, intonation, and facial expression.Justine Cassell's description of her work at Public Broadcasting System web site, undated.Anna Salleh, Empathetic virtual humans on the way, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 5 December 2008.Katie Dean, It's a Virtual Revolution, People, Wired, May 18, 2000. She helped design a web-based storytelling system called \\"Renga, the Cyberstory\\" to help draw girls into new technology. During 1994-1995 she designed and coordinated workshops on survival skills for women in academia at the University of Pennsylvania and the Linguistic Society of America Summer Institute in Linguistics. She also has worked on research into what constitutes a \\"normal\\" career path in linguistics for women. A New York Times reviewer described the book From Barbie to Mortal Kombat: Gender and Computer Games (written with Henry Jenkins) as an \\"academic anthology about what women, or rather girls, want from computer games.\\" He writes that they \\"wisely\\" ask \\"why there have to be 'girl games' at all. After all, many games with tremendous appeal to women have no gender affiliation.\\"J.C.

Young people who use them are getting just as much practice in leadership and social skills and community involvement as they did before the Internet.\\"Scientists: Internet, Chat Rooms Good for Teenagers, Fox News, February 24, 2006. Commenting on why women were not more involved in computing careers, Cassell has commented that the creation of girls' games had not eliminated \\"the sense among both boys and girls that computers were 'boys' toys' and that true girls didn't play with computers.\\" Additionally, she has written that women do not want to be identified as a \\"nerd\\" or \\"geek.\\" Randall Stross, What Has Driven Women Out of Computer Science?, New York Times, November 15, 2008. Cassell is credited with developing the Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA), a virtual human which can interact with humans using language and gestures. The \\"virtual child\\" she created has helped children with autism develop advanced social skills not taught by association with real children or teachers.Teachers Outperform Real Ones, Fox News, February 21, 2008.Virtual reality aids children with autism, NBC News, April 21, 2008. Cassell contributed to a 2011 New York Times debate on \\"Where Are the Women in Wikipedia?\\" writing: \\"...Wikipedia may feel like a fight to get one's voice heard. One gets a sense of this insider view from looking at the 'talk page' of many articles, which rather than seeming like collaborations around the construction of knowledge, are full of descriptions of 'edit- warring' — where successive editors try to cancel each other's contributions out — and bitter, contentious arguments about the accuracy of conflicting points of view...However, it is still the case in American society that debate, contention, and vigorous defense of one's position is often still seen as a male stance, and women's use of these speech styles can call forth negative evaluations.\\"\\"A Culture of Editing Wars\\", one of four contributions to \\"Where Are the Women in Wikipedia?\\" debate, New York Times, February 2, 2011.

In addition to his appearances in the WWWF, Quinn performed under his birth name for North American regional promotions including NWA All-Star Wrestling, Pacific Northwest Wrestling and Stampede Wrestling from the early 1960s to early 1970s. During his later career, he also appeared in European and Japanese organizations from the 1970s until the late 1980s.

Issuing open challenges to British heavyweights, his match against Big Daddy proved especially popular as an estimated 10,000 were in attendance at the sold-out Wembley Arena in 1979. Quinn lasted 1 minute and 42 seconds before he was knocked out.Nagasaki, Kendo. The Grapple Manual: Heroes and Villains from the Golden Age of World Wrestling. London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2005. (pg. 57) In what was considered a major upset, Quinn would later go on to win the British World Heavyweight Championship defeating Wayne Bridges in London, England on April 21, 1980. Although his victory was intended to set up a feud with Bridges over the title, Quinn jumped to the rival All Star Wrestling while still champion, although Bridges was later awarded a splinter version of the title after defeating Big Jim Harris at Wembley Arena in 1981. Quinn defeated numerous British wrestlers including World Heavy Middleweight Champion Mark Rocco, British Mid-heavyweight Champion Chic Cullen and World Lightweight Champion Johnny Saint,. One title defence against Giant Haystacks in Claremorris, County Mayo, Republic of Ireland during this period was publicised with a contract signing ceremony on RTÉ television show Davis at Large. He would eventually lose the World heavyweight title to Tony St. Clair in Hanley, England on May 8, 1982. When Wayne Bridges also left for All Star Wrestling in 1983, he and Quinn would resume their feud over the British World Heavyweight title which would also involve Tony St. Clair whom Quinn eventually defeated for the title in Slough, England on February 13, 1984. Also in 1984 John Quinn competed in Puerto Rico for the World Wrestling Council In 1984, Quinn competed in the 1984 IWGP League finishing with 10 points. The following month, Quinn would also tour Japan taking part in several interpromotional matches with All Japan Pro Wrestling and the World Wrestling Federation with he and Otto Wanz fighting Yoshiaki Yatsu & Animal Hamaguchi to a double count-out in Fukuoka, Japan on May 11. Losing to Tatsumi Fujinami, Seiji Sakaguchi and André the Giant during the next several days, he would defeat Yoshiaki Fujiwara in Kumamoto, Japan on May 15 and, the following night in Saga, he and \\"Big\\" John Studd defeated Yoshiaki Yatsu & Isamu Teranishi. He would also team with WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan and The Masked Superstar in a 6-man tag team match losing to Tatsumi Fujinami, Seigi Sakaguchi and Antonio Inoki in Nagasaki, Japan on May 17. After defeating Kuniaki Kobayashi in Hiroshima, Japan on the last night of the tour, Quinn returned to Great Britain to resume his feud with Bridges and St. Clair. During the next two years, Quinn would win the British World Heavyweight Championship two more times from Tony St. Clair before losing the title for a fourth and final time to Wayne Bridges on September 9, 1986. Quinn was working for All Star Wrestling in Britain when it was televised on Screensport in 1985-1986 and again when the promotion gained a slice of ITV coverage in 1987 and he returned to TV appearing on both shows. His fourth and final World Heavyweight title win over StClair in Hanley in early 1986 was broadcast on the Screensport show and on ITV he fought Bridges once again and teamed with legendary masked wrestler Kendo Nagasaki. He also appeared on Welsh language channel S4C's Reslo wrestling show organised by veteran Welsh promoter Orig Williams, during this period. However, due in part to business disagreements with British promoters, as well as the loss of the ITV show in December 1988, Quinn returned to British Columbia in 1988 where he rejoined the similarly-named NWA All Star Wrestling for a time although he would leave the promotion over a pay dispute with promoter Al Tomko and retired shortly after wrestling his final match against Danny Biback in Cloverdale, British Columbia. Retirement In the years after his retirement, Quinn worked in a variety of jobs ranging from a laborer, taxi driver, and truck driver to hotel and restaurant ownership. At one point, Quinn was in ill health however he would eventually recover. Remaining uninvolved in professional wrestling for almost 20 years, Quinn made an appearance at Twister's Gym at the Abbotsford Agri-fair hosted by Top Ranked Wrestling in July 2005. During the event, a tribute show was held in Quinn's honor and he was presented a plaque by the organizers. Personal life Quinn was the cousin of Pat Quinn, former head coach of the Toronto Maple Leafs. Quinn died in Vancouver at the age of 77 due to complications from a stroke after a surgery on April 22, 2019.http://www.lifenews.ca/announcement/9298895-quinn-john-arthur Championships and accomplishments *International Wrestling Enterprise **IWA World Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Kurt Von Hess *Joint Promotions **World Heavyweight Championship (4 times) *NWA All Star Wrestling **NWA Canadian Tag Team Championship (9 times) - with Bob Brown (4 times), Dutch Savage (1 time), Gerry Romano (1 time), Kinji Shibuya (1 time), Kurt Von Hess (1 time) and Don Leo Jonathan (1 time) **NWA Pacific Coast Heavyweight Championship (2 times) *NWA Tri-State **NWA Brass Knuckles Championship (1 times) **NWA Mid-South North American Championship (1 times) *Pro Wrestling Illustrated **PWI ranked him # 192 of the 400 best singles wrestlers of the PWI's WWE Top 400 in 2003 *Stampede Wrestling **Stampede International Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Mr. Hito **Stampede North American Heavyweight Championship (3 times) *Superstar Championship Wrestling **SCW Western States Championship (1 time) **SCW Western States Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Paddy Ryan References External links 1941 births 2019 deaths Canadian male professional wrestlers Professional wrestlers from Hamilton, Ontario Stampede Wrestling alumni ","title":"John Quinn (wrestler)"},{"id":"14459318","text":"Jack Clift (born September 15, 1955, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma) is an American Composer and Music Producer. He is best known for his hybrid soundscapes combining elements of American folk music, jazz and bluegrass music with traditional instruments and singers from the many countries he has visited. Clift's recordings feature virtuoso performances from Sardegna, Turkey, Corsica, Malta, and most notably Uzbekistan where he has been a part- time resident since 2004. That was when he co-founded the American-Uzbek musical group, Jadoo. Jadoo's members are Toir Kuziev, Utkur Kadirov, Otanazar Khudaynazarov, Olim Khakimov, Nodir Umarov, Abdulakhad Abdrashidov, Matrasul Matyokubov, Gulom Mukhamedjanov and other musical contributors. Clift has had compositions licensed by ABC for the 1996 Summer Olympics (\\"Guitarland\\", title track of Los Angeles guitarist Tim Pierce's solo album) and the nationally syndicated radio program, Car Talk (\\"Borrowed Car\\", co-written with Tom Adler and title track of Adler's CD). In September 2006, Clift met with John Carter Cash in Hendersonville, Tennessee where the two conceived an ambitious project melding the Central Asian influences of Jadoo with traditional American Mountain Music, including songs from the catalogue of the Carter Family. Clift then returned to Tashkent, Uzbekistan and met with Tatar guitarist Enver İzmaylov and the members of Jadoo for the first recording sessions of the project. Upon his return to the United States, he reconvened with Cash in Tennessee to begin introducing the contributions of mountain singer Ralph Stanley, recipient of the National Medal of Arts in 2006, country music icon Marty Stuart, The Peasall Sisters (O Brother, Where Art Thou?, Down from the Mountain), Randy Scruggs, Ronnie McCoury, John Cowan, Greg Leisz, and Ron Miles, thus forming the group Cedar Hill Refugees. This project, titled Pale Imperfect Diamond had a limited release in 2009. \\"Keys to the Kingdom\\", featuring Ralph Stanley, was chosen to be the first track on Coal Country Music, a compilation produced by Andy Mahler and Jason Wilber as a companion to the Sierra Club film Coal Country. A second Jadoo album, And Darkling Waters Flow, was also released in 2009. This beat-oriented instrumental album features the guitar work of longtime collaborator Tim Pierce. In June 2009, Clift was invited to perform with Jadoo for an episode of PBS travel series Rudy Maxa's World, working with travel guru Rudy Maxa and Emmy award-winning director Sue McNally. Jadoo not only performs live, but selections from various Jadoo CDs are featured prominently throughout the episode. Continuing this collaboration, Clift, Maxa, and McNally have begun developing a concert documentary that will bring the musicians of these two great traditions together for a concert. 2009 also brought the online pre-release of Horses Fleet as Wind, a collection of live studio improvisations featuring Jadoo with special guests Enver İzmaylov, and Vitaliy Papelov. This title is currently available only as a download from the Effigy Records website but rumors of a pending packaged commercial release persist. Cedar Hill Refugees perform in the Registan, Samarkand, Uzbekistan at Sharq Taronalari Festival 2013. In 2013 Clift led a group of American musicians – Anna & Elizabeth and Brad Houser (Edie Brickell & New Bohemians) – to represent the United States in the Sharq Taronalari music festival in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. The third Jadoo album entitled Danza Tigresa was completed in 2016 and was coproduced by longtime Clift associate, drummer and photographer, Dony Wynn (Robert Palmer, Chaka Khan, Robert Plant, Brooks & Dunn). The album was mixed by engineer, Jason Corsaro, 1959-2017 (David Bowie, Peter Gabriel, Madonna, Moby, Rolling Stones) in Lake Hopatcong, NJ, and includes a cover of the song Cheyah by Australian Electronic Music composer/producer, Mr Bill, adapted for Clift’s Uzbek/American ensemble. Currently, Clift and John Carter Cash are in the production of the Cedar Hill Refugees album featuring Ralph Stanley, The Peasall Sisters, Marty Stuart, Bill Miller (musician), Jeff Taylor, Rebekah Del Rio, Ana Cristina and John Cowan are again featured as well as several new guest collaborators: Jerry Douglas, Bela Fleck, Rosanne Cash, Sam Bush, bluegrass singer Dave Evans (bluegrass) and acclaimed Virginia traditional singer, Elizabeth LaPrelle.

Overview It chronicles the time, about a year, that she spent in the labs of two very prominent cancer biologists, Robert Weinberg and Michael Wigler, during a period where there was a race to discover and characterize some of the first cancer causing and cancer-suppressing genes (oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, respectively). This book gives insight into the day-to-day working of a top scientific laboratory with no embellishment - both the excitement and thrill of discovery as well as the drudgery and politics can be found in Natural Obsessions. Pressure to find these genes mounts and everyone is scrambling to be the first to announce this major discovery which could have gone to several laboratories. Commercial and critical reception Natural Obsessions was reviewed favorably in the New York Times and Smithsonian magazine in the months after its initial publication. The book was named a New York Times Notable Book for 1988. As of 2001, the book has been used as a text in a cancer biology course at the University of Chicago and the University of Houston.

As of the 2019 season, the teams have played 100 times. Penn State has not played more games against any other opponent, whereas Pitt has only played more against West Virginia University. After the rivalry resumed in 2016, it was branded \\"The Keystone Classic\\" with Peoples Natural Gas as its corporate sponsor.http://www.gopsusports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/082616aaa.html Penn State won 12 of the first 15, but Pitt dominated afterwards, going 21-2–2 (1913–40). Pitt at one point won 14 straight times (1922–38). Pitt coach Jock Sutherland never lost to Penn State (1924–38). From 1941 to 1951, the rivalry was much more even, as Pitt went 6–5 against Penn State in that span. From 1960 on, Penn State has dominated, going 30–10–1, including wins in ten of the last twelve games. Former Penn State coach Joe Paterno went 23–7–1 against Pitt (1966–92, 1997–2000). Series history Pitt versus Penn State at Pitt Stadium on November 27, 1958 Once considered one of the most important college football rivalries north of the Mason–Dixon line, this intrastate rivalry was deemed the biggest annual game for both schools for a large part of their histories. The game often had regional and national implications with the winner often claiming Eastern college football supremacy and its respective Lambert-Meadowlands Trophy. The first game was played on November 6, 1893, in State College, PA, with Penn State prevailing 32–0. Penn State won the first six meetings. This was also the first game to be played in Old Beaver Field. Pitt's first victory in the series occurred on November 24, 1904, in Pittsburgh, 22–5. The 1963 game was originally scheduled for Saturday, November 23, but was postponed to December 7 following the assassination of John F. Kennedy the day before. The once-beaten Panthers were being touted as a possible Cotton Bowl participant, but the bowl representatives expressed desire to invite Pitt only if they had one loss. With the game postponed until December 7, the Cotton Bowl could not wait. Pitt beat Penn State 22–21, finishing the season 9–1, with no bowl. The 1976 game pitted undefeated Pitt, ranked number one in the nation, against Penn State at Three Rivers Stadium on the night after Thanksgiving, November 26. The score was tied 7–7 at the half. Pitt's coach Johnny Majors moved Tony Dorsett to fullback for the second half, and the Panthers went on to win 24–7, finishing the regular season 11–0, on their way to a Sugar Bowl victory over Georgia and their first National Championship in 39 years. 1998 game at Pitt Stadium The 1981 game was one for the ages. Pitt was once again undefeated at 10–0 and number one in the nation, ready to claim the title, \\"Beast of the East\\". The Nittany Lions had other ideas when they came to Pitt Stadium on November 28. The game featured two junior quarterbacks, Dan Marino for Pitt and Todd Blackledge for Penn State. Pitt went up 14–0 in the first quarter; Penn State tied it at 14 at the half. The second half belonged to Penn State, scoring 34 second-half points while holding the Panthers scoreless. The 48–14 final cost Pitt a chance for its second national title in five years. The 1982 game again featured two of the nation's best teams. Pitt had been ranked preseason #1, but had lost to Notre Dame to enter the game at 9–1. Penn State also entered the game 9–1, having lost only to Alabama. Again, it would be Marino vs. Blackledge in their last regular season game at a windswept Beaver Stadium. Penn State prevailed 19–10 on the strength of one Blackledge touchdown pass to Kenny Jackson, four field goals and a tenacious defense, and was on its way to a Sugar Bowl upset of Georgia, earning its first National Championship. The rivalry began a slow death in the 1990s when both schools left the ranks of college football independents and chose to join different conferences. Penn State accepted an invitation to join the Big Ten Conference while Pitt's football program joined the Big East Conference (who had rejected Penn State's application to join by a single vote in 1982) where the majority of the school's athletic programs already participated. The conference affiliations of the two previously independent football programs resulted in fewer scheduling opportunities. The last game prior to the series hiatus was played at Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on September 16, 2000, when Pitt shut out Penn State 12–0. The desire of the Penn State Athletic Department to host an unbalanced number of home games (proposing 2–1 and 3–2 series) at Beaver Stadium was a significant factor in not agreeing to renew the series. The basis for this request stemmed from the fact that of the 96 games played by the two teams at the time, only 23 occurred in Happy Valley. During the years the rivalry was dormant, both schools went through a major transformation. At Pitt, the school's basketball program became more prominent at the expense of the football team, seen most notably by the placement of the Petersen Events Center in the footprint of old Pitt Stadium. While the football team's attendance remained comparable after moving to Heinz Field in 2001 (almost 45,500 at Pitt Stadium in its final years and almost 42,000 at Heinz Field), it often appears empty due to the venue's much higher capacity (56,500 at Pitt Stadium and 68,400 at Heinz Field). This became more pronounced after Pitt joined the Atlantic Coast Conference and especially after West Virginia University joined the Big 12 Conference, also putting the Backyard Brawl on hold. Since moving to Heinz Field, years Pitt hosted the Backyard Brawl were among the few times Pitt filled Heinz Field, mostly due to the influx of WVU fans making the 70-mile trip up Interstate 79 from Morgantown, West Virginia and other parts of the state in addition to the large amount of WVU alumni in Western Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, the Penn State child sex abuse scandal was made public, leading to Pitt fans to chant \\"Joe Knew\\" as a reference to longtime head coach Joe Paterno allegedly knowing about the allegations but not reporting it to police. This, as well as other general insults, has gained some controversy among sports fans, including Pitt students and alumni. The rivalry was renewed after 16 years of dormancy for the 2016 season under the Keystone Classic moniker. This game was the first of a four-game series from 2016–19, with the teams playing at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh in 2016 and 2018, while battling at Beaver Stadium in State College in 2017 and 2019. In 2016, Pitt went up 28–7 during the second quarter. Penn State rallied back during the second half, but was still down 42–39 late in the fourth quarter. In the final minutes, the Nittany Lions drove the ball almost within field goal range before going for a deep pass in the end zone. Quarterback Trace McSorley's pass was intercepted, effectively ending the game. The loss was cited as a key reason the Nittany Lions failed to make the College Football Playoff. This game became the largest attended sporting event in the history of the city of Pittsburgh. In 2017, Penn State won by a score of 33–14. After going up early off the back of an opening-drive interception, the Nittany Lions never surrendered the lead. The recorded attendance was 109,898, the tenth largest (seventh largest at that time) ever at Beaver Stadium and the largest since 2009. This was also the largest crowd to ever attend a game in the series. The renewal has been highly successful, showcasing competitive games and setting major attendance records in its first two years. In late April 2018, Pitt athletic director, Heather Lyke, was reported to have sent a proposal to her Penn State counterpart, Sandy Barbour, regarding a four-game series renewal in 2026. This would come after much discussion between both universities and athletic directors. As the Nittany Lions have yet to fill their non-conference Power Five slot for that season, this would be the first opportunity for the two to play again. However, a couple weeks later in May, Barbour stated that she had yet to sign the proposal, calling non-conference scheduling a “complicated puzzle.” Because of the Big Ten's nine conference games requirement, Penn State has a smaller degree of flexibility for scheduling compared to Pitt, as the ACC only has an eight conference game schedule. Barbour went on to say that both she and Lyke had agreed that the universities were unlikely to do something presently and that they were looking at post-2030 for a series renewal. The 2018 game in Pittsburgh had long been rumored to be a nationally televised, prime time, night game. This was further supported when the Pittsburgh Pirates of the MLB changed the start time of their game at PNC Park on September 8 from 7:05 p.m. to 1:05 p.m. On May 16, Pitt and Penn State announced that the game would officially be played at night. In the rain and wind caused by the wake of Tropical Storm Gordon, Penn State prevailed 51–6. This was the first night game in the series since 1987. In a game only fitting for their 100th meeting, Pitt and Penn State exchanged scores in the first half after a delay due to severe weather. After the Nittany Lions struck first with a touchdown in the first quarter, the Panthers answered with ten points in the second. In the waning seconds of the half, Penn State drove the ball into enemy territory and within field goal range. However, a sack by Pitt moved them back considerably to bring up fourth and long. With little chance of converting, the Nittany Lions elected to attempt a school record 57-yard field goal. Kicker Jordan Stout punched it through the middle of the uprights to tie the game going into halftime, breaking the record. The second half was marked with both big offensive breaks and strong defensive stands. Penn State notched the sole score of the third quarter to go up 17-10. However, after converting on multiple fourth downs and third and longs, the Panthers threatened to tie the game up late in the fourth quarter. With less than six and a half minutes remaining in the game, Pitt converted on 2nd and 19 to get the ball to the Penn State 1 yardline, almost scoring in the process. The Nittany Lions would hold the line and force 4th and 1 with less than five minutes left in the game. Pitt's head coach, Pat Narduzzi, controversially elected to attempt a 19-yard field goal. Kicker Alex Kessman, who had set a school record four 50+ yard field goals the season prior, kicked the ball off the left upright of the goalpost. The Panther's defense would hold up the Nittany Lions on the ensuing drive once again, forcing them to punt and giving their offense one last chance to score. After starting on their own 16 yardline, Pitt drove the ball deep into enemy territory. After gaining a first down in the last few seconds, there was confusion over the game clock, which failed to stop for the ball to be set after the conversion. The clock would run out to 0, leading the Nittany Lions and most of Beaver Stadium to think the game was over. The officials were then forced to clear the teams off the field and back onto the sidelines, announcing the error over the speakers and asking for five seconds back on the clock. This would become six seconds, and later nine, after further review, leaving a confused crowd on the edge of their seats for one last play in regulation. Kenny Pickett's pass would fall incomplete, ending the game and the renewed series (for the time being) with a 17-10 Penn State victory.

The plot concerns the first, trying assignment for a young, idealistic teacher. Tad Mosel wrote the screenplay adaptation of the novel of the same name by Bel Kaufman. Plot The film's title is a reference to the staircases inside a public, overcrowded New York City high school of 3,000 students, many of them troubled. Sylvia Barrett, fresh out of graduate school, has just been hired to teach English to the teens in this place, who come from various races and ethnicities. Many are undisciplined; a few are hanging with gangs. She is disheartened that she came to teach but finds that her time seems burdened with the school's required regulations, daily reporting and other paperwork. Her students also seem continually disruptive and playful. Student Alice has a crush on a male teacher and narrowly avoids death after jumping out a school window; Student Linda gets a black eye from her father. Student Joe is on court probation, with a high I.Q. but a mixed academic record, testing her patience; student Roy works nights and falls asleep in class. Not everyone is agreeable with Sylvia's quiet approach to the situation, but she intends to get the teens to become good students and get them into real learning. She succeeds finally in getting them into a lively discussion about classic literature (comparing \\"the best of times ... the worst of times\\" to their own lives), followed by a lively mock trial, before weighing whether to continue or resign from her position.

This was her first and only film with producer Alan J. Pakula and director Robert Mulligan. The film also featured early appearances from Bud Cort and Jean Stapleton. The film was entered into the 5th Moscow International Film Festival where Sandy Dennis won the award for Best Actress. Outdoor street scenes were filmed on 1st Avenue and 100th Street in East Harlem. The outdoor school scenes were filmed on the same block, at Junior High School 99 at 410 East 100th Street (now the Renaissance Charter High School for Innovation). Some indoor school and classroom scenes were filmed at the former Haaren HS on 59th St and 10th Ave (today's John Jay College of Criminal Justice), and a production studio in Chelsea. The actors portraying the students were non-professionals, and most were themselves high school students. Jeff Howard, 20 years old, was a Long Island University student. Jose Rodriguez, playing the quiet student who blossoms during the trial sequence, was a 17-year-old student at the New York School of Printing, now the High School of Graphic Communication Arts. Ellen O'Mara, who plays a love-struck student, was also 17 and attended Washington Irving High School. Salvatore Rasa, playing the student body president of the fictional high school, was 17 and had that role in real life at Bishop Ford High School.

By 2002 the first NetDisk (up to 80 GB) was marketed as a low cost alternative to full computer based network storage options. The Ximeta company was founded in 2003. In 2004 Kim applied for a patent to allow multiple clients write access to the shared block storage device.System using a single host to receive and redirect all file access commands for shared data storage device from other hosts on a network . by Han-gyoo Kim, Filed September 27, 2004, granted November 25, 2008. By 2006, sizes up to 500 GB were supported. In 2008 an NDAS device called \\"ShareDisk Gigabit\\" created by Co-World Cs in Germany briefly claimed the title of world's fastest network storage device. In 2011 IOCELL Networks announced ownership of the NDAS system and NetDisk patents.  Benefits  * Hardware is typically easy to set up and use, particularly when a unit is purchased with a disk installed. * The disk drive can be used via multiple interfaces (typically eSATA, USB or Ethernet) though not concurrently: USB and eSATA allow access by only one host. * The disks do not require special formatting so they can be treated as external disks on a wide variety of computers. * Performance (speed vs. cost) is claimed to be better than similarly priced storage devices. * Devices are isolated from external network discovery since the protocol is not visible through a router.  Drawbacks  Linux Driver Project Code - chunk of GPL code from the NDAS driver * The LPX Protocol is not routable, thus limiting access to one local area network. * Some firewall programs block the LPX protocol by default. It uses EtherType value 0x88AD. * Drivers required to operate NDAS devices over a network are not shipped with operating systems. The devices are usually accompanied with client driver software for Microsoft Windows operating systems. * Drivers for Linux-based operating systems (Linux distributions such as Fedora, Ubuntu or Debian) are available only from the manufacturer. The Linux connection package does have a shared read and write access mode. However it must be used with a multi-client file system. An open source management interface was made available for Linux in 2009. A similar protocol is ATA over Ethernet.

Biography His film career began as a cameraman. Among his first jobs were three films on which Mihály Kertész (later Michael Curtiz) carried out the production design for the Vienna-based Sascha-Film: an Arthur Schnitzler adaptation Der junge Medardus (1923), the romance Fiaker Nr. 13 and the artist's life Der goldene Schmetterling (both 1926). Later he worked with such different directors as Carl Wilhelm, Ernő Metzner, Gustav Ucicky and Max Nosseck. After the switch to sound film he was engaged by the German industry leader Universum Film AG (Ufa) as a film editor (cutter). Eduard von Borsody thereafter often worked under Ucicky's direction and edited for him, among many other films, the National Socialist propaganda films Morgenrot and Flüchtlinge. In 1937, after some experience as assistant director, also with Ucicky, and a series of short dramas, he directed his first film for Ufa: Brillanten (\\"Diamonds\\"). ' (1938), with René Deltgen and Gustav Diessl, was an adventure film about the real-life English explorer, Henry Wickham, who in 1876 smuggled rubber seeds to England in order to break Brazil's rubber monopoly. Sensationsprozeß Casilla (1939) was about a child abduction. With Kongo-Express (also in 1939) Borsody again shot an adventure film in a tropical setting in an attempt to capitalise on the success of Kautschuk. Willy Birgel, Marianne Hoppe and René Deltgen starred. Once World War II began, light cheerful escapist films were much in demand, and von Borsody was cinematographer for the romantic musical drama Wunschkonzert (\\"Request Concert\\"), one of the most successful films of the entire Nazi period. Ilse Werner plays a young Berliner, who patiently and trustingly awaits the return of the man to whom she is engaged, played by Carl Raddatz, ordered on a secret mission to Spain. The film was classified as \\"politically valuable\\", \\"artistically valuable\\", \\"valuable for the people\\".\\"Volkstümlich wertvoll\\" and \\"valuable for youth\\", and took 7.6 million Reichsmarks. The science fiction film Weltraumschiff 18 (i.e. Spaceship 18), Provides a movie poster. which he directed and had already begun filming had to be abandoned because of the outbreak of the war. Material was used in the short science-fiction movie, Weltraumschiff 1 startet (Spaceship 1 takes off). The last film Borsody shot before the end of the war, the Gottfried Keller adaptation Jugendliebe fell afoul of the film censors and did not open until 1947. After the end of the war Borsody had no trouble continuing his film career despite his previous involvement in propaganda films. After a number of Heimatfilme came his best-known post-war film, the romantic comedy of 1956 Dany, bitte schreiben Sie (\\"Dany, Please Write!\\"), with Sonja Ziemann and Rudolf Prack, and the smuggling film Liane, das Mädchen aus dem Urwald, with which he returned to the exotic. His next film, Skandal um Dodo (1958), was one of the first post-war films in German to star a black woman. His 1965 film Bergwind was entered into the 4th Moscow International Film Festival. Family Von Borsody was the father of actor Hans von Borsody. He was the younger brother of set designer Julius von Borsody. His granddaughter, Suzanne von Borsody, is a German actress.

He specialised in backstroke and individual medley events. He is a three-time world champion and a four-time Commonwealth Games gold medallist, and held the world record in the 50-metre backstroke (long course) for almost a decade. Early life Born on 7 May 1985, his first experience of swimming was waiting poolside while his older brother was learning to swim at a swimming school. Tancock was competing in local swimming competitions by the age of nine. Tancock played for Exeter Chiefs rugby team as a winger until he was thirteen. His coach, Jon Randall, convinced him to choose swimming over rugby. He attended Loughborough College where he studied sports science and was awarded with a degree validated by Loughborough University. Swimming career 2000 As a junior for the Exeter Swimming Club, he competed at the British Winter Championship in 2000 at the age of 15. He broke four records and won more medals than any junior under the age of 16 had before him. 2001 He followed this with a gold medal at the 2001 Youth Olympic Games. 2002 Two golds in 2002 at the World Schools Championships. 2005 He competed at a senior level for the first time in 2005 at the 2005 World Aquatic Championships, where he took the bronze medal in the 50m backstroke. 2007 At the Japan International Open in August 2007, he won two gold medals. The first was in the 100m backstroke, which broke the European record time, and his second was in the 200m individual medley with a time of 1:59.19, which was only the second time he had finished with a time of under two minutes. It was a new British record, beating the previous record by a second and a half. 2008 Tancock won several medals at the 2008 World Short Course Championships in Manchester, including a British, European and Commonwealth record time of 50:14 to take the gold medal in the 100m backstroke. The time was only 0.14 seconds off the world record set by American Ryan Lochte. He also won silver in the 50m backstroke and 200m medley. Competing at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing in the men's 100m backstroke, Tancock finished in sixth position with a time of 53.39, some 0.21 seconds behind the bronze medal position. He also competed in the 200m individual medley, finishing in 8th place with a time of 2:00.76. His preferred event, the 50m backstroke, is not an Olympic event. Tancock said of the lack of a 50m event, \\"There is a 50m at every other major competition bar the Olympics. Don’t ask me why, but it never has been. It is not an issue but, of course, I would like it to be there\\". 2009 He broke his own world record winning the gold medal for 50m backstroke at the 2009 World Aquatics Championships. He had set a time of 24.08 in the semi finals, but improved it with a time of 24.04 in the final. It was the second gold of the event for the British team, who took home their best ever tally of seven medals in total. He wore a bodyskin swimsuit which was subsequently banned by FINA at the start of 2010. 2010 In the 50m backstroke event at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, he took the gold medal once more, breaking the Commonwealth Games record with a time of 24.62 in the final. He also took a second Commonwealth gold in the 100m backstroke with a time of 53.59. As of 2010, he was ranked second in the world for the 50m backstroke and third for the 100m, and following his success at the Commonwealth Games he was named BBC South West's Sportsman of the Year 2010. The interior of the London Aquatics Centre, where Tancock qualified for the Olympics and competed during the 2012 Games 2011 At the 2011 World Aquatics Championships in Shanghai, Tancock retained his world championship crown with a time of 24.5 seconds in the 50m backstroke. It was the second occasion a British male swimmer had retained a world championship title, and he became the first man to retain the 50m backstroke title. He finished sixth in the 100m backstroke with a time of 52.76. 2012 On 5 March 2012, Tancock won the 100m backstroke final at the British trials with a time of 53.16 seconds in the event held at the London Aquatics Centre. The victory qualified him for the 2012 Summer Olympics as part of the British team as the top two of each race qualified automatically. Whilst competing at the venue, which was the swimming venue at the 2012 Games, he did not find the controversial ceiling and lighting set up distracting, putting it down to the training he conducted for the 2009 World Championships, which were held outside. As part of his training regime for the Games, he took up ballet, kickboxing and rock climbing in order to improve on his position of sixth at the 2008 Games. He also pushed around his coach's car in order to improve his stamina and transfer his 50m backstroke form to the 100m event. Despite this, Tancock missed out on a medal as he finished fifth in the men's 100m backstroke final in a time of 53.35 seconds.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/swimming/9439619/London-2012-Olympics- Liam-Tancock-misses-out-on-medal-as-he-finishes-fifth-in-mens-100m-backstroke- final.html He was also part of the Great Britain team that finished fourth in the 4 × 100 m medley relay, where they finished 32 milliseconds behind the Australian team in third. He has no plans to retire and does not believe that the 2012 Games will be his last Olympics. 2013 Tancock achieved the World Championships qualifying time, but the team coach only choose swimmers who had a chance of being at Rio 2016. As a result of the 50m backstroke not being an event at the Olympics, Tancock was not selected for the team. 2014 At the 2014 Commonwealth Games, Tancock won bronze medals in the men's 50 metre backstroke and the 100 metre backstroke and helped England to win the 4 x 100 metre medley. 2015 At the age of 30, Tancock qualified for the final of the 100m backstroke at the World Aquatics Championships in a time of 53.19.  2016  Personal bests and records held ;Long course (50 m) ;Short course (25 m) Personal life Liam is the younger of 2 boys born for mum Kim; his brother is 2 years older.

Informational interviews are often casual and candid conversations where both parties are focused simply on acquiring and sharing knowledge. They can also be formal if the knowledge seeker is a job seeker and the knowledge provider is a potential employer whose goal is not only to provide information to the job seeker, but also to learn about the job seeker and judge their professional potential and corporate fit. Knowledge seekers use informational interviews to gather information on an industry and on specific companies where they might want to work, explore career paths, uncover job opportunities, and expand their professional network. Knowledge providers use informational interviews to share their knowledge and lend a helping hand, expand their professional network and meet potential employees and business partners. Informational interviews differ from job interviews because the conversation is not about hiring and not about a specific job. The knowledge seeker asks general questions about an industry, company or career path, and the knowledge provider has an opportunity to learn about the knowledge seeker's character and qualifications outside of a formal job interview process. Thus, informational interviews help overcome a problem in recruiting/job-seeking processes, where each side may be hesitant to talk to the other because they are uncertain about whether they might be wasting their time with an unqualified candidate or unsuitable workplace. Informational interviews provide an \\"non-threatening forum\\" for discussion as the two sides learn about each other. The term was coined by Richard Nelson Bolles, author of the best-selling career handbook What Color Is Your Parachute?. Sources of Informational Interviews Sources of informational interviews include a knowledge seeker's friends and family, school alumni, fellow members of a community, social, non-profit or religious organization, former co-workers, partners and clients, professional acquaintances, even total strangers, including industry leaders. Career advisors, coaches, teachers and recruiters can help connect knowledge seekers to other sources. Professional and social networking platforms are often used by knowledge seekers to identify and reach out to knowledge providers. These sites include LinkedIn and KIP101, a new platform launched in 2020 that focuses on connecting people for informational interviews. Etiquette for Informational Interviews When the job seeker initiates the interview, the professional being interviewed is doing a favor by providing information. It is important to be mindful of guidelines of informational interview etiquette, in addition to etiquette for traditional interviews. As for any interview, the potential candidate should learn in advance about the industry, the company and the individual. The time allowed is often short (15-20 minutes).

Women's sections in mainstream newspapers and women's newspapers provided a needed avenue for the dissemination of information and discussion of current concerns from and for women. The same is true for other minority newspapers, like the many African-American newspapers that covered human rights violations, oppression, and the beginnings of the Civil Rights Movement, before mainstream newspapers offered regular or even- handed coverage.

Opened in 2003, it is one of North Carolina's newest state parks. Elk Knob State Park was established to preserve the natural state of Elk Knob, the second highest peak in Watauga County. The park is open for year-round recreation and is currently undergoing an expansion of facilities to provide greater recreational opportunities to visitors. Elk Knob State Park is on Meat Camp Road, 5.5 miles (8.9 km) from North Carolina Highway 194, 9.5 miles (15.3 km) north of Boone, in the Blue Ridge Mountains. History Elk Knob State Park is named for Elk Knob, the second highest peak in Watauga County, which was under threat of being developed for summer homes during the late 1990s and early 2000s. A group of concerned citizens, led by the Nature Conservancy and land owners, teamed together to purchase Elk Knob and deed it to the State of North Carolina as a nature preserve, and later a state park. Elk Knob is an amphibolite peak and is home to the headwaters of the North Fork New River, a tributary of the New River, one of the oldest rivers in the world. Elk Knob State Park is surrounded by several historic mountain communities. Meat Camp, Pottertown and Sutherland were once, according to Dr. Patricia Beaver of Appalachian State University, \\"bustling, dynamic communities\\". Meat Camp was the location of Winebarger Grist Mill, which operated from the 1850s until 2005. Sutherland had a thriving cattle industry. Each community had at least one general store, post office, school and church. Faculty and students from Appalachian State have begun a process of preserving the history of the communities by hosting periodic community days, at Elk Knob State Park, where residents of the shrinking communities gather to pass down their history and share photos of earlier days. These gatherings have also given the students and young people of the region a chance to learn about sustainable agriculture practices that were commonplace throughout the history of Elk Knob. Ecology Elk Knob State Park's location atop an amphibolite peak has made it a vitally important and ecologically unique area. Amphibolite is a dark metamorphic rock which is rich in nutrients and supports the growth of rare plants. Elk Knob and Rittle Knob, which are now part of Elk Knob State Park, are ecologically rich sites that host diverse and rare plant species such as Gray's lily, rattlesnake root, flame azalea, purple fringed orchid and trailing wolfsbane. Northern hardwood forests grow at Elk Knob State Park. This type of forest consists of sugar maple, American beech, yellow buckeye and yellow birch trees. The trees that grow near the summits of Rittle and Elk Knobs have been stunted by the low temperatures, high elevation and high winds. Trees that are just a few feet high can be well over one hundred years old. The forests of Elk Knob State Park provide a habitat for a number of woodland species including a breeding colony of ravens, the American black bear, bobcat, white-tailed deer, and wild turkeys. Since the park is largely undeveloped, these species have lived in an environment that has been largely left undisturbed by humans. Any development at the park has left minimal ecologic damage. Recreation Elk Knob State Park is one of the newest state parks in North Carolina. Recreational opportunities are limited since the facilities at the park have not yet been fully built, and they will remain somewhat limited since one of the original goals of the park is to maintain it as a natural area. An old road that leads to the summit of Elk Knob served as the park's initial hiking trail, but it is steep and rocky, making it a difficult hike. A less steep and easier to ascend hiking trail was constructed with the help of volunteers, and it was finished September 4, 2011. The old road is planned to be formally closed to hiking, so the process of secondary succession will be encouraged on the road bed. Upon reaching the summit hikers can view Mount Jefferson, Grandfather Mountain, Mount Mitchell, and various peaks in Tennessee and Virginia. In the fall of 2012, the park opened up a back-country camping area for backpackers. The facilitates consist of 3 individual sites, two group sites, and a \\"zone camping area\\", where up to three sites may be established by backpackers. No campfires are permitted, and campers must use bear canisters. The park has allowed limited front-country camping during the weekend of the National Wildlife Federation's Great American Backyard Campout. A small picnic area was provides several picnic tables and grills, along a forested, road loop. Also, a small office area was constructed near the park's entrance.

KGOW's programming schedule is leased to a third party group that utilizes the broadcast day to air Vietnamese focused programming for southwest Houston, Bellaire, and the areas in southwest Harris County where 1560's signal is strongest. Viet Radio programming is simulcasted on 1480 KNGO Dallas. The daytime transmitter site is located in Lochridge, Texas, across from Brazos Bend State Park. The nighttime transmitter site is in western Harris County, halfway between Katy, Texas and Hockley, Texas. KGOW used its nighttime authorization at 15 kilowatts full-time, as the 46 kilowatt daytime site was damaged by floodwaters during a flooding event in 2016, then again in Hurricane Harvey. KGOW did not operate on the day power for over one year, authorized by the Federal Communications Commission through a Special Temporary Authority that allows KGOW to operate at reduced power until which time the daytime site could be repaired. This occurred in March 2018. The studios are located in Uptown Houston one block from The Galleria. The facility originated in Port Lavaca, Texas and began operations in 1961 as KGUL, which remained as such until 1996, when the RAFTT Corporation purchased it and moved the facility into the Houston metropolitan area, licensed to Bellaire. History 1560 first appeared in south Texas as KGUL, based in Port Lavaca, Texas. It was, at one time, a sister station to 95.9 (now KHMC) and 93.3 (now KNAL). 1270 KIOX, licensed to Bay City, Texas, through the ill- advised actions of its owner at the time, moved KIOX from Bay City to Stafford Texas without proper FCC permission, wishing to capitalize on the money that could be commanded from having the signal closer to the Houston market, and directly within the exploding suburbs of Stafford, Missouri City, and Sugar Land. The station then applied and was granted a call set change to KFCC. After the Federal Communications Commission investigated the illegal move, KFCC's license was deleted, and the facility went dark. After it was clear that KFCC was permanently deleted, the principals secured a front \\"real party in interest\\" to take the KGUL Port Lavaca facility to Houston instead. Now KILE, it originally operated with 800 watts from just south of the 610 South Loop, then later 5,000 watts on a simple directional system, retaining the 800 watts for nighttime operation. KILE featured programming with a Multi-Language talk radio format, and was the only one in the Houston area to broadcast in many languages. This format remained in place until August 1, 2007, when Gow Media was ready to begin transmission testing from the new 46 kilowatt daytime and 15 kilowatt nighttime facilities. As a stunt, Gow Media began airing classic hits on KILE for the testing purposes. After testing concluded, a sports/guy talk format debuted on KILE (now as KGOW) on August 20, 2007 under the name of \\"1560 The Game\\", and becoming the flagship station of Gow Media and Sporting News Radio. After a few months on the air, KGOW dropped the guy talk portion of the format and focused solely on sports talk and game time play by play for various sporting events around Houston. The sports format ended on September 30, 2017. The former \\"SB Nation 1560\\" was moved to FM, on relay translator K231CN Houston as \\"Sports Map 94.1\\". K231CN is allegedly fed by KGOW sister station KFNC's HD2 subchannel, though no evidence has ever been found that KFNC is actually broadcasting an HD2 channel. Facility Operations During daytime hours, KGOW transmits from near Rosharon, TX, SSW of Houston, with 46,000 watts. At night, KGOW transmits from near Cypress- Katy, TX, NW of Houston, with 15,000 watts. The highly directive nature of both the daytime antenna array (six towers, with high efficiency) and the nighttime antenna array (nine towers, with standard efficiency) means that the apparent power towards Houston is greatly in excess of the licensed power, about the equivalent of 857,000 watts days and 197,000 watts nights (when compared to the 1,000 watt non-directional reference antenna for this class of station, Class B). This effect is shared by a number of other Class B stations in the Houston market. Houston has no allocated Class A stations (the only Class A stations in Texas are allocated to Dallas, KRLD, 1080 kHz; Fort Worth, WBAP, 820 kHz; and San Antonio, WOAI, 1200 kHz).

Its main settlements are the village of Upper Seagry (first documented in 1317 as 'Over Seagry') and the hamlet of Lower Seagry (first documented in 1218 as 'Nether Seagry'). The toponym is thought to derive from the Old English for \\"sedge stream\\". Sedge is the common name for plants of the family Cyperaceae and stream here may refer to the River Avon, which flows through the area. History There is evidence that the area was settled in the Upper Paleolithic period, and also of Saxon occupation. The Domesday Book of 1086 records 21 households and two manors: Segrete held by Durand of Gloucester, and Segrie by Drogo Fitz Ponz. Segrete became part of the estates of the Earl of Hereford, and later passed into the ownership of Bradenstoke Abbey until the Dissolution of the Monasteries. A grange farm at Lower Seagry was associated with the Abbey. Seagry is mentioned several times by Francis Kilvert in his Diary. He was living at nearby Langley Burrell at the time, and visited the Awdry family at Seagry vicarage. Seagry House at Upper Seagry was a five-bay mansion built in the 18th century by Nathaniel Stratton and extended to designs of Harold Brakspear in 1915. The house was rebuilt after a 1949 fire but the 18th-century gatepiers at the east and south entrances survive. The Seagry House estate was bought in 1785 by Sir James Tylney-Long of Draycot Cerne. Through inheritance and marriage it passed down to William, 5th Earl of Mornington (1813–1863) and then Henry Wellesley, 1st Earl Cowley (1804–1884). Christian Wellesley, 4th Earl Cowley sold most of the land in 1920, but the house remained in the Cowley family until 1949. Upper Seagry The village is on a minor road between Malmesbury and Sutton Benger at . It has a modern village hall, run jointly with Great Somerford and Startley, and Seagry CofE (VC) Primary School. The school was founded in 1966 and has about 40 pupils. In 2008 the school federated (a process whereby two or more schools choose to share resources, in this case a shared headteacher and governing body) with Somerfords' Walter Powell CofE (VA) school in Great Somerford. Lower Seagry The hamlet is east of Upper Seagry at , towards Great Somerford. Local government The civil parish elects a parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions. The present parish was formed in 1971. The ancient parish was added to Sutton Benger parish in 1934, then in 1971 the newly built M4 motorway became the boundary between the parishes of Sutton Benger and Seagry. Religious sites The Church of England parish church of St Mary the Virgin at Lower Seagry was founded in 1172 by Walter de Clifford, a descendant of the Fitz Ponz family. One of the 13th-century effigies in the church is said to be his. The church was rebuilt in 1849 on the same plan as the 12th or 13th century building by one of the architects in the Hakewill family, in squared rubble stone with a west bellcote. The 12th-century stone font bowl and 15th-century timber altar screen were retained. Today the parish is part of the Draycot benefice, a group of five churches. A Primitive Methodist chapel was built at Upper Seagry in 1825. It fell into disuse around 2010 and was sold for residential use. See also * The hamlet of Seagry Heath is in Great Somerford parish.

She was one of a small minority of women who attended college at all. In addition Norman did graduate work and taught at Douglas High School in Huntington, West Virginia, for more than 40 years. When teaching was considered one of the most critical and prestigious careers for a developing nation. A devoted educator, Norman was a charter member of the Beta Tau Omega chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha in Huntington and helped build social capital in her community. Early life Born as the eighth of sixteen children to Thomas Norman and Virginia Thomas, Lavinia Norman grew up in Montgomery, West Virginia. Her elementary years were spent in West Virginia. When her father got a job with the Postal Service, Norman's family moved to Washington, D.C. In 1901, she started secondary work at Howard University's Preparatory School. She graduated in 1905 with a diploma. Howard University and founding of Alpha Kappa Alpha Lavinia Norman entered Howard University, the top historically black college in the nation, at a time when only 1/3 of 1% of African Americans and 5% of whites attended any college.James D. Anderson, The Education of Blacks in the South, 1860–1935.

It was introduced in 1990, and was the first system to handle arbitrarily large SGML documents, and to render them according to multiple style-sheets that could be switched at will. DynaText and its Web sibling DynaWeb won multiple Seybold and other awards , and there are eleven US Patents related to the DynaText technology: 5,557,722; 5,644,776; 5,708,806; 5,893,109; 5,983,248; 6,055,544; 6,101,511; 6,101,512; 6,105,044; 6,167,409; and 6,546,406. History DynaText was developed by Electronic Book Technologies (EBT), Incorporated, of Providence, Rhode Island. EBT was founded by Louis Reynolds, Steven DeRose, Jeffrey Vogel, and Andries van Dam, and was sold to Inso corporation in 1996, when it had about 150 employees. DynaText stands in the long tradition of hypermedia at Brown University, and adopted many features pioneered by FRESS, such as unlimited document sizes, dynamically-controllable styles and views, and reader-created links and trails. DynaText heavily influenced stylesheet technologies such as DSSSL and CSS. XML chairman Jon Bosak cites EBT chief architect Steven DeRose as one of the originators of the notion of well-formedness formalized in XML, as well as DynaText for influencing the design of Web browsers in general; Jon Bosak produced SGML versions of the complete works of Shakespeare, the KJV Old Testament and New Testament, Book of Mormon, and Quran, and released them in 1994 bundled with Dynatext. Inso corporation went out of business in 2002. DynaText was demonstrated live by DeRose and David Sklar at \\"A Half-Century of Hypertext at Brown: A Symposium\\", held at Brown University on May 23, 2019 , using a variorum edition The Wife of Bath's Tale, published in DynaText by Cambridge University Press. Technology DynaText accepted SGML as input, and built a binary representation of the structure (similar to DOM for XML, but persistent), as well as a full-text inverted index of the text, elements, and attributes. Customers typically distributed such compiled e-books on CD- ROM or via network servers. Later versions of DynaText could also read SGML on the fly, providing exactly the same interface. Unlike many prior systems, DynaText was not limited to any particular DTD (or schema). Rather, customers could build style sheets in a simple language (also SGML-based), using properties very much like the later DSSSL, CSS, and XSL-FO. However, every property could have an expression as its value, which would be evaluated (if necessary) for each element the style applied to. Graphics, tables, formulae, and plug-ins could be included in documents. Unlike nearly all prior SGML systems, DynaText was not limited to documents that could fit in RAM on the viewing or serving computer system. Users commonly created documents in the tens to hundreds of MB. DynaText customers included aerospace, workstation and other computer industry firms, government, literary and technical publishers, and others. Full-text searches were based on an inverted index of words and other tokens (except for Japanese text, which was handled specially). Dynatext could report the number of \\"hits\\" for a given search, that occur within each section in the table of contents (by default, the table of contents appeared in a separate pane as an expandable outline, and clicking on any entry scrolled the full-text pane to the start of the corresponding section). Searches could also restrict hits to particular SGML element types, or sequences of types; refer to attributes; and use Boolean operators and parentheses. The \\"and\\" operator restricted its operands to occurring near each other, by default in the same paragraph or comparable element.

One of the torpedo tubes could be removed to accommodate a further two six-pounders, although by 1908 both five 6-pounder guns and both torpedo tubes were generally fitted. Surly was laid down at Thomson's Clydeside shipyard as yard number 271 on 14 February 1894 and was launched on 10 November 1894. She reached a speed of during Sea trials and was commissioned in July 1895. Service Surly spent her whole career in British waters, and was based at Portsmouth.

It publishes a scientific magazine, Tijdschrift voor economische en sociale geografie (Journal of Economic & Social Geography)Tijdschrift voor economische en sociale geografie (Journal of Economic & Social Geography), Edited by: Bouke van Gorp (Executive Editor) and Frank van Oort (Editor-in-Chief), Wiley Publishing website and Nederlandse Geografische Studies or NGS (Dutch Geographical Studies). It also has a large collection of about 135,000 maps and 4500 atlases which have been housed at a library at the University of Amsterdam since 1880. Activities KNAG currently consists of about 3,300 members. The organization publishes two magazines: *Journal of Economic and Social Geography (English, international scientific journal) *Geography (Professional magazine for Dutch Geographers) The organization also has an extensive collection of maps (almost 135,000) and atlases (4,500). This collection is preserved since 1880 in the Library of the University of Amsterdam and contains material from the 16th century. History The society was founded in 1873 in imitation of similar groups other the major European countries, such as France (1821: Société de Géographie de Paris), England (1830: Royal Geographical Society), Germany (Berlin, 1828, 1836 Frankfurt, Munich, 1869, Bremen 1870 Hamburg, 1873, Leipzig 1861), and Russia (St. Petersburg] 1845). Pieter Johannes Veth was the first chairman of the KNAG. A sister association in Belgium (Antwerp and Brussels) was founded in 1876. At that time the political and economic power of The Netherlands was only a fraction of its historic strength. Dissatisfaction of both merchants and scientists was a key driver to the growth of the society. The attractiveness of finding rich resources in the then largely unexplored outer regions of the colonies was an underlying cause for the development of Dutch Geographical Society, driven by the then- prevailing spirit of imperialism and colonialism. This was generally found to justify expeditions, sometimes with far-reaching consequences for the target population and area. The society organized several expeditions to Surinam, Borneo (see the expeditions by dr. Anton Willem Nieuwenhuis), islands in the Dutch Indies archipelago, South Africa and even to visit the indigenous tribes in North America. Most expeditions consisted of scientists from different disciplines, a photographer and a naval officer. Sometimes a larger military contingent was necessary if the expedition was travelling to a more dangerous area. Colonial territories were largely often no more than a number of administrative posts on the coast, from where trade was operated by tribes from the interior. The interior had hardly been mapped and were often referred to as \\"white spots\\". The members of the organization were not just scientists. The political and commercial elite (bankers, factory owners, ship owners and captains of merchant ships) were members. It had an economic agenda as well as a scientific mission. Expeditions were also conducted on the areas of Dutch farmers in the interior of South Africa and the indigenous peoples (then called Indians) of North America. These expeditions were often set up in collaboration with the colonial and colonial business organizations such as the Society for the Promotion of Scientific Research of the Dutch Colonies (MNK) and the Association for Suriname and there were often years of preparation. Usually such an expedition consisted of scientists from different disciplines, a photographer and a naval officer. If an expedition data had an area could be set both routes for the movement, for example, coal or bauxite, but also regions could be placed under effective political governance, which were previously controlled only nominally. The military escort increased as more hostilities were found in front of members of the expedition by local indigenous residents. KNAG Pole Expedition, 1882-1883 Not only the colonies were visited. Then in the second half of the nineteenth century, several European countries found some expeditions to the Arctic sins that the Netherlands could not stay behind. Within the Geographical Society a huge lobby was set to launch a Dutch expedition. During meetings held men Koolemans Beijnen and Marin Jansen speeches, while in the Journal of the Society appeared spirited speeches. [1] Although some disagreements between the organizing committee and the AG were launched last still a national collection, which raised enough money to build a schooner and equip. In 1878 Willem Barents went first northwards, to explore under the leadership of Lieutenant Anthony Hubers Svalbard, Jan Mayen and the west coast of Novaya Zemlya. In 1882, the AG would support another expedition, and that the scientific enterprise within the framework of the International Polar Year, the Dutch polar expedition 1882-83. 1900 - 1960 The intertwining of economic interests concern some scientists in the Netherlands, as it did in other countries, so scientists set up their own organizations. In the Netherlands were the Association for Economic Geography (1909; first magazine for economic geography of the world) and the Geographical Circle (1917; later Geographic Society). As Dutch colonies became independent, the work of the KNAG focused less and less on economic issues, and became increasingly concerned with scientific questions. The Dutch East Indies became independent in 1949 and Netherlands New Guinea became independent in 1962. The last expedition of the KNAG was the Star Mountains Expedition in 1959 to Dutch New Guinea, where the last unknown area map was brought and the Juliana Summit (now Puncak Mandala) was climbed. 1960s - present In the 60s turned the tide for all organizations. They became ashamed of their colonial past. The main colonies were independent (Dutch East Indies in 1949, Dutch New Guinea became part of Indonesia in 1962) and the expeditions were stopped. 1967 brought the Association for Economic Geography and Geographic Society in a refreshed KNAG. The economic backdrop was gone and the organization has since focused science in all areas of geography and geography teaching in secondary schools. At the 130th anniversary in 2003 an exhibition at the Tropical Museum and a corresponding publication looked back at the history of the expedition organization. In 2005 gives the society, together with the Dutch Institute for Military History, published the Great Atlas of the Netherlands (1930-1950).

In hydrodynamics, a clapotis (from French for \\"lapping of water\\") is a non-breaking standing wave pattern, caused for example, by the reflection of a traveling surface wave train from a near vertical shoreline like a breakwater, seawall or steep cliff. The resulting clapotic wave does not travel horizontally, but has a fixed pattern of nodes and antinodes. These waves promote erosion at the toe of the wall, and can cause severe damage to shore structures. The term was coined in 1877 by French mathematician and physicist Joseph Valentin Boussinesq who called these waves 'le clapotis' meaning \\"the lapping\\". In the idealized case of \\"full clapotis\\" where a purely monotonic incoming wave is completely reflected normal to a solid vertical wall, the standing wave height is twice the height of the incoming waves at a distance of one half wavelength from the wall. In this case, the circular orbits of the water particles in the deep-water wave are converted to purely linear motion, with vertical velocities at the antinodes, and horizontal velocities at the nodes. The standing waves alternately rise and fall in a mirror image pattern, as kinetic energy is converted to potential energy, and vice versa. In his 1907 text, Naval Architecture, Cecil Peabody described this phenomenon: Related phenomena True clapotis is very rare, because the depth of the water or the precipitousness of the shore are unlikely to completely satisfy the idealized requirements. In the more realistic case of partial clapotis, where some of the incoming wave energy is dissipated at the shore, the incident wave is less than 100% reflected, and only a partial standing wave is formed where the water particle motions are elliptical. This may also occur at sea between two different wave trains of near equal wavelength moving in opposite directions, but with unequal amplitudes. In partial clapotis the wave envelope contains some vertical motion at the nodes. When a wave train strikes a wall at an oblique angle, the reflected wave train departs at the supplementary angle causing a cross-hatched wave interference pattern known as the clapotis gaufré (\\"waffled clapotis\\"). In this situation, the individual crests formed at the intersection of the incident and reflected wave train crests move parallel to the structure. This wave motion, when combined with the resultant vortices, can erode material from the seabed and transport it along the wall, undermining the structure until it fails. Clapotic waves on the sea surface also radiate infrasonic microbaroms into the atmosphere, and seismic signals called microseisms coupled through the ocean floor to the solid Earth. Clapotis has been called the bane and the pleasure of sea kayaking.

Liveries As Capital Citybus originated from Ensign, the fleet experienced several livery iterations from their inherited blue and silver scheme, starting out as merely Ensign blue/silver vehicles with Ensign Citybus fleetnames painted over where the Ensignbus name was, into variations of yellow and silver. The company settled on an allover yellow livery with stylised C logos either side of the destination blind on the front of the bus. Initially buses had red fleetnames incorporating the Chinese characters \\"城巴\\" (Citybus) and the stylised C with the Capital Citybus name, along with taglines such as \\"moving comfortably ahead\\" and \\"here today... here tomorrow\\". After the sale of the company to its management, the fleetname was subsequently modified to just Capital Citybus. with the Chinese characters and stylised C phased out. Capital Citybus was a frequent contractor for British Rail and London Underground replacement service work, and during its existence operated specially liveried vehicles for Docklands Light Railway and the East London Line replacement services. As the regulations changed regarding London tendered service liveries, a revised mainly red livery was introduced. As the company passed into First ownership, for a time there existed a subtly different First Capital red and yellow livery with the First Group flying f replacing the Citybus C on the front of buses, and First Capital replacing the Capital Citybus.

Sex workers are required to have regular health checks. However, the laws are rarely applied and prostitution is widespread, partly due to poverty and internal displacement. Domestically, organized crime networks, some related to illegal armed groups, are responsible for human trafficking for sexual slavery and the armed conflict has made a large number of internal trafficking victims vulnerable. UNAIDS estimate there to be 7,218 prostitutes in the country. Illegal prostitution Child prostitution A series of factors put children at risk for sexual exploitation in Colombia and leave them unprotected. The war and the drug trade have altered family structures that in ordinary times would have provided safety and nurture. The war has also caused the displacement of countless families, some of whose children have been soldiers in the war. Displaced children are particularly vulnerable to being forced into prostitution, even more so in the declining economy. A spokesman for the UN's children's fund, UNICEF, Karel de Rooy, said many child prostitutes were as young as nine years old and that clients were often middle-aged foreigners. He also said that the children were often addicted to drugs. Commercial sexual exploitation of children is found especially in urban centers and in areas where there are large numbers of men who are separated from families due to work. Children are involved in commercial sexual exploitation either on the streets or in private establishments such as bars, brothels, or massage parlors. The culture of violence in Colombia had created a feeling of fear and resignation among the population; the violence had led to child prostitution and child gangs which added to the worsening situation of violence. Colombia also is a destination for foreign child sex tourists, particularly coastal cities such as Cartagena and Barranquilla. Sex trafficking Colombia is a major source country for women and girls trafficked to Latin America, the Caribbean, Western Europe, Asia, and North America, including the United States, for purposes of commercial sexual exploitation. Internally, women and children are trafficked from rural to urban areas for commercial sexual exploitation. Continued armed violence in Colombia has displaced many communities, making them vulnerable to human trafficking. Groups at high risk for internal trafficking include displaced persons, poor women in rural areas, and relatives of members of criminal organizations. Members of gangs and organized criminal networks force their relatives and acquaintances, and displaced persons–typically women and children–into conditions of forced prostitution. Many traffickers disclose the sexual nature of the work they offer but conceal information about working conditions, clientele, freedom of movement, and compensation. Others disguise their intent by portraying themselves as modeling agents, offering marriage brokerage services, providing study programs, or operating lottery or bingo scams with free trips as prizes. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Colombia as a 'Tier 1' country. Government response The Government of Colombia is making efforts to fight child prostitution, forced prostitution, sexual slavery and human trafficking. Colombia prohibits all forms of trafficking through its anti-trafficking statute, Law 985, which prescribes minimum punishments of 13 to 23 years’ imprisonment. The Government of Colombia cooperates with foreign governments to repatriate trafficking victims and investigate trafficking cases. The Government has improved prevention efforts against human trafficking by launching a widespread education campaign entitled “The Next Victim Could Be You” in October 2008. The campaign included TV commercials, radio spots, and print advertising featuring a popular Colombian television personality. However, the poverty and violence from the country create an environment where sexual exploitation thrives. Many victims of trafficking refuse to assist in the prosecution of their traffickers due to fear of reprisals.

During sea trials in October 1895, Starfish made an average speed of over six runs over a measured mile, meeting the requirement of the specification. Starfish was commissioned in January 1896. Service Starfish served throughout her career in home waters, being prone to failures of her propeller brackets, which were made of forged scrap iron. In late January 1900 it was announced that she would be commissioned as tender to the gunnery school . In 1900–1901, Starfish was used in tests of a modified spar torpedo for use as an anti-submarine weapon. The long spar, carrying an explosive charge, would be swung out and immersed in the water in action, and detonated as the submarine was passed.Brassey 1902, pp. 146–147. Starfish was attached to the torpedo school at Portsmouth in 1901, participating in the 1901 Naval Manoeuvres.Brassey 1902, pp. 86, 91.

In 1900 she was commissioned to serve at the Mediterranean station, and was ordered to return home in early 1902. She left Gibraltar on 9 May, convoyed by the cruiser , and arrived in Plymouth on 14 May. She paid off at Devonport on 20 May, and was placed in the A Division of the Fleet Reserve. Lieutenant James Farie was appointed in command on 1 August 1902, as she took part in the fleet review held at Spithead on 16 August 1902 for the coronation of King Edward VII. Lieutenant R. M. Haynes succeeded him in command later the same month, on 28 August, when she was attached to the Devonport instructional flotilla. In 1906 Skate was used as a target in firing trials of the effectiveness of various guns against destroyers. 3-pounder (47 mm) guns proved ineffective, having difficulty penetrating the ship's plating in end-on engagements, and while 12-pounder (3-in (76 mm)) guns caused more damage, it was concluded that a single hit could not be guaranteed to disable a destroyer. 4-inch (102 mm) guns proved much more effective, particularly when Lyddite-filled shells were used, and this led to a change in destroyer armament to 4-inch guns.Brown 2003, pp. 178, 187.Friedman 2009, p. 108.

Biography Straus was born in Chicago in 1897. He pursued a career as a newspaperman, serving as managing editor of the Chicago Evening Post and rising to the position of Washington, D.C. bureau chief of the International News Service. In 1933, Harold L. Ickes, the newly appointed Secretary of the United States Department of the Interior, selected Straus as a personal aide and handler of the Cabinet secretary's press relations. Straus served at Ickes's side during his chief's tenure at the Interior Department, rising to the position of First Assistant Secretary of the Department in March 1943. In 1946, soon after the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Ickes resigned from the Cabinet. Straus continued as part of the new Truman Administration, moving laterally in December 1945 to the position of Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation within the Interior Department. Straus's tenure at Reclamation during the late 1940s coincided with one of the Bureau's most intensive period of concrete dam-building, with numerous structures built in the Columbia River, the Colorado River drainage, and other major watersheds across the American West. Straus presided over the construction and dedication of dams such as Hungry Horse Dam in Montana. He left his position in 1953 soon after the inauguration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Criticism The Bureau of Reclamation has been severely criticized for the permanent alterations it made to natural waterflows throughout the western United States. Works like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, by novelist Ken Kesey, lament what they see as the destruction caused by the dams and reservoirs constructed by the Bureau of Reclamation and its sister agency, the Army Corps of Engineers, during this period. On the other hand, the electrical power generated by the new federal dams constructed during this period has become an essential element in the lives of millions of people in Idaho, Oregon, Washington, and neighboring states. Later life Michael W. Straus lived in retirement with his wife Nancy Porter Straus in Washington, D.C., until dying on August 9, 1970. Through Nancy he was a brother-in-law of photographer Eliot Porter and painter Fairfield Porter.

MacManus's friend, Charles Gavan Duffy, stated that he was orphaned when his father, who was a catholic soldier, was killed whilst serving with his regiment. Duffy went on to say that MacManus was then reared in the soldier's hospital in the Phoenix Park as a Protestant, the Royal Hibernian Military School. MacManus was living with Duffy in 1835, attempting to make a living as an artist. He died on 22 March 1878 at his home at 2 Leinster Terrace, Dalkey. He is buried at Enniskerry, County Wicklow. Career MacManus's first contribution to the Royal Hibernian Academy (RHA) was in 1835, becoming a member of the Belfast Association of Artists in 1836, exhibiting four portraits with them. He also exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1839 to 1841 as well as the British Institute and the Old Water-colour Society. His paintings featured historical scenes and depictions of everyday Irish life, including works such as May-day at Finglas, Co. Dublin, (1839), and An Irish Market-day, Ballybay, Co. Monaghan (1841). MacManus was employed in London from 1837–1844 and was a head teacher at Somerset House before being appointed headmaster at the new Glasgow School of Design (now the Glasgow School of Art) in 1844. After receiving initial praise followed by a salary increase at the suggestion of the governors, difficulty erupted between MacManus and the school's committee of management. He resigned from the Glasgow School of Design in 1848 and moved to Dublin where he would hold the position as headmaster at the Dublin School of Art until 1862. MacManus at GASHE. Retrieved 27 November 2007. MacManus's tenure in Dublin was largely successful, with his establishment of classes for women one of his most noted achievements. Amongst his noted pupils was Mary Alment. He also organised the Royal Dublin Society (RDS) exhibition of arts and industries, and served as superintendent at the new women's industrial school at Carrickmacross, County Monaghan. After 1854, following a reduction in staff by the Department of Science and Art, MacManus complained that the school's reputation was being undermined and that he was overworked. However, the department felt that academic standards were suffering due to a decline in MacManus's health, and pressurised the RDS into removing him. MacManus circulated a letter with the press dated 26 June 1862 when the RDS threatened to dismiss him unless he resigned. The letter rallied much support from his former students. He was dismissed by the RDS for improper conduct on 11 July 1862, but reinstated him after an apology. He finally was forced to retire on 30 September 1863, with the title of honorary professor of fine arts. MacManus was featured regularly with the RHA, becoming an associate in 1835 and a full member in 1858. He was also the RHA professor of drawing from 1873 to 1878. In 1853, he exhibited two plaster sculptures, but he was primarily a landscape artist. Art historian Walter George Strickland stated that MacManus's work was \\"poor in colour, puerile and even ludicrous\\", but credits his earlier work with more merit. MacManus also illustrated books, including Hall's Ireland and Carleton's Traits and Stories of the Irish Peasants. Alongside the sculptor John Hogan, MacManus presented Daniel O'Connell a National Cap at the monster meeting of Mullagh-mast, causing celebre as English journalists insisted on identifying the cap as the crown of Ireland.

It is only permitted by registered prostitutes in licensed brothels. Prostitutes must register and must undergo regular health checks for sexually transmitted diseases (every 20 days). The police are allowed to check whether the prostitutes are registered or not, and have attended a clinic during the previous 20 days. In 2016 UNAIDS estimated there were 30,523 prostitutes in Bolivia. Societal views Although prostitution is widespread in Bolivia, the prostitutes are severely stigmatized by society, they are blamed for everything from broken homes to the rising HIV-infection rate. In 2007, in El Alto, hundreds of prostitutes were attacked, forced to strip and beaten by angry locals; several brothels were burnt. Citizens demanded that brothels and bars be located at least 3,200 feet away from schools. The municipal government responded by closing all brothels within 1,600 feet of schools, but took no action against those who had attacked the prostitutes. \\"We are Bolivia's unloved,\\" said Yuly Perez, vice-president of ONAEM, the Bolivian sex workers' union, \\"If we don't work, who's going to feed our kids?\\" Another representative from the sex worker organization said that: \\"People think the point of our organization is to expand prostitution in Bolivia. In fact, we want the opposite. Our ideal world is one free of the economic desperation that forces women into this business.\\"Friedman, Jean. (24 October 2007) Prostitutes Strike in Bolivia. TIME. Retrieved on 2011-03-30. Child prostitution In Bolivia, the average age of entry into prostitution is 16.Refworld  Rights of the Child in Bolivia . UNHCR (31 January 2005). Retrieved on 2011-03-30. Child prostitution is a serious problem, particularly in urban areas and in the Chapare region.2008 Human Rights Report: Bolivia. State.gov (25 February 2009). Retrieved on 2011-03-30. Most children forced into prostitution come from the lower social classes and from broken families. Only 12.6% of these children have any education, leaving them with few opportunities. As a result, many remain in the sex trade throughout adulthood, despite wanting to exit. Approximately one third of girls and adolescents in prostitution have between one and five children, mostly under the age of 5. Most child prostitutes work on the streets, inside brothels or inside bars and clubs. There are different types of child prostitution, varying with the economic power of the client and the age of the child. Upper-class clients tend to seek older adolescents aged 16–17 (and young adult prostitutes aged 18–20). Many of these youth come from Eastern Bolivia and from outside of the country. This type of prostitution is organised by closed networks, and is subject to very few controls. In some cases, the sexual contact between these adolescents and their clients takes place at the client's house. Adolescents from all parts of the country prostitute themselves in local bars or pubs, mainly for middle-class clients. Street prostitution involves women and girls of all ages who typically enter the trade when they are between the ages of 12 and 15 years. Finally, there is a form of “hidden” prostitution, which can involve children as young as 8 years, often in exchange for drugs or some kind of treat or toy. During the day, these children stay in the street often working as street vendors, domestic servants or waitresses. At night they go to dance clubs or sell alcohol in the street. Clients of this type of prostitution are generally adults or adolescents with little money. The problem of child prostitution is exacerbated by poorly enforced laws and by rare and ineffective police raids. However, recently, more efforts have been done to address this problem; in 2008, the police raided several brothels and rescued 215 children who were working there.Trafficking in Persons Report 2009 Country Narratives – Countries A Through C. State.gov. Retrieved on 30 March 2011. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the NGOs Save the Children and Pro-Adolescente conducted public awareness campaigns on the trafficking of children. La Paz Department and the La Paz city government each operate a shelter for abused and exploited children. Sex trafficking Economic and social problems create a climate which is favorable to human trafficking. Young Bolivian women and girls are trafficked from rural to urban areas for commercial sexual exploitation; women and children from the indigenous ethnic groups in the Altiplano region are at greater risk of being trafficked into prostitution. Faced with extreme poverty, many citizens become economic migrants, and some are victimized by traffickers and forced into prostitution, both inside and outside Bolivia. The country is also a source for victims trafficked for sexual exploitation to Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Spain, and the United States. Weak controls along the borders exacerbate this problem. In 2018 the United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons downgraded Bolivia's rank from 'Tier 2 Watch List' to a 'Tier 3' country.

In 1989, she and eight other nuns traveled from her hometown to the provincial capital of Lhasa when it was convulsed by Tibetan independence protests and riots, and handed out leaflets and shouted anti- Chinese slogans. She was tried and imprisoned for the charge of counterrevolutionary propaganda and incitement and imprisoned at the Drapchi Prison that same year. During her incarceration, she produced and smuggled out tapes of her and other prisoners' political songs, engaged in hunger strikes, and made publicized allegations of mistreatment. One of the better-known Tibetan prisoners outside Tibet, she was the subject of a release campaign by several United States Congress parliamentarians and governmental groups. Because of their efforts, and Chinese wishes to improve Sino-American relations, her sentence was reduced and commuted in 2004. She lives in Switzerland since 2006. Biography Phuntsog Nyidron was born in Phenpo near Lhasa, Tibet Autonomous Region, People's Republic of China in 1969. She did not attend school, enrolling in the Michungri Nunnery at age 18, and becoming the semiofficial leader of the nunnery. During the holiday of Losar in 1989, the year where the 14th Dalai Lama won the Nobel Peace Prize, she traveled with eight other nuns to the capital, Lhasa, while it was under martial law because of the 1989 Tibetan unrest. Against the advice of the Lhasans her group spoke to, she and three other nuns split with the main group, went to the Barkhor area around Jokhang Temple, and distributed leaflets and shouted slogans such as \\"Chinese get out of Tibet\\" and \\"Long Live Dalai Lama\\". They were arrested by local Tibetan police and sentenced to nine years' imprisonment by the Lhasa Intermediate People's Court for \\"counterrevolutionary propaganda and incitement\\". Dui Hua Welcomes Phuntsog Nyidron's Arrival in the United States. In 1993 while still in prison, she secretly recorded and smuggled out songs with some other prisoners that praised the Dalai Lama and demanded an independent Tibet, for which she was again convicted of counterrevolutionary propaganda and incitement and her sentence extended for eight more years. For the remainder of her time in Drapchi Prison, she did other political actions such as hunger strikes, and made allegations of corporal punishment and other mistreatment in prison. The Prison Law of the People's Republic of China was amended in 1994 to address such abuses.Testimony of Ms. Phuntsog Nyidron SANASHIGA Her sentence was reduced one year in 2001, and commuted completely in 2004, following calls and visits from groups like the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom and several United States parliamentarians. The Chinese government, \\"taking account the strong views of the Bush administration\\", released her for better relations with the United States, and to signal an increased willingness to talk with the Dalai Lama. She was the last of the 14 \\"Singing Nuns\\", named as such by the media for their 1993 album that was released from prison. In 2006, she was granted permission to leave for the United States for medical treatment. She subsequently moved to Switzerland, successfully applying for political asylum.
