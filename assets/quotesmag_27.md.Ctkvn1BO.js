It is named for John Bristow Wornall, an early settler of Kansas City, whose estate still stands today as a museum. Route description Wornall Road begins at 42nd Street in the Old Westport neighborhood. This section dead-ends after one block, interrupted by the campus of St. Luke's Hospital. Wornall then picks back up on the other side, extending to 47th Street on the Plaza. After a one- block interruption in the Plaza (where the road is named Broadway Street), Wornall Road begins in earnest after it crosses Brush Creek and Ward Parkway at the south end of the Plaza. Upon leaving the Plaza, Wornall Road climbs up a hill and passes by Loose Park. Between Ward Parkway and Gregory Boulevard (formerly 71st Street), Wornall is a largely residential street, passing through the up-market neighborhoods of Country Club District and Brookside. It is along this stretch (at the corner with 61st Terrace) that the Wornall House is located. South of Gregory Boulevard, Wornall Road changes to more of a commercial, suburban arterial-type road (although remaining within Kansas City city limits). This stretch of commercial development (interspersed by apartments and middle-class suburban ranch houses) extends more-or-less uninterrupted to the junction with Interstate 435, just south of 103rd Street. It is along this section (centered on the corner with 75th Street) that the neighborhood of Waldo is located. South of Interstate 435, Wornall Road once again assumes a mostly residential nature, passing numerous apartment complexes and suburban housing developments. Between I-435 and Red Bridge Road (the equivalent of 111th Street), Wornall deviates somewhat to the east; south of Red Bridge Road, Wornall Road drops to two lanes. At around 119th Street, Wornall Road runs past the campus of Avila University. The street goes past houses, as well as a couple golf courses, along its southernmost stretch. Wornall Road has its southern terminus at the intersection with 135th Street in Martin City, not far from Highway 150 and the Kansas state line.

The specific name honours Sam Berge, one of the landowners, and his friends who have supported the research. Probrachylophosaurus was one of eighteen dinosaur taxa from 2015 to be described in open access or free-to-read journals. The holotype, MOR 2919, was found in a layer of the Judith River Formation dating from the Campanian and being between 79.8 and 79.5 million years old, plus or minus two hundred thousand years. It consists of a partial skeleton with skull, of an adult individual. It contains the right premaxilla, both maxillae, the left jugal, a part of the right lacrimal, the rear of a left nasal bone, the middle part of a right nasal bone, the skull roof from the frontal bones to the exoccipitals, both squamosals, both quadrate bones, the predentary of the lower jaws, both dentaries, a right surangular, eleven neck vertebrae, eleven back vertebrae, twenty-nine tail vertebrae, nineteen chevron bones, nineteen ribs, the entire pelvis, both lower legs, a right second metatarsal and a right fourth metatarsal. The bones have not been found in articulation. Specimen MOR 1097, a fragmentary skull of a subadult individual, was referred to the species. It had been found at a kilometre distance from the holotype. Description Nasal crests Probrachylophosaurus is a large hadrosaurid. Its holotype is the largest brachysaurolophin specimen known. Because of this size the fossil has been nicknamed \\"Super-Duck\\". Its length has been estimated at nine metres, its weight at over five tonnes.Amanda Williams, \\"The 'superduck' that reveals how dinosaurs got their crests: 80-million-year-old creature is 'missing link' in the evolutionary tree\\", MailOnline 11 November 2015 Braincase of subadult Brachylophosaurus specimen MOR 940 In 2015, several distinguishing traits were established. Two of these are autapomorphies, unique derived characters. The skull crest is made of massive bone and is entirely formed by the nasal bones which, in adult individuals, overhang the supratemporal fenestrae over a distance of less than two centimetres. This crest is at its midline extremely thickened, resulting at the position of the rear frontals bones it overgrowths, in a pointed strongly triangular transverse cross-section, the upper angle of which in rear view is less than 130¬∞. Additionally, these autapomorphies form a unique combination with traits that in themselves are not unique. The rear lacrimal bone is transversely wide as in Acristavus but not Brachylophosaurus. Of the front branch of the jugal, the lower corner is positioned behind the level of the upper corner, as with Acristavus but not Brachylophosaurus. The squamosals touch each other at the skull midline as with Acristavus but not Brachylophosaurus. The nasal bone skull crest is massive and almost horizontally oriented to the rear as in Brachylophosaurus but different from Acristavus. Phylogeny Life restoration Cervical and dorsal vertebrae Skull Probrachylophosaurus was, within the Hadrosaurinae, placed in the Brachylophosaurini by the describing authors. Adding the traits of Probrachylophosaurus to two earlier datasets of cladistic analyses, resulted in slightly conflicting positions. In one analysis it was recovered as the sister species of Brachylophosaurus; in the other as a sister species of a clade consisting of Brachylophosaurus and Maiasaura. In both evolutionary trees Acristavus was in a more basal position. The authors suggested that Acristavus might have been a direct ancestor of Probrachylophosaurus and the latter, in view of its intermediate smaller crest form, again an ancestor of Brachylophosaurus that lived about 1.5 million years later. The revised analysis of Albert Prieto-M√°rquez resulted in the following evolutionary tree: Paleobiology Tibial histology of MOR 2919 The describing article also published the result of histological research of the bone structure of the left shinbone of the type specimen. This bone showed fourteen LAGs, lines of arrested growth, that likely represented yearly seasons of low food intake. The age of the holotype would thus be about fourteen years. The distance between the lines indicated this individual had not yet reached its maximum size, but closely approached it, proof that it was not simply a subadult Brachylophosaurus specimen with a small crest. The lines also showed a general slowing of the growth after the fifth year. This could have been an indication sexual maturity was reached at that age. If so, the onset of maturity was about two years later than with Maiasaura.

The 500-watt station initially broadcast on 930 kHz and was soon joined by shortwave simulcast XEBR on 11,820 kHz. The first concessionaire was Carlos G. Balderrama. By the 1960s, XEBH had moved down the dial to 920. It was owned by Radiodifusores de Sonora, S. de R.L., the concessionaire for the station until it was sold to MVS in 1994. The station added an FM combo in 1994, XHBH-FM 98.5. In the 2000s, it moved to 590 kHz as part of a swap with XEHQ, then on 590. In 2001, MVS introduced its Exa FM pop format to Hermosillo. Along with a number of other Exa FM stations nationwide, XEBH-XHBH became XEXA-XHEXA; eventually, the XHEXA-FM callsign exclusively moved to Mexico City 104.9 and the XEBH-XHBH callsigns were restored.

It is a Super-Earth with a minimum mass of over 7 times that of Earth. Unlike HD 219134 b it has not been observed by the Spitzer telescope and thus its radius and density are unknown. Only a minimum radius can be given. Characteristics=Mass, Radius, and Temperature HD 219134 f is known as a Super-Earth, a planet that's more massive than Earth but less massive than Uranus or Neptune. However, because it is not known to transit its star, only the minimum mass can be determined. The planet is at least 7.30 , indicating that it could be anything from a dense rocky planet to a low-density ice giant. Gillon et al. gives the planet a minimum radius of about 1.31 , which would result in an almost impossible density. For a more likely mixed composition of rock, water, and hydrogen, HD 219134 f would have a radius closer to about 2.10 . Being close to its star, HD 219134 f is hot, with an equilibrium temperature of . Therefore, if a rocky planet, it is too hot for liquid water. It receives about 12 times the stellar flux as Earth. Orbit HD 219134 f has an orbital period lasting about 22.72 days, only about a quarter of Mercury's, which lasts about 88 days. The planet also has an orbital radius, or semi- major axis, of 0.146 AU. For comparison, Mercury orbits at 0.38 AU, and Earth at 1 AU. Because of this close proximity, HD 219134 f is likely tidally locked. The planet is near a 1:3 resonance with HD 219134 c and a 2:1 resonance with HD 219134 d. Host Star The planet HD 219134 f orbits the K3V orange dwarf HD 219134, also known as HR 8832. It is 79% the radius and 80% the mass of the Sun with 28% the luminosity. It has a temperature of 4699 K and is around 12.5 billion years old or less. For comparison, the Sun has a temperature of 5778 K and is 4.55 billion years old. The apparent magnitude of the star, or how bright it appears from Earth, is around 5. Therefore, it is only just visible to the unaided eye.

It has a minimum mass of 11 Earth Masses, suggesting that it could be a high-mass ocean planet or a Neptune-like ice giant. Unlike HD 219134 b and HD 219134 c it has not been observed by the Spitzer Space Telescope and thus its radius and density are unknown. It resides closer to the star than the inner edge of the system's (empirical) habitable zone, defined by the recent Venus limit. If it has an Earth-like composition, it would have a radius 1.9 times that of Earth. However, since it is probably an ocean planet or Mini-Neptune, it is likely larger. Characteristics=Mass, Radius, and Temperature HD 219134 g is a sub-Neptune-mass exoplanet with a minimum mass of 10.81 and an unknown radius, as it is not known to transit. However, due to the high metal content of the host star, the planet might not be an ice giant. For a rock-iron composition, HD 219134 g would be about 1.9 , which seems unlikely for a planet of this mass. A more plausible rock-water composition would put the planet at about 2.4 . In the absence of an atmosphere, and assuming an albedo of 0.3, it has an equilibrium temperature of , but with an atmosphere it is likely to have a surface temperature much higher, that is if it has a rocky surface. So, it is rather unlikely to be habitable. Orbit HD 219134 g takes about 94.2 days to orbits its star at a distance of 0.3753 AU. This is comparable to Mercury's orbit of 88 days at about 0.38 AU. However, due to the lower luminosity of the host star, HD 219134 g is closer to Venus' situation. The eccentricity of the planet's orbit is believed to be close to zero, indicating a very circular orbit. Host Star The planet HD 219134 g orbits the K3V orange dwarf HD 219134, also known as HR 8832. It is 79% the radius and 80% the mass of the Sun with 26% the luminosity. It has a temperature of 4699 K and is around 11 billion years old. For comparison, the Sun has a temperature of 5778 K and is 4.55 billion years old. The apparent magnitude of the star, or how bright it appears from Earth, is around 5. Therefore, it is just visible to the unaided eye to most observers. Habitability HD 219134 g could be a potentially habitable planet. Based on its relatively low mass (~11 ) and the high metal content of the parent star (+0.11 [Fe/H]), it has a low chance of being an ocean planet. While these types of worlds have no solid surfaces for life to develop, it is predicted that biology would arise in ways other than that of Earth. The planet also appears to have a fairly similar temperature to Earth, if somewhat hotter than Earth's equilibrium temperature. HD 219134 g has an equilibrium temperature of , in fact exactly the same as Venus' equilibrium temperature, that is if Venus like Earth had an albedo of 0.3. However, the planet was not reported in the most recent analysis of the system with the HARPS-N spectrograph, which suggests that the planet may not actually exist. Although, even if the planet did exist, but wasn't tidally locked, it would not fit the understood criteria for being located within the star's habitable zone. For example, the habitable zone for this star, as defined by Kopparapu et al. 2014, for a 5 Earth mass planet, would be between 0.499 AU and 0.947 AU.= S_{eff_{\\\\odot}} + aT_{\\\\ast} + bT_{\\\\ast}^2 + cT_{\\\\ast}^3 + dT_{\\\\ast}^4 when used to calculate the stellar flux reaching the outer atmosphere of a 5 mass Earth-like planet orbiting HD 219134 at the Inner Habitable Zone edge - the Runaway Greenhouse limit gives a \\\\scriptstyle S_{eff_{\\\\ast}} of 1.0615 or 106.15% the stellar flux reaching the top of Earth's atmosphere.

At age nine, his father died. He grew up with two younger brothers and describes himself as a bully towards them in their younger years. He first got involved with theater in middle school, when his Drama teacher told him he would need to take a role in a production to pass the class. Alvarado's first play-writing experience was a monologue inspired by Luis Valdez's Zoot Suit, particularly Edward James Olmos' character El Pachuco. His first full-length play was written after he first moved to New York City, while he worked a temp-job in Midtown. After a reading with Ra√∫l Castillo in a Lower East Side bar, Alvarado decided focus his career on writing.  Education and career = Theater  Alvarado is a graduate of the University of North Carolina School of the Arts, as well as a member of Rising Phoenix Rep, alum of INTAR's Hispanic-Playwright-in-Residence Laboratory 2006 ‚Äì 2008 and a member of Company of Angels writer's group. During his residency, Alvarado wrote two plays, both of which premiered off-Broadway: Post No Bills, which premiered at the Rattlestick Playwrights Theater in 2009 and Basilica which premiered at the Cherry Lane Theater in 2013. In between these two works, Alvarado's play Sangre premiered in 2011 at NYC Summerstages. In 2015, Alvarado premiered Parachute Men at the Latina/o Theatre Commons' Carnaval of New Latina/o Work, which was hosted by The Theatre School at DePaul University. He described Parachute Men as something \\"really personal\\" to him, written about himself and his brothers and \\"'a kind of asking for forgiveness' play that deals with manhood and the lack of motherly love.\\" Although the play was inspired by his own history, Alvarado felt his characters needed to, \\"live and breathe on their own,\\" not reflect the personalities of himself or his brothers. While Alvarado considers himself Mexican-American, he does not see his work as addressing Mexican American or Chicano issues. Instead, he sees his writing as addressing family issues and believes that his work, in a vacuum, speaks to the American experience broadly.  Film and television  Alvarado has also worked in film and television, appearing in shows such as Law and Order, The Sopranos and Nurse Jackie. Additionally, he has written for FX's series Tyrant, receiving credit for the teleplay of Season 2 episode Desert Storm. His 2009 film Cruzando, which he co-wrote, directed, produced and starred in, was screened at the HBO New York International Latino Film Festival, Newport Beach International Film Festival, and London Latino International Film Festival. Further, Cruzando was awarded at the Mexican International Film Festival, San Antonio Film Festival and Seattle True Independent Film Festival. Cruzando is the story of 26 year old Manny, a resident of Monterrey, Mexico and father to be, who embarks on a journey to see his father for the last time before he is to be executed in Texas.  Personal life  Alvarado is a father and currently lives in Los Angeles. Although writing has taken a backseat to parenting, he tries to write at least an hour a day.

It was first formed in reserve in the Moscow Military District in October 1941, but soon was disbanded. It was formed a second time in July 1942, and continued in service until postwar. The 60th Army was commanded by Gen. Ivan Danilovich Chernyakhovsky for much of the war, and it was while in this command that he proved himself worthy to be promoted to the rank of General of the Army and command of a Front at the age of 38 years. Elements of the army went on to, among other things, liberate the Auschwitz concentration camp. First Formation The 60th Army was first formed in October 1941, as a reserve formation of the Moscow Military District. It comprised the 334th, 336th, 348th, 358th, and 360th Rifle DivisionsCharles C. Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From June to December 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. IX, 1996, pp 80, 81, 87, 92, 93 and the 11th Cavalry Division.Sharp, \\"Red Sabers\\", Soviet Cavalry Corps, Divisions, and Brigades 1941 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. V, 1995, p 41 All these divisions had been formed in the Volga Military District in the preceding months. The army was under the command of Lt. Gen. M.A. Purkayev. In December the rifle divisions were reassigned as follows: 334th, 358th and 360th to the 4th Shock Army, 336th to 5th Army, and 348th to 30th Army,Walter S. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2006, p 79 while the 11th Cavalry joined the 7th Cavalry Corps in January. Purkayev's headquarters group had already been used to create the command cadre for the new 3rd Shock Army, and 60th Army was disbanded on Dec. 25.David M. Glantz and Jonathan House, When Titans Clashed, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 1995, p 70 Second Formation In April and May 1942, STAVKA began forming a total of ten new combined-arms reserve armies in preparation for the expected German summer offensive. STAVKA expected this to be directed at Moscow, while the German plans were, in fact, for a drive to the southeast. On July 2, after disastrous losses further west, 3rd Reserve Army was released to take up positions north of Voronezh. The army was under command of Lt. Gen. M.A. Antoniuk.Glantz, To the Gates of Stalingrad, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2009, p 139 As late as July 5, the Soviet command believed the new German offensive was a prelude to an advance on Moscow, but shortly thereafter they understood the true intent.Glantz & House, p 117 The 3rd Reserve Army was directed to deploy to Voronezh Front, in the immediate environs of that eponymous city, and was renamed 60th Army on July 10.Glantz & House, p 113 At that time its order of battle was as follows: * 107th Rifle Division * 121st Rifle Division * 161st Rifle Division * 195th Rifle Division * 232nd Rifle Division * 237th Rifle Division * 303rd Rifle DivisionKeith E. Bonn, ed., Slaughterhouse, The Aberjona Press, Bedford, PA, 2005, p 329. Note that this source also includes the 167th Rifle Division, but according to Charles S. Sharp in Red Swarm, p 67, this division did not reach the front in 60th Army. On July 25, Mjr. Gen. I.D. Chernyakhovsky was appointed to the command of the army, a command he would hold until mid-April 1944. During the summer and autumn the 60th Army was engaged in an active defense of Voronezh and its approaches. German 4th Panzer Army arrived at the outskirts of the city on July 7 and began fighting to clear it of its 40th Army defenders. Counterattacks by 60th Army tied down these German mobile forces, leading to street fighting similar to what was to be seen in Stalingrad a few months later. The panzers were relieved by the infantry of 6th Army, and fighting continued until July 24 when the final Soviet defenders were cleared from the west bank sector of the city. The army continued to probe the German front in the weeks following in an attempt to deflect enemy forces from the fighting in Stalingrad; this cost significant losses in men and equipment and several of the divisions had to be taken out of the line for rebuilding. In the wake of Operation Uranus and Operation Little Saturn, the remaining Soviet forces on the southern half of the front joined in the winter counteroffensive. On Jan. 24, 1943 forces of Voronezh and Bryansk Fronts, including 60th Army, began the Voronezh-Kastornoye offensive against German 2nd Army, which was by now in a deep salient. Flanking and frontal attacks soon drove the remnants of that army westward in disorder towards Kursk and Belgorod.Glantz, After Stalingrad, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2009, pp 19-20, 34 The former city became the new objective, and it fell to the 60th on Feb. 8. Gen. Kuznetsov of Front headquarters reported: Following this the army staged another offensive aimed at L'gov and Ryl'sk from Feb. 12 - 20, exploiting the gap that had opened between German 2nd and 2nd Panzer Armies. Chernyakhovsky's attempt to take L'gov off the march was frustrated on Feb. 20; he then set out to envelop the town and eventually succeeded.Glantz, After Stalingrad, pp 278-80 On Mar. 19, 60th and 38th Armies formed the short-lived Kursk Front. Five days later this was renamed Oryol Front, and the 60th was reassigned to Gen. K.K. Rokossovsky's Central Front. As the Germans regained their balance and the offensives ground to a halt, 60th Army found itself in the deepest, westernmost sector of the Kursk Salient, where it would remain through the following months.Glantz, After Stalingrad, pp 370-73 Battle of Kursk On July 5, 1943, the order of battle of the army was as follows: 24th Rifle Corps, with: * 112th Rifle Division * 42nd Rifle Brigade * 129th Rifle Brigade 30th Rifle Corps, with: * 121st Rifle Division * 141st Rifle Division * 322nd Rifle Division Separate Division: * 55th Rifle Division Other units: * 248th Rifle Brigade * 150th Tank Brigade * 58th Armored Train Battalion * 1156th Cannon Regiment * 1178th Antitank Regiment * 128th, 138th and 497th Mortar Regiments * 98th Guards Mortar Regiment * 286th Separate Guards Mortar Battalion * 221st Guards, 217th Antiaircraft Regiments * 59th Engineer-Sapper Brigade * 317th Separate Engineer Battalionhttp://www.cgsc.edu/CARL/nafziger/943RGCC.PDF , pp 40-41 The sector of the salient occupied by the 60th was considerably west of where German 9th Army attempted to penetrate Central Front's lines, and the army saw little combat during the German offensive. It also remained largely inactive when the Front went over to the counteroffensive towards Oryol. In August the army was reinforced by the 1st Guards Artillery Division. This unit would remain with 60th Army until after the transfer to 1st Ukrainian Front in October.Sharp, \\"Red Thunder\\", Soviet Artillery Corps, Divisions and Brigades 1941 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. VI, Nafziger, 1995, p 38 Finally on Aug. 26 Central Front renewed its offensive against Army Group Center. 65th Army, along with the weakened 2nd Tank Army, struck 2nd Army's center at Sevsk, which was liberated on that first day. 48th Army flanked this drive on the right, while 60th operated on the left. The Germans counterattacked northwest of Sevsk on Aug. 29, halting the main drive, but the 60th was able to break through on its sector, which the Germans had weakened in favor of Sevsk. By the end of the day Cherniakhovsky's forces had liberated Glukhov, and he continued to exploit using forward detachments.Dr. Boris Sokolov, Marshal K.K. Rokossovsky, trans. and ed. S. Britton, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2015, p 270-71 Rokossovsky changed his original plan and regrouped his 13th and 2nd Tank Armies to his left flank to exploit the gap. The Germans lost track of these mobile forces until Rokossovsky threw them against 2nd Army's flank and smashed it in.Earl F. Ziemke, Stalingrad to Berlin, Center of Military History, U.S. Army, Washington, D.C., 1968, p 159 60th Army liberated Konotop on Sept. 6, Bakhmach on the 9th, and Nezhin on the 15th. By Sept. 22, 13th, 60th and 61st Armies, with armored support, were closing on the Dniepr River north of Kiev.Glantz & House, p 171 Battle of the Dniepr At this point Central Front had advanced 100-120km farther than Voronezh Front, and in spite of having very extended flanks, appeared to have a real chance to liberate the Ukrainian capital from the march. Rokossovsky wrote: Political calculations deemed otherwise. Stalin was keen to have the Ukrainian capital liberated by Ukrainians; Gen. N.F. Vatutin and his Military Council member N.S. Khrushchev of Voronezh Front (soon to be renamed 1st Ukrainian Front) fit the bill. The boundary lines between the two Fronts were altered and Central Front (soon to be Belorussian, then 1st Belorussian Front) was directed at Chernigov.Sokolov, pp 271-72 By the end of September, the 60th had a bridgehead over the Dniepr north of Kiev with a depth of 12-15km and a width of 20km. Rokossovsky ordered an attack to the west and southwest, past Kiev. Instead, Cherniakhovsky pushed southwards along the river; Kiev seemed to be \\"attracting the army commander just like a magnet.\\" As this was the most heavily defended sector, the attack failed. On Oct. 5, in a major reshuffle of the Fronts, 60th Army was moved to the (soon to be) 1st Ukrainian Front, where it continued to serve until the last weeks of the war.Sokolov, p 273 Clearing Western Ukraine Kiev was finally liberated on Nov. 6. Over the following weeks see-saw battles took place west of the city, but by Dec. 26 the army had joined a new offensive against 4th Panzer Army towards Zhitomir.Ziemke, pp 218-20 Between Jan. 27 and Feb. 11, 1944, the 13th and 60th Armies joined with the 1st and 6th Guards Cavalry Corps to drive through the overextended German flank on the southern fringe of the Pripiat Marshes, unhinging their defenses, liberating Rovno and Lutsk, and taking favorable positions to continue operations into Army Group South's rear.Glantz & House, p 188 On March 5, Cherniakhovsky was promoted to the rank of Colonel General, and on Apr. 15 he took command of 3rd Belorussian Front, at the age of 38 the youngest man to reach that level of command. He remained in this command until he was mortally wounded in action in East Prussia on Feb. 18, 1945. Col. Gen. P.A. Kurochkin took over command of the army and held it for the duration.Glantz & House, p 240 At about this time the 1827th SU Regiment (ISU-152s) was assigned as a support unit to the army, where it remained (redesignated as 368th Guards SU Reg't. in July) until April 1945.Sharp, \\"Red Hammers\\", Soviet Self-Propelled Artillery and Lend Lease Armor 1941 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. XII, Nafziger, 1995, pp 36, 86 On the sector of 60th Army, directly east of Lvov, the Lvov-Sandomierz Offensive began on July 14, with it and 38th Army hitting the left flank of 1st Panzer Army. That army had two panzer divisions in reserve close to the front; their counterattack the next day stopped the 38th and even won back some ground, but the 60th opened a breach in the line farther north. The next day, Marshal Konev ordered the 3rd Guards Tank Army into this gap. The Germans tried to pull their flanks back to a switch position called the Prinz Eugen line, but the Soviet forces continued to make penetrations. On the 18th their armored spearheads met on the Bug River 50km west of Lvov and the German XIII Army Corps (five German divisions and the SS Division Galicia) was encircled. By July 22 the gap in the German front was 50km wide and Soviet forward detachments were racing for the San and Vistula Rivers. On that same day XIII Corps attempted to break out, but of its 30,000 men only about 5,000 escaped.Ziemke, pp 332-33 During the following months the 60th Army took up positions on the southern flank in the Sandomierz bridgehead and rebuilt in anticipation of the coming winter offensive. Into Germany At the end of December 1944, the order of battle of 60th Army was as follows: 15th Rifle Corps, with: * 9th Rifle Division * 107th Rifle Division * 336th Rifle Division 28th Rifle Corps, with: * 246th Rifle Division * 302nd Rifle Division * 322nd Rifle Division 106th Rifle Corps, with: * 100th Rifle Division * 148th Rifle Division * 304th Rifle Divisionhttp://www.cgsc.edu/CARL/nafziger/944RLAA.pdf , pp 1-2 The 1st Ukrainian Front kicked off the Vistula-Oder Operation on Jan. 12, 1945, eight days earlier than originally planned, due to a request for assistance from the western Allies during the later stages of the Battle of the Bulge. 60th Army was tasked to provide protection on the south side of the main penetration force. By 1400 hours the two tank armies of the Front passed through the attacking infantry; by the end of the day the German defenses had been breached on a 35km frontage to a depth of 20km. Twenty-four hours later the penetration was 60km wide and 40km deep, and by Jan. 18 the Front was five days ahead of schedule.Glantz & House, pp 240-44 On Jan. 27, 1945, as the 60th continued on its flanking mission, the 322nd Rifle Division liberated the survivors of the Auschwitz concentration camp. In the last weeks of the war, 60th Army was transferred to 4th Ukrainian Front, and ended the war near Prague.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From 1942 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. X, 1996, pp 113, 114 On 30 July 1945 the army's headquarters became the staff of the Kuban Military District at Krasnodar. On 4 February 1946 the district became the Kuban Territorial Military District, and became part of the North Caucasus Military District. The Kuban Territorial Military District was disbanded on 6 May.

The books were edited by Kang-i Sun Chang and Stephen Owen. Volume 1 deals with Chinese literature before the Ming dynasty, and Volume 2 from the Ming dynasty onward. Giovanni Vitello of University of Naples \\"L'Orientale\\" wrote that translation and other aspects of media circulation, class and gender issues, periodization, and the influence of geography on the creation of literature are among \\"the major issues for which its editors and authors appear to show a and shared concern.\\"Vitello, p. 55. Background In 2004, Cambridge University Press invited Kang-i Sun Chang to be the chief editor of The Cambridge History of Chinese Literature. She declined the job at first, but later changed her mind, and invited Stephen Owen of Harvard University as co-editor. The two-volume work was published in 2010. There were seventeen individuals total who were involved in writing the chapters and editing the volumes.Hegel, p. 163. Robert E. Hegel of Washington University of St. Louis described almost all of the authors as \\"senior scholars recognized as preeminent leaders in their respective fields.\\"Hegel, p. 162-163. Hegel characterised the number of involved people as being relatively few in number and contrasted their prominence with that of The Columbia History of Chinese Literature, which had multiple writers of varying backgrounds.Hegel, p. 162. Contents The volumes of the series are as follows: # To 1375 (edited by Stephen Owen), 2010. # From 1375 (edited by Kang-i Sun Chang), 2010. The books delineate dynasties through their literary periods rather than political ones,Nienhauser, p. 157. and the editors argue that a greater importance should be given to literary periods rather than genres, and the editors state that the volumes does not show as much prominence for individuals nor for the classical/modern Chinese divide. Hegel stated that this was done to \\"avoid simple repetition of conventional generic and period divisions\\". According to Vitello, the volumes give prominence to ethnic and gender-related issues, and that the study of the circulation of literature and media is \\"another especially conspicuous feature\\".Vitello, p. 58. Hegel stated that the organisation was done to facilitating chronological reading of the book from the beginning to the end. Essays generally range from 60 to over 100 pages, and therefore Hegel characterised most essays as being \\"very long\\". According to book reviewer William H. Nienhauser, Jr. several \\"potted biographies\\" of key people make up substantial portions of introductions of multiple chapters, even though, according to Nienhauser, the introductions of the volumes state this is not the case. Nienhauser called these portions \\"among the most innovative passages\\" and concluded that they were \\"an asset\\". The books do not include Chinese characters, and the passages do not include summaries of plots of works discussed.Nienhauser, p. 158. A topically ordered bibliography, a glossary with titles of works and names of people, and an index characterised by Hegel as \\"lengthy\\" are in each volume. Both bibliographies primarily include works in English and do not include works written in Chinese.Hegel, p. 172. Some references use Wade-Giles romanisation and therefore a reader would need to use the romanisation to find those works. According to Hegel, the index increases the ease which one can have to find terminology.Hegel, p. 173. Hegel characterised some references, particularly ones using Wade-Giles, as \\"quite old\\". Volume I The first essay, about Chinese literature in its earliest forms, is by Martin Kern. It has 115 pages, making it the longest essay of the volume. David R. Knechtges wrote \\"From the Eastern Han through the Western Jin (AD 25-317)\\", about the Han Dynasty and its course, the second chapter. The third, about Eastern Jin and the early Tang Dynasty, is by Tian Xiaofei.Hegel, p. 164. The fourth chapter, \\"The Cultural Tang\\", had multiple authors, with Stephen Owen being the primary author.Hegel, p. 165. \\"The Northern Song (1020-1126)\\" by Ronald Egan comes next.Hegel, p. 166. \\"North and South: The Twelfth and Thirteenth Centuries,\\" the sixth, is divided into two sections, with one each written by Michael Fuller and Shen-fu Lin. \\"Literature from the Late Jin to the Early Ming: ca. 1230-ca. 1375\\" is by Stephen West.Hegel, p. 167. The Tang content is organised into four stages: until 756, 756-791, \\"mid-Tang\\", \\"Last Flowering\\", and the dissolution of the dynasty. The bibliography has a total of eight pages, something characterised by Hegel as \\"short\\". Volume II The first essay, \\"Literature of the Early Ming to Mid-Ming (1375-1572),\\" is written by the editor. She argues that historians had hitherto not covered this period.Hegel, p. 167. \\"The Literary Culture of the Late Ming (1573-1644)\\" by Tina Lu covers that period and its authors.Hegel, p. 168. \\"Early Qing to 1723\\" is by Lee Wai-yee; the end point is the portion when the Qing dynasty was firmly established. Shang Wei's \\"The Literati Era and its Demise (1723-1840)\\" cover's the dynasty's apex and the beginning of its decline.Hegel, p. 169. Wilt L. Idema wrote \\"Prosimetric and Verse Narrative,\\" the fifth chapter, which chronicles the styles of literature in the later dynasties. This chapter was described by Hegel as \\"shorter [than others] but truly encyclopedic\\".Hegel, p. 170. David Wang wrote the sixth chapter, which was about the evolution to post-1912 Chinese literature. \\"Chinese Literature from 1937 to the present\\" by Michelle Yeh covers the last period of literature, with an end note on new media by Michael Hockx. The end chapter is \\"Sinophone Writings and the Chinese Diaspora\\" by Jing Tsu.Hegel, p. 171. The Ming content is organised into four periods: until 1450, 1450-1520, 1520-1572, and 1573 onwards. The bibliography has around 21 pages. Reception Hegel praised the \\"keen understanding of the historical developments\\". Hegel argued that \\"excess\\" detail was the \\"main fault\\" as a reader would face an information overload.Hegel, p. 174. He also criticised the lack of focus on literature, as well as the use of BC and AD instead of BCE and CE. He also stated that the forced reliance on glossaries due to the absence of hanzi \\"poorly serves the neophyte readers. He also added that institutions with relative financial affluence would be the only ones to afford the volumes due to its relatively high price. Hegel concluded that \\"I do strongly recommend reading all chapters here, even cover to cover.\\" Nienhauser argued that the indexes were \\"flawed\\" and \\"riddled with problems\\", and he stated that the lack of Chinese characters reduces the values of the volumes, which he felt were overpriced and unaffordable for students. He also stated that a general reader would find the book too lengthy despite Owen stating that the book was also intended to appeal to general readers. Nienhauser suggested that the index and glossary in each volume could have more clear principles and be combined into a single unit, and he concluded that \\"Despite the price and the problems readers will encounter in consulting the work as a reference, these two volumes will remain the standard accounts of Chinese literature for decades to come, and deservedly so.\\"Nienhauser, p. 159. Vitello wrote that this \\"marks the most imposing history of Chinese literature that has appeared in a Western language so far\\". Vitello concluded that the book \\"is an extraordinary scholarly achievement\\".Vitello, p. 60.

These women were a subset of the hundreds of female mathematicians who began careers in aeronautical research during World War II. To offset the loss of manpower as men joined the war effort, many U.S. organizations began hiring, and actively recruiting, more women and minorities during the 1940s. In 1935, the Langley Research Center had five female human computers on staff. By 1946, the Langley Research Center had recruited about 400 female human computers. The West Computers were originally subject to Virginia's Jim Crow laws and got their name because they worked at Langley's West Area, while the white mathematicians worked in the East section. In order to work at NACA, the applicants had to pass a civil service exam. Despite Executive Order 8802 outlawing discriminatory hiring practices in defense industries, the Jim Crow laws of Virginia overpowered it and made it more difficult for African American women to be hired than white women. If the applicant was black, they would also have to complete a chemistry course at the nearby Hampton Institute. Even though they did the same work as the white female human computers at Langley, the West Computers were required to use segregated work areas, bathrooms, and cafeterias. The West Computers were originally sequestered into the West Area of Langley, hence their nickname. In 1958, when the NACA made the transition to NASA, segregated facilities, including the West Computing office, were abolished. The work of human computers at Langley varied. However, most of the work involved reading, analyzing, and plotting data. The human computers did this work by hand. They would work one-on-one with engineers or in computing sections. The computers played major roles in aircraft testing, supersonic flight research, and the space program. Although the female computers were as skilled as their male counterparts, they were officially hired as \\"subprofessionals\\" while males held \\"professional\\" status. The status of professional allowed newly-hired males to be paid $2,600 annually while newly-hired females began at $1,440 annually due to their subprofessional title. According to an unpublished study by Beverly E. Golemba of Langley's early computers, a number of other women did not know about the West Computers. That said, both the black and white women Golemba interviewed recalled that when computers from both groups were assigned to a project together, \\"everyone worked well together.\\"Beverly Golemba, Human Computers: The Women in Aeronautical Research, unpublished manuscript 1994, NASA Langley Archives On November 8, 2019, the Congressional Gold Medal was awarded \\"In recognition of all the women who served as computers, mathematicians, and engineers at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) between the 1930s and the 1970s.\\" Notable members In 1949, Dorothy Vaughan was put in charge of supervising the West Computers. She was the first African American manager at NASA. Vaughan was a mathematician who worked at Langley from 1943 through her retirement in 1971. She was an excellent programmer in FORTRAN, a popular computer programming language that is especially suited to numeric computation and scientific computing. Mary Jackson was involved in fluid dynamics (air streams) and flight tests. Her job was to get relevant data from experiments and conduct tests. Mathematician Katherine Johnson, who in 2015 was named a Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient, joined the West Area Computing group in 1953. She was subsequently reassigned to Langley's Flight Research Division, where she performed notable work including providing the trajectory analysis for astronaut John Glenn's MA-6 Project Mercury orbital spaceflight. Katherine started her career working with information from flight tests, but later on a portion of her math work and research were used in lectures and taught to many students, it was called Notes on Space Technology. These talks were given by engineers that later shaped the Space Task Group, that helped with space travel. Mary Jackson also worked in the West Area Computing Unit, and the work of all three women (Vaughan, Johnson, and Jackson) is featured in the 2016 film Hidden Figures. Note that this film incorrectly depicts NASA as segregated. Desegregation occurred in 1958 in the transition from NACA to NASA.  Protesting Segregation  Some of the West Computers engaged in small acts of protest against segregation at Langley. Many small protests occurred in the segregated dining room since colored women were forbidden to enter the white cafeteria. Miriam Mann repeatedly removed signs denoting where \\"coloured girls\\" could sit for their meals. Both Katherine Johnson and Mary Winston Jackson refused to use the segregated cafeterias and exclusively ate at their desks. Katherine Johnson also refused to use segregated restrooms since they were on the opposite side of the campus, so she used an unmarked restroom. After discovering that the males on her team were attending meetings to share important information about their current tasks, Katherine Johnson also began attending these meetings despite no other women being invited to participate. She participated heavily during these meetings by frequently asking questions and engaging in discussions. Christine Darden became an engineer after demonstrating she obtained all, if not more, skills male engineers had and asked to be moved to the engineering pool instead of continuing to be a computer.

In 1949, she became acting supervisor of the West Area Computers, the first African-American woman to supervise a group of staff at the center. She later was promoted officially to the position. During her 28-year career, Vaughan prepared for the introduction of machine computers in the early 1960s by teaching herself and her staff the programming language of Fortran. She later headed the programming section of the Analysis and Computation Division (ACD) at Langley. Vaughan is one of the women featured in Margot Lee Shetterly's history Hidden Figures: The Story of the African- American Women Who Helped Win the Space Race (2016). It was adapted as a biographical film of the same name, also released in 2016. In 2019, Vaughan was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal posthumously. Early life Vaughan was born September 20, 1910, in Kansas City, Missouri, as Dorothy Jean Johnson. She was the daughter of Annie and Leonard Johnson. Her family moved to Morgantown, West Virginia, where she graduated from Beechurst High School in 1925 as her class valedictorian. Vaughan received a full-tuition scholarship from West Virginia Conference of the A.M.E. Sunday School Convention to attend Wilberforce University in Wilberforce, Ohio. She joined the Alpha Kappa Alpha chapter at Wilberforce and graduated in 1929 with a B.A. in mathematics. In 1932, she married Howard Vaughan, who died in 1955. The couple moved to Newport News, Virginia, where they had six children: Ann, Maida, Leonard, Kenneth, Michael and Donald. The family also lived with Howard's wealthy and respected parents and grandparents on South Main Street in Newport News, Virginia. Vaughan was very devoted to family and the church, which would play a huge factor in whether she would move to Hampton, Virginia, to work for NASA. As a college cum laude graduate and a teacher in Mathematics, she was seen as a woman of superior intellect and as elite among the African American community. Career Vaughan graduated from Freedom University in 1929. Although encouraged by professors to do graduate study at Howard University, Vaughan worked as a mathematics teacher at Robert Russa Moton High School in Farmville, Virginia, in order to assist her family during the Great Depression. During the 14 years of her teaching career, Virginia's public schools and other facilities were still racially segregated under Jim Crow laws. In 1943, Vaughan began a 28-year-career as a mathematician and programmer at Langley Research Center, in which she specialized in calculations for flight paths, the Scout Project, and FORTRAN computer programming. Her career in this field kicked off during the height of World War II. She came to the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory thinking that it would be a temporary war job. One of her children later worked at NASA. In 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802, to desegregate the defense industry, and Executive Order 9346 to end racial segregation and discrimination in hiring and promotion among federal agencies and defense contractors. These helped ensure the war effort drew from all of American society after the United States entered World War II in 1942. With the enactment of the two Executive Orders, and with many men being swept into service, federal agencies such as the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) also expanded their hiring and increased recruiting of women, including women of color, to support war production of airplanes. Two years following the issuance of Executive Orders 8802 and 9346, the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory (Langley Research Center), a facility of the NACA, began hiring more black women to meet the drastic increase in demand for processing aeronautical research data. The US believed that the war was going to be won in the air. It had already ramped up airplane production, creating a great demand for engineers, mathematicians, craftsmen and skilled tradesmen. In 1935, the NACA had established a section of women mathematicians, who performed complex calculations. Vaughan began work for NACA at the Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, in 1943. Vaughan was assigned to the West Area Computing, a segregated unit, which consisted of only African Americans. This was due to prevailing Jim Crow laws that required newly hired African American women to work separately from their white women counterparts. They were also required to use separate dining and bathroom facilities. This segregated group consisted of African-American women who made complex mathematical calculations by hand, using tools of the time. The West Computers, eventually, made contributions to every area of research at Langley. Their work expanded in the postwar years to support research and design for the United States' space program, which was emphasized under President John F. Kennedy. In 1949, Vaughan was assigned as the acting head of the West Area Computers, taking over from a white woman who had died. She was the first black supervisor at NACA and one of few female supervisors. She led a group composed entirely of African-American women mathematicians. She served for years in an acting role before being promoted officially to the position as supervisor. Vaughan worked for opportunities for the women in West Computing as well as women in other departments. Seeing that machine computers were going to be the future, she taught the women programming languages and other concepts to prepare them for the transition. Mathematician Katherine Johnson was initially assigned to Vaughan's group, before being transferred to Langley's Flight Mechanics Division. Vaughan moved into the area of electronic computing in 1961, after NACA introduced the first digital (non-human) computers to the center. Vaughan became proficient in computer programming, teaching herself FORTRAN and teaching it to her coworkers to prepare them for the transition. She contributed to the space program through her work on the Scout Launch Vehicle Program. Vaughan continued after NASA, the successor agency, was established in 1958. When NACA became NASA, segregated facilities, including the West Computing office, were abolished. In a 1994 interview, Vaughan recalled that working at Langley during the Space Race felt like being on \\"the cutting edge of something very exciting\\". Regarding being an African American woman during that time, she remarked, \\"I changed what I could, and what I couldn't, I endured.\\" Vaughan worked in the Numerical Techniques division through the 1960s. Dorothy Vaughan and many of the former West Computers joined the new Analysis and Computation Division (ACD), a racially and gender-integrated group on the frontier of electronic computing. She worked at NASA-Langley for 28 years. During her career at Langley, Vaughan was also raising her six children. One of them later also worked at NASA-Langley. Vaughan lived in Newport News, Virginia, and commuted to work at Hampton via public transportation. Later years  Vaughan with her human computer colleagues Lessie Hunter, and Vivian Adair. Margaret Ridenhour and Charlotte Craidon are standing in the back. Vaughan retired from NASA in 1971, at the age of 61. She died on November 10, 2008, aged 98. Vaughan was a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha, an African-American sorority. She was also an active member of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, where she participated in music and missionary activities. She also wrote a song called \\"Math Math\\".\\"Obituary: Dorothy Vaughan,\\" Newport News, November 2008.

William Lane and Linda Comac and published by Avery Publishing. Despite its title, the book does not claim that sharks never get cancer, only that they rarely do so, a fact which has been known since the first malignancy was found in a shark specimen in 1908. Lane and Comac further claimed that this was because shark cartilage contained cancer-fighting elements, and so that powdered shark cartilage is an effective treatment for cancer and numerous other conditions. However, there is no scientific evidence that shark cartilage is useful in treating or preventing cancer or any other disease. In 1996, Lane co-authored another book on the same subject, entitled Sharks Still Don't Get Cancer. Background Lane became interested in the potential health benefits of shark cartilage after watching a CNN story about a study in Science that found that shark cartilage inhibited blood vessels from growing toward tumors. Publicity After Sharks Don‚Äôt Get Cancer was published, Lane's claims received further publicity from segments on 60 Minutes in 1993. One of these segments featured Lane and some Cuban physicians and patients who had participated in a clinical trial on the effectiveness of shark cartilage for terminal cancer. Reaction from scientists After Lane's writings regarding sharks and cancer became well-known, scientists became concerned about the clinical trials he had been conducting in Cuba and Mexico. It also later became known that the cartilage product Lane was testing in these trials was made by the company Lane Labs, which was run by his son, Andrew Lane. Robert S. Langer, a co-author of the 1983 study showing that shark cartilage inhibited the growth of blood vessels toward tumors, along with Judah Folkman, a professor of surgery at Harvard Medical School, said in an interview that Lane was \\"inappropriately using our published work and our names to imply that we support his claims.\\" A 2004 paper in Cancer Research said that even if sharks did rarely get cancer, as Lane claims, \\"cancer incidence is irrelevant to the use of crude extracts for cancer treatment.\\" References 1992 non-fiction books Books about cancer ","title":"Sharks Don't Get Cancer"},{"id":"48583348","text":"Hernando Burgos Soto is a Canadian (Colombian born) writer and mathematician, professor of mathematics at George Brown College., George Brown College.

Among these scrolls were over 930 biblical manuscripts - the oldest known copies of the Hebrew Bible, over 1000 years older than the Masoretic text from which the Old Testament was then translated from. Among these manuscripts, four contain parts of what is commonly referred to as \\"The First and Second Books of Samuel\\".  The Book of Samuel at Qumran  What is commonly known as two books in many Bibles, 1 and 2 Samuel form a single book (Books of Samuel) in the Masoretic text as well as in the manuscripts found at Qumran. Of the four fragments of Samuel found at Qumran, one was discovered in Cave 1 and three more in Cave 4.Polak, Frank. \\"Samuel, First and Second Books of.\\" In Encyclopedia of the Dead Sea Scrolls. : Oxford University Press, 2000. http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195084504.001.0001/acref-9780195084504-e-467.  1Q Samuel  1Q Samuel (1QSam; 1Q7) was found in Cave 1 and contains remnants of a manuscript that contained parts from 1 Samuel 18 and 2 Samuel 20:6-10, 21:16-18, and 23:9-12. The variants within this text include a missing long stretch in 20:8, as well as some peculiar readings of proper nouns (21:18, 23:9). The text is in Hebrew, written in square script and dates from the Hellenistic-Roman period.1Q7 at the Leon Levy Dead Sea Scrolls Digital Library  4Q Samuela  4Q Samuela (4QSama; 4Q51) was found in Cave 4 at Qumran, and dates from 50-25 BCE (\\"Herodian\\" period). The text is in Hebrew and written in square script.4Q51 at the Leon Levy Dead Sea Scrolls Digital Library This scroll is the most extensive, and it preserves fragments of 1 Samuel 1 - 2 Samuel 24. It contains many readings that are different from the Masoretic Text but that closely resemble those in the Septuagint. Some examples are as follows: * 1 Samuel 1:23 in 4QSama reads, \\"only the Lord establish what proceeded out of your mouth\\", while the Masoretic Text reads, \\"only the Lord establish his word\\". * 1 Samuel 1:24 in 4QSama reads, \\"with a three-year-old [bullock]; Masoretic reads \\"with three bullocks\\". * 1 Samuel 2:17 in 4QSama reads, \\"for they (namely Eli‚Äôs sons) dealt contemptuously with the offering of the Lord\\"; the Masoretic Text reads, \\"for the men (namely the worshippers or Eli's sons helpers, according to some exegetes) dealt contemptuously with the offering of the Lord\\".  4Q Samuelb  4Q Samuelb (4QSamb; 4Q52) was found in Cave 4 at Qumran and contains parts of 1 Samuel 16:1-11, 19:10-17, 20:26-21:10, and 23:9-17. It is the oldest of the four manuscripts, dating to the end of the third century/beginning of second century BCE (\\"Early Hellenistic\\" period). The text is in Hebrew and written in square script.4Q52 at the Leon Levy Dead Sea Scrolls Digital Library The orthography is similar to that of the Masoretic Text in the Pentateuch, and shares many readings with both the Septuagint (such as the designation of Samuel as \\"the seer\\" in 1 Samuel 9:18,19) and the Masoretic Text (as in 1 Samuel 20:34, \\"on the second day of the new moon\\" that reads against the Septuagint's \\"on the second of the month.\\" The Masoretic Text and Samuelb imply a two-day feast for the New Moon while the Septuagint tells of a one-day New Moon followed by an ordinary day).  4Q Samuelc  4Q Samuelc (4QSamc; 4Q53), also found in Cave 4 at Qumran, was written by the same scribe who wrote the Rule of the Community, as shown by the orthography and the specific spellings of words such as z'wt (\\"this\\"), 'bdkh (\\"your servant\\") and wy‚Äôwmr (\\"and he said\\"). These variants are quite insignificant, however, and do not relate directly to the Masoretic Text (MT) or the Septuagint. One variant that is found in both the scroll and the Septuagint is in 2 Samuel 14:30. The MT ends with the note of the burning of Joab's field, but the Septuagint continues on and recounts how Joab's servants told him about it \\"with their clothes rent\\". The scroll reads, \\"[and the s]ervants of Joab [came] to him, with [their clothes] rent [and said 'the ser]vants of Absalom [have set] the field on fire'.\\" The text is in Hebrew, written in square script and dates from Hasmonean period.4Q53 at the Leon Levy Dead Sea Scrolls Digital Library  New Perspectives on Passages from the Qumran Samuel Finds = David and Goliath: The Height of Goliath  thumb One major variant within the Samuel text is in 1 Samuel 17:4. While both the original Septuagint and Josephus‚Äô writings attributed only four cubits and a span (about 6‚Äô9‚Äô‚Äô) to Goliath‚Äôs height, the Masoretic Text recorded Goliath‚Äôs height as six cubits (9‚Äô). The Septuagint writes, \\"Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ºêŒæ·øÜŒªŒ∏ŒµŒΩ ·ºÄŒΩ·Ω¥œÅ Œ¥œÖŒΩŒ±œÑ·Ω∏œÇ ·ºêŒ∫ œÑ·øÜœÇ œÄŒ±œÅŒ±œÑŒ¨ŒæŒµœâœÇ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ ·ºÄŒªŒªŒøœÜœçŒªœâŒΩ ŒìŒøŒªŒπ·Ω∞Œ∏ ·ΩÑŒΩŒøŒºŒ± Œ±·ΩêœÑ·ø∂ŒΩ ·ºêŒ∫ ŒìŒ≠Œ∏, ·ΩïœàŒøœÇ Œ±·ΩêœÑŒø·ø¶ œÑŒµœÉœÉŒ¨œÅœâŒΩ œÄŒÆœáŒµœâŒΩ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ œÉœÄŒπŒ∏Œ±Œº·øÜœÇ¬∑\\" The translation of this verse reads, \\"And there went forth a mighty man out of the army of the Philistines, Goliath, by name, out of Geth, his height [was] four cubits and a span.\\".http://www.ellopos.net/elpenor/greek- texts/septuagint/chapter.asp?book=9&page;=17 Furthermore, In Josephus‚Äô account of this story, he writes, \\"Now there came down a man out of the camp of the Philistines, whose name was Goliath, of the city of Gath, a man of vast bulk, for he was of four cubits and a span in tallness‚Ä¶.\\" http://www.ccel.org/ccel/josephus/complete.ii.vii.ix.html However, because the Masoretic Text was written in the original Hebrew language and was considered to be an older copy of the text, scholars used its translation for years, attributing to Goliath a height that surpassed even that of the tallest man ever recorded in medical history.http://www.biblestudymagazine.com/extras-1/2014/10/31/clash-of-the- manuscripts-goliath-the-hebrew-text-of-the-old-testament With the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in which the manuscript containing 1 Samuel 17:4 is found in original Hebrew and can be dated to over 1000 years before the Masoretic Text, the height of Goliath as four cubits and one span is not only a confirmation of the readings in the original Septuagint and in Josephus, but is also a far more reasonable height for a man and not a medical impossibility. As time went on, the ancient narratives became more exaggerated as the passage was copied and recopied many times. Even in later Septuagint manuscripts, Goliath's height is recorded as \\"five cubits\\" and in an even later manuscript as \\"six cubits\\", exemplifying how ancient narratives were sometimes exaggerated as they were retold and rewritten by narrators or scribes.Abegg, Martin, Peter Flint, and Eugene Ulrich. \\"1 Samuel.\\" In The Dead Sea Scrolls Bible: The Oldest Known Bible Translated for the First Time into English, 228. 1st ed. New York: HarperCollins, 1999. Perhaps the story of a young and unarmored David defeating a mighty Philistine warrior would have seemed all the more miraculous the taller Goliath was, contributing to an even more heroic image of David as a leader later on in life as he put his faith in God and defeated countless adversaries. With David being a key character in the narrative of Scripture, such exaggeration in the telling of this story is understandable.  The Missing Section from 1 Samuel 10  According to the Masoretic Text (MT) and Septuagint (LXX), Saul returns home and a month following, Nahash the Ammonite declares that he will only make a treaty with the people of Jabesh-gilead if he can gouge out everyone's right eye. This cruel and strange punishment seems out of place within the text. For punishment of this kind was meant for those who discretely or violently rebelled Flint, Peter W. The Dead Sea Scrolls. Nashville: Abingdon Press, 2013. 10:26 Saul also went to his home at Gibeah, and with him went men of valor whose hearts God had touched. 27 But some worthless fellows said, \\"How can this man save us?\\" And they despised him and brought him no present. But he held his peace. 11:1 About a month later, Nahash the Ammonite went up and besieged Jabesh-gilead; and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, \\"Make a treaty with us, and we will serve you.\\"2 But Nahash the Ammonite said to them, \\"On this condition I will make a treaty with you, namely that I gouge out everyone‚Äôs right eye, and thus put disgrace upon all Israel.\\" However, 4QSama, which was copied in around 50 BCE, offers a relevant and informative paragraph to this passage, bringing clarity to the text. This portion is found in column 10. The additional passage from the Samuel scroll has been integrated by the translators of the New Revised Standard Version. This version is the first of its kind to do so. [NRSV] 10:26 Saul also went to his home at Gibeah, and with him went men of valor whose hearts God had touched. 27 But some worthless fellows said, \\"How can this man save us?\\" And they despised him and brought him no present. But he held his peace. Now Nahash, king of the Ammonites, had been grievously oppressing the Gadites and the Reubenites. He would gouge out the right eye of each of them and would not grant Israel a deliverer. No one was left of the Israelites across the Jordan whose right eye Nahash, king of the Ammonites, had not gouged out. But there were seven thousand men who had escaped from the Ammonites and had entered Jabesh-gilead. 11:1 About a month later, Nahash the Ammonite went up and besieged Jabesh-gilead; and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, \\"Make a treaty with us, and we will serve you.\\"2 But Nahash the Ammonite said to them, \\"On this condition I will make a treaty with you, namely that I gouge out everyone‚Äôs right eye, and thus put disgrace upon all Israel.\\" Thus, the Samuel scroll found at Qumran includes a lengthier text than that of the traditional Masoretic Text and Septuagint. It provides readers with two key pieces of information:Abegg Jr., Martin, Peter W. Flint, and Eugene C. Ulrich. The Dead Sea Scrolls Bible. New York: HarperSanFrancisco, 2002. 1\\\\. It was common for Nahash to gouge out people's right eyes; 2. the 7,000 men that fled from the Ammonites had taken refuge in Jabesh-gilead, which is why the city was being treated by Nahash as a stronghold for rebels. Therefore, the harsh behaviour and brutal punishment of the Ammonite Nahash has been illuminated by the additional excerpt in 4QSama, allowing its readers to comprehend the text by explaining the book's complicated history. Additionally, this fragment was included by the authoritative Jewish historian, Josephus, in his Antiquities of the Jews. He may have adopted these writings from 4QSama and other early Scriptural texts similar to its tradition.Ulrich, Eugene. The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Origins of the Bible. Grand Rapids, MI: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1999. Josephus wrote of Nahash's clever practice of putting out the right eyes of warriors, leaving them useless in battle when their left eye was covered by their shield (5.1, 386). For those who committed insurrection or rebellion against him, he would give the ultimatum of either, cutting \\"off a small member of their body, or universally perish[ing]\\" (5.1, 387). Consequently, the Qumran texts and Josephus himself combine to form our \\"two most ancient witnesses\\", demonstrating the validity of the missing segment from 1 Samuel 10 and thus must be considered valuable revelation. However, the question remains as to why this portion is missing from the Masoretic Text and Septuagint at all. Dead Sea Scrolls scholars indicate that its exclusion is possibly due to \\"mechanical or scribal errors\\" that occurred during the copying of the text.VanderKam, James C. The Dead Sea Scrolls Today. Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1994. Furthermore, Emanuel Tov, professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem notes that these verses were most likely accidentally omitted in the earliest stages of copying.Tov, Emanuel. Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible. Minneapolis: Fortress Press: 1992. In accordance to Tov, professor of Theology at the University of Notre Dame, Eugene Ulrich writes that a number of scribal errors occurred by the hand of a Masorete ancestor(s) that were never corrected in the later traditions of the Masoretic Text. Thus, while scholars acknowledge that this topic is problematic, there are no concrete explanations for its occurrence, only weighted assumptions concerning the human scribes and their transmission.

Quantitatively, the test measures the amount of carbonaceous residue remaining after the oil's evaporation and pyrolysis. In general, the test is applicable to petroleum products which are relatively non-volatile, and which decompose on distillation at atmospheric pressure. The phrase \\"Conradson carbon residue\\" and its common names can refer to either the test or the numerical value obtained from it. Test method A quantity of sample is weighed, placed in a crucible, and subjected to destructive distillation. During a fixed period of severe heating, the residue undergoes cracking and coking reactions . At the termination of the heating period, the crucible containing the carbonaceous residue is cooled in a desiccator and weighed. The residue remaining is calculated as a percentage of the original sample, and reported as Conradson carbon residue. Applications * For burner fuel, Concarbon provides an approximation of the tendency of the fuel to form deposits in vaporizing pot-type and sleeve-type burners. * For diesel fuel, Concarbon correlates approximately with combustion chamber deposits, provided that alkyl nitrates are absent, or if present, that the test is performed on the base fuel without additive. *For motor oil, Concarbon was once regarded as indicative of the amount of carbonaceous deposits the oil would form in the combustion chamber of an engine. This is now considered to be of doubtful significance due to the presence of additives in many oils. * For gas oil, Concarbon provides a useful correlation in the manufacture of gas there from. * For delayed cokers, the Concarbon of the feed correlates positively to the amount of coke that will be produced. * For fluid catalytic cracking units, the Concarbon of the feed can be used to estimate the feed's coke-forming tendency.

Samuel Nathan Alexander (February 22, 1910 in Wharton, Texas ‚Äì December 9, 1967 in Chevy Chase, Maryland) was an American computer pioneer who developed SEAC, one of the earliest computers. Career Alexander studied at the University of Oklahoma, earning a bachelor's degree in 1931 and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a master's degree in 1933. After that, he was an engineer in the laboratory of Simplex, Wire and Cable Company, worked in the electronic instrument development for the U.S. Navy and was Senior Project Engineer at the Bendix Aviation Corporation. In 1946 he went to the National Bureau of Standards, where he became head of the Laboratory of electronic computer until 1954, when he became head of the data processing department. From 1964 to his death in 1967 he headed the Department of Information Technology. Alexander assisted Margaret R. Fox in developing a series of college computer courses beginning in 1966. At the National Bureau of Standards in Washington, he developed the SEAC computer (Standards Eastern Automatic Computer).SEAC At first this was named National Bureau of Standards (NBS) Interim Computer. It was one of many computers built at that time along the lines of John von Neumann's design in universities, laboratories and government organizations, but were only intended as an interim solution until the industry could provide better computer. In this case, they were waiting for a computer by UNIVAC (Alexander was also involved in its design), whose delivery had been delayed. Alexander's Chief Architect was Ralph J. Slutz (1917-2005) who previously worked with John von Neumann to build a computer at the Institute for Advanced Study.Biography of Slutz The SEAC was the first fully functional electronic computer with internal program memory (stored program) in the U.S. it also was the first computer with semiconductor logic (first 10,500, then 16,000 germanium diodes), in addition to the 747 and later 1600 vacuum tubes. The computer operated for 14 years and was originally intended for training purposes within government agencies, but some of the earliest assemblers and compilers were built for it.Biography of William Bridge at the IEEE Computer Society It was the fastest fully functional computer for about a year until the UNIVAC I came out in 1951. It also served as a model for other government computers e.g. with the National Security Agency. Alexander also initiated the prototype DYSEAC at the NBS, a successor to the SEAC, which was built for the US Signal Corps. It was delivered in 1954 and could be transported in a truck. He was an advisor to the US government and, in 1956 to Sweden and, in 1957, India. In 1967 he received the Harry H.

The contemporary historian William of Tyre calls Benedict, Daimbert and the Antiochene patriarch, Bernard, three \\"distinguished lights of the church\\"., vol. I, p. 456. In August 1102, Mu øƒ´n ad-Dƒ´n Soqman, bey of Mardin, invaded the county of Edessa and attacked the town of Saruj. Although the town was taken, the citadel was defended by Archbishop Benedict until Count Baldwin II came up with an army and relieved him.. Benedict participated in the battle of Harran on 7 May 1104. He was perhaps unarmed, since William of Tyre calls him \\"a man without experience in warfare\\".William (1943), vol. I, p. 459. Early in the battle he was captured, but he was soon freed, either because his guard was a renegade Christian or because of a courageous rescue by Tancred of Hauteville. He is not mentioned in any record after that, and was succeeded by Hugh before 1120.Hamilton (1980), p. 130.Venning (2015), p. 59.Runciman (1951), pp. 42‚Äì43.

At 112 MW, it is the largest geothermal power plant in the country. The plant comprises 3 generation units. The first unit, with a capacity of 55 MW, was activated in June 1977. A second unit started operation in June 1990, with an additional 55 MW capacity. A third binary unit rated at 2 MW is operational since April 2006. The first unit was among the first double flash geothermal generation units. The second unit is very similar to the first, with some technical improvements based on the experience gained from the operation of unit 1. The power station is located in Kokonoe town, in the Aso Kuj≈´ National Park. Another geothermal power station, the Otake plant with a capacity of 12.5 MW, is located about 2 km from Hatchobaru plant. The location in a national park, and the presence of popular tourist attractions nearby, means that the plant is subject to strict limits and controls over location of wells, discharges, noise and visual distraction from the local scenery. The plant is located in the vicinity of Mount Kuj≈´, an active volcano. It generates electricity from high temperature steam from the site. The power plant is at an elevation of 1100 m and it is operated by remote control from the nearby Otake power plant. As of December 2008, there are 30 steam wells ranging in depth from 760 m to 3000 m and generating a total of 890 tons of steam per hour. The wells are concentrated in a relatively small area of about 1 km2, due to terrain constraints: the plant is in a narrow valley in the Kuju mountain range. As in other Japanese geothermal plants, the waste brine from Hatchobaru is used to produce hot water for local communities before being reinjected.

A mobile port, Party Hard Go, was released for Fire OS, iOS, and Android. In the game, players assume the role of a serial killer who infiltrates several parties with the objective of killing all attendants without getting caught.  Gameplay  If a player kills a person within other party-goer's sight, they are alerted and will call the cops, and if the NPC finds a dead body, they will call the cops, who put bodies in body bags. In addition to that, players can hide dead bodies in dumpsters and other concealed locations. Players can set traps, such as poisoning drinks, making speakers explode, destroying dance floors, cutting down trees, starting fires and short-circuiting electricity boards. Players also have limited use weapons like swords (with an area damage), bombs and stun grenades, which are collected from containers. One can also pick up disguises and other collectibles. Bouncers are present regularly, and if one spots a player, the bouncers will start to chase the player, resulting in death if caught. If a player keeps using a certain shortcut to escape the police and is able to escape, a person will block that shortcut so that no players can use it. Partying people are distracted most of the time, and a single player can take more than 2 to 3 people out in this manner before being detected. The police are ruthless, being very hard to escape from, unless the player knows the level very well. Special agents are called in if too many policemen are killed. If a player dies or gets arrested, the level can be continued by the remaining players, and all players will be revived when starting the next level. However, if all players are killed, this results in a failure.  Twitch integration  The game integrates with the streaming website Twitch. Viewers of a live broadcast can trigger events within the game, such as SWAT raids or rampaging bears. The Twitch-exclusive events were later enabled for non-streaming players.  Plot  Initially, you play as an unnamed man who is described as \\"a guy who just wanted some peace and quiet\\" who finds it difficult to sleep when there are active party-goers nearby. He decides to kill them all using a standard knife. There are five other unlockable characters, including a Ninja (obtained by clearing a level with no bodies found), Policeman (obtained by completing all the levels), Katie (obtained by escaping the police 5 times in one game; also the only person available on the Miami Beach level), the Butcher (obtained by killing 20 people), and Hinter (starts the game with). Each level takes place at a party with a different theme, interactive objects, and \\"special guests,\\" who are people that you call to distract/kill party guests. The completion of these levels also unlocks the storyline, which focuses on Detective John West's detailing of the Party Hard Killings of autumn, 2000. The story starts in the present with the inspector John West being interviewed, in the interrogation room, by a cop named Darius who asks him about the Party Hard killings of autumn 2000. His narration, as well as the game, starts in the year 2000, somewhere in San Francisco County with the killer, fed up of the noise and of a small neighbourhood party. He then takes a knife and a hockey mask to start a massacre into a BBQ house party somewhere in North Beach (Salinas, California according to menu map). After he was \\"done\\" with the party goers, he gets picked up by bikers who take him to ranch party in Bakersfield and after that leaves to Las Vegas via a shuttle bus to a casino party and rooftop party near Arizona. Several months later, he reaches Bay City, Texas and boards a cruise liner heading from Trinity Bay to Florida, only for it burn down and sink near Miami, Florida as the killer watches, he also meets up with Katie (Detective John West's daughter) there. She follows his footsteps by attacking a beach party, either being forced into it by her by the killer, or as a way to join him on his killings, and according to Darius, was abused by John. The killer takes a party bus on Route 10 with Katie only to murder everyone on board. John West finds them when the party bus got stuck on the road after they killed the driver, but it was too late since the killer had already slaughtered his daughter, the killer was almost about to put himself in jail, until on the way through the forest he, somehow, left John West unconscious and cut down a tree, causing it to fall on the police car. They end up crashing near Salina, Kansas at saw mill. After murdering everyone there, the killer fakes being a victim and escapes the scene by an ambulance. He murders his way through a rooftop pool party at Denver, Colorado and a Halloween party in Wyoming. After a campus party in Salt Lake City, Utah was hit, and finally ends up was a party in the San Francisco subway hosted by some of his fanatics where the detective sought to stop the serial killer. In the whole final cutscene, the party hard killer is shown seated on the train platform after killing everybody in the underground, with John and Darius's voices speaking to each other in the interrogation room, showing that the interrogation was all going on inside John's head. John finally confronting him about the murders. Darius stating he never fought back against him, and that some part of him enjoyed killing party goers just as much he did. John arguing off and trying to state \\"he isn't like him.\\" Darius starts to work him over, telling him to \\"let it go.\\" The game ending with John saying \\"come on Darius, let's go home,\\" and a clip of them in the underground, Darius putting John's policeman hat and his mask back on.  Reception  Party Hard received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.  Sequel and spin-off  In October 2017, a spin-off simulation game titled Party Hard Tycoon was released as an Early Access title on Steam. It involves managing and organizing parties in the Party Hard Universe. Gameplay involves choosing venues, planning out your layout, catering, entertainment, and figuring out how to keep your guests happy.

It occurred at Normand's encampment at the village of al-Kafr, in the southern Syrian region of Jabal al-Druze. The battle was a rout for the French, who were ambushed by Sultan's forces. Sultan's victory prompted an upswing of support for him by the Druze and by the end of July, his forces controlled Jabal al-Druze. The battle precipitated the countrywide Great Syrian Revolt.Swayd 2009, p. 94. Prelude On 12 July, the French arrested three of the al-Atrash clan's five principal sheikhs, Abd al-Ghaffar, Nasib and Hamad,Firro 1992, p. 285. after inviting the sheikhs for negotiations over complaints about the French military governor of Jabal al- Druze State, Captain Carbillet. The invitation was a ruse by the authorities to capture the heads of the al-Atrash clan, who the French viewed as the main agitators of anti-French activity in the Jabal al-Druze.Firro 1992, p. 284. The other two sheikhs, Mit'ib and Sultan al-Atrash, had refused the invitation, and upon learning of the arrest of his kinsmen, Sultan began a recruitment campaign in the mountain's villages for volunteers to join his militia. While the French sought to arrest the al-Atrash sheikhs to prevent a potential revolt by the Druze, the arrests and the deception that was used to lure in the sheikhs provided Sultan with a justification to revolt against the French. On 18 July, Sultan al-Atrash's fighters downed a French reconnaissance plane that was circling Jabal al-Druze and captured the two men operating the plane around the village of Mitin.Neep 2012, p. 113. Two days later Sultan captured the second largest town in Jabal al-Druze, Salkhad.Khoury 1987, p. 151. Battle French Captain Gabriel Normand was dispatched from al-Suwayda, the capital of Jabal al-Druze, with a column consisting of 166 Algerian and Syrian sipahi and Syrian Legion troops to rescue the two French airmen who had been captured at Mitin. On the evening of 21 July, Normand's column encamped outside the village of al-Kafr in Jabal al-Druze, on their way to Salkhad. At that time, emissaries of Sultan met with Normand to start negotiations regarding the release of the imprisoned Druze sheikhs,Firro 1992, p. 286. and the withdrawal of Normand's column to al-Suwayda in exchange for concessions from Sultan.Neep 2012, p. 114. Normand refused to negotiate, and decided to carry out his assignment, which was the retrieval of the pilots and the restoration of order in the Jabal al-Druze.Provence 2005, p. 59. On 22 July, at mid-dawn, Sultan and his forces ambushed Normand's troops. Estimates of Sultan's forces vary from Syrian journalist Munir al-Rayyis's figure of 150 to the French estimate of \\"thousands\\". They consisted of Druze from al-Kafr and local Bedouin horsemen from the Sardiyah and Sulut tribes.Provence 2005, pp. 59‚Äì60. Sultan's forces emerged from their positions in the surrounding hills and a nearby valley, and broke the French column's defensive square formation. In the fighting, they managed to kill most of Normand's soldiers. Historian Phillipp S. Khoury states that over half of Normand's soldiers were killed, while historians Kais Firro and Daniel Neep state that only a few soldiers survived and managed to inform their superiors of the ambush. The battle lasted around thirty minutes. Aftermath Later on 22 July, the same day of the Battle of al-Kafr, Sultan and his forces marched to al-Suwayda and forced the French garrison into the town's citadel, which was subsequently besieged. The Battle of al-Kafr and the siege of al-Suwayda marked the point where both Sultan and the French authorities realized a general uprising had begun, according to Firro. Prior to these events, Sultan's principal goal was the release of the arrested al-Atrash sheikhs from French prison, while the French still considered Sultan's activities as \\"disturbances\\". Sultan's victory at al-Kafr swayed the Druze sheikhs of Jabal al-Druze, including those who cultivated friendly ties with the French Mandatory authorities, to join him. By the end of July, Sultan's forces swelled with thousands of Druze volunteers from throughout the area, transforming his small rebel band into an 8,000- to 10,000-strong force. At that time, Sultan's Druze forces, in alliance with the Muslim Sardiyah and Sulut tribes, were in control of all of Jabal al-Druze and were moving onto the Hauran plain, in a position to attack the al-Masmiyah station of the Hejaz Railway.Provence 2005, p. 60.

He played college football for the UCLA Bruins, ending his career as the school's leader in career receptions. Payton was drafted by the Cleveland Browns in the fifth round of the 2016 NFL Draft. Early life Payton was born in Torrance, California, in Los Angeles County to Kathy and Jerry Payton, who played linebacker at Crenshaw High. Payton played catch as a youngster with older brother Michael, who later played college ball at Oregon State. As an eight-year-old playing Pop Warner football, Payton was a backup lineman when his mother convinced the coach to play him at wide receiver during a game which they were trailing at halftime. On his first play, he caught a deep pass for a touchdown.Michael Payton was also a great football player and was honored by Steve Smith Sr. Payton grew up in Santa Monica, California, but attended high school in Westlake Village at Oaks Christian School. As a sophomore, he had 45 receptions for 1,088 yards for a 24.5-yard average and 18 touchdowns. He also played at defensive back and had 30 tackles and three interceptions. He had two games with 10 or more receptions as a junior, and finished the year with a team-leading 61 receptions for 840 yards and 9 touchdowns. In his senior year, he caught 61 throws for 769 yards and 10 touchdowns. Payton verbally committed to three other colleges before ending up with UCLA. As a junior, he committed to play college ball with USC, but the school was subsequently hit by National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) sanctions, and Coach Pete Carroll left for the National Football League (NFL). A senior in 2012, Payton was then set to play for California, but changed his commitment after Tosh Lupoi, one of the top recruiters in the nation, left the school for Washington. Payton announced on national television on ESPNU that he had decided to go to Washington, but he changed his mind again and settled on UCLA the following day. He took a chance on Bruins coach Jim Mora, who was hired only months earlier, and a program that USC had recently shutout 50‚Äì0. Payton was ranked No. 15 in the nation at wide receiver by both Scout.com and Rivals.com, and No. 29 by ESPNU. College career Payton started 10 games as a sophomore in 2013 and ranked third on the team with 38 receptions and 440 yards. He did not put up extraordinary numbers, matching his freshman touchdown total of one. As a junior in 2014, Jordan broke out in the season opener with eight catches for 98 yards, both career-highs at the time, in a 28‚Äì20 win over Virginia. He emerged as the Bruins' No. 1 receiver, finishing the season with 67 catches, the most by a Bruin since Craig Bragg had 73 in 2003. He also finished with team-highs of 954 receiving yards and seven touchdowns, and earned All-Pac-12 honorable mention. Payton had three 100-yard games, and nine times he finished with at least five receptions. In a 62‚Äì27 win over Arizona State, he made five catches for 151 yards and two touchdowns. Although three-year starting quarterback Brett Hundley was leaving school early for the 2015 NFL draft, Payton opted to return for his senior year in part due to the potential he saw in incoming freshman quarterback Josh Rosen. Prior to the 2015 season, Payton made the preseason watch list for the Fred Biletnikoff Award, given annually to the nation's top receiver. After needing a few games to develop a rapport with Rosen, he tied the single-game school record with 14 receptions, set originally by J. J. Stokes, for 152 yards in a 31‚Äì27 loss to Washington State. The following week, he had seven catches for 105 yards in a 17‚Äì9 win over Utah to pass Bragg (193) as the Bruins career leader in receptions. Payton also became UCLA's first player since Nelson Rosario in 2011 to reach 1,000 yards in a season. The victory kept UCLA in contention to win the conference entering their regular season finale against USC, but the Bruins lost 40‚Äì21 to the Trojans for Payton's lone loss in the crosstown rivalry. He ended the season with 78 catches, the second-highest season total in school history, and again received honorable mention for the all-conference team. He finished his career as the first Bruin with over 200 receptions (201). Professional career Payton in 2017 preseason Payton was drafted by the Cleveland Browns in the fifth round of the 2016 NFL Draft, 154th overall. He was one of four receivers drafted by the team that year. On May 13, he signed a four-year contract worth about $2.58 million, which included a signing bonus of about $244,000.; The Browns were coached by Hue Jackson, who was a former coach of Payton's role model and mentor, former NFL receiver T. J. Houshmandzadeh. Payton's brother Michael and Houshmandzadeh were college teammates at Oregon State. Payton was suspended the final four games of the 2016 season for violating the NFL's policy on performance-enhancing drugs. He finished his rookie season with one reception for three yards.

Building The building was built in the late eighteenth century, probably by the British, but possibly by the Dutch. It was used to house the Nupe market. The open-sided market building was constructed in a 'T' shape, with the upper bars of the T running parallel with the road and providing the entrance. The pitched roof is tiled in red Sinhala Kandyan period clay tiles (peti-ulu) and supported by large white stone pillars. The supporting wooden frame of the roof is elaborate and edged with lavish latticework. The building is high and comprises a by timber portico in the middle of the building with three small wooden spires above the main roof. One wing would have housed the vegetable market, the other wing meat and fish. The stem of the T was mostly likely to have been used for the sale of textiles and household items.

The most striking characteristics of Happy World was the Happy World Stadium, greatly recognised for its massive octagonal shape of about 60 metres in diameter and its Happy World Cabaret where men flocked to mingle with taxi- girls for a price.  Opening ceremony On 6 May 1937, Happy World celebrated its opening with a grand affair, with over 1000 guests drinking over 100 gallons of champagne. Tea was served to the guests in the cabaret as well as to 100 tables set up inside the main entrance gates at the park.

The school was founded by dance hostesses of Happy World Cabaret and funded entirely by their profits.

Happy World was assured to be safe from raids, but it was to be partially converted to a gambling den. The Japanese made use of these gambling dens to earn profits, from taxes and licence fees.

Fall in popularity However, in the 1970s, popularity of Gay World began to decline due to various factors. =Urban redevelopment= In the late 1960s, the Singaporean government became increasingly concerned with issues related to gangsterism and associated them with the nightlife scene in the country. Finally, in 1972, after a stabbing incident at the Boiler Room club in Mandarin Hotel, the government issued a total ban on live music in clubs. The ban lasted for five years. As urban redevelopment plans in Singapore went underway, \\"the character of the Geylang of the numbered lorongs was changing, too. The rich folks who lived in those grand bungalows ‚Ä¶ were slowly shifting out. Sleaze and vice, which for the longest time was discretely tucked away, started to become more prominent.\\" (Mr Joseph Pereira, Geylang resident) Consequently, visitors to Gay World also progressively declined. =Frequent fires= Another factor that caused Gay World's drop in popularity was the frequent fires that ravaged the park. In 1962, fire broke out twice within 2 months. This caused the damage of a theatre, part of the Cabaret and 26 stalls.

Future Green Diamond has stated they are not interested in demolishing the bridge as doing so would be prohibitively expensive and damage the sensitive riparian environment it's built over. They also stated they're not interested in establishing a scenic railroad or any other attraction at the bridge themselves, as they wish to focus solely on their timber business. In 2013, Green Diamond opened up talks with Mason County Parks and a local bungee jumping company about leasing the bridge to the company. The bridge deck would be rehabilitated into a pedestrian crossing with a bungee jumping spot established mid-deck, similar to the Bridge to Nowhere in California. Green Diamond also approached Washington State Parks on opening the bridge to the public as a tourist attraction, but negotiations fells through due to a lack of funding and suitable insurance.

It operated in the eastern United States, and in New England in particular. The brand has been revived in the 21st century as a small internet retailer. Foundation and success Anderson‚ÄìLittle was founded in the Boston area in 1918 or in the 1920s by Morris B. Anderson and Albert Little. Anderson had been born in Russia and came to America as a teen; before co-founding Anderson-Little he had worked for Singer Sewing Machine, and managed firms including the Morris B. Anderson Clothing Company. In the 1930s ‚Äì perhaps 1933, or perhaps 1936 ‚Äì the company relocated to Fall River, Massachusetts, then a textile- manufacturing center. The company opened a retail store in Fall River in 1936, and after World War II they opened their first factory showroom (a store in a factory), becoming a pioneer of factory‚Äìto‚Äìconsumer retailing. These outlets were relatively austere operations with suits being hung on racks made of pipes assembled by company hands. Their main slogan and jingle for decades, \\"The Best Factory Makes the Best Clothing\\", emphasized the manufacturing side of the business. In 1956, the Fall River factory was producing 3000 garments every week and had employed over 1000 people. By 1960 they had eleven stores, all in New England. In 1966 they were acquired by Richman Brothers, at which time there were 40 stores. In 1969 Richman Brothers (including Anderson‚ÄìLittle) was acquired by the retail giant Woolworth. In 1981, the company created three new brands ‚Äì Strathmore, Shefford, and Southport ‚Äì and added business attire for women (they had formerly only offered men's clothing). Reports in contemporary news publications showed that the growth of stores may have been much slower than the figures given by articles that were written decades later. The Daily Boston Globe reported that the firm had 7 stores in 1950 and 9 stores in 1956. Women's Wear Daily reported that the firm had 19 stores in 4 states in 1966 and 22 stores in 1967. During the time of Woolworth's ownership, Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach served as the company's celebrity spokesman. Decline and fall Under Woolworth control Anderson‚ÄìLittle grew to 100 stores and beyond. However, when Woolworth took its swan-dive to extinction it ran Anderson‚ÄìLittle into the ground. By 1992 the company had swollen to 260 stores, three factories, and two distribution centers, but was no longer profitable. That same year Woolworth (just a few years short of its own 1997 demise) closed all but seven Anderson‚ÄìLittle stores and announced it would shut the division down entirely, but a buyer was found and the remnants of Anderson‚ÄìLittle were sold to Cliftex Manufacturing (owners of Gentleman's Wearhouse (not to be confused with Men's Wearhouse)) that same year. Cliftex then rebranded some of their Gentlemen's Wearhouse stores as Anderson‚ÄìLittle stores and also began selling clothing under the Anderson‚ÄìLittle brand in their Gentleman's Wearhouse stores. In 1992, Cliftex operated 26 Anderson‚ÄìLittle stores, but closed 16 of them that year. Cliftex Manufacturing closed the remaining Anderson‚ÄìLittle stores in 1998. Revival Ten years later, in 2008, Stuart Anderson (great-grandson of founder Morris Anderson) and his son Scott Anderson reclaimed the brand, which had become available after Cliftex went bankrupt, and started a new clothing company under that name. This revived company, based in Miami, is a web‚Äìonly retailer, with products made in America. Their first product was a classic blue blazer, and as of 2016 that and a black version remain their sole product. In a planned succession Stuart Anderson retired in 2014 and Anderson-Little is now owned and run by Scott Anderson, the fifth generation of Andersons to run the brand.

It was designed by Queensland Colonial Architect's Office and built in 1897 by William Cristine Horton and Louis Bouttell. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Childers Court House on polling day, 5 February 1908 The Childers Court House is a single story timber building erected in 1897; in 1900 a new court room was added to form a \\"T\\" shaped building. It is one of a number of public buildings (including government and banking) which characterise the northern side of Childers' main street and was the first purpose built court house erected in the newly emerging sugar town. Following logging of the dense Isis Scrub in the 1870s, Childers, in the heart of the scrub, was promoted in the 1880s by Maryborough interests, as an agricultural district. The land in the immediate vicinity of the present town of Childers was surveyed in 1882 into farm blocks. There was no official town survey; Childers developed following the private subdivision of portions 870 and 871, at the railhead of the 1887 Isis railway line from Isis Junction on the North Coast railway line. This was opened on 31 October 1887, and was intended principally to facilitate the transport of timber from the scrub. The coming of the railway not only promoted the development of the town of Childers; it also proved the catalyst for the establishment of a sugar industry in the district in the late 1880s. At the opening of the railway to Childers, Robert Cran, owner of Maryborough's Yengarie mill, announced that he would erect a double crushing juice mill at Doolbi, to supply his mill at Yengarie. This was completed in 1890, with the juice being brought in railway tankers from the Isis. Further expansion of the sugar industry in the Isis was closely related to the activities of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which erected a central crushing mill in the district 1893-94, and began crushing in 1895. By 1895, at least three other mills had been established in the Isis, with another two under construction, and Childers had emerged as the flourishing centre of a substantial sugar-growing district: in the years between 1891 and 1900 the population grew from 91 to 4000. In 1903 the old Isis Divisional Board (1886) was abolished and Isis Shire proclaimed, with the new seat of municipal government moving from Howard to Childers. Prior to the erection of the Court House court sittings were held in the former Land Commissioner's office at the Childers Post Office. In 1896 the Secretary of the Isis Progress Association wrote to the Home Secretary urgently requesting the building of a court house in Childers as larger premises are needed for the amount of court business. According to the Committee there were numberless reasons to justify the building of a court house but the most important of which was to provide an area for people to wait inside rather than out on the street. In March 1897 tenders for the erection of a new court house at Childers were called; the tender of William Cristine Horton and Louis Bouttell for being accepted in August. A drawing stamped 25 January 1897 prepared by the Government Architect's Office shows a single story timber building comprising public waiting area, court room, and an office to the rear surrounded by verandahs on all four sides. Plans for the court room furniture were also included. The Childers Court House is an example of one of a number of court house types developed by the Government Architect for use throughout country Queensland. The use of these types addressed the need for economy but also resulted in a high quality of public building even on this modest scale. By November the building was almost complete with Inspector of Works Hannington advising that it will be necessary, on account of the site having been changed, to construct a dividing fence to separate the Court House ground from that of the Station Master's house and recommending shifting the front line of split paling fence, and erecting a new front fence of sawn battens, and supplying a bridge over water table. The specification included reference to the purpose built furniture for the court room and the building was to be coloured in a light stone tint and picked out in darker shades as directed. Soon after, in 1900, additions were made to accommodate the District Court sittings to be held in Childers (in addition to the Police Court work already held). The Clerk of Petty Sessions reported the need for two additional rooms (one for the Police Magistrate and Judge and another for the Jury to retire to). A third room would be convenient for witnesses waiting to give evidence especially to female witnesses who are sometimes subject to unpleasant insinuations cast at them when waiting about the Court. Plans prepared by the Government Architect show the addition of a wing to the western side of the existing building; with the earlier building to be remodelled to accommodate a jury room, the Police Magistrate and Judge's room, and Crown Prosecution Service office. The new wing was to contain the new court room. The plans provided for high set windows (presumably to facilitate the privacy of the court) and lowset ventilating grills with existing court room furniture to be reused in the new room. Public access was from a verandah at the western end; official access was provided from the 1897 building (housing the court offices). Tenders for the additions were called in May; George Upham's tender of to be completed in three months was accepted. It is the 1900 reconfiguration of the court house which survives today with the 1900 court room still in use as the Magistrate's Court and the 1897 building used for associated administration. Recent works include the insertion of air-conditioning services and the addition of a ramp entry for disabled access (1995). Other changes include the removal of roof ventilators and a decorative white picket fence (shown in a 1908 photo; replaced by a chain wire fence). As with other country court houses across the state, the Childers Court House is more than its name implies. Since Queensland separated from New South Wales in 1859, court houses have been an important symbol of the ongoing settlement of the colony (later the state) as well as in a practical sense a centre for government services. Thus, in addition to its court functions, the Childers Court House (which celebrated its centenary in 1997) is also an administrative centre providing an agency for a number of other state government departments and/or services to the people of the Isis region.  Description  The Childers Court House is located in the centre of Childers at the corner of Churchill Street (the main street) and Crescent Street. It forms part of a government precinct which includes the nearby Post Office and Childers Ambulance Station). The earliest 1897 section of the Childers Court House is rectangular in plan form with its long axis set perpendicular to the street. The 1900 addition is attached to this running to the west which also has a rectangular plan form. The building is a single storeyed and constructed in timber and set on timber stumps and is clad in a combination of weatherboard at the exposed walls and exposed frame in the sheltered areas under the timber verandah. The verandah, which has simple double horizontal rails as the balustrade, surrounds the original section of the building. There is also a verandah on the west end of the addition. There is an access ramp for people with disability attached to the eastern verandah. The roof forms are gabled and clad in corrugated colorbond. The gables are infilled with vertical boarding which has a scalloped bottom edge and supported at the lower end by an exposed collar tie. The apex of the gable is surmounted by a timber finial. French doors open onto the verandah in the original section. The windows in this area are double hung and are constructed as part of the exposed frame system. The windows on the addition, which functions as a Court Room, are narrow and at high level down the north and south elevations. These elevations also exhibit ventilation grill that were a part of the original design. Both sections of the building are now air- conditioned with a split refrigerated system. Both sections of the building are clad internally with tongue and grooved boarding. The ceilings which are in the same material follow the rafter line to the bottom of the collar ties where they become flat. The 1897 building contains offices; the Court Room retains elements of early furniture that include the Judges bench, dock, reporters benches and clerks tables. The interior of the Court Room also displays the trade certificate of the carpenter.  Heritage listing  Childers Court House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Childers Court House is important in illustrating the pattern of Queensland history being erected during a period of unprecedented growth in the Isis, when Childers was emerging as the flourishing centre of a substantial sugar- growing district. Erected in 1897 (with major additions 1900), the Court House has served the Isis community for over a century. In common with other country court houses it is associated not only with the administration of justice but also, from the earliest European settlement, as an administrative centre for a range of government services. The building of such infrastructure was a tangible expression of government's recognition and encouragement of the growth of the Isis; the Court House became one of a number of public buildings which characterise the north side of Childers main street. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Childers Court House (including court room furniture) is a fine and intact example of a timber country court house. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The building, particularly due to its use of scale, form and materials, contributes to the heritage significance of the Churchill Street streetscape and Childers townscape. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Erected in 1897 (major additions 1900), the Court House has served the Isis community for over a century. In common with other country court houses it is associated not only with the administration of justice but also, from the earliest European settlement, as an administrative centre for a range of government services. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. It has a special association with the work of the Government Architect's Office which developed a number of court house types which sought to respond to matters both economic and climatic, as well as providing a high quality of public building even on this modest scale.

He had a brief playing career with Zambia and won several trophies as a defender with Mufulira Wanderers. Early life Lwandamina was born and brought up in Mufulira's Kamuchanga township where his mother supported his love of football by buying him rubber footballs.Tembo, Benedict (16 October 2010). \\"Chicken\\" ‚Äì from utility player to super mentor\\" Zambia Daily Mail,, p. 10 His father died when he was ten years old so he was taken in by his aunt who lived in Kitwe's Wusakile township, where one of the teachers at Wusakile Primary School spotted him playing football and got him a place at the school and he started playing for the school team as a striker. He later moved to Justin Kabwe Primary School but had to stop school in the 5th grade as he had no one to pay his school fees. During this time, he worked on his soccer skills and when he resumed his education, he went straight to the final grade and easily passed the exams to qualify to Ndeke Secondary School. His two year absence from the class room motivated him to complete his schooling and dispel the notion that footballers are dull so he took his studies seriously and stayed away from football. However, the school's Sports Master soon discovered that he had a talented player who preferred not to play for the school so he invited Lwandamina to join the team but gave him a whipping first. Despite only being in the eighth grade, he was named captain ahead of his seniors and he ended up captaining his school team for the entire five years that he was at Ndeke Secondary. Club career Lwandamina earned call-ups to the Copperbelt and Zambia Secondary Schools teams and his leadership qualities were recognized as he later became a prefect at Ndeke Secondary, where his school-mates nicknamed him \\"Chicken\\" after cock fighter Chicken George in Alex Haley's Roots. With his interest in soccer re-ignited, he joined amateur side CISB where he played with Kenneth Malitoli and Kapambwe Mulenga, and would visit his mother in Chingola during the school holidays, where he would feature for Chiwempala Leopards. During his final year in school in 1984, Lwandamina received a lot of offers from clubs within Kitwe but opted to join Mutondo Stars which was being coached by Fordson Kabole. The day after completing school, he went back to Mufulira and rather than join Wanderers, he chose to join their rivals Mufulira Blackpool as he was keen on following Kalusha Bwalya's route to stardom, and he was well received at John Yumba Kachofa Stadium. After a season at Blackpool, Lwandamina fulfilled his dream and moved to Shinde Stadium in 1986 and though Bwalya and Charles Musonda had left to pursue professional careers in Belgium Wanderers still had a formidable team under coach Ackim Musenge with the likes of Ashols Melu, Efford Chabala, Philemon Mulala, Evans Mulala, Emmanuel Munaile and Lackson Manda. When Melu left to join Olympiacos in Greece, Lwandamina took over the captain‚Äôs armband and though Wanderers won a lot of cups, the league title eluded them. During his time at Wanderers, he won the Mosi Cup, the Challenge Cup, the Heroes and Unity trophy and the Champion of Champions Cup. He later suffered a knee injury in 1992 which hampered him for almost three years, as he had to rely on binding the knee and pain-killing injections until he was forced into retirement in 1995. International career In November 1987, Lwandamina was called up to the national team by Samuel \\"Zoom\\" Ndhlovu as Zambia prepared to take part in that year's CECAFA Cup tournament in Ethiopia, though he was left out of the final team.\\"Six called to beef up squad.\\" Times of Zambia, 25 November 1987. He returned to the squad for the following year‚Äôs CECAFA edition in Malawi and made his debut in a match against Ethiopia which ended in a goalless draw and Zambia went all the way to the final only to lose 3-1 to Malawi after extra time. His brief career with the national team ended with a 1990 World Cup qualifier against Morocco in Rabat in January 1989, which Zambia lost 1-0. Managerial career=Mufulira Wanderers Soon after he quit playing, Lwandamina was appointed Assistant Coach to Melu at Wanderers in 1995 and the team won its first league title in 17 years which they retained the following year. After attending a coaching course in Germany, he took over the reins at Wanderers when Melu died in January 1997. Wanderers reached the quarterfinals of the African Club Champions Cup where they lost to Egyptian club Zamalek and relinquished the league title to Power Dynamos though they managed to win the BP Challenge Cup. Green Buffaloes With Wanderers beset by financial problems, Lwandamina left for Nchanga Rangers in 2000 and was in charge of the youth programme but he did not stay there for long as he quit to become Peter Kaumba's assistant at Green Buffaloes in 2001, and when Kaumba left the army club the following year, Lwandamina was elevated to the head coach's position and they finished third in the league. He led Buffaloes to the runners-up slot in 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2007. Kabwe Warriors After a third place finish in 2008, Buffaloes' management decided to part ways with Lwandamina and he moved to Kabwe Warriors in 2009, but he left the following season with club management unhappy that he was spending far too much time at the national team where he was assistant coach. Red Arrows After spending some time as Youth Coordinator at the Olympic Youth Development Centre in Lusaka, Lwandamina took over at Red Arrows and achieved a second place finish in 2011, followed by the Barclays Cup and 4th place in the league in 2013. This was deemed not good enough by the team‚Äôs management despite the cup triumph being their only piece of silverware since their solitary league win in 2004, and Lwandamina‚Äôs contract was terminated. ZESCO United Ndola giants ZESCO United wasted no time in signing Lwandamina in 2014, and he won the league and cup double in his first season, retaining the league the following year. He also won back to back Zambian Coach of the Year awards. National team coaching career Lwandamina, who has attended coaching courses in Germany and the Netherlands, first served as Zambia U-20 national team coach from 2003 to 2008 during which time he won the COSAFA title. In 2007, he guided the team to the semi-finals of the Africa Youth Championship and subsequent qualification to the World Youth Cup in Canada where Zambia reached the round of 16. He first served as assistant national team coach under Kalusha Bwalya in 2005 to 2006, when Patrick Phiri took over. He returned to work under Herv√© Renard, and briefly took over for a friendly against South Africa in January 2009, when Renard refused to accompany the team. When Renard quit the Zambian job the first time in 2010, Lwandamina took over the team as interim coach in an unsuccessful two match reign that ended in failure to qualify to the 2011 tournament. After Honour Janza was fired in May 2015, five days before a 2017 qualifier against Guinea-Bissau, Lwandamina was named Zambian coach and though he started with a disappointing 0-0 draw, he was given a vote of confidence by then FAZ boss Kalusha Bwalya after getting an away win in Kenya and then qualifying Zambia to the 2016 African Nations Championship. At the 2016 African Nations Championship in Rwanda, Zambia topped their group, but fell out at the quarter-final stage after losing to Guinea on penalties. Although the FAZ had intimated that Lwandamina would be given a contract, he continues to operate without one and doubles as ZESCO United coach.

It was designed by Queensland Colonial Architect's Office and built from 1890 to 1910. It is also known as Childers Heritage Shop. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 24 January 2003.  History  Childers Post & Telegraph Office, circa 1930 The Childers Post Office is a timber post office situated on a corner block on the northern side of Childers' main street opposite the Court House. It was built to a standard government design in 1890 and substantially extended by the Queensland Government Architect's Office in 1910, reflecting the growth of Childers and Commonwealth policy to improve the postal facilities of towns associated with agricultural and pastoral expansion. Currently the building operates as a gift shop but continues to provide post office services. Following logging of the dense Isis Scrub in the 1870s, Childers, in the heart of the Scrub, was promoted in the 1880s by Maryborough interests, as an agricultural district. The land in the immediate vicinity of the present town of Childers was surveyed in 1882 into farm blocks. There was no official town survey; Childers developed following the private subdivision at the railhead of the 1887 Isis railway line from Isis Junction. This was opened on 31 October 1887, and was intended principally to facilitate the transport of timber from the scrub. The coming of the railway not only promoted the development of the town of Childers; it also proved the catalyst for the establishment of a sugar industry in the district in the late 1880s. At the opening of the railway to Childers, Robert Cran, owner of Maryborough's Yengarie mill, announced that he would erect a double crushing juice mill at Doolbi, to supply his mill at Yengarie. This was completed in 1890, with the juice being brought in railway tankers from the Isis. Further expansion of the sugar industry in the Isis was closely related to the activities of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which erected a central crushing mill in the district 1893-94, and began crushing in 1895. By 1895, at least three other mills had been established in the Isis, with another two under construction, and Childers had emerged as the flourishing centre of a substantial sugar- growing district. A Post Office first opened in Childers in 1887. In 1890 a purpose built building was constructed and opened on 17 September 1890. It carried on both the post and telegraph office business as well as providing residential accommodation for the post master which was clearly separated from the business part of the building by a picket fence surrounding the front garden. In January 1894, the telegraph office was relocated to the newly opened Childers railway station. The quarters were housed in a standard T11 form and the offices in an adjoining double gabled section on the corner. The T11 post office type was a porch and gable style developed during the 1880s and used outside major towns. The form was developed further during 1900 to 1940 and is typical of many post offices of the period. There are only a few examples left of the 19th century form. Although in 1901 the Commonwealth Post Master General's Department was created, transfer of responsibility from the colonies to new organisations was gradual. The new Commonwealth administration upgraded buildings and facilities in towns associated with agricultural and pastoral expansion. New post offices were built in some towns and others had facilities upgraded. In 1910, major additions were made to the Childers Post Office. The section of the building used as a post office was modified to a form identified by the 1983 National Estate study of post offices as a type T17 with a twin porch, gable and lantern, a form that became one of the most readily identifiable post office styles. It was architecturally important not only for the forms which developed from it in the 1920s and 30s, but for its visual appeal and the quality of construction and detail with which it was carried out. In 1971, a new telephone exchange and trunk line building was erected to take place of the existing manual exchange and provide automatic trunk line switching facilities to surrounding district exchanges. A building to house this was ; building erected on site adjoining the Post Office with access from Crescent Street and there are easements between the two sites. In 1994 the building was sold into private ownership and now operates as the Childers Heritage Shop although some post office services are also continued. In 1999 alterations were carried out to allow the operation of a coffee shop in a former bedroom by opening the verandah on the residence and creating a roof deck section between the verandah and eastern porch of the post office. Paving and landscaping were also carried out to a forecourt area.  Description  The Childers Post Office is located on the corner of Crescent Street and Churchill Street (Childers' main street), opposite the court house. It is a single storey timber building set on low stumps with a corrugated iron roof and comprises two sections: the former residence in an earlier building to the east, and the post office proper. The former residential quarters is situated to the east of the post office and in line with it. There is a projecting bay on the eastern side with a gabled roof and a verandah runs along the front of the residence in line with this. The front wall of a former bedroom opening onto this verandah has been opened onto the verandah to provide for a coffee shop. The post office section is on the corner and is accessed by one of two porches sitting to either side of a projecting gable and reached by timber stairs with timber balustrading. The eastern porch is now linked to the residence by a deck. The windows are shaded by sun hoods on timber brackets.  Heritage listing  The Childers Post Office was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 24 January 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Post Office is important in illustrating the pattern of Queensland history, being a government facility erected during a period of unprecedented growth in the Isis, when Childers was emerging as the centre of a substantial sugar-growing district. It was substantially extended during the period before the First World War when the new Commonwealth government made a policy of upgrading postal services to developing agricultural and pastoral communities. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The earliest section has been identified by a post office study as being one of the few of its type remaining. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The post office building includes examples of two standard post office types developed by the Government Architect's Office during a period when a high quality of design and finish was achieved. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The post office, in its scale, form and materials, makes a major contribution to townscape of Childers.

Current Opinion in Neurobiology 29 (2014): 82-87. Retrieved 18 November 2015. Linster's recent research has shown that neuromodulators such as acetylcholine and norepinephrine, the two main neuromodulators for olfactory sensory processing in the adult main olfactory bulb (OB), aid in discrimination between chemically similar odorants in cannulated rats. The rats showed a reduction in spontaneous discrimination between similar odors when nicotinic acetylcholine receptors were blocked, and they showed a significant enhancement in spontaneous discrimination when the efficacy of cholinergic inputs was increased by unblocking these receptors. However, when the rats were observed during reward-motivated odor-discrimination tasks, the difference in cholinergic uptake by nicotinic receptors produced no significant behavioral changes. Linster's findings show that the OB is a highly plastic structure that is directly modulated by olfactory experience and the perception of odors. This plasticity of the OB in turn leads to behavioral changes based on how an odor is processed and paired with reward associations. Linster took these studies further by examining how neural mechanisms such as these play a role in habituation and olfactory memory based on different periods of exposure to odors.McNamara, Ann Marie, et al. \\"Distinct neural mechanisms mediate olfactory memory formation at different timescales\\".

It was released in Japan in January 2017, and worldwide in June 2017. It is a spin-off of the Valkyria Chronicles series, set in a different fictional universe. The game received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the game's setting and concept as engaging but criticized the story delivery and large amount of loading screens, calling the gameplay and graphical quality lackluster.  Gameplay  Valkyria Revolution is an action role- playing game with strategy elements. The flow of the game consists of the player preparing at their base, going to the battlefield to achieve their objectives, and then returning to the base again. The game includes the possibility of permanent death for the characters, but players are able to retry if one of them dies. The turn-based action found in the Valkyria Chronicles series was replaced with a more active combat system where actions and decisions on the battlefield have to be made in real time. The player leads a squad of up to 4 allies with different roles including damage-dealing shocktroopers, fleet-footed scouts, shield-bearers with heavy defense, and \\"sappers\\" who focus on alchemy and long-range attacks. Though the player can only control one character at a time, the artificial intelligence behavior of their allies can be influenced by chosen \\"Priorities\\" that can be set before battle. Priorities range from basic commands like using melee attacks, to more specific commands like guarding allies at low health. More Priorities can be acquired by visiting a \\"Circle\\" in town between missions and listening to their conversation. Furthermore, players can order their squad to focus on offense, defense, or support functions, and can break up their squad into \\"solo\\" or \\"partner\\" units to take on multiple enemies, or stay as a squad to focus on one enemy. Each character carries a melee weapon, long-range weapon, a grenade, and an item pouch for single-use restorative items. The long-range weapon and grenades have limited ammo, which can only be replenished by capturing enemy bases in the field. Each character also has the ability to cast magic spells called \\"alchemy,\\" with varying affects depending on the type of alchemy equipped. Most weapons and alchemy can be upgraded and switched out among every character between battles at Basil's Workshop in town, but melee weapons are permanently attached to the specific characters wielding them. Melee weapons can be upgraded at Basil's shop to expand the user's stats and alchemic affinities, but extra alchemy must be used to upgrade them instead of money.  Plot  The story of Valkyria Revolution is told in medias res as a Jutland student working on a paper about \\"The Five Traitors\\" seeks to learn more about their history and the war between Jutland and the Ruzi Empire. His teacher, Richelle, frequently interrupts the game to elaborate on certain points within the story as told to her by her great-great-grandmother, who was a teacher to the Jutish princess at the time. The small country of Jutland was economically blockaded by Ruzhien, a powerful empire that expanded its territory and achieved rapid industrial development after discovering the azure mineral Ragnite, which serves both as an energy source and a catalyst for alchemic development. Ten years prior to the war, in the land of Molda, an orphanage was burned down by the Ruzi Emperor Klaudiusz and his four Grand Generals as they were visiting nearby Valkyria ruins. The men also kidnapped Maria, the caretaker at the orphanage. Only five orphans survived, having been away from the orphanage at the time: Amleth Gr√∏nkj√¶r, Basil Sabancci, Fritte Eriksen, Solomon Kahlenberg and Violette Szand. The five secretly plotted to kill Klaudiusz and attempt to find Maria. As they were adopted by foster parents, the five grew incredibly skilled in their respective fields: Amleth became an officer in the Jutland army, and would later form then anti-Valkyrie unit named Vanargand. Basil became an industrialist who owned a factory that dealt in ragnite-based weapons and technology. Fritte chose to become a writer, using his words to inspire the people of Jutland and later provoke them into war. Solomon became a legislator who helped provide legal cover for the group's actions while steering the country towards war. Violette became a master spy, using her skills and charm to form a large network of contacts throughout Europa. An initial attempt to kill Klaudiusz failed, as Amleth's strike was blocked by the appearance of a Reaper-like figure and nearly killed, but for some reason the Reaper spared his life and fled. Following the event, the five discussed their next move, as Klaudiusz would no longer be so vulnerable while the Ruzi Empire and its allies blockaded Jutland to the breaking point. After a coin toss, the five decided to set Jutland on a course for war, both to end the blockade and to get revenge for Maria. With Basil's help, Amleth formed Vanargand within the Jutish army, knowing that any attack on Klaudiusz would be pointless if they could not defeat the Valkyria-esque Reaper guarding him. Joining Amleth and his newly-formed unit were the Jutish Princess Ophelia and her protective knight, Godot. Despite Amleth's objections, Ophelia decides to join Vanargand on the front lines in Molda and gets her first taste of battle by stabbing a Ruzi soldier with her rapier. Amleth chased down the fleeing Grand General, Balthus Greppenberg, after the unit destroyed his Dragon mech. When the General refused to answer any more questions about Maria, Amleth killed him while Ophelia and Godot watched nearby. Though the country rejoiced at an easing of the blockade, Ophelia and Godot began digging into Amleth's background, while the Five continued provoking the country further into war against the Empire. The next battlefront was the kingdom of Ipseria, where Amleth, Ophelia and Godot ran into a powerful attacker with a magically-enhanced prosthetic arm bearing a resemblance to Maxim Laertes, the estranged Prince of Ipseria. However, Maxim escaped before they could find out why he allied himself with the Empire. The Jutish Army continued marching north to \\"liberate\\" more countries from the Empire, while Amleth hoped to find a second Grand General, Gustav Mecklenburg. While the army secured an industrial town, Amleth found Gustav nearby, but the Jutish contingent in the city collapsed after the appearance of the Reaper from before, singing a mysterious song. Ophelia was surprised to find that she was unaffected, and that her own song could cancel out the Reaper's magic. Even with their combined efforts, the Vanargand unit just barely fought off the Reaper, but ended up ripping off her outfit to reveal a Valkyria woman wearing a pendant that bore a strong resemblance to Maria. Though Jutland claimed victory in the battle, Amleth's behavior led to increased suspicion both from Godot and others within Vanargand. In-between missions, Godot tracked down the Five Traitors but decided to keep their identities secret, thinking that their actions supported Jutland, regardless of their motives. Several battles later, Vanargand assisted the Jutland Army with a push at Kovaltis, only to find themselves facing the Valkyria again. After another drawn out battle, Amleth stayed his hand, hearing Maria's voice from the Valkyria. Just as the Valkyria was about to strike Amleth, Godot threw himself in front of her scythe, sacrificing his life. Back home, Godot's younger sister Miranda picked up his sword and shield and took his role as Vanargand's Executive Officer, but she later found a journal among Godot's belongings that led her to the identities of the Five Traitors. It's later revealed that the empire kidnapped Miss Maria to become the vessel for the Valkyria Brunhilde. Later, the rest of the squad finds out about Amleth's true motivations and the rest of the Traitors and they initially distrust him, but thanks to Ophelia, The Traitors and Anti-Valkyria squad work together to defeat the rest of the Ruzhien empire. Amleth also overcomes his doubts and finally kills Brunhilde and at the same time, Miss Maria peacefully dies in his arms. Klaudiusz commits suicide before the squad can reach him and the Empire collapses with his death. Afterwards, the Traitors take responsibility for the war and all five are sentenced to death. However, a secret ending implies that the squad helps the traitors escape.  Development  The game was developed by Media.Vision, and is directed by Takeshi Ozawa and produced by Youichi Shimosato and Kei Mikami. The characters are designed by Hiro Kiyohara and Takayama Toshiaki, and modeled by Flight Unit. The game uses the Gouache Drawing Engine for the graphics, with which the development team intends to depict the game in a painting-like manner. Work on the game began with the development team wanting to create something new related to the Valkyria series; at first, they considered making a real-time strategy game, but decided to make a real-time role-playing game instead, as they thought more people would want to play that. Ozawa said that while there are aspects of the game that are similar to Valkyria Chronicles, the game is mostly different. Shimosato saw it as a new series within the Valkyria franchise; he referred to it as the Kakumei (\\"Revolution\\") series, and called previous Valkyria games the Senjou (\\"Battlefield\\") series. alt=A photo of Yasunori Mitsuda The game's original score was composed, arranged, and produced by Yasunori Mitsuda, which was his first solo game soundtrack in over seven years. Intending to express the game's worldview through the music, he chose to use a classical sound for the game, and used seamless switching between battle and field music, something that was new to him. The main theme was performed by the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra; according to Mitsuda, the scale of the recording session was larger than what was usual for Japanese video games. A few songs were sung by Sarah √Älainn, who Mitsuda had also worked with previously on the ending track of Xenoblade Chronicles. According to her and Mitsuda, it was a positive song themed around death. Because of its similarity to hymns, √Älainn attempted to express the song with a \\"mystic yet dark feeling to the singing\\". One of the game's themes is death; the development team felt that if characters would not die, the player would not feel fear, which is what led to the inclusion of permanent death in the game. They included story events for specific characters, to make the player feel motivated to keep everyone alive; while the main story continues, events relating to specific characters do not occur if that character is dead. However, they intended for it to be possible to experience everything in the game if the player puts effort into it, with it being possible to retry if a character dies. The development team did not want to tone down the obstacles the player faces in the game; instead, they plan to include an easier mode. A demo for the game was included with the PlayStation 4 release of Valkyria Chronicles; Sega gathered feedback on the game from people who play the demo. This was a change compared to previous games by the developer, where the demo was released close to the release of the final product, making it have no effect on the development. They received around three times the amount of feedback they had expected; according to Kozawa, a lot of it was \\"harsh\\". This led them to change the game's battle system, to make it feel more like a role-playing game and less like an action game: in the demo, the action focus made it difficult to strategize during battles, so the developers added an action gauge to allied and enemy characters, with actions being possible to perform when the gauge is filled up; they also added the option for players to stop time while using weapons or abilities. Among other changes in response to the feedback were an increased number of party members and the removal of field encounters. Kozawa also said that he was thinking of a way for the player to customize the artificial intelligence of their allies, and that they were working on a way to make direct commands.  Promotion and release  Valkyria Revolution booth at Tokyo Game Show 2016 The game was announced for PlayStation 4 in November 2015 alongside a PlayStation 4 version of Valkyria Chronicles. In August 2016, a PlayStation Vita version was also revealed. The game was released in Japan on January 19, 2017, and in North America and Europe in June 2017. For the Western releases, an Xbox One version was also released. The home console versions were made available both physically and digitally in the West, while the PlayStation Vita version was a digital-only title. A two-disc, official soundtrack was released alongside the game's Japanese release on January 19. In the Americas, pre-orders and limited launch copies of the physical PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions came packaged as the ‚ÄúVanargand Edition,‚Äù named after the in-game specialized unit of anti-Valkyria soldiers. It includes a metal pin emblazoned with the elite team‚Äôs insignia, a 12-track soundtrack by Mitsuda, and a special outer box. According to Sega, the reason they changed the title from the Japanese original was that a direct translation of Aoki Kakumei no Varukyuria (\\"Valkyria of the Blue Revolution\\") seemed \\"unwieldy\\" and difficult to handle graphically, while the punctuation in Valkyria: Azure Revolution also was a hindrance. Because of this, they decided to use a two-word title, similar to Valkyria Chronicles, but different enough that the two games would stand \\"equal but apart from each other\\". Four downloadable content (DLC) packs were released for free following the game's launch. Reception Valkyria Revolution received \\"mixed\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Chris Carter of Destructoid rated the game 5/10, criticizing the high amount of cutscenes and \\"shoved in\\" strategic elements as damaging the game's sense of action in its battles, and said it would have \\"turned out better\\" if the team \\"stuck to their guns and made it a full action romp\\". Janine Hawkins of Polygon rated the game 4.5/10 and said that \\"a lot of what made its predecessors so endearing is absent\\", and the game lacked \\"character interaction and meaningful storytelling\\". Calling the gameplay \\"repetitive\\", she stated that the strategic aspects \\"just get in the way\\" of the action, while the combat \\"feels terrible\\". While calling the presentation of story segments \\"gorgeous\\", she stated that they interrupted the game too often, and that the framing and animation of the cutscenes was \\"subpar\\", with the story being \\"shallow\\".

In most of his films, his role as a supporting actor gave him huge appreciation from critics and audience. Personal life Tarun Kumar was born on 24 February 1931 in Kolkata. He was the youngest brother of actor Uttam Kumar. Tarun Kumar passed Matriculation from South Suburban School. Although he joined Ashutosh College, but he could not continue his studies. In his professional life, he used to work in Maclyod Company, Metro Cinema and then at Burn Company for few days. In 1962, he married fellow actress Subrata Devi and had a daughter. Tarun Kumar was also known by his nick name 'Buro' among film industry people. His grandson Sourav Banerjee is also an actor.  Career  Kumar acted in over 500 films since making his debut with Hrod in 1954. In Jhinder Bandi, he played the rival, Udit, the brother of Shankar played by Uttam Kumar. In Se Chupi Chupi Aase and Sonar Harin, he played the antagonist. However, in most Uttam Kumar starred films, he either played the role of a friend in Saptapadi, Chhadmabesi, Jeeban Mrityu, Deya Neya to name a few or that of an associate or well-wisher in films like Raja Saja, Dhanyi Meye, Mon Niye, Sanyasi Raja, Kayahiner Kahini and Brajabuli. Tarun Kumar's acting skill may well be underrated by the tall shadow of his elder brother, Uttam Kumar but probably he was one of the finest character actors ever worked in Bengali film industry, who performed with equal ease in all types of roles irrespective of comic (e.g. Haat Baralei Bandhu, Basanta Bilaap, Mouchak and Personal Assistant), negative (e.g. Joradighir Choudhuri Paribaar, Dui Purush and Kalankita Nayak) and intense (e.g. Sonar Khancha and Stree etc.) characters, including cameo (e.g. Sesh Anka and Rajkanya). He received the President's award for his performance in the film Dadathakur in 1966. Apart from films he acted on quite a few professional theatres. His play Nahabat, in which he had one of the main roles, ran for about seven years.https://www.telegraphindia.com/1031028/asp/bengal/story_2507835.asp Other Works He was chiefly instrumental to establish the Uttam Mancha, an auditorium in South Kolkata, named after his elder brother, the iconic Uttam Kumar whom he loved and adored.

Family life Helm was born in Suurbraak, Cape Colony on 28 September 1844, the son of Daniel Helm, the missionary there. His maternal grandfather was William Anderson. He trained as a missionary at New College, London where he met Baroness Elizabeth von Puttkamer whom he married in 1873. Career He became a missionary with the London Missionary Society. He then returned briefly to Suurbraak, running the mission there following his father's death. However, in 1875 he established a mission at Hope Fountain near Lobengula's capital Bulawayo. Helm had studied Ndebele language and culture, and subsequently gained the confidence of Lobengula. Rudd Concession In October 1888 Rhodes sent three agents, Charles Rudd, James Rochfort Maguire and Francis Thompson, to Matabeleland. According to historians such as Dickson A. Mungazi, Helm was in the pay of Rhodes and deliberately misled the king regarding the contents of the agreement he signed. John Lockhart and Christopher Woodhouse asserted in their 1963 biography of Rhodes that Helm had \\"become one of Rhodes's men\\"‚ÄîStanlake J. W. T. Samkange cites this biography in his 1968 book Origins of Rhodesia to support the statement that Helm was \\"a mere mercenary, a paid hack of Rhodes\\". John Semple Galbraith, in 1974, asserts that \\"there is no evidence that Rhodes 'bought' Helm, only that he tried\\", but that in any case Helm firmly favoured the Rhodes proposal as he thought it might lead to Matabeleland becoming more receptive towards Christianity. Rhodesian Ridgeback Helm is credited with bringing two rough coated and grey-black bitches from Kimberley, South Africa, which were then bred to finally produce the Rhodesian Ridgeback breed of dog. He died on 14 September 1915 in Bulawayo.

They are known for taking their inspiration from mostly literary and academic sources and intense live performances. Terzij de Horde is (poetic) Dutch for ‚Äúset apart from the horde‚Äù. It is a line from the poem ‚ÄúEinde‚Äù (ending) by legendary Dutch poet Hendrik Marsman. Marsman is an inspiration to the band, as are many other authors and philosophers in the same dark, vitalistic vein. History Starting out as Liar Liar Cross On Fire in 2007, the band grew away from its sonic roots in grindcore and crusty hardcore, and toward more dark atmospherics. Throughout their existence, the band has been described as a mix between Khanate, Wolves in the Throne Room, Deathspell Omega and Neil Perry. In April 2010, Terzij de Horde played their first show under that name with Altar of Plagues, Year of No Light and Starve to release their EP ‚ÄúA Rage of Rapture Against the Dying of the Light‚Äù. Since then, the band has received widespread international attention and many very positive reviews both of their recorded music and of their explosive live performances. In June 2011, the EP was rereleased on vinyl by Antithetic Records (Kayo Dot, Maudlin Of The Well, Young & In The Way). In 2011, Terzij de Horde released a split 12‚Äù with fellow countrymen Starve entitled and themed ‚ÄúA Chosen Hollow‚Äù, on which Lurker said: ‚Äú‚Ä¶. Relying less on dissonance and more on moving atmospherics than their debut ever suggested, this is a startling leap forward for a band already ahead of the game. The welding of slow-burning doom and cacophonic black metal returns here, but the hardcore punk assault has been toned down as the band edges closer to their musical ideals. As Alex put it: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing more awe- inspiring in life than witnessing a band growing into its own beastly element of relentless, cathartic rage.‚Äù 2015 saw Terzij de Horde return with their first full-length ¬¥Self¬¥. The album focuses on the problem of self, with each track exploring different ways to live or fail to live with self and world, and the struggles these paths and strategies create: the blindness, suffering, desire for release, for the destruction of self and others, and the turning toward or away from life. Self as prison, self as a source of power, self as vessel for manipulation by outside forces, self as shield and as inner world, self as medium for Dionysian rapture, self as something to be overcome. In the six songs that constitute Self, the rage of black metal is paired with a cathartic destruction as well as a contemplative, sometimes crawling melancholy. Instead of navel gazing or the worship of constructs, Self is analysis forced. A cerebral celebration of liberation at all costs and a requiem for spheres rendered apart. Throughout the years, Terzij de Horde played all over the Netherlands, toured the UK, Ireland and Germany, shared the stage with the likes of Liturgy, Dragged into Sunlight, Laster, Gnaw Their Tongues, Anaal Nathrakh, Bone Awl, Envy and God Dethroned and played festivals like Roadburn, Le Guess Who?, Eurosonic Noorderslag, Siege Of Limerick, Incubate Festival, Ieper Hardcore Fest, Doom Over Leipzig, Into Darkness, Black Metal Desecration and State-X New Forms. Under the name of Footprints in the Void, the band provided a live platform for doom, black, sludge, noise and drone acts in their home city of Utrecht. Bands involved were, among others, Thou, Aderlating, Alkerdeel, Celeste, Moloch, Conan, Dragged Into Sunlight and Aluk Todolo. Members of Terzij de Horde partake in the Maalstroom collaboration of the 2019 edition of Roadburn Festival.

Description Northern slopes of Bogd Khan Mountain viewed from Ulan-Bator Satellite image of Bogd Khan Mountain (centre) with Ulan-Bator at top left Bogd Khan has a total area of and is located between 47¬∞43' to 47¬∞54'N and 106¬∞46' to 107¬∞10'E. Its altitudinal range is between above sea level. It consists of a core area of about surrounded by a buffer zone and certain transition areas. The northern slopes of Bogd Khan Mountain are covered with dense coniferous forests while the southern side is bare rock. History Environmental protection on Bogd Khan Mountain dates back at least to the thirteenth century when the Tooril Khan ruler of the Keraites, forbade logging and hunting there, claiming that Bogd Khan was a holy mountain. Since then, the mountain has been venerated, and local people neither hunted on the mountain nor harvested the timber. In 1778 the Mongolian governor of what is now Ulan-Bator, petitioned the Qianlong Emperor requesting approval to hold twice yearly ceremonies dedicated to Mount Bogd Khan Uul. Permission was granted eight days later for ceremonies to be held twice annually. In 1783, the local government of the Qing dynasty declared the Bogd Khan a protected site, to be preserved for its beauty, making it the oldest national park in the world. Bogd Khan Uul was declared a biosphere reserve by UNESCO in 1996. A biosphere reserve aims to \\"develop and implement sustainable development approaches\\" and encourage \\"ecological and cultural diversity\\", by integrating the needs of local communities with the preservation of the environment. The core area is strictly protected, the buffer zone is used for activities that are compatible with good ecological practices and the transition zone allows ecologically sustainable activities to take place.

It was filmed in October 2015, and debuted on the Hallmark Channel on December 19, 2015. The film was viewed by 3.95 million people upon its debut. Plot Widowed mother Kristin (Lacey Chabert) has recently moved back to her home town of Silver Falls, Ohio with her daughter Emily (Fina Strazza) after her fashion business in Los Angeles folded. The process has been difficult for both of them, especially as the move brings Kristin face to face with Melissa (Mariah Carey), her former rival from high school and the current president of the local PTA. The two women are instantly at odds with one another, making it necessary for their loved ones to show them the Christmas spirit and help them to overcome their differences. Cast * Mariah Carey as Melissa * Lacey Chabert as Kristin * Brennan Elliott as Danny * Fina Strazza as Emily * Kathy Najimy as Sarah Credits adapted from Hallmark Channel's official website. Production In September 2015, the Greater Cincinnati & Northern Kentucky Film Commission stated that Carey would be filming in Cincinnati for an upcoming film, Mistletoe & Melody. Carey was confirmed to be serving as the film's director and as one of the film's stars, and Stella Bulochnikov, Jonathan Axelrod, Alan Ett, Eric Jarboe and Kevin Connor were named as the movie's executive producers. Lacey Chabert and Brennan Elliott were also later confirmed as actors for the film, which had been re-titled A Christmas Melody. Child actress Fina Strazza was brought on to play Chabert's daughter and to sing \\"Oh Santa!\\", which Carey re-wrote for the film. Filming began on October 6, 2015 in the Cincinnati area suburbs of Wyoming and Hyde Park it was expected to wrap on October 16, but did not finish until October 26. On November 17, 2015, the Hallmark Channel released a trailer for A Christmas Melody. Entertainment Tonight poked fun at the trailer, writing \\"Only time will tell how much holiday cheer can be stuffed into one movie, but if this trailer is any indication, A Christmas Melody will be pushing the boundaries.\\" Release and reception A Christmas Melody first aired on the Hallmark Channel on December 19, 2015, as part of the annual \\"Countdown to Christmas\\" holiday programming. It was seen by 3.95 million viewers upon release, more than any other show that day. VH1 wrote a mixed review for the film, stating \\"Sure, the film has an abrupt, saccharine ending, but that doesn't make the journey to it any less fun to watch. In terms of Mariah Carey shade, A Christmas Melody is Oscar-worthy. It's just the so-bad-it's-good trainwreck slosh you need to liven up your It's a Wonderful Life coma.\\" The New York Times was also mixed in their opinion, writing \\"In telling the story of Kristen (Lacey Chabert), a widowed single mom whose Los Angeles fashion boutique goes bust, the movie is as blandly watchable as everything else in Hallmark's Christmas lineup, which includes titles like I'm Not Ready for Christmas, Merry Matrimony and 'Tis the Season for Love. But Ms. Carey's participation makes the generic badness of A Christmas Melody a touch better than its neighbors. She treats herself like a woman who's come to family entertainment from Venus.\\" NPR praised the film as a \\"delightfully bonkers addition to the firmament of holiday madness\\".

Jonathan Currinn, writing in his own website, said that the singer \\"appeal[ed] to people around the world\\" by including Arabic language in \\"Yalla\\", while portal Hitfire commended the \\"strong\\" strophes of the song, Inna's vocals and the beat.

The music video was uploaded onto Inna's official YouTube channel on 12 November 2015, with a teaser of it released few days prior. The clip features a dromedary, the second animal to appear in one of Inna's music videos after \\"Diggy Down\\" previously featured a snake.

Scenes interspersed through the main plot portray Inna singing in front of a door, and her in a desert with a dromedary and dancing around a fire with her backup dancers. Regarding the singer's appearance in the music video, Yohann Ruelle of Pure Charts wrote, \\"Inna knows how to turn on the temperature!\\" Valentina Malfroy from website Aficia commended the quality of the visual and saw Inna as charming.

Just before departing to Dakar in 1971, he met his future wife Genevieve Jeanne Massip in New York, the daughter a Colonel Marcel Massip and niece of French journalist Roger Massip and French writer and 1963 Prix Interalli√© winner Ren√©e Massip.

Robert Duncan was deposed for abandoning communion with the Episcopal Church as part of the Anglican realignment of disaffected theological conservatives in 2008. Early life and ministry McConnell was born into a military family and moved around often as a child. His father was U.S. Air Force General John Paul McConnell. Dorsey McConnell earned his bachelor's degree from Yale College and received a Fulbright scholarship for study in Paris. He then worked several jobs including being an actor and polo groom before marrying and enrolling at General Theological Seminary for his master of divinity. McConnell was ordained a priest in 1983. He went on to become curate of St. Thomas, Fifth Avenue, Chaplain for the Episcopal Church at Yale, Rector of Church of the Epiphany, New York, and Rector of St. Alban's Church in Edmonds, Washington. In 2004, he was called to the rectorship of Church of the Redeemer, Chestnut Hill, in the Diocese of Massachusetts where he served until his election as Bishop of Pittsburgh. Election as bishop McConnell was elected eighth and current bishop diocesan at a special convention held at Trinity Cathedral, downtown, on April 21, 2012. He became bishop-elect after receiving a majority of votes in both orders on the sixth ballot. He received 76% of clergy votes and 57% of lay votes. In addition to McConnell, the original slate of candidates included: the Rev. Michael N. Ambler, Jr., rector of Grace Church, Bath, Maine; the Rev. R. Stanley Runnels, rector of St. Paul's Church, Kansas City, Missouri; and the Rev. Ruth Woodliff-Stanley, rector of St. Thomas Church, Denver, Colorado. A local priest, the Rev. Scott T. Quinn, rector of Church of the Nativity, Crafton, Pennsylvania, was added to the final slate by petition. The election was significant as part of rebuilding the Episcopal diocese after the departure of many theological conservatives. Prior to his election, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported McConnell had a record of advocating for theologically conservative concerns within liberal dioceses while still remaining loyal to the Episcopal Church. He also had experience working alongside both theological liberals and conservatives and churchmanship ranging between High Church Anglo-Catholics and Low Church practices. After receiving the required consents from bishops of jurisdiction and standing committees of other dioceses in the Episcopal Church, McConnell was consecrated bishop on October 20, 2012, by the Most Rev. Katharine Jefferts Schori, twenty-sixth Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church, at Calvary Church, East Liberty. Diocesan leadership McConnell's work has focused on bridge-building in the \\"City of Bridges.\\" During his consecration, he declared being given a vision to build a new bridge for Pittsburgh, a \\"Bridge of the Angels.\\" His unexpected acting from the pews garnered laughter and applause from the congregation of 1,000. On one of the most divisive issues in the diocese, gay marriage, McConnell sought middle ground by allowing local options for parishes and priests to determine whether to perform same-sex marriages. In an August 2014 pastoral letter, Bishop McConnell wrote: \\"I know and treasure the theological diversity of this diocese, and know that practice in this matter will vary from parish to parish‚Ä¶ I support the need for our clergy to be faithful to their own consciences, in choosing to use or not use the Rite, and hope as always that we will continue to regard one another with affection and respect across our differences ...\\" Simultaneously, McConnell expressed theological reservations about the lack of a Biblical warrant for same-sex marriage rites. In addition to establishing a traditional Anglican via media for the most divisive issue in the diocese, McConnell returned diocesan offices to their historical headquarters at Trinity Cathedral, downtown in June 2015. During the tumultuous years of Anglican realignment and related property lawsuits, diocesan offices were relocated to various office buildings in the region. Since 2007, McConnell has helped direct Pilgrim Africa annually. The public health and education organization strives to eliminate malaria, war, and famine in Uganda. The bishop reflects on the experience at his blog, Iron City Bishop. During July 2016, Bishop McConnell's work with Pilgrim Africa focused on the village of Olwa. Seminary affiliations In 2016, McConnell became increasingly active at Presbyterian-affiliated Pittsburgh Theological Seminary (PTS). He was named a member of the board of directors and was a presenter during inaugural festivities of school president David Esterline. In October 2016, the Rev. Canon Dr. Cathy Brall, then canon missioner for the Diocese of Pittsburgh and former provost of Trinity Cathedral, was named PTS's director of field education. Bishop McConnell has been guest preacher at Episcopal Church seminaries. In December 2012, he delivered a sermon in the Chapel of the Good Shepherd at his alma mater General Theological Seminary in New York City. He received an honorary doctorate from General Theological Seminary during its May 2013 commencement. McConnell also preached during chapel at Trinity School for Ministry in September 2013. The conservative-leaning, evangelical school has not named McConnell to its board of trustees nor its board of visitors despite being the only Episcopal-affiliated seminary in the Diocese of Pittsburgh.

After President Gerald Ford signed this legislation into law, citizens living abroad were permitted to cast an absentee ballot in their state of residence. Shortly after ratification, former Republican National Committee Chairman, Bill Brock, and former chairman of UK Republicans, Richard Beeman, established Republicans Abroad in 1978 to organize the estimated 3 million American overseas constituents, the majority of which were Republican. Republicans Abroad hosted a weekly radio-show via wsRadio titled Republicans Abroad Radio. The show aired live weekly for several years.

In January 2013, Republicans Abroad International closed, leaving its chapters to continue forward as independent organizations.

Muste, Jane Addams and Bishop Paul Jones, and claims to be the \\"largest, oldest interfaith peace and justice organization in the United States.\\" Norman Thomas, at first skeptical of its program, joined in 1916 and would become the group's president. Its programs and projects involve domestic as well as international issues, and generally emphasize nonviolent alternatives to conflict and the rights of conscience. Unlike the U.K. movements, it is an interfaith body, though its historic roots are in Christianity.  History = Origins in World War I and activities through the 1940s  FOR in the USA was formed initially in opposition to the entry of the United States into World War I. The American Civil Liberties Union developed out of FOR's conscientious objectors program and the Emergency Committee for Civil Liberties. In 1918, FOR and the American Federation of Labor formed Brookwood Labor College, which lasted until 1937. Also in January 1918, FOR began publication of The World Tomorrow, with Norman Thomas as its first editor. National Secretary Paul Jones wrote in 1921 that the Fellowship of Reconciliation was established as one vehicle to aid in the application of Christian principles to \\"every problem of life.\\"Paul Jones, \\"The Fellowship of Reconciliation,\\" The World Tomorrow [New York], vol. 4, no. 10 (Oct. 1921), p. 317. In addition to the impossibility of harmonizing war with \\"the way of Christ,\\" Jones stated that members of the organization had come to believe in the parallel necessity of a \\"reorganization of Society as will establish it on a Christian basis, so that no individual may be exploited for the profit or pleasure of another.\\" Rather than the FOR itself serving as the primary fulcrum for this activity, \\"in general the members of the Fellowship endeavor to work out their aims through existing organizations and discussion,\\" Jones noted. John Nevin Sayre was active in FOR between 1924 and 1967, and was its chairman from 1935 to 1940. From 1935 onwards, the US branch of FOR published a magazine, Fellowship. Fellowship's contributors included Mohandas Gandhi, Vera Brittain, Norman Thomas, Oswald Garrison Villard, E. Stanley Jones, Walter P. Reuther and Muriel Lester.Advertisement for \\"Fellowship\\", in politics magazine, March 1947 (p. 46). In 1947, FOR and the Congress of Racial Equality, or CORE, which had been founded by FOR staffers James Farmer and George Houser along with Bernice Fisher, sponsored the Journey of Reconciliation, the first Freedom Ride against southern segregation in the wake of the Supreme Court's 1946 Irene Morgan decision.  Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s and fighting poverty in the 1960s  In 1954, China was facing famine and the United States was enjoying surplus harvests, so the FOR organized the Surplus Food for China campaign to convince the government to send food to the Chinese. In 1955 and 1956, Glenn E. Smiley, a white Methodist minister, was assigned by the FOR to assist the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in the Montgomery bus boycott. The two, sitting behind the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, were seatmates on the first interracial bus ride in Montgomery.

In the 1960s, FOR launched \\"Shelters for the Shelterless\\" and built real shelters for homeless people, in response to increasing public demand for fallout shelters. FOR members such as Hassler made contact with the Vietnamese Buddhist pacifist movement and sponsored a world tour by Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh.Mary Hershberger, Traveling to Vietnam: American Peace Activists and the War. Syracuse University Press, 1998 , (pp. 21, 157)  From the arms race in the 1970s to gun control in the 1990s  In the 1970s, FOR founded Dai Dong, a transnational project linking war, environmental problems, poverty and other social issues, involving thousands of scientists around the world. They sought to reverse the Cold War and the arms race with campaigns, marches, educational projects and civil disobedience, and opposed the death penalty in a concerted campaign with ACLU. Beginning in 1975, FOR supported Lee Stern as he helped found Children's Creative Response to Violence (CCRV) and the Alternatives to Violence Project (AVP). CCRV has had serious impact on K-8 education in the United States including introduction of the Peer Mediation Program. AVP seeks to build beloved community in prisons. For more than forty years it has worked with prison inmates to build spread peaceful community life in prison. In recent years, AVP has been the basis for building beloved communities in the Great Lakes Region of Africa. In the 1980s, FOR took the lead in initiating the Nuclear Freeze Campaign in cooperation with other groups. They initiated a US- USSR reconciliation program, which included people-to-people exchanges, artistic and educational resources, teach-ins and conferences. They led nonviolence training seminars in the Philippines prior to the nonviolent overthrow of the Marcos dictatorship. In the 1990s, the organization sent delegations of religious leaders and peace activists to Iraq to try to prevent war and later, to see the massive devastation caused by the economic sanctions imposed upon Iraq. They initiated a \\"Start the Healing\\" campaign in response to escalating levels of gun violence in the United States, and FOR is an organizational and founding member of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, which advocates gun control. FOR initiated the \\"Bosnian Student Project,\\" which brought students from the former Yugoslavia out of war zones and into US homes and schools, and later started the International Reconciliation Work Camp Project. They also worked to get the US military to withdraw from Panama.  2000s: ‚ÄúI Will Not Kill‚Äù campaign and visiting Iran  FOR has most recently been active in advocating for the demilitarization of US foreign policy. It works to counter military recruitment of young people in the United Statesthrough FOR's \\"I Will Not Kill\\" campaign, and in partnership with the Ruckus Society, the War Resisters League, and others in the Not Your Soldier project. A July 2016 action in Minneapolis, in response to the death of Philando Castile, included the statement \\"Among their demands are the dismantling of the police department... disarming, defunding, demilitarizing, and disbanding police.\\" Particular areas of geographic focus have been the Middle Eastespecially Israel‚ÄìPalestine and Iranand Latin America and the Caribbeanespecially Colombia and Puerto Rico. In the Middle East, FOR's Interfaith Peace-Builders program (now independent) builds relationships between Israeli, Palestinian, and North American peace activists. Founded in 2005, its Iran program has drawn on FOR's legacy of sending delegations to nations that are labeled as enemies by the US government, and is working to prevent war and create peace-centered connections between ordinary citizens of both countries. In the Americas, FOR has a permanent five-person Colombia peace team of volunteers who provide human rights accompaniment to endangered civilians and support locally organized peace initiatives. FOR was also instrumental in the movement to pressure the US Navy to stop using Vieques as a bombing range.  2017: Anti-Israel workshop controversy  In 2017 the non-profit The Israel Group submitted complaints to the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) and the Orange County Department of Education regarding a workshop, ‚ÄúLearning About Islam and the Arab World‚Äù, that the Greater L.A. chapter of the FORUSA presented in the school districts. FOR has also been an active promoter of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, a perspective which informs its efforts to influence educators about the Middle East. One attendee of the workshop told the Jewish Journal, \\"We are being told that the Palestinians are the victims and the Jews are the oppressors, categorically and totally... And we are being told that Hamas is not a terrorist group; Hamas is a noble entity defending the rights of Palestinians.‚Äù In a news release from the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the human rights organization further noted that \\"FORUS is closely aligned with CAIR, a US-based organization that has been linked to Hamas terrorist group.\\" Greater public awareness followed the workshop, with groups such as the Anti- Defamation League (ADL) speaking out, saying the workshop materials featured \\"substantial misrepresentations and distortions of established historical facts, omissions of relevant facts, and inflammatory language\\". Democratic Congressman Brad Sherman contacted LAUSD.

He was briefly Minister of PTT in 1930, and was Minister of Commerce and Industry in 1932‚Äì33. He authored the first proposal for what became the 1937 International Exposition of Art and Technology in Modern Life. Early years Julien Auguste John Eug√®ne Durand was born on 25 May 1874 in Naples, Italy. He received his secondary education from the Marist Brothers in Besan√ßon and then at the lyc√©e in Brest. He studied law at the Faculty of Dijon, and in 1900 enrolled in the bar of Besan√ßon. He later became president of the bar. He specialized in civil and commercial law. He was elected to the municipal council of Besan√ßon in 1908. During World War I (1914‚Äì18) he served as a lieutenant with the 64th Infantry Regiment, and then at the headquarters of the 129th Infantry Division. He was awarded the Croix de Guerre. Political career Durand ran for election to the legislature in the general elections of 16 November 1919 on the Democratic Union list, but was not successful. While still a municipal councilor for Besan√ßon, and from 1922 a general councilor for the Doubs department, he was elected to the legislature in the general elections on 11 May 1924. He ran on the Left Cartel list, and joined the Radical and Radical Socialist group in the chamber of deputies. He joined the committees on Civil & Criminal Legislation, and Commerce & Industry. From 1926 he chaired the committee on commerce & industry. He was a Freemason, as were many French politicians in inter-war period. Durand was reelected in the second round in the general elections of 22‚Äì29 April 1928. He joined the committees on Customs and Commerce & Industry. In December 1929 Durand submitted a proposal for a decorative arts exposition similar to the 1925 International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts. He said that this exposition had helped France's balance of trade, spread French taste and fostered collaboration between artists and manufacturers. However, after the Wall Street Crash of 1929 there was less interest in a purely aesthetic exhibition, and more in one that focused on international cooperation. Durand was Minister of Posts, Telegraphs, and Telephones from 21 February 1930 to 2 March 1930 in the short- lived cabinet of Camille Chautemps. In the autumn of 1930 he chaired a committee that studied the organization of a European postal union. In 1931 he was appointed to the board of the Office of Foreign Trade, while chairing the committee on commerce and industry. He was reelected in the second round in the general elections on 1‚Äì8 May 1932, and was appointed Minister of Commerce and Industry when the cabinet of √âdouard Herriot was formed on 3 June 1932. Durand participated in the Lausanne conference on German reparations in June 1932. The British wanted to cancel German reparations, while the French were unwilling to go further than suspension, which was agreed. In October 1932 Durand's proposal for an exposition of the arts was combined with two others to form the basis for the 1937 Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne. Durand retained his ministry in the cabinet of Joseph Paul-Boncour from 18 December 1932 until its fall on 28 January 1933. Later career Durand was defeated in the April‚ÄìMay 1936 general elections.

It is set in a 1941 alternative timeline in which the United Kingdom is occupied by Nazi Germany during the Second World War. Europe as described in the show nine months after the Royal Air Force lost the Battle of Britain to the German Luftwaffe. The southern part of Great Britain is controlled by the German Reich while the northern part is an unoccupied zone even though there is still conflict in the area. Background In the alternative world, it is November 1941, nine months after a successful German invasion of Britain. Winston Churchill has been executed, and King George VI is a prisoner who has not been seen in public for some time. The Queen Mother and her daughters Elizabeth and Margaret escaped. A British government in exile, led by Rear-Admiral Conolly, exists but is not recognised by the United States. Germany has also maintained friendly relations with the Soviet Union, and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has just flown in to oversee the removal of the body of Karl Marx to the Soviet Union. Douglas Archer, a Scotland Yard murder squad Detective Superintendent with a stellar reputation, is working under a German superior from the Schutzstaffel (SS), the security force of the Nazi Party. Though his wife was killed by a German bombing raid in the Blitz, Archer avoids involvement in political crimes and views resistance to the Nazis as futile. A routine murder investigation becomes political when it appears to have been perpetrated by agents of the British Resistance. An aggressive SS officer arrives and takes control of the investigation, which is of interest to the SS because the victim may have possessed data from the German Army's programme to produce an atomic bomb. Archer also learns that his secretary and lover, Sylvia Manning, is a member of the British Resistance, and he is reluctantly drawn into a conspiracy against the Germans.  Production  In November 2014, it was announced that the BBC had commissioned writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade to adapt Len Deighton's novel SS-GB. In August 2015, it was announced that Sam Riley was in talks to star in the lead role of Detective Superintendent Douglas Archer of Scotland Yard. Riley's casting was confirmed in late September 2015. Production began in October 2015 and ended in January 2016. The series was produced by Sid Gentle Films Ltd. It was broadcast on BBC One in five one-hour episodes from 19 February 2017 and 19 March 2017. The series filmed various scenes for episodes 1 to 4 at the Chatham Historic Dockyard in Kent. The location was used as a double for London streets and the mortuary that featured in episode 1.

The review by The Guardian awarded three of five stars based on a viewing of the first two episodes.

It was built . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Federal Hotel is a two-storey timber hotel on a major street intersection at Childers and was constructed for hotelier William Ashby, following the redevelopment of the town centre after a major fire in 1902. Following logging of the dense Isis Scrub in the 1870s, Childers, in the heart of the scrub, was promoted in the 1880s by Maryborough interests as an agricultural district. The land in the immediate vicinity of the present town of Childers was surveyed in 1882 into 50-acre farm blocks. There was no official town survey; Childers developed following the private subdivision of portions 870 and 871, at the railhead of the 1887 Isis railway line from Isis Junction. This was opened on 31 October 1887, and was intended principally to facilitate the transport of timber from the scrub. William Ashby, who had arrived in Bundaberg in 1868, owned the first hotel in Childers. He moved to the Isis in the early 1800s and took up a large selection near Horton, building a hotel near the racecourse there. In 1886, he moved the hotel building to Childers and enlarged it as the \\"Childers Hotel\\". Ashby also acquired adjoining allotments, a store and butchery and was a member of the Isis Divisional Board. The area developed quickly as the coming of the railway not only promoted the development of the town of Childers; it also proved the catalyst for the establishment of a sugar industry in the district in the late 1880s. At the opening of the railway to Childers, Robert Cran, owner of Maryborough's Yengarie mill, announced that he would erect a double crushing juice mill at Doolbi, to supply his mill at Yengarie. This was completed in 1890, with the juice being brought in railway tankers from the Isis. Further expansion of the sugar industry in the Isis was closely related to the activities of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which erected a central crushing mill in the district 1893-94, and began crushing in 1895. By 1895, at least three other mills had been established in the Isis, with another two under construction, and Childers had emerged as the flourishing centre of a substantial sugar-growing district: in the years between 1891 and 1900 the population grew from 91 to 4000. The growth of the Isis district in the 1890s is reflected in the series of hotels constructed in Childers to accommodate travellers, businessmen and the many seasonal workers in the sugar industry. These included the Isis, Belle Vue, Royal, Queen's and Palace hotels. Ashby sold the Childers Hotel to Johann Kulick, who replaced it in 1899 with a handsome two-storey brick building called the Grand Hotel. This was the only building to survive a disastrous fire in 1902 that destroyed most of the timber buildings on that side of the main street in town. In 1902-3 the town centre was rebuilt with fashionable new brick buildings more in keeping with Childers' success, many of them to the design of F H Faircloth, a successful Bundaberg architect, who had designed the first Palace Hotel in 1897. In 1903 the old Isis Divisional Board was abolished and Isis Shire proclaimed, with the new seat of municipal government moving from Howard to Childers. It is said locally that Ashby approached Kulick in the early 1900s with a view to purchasing the Grand Hotel, before deciding to construct a new hotel diagonally opposite the Grand. The land on which the Federal Hotel is situated was originally granted as a selection to Ernest Dyne but changed hands before being extensively subdivided into town lots in 1892. William Ashby purchased several lots of land on the corner of Churchill and North Streets in 1905 and constructed the Federal Hotel around 1907. He also built a store on the adjoining block. This area of North Street appears to have developed as an offshoot of the nearby shopping area in the main street and was no doubt assisted by the presence of the hotel. The new hotel was very similar in appearance to a Gladstone hotel designed by F H Faircloth in 1900 and may also have been designed by him, as he was then carrying out extensive work in Childers, following the fire. Scottish pipers passing the Federal Hotel, November 1908 The hotel was leased to Hugh Carter from 1 January 1908 and it was leased for much of its existence, though it remained in possession of the Ashby family for many years after his death in 1920. It was patronised by canecutters, in the days when the cane harvest was brought in by hand, and later by small crop pickers. In 1968, it was purchased by Earl and Josephine Gillespie, after which it changed hands frequently over the next 20 years, before being purchased by Martin and Barbara Woods in 1989. It has been extensively refurbished.  Description  The Federal Hotel is a timber two- storey hotel located on the northern side of Childers main street, Churchill Street, at the corner of North Street. The hotel is approximately L-shaped in plan with the roof, core structure and awnings truncated at the corner facing the intersection. It is set on very low stumps and has a hipped roof clad in corrugated iron with shallow decorated gables at the centre of each street elevation. The hotel's major external feature is a two-storey verandah running along both streets, which is supported on paired and single posts with decorative cast iron brackets on both levels. The upper level has panels of cast iron balustrading above a pierced valance. The hotel has several entrances on the ground floor and accommodation on the upper floor, following the usual internal layout of two storey hotels in Queensland. The principal entrance is at the street corner and opens onto a large public bar through bat wing doors. Leading from this on the North Street side are a further bar and dining area. On the Churchill Street side is a second major entrance leading into a wide hall. This has a billiard room to the left and a central arch leading onto a staircase with turned balusters to the rear. There are sash windows to the ground floor rooms and timber ceilings. Although alterations have been carried out in the bar and dining areas, the hotel is generally intact in detail. There is a single storey kitchen section, which appears to have originally been detached but is now linked to the main building, set behind the dining area. The upper floor of the hotel contains a guest lounge at the street corner and there is a kitchen and bedrooms leading off the central halls that run along each wing. French doors open onto the verandah and toilets have been added to the upper level at the rear. There is a beer garden behind the hotel.  Heritage listing  The Federal Hotel was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Federal Hotel is important as one of a number of hotels which were erected in Childers within a few years of each other in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, illustrating the unprecedented growth then occurring in the Isis, when Childers was emerging as the flourishing centre of a substantial sugar-growing district. Much of the built character of the town reflects the rebuilding of the commercial centre following a disastrous fire in 1902, when the simpler structures of the early settlement were replaced, largely to the design of architect George Faircloth The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Federal Hotel, in its corner siting, form, layout and detail, is a good example of a hotel of its era. Change to the hotel has been minimal as the exterior is virtually unchanged and the layout of the interior remains much the same following renovations. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. As a well designed timber building on a prominent corner site, the Federal Hotel is a landmark in the main street of Childers and contributes to the architecturally coherent and picturesque townscape. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. It is associated with the community of Childers as a public building that has formed part of the recreational life of the town for most of the 20th century.

Built about 1883, it is a fine example of Italianate architecture, built for one of the principals of the Maine Red Granite Quarry Company. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. It is now owned by the National Park Service, housing facilities that support operation of the adjacent St. Croix Island International Historic Site. Description and history The McGlashan- Nickerson House is located in southern Calais, set on a rise overlooking Red Beach Cove, an indentation of the tidal St. Croix River. Abutting to the south is the publicly accessible land portion of the St. Croix Island International Historic Site, and directly to the east stands the Gothic Revival Joshua Pettegrove House. The McGlashan House is a rambling 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, its rectangular main block capped by a hip roof and finished in clapboard siding. A long two-story ell extends eastward, joining it to a carriage house. The main block is three bays wide, with an elaborate center entrance that has sidelight and transom windows, and pilasters supporting and an entablature with a shallow gable. To its left is a single-story projecting window bay. The building's cornices are bracketed, and there is a porch extending along part of the ell, supported by bracketed chamfered posts. The house was built about 1883 for George McGlashan, a Scottish immigrant who was a part owner of the Maine Red Granite Quarry Company. This company was one of two industrial concerns that operated on Red Beach Cove, neither of whose buildings have survived. McGlashan died in 1888, and his widow sold the house to Samuel Nickerson, whose family owned the property until 1985. It is now owned by the National Park Service, and provides housing and other support facilities for the adjacent historic site.

It was designed by Anton Hettrich built from 1899 to 1900. It is also known as Childers Hotel. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Grand Hotel in Childers, circa 1910 The two-story brick Grand Hotel was built in 1899 for Johann Wilhelm Albert Kulick by Bundaberg architect Anton Hettrich on the site of Childers first hotel. The new hotel was one of 5 hotels established in the 1890s in the newly emerging sugar town of Childers. Following logging of the dense Isis Scrub in the 1870s, Childers, in the heart of the scrub, was promoted in the 1880s by Maryborough interests as an agricultural district. The land in the immediate vicinity of the present town of Childers was surveyed in 1882 into farm blocks. There was no official town survey; Childers developed following the private subdivision of portions 870 and 871, at the railhead of the 1887 Isis railway line from Isis Junction. This was opened on 31 October 1887, and was intended principally to facilitate the transport of timber from the scrub. The coming of the railway not only promoted the development of the town of Childers; it also proved the catalyst for the establishment of a sugar industry in the district in the late 1880s. At the opening of the railway to Childers, Robert Cran, owner of Maryborough's Yengarie mill, announced that he would erect a double crushing juice mill at Doolbi, to supply his mill at Yengarie. This was completed in 1890, with the juice being brought in railway tankers from the Isis. Further expansion of the sugar industry in the Isis was closely related to the activities of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which erected a central crushing mill in the district 1893-94, and began crushing in 1895. By 1895, at least three other mills had been established in the Isis, with another two under construction, and Childers had emerged as the flourishing centre of a substantial sugar- growing district: in the years between 1891 and 1900 the population grew from 91 to 4000. In 1903 the old Isis Divisional Board (1886) was abolished and Isis Shire proclaimed, with the new seat of municipal government moving from Howard to Childers. William Ashby was one of the first generation of purchasers of town land following the subdivision of portion 870. He had previously been a publican and in 1886 moved a modest timber hotel in sections from nearby Horton and erected it on his land as the Childers Hotel. This was for several years the only hotel in the town and was described in 1892 as a \\"comfortable hostelry\\". In 1894 the site was enlarged to its present size when Ashby purchased the adjoining block. In the same year three more hotel licenses were granted for the Queen's Hotel, the Bellevue Hotel, and the Royal Hotel and in 1898 the Palace Hotel opened. In 1897 the Childers Hotel was purchased by Johann Kulick who replaced it with a new two story brick hotel in 1899 to the design of Bundaberg architect Anton Hettrich. Anton Hettrich (1860-1946) emigrated to Queensland from Germany around 1884 when he set up in practice as an architect in Bundaberg; soon after winning competitions for the Bundaberg Town Hall and the School of Arts. He also designed the Primitive Methodist Church and Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church in Childers. Frederick Faircloth, who later designed many buildings in Childers, was his pupil. The new hotel was called the Grand Hotel and photographs show how it dominated the townscape; towering over the row of single story timber shops which lined the southern side of the street prior and the single story timber buildings housing government and banking services on the northern side. In 1902 a devastating fire swept through the southern side of the street, destroying all of the buildings in this block except the brick Grand Hotel. Following this fire, new and elegant brick shops and a new Palace Hotel were constructed which radically altered the appearance of the street and more closely matched the style and detail of the Grand Hotel. Photographs taken in the early 1900s show that the hotel had decorative cast iron balustrading on the verandahs and a widow's walk at the peak of roof. A 1902 photograph shows a single story brick building with a corrugated iron roof to the rear of hotel as well as a small building with a chimney to the rear of that building. These are presumably service buildings and it is not known if these were part of the new construction or had belonged to the former hotel building. By 1908 the verandah had been extended to the eastern elevation which gave a covered way along the western boundary of the site at ground level. By this time the centre of Childers was a thriving commercial centre and had many new commercial buildings including the Federal Hotel built in 1907-8, across the road from the Grand, by William Ashby. In 1896 the railway line linked Childers to Cordalba, and later extended on to Dallamil and Booyal, which helped to build the number of settlers in the area and brought more people into Childers for shopping and recreation. As the sugar industry developed, the population of the district was swelled enormously by seasonal workers who came in to cut the cane harvest by hand. Special Saturday trains were laid on to take workers into Childers for shopping and to return them late at night. This influx of business contributed in a major way to the prosperity of the town. The closure of some mills in the Interwar period and the changeover to mechanical harvesting in the 1960s substantially reduced this influx of seasonal labour and the change to road transport saw the closure of rail link to Booyal closed in 1955 and to Childers itself in 1964. The town currently supports two operational hotels, the Hotel Childers and the Grand Hotel.  Description  The Grand Hotel is prominently situated on the corner of Churchill and McIwraith Streets, Childers. It is a two storey brick building with a trapezoidal plan form that follows the street alignment. The building has a wide surrounding two storeyed timber verandah with a convex curved corrugated iron roof. The brick walls of the building rise above the verandah at the first floor level and are decorated with a number of raised Greek crosses at the corners, long rendered sign panels and a continuous birdsmouth string course. The cast iron balustrade has been removed and the timber frame has been enclosed with fibre cement sheet. A small section of the cast iron balustrade survives on the southern verandah. The main roof, which is clad in corrugated iron, is hipped and surmounted by the remains of a \\"widows walk\\". The decorative cast iron balustrade has been removed from this section of the building. There is a dormer window in the north face of the main roof which has a projecting gabled roof supported by timber brackets and surmounted by a short finial. The gable is infilled with a decorated timber bracket. A decorated cylindrical vent survives on the western face of the main roof. Built hard up against the west verandah is a two storeyed brick building with a rectangular floor plan and hipped roof, which now serves as accommodation, bottle store and kitchen. A single storey convex corrugated iron verandah supported on timber posts is situated on the western elevation. The windows are double hung timber and the pair of windows on the west elevation have hoods. Attached to the east of this what may be the original kitchen, a single storeyed section with a pyramid roof. The main entrance to the building is through a pair of heavy timber double doors with a half light over to a central hallway. To the west is the bar area, this has been opened up to form one space. Double hung timber windows open out onto the footpath in this area. To the east of the main hall is a large space that runs from the front to the back of the building, the transverse walls have been removed and there is a bar at the south end. This space opens through a single door onto an area beneath the southern verandah. The kitchen and bottle shop runs beside this with the hotel manager's accommodation section over. The first floor is accessed via a timber half turn stair that has turned newel posts and turned balusters. The stair rises to a landing which has corridors leading off in three directions. These lead to accommodation rooms through four panel timber doors. The rooms are divided with vertical timber tongue and grooved boards mounted on an exposed timber post and rail frame. Each room opens onto the verandah via timber French doors. The south east and south west sections of the verandah has been enclosed for toilets and showers.  Heritage listing  The Grand Hotel was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Grand Hotel is one of a number of hotels which were erected in Childers within a few years of each other in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As a provider of food, accommodation and entertainment, the number and size of hotels in a town were used as an indicator of the prosperity of a district. The Grand, as the earliest of the surviving hotels in Childers, illustrates the unprecedented growth then occurring in the Isis, when Childers was emerging as the flourishing centre of a substantial sugar-growing district. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Grand Hotel, by its siting, form and detail is a good example of a late nineteenth century hotel. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The hotel is a landmark in the main street and the roof has been frequently used as a vantage point for taking photographs of the town. By its scale, form, materials and detail it contributes to the architecturally coherent and picturesque townscape, acting as a visual termination to the visual rhythm of the main shopping block. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Although some of the decorative elements of the hotel have been removed, it has a special association with Bundaberg architect Anton Hettrich as a fine example of his work.

He was editor of all of these titles until the closure of Sanctuary Press in 1992. He also edited Lodestar with Jeffrey Hamm from 1985 to 1992. Row was assaulted or intimidated several times during his fascist activities. In 1963, six young men of the anti-fascist Yellow Star Movement broke into the Union Movement headquarters at 302 Vauxhall Bridge Road and assaulted Row and Keith Gibson, the movement's political secretary.\\"Two Hurt in Raid on Mosley H.Q.\\", The Times, 13 May 1963, p. 12. All six were arrested and later fined (one aged 16 was bound over) at the Old Bailey after pleading guilty to assault and causing damage to property.\\"Raiders of Mosley H.Q. Fined\\", The Times, 23 July 1963, p. 13. According to testimony, Row was made to kneel on the floor and rip up copies of Action.\\"Editor \\"Made To Kneel\\", The Times, 5 June 1963, p. 16. Both Row and Gibson required hospital treatment. Soon after, according to Comrade, he was attacked again by the same group on his way home from work. Row was close to Raven Thomson politically and in the early 1950s supported his view that the Union Movement should move closer to the neo-Nazism that was gaining some support in Germany, rather than Mosley's unpopular \\"Europe a Nation\\" policy. Later, with Jeffrey Hamm, he was a key figure in Action. Increasingly, in the post-war decades, Row through his writings became a unifying force for the dwindling and ageing band of former BUF members as the movement engaged less in political action and more in rhetoric and nostalgia for the BUF. Death Row remained a committed fascist until his death, continuing to contribute to publications of the offshoots of the BUF until the end, such as Comrade, newsletter of the Friends of Oswald Mosley. He died in 1999 after a minor operation. He was 83. His ashes were scattered by his niece in Lancashire at a site where he and his brothers cycled in his youth.\\"One of those Blackshirts\\", Comrade, No. 53, December 2000, pp. 2‚Äì3.

The company is headquartered in Hungary, Europe, with several subsidiaries and affiliates around the world, including Austria, Bulgaria, Singapore and the United States. History and overview Cellum is a corporate group that comprises several privately held companies. The first company was founded in 2000 by Bal√°zs Inotay under the name Enigma Software Inc. and focused on developing SIM-based cryptography and digital signature technology. The company was renamed to Cellum Innovations and Services Inc. and was moved under the Netherlands-based holding company Cellum BV, with a view to international expansion. A new company called Mobile Payment Provider Inc. was set up for operating the company group's infrastructure. At the same time, Cellum shifted its focus to providing mobile banking and carrier billing solutions to the market-leading mobile carriers in Hungary. In 2010, former Minister of Economy and Transport Dr. J√°nos K√≥ka joined Cellum first as an advisor, and then in 2011 he became CEO of the newly created Cellum Global Inc. affiliate, focusing on bringing Cellum's technologies to international markets. That same year, to support this expansion, Cellum Global received a EUR 1.5 million capital injection from PortfoLion, the venture fund of OTP Bank, at the time representing the largest such investment in Central Europe. On January 30, 2018, Cellum announced that Indonesia's partly state-owned telecommunications company Telkom Indonesia, through its PT MetraNet subsidiary, was making an investment in the company in two phases, eventually acquiring a 30.4% stake. Though the scale of the capital injection was not disclosed at the time, citing capital market rules, it was later reported by Indonesian press that the total value of the transaction was USD 6 million. Products and services Cellum provides a wide range of mobile transaction services based on various technologies. The main focus of the company is remote mobile payments, with several implementations of cloud-based mobile wallets, as well as carrier billing and closed-loop payments via NFC cards.

She played a prominent role in the organisation as she was the section leader of its Central branch, and eventually in later years became its 1st Lieutenant. Early life Lucy Agnes Smyth was born in 1882 in Dublin. Her father James Peter Joseph Smyth was a Brassfounder and her mother Mary Anne Smyth was a Housekeeper. According to the 1901 census, Lucy was living with her family in Amiens Street. She was 18 and her occupation was listed as Millinery Saleswoman - at that point she was living with her parents, her sister Isabella (28) and her brother James Leo (20). At the time of the 1911 census, by which point her father had died, Lucy's parents had 9 children, 5 of which were still living - Lucy being the youngest. When Lucy's father died, her brother James Leo became head of the house. When they moved to the residence in Rutland Square, Rotunda, Dublin Lucy became a member of the local St. Mary's Parish in Rotunda West, Dublin. Lucy Smyth was also a fluent Irish speaker. At the time of the 1911 census her occupation was a typist. Thomas F. Byrne and Smyth married on April 28, 1919. Shortly after they married they moved to Upper Eccles Street opposite the Mater Hospital. Early in 1920, Smyth and Byrne's first child died after a raid by the Black and Tans where Byrne was arrested and jailed. The couple were involved in the War of Independence. Her daughter Sheila wrote regarding her birth, \\"I should have been born in 1922, but my mother fell under the cat and I came early\\". In a witness statement by Elizabeth Colbert, sister of Conn Colbert who was executed in 1916, she describes her encounter with Smyth and her brother's love for Smyth. After her brother's execution, Elizabeth visited her house and Smyth showed her the letters she had received from Colbert. Elizabeth then quickly learned of her brother's love for Smyth, he described her as \\"the nicest girl in Dublin\\". Elizabeth then claimed that her brother would have married her had he not been executed. Father O‚ÄôMahony, a local parish priest, informed Smyth of a package that Conn Colbert had handed him to be delivered to Smyth. Smyth never received the package and went with Elizabeth to visit O‚ÄôMahony. He told Smyth that a young girl had offered to deliver it to her, he presumed she was a member of Cumann na mBan and that her last name was \\"Mc Namara\\". However, the parcel was never found as they were unable to trace its whereabouts. This was a big disappointment for both Smyth and Elizabeth Colbert. Conn Colbert was a rival of Smyth's husband, Tom Byrne. Role in Cumann na mBan and the Rising Cumann na mBan (Women's League) was formed in April 1913, and was known widely as the female version of the Irish volunteers. In 1913, a number of women decided to hold a meeting in Wynne's Hotel for the purpose of discussing the possibility of forming an organization for women who would work in conjunction with the recently formed Irish Volunteers. Cumann na mBan was the main female support organization working for the success of Sinn F√©in in the election. On April 4, Cumann na mBan was launched at a meeting held in the Pillar Room in the Mansion House. During the years 1914-1921, Smyth was heavily involved in the activities of Cumann na mBan. On Easter Monday in 1916, Smyth (aged 34 at the time) played a dangerous role of carrying the arms from a house prior to it being raided. The following day she was given the task of carrying vital messages to the GPO while also being a member of the first aid department. On 23 April 1916, the Military Council of the Irish Republican Brotherhood finalized arrangements for the Easter Rising, it included Cumann na mBan, along with the Irish Volunteers and Irish Citizen Army, into the Army of the Irish Republic. Patrick Pearse was appointed overall Commandant-General and James Connolly as Commandant-General of the Dublin Division. The day of the rising, forty Cumann na mBan members including Smyth herself entered the General Post Office (GPO) on O'Connell Street, Dublin with their male counterparts. They came to the site armed. As a member in the first aid movement, she attended to the wounded in the Hibernian Bank and the GPO. Smyth attended to the injured in the GPO and Hibernian Bank. Smyth continued to risk her life by helping carry injured Volunteers to Jervis Street Hospital despite the ongoing fighting being in very close proximity. She also nursed James Connolly. When the call came to rise, Byrne and fifteen volunteers in Maynooth marched to Dublin. Their feet were swollen from their long journey and Smyth offered Byrne a bowl of warm water to ease the pain. Later Byrne gave his future wife his watch and money for safe-keeping. Smyth's daughter Sheila O'Leary was one of the few people, and probably the only one left alive, whose parents were both in the GPO during Easter 1916. Smyth was awarded four medals, as well as the medal given to survivors on the 50th anniversary. Smyth was considered as an \\"ordinary\\" person who did extraordinary things. Death Smyth died at the age of 90, in November 1972. She is buried in Glasnevin cemetery in Dublin. She is buried along with her husband and son. Tom Byrne died 7 September 1962 aged 85 years old. Myles Byrne died in 1968 at the age of 41. ReferencesBibliography *Chumhaill, E. N. (2014, April 2). History of Cumann Retrieved from http://www.anphoblacht.com/contents/23897 *Colbert, E. M. (1916).

More than a third of parents in the US report using corporal punishment on children less than a year old, often with a slap on the hand. Researchers estimate that 85% of American youth have been physically punished by parents during childhood or adolescence. The most common form of physical punishment is spanking on the buttocks with an open hand. However, more than one in four parents have also reported using an object, such as a hairbrush or wooden spoon, to hit their children, according to a 1995 survey. According to Elizabeth Gershoff, these data, combined with the common use of wooden paddles to administer corporal punishment in schools, demonstrate \\"a prevailing acceptance of objects to deliver punishment\\". Race, gender, and social class appear to be significant factors in U.S. domestic corporal punishment patterns. Boys are more likely than girls to be spanked at home,Day, Randal, \\"Predicting Spanking of Younger and Older Children by their Mothers and Fathers,\\" Journal of Marriage and the Family 60 (February 1998): 79-94. and corporal punishment of boys tends to be more severe and more aggressive than that of girls.Straus, 1994; Kipnis, 1999; Kindlon and Thompson, 1999; Newberger, 1999; Hyman, 1997. Murray Straus suggests that corporal punishment is more harmful for boys than girls. While African- American parents are more likely to favor using corporal punishment, research has shown mixed results on whether physical punishment predicts adverse outcomes in this group. Affluent families at the upper end of the socioeconomic scale tend to spank the least often; middle‚Äëclass parents tend to administer corporal punishment in greater numbers, and lower‚Äëclass parents tend to do so with still greater frequency.Straus, M.A. and Donnelly, D.A. (1994). Beating the Devil Out of Them: Corporal Punishment in American Families. New York: Lexington Books. A 2014 real-time investigation of mothers in Texas found that nearly half used some form of corporal punishment during the duration of the study. Subjects tended to use spanking when angry and for trivial misdeeds, such as minor social transgressions by children. Those mothers who spanked tended to rely on spanking as a punishment rather than using it as a \\"last resort\\". These episodes of corporal punishment were not usually effective in stopping the unwanted behaviour. According to the study's lead author, George Holden, ‚ÄúThe recordings show that most parents responded either impulsively or emotionally, rather than being intentional with their discipline‚Äù, contrary to the advice of spanking advocates.\\"Corporal punishment study shows kids misbehave within 10 minutes of spanking\\". Southern Methodist University. 15 April 2014. The audio recordings used in the study revealed that mothers tended to spank their children, of varying ages, an average of eighteen times per week. Researchers had earlier estimated that American parents used corporal punishment an average of eighteen times per year. Based on these preliminary results, Holden suggests that studies using self-reports may dramatically underestimate the actual incidence of spanking by parents.Phillip, Abby (22 April 2014). \\"Parents still spank their kids for trivial reasons even when researchers are listening in\\". The Washington Post. Social acceptance Public support for parents' right to spank remains high in the U.S. despite a growing body of evidence linking corporal punishment by parents with numerous adverse effects such as aggression, antisocial behavior, anxiety, and depression in children. While support for corporal punishment among American adults has gradually declined since the 1960s, the practice remains more accepted than in European countries. Murray Straus at the University of New Hampshire argues that the decline in public support for corporal punishment since the 1960s is largely a result of the shift from an industrial to a post-industrial economic system. According to the 2004 General Social Survey, approximately 71 percent of American adults agreed with the statement that children sometimes need a \\"good, hard spanking\\", down from 84 percent in 1986. Through 2010 and 2012, that number held steady at approximately 70 percent.Enten, Harry (15 September 2014). \\"Americans‚Äô Opinions On Spanking Vary By Party, Race, Region And Religion\\" fivethirtyeight.com. Alternatives The American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and the National Mental Health Association suggest non-violent discipline as an alternative to corporal punishment.Parents, Kids, and Discipline. WebMD. retrieved 9/8/2016. http://www.webmd.com/parenting/guide/discipline-tactics#1 Techniques include: Rewarding good behavior, allowing natural consequences to instruct the child (along with explanations when necessary), disciplinary consequences that are tied to the aberrant behaviour (such as taking away toys when the child doesn't pick them up), and time-outs. The American Academy of Pediatrics discourages corporal punishment because the nonphysical discipline techniques work better and avoid the negative consequences of physical punishment, including: Making children more aggressive or more violent, potentially causing physical harm to them, and teaching them that it's acceptable to physically hurt a loved one. Professionals say the key to discipline include: communication, respect, consistency, moving on after the punishment is complete, matching discipline to the age of the child, and learning how to recognize when there may be some external factor driving a behaviour (such as being hungry or being bullied at school). In law In the majority of states, physical punishment by a parent remains legal under statutes making exceptions to the state's law on the crimes of assault, criminal battery, domestic violence, sexual assault, sexual abuse or child abuse. These exceptions usually establish that no crime has been committed when certain actions are applied to a minor by that child's parent or legal caregiver. However, the line between permitted corporal punishment and punishment legally defined as abuse varies by state and is not always clear (laws typically allow \\"reasonable force\\" and \\"non-excessive corporal punishment\\"). Such language is often vague and is necessarily subjective and fact-driven, so that most cases present a fact issue for trial as to reasonableness or non-excessiveness. Examples of law permitting bodily punishment of children include two different articles of the Minnesota Legislature allow parents and teachers to use corporal punishment as a form of discipline by creating explicit exceptions to the state's child abuse statutes for \\"reasonable and moderate physical discipline.\\"Minnesota Statutes 609.379.Minnesota Statutes 626.556. Application of exceptions for physical punishment raise legal issues as well. In 2008, the Minnesota Supreme Court considered a case involved a man who had struck his 12-year-old son 36 blows with a maple paddle. The trial court held that this constituted abuse, but was reversed on appeal. In affirming the reversal, the Minnesota Supreme Court stated that \\"We are unwilling to establish a bright- line rule that the infliction of any pain constitutes either physical injury or physical abuse, because to do so would effectively prohibit all corporal punishment of children by their parents\\" and \\"it is clear to us that the Legislature did not intend to ban corporal punishment\\".In Re: the Welfare of the Children of N.F. and S.F. https://caselaw.findlaw.com/mn-supreme- court/1116234.htmlOlson, Rochelle. \\"Court gets behind spanking, to a degree\\", Star Tribune, Minneapolis-St Paul, 30 May 2008. Administrative actions for the protection of the child may be initiated by child protection workers who become aware of corporal punishment that may endanger a child. The protection of such administrative actions is typically provided in the form of health department regulations, including Child Protective Services (CPS) rules or rules on Mandated reporting. Mandatory reporting laws require that persons witnessing certain visible injuries along with reports by a child of abuse to make report to the local CPS or equivalent agency charged with the protection of the child. Such agencies operate on definitions of child abuse provided by the state's health department (which are often very different from the exceptions provided in the criminal code). Child protection agencies typically have the duty and authority to investigate cases with their own agents, such as social workers. If the agency determines abuse has occurred, some administrative actions can be taken immediately without the involvement of the police or the courts. These can include warning the parent, referring the parent to counseling, flagging the parent's name in the agency database,Code of Maryland Regulations - 07.02.07.10 or, in egregious cases, even immediate removal of the child or children from the parent's home.Texas Department of Family and Protective Services -5250 Emergency Removal Without a Court Order The United Nations Human Rights Committee has noted its concern with the use of corporal punishment of children in settings including schools, penal institutions, homes, and \\"all forms of childcare at federal, state, and local levels\\". It recommended in April 2014 that the government take steps to eliminate corporal punishment in all settings, including through legislation, encouragement of non-violent forms of discipline, and informing the public about the harmful effects of corporal punishment. During the second Universal Periodic Review of human-rights practices in the United States, the report of the United Nations Human Rights Council also contained a recommendation to \\"Prohibit corporal punishment of children in all settings, including the home and schools, and ensure that the United States encourages non-violent forms of discipline as alternatives to corporal punishment\\". The US government accepted only the part of the recommendation concerning promotion of nonviolent discipline. Bans on the corporal punishment of children have been proposed in Massachusetts\\"Should Spanking Your Child Be Illegal?\\", ABC News, 28 November 2007. and CaliforniaZimmerman, Eileen. \\"Spanking mad\\", Salon.com, 5 February 2007.Vogel, Nancy. \\"Proposal to ban spanking is revised\\", Los Angeles Times, 23 February 2007. but have failed to secure passage.Sanders, Jim. \\"Spanking bill rejected\\", Sacramento Bee, California, 1 June 2007.\\"Country report for USA\\" (November 2015).

In 1977, the Supreme Court of the United States found that the Eighth Amendment clause prohibiting \\"cruel and unusual punishments\\" did not apply to school students, and that teachers could punish children without parental permission. 31 states and the District of Columbia have banned corporal punishment in public schools, though in some of these there is no explicit prohibition. Corporal punishment is also unlawful in private schools in Iowa and New Jersey. In 19 U.S. states, corporal punishment is lawful in both public and private schools.

Historically, a dominant raw material in South and South East Asia, the global bamboo industry has significantly grown in recent decades in part because of the high sustainability of bamboo as compared to other biomass cultivation strategies, such as traditional timber forestry. For example, as of 2016, the U.S. Fiber corporation Resource Fiber is contracting farmers in the United States for Bamboo cultivation. Or in 2009, United Nations Industrial Development Organization published guidelines for cultivation of bamboo in semi-arid climates in Ethiopia and Kenya. Because bamboo can grow on otherwise marginal land, bamboo can be profitably cultivated in many degraded lands. Moreover, because of the rapid growth bamboo is an effective Climate change mitigation and carbon sequestration crop, absorbing between 100 and 400 tonnes of carbon per hectare. In 1997, an international intergovernmental organization was established to promote the development of the bamboo cultivation, the International Bamboo and Rattan Organisation. Bamboo is harvested from both cultivated and wild stands, and some of the larger bamboos, particularly species in the genus Phyllostachys, are known as \\"timber bamboos\\". Bamboo is typically harvested as a source material for construction, food, crafts and other manufactured goods.

The International Solar Alliance (ISA) is an alliance of 121 countries initiated by India, most of them being sunshine countries, which lie either completely or partly between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. The primary objective of the alliance is to work for efficient consumption of solar energy to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. This initiative was first proposed by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a speech in November 2015 at Wembley Stadium(London HA9 0WS, United Kingdom), in which he referred to sunshine countries as Suryaputra (\\"Sons of the Sun\\"). The alliance is a treaty-based inter-governmental organization. Countries that do not fall within the Tropics can join the alliance and enjoy all benefits as other members, with the exception of voting rights. After the United Nations, it is the largest grouping of states world-wide. The initiative was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the India Africa Summit, and a meeting of member countries ahead of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in November 2015. The framework agreement of the International Solar Alliance opened for signatures in Marrakech, Morocco in November 2016, and 200 countries have joined. Headquarters The ISA is headquartered in Gurgaon, India. In January 2016, Narendra Modi, and the then French President Fran√ßois Hollande jointly laid the foundation stone of the ISA Headquarters and inaugurated the interim Secretariat at the National Institute of Solar Energy (NISE) in Gwal Pahari, Gurugram, India. The Indian government has dedicated five acres of land on the NISE campus for its future headquarters; it also has contributed to the fund to build a campus and for meeting expenditures for the first five years. The alliance is also called International Agency for Solar Policy and Application (IASPA). Objective The focus is on solar power utilization. The launching of such an alliance in Paris also sends a strong signal to the global communities about the sincerity of the developing nations towards their concern about climate change and to switch to a low-carbon growth path. India has pledged a target of installing 100GW by 2022 and reduction in emission intensity by 33‚Äì35% by 2030 to let solar energy reach to the most unconnected villages and communities and also towards creating a clean planet. India's pledge to the Paris summit offered to bring 40% of its electricity generation capacity (not actual production) from non-fossil sources (renewable, large hydro, and nuclear) by 2030. it is based on world co operation. Geographical importance The area of Earth located in between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn is called the tropical (torrid) zone. This is the part of the world in which the sun can appear directly overhead, and that more-direct exposure means that the sun's actual effect is greater here; anywhere north or south of this zone, sunlight always reaches the earth's surface at an angle and is correspondingly less intense. The sunniest countries of the world are on the African continent, ranging from Somalia- Horn of Africa-, east to Niger, west and north to Egypt. For India, possible additional benefits from the alliance can be a strengthening of ties with the major African countries and increasing goodwill for India among them. Members The alliance is a treaty-based inter-governmental organization. The framework agreement of the International Solar Alliance opened for signatures in Marrakech, Morocco in November 2016, on the sidelines of the Marrakech Climate Change Conference (the twenty-second session of the Conference of the Parties, or COP 22). On its first day (15 November), sixteen countries signed the Agreement: India, Brazil, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Dominican Republic, the Republic of Guinea, Mali; Nauru; Niger; Tanzania; Tuvalu; Cambodia; Ethiopia; Burkina Faso; Bangladesh and Madagascar. By 17 November, Guinea Bissau, Fiji, France also signed the agreement. On 6 November 2017 India's External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj held a meeting with Guinea's Foreign Minister, Mamady Toure. During the course of this meeting, Mamady Toure handed over Guinea's Instrument of Accession to the India-initiated International Solar Alliance (ISA). Vanuatu and Liberia also signed the agreement. Subsequently, an additional 107 countries joined the agreement, including all major countries that lie between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, including Mexico, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, Brazil, India, Australia, New Zealand, and China. A conclave started from 30 November 2015 for the sunshine grouping, called the InSPA (International Agency for Solar Policy & Application).

Initiatives and partnerships  Global Solar Atlas The alliance has partnered with World Bank to launch Global Solar Atlas at an ISA event at the World Future Energy Summit in Abu Dhabi. Global Solar Atlas is a free online tool that displays annual average solar power potential at any location in the world and thus identify potential sites for solar power generation. World Bank announced \\"This tool will help governments save millions of dollars on their own research and provide investors and solar developers with an easily accessible and uniform platform to compare resource potential between sites in one region or across multiple countries.\\" Riccardo Puliti, Senior Director and Head of the World Bank's Energy & Extractives Global Practice said ‚ÄúThe World Bank is seeing a surge of interest from our clients in solar power as a result of the dramatic cost decreases over the past few years. We hope that the Global Solar Atlas will help inform the crucial planning and investment decisions that will need to be taken over the next decade to shift to more sustainable forms of energy.‚Äù Piyush Goyal, Power Minister of India said ‚ÄúThis new tool will assist governments and investors to obtain an initial indication of solar resource potential before carrying out their own more detailed analysis.‚Äù  Future targets  India, with the support of France, has invited nations to facilitate infrastructure for implementation of solar projects. The alliance has committed one trillion dollars as investment, and it is committed to making the costs of solar power more affordable for remote and inaccessible communities. The alliance will endorse India in achieving its goal of generating 100 GW of solar energy and 175 GW of renewable energy by 2022. The countries shall support each other in research and development as well as other high level activities. It is also seen as an alliance by the developing countries to form a united front and to undertake research and development for making solar power equipment within developing countries. Progress On 30 June 2016, the alliance entered into an understanding with the World Bank for accelerating mobilization of finance for solar energy. The Bank will have a major role in mobilizing more than US$1 trillion in investments that will be needed by 2030, to meet ISA's goals for the massive deployment of affordable solar energy. Till date 74 countries have signed and 52 countries have ratified the Framework Agreement of the ISA. With ratifications by 15 countries, the ISA will become a treaty based inter-governmental international organisation and it will be recognized by UN legally to become fully functionable. At the World Future Energy Summit (WFES) held in Abu Dhabi in January 2018, the government of India announced the establishment of a $350 million solar development fund to enable financing of solar projects.

This replaces the traditional pork barrel, the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF), after the Pork barrel scam was uncovered in 2013.  History  During President Benigno Aquino III's term, he instituted budget reforms, as opposed to Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo's style of spending funds. Due to the reforms, he reduced funds in some, added a little in some, and the rest is reserved for emergencies like disasters and crisis management and foreign debts and deficits. The consequence is a lot of funds unspent, slower fund release and sometimes, underspent funds were returned to the National Treasury. In order to solve the problem, the President, along with his budger secretary and fellow Liberal party member Florencio Abad, instituted a program that accelerates fund spending in all public works and agencies badly needing funds.  Issues  DAP was rumoured to be used by Aquino and Abad to bribe senators and congressmen to impeach and oust Renato Corona. According to some senators and representatives, the DAP was used to buy their vote. Both Malaca√±ang and Abad denied the accusations and defended their actions as \\"in good faith\\".

It includes a sophisticated Colonial Revival mansion house, built in 1900, and a variety of agricultural outbuildings dating to the same period. The estate, and in particular its barnyard complex, are well-preserved remnants of this era. The property is also notable for its association with Rudyard Kipling, who owned the estate for several years. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. The district covers of what is now the main campus of the World Learning organization, a larger subset of the original Dickinson Estate. Description and history The former Dickinson Estate is located in rural northern Brattleboro, near its border with Dummerston, on the west side of Kipling Road. The World Learning campus occupies more than of a large farm property that was known in the 19th century as the Bliss Farm. In 1899 the Bliss Farm was purchased by Frederick and Harriet Dickinson; he was a prominent local businessman, she the daughter of a New York City millionaire. The farm became the core of a gentleman's farm country estate that reached at its greatest extent. The Dickinsons built a 20-room Colonial Revival mansion house (to a design by Belgian architect Maurice Fornachon), and constructed a number of agricultural outbuildings to support farm operations on the property, demolishing most of the older buildings on the farm in the process. The only older building to survive on the property is an 1860s Greek Revival cottage, in which the Kiplings gave birth to their daughter while construction of nearby Naulakha was underway. The central portion of the Dickinson estate was purchased in 1937 by Thomas Bibby, who continued to operate the farm. His widow remarried, to Henry Persons, a principal in the Experiment in International Living, now World Learning. That organization bought a subset of the estate (excluding the main complex of farm buildings) in 1962, and gradually expanded its holdings to more than . The property is historically significant as having one of the few surviving country estate houses left in Brattleboro, and for its remarkably well-preserved early-20th century farmyard, which was also designed by the architect Fornachon. The elaborate and deliberate arrangement of the buildings in the farm complex is particularly unique in the state.

The series premiered on CBC on October 8, 1984, and ended on February 26, 1989, after 65 episodes over five seasons. Summary The Elephant Show features the adventures of the Canadian singing trio Sharon, Lois & Bram and Elephant (Paula Gallivan in an elephant costume). Elephant doesn't speak but is voiced by a tuba (played by Scott Irvine), which conveys thoughts and mood by its pitch and inflection. The four are usually accompanied by a group of children and a sidekick, family entertainer Eric Nagler. Every week Sharon, Lois & Bram, along with Eric Nagler, are joined by the curious and fun-loving antics of their pachyderm pal Elephant and such guest artists as Toller Cranston, Louis Del Grande, Jayne Eastwood, Murray McLauchlan, Chuck Mangione, Andrea Martin, The Nylons, and Jan Rube≈°. Almost every episode contains a concert segment, featuring Sharon, Lois & Bram, Eric, and the Mammoth Band. They sing songs and help children with their problems (including arguments, fear, and the failure of plans). In most episodes, the group travels to a new location (such as a hospital, museum, or zoo). They occasionally stay home and have an adventure in their yard (like building a tree fort or encountering a grumpy neighbour). The show occasionally includes a social lesson (such as a pro-UNICEF discussion). Sharon, Lois and Bram appeared in advertisements during the show's original run, encouraging parents to vaccinate their children against polio, mumps, and rubella. Each episode concludes with the song \\"Skinnamarink\\", which was often performed twice. The show enjoyed top ratings in Canada and had consistently been rated one of the top three programs on Nickelodeon in the United States. In 1993, a panel of experts at TV Guide rated The Elephant Show the #2 program for preschoolers, beating Sesame Street (#5) and Barney & Friends (#9). In the years following the final season, the show remained on Nickelodeon until they removed it from their lineup in 1994. By that time, The Elephant Show had aired 65 episodes in five seasons (plus the specials Live in Your Living Room and Back by Popular Demand, which compiled concert performances from the show with some new narration), and had been viewed in Australia, Canada, Great Britain, Greece, Hong Kong, Ireland, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Africa, and the United States, reaching over 100 million viewers.

He is the artistic director of Cornerstone Theater Company in Los Angeles. He has received several awards and grants, including the Alan Schneider Director Award and the Princess Grace Fellowship. Early life and education Garc√©s was born in Miami, Florida, the son of Sergio, an accountant, and Lee, but grew up in Colombia. His family soon moved to Colombia following his birth due to a job opportunity for Sergio. His family lived in Medell√¨n, Colombia until Garc√©s was 13 and it was in Medell√¨n where Garc√©s was first exposed to political issues, like the wealth gap between the rich and poor, that would later be integrated into his work. It was also during his time living in Medell√¨n when Garc√©s first started doing theater, around the 5th or 6th grade. After living in Medell√¨n, his family moved to Bogot√†, Colombia where he got a role as one of Jesus's apostles in a touring production of the musical Godspell, which received national attention because Godspell was one of the few American musicals to come to Colombia. His family eventually moved back to Miami and around the time Garc√©s was preparing to go to college, he and has father disagreed about the direction of his life. His father believed working a company job was valuable, but Garc√©s did not want to pursue this type of career. This led him to the University of Miami where he received his BFA in theater.  Career  After graduating from the University of Miami, Garc√©s moved to New York City in 1989 to pursue a career in theater. He quickly found an internship at INTAR, a Hispanic theater company, as a production assistant. This internship launched a career in theater in New York as an actor, director, and playwright that lasted for 16 years. Of his time in New York, Garc√©s says that much of his work was spent \\"focusing on my desire to learn about why one does this form, rather than why one does one's show.\\" Garc√©s initially traveled to New York to work as an actor, but soon began writing his own pieces and directing the works of his peers after becoming frustrated with acting. Garc√©s worked for Max Ferr√° at INTAR who not only encouraged Garc√©s to create an actors group, which became the NewWorks Lab, but also advised Garc√©s to pursue directing. After his time in New York, Garc√©s worked in a number of regional theaters across the country, including the Kentucky's Actors Theatre of Louisville and the Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company in Washington, D.C. During this time, he was honored with the Princess Grace Statue Award for distinguished accomplishment in the theater and the Alan Schneider Director Award and received a New Generations Grant from the Theater Communications Group. He also moved briefly to Chiapas, Mexico for an 8-week residency in a Mayan writers' collective where he directed one of the plays that was being performed. His time in Mexico greatly affected Garc√©s. He claims that \\"the impact, the quality of the aesthetic experience people were having watching the play, was so profound, so electric\\" and it was this experience which he believes led him to his current place of work, Cornerstone Theater Company. Cornerstone Theater Company is a community-focused theater group in Los Angeles. Garc√©s describes it as \\"professional community theater,\\" as professional playwrights, directors, and designers who are hired to work on specific shows go into and engage with the communities that the plays are about. Most of the plays written are fictitious, but are based on the stories told by the community members who are engaged by Cornerstone. Once a play is written, playwrights like Garc√©s will go back into the communities and do readings of the piece to hear feedback from community members. Garc√©s claims that Cornerstone is a theater that produces plays \\"about communities that are trying to define themselves\\" which is why community engagement is so necessary for the theater. Cornerstone is also a space that produces multiethnic pieces of theater, which allows Garc√©s to discuss issues relevant to the Latino population like Latino immigration and the status of undocumented immigrants in the United States. The first script he wrote with Cornerstone Theater Company was the play Los Illegals, about the experience of immigrants from South and Central American attempting to cross the border between the United States and Mexico. Some of his inspiration for the piece came from experiences he's had interacting with undocumented immigrants. During the summers in between semesters while in college, Garc√©s would work with contractors in Queens, some of whom were undocumented Latino and Greek individuals. Garc√©s also interacted with undocumented agricultural workers while rehearsing a play he was producing in Florida later in his career before he came to Cornerstone. After coming to Cornerstone, Garc√©s was interested in exploring similar communities of undocumented immigrants in Los Angeles and began venturing out into the community to speak with individuals about their experiences, at places like Home Depot. He also spoke with individuals at the National Day Laborer Organizing Network to inform his piece. Garc√©s claims that the \\"heart of the story\\" is \\"about folks who were here and grappling with documentation, the legality or illegality of their residence, and their ability to work that.\\" Though the piece is focused on the act of crossing the border, Garc√©s states that it is also about the inner conflict that undocumented immigrants experience once they arrive in the United States. Garc√©s has been involved in various theater organizations in the United States, including The National Endowment for the Arts, New York State Council on the Arts, Colorado Council on the Arts, the City of Pasadena - Cultural Affairs Division, the Bush Foundation, the Mid-Atlantic Arts Foundation, Theatre Communications Group, NYFA, ART/NY, The Playwright's Center, the Andrew W.

Gray created scientifically organised collections of fossils for several museums. Life Elizabeth Anderson was born in Alloway in 1831. She and her family moved to Enoch near Girvan in Ayrshire where they farmed and Elizabeth attended a small private school. Her father was described as an enthusiastic collector of fossils who had a type of trilobite named after him. Anderson was sent to a boarding school in Glasgow when she was fifteen. She stayed for a year and then returned to help in the home.R. J. Cleevely, 'Gray , Elizabeth (1831‚Äì1924)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 18 Nov 2015 Marriage (and holidays in Girvan) She married Robert Gray on 8 April 1856 and they both shared an interest in collecting fossils each holiday back in Girvan. She was assisted by their children when they were able. They lived in Glasgow, where Robert worked in a bank, and their holidays were spent back in Ayrshire. Elizabeth's interest lay in documenting and discovering fossils and she trained her children to document their findings too. Robert co-founded the Natural History Society of Glasgow where much of their findings were exhibited. It was traditional that men took the lead and Mrs Robert Gray was a name she used. Robert would present and take credit for his family's work. At the time you needed to publish papers to join learned societies. Elizabeth's specimens were frequently used at the start of meetings of the Natural History Society of Glasgow but with poor attribution that implied that her husband or she were possibly those responsible. However, in 1866 the first Gray collection was given to the Hunterian Museum in Glasgow by the two of them. The curator of the Hunterian Museum was John Young who was the Regius Professor of Natural History at the University of Glasgow and a strong supporter for women's higher education. He ran classes for women and in 1869 he invited Elizabeth to attend lectures in geology at his university. Her finds and their scientific descriptions became type specimens. Many of her finds are type specimens; the mollusc Lophospira trispiralis, the starfish Hudsonaster grayae and the echinoderm Archophiactis grayae are all defined by fossils she found. From 1874 they were able to use the expertise of the palaeontologists of Edinburgh as the family moved to follow Robert's new job. The Ordovician fossils were described and classified. Robert died in 1887. Further collaboration Elizabeth Gray's work was drawn upon by many publications, such as Charles Lapworth's Girvan Succession of 1882. Lapworth noted her work's significance as \\"the very first collection in which the exact localities and horizons of every individual fossil...[were] written down at the time of collection.\\" Elizabeth was offered the chance to learn how to scientifically describe her own finds by Doctor Ramsay Traquair of the Royal Scottish Museum, but she wanted to concentrate on finding specimens for others to study as she felt that others had more experience. The palaeontologist Thomas Davidson benefited from Gray's lack of interest and he described collections of fossils that Gray sent to him between 1857 and 1885. In 1878‚Äì1880, R. Etheridge and H. Alleyne Nicholson published a Monograph of the Silurian Fossils of the Girvan District in Ayrshire using Gray's collection. When Nicholson's funding ran out so did his interest and Gray turned to F.R.Cowper Reed of Cambridge for assistance. He was thought of as a recluse but he was able to publish several papers based on Gray's fossils and it is thought that he never visited the site to see where they had been collected. William Kingdon Spencer worked on her fossils as did Jane Longstaff who sorted out the fossil gastropods. Gray was constantly organising and begging for assistance to ensure that her finds were described correctly and to this end she had a long and at times impatient correspondence with Francis Bather at the British Museum. In 1900 Gray was made an honorary member of the Geological Society of Glasgow, and in 1903, aged 72, Gray was awarded the Murchison geological fund in recognition of her lifelong contributions to the field. The ODNB notes that Gray was \\"a woman of considerable character, determination, and resourcefulness, with a phenomenally retentive memory.\\" Gray continued gathering fossils until the age of 92, and died in Edinburgh in 1924. After her death, her work was continued by her daughters, Alice and Edith. Legacy Gray has left extensive collections of Scottish fossils in a number of British museums. She and her family worked in Girvan from 1855 to 1941. The family created scientifically organised collections of fossils for several museums including the Natural History Museum. Alice, assisted by Edith, continued to visit Girvan until 1941. Alice described it as the recreation of her childhood.

Origins  At the Eighth International Genetics Congress in 1948 eminent geneticists Douglas Falconer, R.A.Fisher, Salome Gluecksohn- Waelsch, Hans Gr√ºneberg and Paula Hertwig agreed that investigators working on mouse genetics and development needed a regular information bulletin. Hence, the first issue of Mouse News Letter edited by L.C.Dunn and Salome Gluecksohn- Waelsch was published in June 1949.Searle AG. (1974). ‚ÄúThe origins of Mouse News Letter‚Äù.

Toby Carter, who had been one of R.A. Fisher's students, took over as editor until 1956. The Mouse News Letter logo, a circular mouse emblem, first appeared on the cover of the third issue reaching its final form in Mouse News Letter number 4.  Mouse News Letter as an informal bulletin  Although Mouse News Letter became more sophisticated over the years, many of the basic elements seen in the first issues were retained throughout. These included lists and maps of mouse genes and mutants, information on inbred strains, and brief reports of useful results that did not merit a full paper. The first gene list appeared in 1951, containing only 125 genes. The first linkage map, comprising 15 ‚Äúlinkage groups‚Äù with 58 loci was published in MNL in 1953. The database underlying the linkage map was maintained for many years by Margaret GreenGreen, MC (1966). ‚ÄúMutant genes and linkages‚Äù, pp. 87-150 in Biology of the Laboratory Mouse, Second Edition, edited by E.

MNL was issued twice a year and was free until 1972 when subscription fees were introduced. Lists of inbred strains appeared from very early days but between 1958 and 1984 were issued as a separate entity ‚ÄúInbred Strains of Mice‚Äù every two years as a supplement. MNL was edited by Mary Lyon from 1956-1972 and then by Tony Searle until 1982. In 1986, during Jo Peters‚Äô time as editor, MNL became a formal publication of genetic information published by Oxford University Press. Then, for the first time, contributions could be quoted without seeking permission from the author. The Nomenclature Committee formed the Editorial Board. The number of issues per year increased from two to three with the third one being an ‚ÄúInbred Strains‚Äù issue edited by Michael Festing. This replaced Inbred Strains of Mice. The journal was run by a company Mouse News Letter Ltd, limited by guarantee and with charitable status. Over the years, with the inexorable increase in genetic information, MNL also grew and the size and variety of lists and maps published increased greatly. In keeping with the then new field of recombinant DNA work, lists of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) and probes and clones were included.Elliott, RW.

Mouse Genome and Mammalian Genome  In February 1990 Mouse News Letter changed its name to Mouse Genome. In addition to the lists, maps and unrefereed contributions, short refereed papers were published. Starting in 1991 Mouse Genome was published four times a year as one volume with four issues. As before, each issue had a theme and contained contributions and short papers. The first issue of the year was a ‚ÄúMaps‚Äù issue, the second issue was a ‚ÄúGenes‚Äú issue, the third issue was ‚ÄúInbred Strains‚Äù and the fourth issue was a DNA probes and Restriction fragment length polymorphism issue. During the 1990s it became clear with the exponential increase in knowledge that the long-term future of mouse genetics information was an electronic one. In 1998 Mouse Genome, the official journal of the International Committee for Standardized Genetic Nomenclature for Mice, merged with Mammalian Genome the official journal of the International Mammalian Genome Society.Silver, LM; Nadeau, JH; Brown, SDM; Eppig, JT; Peters, J.

'Placing on the market' means the supply of timber or timber products for the first time on the internal market (Article 2(b)). A 'trader' is any natural or legal person who, in the course of a commercial activity, sells or buys on the internal market timber or timber products already placed on the internal market (Article 2(d)).http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32010R0995 The regulation is an outcome of the EU's FLEGT (Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade) Action Plan, which aims to reduce illegal logging worldwide. The Action Plan recognised the possibility of developing new legislation to address the demand side of illegal logging. This resulted in the adoption of the EUTR in December 2010. The EUTR entered into force on 3 March 2013. It is directly applicable in all EU member states. In February 2016, the European Commission published an updated version of the Guidance Document for the EU Timber Regulation.Guidance Document for the EU Timber Regulation http://ec.europa.eu/environment/forests/pdf/eutr_guidance.zip Scope The EUTR covers a range of timber products such as solid wood products, flooring, plywood, pulp and paper that are listed the EUTR‚Äôs Annex.Regulation (EU) No 995/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council. http://eur- lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32010R0995 The EUTR does not cover recycled products, as well as printed papers such as books, magazines and newspapers. The product scope can however be amended. The EUTR applies to both imported and domestically produced timber and timber products. Timber and timber products covered by valid FLEGT or CITES licences automatically meet the requirements of the EUTR. Obligations The EUTR prohibits the placing onto the EU market of illegally harvested timber and timber products derived from such timber. It requires operators who place timber or timber products on the market for the first time to exercise due diligence to make sure that timber and timber products are legal. To facilitate the traceability of timber and timber products, the EUTR also requires traders who buy or sell timber products on the EU market to keep records of their suppliers and customers. The due diligence system shall contain the following three elements:European Commission. EU Timber Regulation http://ec.europa.eu/environment/forests/timber_regulation.htmEuropean Commission. Basic minimum description of a DDS (due diligence system) http://ec.europa.eu/environment/forests/pdf/Basic%20minimum%20description%20of%20a%20DDS.pdf # Information: Operators shall provide the following information: a description of the timber or timber products placed on the market (including trade name and type of product, common name of tree species and, if applicable, their scientific name), country of harvest, quantity, details of the supplier and information on compliance with applicable legislation. # Risk assessment: Operators should analyse and evaluate the risk of illegally harvested timber or timber products placed on the market, based on the information identified above and taking into account relevant risk assessment criteria set out in the EUTR, including but not limited to, assurance of compliance with applicable legislation, prevalence of illegal harvesting of specific tree species, prevalence of illegal harvesting or practices in the sourcing country, complexity of the supply chain. # Risk mitigation: When the assessment has demonstrated that there is a risk of illegally harvested timber or timber products derived from such timber, operators shall mitigate such risk by requiring additional information and/or verification by a third party.Detailed rules concerning the due diligence system are laid down in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 607/2012 of 6 July 2012 on the detailed rules concerning the due diligence system and the frequency and nature of the checks on monitoring organisations as provided for in Regulation (EU) no 995/2010, http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32012R0607. Operators can set up due diligence systems on an individual basis or with the assistance of monitoring organisations (Article 8). Monitoring organisations are legal entities recognised by the European Commission, as fulfilling the EUTR requirements, competent to assist operators in meeting the EUTR due diligence obligations.Procedural rules on the recognition (and withdrawal) of monitoring organisations are laid down in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 363/2012 of 23 February 2012 on the procedural rules for the recognition and withdrawal of recognition of monitoring organisations as provided for in Regulation (EU) No 995/2010, http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32012R0363. Implementation  The Regulation is legally binding on all 28 EU Member States. The EUTR requires all EU member states to implement the Regulation by designating a ‚Äòcompetent authority‚Äô responsible for its application (Article 7), lay down ‚Äúeffective, proportionate and dissuasive‚Äù penalties applicable to infringements of the EUTR and take all measures necessary to guarantee that penalties are enforced (Article 19).Regulation (EU) No 995/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council. http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32010R0995 Review  In 2015, the European Commission undertook a review of the EUTR, in compliance with a legal obligation laid down in Article 20(3) of the Regulation. The purpose of the review is to assess the functioning and effectiveness of the EUTR, including in preventing illegally harvested timber or timber products derived from such timber being placed on the market. More than 240 stakeholders, NGOs and the private sector contributed to a public consultation as part of the review process.

Early years (1851‚Äì89) Georges Marie Denis Gabriel Trouillot was born on 7 May 1851 in Champagnole, Jura. He studied classics at the Jesuit college in Dole, then studied law in Lyon. He became an attorney in Lons-le-Saunier. On 2 August 1870 he was appointed sub-lieutenant in the National Mobile Guard of the Jura department. He was one of the founders of the Jura Republican Union. He was a member of the general council of Jura for the canton of Beaufort, then municipal councilor in 1877. He was elected mayor of Lons-le-Saunier. In 1889 he was named president of the Bar. National politics (1889‚Äì1916)=Deputy Trouillot ran in the general election of 1889, and was elected in the first round for the constituency of Lons-le-Saunier. He joined the Union of Progressives and Radical Left in the chamber. He was also elected president of the Jura departmental assembly. He was reelected deputy in 1893 and in 1898. In 1891 Trouillot proposed a law against abortion and contraception. Discussion was long delayed, and the proposal was not passed by the Senate until January 1919. Trouillot introduced a bill to let anyone who held the degree of licence en droit practice as an avocat, removing the authority of the Order of Advocates to approve new members of their profession. In response, the Paris Order struck him off their register. The case went to court and Trouillot was reinstated on the basis that the disbarment hearings had not followed due process. The decision caused outrage among the leading advocates. Trouillot assisted Ren√© Viviani in introduction of the law of 1 December 1900 that allowed women to practice as advocates following a campaign by Jeanne Chauvin, who became the second woman to be admitted to the profession. Minister of Colonies The public scandal of the Dreyfus Affair blew up in January 1898 with √âmile Zola's publication in L'Aurore of his open letter entitled J'Accuse‚Ä¶!. Trouillot accused the premier Jules M√©line of practicing the politics of division. M√©line resigned during the debate of 14 June 1898. Trouillot was appointed to the new Radical government formed late that month. He was Minister of the Colonies in the second cabinet of Henri Brisson, and held office from 28 June 1898 to 26 October 1898. Trouillot saw little value in the French enclaves in India, and told the Foreign Minister that he would be willing to give them all to the British in exchange for the Gambia. The Polynesian island of Mangareva was more important to him than the French possessions in India. His views were not shared by the inhabitants of Mah√©, who said it was capable of \\"rivaling in salubriousness with the best of sanatoriums of the Presidency of Madras.\\" This was a time of rapid colonial expansion in Africa, where officers were given much freedom of action as long as they succeeded in acquiring territory. Trouillot said in a speech in 1898, \\"Let us give ourselves a birth incentive so that we can once again become the world's foremost colonizing people.\\" In a decree of 7 August 1898 Trouillot created an office of financial control for French West Africa under the direction of the governor-general. This gave the colonialist a significant increase in independence from the metropolitan government. In July Trouillot wrote to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Th√©ophile Delcass√©, that Major Jean-Baptiste Marchand was approaching Fashoda on the Nile, and the British general Herbert Kitchener would soon also arrive there. Delcass√© did not reply until September, when he said Marchand should return before reaching Fashoda. By that time it was too late to prevent the encounter, so the letter was mainly so that the French could disavow Marchand if things went wrong, as it did in the Fashoda Incident. Law of Associations Trouillot played a central role in developing the Law of Associations. He was rapporteur for all the parliamentary debates on this law, working closely with the head of government, Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau. The law defined the legal status of associations such as mutual societies and agricultural cooperatives, and was developed through study of associations in the Jura, elsewhere in Europe and in the United States. According to Trouillot, hostility to religious congregations had always been the reason why efforts to allow freedom of association had failed in the past, Trouillot's answer was to curb the powers of associations to prevent abuse. The law required almost all the religious orders and congregations in France to obtain legal authorization from parliament, and disallowed any member of an unauthorized order or congregation from teaching or managing a school. The Law of Associations was passed in July 1901. The church complained that the law resulted in a cascade of closures of schools and ecclesiastical establishments. Other activities Trouillot was Minister of Industry, Commerce and Posts from 7 June 1902 to 18 January 1905 in the cabinet of √âmile Combes. Trouillot, who was known for his anti- clericalism, followed a traditional policy in dealing with industrial issues. In March 1904 his predecessor Alexandre Millerand complained that his social program had been replaced by a program of \\"monk-hunting\\". However, during a strike of textile workers in the fall of 1903 Trouillot agreed in substance with the strikers' complaints against the manufacturers, and the Chamber voted almost unanimously for arbitration to resume, and for a thorough inquiry into the textile industry. Trouillot was again Minister of Industry, Commerce and Posts from 12 November 1905 to 9 March 1906 in the second cabinet of Maurice Rouvier. Trouillot was elected Senator for the Jura on 7 January 1906. He was again Minister of the Colonies from 24 July 1909 to 2 November 1910 in the cabinet of Aristide Briand. On 31 May 1910 he decreed that the administrators of French Equatorial Africa had the power to adjudicate offenses committed by the indigenous people that could not be tried by the French courts. Through his influence, most young men in the Jura were posted to the nearby garrisons at Lons-le-Saunier and Bourg for their military service. An unplanned consequence was that at the outbreak of World War I (1914‚Äì18) the department suffered disproportionate losses. Trouillot's canton of Beaufort suffered particularly large losses. Georges Trouillot died in Paris on 20 November 1916. His daughter married the future colonial administrator Lucien Saint. Publications Trouillot was a distinguished man of letters, and published several books. These included Du contrat d'association (1902) and Pour l'id√©e la√Øque (1906). He also contributed to several journals, notably Voltaire and Le Si√®cle.

He teaches theater at NYU's Tisch School of Arts and is a member of the Playwrights Unit at Goodman Theatre in Chicago. He also has had work commissioned by Yale Repertory Theatre. Pe√±a is the co-writer of the Golden Globe nominated TV series, Jane the Virgin and was on the \\"Future Broadway Power List,\\" by Backstage (magazine) in 2014.  Personal life = Early life  Christopher Oscar Pe√±a is the first of his family to be born within the borders of the United States (San Jose, CA ). His parents emigrated from Honduras and entered the U.S. before he was born. Although he does not remember, Pe√±a's parents have told him that his first career choice as a child was to be a writer. He would be found reading a book at the mall's bookstore when he wondered off as a child. A self-proclaimed nerd, Pe√±a identified his participation, his freshman year, in his high school's production of Romeo and Juliet as his first time falling in love with theatre as \\"people were forced to interact with [him] and the social boundaries fell apart.\\" He felt both vulnerable and safe at the same time and decided he would continue theatre and acting at the University of California Santa Barbara.  Academics  Pe√±a received his B.A. in Dramatic Arts from the University of California Santa Barbara and his M.F.A. in Dramatic Writing from the Tisch School of the Arts at NYU. When he first got to UC Santa Barbara he pursued acting but quickly realized that it was not his strength. He switched his major to sociology, thinking of pursuing a career in law, and was going to give up on theatre in general. He then got introduced into playwriting by a professor named Naomi Iizuka. She told him \\"'You're a playwright. You tell Stories.'\\" When he heard those words, he quickly enrolled in her writing course. In her writing course he was not exposed to the classics and Shakespearean plays that are common of writing courses, but instead to emerging playwrights and peers of his professor. He credits the exposure to new and up and coming playwrights as a something that \\"sparked [his] theatrical imagination.\\"  Career  As a playwright, Pe√±a has produced a large number of plays, some of which have been produced all over the United States and in the UK. Pe√±a's plays include Maelstrom, Icarus Burns, Alone Above A Raging Sea, L(y)re, The Suicide Tapes and Awe/Struck. His work has been developed or seen in theaters in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles such as: The Public Theater, INTAR Theatre, LAByrinth Theater Company, Goodman Theatre, Theater for the New City, Son of Semele Theater and more. As part of the T.S. Eliot US/UK Exchange in 2011, Pe√±a attended the premiere of his play However Long The Night at The Old Vic. In 2013, Pe√±a's play Tiny People (or, it gets better) was a finalist for both the O'Neill Playwrights Conference and the Sundance Theatre Lab, and was selected to feature at the Crossing Borders Festival. His play, A Cautionary Tail premiered at The Flea Theater where every performance sold out and the production was extended twice. In 2014, he co-produced his first play in Chicago, with Melissa Lusk called I Wonder If Its Possible For a Love Affair To Last Forever? Or Things I Found On Craigslist, which premiered at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Pe√±a is a recipient of the Norman Corwin Award for excellence in audio theatre. As a screenwriter, Pe√±a created and is the co-star of the web series 80/20, which focuses on viewing sexuality as a spectrum. 80/20 was selected for the 2013 New Media Film Festival and the 2015 Outfest Web Series: In With The New Out. The web series also won the 2013 LAWEBFEST Outstanding Achievement writing award. Pe√±a is a writer for the Golden Globe nominated TV show, Jane the Virgin on The CW. Pe√±a's works frequently focus on stories that deal with bicultural identities, sexuality, and growing up in the modern world. A Latino himself, Pe√±a works closely with culturally diverse theaters like The Lark Playwright Workshop, US/UK Exchange, INTAR'S Hispanic Playwrights Lab, Diverse City Theater Company and New York Theatre Workshop, where he was named an Emerging Artist of Color Fellow. Through these relationships, he works to represent a variety of cultural and sexual populations in theater. In 2012, Pe√±a performed at the INTAR Producing Latino Voices in English Festival; while In 2009, he won the Latino Playwrights Award from The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts for his work, Maelstrom. Pe√±a's work is published by NoPassport Press and Smith and Kraus.  View of Theatre  Pe√±a writes to understand the many issues he grapples with in everyday life. He believes a play should make the audience both feel surprised and think of the world from a new perspective. One play that stood out to him was Angels in America due to its use of metaphors. This was different from the realistic plays that he had read earlier and it made him realize that realism was the not the only form of theatre. Christopher Oscar Pe√±a composes many of his plays with Asian characters because of his experience growing up around Vietnamese people in the Bay Area. To him, \\"Asian-Americans are a part of [his] cultural identity\\" and therefore should be a part of his work. He doesn't believe that Latinx playwrights should be forced to write plays about \\"immigration, drug cartels, and the working class\\" because not every Latinx individual shares those experiences. He's, thus, faced questions about what makes a play \\"Latinx\\" and has had a hard time at some theatre putting on his plays. Pe√±a believes that individuals should write about stories that are true to themselves and their cultural identities and will continue to this in his work. According to Pe√±a, unlike other playwrights, he writes no more than 3‚Äì4 days a week. To him, writing everyday is not useful and he instead uses the other days to get inspiration from his everyday activities. He uses these experiences as \\"research\\" for his plays. Pe√±a also does not take notes in order to write his plays but instead thinks of writing as a bucket of water; it continues to fill with water as he interacts more with his environment and experiences different things daily and when it's full, it spills and that is when he begins to write. He's written plays over the course of 4‚Äì6 days this way: \\"When the writing comes it comes.\\" He sees the fact that you can be vulnerable for people like an actor but avoid being in front of them on stage; which is what he loves.  Notable plays = A Cautionary Tale  The play follows two Chinese-American siblings who are academically very successful at their high school and all about work and no play due to the strong presence of their Chinese mother in their lives. The Chinese mother expects perfection from her children and denounces their actions when they try and act like their American friends. Aside from clashes between American culture and Chinese culture, the play also tackles issues of race (the daughter is dating someone who is African-American) and sexuality (the son is gay). Pe√±a was glad to see the play put on by The Flea and has said the actors represent both \\"New York, [and] what America looks like to [him].\\" The play has been positively reviewed by many critics.  Awe/Struck  \\"Denia arrives in Chicago, looking to create a place for herself in this unfamiliar land. Monique‚Äôs never left Chicago but feels more and more like a stranger in her own home. A chance encounter between them transforms their lives forever in this new play about identity and perception.\\" Pe√±a has said that the inspiration for this play came from a terrible incident he saw in a newspaper one day. He has not clarified on the event. Reading about the event made him think about \\"What [it] means to be a good neighbor\\" and \\"how we can be good neighbors\\" in our local neighborhoods but also as countries that are next to each other. He has acknowledged, after the fact, that his personal loneliness from moving to Chicago, where he didn't know anyone, and his own questioning of what makes somewhere home, influenced the play and the development of his characters.  Icarus Burns  Pe√±a states that this play is his response to the 2008 election, when former President Barack Obama took office, and California passed Proposition 8. This sparked questions, for him, of \\"what it means to be a person of color in the United States\\". The play takes place during the environment of the 2008 election where the political rhetoric of \\"hope and change [is] giving rise to dreams.\\" The play focuses on the lives of six individuals who, because of this rhetoric, are hoping to go after their dreams but face obstacles that make it harder for them survive as part of marginalized communities. Key themes the play touches on are immigration, same-sex marriage, and domestic abuse.

Signed to Mushroom Records and managed by Stuart Coupe, the Chosen Few released four singles and a lone album Friends, Foes and Firewood (1990). Despite constant national touring (including opening for major touring acts like Jerry Harrison, Cheap Trick and Billy Joel on their respective Australian tours) and receiving support from the country's most influential radio stations; chart success eluded the Chosen Few with only a cover version of the band's song 'Rise' becoming a hit for popular Australian singer Daryl Braithwaite. Braithwaite's version of 'Rise' is also the title track of his successful 1990 album, and remains a staple on Australian commercial radio. Biography The Chosen Few was formed in 1985 in Sydney, Australia with Danny McCarthy (Guitar & Vocals), Abe Elshaikh (Guitar & Vocals), Paul Read (Bass) & Rex Mansfield (Drums). After numerous months rehearsing, writing and cutting demos, the band was taken up by rock writer and manager Stuart Coupe (who at the time was enjoying the commercial heights with his artist Paul Kelly) and signed to Mushroom Records in 1988. The band's debut single 'Get It Right' (November, 1988) was met with enthusiasm in the Australian rock music media and the band's following single 'Rise' (April, 1989) was critically praised and reached # 35 on the ARIA charts. However, the band's commercial prospects didn't appear promising when the band's third single 'Love' (November, 1989) failed to chart. The band's debut album Friends, Foes and Firewood was released in 1990 and went triple platinum in sales, and reached No.1 on the Rolling Stone Album Chart. After six years and 261 shows, The Chosen Few did their final four concerts at the Sydney Entertainment Centre as the opening act on Billy Joel's Storm Front tour. In 1994, The Chosen Few (without Elsheik) re-emerged as The Dreamseed with addition of guitarist Steve Barnes and Darren Bulmer, and relocated to Germany.

Legend As per Hindu legend, during the divine wedding of Shiva and Parvathi, there was heavy crowd at Kailash, the abode of Shiva. Sage Agasthya could not view event and prayed to Shiva at this place to get him a view of the event. Shiva told him that he would offer darshan in Kutralam itself. Dvarapalas, the gateway deities did not allow entry to Agasthya, which was originally a Vishnu temple. With his powers, he changed Vishnu to Shiva, conch to deer and Tulsi to crescent moon and pressed the head of Vishnu until it became a lingam, the iconic form of Shiva. On account of the heavy pressing, Shiva got a headache and it is believed that in modern times, the image of the presiding deity carries the hand marks of the sage. To alleviate the headache of Shiva, the sage prepared an oil with cow milk, green coconut and mixture of 42 herbs and applied it to Shiva. Pleased by his devotion, Shiva made the place his abode and came to be called Kutralanathar and the falls nearby the temple got the name of Coutrallam as Coutrallam Falls. The tradition is followed in the Kutralanathar Temple in modern times as well. Geography thumb Coutrallam Falls is located in Western Ghats to the South of Coutrallam town and to the north of Coutrallam Lower, the first lake in the descent of Chittar. It is located from the nearest town Tenkasi and from the nearest city Tirunelveli. The place is frequented by animals like Tiger and Panther, which are frequently spotted in the route from Coutrallam Falls to Papansam as both are located close to Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve. There are a total of nine falls namely, Peraruvi (Main Falls), Aintharuvi (Five Falls), Shenbaga Devi Aruvi, Thenaruvi (Honey Falls), Chitraruvi, Puli Aruvi (Tiger Falls), Pazhaya Aruvi (Old Falls), Puthu Aruvi (New Falls) and Pazhathotta Aruvi (Fruit Garden Falls), each of which is located within radius. The falls receives its waters during the South-west monsoon from May to September, but the maximum amount of rainfall is received during the North-east monsoon during October to December. The Kutralanathar Temple is located close to the main falls. Culture The Boat House in the Falls The Tenkasi district administration organises Saral Vizha every year during the Tamil month of Aadi (July - August). The falls is usually frequented by devotees of the Papanasanathar Temple, who take a holy dip in the falls before visiting the temple. The falls is also frequented by tourists to Sabarimala during the November - December season in a religious circuit in the region and Agasthiyar Falls. Various competitions like Swimming, pedal boating, row boating and debating are organised during the festival. There are also flower exhibits from Ooty and Kodaikanal, light music shows, dog show and dance performance. The Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation (TTDC) has a boat house that operates boating during season.

United Nations forces depended upon improvised U.S. forward air control systems. The United States military held two competing doctrines for directing close air support (CAS). The U.S. Marine Corps' system depended on an organic supporting air wing delivering ordnance within 1,000 yards of front-line troops; this was to compensate for their weakness in artillery caused by being an amphibious force. On the other hand, the U.S. Army believed close air support should extend the range of its own organic artillery; it also wanted its own air corps. However, the U.S. Air Force was tasked with supplying trained fighter pilots as forward air controllers (FACs), with the Army supplying equipment and personnel. As events fell out, the 1st Marine Air Wing supplied the FACs and air strikes for X Corps during the war, while 5th Air Force supplied FACs and strike support to 8th Army. There were awkward attempts at coordination between the two, and with carrier-borne air power, though with limited success. Tactical air power, including CAS, was largely instrumental in staunching communist offensives as the opposing forces swept back and forth in mobile warfare. (See graphic below.) Notable from the beginning was the reinvention of the airborne FAC; the T-6 \\"Mosquitos\\" of the 6147th Tactical Control Group would fly 40,354 FAC sorties, be credited with killing 184,808 communist troops, and win two U.S. and one Korean Presidential Unit Citations. Though only United Nations air superiority from the earliest days of the war made \\"Mosquito\\" operations possible, other FACs also inflicted serious casualties on the communists. However, forward air control techniques paid off in diminishing returns once the opposing sides settled into trench warfare. As both sides dug in √† la World War I, the communists operated at night to avoid air attacks. The U.S. Air Force FAC effort experimented with Shoran-directed raids and radar-directed bombing as a counter to this. Even as the FAC systems served crucial roles in combat, the turf war concerning doctrine continued unabated. There were at least eight attempts to alter the Army/Air Force FAC system during the Korean War, with no substantive result. At war's end, forward air control policies in the U.S. military remained unchanged from those at its start. By 1956, the Army/Air Force CAS system was defunct. Overview The U.S. military codified their forward air control (FAC) experience from World War II in 1946, when the most recent edition of Field Manual 31‚Äì35 Air Ground Operations (FM 31‚Äì35) was issued for the U.S. Army. The Army Air Force organized its strategic bombers into the Strategic Air Command (SAC), and split its fighters into Air Defense Command (ADC), and Tactical Air Command (TAC). The latter was tasked with close air support (CAS), and thus with forward air control. The Air Force's doctrine, based on Second World War experience called for three necessary conditions for successful close air support. One was gaining air superiority over the enemy. Another was isolating the battlefield via interdiction strikes on a foe's lines of communication. The third was the delivery of air strikes via a forward air control system supporting the Army's ground forces. The Army tended to believe the latter was given the lowest priority by the Air Force and resented it. In 1947, the newly established U.S. Air Force also adopted FM 31‚Äì35. However, this failed to set a single forward air control system within the U.S. military. As part of the division of forces when the Air Force became independent, the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps kept their aviation components and their forward control systems. The Army kept its light liaison aircraft and the few helicopters of the era, but was still dependent on the Air Force for most air support, including forward air control.Gooderson, p. 26. Background Two different forward air control systems had emerged during World War II. The U.S. Army and its Air Corps had developed one system in the North African Campaign; the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps developed a different system in the Pacific Theater. The U.S. Army fought a conventional land war in North Africa, using its tactical air power to strike beyond the range of its artillery. The U.S. Marine fought an amphibious war as light infantry supported by little artillery fire; consequently, they directed air strikes on targets within 1,000 yards of their own forces.Futrell, pp. 704‚Äì705. The newly independent Air Force concentrated on possible future nuclear warfare. In November 1948, Tactical Air Command was eliminated as a separate command within the Air Force. Much of the fledgling Air Force's energies were caught up in turf wars with other branches of the U.S. military. The U.S. Army was angling for its own organic air power within its ranks, √† la the U.S. Marines. When the U.S. Navy and Marines pointed out the utility of air strikes landing as close as artillery fire to protect friendly troops, the Air Force countered that the Marines had to use air strikes because they lacked artillery in amphibious assaults. The Air Force pledged trained fighter pilots as forward air controllers (FACs) to direct a joint CAS operation; the Army was tasked with supplying radio equipment, vehicles, and personnel for these Tactical Air Control Parties (TACP). This led to another point of disagreement. The Army claimed it should have input into the types of aircraft used in close air support strikes, and plumped for propeller-driven planes; the Air Force claimed the right to develop its weaponry unimpeded, and intended to develop jets into CAS aircraft.Schlight, pp. 71‚Äì105. During the late 1940s, the U.S. military tested its forward air control capabilities per FM 31‚Äì35 during several joint field maneuvers involving the Army and Air Force. During the maneuvers, radios used for coordinating air action were unreliable; radio nets were overwhelmed with traffic. When the controllers could be contacted, they often had no targets to offer. When they did, they struggled to handle more than a single flight at a time. The early jet aircraft used for close air support had a voracious appetite for fuel, a short radii of action, and a short linger time over target. The joint Army/Air Force FAC effort results compared poorly to the U.S. Marines' organic system; it obviously needed drastic improvement.Schlight, pp. 99, 106‚Äì107. Korea was an unpromising venue for an air campaign. A peninsula about a third larger than Florida, its terrain was characterized by a web of monotonous blue-green mountains interlaced with numerous valleys and ravines. The highest peaks formed a rugged spine that would divide military campaigns into coastal movements on either side of the mountains. Forward air controllers, with so many similar terrain features to observe, would find themselves tricked into errors of identification. To complicate matters, unreliable maps available bore widespread mistakes and confusions in town names, and portrayed terrain features as far as 1,000 meters out of true.Futrell, pp. 62‚Äì66, 214. During World War II, the Japanese had built ten airstrips in South Korea, but only two could handle modern aircraft. Korean meteorology was also inimical to easy air operations. Because the weather fronts moved southward over North Korea into the war zone, the communists had the advantage of a figurative weather gage for their military planning. The shooting war=Retreat to the Pusan perimeter When North Korea invaded South Korea on 25 June 1950 to begin the Korean War, the only air control system in Korea was tasked to direct air to air combat. There were no forward air control units in Korea. The U.S. Air Force's only Tactical Air Control Group was in the U.S. So was the U.S. Army's 20th Signal Company, which was the only American unit capable of running an air communications network. thumbleftTerritory often changed hands early in the war, until the front stabilized. Nevertheless, two Air Force Tactical Air Control Parties arrived in theater within the war's first week. Over 60% of the air strikes flown in the first month of the war‚Äîsome 3,251 sorties‚Äîbeefed up the scanty artillery support of American and South Korean ground forces. American communication nets in Korea were so overloaded that close air support operations were hindered. At times, senior officers even desperately resorted to personal telephone calls to Japan to request air strikes. Without guidance, many tactical sorties became a hunt for targets of opportunity. Even B-29 Superfortresses were pressed into close air support, though with little effect.Schlight, pp. 120‚Äì122. General Partridge's solution for channeling air strike requests was to send SC-399 radios with operators to every Air Liaison Officer at an Army divisional headquarters, improvising an ad hoc air communications net that would eventually develop into the 6147th Tactical Control Group (6147th TCG) of airborne FACs. He also established a Joint Operations Center (JOC) on 5 July 1950, per doctrine. Meanwhile, on 14 July, the 6132d Tactical Air Control Group (Provisional) was formed as a ground FAC unit. On 23 July, it established a bare-bones Tactical Air Control Center without radar; it served as a radio net for the JOC, under the call sign \\"Mellow Control\\". It also assumed control of all TACPs in country. Liaison was established with the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing; any air strikes \\"excess\\" to support of marine ground units also were directed through \\"Mellow Control\\". In a cumbersome makeshift, naval aviation strikes had to be coordinated through U.S. Navy headquarters in Japan.Futrell, pp. 104‚Äì109, 121.Schlight, pp. 142‚Äì146. Despite being jury-rigged, the air control system played a great role in staving off American defeat in the first few months of the war. General William F. Dean said it was crucial in standing off the North Korean attacks. General William B. Kean told journalists after one hard-fought battle where his forces were supported by 108 sorties of tactical air, \\"The close air support strikes by the Fifth Air Force again saved this (25th) Division, as they have done many times before.\\"Futrell, p. 142. General Walton Walker fervently agreed.Schlight, p. 122.Futrell, pp. 148‚Äì152. On 17, 19, and 20 July 1950, forward air controllers directed 5th Air Force fighter pilots in successful aerial interceptions that destroyed some of the last usable Yakovlev Yak-9s of the North Korean Air Force. With the North Korean air threat then roundly defeated, the United Nations established the superiority necessary for ongoing successful forward air control and close air support efforts.Futrell, pp. 98‚Äì102. During 1950, the 6147th Tactical Control Group operated as far as 50 miles into enemy territory, using relay aircraft to remain in radio contact. =Return of the airborne FAC= Airborne forward air controllers merited a single dismissive sentence in FM 31‚Äì35.Schlight, p. 151. Nevertheless, two weeks into the war, Lieutenant Colonel Stanley P. Latiolas, operations officer of the Fifth Air Force, suggested having a slower airplane spot targets for the fuel-hog jets. Colonel John R. Murphy, familiar with the Horsefly FACs of World War II, asked General Earle E. Partridge for five pilots to fly reconnaissance. On 9 July 1950, Lieutenants James A. Bryant and Frank G. Mitchell flew the first airborne FAC missions of the Korean War from K-5 Taejon Air Base. They flew into K-5 with two Stinson L-5 Sentinels modified with needed VHF radios‚Äîwhich promptly became inoperable. Borrowing two 24th Division L-17 Navions, the lieutenants contacted surprised fighter pilots and directed about 10 flights of F-80s in air strikes.Futrell, p. 78. The advent of airborne FACs was a timely one. The other four TACPs of the 620th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron had joined its original two parties in ground forward air control as the U.S. military scrambled to form TACPs. Their utility was limited because the FAC had to remain with his MRC108 radio jeep while ordering air strikes, making a very visible target for enemy shellfire. The radios were fragile, and they were easily damaged by jolting and vibration. By 11 July 1950, only three of the radio jeeps were still working.Futrell, p. 80. LT-6Gs of the 6147th TCG used for forward air control in Korea. The following day saw the first use of a T-6 Texan for a FAC aircraft, as the original FACs flew a sortie directing air strikes by Lockheed P-80 Shooting Stars that knocked out 17 North Korean tanks near Chonui. During the direction of Royal Australian Air Force P-51 Mustangs, the T-6 radio became unserviceable. The FAC continued indicating targets by flying over them and rocking his wings. The resulting strikes were the first of many successful attacks made without radio contact, as United Nations bombers operated on many non-compatible radio frequencies. The T-6 became the standard FAC aircraft for Korean use, although others were considered. Although the T-6 entered the FAC role as a \\"hot\\" aircraft, it was soon encumbered with numerous adaptations that degraded its performance. With a load that included a long-range belly tank, smoke grenades, and a dozen smoke rockets added under each wing for marking targets adding half a ton of added weight, the T-6 was limited to a top speed of , and its service ceiling was considerably reduced. The T-6's low wing restricted view and its lowered performance was a detriment to its role in forward air control. The 6147th tested the L-19, later known as the O-1 Bird Dog. However, it offered no better performance than the Texan and its lack of armor left it vulnerable to ground fire. There was also an abortive attempt to use the L-17 Navion as a FAC aircraft. The Navion's low wing design precluded much success in observation.Dorr, Thompson, p. 22. However, the T-6s did not go unscathed, as 20 were lost in action by December 1950.Lester, p. 59. Several of the smaller, slower liaison planes were shot down by North Korean Yaks‚Äîincluding 6 Navion L-17s‚Äîand they were withdrawn from action. Fifth Air Force also turned to higher performance aircraft for the FAC mission. P-51 Mustangs and F4U Corsairs were used to penetrate enemy air space after it had become too hazardous for T-6s. From Inchon to the Yalu River General Edward Almond used the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing and naval aviation from supporting aircraft carriers to provide close air support for his X Corps landing at Inchon in September 1950. His air campaign was managed through the U.S. Navy's Combat Information Center, which coordinated with the 5th Air Force's Joint Operations Center. All nine battalions of the 1st Marine Division had a Marine FAC attached to headquarters. Fifth Air Force had done the same for the battalions of the U.S. Army's Seventh Division.Futrell, p. 159. Despite the difficult tide and port conditions, the landing succeeded with support of naval tactical air. With United Nations ground forces both before and behind the North Korean Army, the latter fled northwards. By 22 September the routed North Korean units had lost unit cohesion and become easy targets for tactical air strikes. By 25 September, identification of the enemy from the air became difficult as they scattered.Futrell, pp. 164, 167. Meanwhile, three detachments of the 3903rd Radar Bomb Scoring Group and the 1st Shoran Beacon Unit arrived in Korea with the aim of beginning a radar bombing program.Futrell, p. 355. USAF forward air controller (right) consults with a U.S. Army officer beside a radio-equipped M46 tank in Korea. On 13 October 1950, Fifth Air Force moved its Joint Operations Center forward to Seoul. The 502d TCG arrived for duty, and absorbed the provisional 6132d TCG. Nevertheless, communications between the JOC and tactical fighter wings remained problematic.Futrell, pp. 180‚Äì181. Another problem hindering forward air control was inadequate aerial photography coverage for intelligence purposes.Futrell, pp. 228‚Äì229. Having previously been driven to night operations by air strikes, the North Korean forces now basically dissolved. Almost half of their casualties‚Äîestimated at about 50,000 killed‚Äîhad been inflicted by American tactical air strikes. About three quarters of their tanks, artillery pieces, and trucks were also destroyed by air attacks. And while lines of communication had not been entirely cut, they were severely disrupted, causing delays in supplies needed.Futrell, pp. 168 ‚Äì 175. Chinese intervention The United Nations drive northward approached the Yalu River and the Korean/Chinese border as October ended. Communist Chinese \\"volunteers\\" under General Lin Biao launched massive ground assaults on the UN forces, driving them back to the south. The Chinese Air Force periodically raided into Korea, before retreating into the sanctuary of airfields in Manchuria. Chinese MiG-15s appeared; their air combat superiority to any UN aircraft rapidly became apparent. Their \\"Allied Joint Headquarters\\" at Antung was supposed to direct Chinese and North Korean air efforts; however, it was run by Russian advisers. In turn, the U.S. introduced F-86 Sabre jets into Korea as a counter to the Mig-15s. Successful Sabre pilots reported seeing Caucasian pilots eject from failing MiGs.Futrell, pp. 214‚Äì221, 228, 244, 401.Documentary \\"MiG 15: Russian Stealth\\", Battle Stations, 2000 ‚Äì 2006, beginning at 18:34. Retrieved on 4 November 2015. During November 1950, the United Nations 8th Army reeled southwards along Korea's western coast. X Corps fought its way south along the country's eastern coast. The UN retreat was supported by all-out tactical air operations. Task Force 77 (TF 77) began liaison with the 5th Air Force Joint Operations Center, though inadequate communications hampered naval aviation efforts. The Chinese ground forces, having never before fought an enemy supported by an air force, exposed themselves to air attacks en masse as they rushed after the retreating UN troops. During early December, air power alone opposed communist progress, as air strikes inflicted severe casualties on their troops advancing in the open.Futrell, pp. 254‚Äì266, 342‚Äì343. Nevertheless, the Chinese communists and the resuscitated North Korean Army pushed United Nations forces southward from Seoul. They were unsupported by the Chinese Air Force, which maintained air superiority in northwestern Korea. On 31 December, the communist ground forces launched an all-out offensive. Unfortunately for them, the first five days of 1951 offered crystal clear flying weather. On 1 and 2 January, the UN's Tactical Air Control Center handled fighter-bomber flights arriving over the front lines at ten-minute intervals; 60% of these flights struck with close air support for UN forces. By 3 January, most tactical sorties were seeking targets of opportunity well behind communist lines. By 5 January, the USAF estimated it had killed nearly 8,000 communist soldiers in five days; 8th Army thought the casualty count was twice that. By 25 January 1951, the UN forces had been pushed back to a line somewhat north of the 37th parallel of latitude. At dawn that day, UN troops counterattacked. An 8th Army intelligence report issued the following day estimated communist casualties at 38,000 killed; 18,820 of those dead were credited to tactical air strikes. Without their own air support, the communists had begun their withdrawal to the 38th parallel on 15 January. \\"Mosquito\\" FACs of the 6147th TCG began spotting concentrations of retreating communist troops on 30 January. Approximately 1 February 1951, General Peng Dehuai relieved an ailing Lin Biao from command. On 16 February, Peng ordered the Fourth Field Army to hold a line approximating the 38th parallel until May, when they were expected to counterattack.Futrell, pp. 281‚Äì284. The \\"Mosquito\\" T-6 FACs were parceled out to ground divisions and corps, and flew cover for those units in a series of UN offensives, such as Operation Thunderbolt, Operation Killer, and Operation Ripper. The close air support furnished was effective. In one notable incident, on 3 February 1951, ten tactical air sorties directed by \\"Mosquito Cobalt\\" near Yang-pyong killed an estimated 300 communists. In another combat on 12 February, \\"Mosquito Liberator\\" controlled three flight of fighter- bombers that blasted a trapped South Korean battalion free of communist road- blocks. On 22 February, east of Seoul, the communists suffered an estimated 1,000 casualties from 11 flights of tactical air directed by \\"Mosquito Lawsuit\\". Advancing UN troops found the landscape littered with enemy corpses in shallow graves or in the open.Futrell, pp. 344‚Äì347. In February, as the communist retreat lessened the need for close air support and increased ground fire opposed FAC aircraft, UN forward air control efforts turned toward interdiction of supplies before they could reach the Chinese and Korean units. In January, air strikes destroyed 599 communist trucks and damaged 683. The 5th Air Force established an aerial cordon in the foe's rear, 50 miles north of the bomb line, in mid-February. It consisted of three targeting areas, each assigned its own air wing for armed reconnaissance coverage. Constant rotating coverage by P-51 Mustangs and F4U Corsairs helped the FAC pilots become familiar with their areas, and thus quicker to spot and attack enemy activity. On the second day of this operation, February 13, fighter-bombers destroyed 236 communist vehicles, setting a one-day record for vehicle bomb damage assessment. February truck \\"kills\\" soared to 1,366 destroyed, 812 damaged.Futrell, pp. 332‚Äì333. March 1951 saw United Nations forces counterattacking back northwards. Once again finding communist troops in large bands in the open, forward air controllers directed deadly air strikes on them. In mid-March, the communist withdrawal came under heavy air attack averaging over 1,000 daily sorties daily, as the UN forces moved north. For example, two \\"Mosquito Granite\\" FACs set six flights of fighter-bombers on a fleeing mob of 1,200 communists on 16 March near Hongchon. The U.S 7th Division swept through soon afterwards, finding 600 bodies and 300 wounded.Futrell, pp. 349‚Äì351. On 23 March, four TACPs parachuted into battle with the 187th Regimental Combat Team at Munsan-ni as a blocking force behind the communists. \\"Mosquito\\" T-6s directed 108 sorties of protective close air support on the nearby enemy, while Task Force Growden pushed northwards to squeeze the communists. The UN forces once again established themselves along the 38th parallel.Futrell, pp. 351‚Äì355. While awaiting the long-ballyhooed communist spring offensive, the U.S. improved its forward air control procedures. Lacking the institutional memory to recall prior experience during World War II, the Americans reinvented all-weather bombing and night FAC operations. Newer radio jeeps with 12 channels replaced the older ones that had only four. Ordnance specialists began loading proximity fused bombs matched to specific targets. Forward airfields were opened to stage aircraft closer to the enemy. When the communist offensive began on 22 April 1951, the 337,000 attacking troops disregarded UN air power and paid a heavy price for it. Tactical aviation from three aircraft carriers became available for close air support on 18 May. In mid-May, radar guided night air strikes killed communist troops within 400 yards of the U.S. 2nd Division, to General Almond's delight. However, even with copious air support, the UN forces gave ground until the communist attack petered out. Then they counter-attacked. Although they drove the communists back, for the first time the latter did not withdraw out of artillery range as usual to regroup, but clung in place. On 1 July 1951, North Korean Premier Kim Il Sung and General Peng Te-huai agreed to a cease fire as both sides settled into fixed positions.Futrell, pp. 355‚Äì359, 363‚Äì371. As the communists dug in, there were fewer and less worthy targets vulnerable to tactical air strikes.Futrell, pp. 461‚Äì462. Far East Air Force (FEAF) summarized its accomplishments after a year of war. Although it did not categorize results, a considerable portion of the cited 120,000 communist casualties were inflicted by FAC directed close air support. FAC losses can be more closely estimated; they are contained in the \\"other\\" category of FEAF aircraft losses, which numbered 17. North Korean General Nam Il later remarked, during armistice negotiations, that only U.S air power and naval gunfire had prevented his side from prevailing.Futrell, pp. 371‚Äì372. Static warfare During Summer 1951, the two opposing sides settled into their own growing network of trenches a la World War I, and the forward air control situation changed. As the communists dug in, they operated only at night, and there were fewer and less worthy targets vulnerable to tactical air strikes. Even as forward air control was less successful in finding suitable enemy targets, United Nations air forces allied with the USAF‚Äîthe British air force, British navy, Australians, South Africans, Greeks, and Thais‚Äîflew a large proportion of the CAS missions.Futrell, pp. 4, 232, 258, 461‚Äì462, 517, 538‚Äì539, 561. On 25 July 1951, the FAC system was given an additional task for which it was ill-fitted. Because of the increased threat from the communist air forces, it was assigned air defense responsibilities. Tactical air direction centers would not only detect inbound enemy aircraft, but control protective night interceptors and anti-aircraft batteries. This was a makeshift measure, as the FAC radars had only a 75-mile range, leaving serious gaps in coverage.Futrell, pp. 425‚Äì426. Previously, the UN bombers had flown some interdiction missions against enemy lines of communication‚Äîprincipally rail lines. Beginning 18 August 1951, as forward air control demands diminished and the bombers began seeking more lucrative targets, much tactical air was diverted to interdiction bombing campaigns such as Operation Strangle, which was aimed at North Korea's lines of communications.Futrell, pp. 433‚Äì460. However, 96 sorties per day were routinely reserved for close air support of the 8th Army, with more sorties on call. On 2 September 1951, UN offensive operations in the Punchbowl vicinity kicked off. During the month of September, 5th Air Force flew 2,451 CAS sorties; 1,664 of those were flown in support of X Corps.Futrell, pp. 465‚Äì467. U.S. Marine Corps forward air controllers in action in Korea in 1951. They are observing effects of an air strike by a Corsair. On 1 September 1951, the Chinese Air Force‚Äînow suddenly one of the world's largest due to Soviet aid‚Äîkicked off a campaign to regain air superiority over North Korea. Although an inexperienced air force, flying with no set tactical doctrine, their 525 MiG-15s outnumbered FEAF's 89 F-86 Sabres by a six to one margin. MiG-15 formations emerging from their Manchurian sanctuary could number up to 90 planes. Being able to fly higher than the F-86s, MiG-15s would hang above UN aircraft before choosing to attack with an advantage. On 25 September, a UN reconnaissance plane spotted an advanced 7,000-foot-long airfield for MiGs being built near Saamchan, North Korea. Two other airstrips under construction were spotted on 14 October, close enough to the original one that aircraft from one field could defend all three. If the communists succeeded in manning these fields, they would have air superiority all the way south to Pyongyang. These three fields were targeted for B-29 raids. The three airfields were cratered into disuse, but B-29 losses were severe enough that they switched to night operations to reduce casualties. By mid-December 1951, it became apparent the communists had lost their attempt at air superiority.Futrell, pp. 403‚Äì404, 406‚Äì412, 416, 418. As the North Korean air defenses became increasingly dangerous to the \\"Mosquito\\" FACs, the FACs limited their incursions over enemy ground to a couple of miles. Beginning 1 October, the 6147th TCG was assigned FAC pilots on a permanent basis, as the temporary duty system being used degraded pilot efficiency.Futrell, p. 463. By October 1951, the UN forces had switched to defensive mode as both sides settled in awaiting the results of truce talks. Forward air control became a matter of routinely striking enemy fortifications, usually with little result. Demand for FACs should have slackened. However, UN divisional commanders felt they \\"owned\\" the right to close air support missions, and continued to demand their perceived share of strike sorties.Futrell, p. 468. By March 1952, UN pilot experience with close air support had dwindled to the point that 90% of one fighter group pilots had never flown a CAS sortie. Subsequent rotation of assignments gave all the fighter-bomber squadrons CAS experience. Tactical air strikes on the communist front line positions were of minimal use; however, the training preserved CAS capability for the forward air controllers to direct in case of a renewed offensive by the communists.Futrell, p. 470. However, the ever-increasing hazard to the aerial \\"Mosquito\\" forward air controllers led to changes. On 20 July 1952, experimentation began with aerial pathfinders. Two experienced pilots would depart before the main formation to spot targets, and fly the initial strike to mark them. Re-investigation of radar bombing techniques also began.Futrell, pp. 542‚Äì543. As truce talks continued, communist \\"land grab\\" attacks became common. By July 1953, the final month's fighting, the 6147th TCG was keeping as many as 28 \\"Mosquito\\" T-6s on forward air control duties simultaneously. On 12 July 1953, the Air Force Joint Operations Center finally established secure trustworthy communications via Radioteletype between itself and the Navy's Task Force 77. A naval liaison officer was also stationed at the JOC. By combat's end, the communists had lost an estimated 72,000 men in their final offensive.Futrell, pp. 674‚Äì679. The turf war As noted above, conditions were set from the start for a turf war. On 5 July 1950, General Partridge assigned 10 officers and 35 enlisted men to a Joint Operations Center (JOC) in accordance with FM 31‚Äì35. Located in Taejon, the JOC was ready to receive air strike requests from the U.S. Army. However, the Army side of the JOC went unmanned; there was no Army Air Ground Operations System gathering air strike requests and submitting them to the Air Force side of the JOC. General Almond did not forward any liaison to the JOC; however, he demanded TACPs be assigned to every one of the battalions in his command, when he knew that was impossible.Schlight, pp. 161‚Äì164. On 14 July 1950, Almond formed his own targeting section in his headquarters, to compete with the Air Force target system. On 23 July, General Otto P. Weyland, who had commanded forward air control support for General George S. Patton during World War II, submitted a memo claiming that Almond's targeting section was incompetent. In a staff meeting the following day, Almond unsuccessfully tried to intimidate Weyland into changing his views. Though Almond's targeting section was dissolved on 2 August, it was emblematic of his belief that forward air control was the least of the Air Force's concerns. Almond's belief that tactical air squadrons should be parceled out to support individual infantry divisions harked back to the doctrine of early World War II. Almond largely commandeered the 1st Marine Air Wing and its auxiliary U.S. Navy aviation to fly close air support for his X Corps.Futrell, pp. 50‚Äì51. When Partridge reported the JOC situation to MacArthur's headquarters on 9 August, he was later informed by MacArthur that the improvised system sufficed for the present. When Partridge visited X Corps in November, he found both Almond and his staff unknowledgeable of FM 31‚Äì35.Schlight, pp. 124, 161‚Äì164. An investigative team headed by U.S. Army Brigadier General Gerald G. Higgins was dispatched to Korea in late Autumn 1950. After widespread interviews with commanders from battalion level upwards, the team concluded the existing field expedient system was effective. It noted that proper communications nets were lacking, and personnel had not been thoroughly trained in forward air control techniques. They also calculated that supporting every Army division with 216 aircraft per Marine Corps practice was financially impossible. The Higgins report, which pointed out Army deficiencies, was ignored when Almond submitted a report more favorably received by higher headquarters.Schlight, pp. 159‚Äì167. In the meantime, back in Washington DC during October 1950, Army Chief of Staff General J. Lawton Collins submitted a memorandum to his Air Force counterpart, General Hoyt Vandenberg outlining Army complaints with the forward air control system and plumping for parceling close air support aircraft to its divisions. A month later, General Almond reported from Korea; his requests for improvements echoed that of Collins. During the same time frame, an Air Force team headed by General Glenn O. Barcus noted that the army's nonparticipation in the JOC hobbled close air support efforts. The Barcus report also contained suggestions to improve the Air Force participation in CAS. In early 1951, a joint Army and Air Force board met under the chairmanship of Army Brigadier General J. J. Burns. Meeting in Taegu, where the JOC and 8th Army headquarters were collocated, the board issued its report on 26 March 1951. It characterized the ongoing tactical air support as both \\"applicable\\" and \\"sound and adequate\\" for Korean operations. Although the Army representatives on the board thought Tactical Air Control Parties should be stationed down to battalion level, they recognized it was impossible under the circumstances. In the absence of TACPs equipped with VHF radios, and with inadequate communications nets, the best a TACP could do was collocate with a regimental headquarters and coordinate air strikes with the organic artillery. The Army representatives also complained there weren't enough \\"Mosquito\\" airborne FACs to keep one stationed over every Army division during daylight.Futrell, pp. 359‚Äì360. On 2 September 1951, UN offensive operations in the vicinity of the Punchbowl kicked off. Despite his parent X Corps being supported by two-thirds of the CAS sorties flown, Marine General Gerald C. Thomas believed his 1st Division was shortchanged. On 2 October, he complained and claimed his division needed 40 of the 96 sorties of CAS allocated every day. It was pointed out to him that when Marine pilots checked in with the JOC that they were forwarded to support Marine ground units as much as possible, and that he received on-call support from Air Force sorties.Futrell, pp. 467‚Äì468. On 17 December 1951, Army General James Van Fleet complained to 5th Air Force that his three corps commanders did not control their air assets. On 20 December, in a letter to General Matthew Ridgway, Van Fleet wanted a Marine squadron parceled out to each corps; they would fly \\"close interdiction\\" missions within 40 miles of the front under control of Army artillery observers.Futrell, pp. 540‚Äì541. With changes in the UN high command, the turf war renewed. On 1 July 1952, Army General Mark Clark turned down Van Fleet's proposal. After stating that he had not assumed command in Korea to aggravate Army-Air Force contentions over forward air control, he reviewed the ongoing dispute. On 11 August, he issued a command letter urging improvement of the current system. This led to increased indoctrination and training in the air-ground system, as well as experimentation with Pathfinder missions, and improvements in radar-controlled bombing. The objection to attaching squadrons to ground units was that increased casualties among the dedicated CAS squadrons would soon lead to their ineffectiveness.Futrell, pp. 541‚Äì543. Beginning 26 December 1952, Clark had operational demonstrations of close air support directed in the area of operations of each U.S. division in Korea. The USAF briefed and directed the tactical air strikes, but learned little from them. Air Force officers protested the unnecessary risk of life in these demonstrations. On 25 January 1953, the 7th Division staged a live fire exercise against T-Bone Hill as part of a CAS demonstration. The raid brought back no prisoners, and two attacking platoons suffered 64 casualties. When this news hit American newspapers, public outcry ensued. On 14 February 1953, the last demonstration was flown. Clark claimed the experiments had verified the utility of the FAC system.Futrell, p. 544. Legacy In May 1953, a forward air control school began at Luke AFB; it was cancelled on 26 July when the Korean War ended. It had graduated 51 FACs. By war's end, the United Nations air campaign had become so dependent on airborne FAC's directing strikes on targets invisible to ground FACs that the latter could go three months without directing a strike.Lester, p. 75. The Mosquitoes flew through war's end, amassing 40,354 sorties, two Presidential Unit Citations, and a Korean Presidential Unit Citation. United Nations air forces had flown 96,210 close air support sorties (not including an unknown number for the U.S. Navy). UN air support was credited with killing 184,808 enemy troops. In turn, Far East Air Force suffered 1,144 killed in action. UN aircraft losses totaled 1,986.Futrell, p. 692. As the fighting halted, a joint conference of the American Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps was held in Seoul to consider future forward air control operations. The U.S. Army still wanted its own Air Corps; the U.S. Air Force still insisted on its independence, and its ability to supply close air support as needed. The end of the Korean War saw no perceptible change in forward air control doctrine from the war's start. Matters continued post-1953 as they had in 1950; there would be no perceptible moves to settle forward air control doctrine for the U.S. military between 1946 and 1966.Schlight, pp. 174‚Äì177.Lester, pp. 74‚Äì77. The Mosquitoes were disbanded in 1956, as they were considered a wartime expedient. After their disbandment, the United States once again had no Forward Air Control capabilities. The 1957 STRICOM (U.S. Strike Command) Manual defined the forward air controller as ground bound. There would be no more airborne FACs until 1962.

A re-recording of the album was released via Matador Records on February 16, 2018. Background and recording Writing for Twin Fantasy began in mid-2011 after Toledo transferred from Virginia Commonwealth University to the College of William and Mary due to feelings of isolation and anxiety. He specified in an interview with Uproxx that it was the first Car Seat Headrest album to be conceived of and written as a full album, rather than a collection of songs. This change in style had been a result of the writing process for the album's second and longest track, \\"Beach Life-in-Death\\". Twin Fantasy was performed and produced entirely by Toledo, and would feature a prominent use of lo-fi production, largely due to his lack of resources. The album's cover art was also created by Toledo, with booklet art provided by independent comic artist Cate Wurtz, who had previously worked with Toledo on the artwork for 3, 4, and My Back is Killing Me Baby. Twin Fantasy was initially released via the online music platform Bandcamp on November 2, 2011. Upon its release, Toledo estimates the album was downloaded by around 100 people, but has since gone on to be downloaded over 33,000 times as of 2018.  Music and lyrics  Toledo stated via Tumblr that Twin Fantasy is a concept album which explores a relationship he was in at the time.http://carseatheadrest.tumblr.com/post/33275399506/is-twin-fantasy-a- concept-album \\"Beach Life-In-Death\\", the longest track on the album, clocks in at 12 minutes and 11 seconds and changes style multiple times throughout. The lyric sheet included with downloads separates the song into three parts. Toledo has noted that his main sources of inspiration for the album included Pink Floyd, Of Montreal, Destroyer, and They Might Be Giants, along with various romantic poets he had been studying at the time. The chorus from \\"Ana Ng\\" by They Might Be Giants was interpolated into \\"Cute Thing\\" with some minor changes.  Track listing  All tracks written and performed by Will Toledo.

ADCs utilize potent small molecule payloads, similar to those used for chemotherapy, but are designed to target only the cancer cells and spare normal, healthy tissues. The proprietary technology of Synaffix was developed to enable the treatment of a wide variety of cancer types and is designed to significantly enhance the effectiveness while also improving the safety and tolerability of these targeted cancer therapeutics. Benchmarking studies consistently demonstrate that, with a given antibody and ADC payload, ADCs produced using Synaffix technology display significantly enhanced effectiveness and significantly enhanced tolerability and safety versus all 3-major clinical- stage ADC technologies. The most advanced ADC that employs Synaffix technology will be given to the first cancer patients in 2018. In October 2016, Synaffix made the first public disclosure of its commercial license agreement with ADC Therapeutics Sarl (ADCT). Under the terms of the Agreement, ADCT may develop one or multiple products using Synaffix technology. In October 2017, Synaffix announced that ADC Therapeutics had triggered a second target-specific license under their existing deal from 2016 to develop a second ADC product candidate using Synaffix technology. Beyond this, ADC Therapeutics retains an option to take a limited number of additional single-target licenses for their potential future programs. Most recently, Synaffix has secured granted patents covering its ADC technology that offer end-to-end protection on resulting therapeutic products through at least 2035. Synaffix was founded in 2010 based on inventions made in the field of copper-free click chemistry at the Radboud University in Nijmegen. Subsequently, this chemistry was combined with the use of enzymatic antibody modification in order to facilitate the generation of targeted cancer therapeutics.

As a house designer for Lord & Taylor, Brigance was best known for bathing costumes and play clothes, and for his clever use of flattering details such as pleats and darts. During the 1930s Brigance was a rare example of a male working in the female-dominated world of American sportswear design. In the late 1930s, he was regularly mentioned alongside Clare Potter as a leading name in mid-range priced sportswear. Like Potter, Brigance was skilled at designing smart, fashionable clothing which could easily be mass-produced, making his work attractive to manufacturers as well as to customers. After serving in the Army during the Second World War, Brigance resumed designing for Lord & Taylor and for Charles W. Nudelman; branching out into a wider range of garments, including suits, coats, and formal wear. He was known for his clever use of unusually textured and/or unexpected fabrics, such as a flannel swimsuit, and in 1953, reportedly designed over half of the textiles in his collections himself. In 1953 Brigance was awarded the Coty Award for his designs. Brigance continued designing during the 1960s and 1970s, focusing on swimwear for various companies. One of his swimsuit designs for Gabar, produced before his retirement in the late 1970s, was still a best-selling design for the company in 1990. He died in New York in 1990.

Jennifer has become a painter, is still beautiful and unmarried, and seems attracted to Bob, even kissing him goodbye at the airport. Bob falls in love with her all over again. Back in New York just before Christmas, Bob's frustrations lead him to decide with his partner Steve Warner to close down their jingle-writing business, thus putting Mario out of a job. However, before Bob can inform Mario, Mario makes a grateful speech thanking Bob for all Bob has done for him, leaving Bob feeling too guilty to speak further. Bob then learns the producers are seriously considering hiring him, but that they insist he come to Los Angeles to record music for the final audition. Bob reluctantly agrees to go, although he prefers to work from New York. Upon arriving, Bob calls Jennifer and invites her to his recording session and to dinner, but she abruptly turns him down. A dejected Bob goes to the studio, but cheers up after David arrives unexpectedly to play piano at his session, and then Jennifer arrives, having changed her mind. Afterwards, Bob confesses to Jennifer that he composed the love song recorded at the session many years ago with her in mind. Bob and Jennifer make love and spend time together, but Jennifer breaks up with him again, telling him that although she loves him, she's \\"not a forever person\\" and can't change. As she drives away, Bob learns that he got the film score job and that he will even be able to work from New York City as he prefers, meaning that he will not be returning to California. Heartbroken, Bob returns to New York and prepares to celebrate the holidays with his family and friends. While he is hosting a children's Christmas party, Jennifer suddenly appears, having reconsidered the breakup, and Bob and Jennifer happily reunite. Cast Peter Billingsley, then a child actor who became well known a few years later as \\"Ralphie\\" in A Christmas Story, made one of his first film appearances in the Christmas party scene. Production Brooks made If Ever I See You Again as the follow-up to his successful 1977 film, You Light Up My Life, which Brooks had produced, written, directed and scored. You Light Up My Life was a box office hit and the title song \\"You Light Up My Life\\" was an even bigger success, setting a new record for most weeks at #1 on the Hot 100 Chart and winning Brooks an Academy Award for Best Original Song, a Grammy Award for Song of the Year, and other honors. Brooks' partner, Robert K. Lifton, later wrote that he and Brooks set out to make a similar follow-up, as financing was likely to be available for a concept that had already been proven successful. In his self-published memoir, Lifton wrote that they \\"focus[ed] on making low cost movies with music that could carry the movie and let the record help the movie and the movie help the record.\\" For If Ever I See You Again, Brooks and Lifton obtained financing from a friend whose son was seeking a movie business experience, and were therefore able to make the movie with little financial risk to themselves. Daily Variety at the time of production reported a budget of first $1.45 million and later $1.8 million. Film historian Paul Talbot later reported the production budget as $3 million. In addition to producing, co-writing, directing and scoring the film, Brooks also decided to play the leading role of \\"Bob Morrison\\" himself. Although the character mirrored Brooks' own life as a rich, successful composer of advertising jingles who moved into film work, Brooks had no significant acting experience. Brooks claimed to have spent $20,000 on giving himself two screen tests to make sure he could play the role and received Columbia Pictures' approval based on the tests. In a New York Times interview while the film was in production, Brooks said, \\"I really thought I was the best guy to play the lead.\\" According to one columnist, Brooks cast himself in the part after Al Pacino and George Segal both turned it down. Like Brooks, most of the other main actors were also inexperienced. Jerry Keller and Kenny Karen were former pop musicians turned jingle creators who had worked with Brooks in the past. Keller's film experience consisted of a bit part in You Light Up My Life as an orchestra music director. Shelley Hack was then a model best known for appearing in a television commercial for Revlon's \\"Charlie\\" fragrance, who had a two-line part in Woody Allen's acclaimed film Annie Hall. Jimmy Breslin and George Plimpton were primarily known as journalists and authors, although Plimpton had small parts in several previous films. Working titles for the film included The Mozart of Madison Avenue and California. It was shot in New York City and Los Angeles during the holiday season of 1977. The cast provided their own wardrobes. Hack, who in real life was nearsighted, wore her own glasses. According to Daily Variety, Columbia spent an additional $2.5 million on promoting the film. In addition to the soundtrack album, a paperback novelization of the screenplay was released by Bantam Books in May 1978 as a promotional tie-in. As a further promotional gimmick, Columbia teamed with Pertec Computer to \\"reunite lost lovers whenever a toll-free number is called\\" by having a computer match up the details of callers. An editor of Minicomputer News and his secretary posed as former lovers attempting to locate each other to test the service, with somewhat unsuccessful results. Soundtrack In keeping with the idea of \\"music that could carry the movie,\\" Brooks wrote a number of songs for the film: he also revived for the soundtrack the 1966 Julie Monday regional hit \\"Come Share the Good Times With Me\\" with the title adjusted to \\"Come Share My Love\\" (Brooks had produced the Julie Monday recording but its songwriting credit had been to Gilbert Kennington a pseudonym for Brooks' brother Gilbert Kaplan: however authorship of \\"Come Share My Love\\" was credited to Brooks himself). Prior to the film's release, Brooks arranged for Debby Boone, who in the preceding months had achieved blockbuster success with her debut solo single: her rendition of the theme song from Brooks' first film production You Light Up My Life, to record versions of the title theme \\"If Ever I See You Again\\", \\"California\\", \\"Come Share My Love\\", \\"It Was Such a Good Day\\", and \\"When It's Over\\". Boone released \\"California\\" in February 1978 as the follow-up to \\"You Light Up My Life\\", but \\"California\\" only reached #50 on the Hot 100 chart, failing to duplicate Boone's previous success. The versions recorded by Boone were eventually released on her album Midstream (1978). After the relative failure of Boone's \\"California\\", Brooks reached out to Atlantic Records to get Roberta Flack, an established artist with a track record of number one hits, to record \\"If Ever I See You Again\\". According to Flack, she \\"couldn't stand\\" the song and agreed to record it only after being pressured by the president of Atlantic and negotiating a \\"huge money deal\\". Flack subsequently recorded versions of the title song as well as \\"Come Share My Love\\" and \\"When It's Over\\", all produced by Brooks. Flack's version of \\"If Ever I See You Again\\" was released in April 1978 in preparation for the May 1978 opening of the film. Although the song was a moderate hit, reaching #24 on the Hot 100, #1 on the Billboard Easy Listening chart, and #37 on the R&B; chart, it failed to match the success of several previous hit singles by Flack, much less the popularity of \\"You Light Up My Life\\". The film songs recorded by Flack, including \\"If Ever I See You Again\\", were included on her self-titled 1978 album Roberta Flack. Brooks also recorded the film's songs for an album on Atlantic titled The Joe Brooks Group. An original soundtrack double album for the film was also released on Warner Bros., which contained instrumental music from the film, Boone's versions of \\"California\\" and \\"Come Share My Love\\", and other songs performed by studio musicians including male vocalist Jamie Carr (who sang the theme song in the film). The album did not contain Flack's version of the theme song or any other contributions by Flack.

Hack later admitted in an interview that it was \\"a bomb\\". Reportedly, it failed to recoup its production budget or even its promotional costs. Some of the criticism centered on poor acting by Brooks or other members of the inexperienced cast. Breslin and the film were nominated in Harry and Michael Medved's 1980 book The Golden Turkey Awards in the category \\"Worst Acting Performance by a Novelist\\". Leonard Maltin, who gave it a grade of 1 1/2 stars, stated, \\"Breslin should stick to his typewriter.\\" At the 1978 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, the movie won Worst Picture. When the Stinkers Ballot Expansion Project launched in 2003, the movie received the following notes: * Worst Film (now a nomination, with Renaldo and Clara being the new winner) * Worst Sense of Direction for Brooks (nominated) * Worst Song Or Song Performance in a Film or Its End Credits for \\"If Ever I See You Again\\" by Joe Brooks (nominated) * Worst Screen Couple for Brooks and Hack (nominated) * Worst Actress for Hack (dishonourable mention) * Worst Song Or Song Performance in a Film or Its End Credits for \\"California\\" by Brooks (dishonourable mention) The film's reputation did not improve with time. In 2011, an article in New York magazine termed it an \\"obscure flop\\". If Ever I See You Again was released on VHS in 1986. As of 2015, it had not been released on DVD.

She discovered around 150 new nebulae and was posthumously honored for her discovery of the planet 2388 Gase and the Gaze Crater on Venus, both of which are named after her. Early life and education Gaze was born on 29 December (17 December O.S.) 1899 (N.S.) in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Between 1921 and 1926, she worked at the Astronomical Institute of Leningrad (forerunner to the ) and studied at the Petrograd University. She graduated in 1924, and in 1926 went to work at the Pulkovo Observatory. Career She participated in the 1929 gravimetric survey expedition and the 1936 expedition to observe the total solar eclipse. The 1936 eclipse crossed the Soviet territory and could only be viewed within the USSR. Nearly 30 international expeditions traveled to Russia on June 19 for the observations which were visible for two hours. Between 1936 and 1940, Gaze was a victim of \\"political repression\\", which stemmed from an incident bringing unfavorable publicity to the Pulkovo Observatory. In 1935, she had discovered that a report she had been given to translate into English, made by Nikolai Mikhailovich, Voronov contained errors in its calculations. Voronov was a rising star and had published a paper on the theories of the motion of small planets. He was offered a position at the Pulkovo Observatory on the basis of that paper and produced another, calculating the ephemeris of 13 Egeria. It was in this paper that Gaze found the error and reported it to her superior. When questioned, Voronov admitted that he had not used his theory in making the calculations, but had estimated the locations of the planet. The scandal caused him to be fired, but was picked up by the press and all who were involved were arrested. Gaze was suspected of helping him since she had translated several of his papers. She was eventually released when signed testimony against her could not be obtained. In 1940, Gaze moved to the Simeiz Observatory, which was part of the Abastumani Astrophysical Observatory of Georgia between 1941 and 1945 and then became part of the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. She discovered, in 1940, changes in the spectrum of Œ≥ Cassiopeiae. Working with Grigory Abramovich Shajn, director of the observatory, Gaze investigated the molecular content of carbon isotopes in stars and studied the structure of nebulae, attempting to determine their size and the role of dust and gas in formation of the nebulae. She discovered around 150 \\"new galactic emission nebulae by recording their light in the red H-alpha (HŒ±) emission\\". In 1952 Gaze and Shajn published a book together entitled, Some results of the study of diffuse gaseous nebulae and their attitude to cosmogony. Death and legacy Gaze died on 3 October 1954 in Leningrad and was buried at the memorial cemetery for astronomers, near the Pulkovo Observatory outside Saint Petersburg. Posthumously, a planet, 2388 Gase, discovered in 1977 was named after her, as was the Gaze Crater on Venus.

Florent‚Äîan ear, nose, and throat surgeon‚Äîserves as the designer and inventor while Raphael serves as the company's CEO and Shen as the company's Chief Science & Clinical Officer. Soon after founding the company, they were joined by CTO Bret Hirscher and SVP Engineering Mike Perry, who had worked with Raphael Michel nearly a decade earlier, and Chief Business Officer Matthew Welch. They received seed funding in 2013 from a range of seed funds and angels as well as Maveron. In June 2015, they received $13.6 million in Series A funding from a group of 9 investors, including Maveron, Crosslink Capital, Dolby Family Ventures, and Birchmere Ventures. Eargo announced $25m in Series B funding led by New Enterprise Associatesin December 2015, and in October 2017 closed the first tranche of Series C funding intended to raise $45m. Eargo filed for IPO on September 25, 2020 and officially listed on NASDAQ on October 16, 2020. The first hearing devices were made available for order in June 2015. The Eargo Plus was introduced in 2017 and in 2018, the Eargo Max was introduced. The Eargo Neo launched in 2019, and in 2020 the Eargo Neo HiFi was launched . Products Eargo hearing aids are certified Class 1 medical devices. Their design is modeled after the standard fishing fly, with a small speaker surrounded by medical-grade silicone fibers (for which the company uses the trademark Flexi Fibers).; the fibers allow natural bass sounds to flow more freely into the ear canal, so that only treble ranges require amplification. The devices come in two sizes and are pre-programmed with four standard profiles. To change the setting, wearers double-tap their ear, and an acoustic switch changes the sound profile. The settings for the devices in each ear can be changed independently. Users can also send their personal audiograms to licensed hearing professionals at Eargo who will custom-calibrate the device for that individual's specific needs. The hearing aids can be charged using a portable charging device that is sold with them, and are designed to hold a charge for up to 16 hours. The charging device itself is designed to last up to a week on a single charge. The company's founders have stated that these devices are designed with younger people in mind to overcome the stigma surrounding standard, bulky hearing aids. The product designer is Ammunition Design Group, which modeled the shape of the charger on a river rock and designed it for ease of use and high visibility of the hearing aids within; the company logo is based on a visualization of a digital recording of Florent Michel saying \\"Eargo\\".

The premise of the play deals with the struggle of graffiti crews, who view their work as art while others see it as vandalism. One night, one crew completes a huge piece which incite backlash from the community as opinions on the validity of graffiti as art are polarized. This play ran from February 25 to March 14, 2015. It sparked controversy in the Chicago area as it presented the graffiti crews in a positive light. One critic at the Chicago Tribune mentioned how the play \\"is a romantic ode to the art of graffiti and the act of tagging, a piece that demystifies authorial signatures and charts the storied history of graffiti art in Chicago, shouting out its great artists and their canvases, from Kennedy underpasses to CTA train yards... [but] Graffiti comes at a price. It can be invasive, self-important and disrespectful of the property of others ‚Äî and plenty of struggling folks have had to clean graffiti off something they own or love\\". Kevin Coval spoke out against the play's criticism stating that \\"Graffiti operates at the level of metaphor for voices that exist at the margins of culture who have been deliberately excluded or erased from dominate discourse\\". = Ghostwritten = Naomi Iizuka's Ghostwritten was directed by Lisa Portes in the Goodman Theatre in April 2009. The play references the war in Vietnam, creating a complex narrative on complicated dual identities of Vietnamese children, the imperialistic nature of the United States and the effects of the war, and invisible yet real geopolitical boundaries between countries and their impacts. The author adds a twist by including themes from the tale Rumpelstiltskin. The play is part of a project that ran at the Goodman Theatre called \\"Strong Women, Strong Voices\\" which focused on presenting and supporting work created by women. It had mixed reviews. One critic at the Chicago Maroon thought the play's premise was \\"so ridiculous that it would border on the comical even if the rest of the play were well- executed\\". = The Who's Tommy = The Who's Tommy is based on The Who's 1969 rock album Tommy. The story follows the life of a young boy named Tommy who is not only blind, but deaf as well. He has a very hard childhood, and constantly suffers abuse from his relatives and neighbors. His one salvation is pinball, and it is ultimately his escape when be becomes an international pinball superstar. It has been described as an \\"exhilarating story of hope, healing and the human spirit\\". In 2013, the play was remounted at the Stratford Theatre Festival where this \\"rock opera\\", one critic mentions, \\"cranked up the volume for vocal excitement and general rocking-out purposes\\". Another critic mentions how the musical is also an interesting commentary on \\"the advances ‚Äì or not ‚Äì in disability rights in the post[World War II] era\\". = Wilder: An Erotic Chamber Musical = Wilder: An Erotic Chamber Musical ran in the Peter Jay Sharp Theater in New York City from October 14, 2003 ‚Äì November 14, 2003. The plot follows a growing boy who goes through puberty in a \\"depression-era bordello\\". The plot plays with Oedipal themes while the main character reminiscences on his past. The role of the older Wilder Jessup is played by John Cullum. One critic mentioned that having such a popular and skilled lead took away from the other two members of the cast, who were \\"a little too earnest in their diction and gestures\\". Another critic mentioned that the play was seemingly an interesting premise but ultimately a \\"lost cause\\" with \\"disappointing music\\". Personal life Lisa Portes was born in Madison, Wisconsin.

Style and technique H√©ra√∞sdalur 3, 2014-15, Oil on linen, 22 1/16 x 24 13/16 inches (56.04 x 63.02 cm)Zurier paints abstract, near-monochrome paintings whose colors range from muted tones to vibrant hues. Zurier's abstract paintings are informed by abstract expressionism, Post-War French painting, and Japanese aesthetics. His main interest is in simplicity, surface modulation, and color, as those are tied to people's experience of time. Zurier's reductive paintings show his dedication to color, the material fact of painting, and the history of painting. His soft-hued abstract paintings play at crossing the line into representation with the sensation of nature, the silence of luminous weather, and the human touch. Capturing qualities of light and weather effects, Zurier employs a range of brushstrokes and surface treatments, varying from revealing the texture of the canvas or obscuring it with layers of thick impasto. Zurier's work has been described as transcending the gestural and material to evoke the emotional. While minimal, Zurier's practice is not minimalist, but rather composed of quiet works that focus on the structure and possibilities of a brushstroke. ‚ÄúI think the Japanese painter Ike No Taiga [1723‚Äì1776] was right,‚Äù Zurier has said, ‚Äúthe most difficult thing to achieve in painting is creating a space where absolutely nothing has been painted.‚Äù Selected public collections *Berkeley Art Museum, Berkeley, CA *Colby College Museum of Art, Waterville, ME *Farnsworth Museum, Rockland, ME *Microsoft Corporation Art Collection, Redmond, WA *Moderna Museet, Stockholm, Sweden *Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, TX *Oakland Museum of California, Oakland, CA *San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco, CA *University of California, San Francisco Art Collection, San Francisco, CA *Principia College, Elsah, IL Exhibitions ;Selected solo exhibitions *Zurier: Sometimes (Over Me the Mountain), BERG Contemporary, Reykjav√≠k, Iceland, 2018 *Mind of Winter¬´, Galerie Nordenhake, Berlin, Germany, 2018 *Without Distance, Peter Blum Gallery, New York, NY, 2017 *the Very End of the Blue Sky, The Club, Tokyo, Japan, 2017 *and Troubled Air, Anglim Gilbert Gallery, San Francisco, CA, 2017 *Zurier -

Sang, was a missionary surgeon and hospital administrator in Suzhou (Soochow), China. Snell was a devout Christian, and as early as age 14 he stated: \\"I aim to \\"devote myself to God's service.\\" After graduating from Vanderbilt Medical College in 1908, Dr. Snell applied for a post at the Methodist Missionary Society. He was appointed to the Methodist Episcopal Church (South) Hospital in Soochow. Snell was known for his skillful surgical work, collection of data regarding syphilis prevalence, research into the host of blood flukes, and public health campaigns against tuberculosis. Under his administration, the Soochow Hospital underwent a large expansion, acquired modern technology, and was held to a very high standard. He was considered one of \\"the finest and most skillful surgeons ever coming to China.\\" Snell encouraged the integration of local workers in the mission hospital, stating in one report: \\"Let us take into partnership with us the people among whom and for whom we are working and co-operate with them to establish medical standards.\\" The hospital where Snell once worked, now The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, is still considered one of the best in the region.  Background = Education  John Snell was born to Amy Jarett and Leonidas Snell in Knife Falls, Carlton County, Minnesota, as the 5th out of 8 children. When he was 6 years old, his family moved to John Abner Snell Graduation from Vanderbilt Kissimmee, Florida. In 1896, they moved again to Nashville, Tennessee, without his father, because his mother insisted that the children have the best possible college opportunities. Although this was originally a temporary arrangement, Snell's father never joined the rest of the family in Tennessee. Amy only rejoined him in Florida in 1916, once their children had finished schooling. In 1899, Snell enrolled and began attending Emory College. However, in 1890 he transferred to Peabody Normal School, which later became Vanderbilt University. On May 27, 1903, Snell graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree. He worked as a teacher in Goleta, California from 1903-1904, and in Calistoga from 1904-1905 in order to make enough money to support his younger siblings at home. Upon his return to Tennessee, Snell applied to Vanderbilt Medical University. Snell studied medicine until 1908, when he obtained his M.D., followed by a short internship as a doctor. Before graduation, Snell applied to the Methodist Episcopal Church for a posting abroad as a missionary worker. Nominated by William Hector Park and M.H. Polk, he was appointed the job with high praise.  Role of religion  Religion played a significant role throughout Snell's childhood. He had a Methodist upbringing, and attended Sunday school every week. When he applied for the posting as a missionary, he wrote that at age 11 he had accepted Christ as his personal savior, and that at age 14 he had a desire to devote himself to God's service. Additionally, in his final years as a student at Peabody College, John was an active member of the Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions, an organization based in New York. They aimed to \\"enroll a sufficient number of properly qualified students who purpose to devote their lives to foreign missionary work.\\" Coincidentally, Dr. Walter Lambuth, the Missionary Secretary of the Methodist Episcopal Church, who started the hospital where Snell would go on to work in Soochow, China, was on the advisory committee of the Student Volunteer Movement at the time. Lambuth held popular bible study groups of just 8-10 people in his home, one of the ways which Snell familiarized himself with Soochow and the missionary work of the Methodist Episcopal Church.  Methodist missionary work: Soochow = Early years  In January, 1909, John Snell and Grace Birkett Snell arrived in Soochow, China. The Soochow Hospital, which was also a medical school, was established in 1883 by Dr. Walter Russell Lambuth and Dr. William Hector Park. One of John and Grace Snell learning Chinese the first medical colleges in China, it consisted of free standing buildings with enclosed walkways. The school, which taught males and females, was unique in that teachers always instructed in both English and Chinese, with drug names and diseases taught in Latin. No textbooks were available, so lectures were written on blackboards and explained to students as necessary in English or Chinese. This method had great success in reducing dependency on foreign products and doctors in the hospital. The medical school had a variety of notable graduates, including Yang Vee Yuer, who became the superintendent of the Soochow Hospital and a professor at Soochow University. When Snell first arrived, Park, the head doctor at the hospital at the time, had just left on furlough for a year. Snell was left in charge of the hospital. Upon Park's return, the responsibilities were split, leaving Snell responsible for surgery and administration. Main concerns over this period included appendicitis, alcoholism, pneumonia, measles, typhoid, diphtheria, diarrheal diseases and scarlet fever, which were reported as \\"endemic\\" in Soochow in a hospital medical report. Snell was recorded as earning Mex. $12,236 in the year 1910, comparatively more than many of the missionaries working for the Methodist Episcopal Church at the time. In 1914 Snell's wages increased by $600 per year as he also took on the job of Business Manager of the Chinese Medical Journal. By 1915, the hospital was only dependent on Americans for the wages for American workers, and otherwise was self- sufficient.Dr. Snell in Surgery In 1916, the hospital recorded treatment for 15,432 in- and out-patients. Approximately 3000 of these patients were treated surgically, and the annual report noted that \\"in surgery the work has been heavier and more varied than in any preceding year.\\" Snell was one of three surgeons at the hospital according to the report, and therefore was constantly working. This was due to nearby political unrest and conflict of Wukiang in 1916, which resulted in the Red Cross asking the hospital to take on some of their patients. One of Snell's projects included informing the public about the danger of transmission of disease through insects, including flies, mosquitoes, and fruit flies. In 1917, the hospital was responsible for a campaign with the local police department to remove stagnant water and cover fruit at stands, however little success was recorded.  Construction and operation of a new hospital  Snell's biggest project and main goal in Soochow was the construction of a new hospital. In 1917, Snell was the head of the hospital and began fundraising for a bigger and better equipped hospital. He visited areas of Korea and China for construction and design ideas with G. F. Ashley, who was hired as the architect. The new hospital costs were estimated to be around $200,000, funds raised by Snell. $80,000 were provided by the Board of Missions of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and $70,000 were raised in China. However, in 1919, a large grant of $50,000 from the Rockefeller Foundation permitted construction to begin. Years later, the Rockefeller Foundation continued to fund the Soochow hospital for maintenance, research, construction and other fees, as indicated by annual reports. The hospital consisted of a two-story outpatient clinic and a three-story main hospital. The design was primarily Western, although the outpatient wing was still built in a Chinese style, connected to the main hospital through a covered gallery. It was fireproof, and included a rooftop garden, new machines, an X-ray suite, a sterilizing room, a pharmacy, religious offices, electricity, and air conditioning in 2 new well-lit operating rooms, along with other modern features. Four new hospital staff residences were constructed, and nurse's quarters were added in order to improve the nursing school for native women. Additionally, administration obtained a new X-ray machine which greatly improved the hospital's ability for diagnosis. On November 6, 1922, the hospital was officially opened, with 165 beds and new staff. It was considered one of the best hospitals in \\"China, in England, in America, or in Europe\\" according to The North-China Herald, due to its state of the art facilities, which Snell helped to initiate. In fact, in 1926, Soochow hospital was one of only 4 hospitals in China to meet the standards of the American Board of Surgeons, an indicator of its high quality facilities and doctors such as Snell. According to the China Medical Journal, at the new hospital Snell taught a popular laboratory course for technicians in order to improve diagnosis through the use of equipment. = Female Nurses Report = One of Snell's initiatives in Soochow was to employ more female nurses in both the male and female wards of the hospital, something which was rare at the time. He reported that the female nurses he worked with in China were kinder and there were fewer cases of rudeness and disrespect from male patients. Within 3 years of implementing this program, his employment of local female nurses was recommended to be used as a model in missions across China. = City Hospitals Report = Dr. Snell was a strong advocate for building modern hospitals in urban areas. He also supported the inclusion of Chinese staff on boards and in head positions of hospitals, which made him a primary contributor to the sustainability and reduced American dependence of the Soochow Hospital. In his paper, the \\"City Hospital\\", Snell encouraged all major metropolitan areas to build a minimum of one new hospital at the cost of $300,000, with Chinese members on the board and management committees of the hospitals. The report discloses Snell's beliefs on missionary work and how hospitals should be built and managed during the time period. Snell claimed that the aim of a medical mission \\"should be to primarily prevent and heal disease in the name of the Great Physician,\\" rather than \\"spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ,\\" as he says mission work does. Snell believed that medical work was much more beneficial to individuals than \\"submerging the healing by preaching,\\" and continuously pushed for the need for up-to-date medical practice and equipment, one of the reasons that the new aforementioned hospital was such a success. Snell also established the concept of treating minor medical issues in a cheaper building, while those who were seriously ill could have access to a bed and more extensive care. Another idea which affected the majority of hospitals in the region included the value of sunshine as a disinfectant, and as such he insisted all rooms receive sun. He also set up department heads with his staff, so that each doctor became a specialist in order to have more efficient treatment. These were (1) Medicine, (2), Surgery, (3) Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat, (4) Gynecology and Obstetrics and (5) Pathology. Finally, Snell recommended that small individual missions in the same region should combine to have a resources available in one larger and inclusive facility.  Research and medical work  Feces examination, hookworm, and snail fluke = On October 1, 1911, Snell made feces examination a routine part of diagnosis throughout the hospital, for every patient. This step was undertaken in order to ensure that patients with internal parasites could be treated even if it they were the primary reason for which the patient came to the hospital. Snell reported that he most often found Ankylostoma, Oxyuris, and Schistosoma japonicum. He noted that there was an infection rate of 76.4% which would go unaccounted for, and were instead usually recorded as dysentery. This later served as the motive for his extensive research into the Schistosoma japonicum hookworm infections, which he started in 1923. July 1, Soochow Hospital established a field laboratory in order to investigate the hookworm epidemic and spread of the disease. Research included analyzing the lifespan of the parasite and evaluating what could be put in fertilizers to prevent its growth on crops. The report was compiled along with Henry Edmund Meleney and Ernest Carroll, and helped to identify the mollusk as the same species as one located near Shanghai.  Appendicitis  Snell wrote a comprehensive report on the 206 treated appendicitis cases admitted to the Soochow hospital from 1914-1927, not including outpatients. Snell estimated that there was someone admitted to the hospital with appendicitis every 25 days, and that 1.1% of all patients at the hospital were diagnosed with it. However, Snell faced difficulty when he first arrived in China. Appendectomy surgeries were not widely socially acceptable at the time of his arrival, so some patients refused the surgery. In a report Snell states that out of 128 patients who required operations in one year, 34 Chinese patients refused. For example, one of Snell's patients, a teacher from a wealthy Soochow family, refused surgery in spring and his condition only degraded until September, when he was finally operated on.  Gastric ulcers  Snell insisted that gastric ulcers were far more common among Chinese patients than previously believed, and that many cases of digestive troubles were incorrectly treated. He believed that one reason for this may have been the difficulty of obtaining accurate information from patients due to language barrier and inconsistencies in patient explanations. He encouraged more thorough evaluations of patient history as an element of diagnosis, and published an extensive report, the \\"Diagnosis of Chronic Duodenal and Gastric Ulcers,\\" on how to recognize ulcers adeptly. As Snell was the doctor in charge of the X-ray and associated equipment, he devised a technique to detect ulcers via X-ray analysis through the consumption of barium-containing rice soup. The soup was a method of quick success in the hospital, as patients were more comfortable eating a dish which complied with social context as a part of medical treatment. = Cholera = In 1919, a cholera epidemic swept across Eastern China and revived local doctors' interest in the disease. Snell stated that the Soochow Hospital treated 5-6 new cases per day in the summer of 1919. They implemented a variety of treatment techniques, primarily intravenous Rogers treatment of saline solution. Snell also treated cholera patients with emetine hypodermically, and later published one of the first papers on how it could act as a poison in large doses. Of the patients at Soochow, there was 27.4% mortality. Snell was also actively involved with treating syphilis, malaria and tuberculosis. Snell's investigation into syphilis was the first comprehensive report of its kind in China.  Family  John Abner Snell and Grace Birkett John Abner Snell met his wife, Grace Evelyn Birkett Snell, his junior year of college. They were engaged in 1902 and married on November 1, 1907 in Nashville, Tennessee by Revered James Clarke. They had 7 children. Every seven years, they returned from China to the US on furlough for one year. In 1932, many of his children remained in the US after his furlough ended in order to have a better education.  Other means of income  Snell broke many mission rules about engaging in outside enterprises, arguing that they were recreation which did not minimize his time at work. His most notable hobby was his coin collection. Snell published his own article, \\"Chinese Copper Coins of the Twentieth Century,\\" in the June 1932 issue of The Numismatist. He owned approximately 950 brass, silver, and copper coins, some of them with rare patterns. They were left in a family trunk to Snell's son, John Raymond Snell and eventually auctioned to the public on December 2, 2011. His coin collection has been referenced in several coin collectors' journals and articles, such as A.M Tracey Woodward's 1931 article. In addition to his work as a missionary doctor, Dr. Snell was also started a local brick factory as well as a dairy farm, from which he sold dairy products to the local area.  Death  Grave of John Abner Snell On February 24, 1936, Snell contracted pneumonia and had a temperature recorded of 102 degrees Fahrenheit. He was admitted to the hospital and doctors were called from Huchow and Chanchow, but there was nothing that could be done. While on his deathbed, Snell is reported to have said \\"There can be nothing happier than a life whose first purpose is to demonstrate Christian love through service.\\" On March 2, 1936, Snell died of pneumonia at the age of 55. He was buried in Soochow, although the cemetery was razed during the Cultural Revolution.

As a well distinguished doctor, Neve willingly left home at a young age when he was called to Kashmir to continue the medical missions of Dr. Theodore Maxwell and Dr. William Elmsie. He moved to Asia and never looked back, soon becoming the head of the Kashmir Medical Mission where he would go on to serve the sick in Kashmir for the next thirty four years by building the Kashmir Mission Hospital with his brother, Ernest. Influenced by his strong roots in his religion, Neve served the people of Kashmir while also spreading his Christian message to a predominantly Muslim and Brahmin area. He also served in World War I as a Major at the military hospitals in Brighton and France. He was praised for his extraordinary work serving for his home and the injured of the war. Neve is also remembered as an avid mountaineer for his excursions in the rural outskirts of Kashmir, as traveling and geographical research became one of his favorite hobbies while living abroad. After finishing his time serving in the war, he returned to Kashmir in 1919 where he died shortly after.  Background = Early life and family  Arthur Neve was born on 24 December 1859 in Brighton, England. His parents were strongly devoted to the Church of England, and were interested in the medical missionary work that the Church was doing abroad at the time. His parents worked to incorporate religion into their daily lives, and growing up in a religious environment with parents who were interested in medical missionary work heavily influenced his yearn to serve abroad and his evangelical work throughout the rest of his career and his life. Neve had one younger brother named Ernest, who was two years younger than him.Mir, NA. \\"Inspirational People and Care for the Deprived: Medical Missionaries in Kashmir.\\" Royal College of Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. Mar. 2008. Web. 14 Oct. 2015. Because they were so close in age, they grew up doing everything together and attended the same schools. They ultimately had the same passions, and eventually Ernest grew up to follow in his brother's footsteps and joined Arthur's medical mission work in Kashmir. There, he became an honorary surgeon at the Kashmir Mission Hospital where he lived with his brother and remained until his death. The Neve brothers also inspired their niece, Nora Neve, to join them as a nurse in missionary service.  Education  Neve began his schooling at the Brighton Grammar School, where he attended with his brother, Ernest. He then went on to attend The University of Edinburgh in 1876.Neve, Ernest Frederic. A Crusader in Kashmir. London: Seeley, Service, 1928. Print. Having felt the call to serve early in his life, he entered his studies at the University level knowing he wanted to become a medical missionary, and completed his initial medical training there. After graduating from the University of Edinburgh he proceeded to work as a house physician in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. After gaining experience at the Infirmary, he was appointed the Resident Medical Officer to the Livingstone Memorial Dispensary and Training Society under the Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society where he continued to train and gain experience. This society had organized and participated in a fair amount of work with medical missions in the past, thus, it is here that Neve began preparing and training for his medical work abroad. In 1881, Neve became a resident physician at 39 Cowgate, which was one of many dispensaries and hostels for senior medical students that were dispersed throughout the poor districts of Edinburgh. With his district, Neve had his first exposure to working with people in need. He lived amongst the poor in the area where he was stationed for two years, and his daily tasks included medical, surgical, and maternity cases. He also worked to keep his religion alive and in practice throughout his time at 39 Cowgate, and did so by leading and planning events such as outdoor meetings and Sunday masses. Gaining this experience at 39 Cowgate became the impetus that prepared and trained Neve for his life's work serving in the poor rural areas of Kashmir.  Medical Missionary Work In Kashmir = The Journey  Knowing from an early age that he wanted to serve abroad in an area where he could live and serve among other Christians, Neve began reading books on Africa while at Livingstone in the hopes of working there after he finished his medical training. He even went as far as to inquire about working and offer to lend his services in Uganda during this time. Yet one day he received a call one day from Dr. Downes, a doctor in Kashmir who was in an urgent need for a doctor to come to Kashmir who could succeed him. Suddenly, Neve found himself accepting Downes request and decided to leave his life in the United Kingdom and move to Kashmir. Despite changing his initial plans of working and living amongst other Christians, Neve saw this choice as an opportunity not only to fulfill his passion of helping those in need but also to spread his message of Christianity to two groups living in Kashmir who strongly opposed his religion, Muslims and Brahmans. Soon after accepting Downes offer, Neve joined the Church Missionary Society and found himself heading to Kashmir. Upon his arrival to Asia, he spent his first few weeks traveling around India to places like Bombay, Ajmer, Jeypore, and Delhi. Starting his travels, he set his aim at meeting many different doctors and priests in order to build friendships and alliances with them. During these first few weeks he also sought to discover the cooperation between and presence of Anglican Baptists and Presbyterians in the area, as well as gaining insight into the different medical missions already in place around the different cities he was visiting. One of his biggest take aways from this initial tour of India was his first glimpses of the types of sicknesses and diseases he would face in this part of the world, and he discovered there was a large presence of choleraic malaria at the time. After his tour of India, Neve arrived in Kashmir in 1882 where he began his work that picked up where his predecessors, Dr. William Jackson Elmsie, Dr. Theodore Maxwell and Dr. Edmond Downes left off. Within the next two years, he was joined by Ernest, who completed his medical training and was now a doctor.Longstaff, Tom G. \\"Obituary: Arthur Neve.\\" The Geographical Journal 54.6 (1919): 396-98. JSTOR. Web. 18 Oct. 2015. In 1898, he was joined by his niece Nora Neve, who had completed her nursing training with the Church Missionary Society.  Medical Missionary Work  The Kashmir Mission Hospital = Upon his arrival to the rural town of Srinagar where he was sent to work in Kashmir, he discovered that there was already a mission hospital there that had been established by Elmsie and Maxwell and upheld by Dr. Downes since their deaths. Although he was impressed by the efficiency of what was already in place, he believed the current conditions of the hospital‚Äîleaking barns and mud huts, patients laying on the floor, and an undertrained staff‚Äîwere unsuitable for effective treatment and large scale surgery. Thus, Neve immediately knew that the first step to helping the people of Srinagar was going to be to build a new hospital that could accommodate both the procedures and patients as well as improve the training for the nurses in Srinagar. Yet due to lack of funds, lack of assistance, and initial lack of government support or complete government approval, this plan faced initial setbacks. Over the course of eight years, Neve worked with his brother to gather funds from local donors, save up money from medical service fees, and gain the approval of the Kashmiri government in order to build and open the Kashmir Mission Hospital. Although this was an extensive process, once built, the hospital became (according to Ernest), \\"one of the most important public institutions in Kashmir\\". The project began in 1888 and was fully completed and running in 1896. Replacing the mud roofs, mud walls, and mud floors, the new hospital featured Italian-style buildings complete with red roofs and picturesque verandas. There were also wings that resembled most developed hospitals, like an outpatient wing that included: waiting rooms, consulting rooms, dispensaries, laboratories, and x-ray and operating rooms. Not only were these rooms developed and sufficient, they were also all equipped with the proper medical tools and a now well-trained Kashmiri staff. The upkeep of the hospital remained in the hands of British visitors to the hospital, service fees from patients, and once the success of the hospital became apparent, the Kashmiri gentry. The people of Kashmir immediately flocked to the new hospital, as most people who lived in Srinagar had never been offered this type of sophisticated care. The most common diseases that Neve treated were cholera, tuberculosis, and eye diseases. By 1893, even before being fully completed, the hospital featured 135 beds and had treated upwards of 20,606 patients. As the years went on, the success of the hospital began to rise. Within the first ten years of its opening, annually, Neve and his staff were treating 30,000 patients, feeding 1,200 patients gratuitously, and operating on 3,000-4,000 patients per year. As the popularity of the hospital began to grow throughout Kashmir, people came from all over the area to get treated by Neve and his staff. The scope of the popularity of the hospital became apparent when the patient demographic was considered, as Ernest reported that if one was to walk through the wings of the hospital at any given time, there could be over a hundred different villages or towns represented. During the cold winters in Kashmir, Neve worked to keep his Christianity alive and placed importance on his evangelical work. He did this by having Christian pastors visit with patients in the hospital wards to offer prayers or words of comfort. He made it a point to offer this service to each and every patient, with no discrimination to any patient's religious affiliation.  Travels and Other Activities in Kashmir  Mountaineering = During times when he was able to take time off from the hospital, Neve found great enjoyment in discovering the outlying parts of Kashmir for either travel, medical work for people who could not reach his hospital, or evangelical work. His first tour in 1882 to the outskirts of Kashmir sparked this passion, as it allowed him to see other tribes, villages, people, and terrains. This first tour also led him to believe that there was more medical need and work to be done throughout these different parts of Kashmir, and this mentality contributed to what drove him to begin the long process of building the hospital. While on these excursions, Neve travelled to places like the Hindus Valley, the Saltoro Valley, and Tagur. He became a reputable mountaineer, and some of his notable climbs include a climb to Nun Kun at 23,000 feet, as well as The Nubra Valley in the Himalayas. In his down time, Neve also enjoyed many different types of music and water color sketching.  Recognitions, Accomplishments, and Time in the War = Medical Recognitions  Upon answering the call to serve abroad, Neve spent thirty four years in Kashmir as the head of the Kashmir Medical Mission\\"A Crusader in Kashmir.\\" Rev. of A Crusader in Kashmir, by Ernest Neve. The Bookman 75.445 (1928): 89. British Periodicals. Web. 18 Oct. 2015. and was the head of his self-built Kashmir Mission Hospital for thirty- seven years. He served this position right up until his death, after which his brother took it over for him. Due to the respect he gained from his medical accomplishments in the communities in Kashmir and throughout India, he was granted the position of President of the Medical Missionary Association of India from 1908-1910, and in 1909 he served as the Vice President of the Indian Medical Congress. He was awarded the Kaiser-I-Hind Gold Medal by the British Government in India in 1901. Neve was also known for his description of the unique Kangri cancer, a skin cancer found only in Kashmir.Neve A (1900) Indian med. Gaz. 35, 81  Other Achievements  Neve was an avid author and wrote often about Kashmir. He wrote books such as Kashmir, Ladakh and Tibet (1899), Picturesque Kashmir (1900), Thirty Years in Kashmir(1913), The Tourist‚Äôs Guide to Kashmir, Ladakh and Skardo (1923), which were all works that chronicled his expeditions that he took while on holidays from the hospital. His passion for mountaineering and geography led him to receive the Back Award in 1911 from the Royal Geographical Society due to his study of glaciology and his original geographical research of the Himalayas.  Medical Work in World War I  In 1914, Neve was due for a furlough, thus, he returned to Brighton and decided to offer his services and serve for the British war effort in World War I. He quickly became a Major, R.A.M.C at the Kitchener Hospital in Brighton and continued this ranking later at the Dartford Military hospital. At these hospitals, his skills helped serve not only all the injured in the war, but also the Indian troops serving for the British, as his knowledge of India and his ability to communicate with them served as a major asset. With many years experience under his belt, Neve was praised for the work he did at this war hospital, and was sent to France in 1918 to serve in their war hospital. There, Neve's work was equipped with an insufficient staff and long, strenuous days. After a year in France, Neve was able to return to his home in Kashmir where a cholera outbreak was just beginning to spread. Death and legacy Exhausted after serving for the British for four years and returning to Kashmir to immediately start treating a cholera epidemic, Dr. Arthur Neve was struck with a fever in the early fall of 1919 that resulted from an influenza he had acquired while living in France the previous year. Unable to recover, he died on 5 September 1919. Neve's loss was felt far and wide throughout Kashmir by many different people across many different religions. His funeral, according to Ernest, was a showing of the \\"...immense concourse of those of many races and religions, rich and poor, high and low, who followed‚Äîall these were signs, we may well believe, of something deeper and of more lasting importance, a true recognition of the beauty of a life spent in witness and service.\\" In his death, the Hindu and Muslim community acknowledged his loss, as a member of the Hindu society claimed, \\"...he had a special and sincere love of the country and its inhabitants, [and he] served all...without difference of race or sex.\\". Sir Aurel Stein, a distinguished authority on central Asia, spoke of Neve as a \\"...beacon of hope in this land which has suffered so much...\\". His legacy and life's work was summed up in a statement by the former Resident British Political Agent in Kashmir who said, \\"...no man living his done so much for Kashmir as he has done, and the memory of his saintly and unselfish life, and of his high skill of a surgeon will remain for many years to come, not only in Srinagar, but in nearly every village in Kashmir.\\" In honor of his death, many people donated to the Kashmir Medical Hospital where Ernest continued Neve's legacy until his own death in 1946.Shade, Chinar. \\"Dr. ARTHUR NEVE AND Dr. EARNEST NEVE :THEY BROUGHT MODERN ALLOPATHIC MEDICINES AND SURGERY TO KASHMIR.\\" Literary and Cultural Write-ups.

Characteristics The locomotive body is a welded monocoque design, constructed of steel plates and profiled members.

Dual voltage Transformer specifications: 22-013 As on the dual voltage Classes 19E, 20E and 21E, the main electric circuit is automatically selected in either AC or DC mode based on the voltage of the overhead contact wire feeding the locomotive. To facilitate automatic trouble-free transition on the run, the locomotive is equipped with onboard voltage detectors, while the overhead wire is equipped with two wooden isolators and a length of neutral wire to separate the AC and DC feeds. The neutral section is connected to the rails which serve as the return conductor on electrified lines.Class 20E manual: Part 1: Locomotive Profile and Technical Data Track magnet sensor The transition process requires that the locomotive should automatically be switched off before it reaches the isolators and the unpowered overhead wire section, and automatically be restarted after exiting from under the unpowered wire. This is done by a pair of track magnets, one on either side of the neutral overhead wire and spaced apart. The two magnets are mounted with their polarities reversed in relation to each other and they activate a magnetic relay located behind the cowcatcher of the locomotive to do the switching off and restarting. Pantographs Transnet Freight Rail insisted that the locomotive must be designed in such a way that the pantograph contact shoe centres are directly above the bogie pivot centres, as was done on the Class 7E and Class 7E2, Series 1 and Series 2, and again on the Classes 20E and 21E. The reason is to reduce the possibility of pantograph hookups on catenary in sharp curves, such as in turnouts, as a result of sideways movement of the pantograph in relation to the overhead wire.South African Railways Index and Diagrams Electric and Diesel Locomotives, 610mm and 1065mm Gauges, Ref LXD 14/1/100/20, 28 January 1975, as amended Illustration File:Class 22E 22-012.jpgNo. 22-012 at Pyramid South on 22 September 2015 File:Class 22E 22-009.jpgNo. 22-009 at Pyramid South on 27 September 2015 File:Class 22E 22-013.jpgNo. 22-013 at Pyramid South on 22 September 2015 File:Class 22E 22-045.jpgNo. 22-045 at Koedoespoort, Pretoria on 29 September 2015 References 3240 Co- Co locomotives Cape gauge railway locomotives Multi-system locomotives Railway locomotives introduced in 2015 2015 in South Africa ","title":"South African Class 22E"},{"id":"48589231","text":"The Pear Tree (Derakht-e-Golabi) is a 1998 Iranian drama movie written and directed by Dariush Mehrjui with Homayoun Ershadi and Golshifteh Farahani in the lead.

The current systems are tested by their accuracy for tasks like object detection, segmentation and localization. Methods like the convolutional neural networks seem to be doing pretty well in these tasks, but the current systems are still not close to solving the ultimate problem of understanding images the way humans do. So motivated by the ability of humans to understand an image and even tell a story about it, Geman et al. have introduced the Visual Turing Test for computer vision systems. As described in, it is ‚Äúan operator-assisted device that produces a stochastic sequence of binary questions from a given test image‚Äù. The query engine produces a sequence of questions that have unpredictable answers given the history of questions. The test is only about vision and does not require any natural language processing. The job of the human operator is to provide the correct answer to the question or reject it as ambiguous. The query generator produces questions such that they follow a ‚Äúnatural story line‚Äù, similar to what humans do when they look at a picture.  History  Research in computer vision dates back to the 1960s when Seymour Papert first attempted to solve the problem. This unsuccessful attempt was referred to as the Summer Vision Project. The reason why it was not successful was because computer vision is more complicated than what people think. The complexity is in alignment with the human visual system. Roughly 50% of the human brain is devoted in processing vision, which clearly indicates that it is a difficult problem. Later there were attempts to solve the problems with models inspired by the human brain. Perceptrons by Frank Rosenblatt, which is a form of the neural networks, was one of the first such approaches. These simple neural networks could not live up to their expectations and had certain limitations due to which they were not considered in future research. Later with the availability of the hardware and some processing power the research shifted to image processing which involves pixel-level operations, like finding edges, de-noising images or applying filters to name a few. There was some great progress in this field but the problem of vision which was to make the machines understand the images was still not being addressed. During this time the neural networks also resurfaced as it was shown that the limitations of the perceptrons can be overcome by Multi-layer perceptrons. Also in the early 1990s convolutional neural networks were born which showed great results on digit recognition but did not scale up well on harder problems. The late 1990s and early 2000s saw the birth of modern computer vision. One of the reasons this happened was due to the availability of key, feature extraction and representation algorithms. Features along with the already present machine learning algorithms were used to detect, localise and segment objects in Images. While all these advancements were being made, the community felt the need to have standardised datasets and evaluation metrics so the performances can be compared. This led to the emergence of challenges like the Pascal VOC challenge and the ImageNet challenge. The availability of standard evaluation metrics and the open challenges gave directions to the research. Better algorithms were introduced for specific tasks like object detection and classification. Visual Turing Test aims to give a new direction to the computer vision research which would lead to the introduction of systems that will be one step closer to understanding images the way humans do.  Current evaluation practices  A large number of datasets have been annotated and generalised to benchmark performances of difference classes of algorithms to assess different vision tasks (e.g., object detection/recognition) on some image domain (e.g., scene images). One of the most famous datasets in computer vision is ImageNet which is used to assess the problem of object level Image classification. ImageNet is one of the largest annotated datasets available and has over one million images. The other important vision task is object detection and localisation which refers to detecting the object instance in the image and providing the bounding box coordinates around the object instance or segmenting the object. The most popular dataset for this task is the Pascal dataset. Similarly there are other datasets for specific tasks like the H3D dataset for human pose detection, Core dataset to evaluate the quality of detected object attributes such as colour, orientation, and activity. Having these standard datasets has helped the vision community to come up with extremely well performing algorithms for all these tasks. The next logical step is to create a larger task encompassing of these smaller subtasks. Having such a task would lead to building systems that would understand images, as understanding images would inherently involve detecting objects, localising them and segmenting them.  Details  The Visual Turing Test (VTT) unlike the Turing test has a query engine system which interrogates a computer vision system in the presence of a human co-ordinator. It is a system that generates a random sequence of binary questions specific to the test image, such that the answer to any question k is unpredictable given the true answers to the previous k ‚àí 1 questions (also known as history of questions). The test happens in the presence of a human operator who serves two main purposes: removing the ambiguous questions and providing the correct answers to the unambiguous questions. Given an Image infinite possible binary questions can be asked and a lot of them are bound to be ambiguous. These questions if generated by the query engine are removed by the human moderator and instead the query engine generates another question such that the answer to it is unpredictable given the history of the questions. The aim of the Visual Turing Test is to evaluate the Image understanding of a computer system, and an important part of image understanding is the story line of the image. When humans look at an image, they do not think that there is a car at ‚Äòx‚Äô pixels from the left and ‚Äòy‚Äô pixels from the top, but instead they look at it as a story, for e.g. they might think that there is a car parked on the road, a person is exiting the car and heading towards a building. The most important elements of the story line are the objects and so to extract any story line from an image the first and the most important task is to instantiate the objects in it, and that is what the query engine does.  Query engine  The query engine is the core of the Visual Turing Test and it comprises two main parts : Vocabulary and Questions = Vocabulary = Vocabulary is a set of words that represent the elements of the images. This vocabulary when used with appropriate grammar leads to a set of questions. The grammar is defined in the next section in a way that it leads to a space of binary questions. The vocabulary \\\\mathcal{V} consist of three components: # Types of Objects \\\\mathcal{T} # Type-dependent attributes of objects \\\\mathcal{A}(t) # Type-dependent relationships between two objects \\\\mathcal{R}(t,t') For Images of urban street scenes the types of objects include people, vehicle and buildings. Attributes refer to the properties of these objects, for e.g. female, child, wearing a hat or carrying something, for people and moving, parked, stopped, one tire visible or two tires visible for vehicles. Relationships between each pair of object classes can be either ‚Äúordered‚Äù or ‚Äúunordered‚Äù. The unordered relationships may include talking, walking together and the ordered relationships include taller, closer to the camera, occluding, being occluded etc. 330x330px Additionally all of this vocabulary is used in context of rectangular image regions w \\\\in W which allow for the localisation of objects in the image. An extremely large number of such regions are possible and this complicates the problem, so for this test, regions at specific scales are only used which include 1/16 the size of image, 1/4 the size of image, 1/2 the size of image or larger. = Questions = The question space is composed of four types of questions: * Existence questions: The aim of the existence questions is to find new objects in the image that have not been uniquely identified previously. They are of the form : Qexist = 'Is there an instance of an object of type t with attributes A partially visible in region w that was not previously instantiated?' * Uniqueness questions: A uniqueness question tries to uniquely identify an object to instantiate it. Quniq = 'Is there a unique instance of an object of type t with attributes A partially visible in region w that was not previously instantiated?' The uniqueness questions along with the existence questions form the instantiation questions. As mentioned earlier instantiating objects leads to other interesting questions and eventually a story line. Uniqueness questions follow the existence questions and a positive answer to it leads to instantiation of an object. * Attribute questions: An attribute question tries to find more about the object once it has been instantiated. Such questions can query about a single attribute, conjunction of two attributes or disjunction of two attributes. Qatt(ot) = {'Does object ot have attribute a?' , 'Does object ot have attribute a1 or attribute a2?' , 'Does object ot have attribute a1 and attribute a2?'} * Relationship questions: Once multiple objects have been instantiated, a relationship question explores the relationship between pairs of objects. Qrel(ot,ot') = 'Does object ot have relationship r with object ot'?'  Implementation details  As mentioned before the core of the Visual Turing Test is the query generator which generates a sequence of binary questions such that the answer to any question k is unpredictable given the correct answers to the previous k ‚àí 1 questions. This is a recursive process, given a history of questions and their correct answers, the query generator either stops because there are no more unpredictable questions, or randomly selects an unpredictable question and adds it to the history. The question space defined earlier implicitly imposes a constraint on the flow of the questions. To make it more clear this means that the attribute and relationship questions can not precede the instantiation questions. Only when the objects have been instantiated, can they be queried about their attributes and relations to other previously instantiated objects. Thus given a history we can restrict the possible questions that can follow it, and this set of questions are referred to as the candidate questions Q_\\\\text{can}. The task is to choose an unpredictable question from these candidate questions such that it conforms with the question flow that we will describe in the next section. For this, find the unpredictability of every question among the candidate questions. Let H be a binary random variable, where H(I) = 1, if the history H is valid for the Image I and 0 otherwise. Let q \\\\in Q can be the proposed question, and X_q be the answer to the question q. Then, find the conditional probability of getting the answer Xq to the question q given the history H. : P_H (X_q = x) = \\\\frac{P\\\\\\\\{I : H(I) = 1, X_q(I) = x\\\\\\\\}}{P\\\\\\\\{I : H(I) = 1\\\\\\\\}} Given this probability the measure of the unpredictability is given by: : \\\\rho_H(q) = P_H(X_Q = 1) - 0.5 The closer \\\\rho_H(q) is to 0, the more unpredictable the question is. \\\\rho_H(q) for every question is calculated. The questions for which \\\\rho_H(q) < \\\\epsilon, are the set of almost unpredictable questions and the next question is randomly picked from these.  Question flow  As discussed in the previous section there is an implicit ordering in the question space, according to which the attribute questions come after the instantiation questions and the relationship questions come after the attribute questions, once multiple objects have been instantiated. Therefore, the query engine follows a loop structure where it first instantiates an object with the existence and uniqueness questions, then queries about its attributes, and then the relationship questions are asked for that object with all the previously instantiated objects. = Look-ahead search = It is clear that the interesting questions about the attributes and the relations come after the instantiation questions, and so the query generator aims at instantiating as many objects as possible. Instantiation questions are composed of both the existence and the uniqueness questions, but it is the uniqueness questions that actually instantiate an object if they get a positive response. So if the query generator has to randomly pick an instantiation question, it prefers to pick an unpredictable uniqueness question if present. If such a question is not present, the query generator picks an existence question such that it will lead to a uniqueness question with a high probability in the future. Thus the query generator performs a look-ahead search in this case. = Story line = An integral part of the ultimate aim of building systems that can understand images the way humans do, is the story line. Humans try to figure out a story line in the Image they see. The query generator achieves this by a continuity in the question sequences. This means that once the object has been instantiated it tries to explore it in more details. Apart from finding its attributes and relation to the other objects, localisation is also an important step. Thus, as a next step the query generator tries to localise the object in the region it was first identified, so it restricts the set of instantiation questions to the regions within the original region. = Simplicity preference = Simplicity preference states that the query generator should pick simpler questions over the more complicated ones. Simpler questions are the ones that have fewer attributes in them. So this gives an ordering to the questions based on the number of attributes, and the query generator prefers the simpler ones.  Estimating predictability  To select the next question in the sequence, VTT has to estimate the predictability of every proposed question. This is done using the annotated training set of Images. Each Image is annotated with bounding box around the objects and labelled with the attributes, and pairs of objects are labelled with the relations. Consider each question type separately: # Instantiation questions: The conditional probability estimator for instantiation questions can be represented as: \\\\quad\\\\widehat{P}(X_q = 1) = \\\\frac{\\\\\\\\#\\\\\\\\{I \\\\in T, H(I) = 1, X_q(I) = 1\\\\\\\\}}{\\\\\\\\#\\\\\\\\{I \\\\in T, H(I) = 1\\\\\\\\}} The question is only considered if the denominator is at least 80 images. The condition of H(I) = 1 is very strict and may not be true for a large number of Images, as every question in the history eliminates approximately half of the candidates (Images in this case). As a result, the history is pruned and the questions which may not alter the conditional probability are eliminated. Having a shorter history lets us consider a larger number of Images for the probability estimation. The history pruning is done in two stages: #*In the first stage all the attribute and relationship questions are removed, under the assumption that the presence and instantiation of objects only depends on other objects and not their attributes or relations. Also, all the existence questions referring to regions disjoint from the region being referred to in the proposed question, are dropped with the assumption being that the probability of the presence of an object at a location w does not change with the presence or absence of objects at locations other than w. And finally all the uniqueness questions with a negative response referring to regions disjointed from the region being referred to in the proposed question, are dropped with the assumption that the uniqueness questions with a positive response if dropped can alter the response of the future instantiation questions. The history of questions obtained after this first stage of pruning can be referred to as H_q'. #*In the second stage an image-by-image pruning is performed. Let q_i be a uniqueness question in H that has not been pruned and is preserved in H_q'. If this question is in context of a region which is disjoint from the region being referenced in the proposed question, then the expected answer to this question will be 1, because of the constraints in the first stage. But if the actual answer to this question for the training image is 0, then that training image is not considered for the probability estimation, and the question q_i is also dropped. The final history of questions after this is \\\\tilde{H}(q,I), and the probability is given by: \\\\quad\\\\widehat{P}(X_q = 1) = \\\\frac{\\\\\\\\#\\\\\\\\{I \\\\in T, \\\\tilde{H}(q,I) = 1, X_q(I) = 1\\\\\\\\}}{\\\\\\\\#\\\\\\\\{I \\\\in T, \\\\tilde{H}(q,I) = 1\\\\\\\\}} #Attribute questions: The probability estimator for attribute questions is dependent on the number of labeled objects rather than the images unlike the instantiation questions. Consider an attribute question of the form : ‚ÄòDoes object ot have attribute a?‚Äô, where o_t is an object of type t and a \\\\in A_t. Let A be the set of attributes already known to belong to o_t because of the history. Let \\\\mathcal{O}_\\\\mathbb{T} be the set of all the annotated objects (ground truth) in the training set, and for each o \\\\in \\\\mathcal{O}_\\\\mathbb{T}, let \\\\mathcal{T}_\\\\mathbb{T}(o) be the type of object, and \\\\mathcal{A}_\\\\mathbb{T}(o) be the set of attributes belonging to o. Then the estimator is given by: \\\\quad P(X_q = 1) = \\\\frac{\\\\\\\\#\\\\\\\\{o \\\\in \\\\mathcal{O}_\\\\mathbb{T} : \\\\mathcal{T}_\\\\mathbb{T}(o) = t, A \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{a\\\\\\\\} \\\\subseteq \\\\mathcal{A}_\\\\mathbb{T}(o)\\\\\\\\}}{\\\\\\\\#\\\\\\\\{o \\\\in \\\\mathcal{O}_\\\\mathbb{T} : \\\\mathcal{T}_\\\\mathbb{T}(o) = t, A \\\\subseteq \\\\mathcal{A}_\\\\mathbb{T}(o)\\\\\\\\}} This is basically the ratio of the number of times the object o of type t with attributes A \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{a\\\\\\\\} occurs in the training data, to the number of times the object o of type t with attributes A occurs in the training data. A high number of attributes in A leads to a sparsity problem similar to the instantiation questions. To deal with it we partition the attributes into subsets that are approximately independent conditioned on belonging to the object o_t. For e.g. for t={}person, attributes like crossing a street and standing still are not independent, but both are fairly independent of the sex of the person, whether the person is child or adult, and whether they are carrying something or not. These conditional independencies reduce the size of the set A, and thereby overcome the problem of sparsity. #Relationship questions: The approach for relationship questions is the same as the attribute questions, where instead of the number of objects, number of pair of objects is considered and for the independence assumption, the relationships that are independent of the attributes of the related objects and the relationships that are independent of each other are included.  Example  Detailed example sequences can be found here.  Dataset  The Images considered for the Geman et al. work are that of ‚ÄòUrban street scenes‚Äô dataset, which has scenes of streets from different cities across the world. This why the types of objects are constrained to people and vehicles for this experiment. 330x330px Another dataset introduced by the Max Planck Institute for Informatics is known as DAQUAR dataset which has real world images of indoor scenes. But they propose a different version of the visual Turing test which takes on a holistic approach and expects the participating system to exhibit human like common sense. 330x330px  Conclusion  This is a very recent work published on March 9, 2015, in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, by researchers from Brown University and Johns Hopkins University. It evaluates how the computer vision systems understand the Images as compared to humans. Currently the test is written and the interrogator is a machine because having an oral evaluation by a human interrogator gives the humans an undue advantage of being subjective, and also expects real time answers. The Visual Turing Test is expected to give a new direction to the computer vision research. Companies like Google and Facebook are investing millions of dollars into computer vision research, and are trying to build systems that closely resemble the human visual system. Recently Facebook announced its new platform M, which looks at an image and provides a description of it to help the visually impaired. Such systems might be able to perform well on the VTT.

It was designed by F H Faircloth and built from 1897 to 1909. It is also known as Corinthian Lodge. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 April 2000.  History  The Isis Masonic Lodge in Childers is a two-storey timber building constructed in two stages, the first in 1897 and the second in 1909, to the design of Bundaberg architect Frederick Herbert Faircloth. Located in Macrossan Street, a block behind the main street of Childers, the building survived a major fire in the town in 1902 and remains as one of the oldest buildings in the town. In the 1870s timber cutters were the first European settlers to come to the area surrounding Childers, attracted by large quantities of hoop pine, red cedar and other timbers. The town was established during the 1880s after the land in the nearby area was surveyed into farm blocks in 1882. There was no official town survey and Childers developed following the private subdivision of portions 870 and 871, at the railhead of the 1887 Isis railway line from Isis Junction. On 31 December 1886, the Isis Divisional Board was proclaimed and the extension of the railway to Childers in 1887 provided further impetus for the development of the town. The Freemasonry movement was an integral part of community life in the 19th century and the establishment of a Lodge was a local event representing progress and consolidation of the community. The first meeting of Freemasons in the Childers district took place in 1894 and was called by Constable Richard Henderson and Thomas Gaydon, a local chemist. Early members came from all three constitutions of the time, the English, Scottish and Irish and a vote was taken at a second meeting in January 1895 which resolved to establish a Lodge under the English constitution. This was achieved in April of the same year with the inauguration of the Corinthian Lodge No. 2573 EC. There were 14 founding members and the Master was Worshipful Brother Robert Henry Blisset who had been master of the Star of the East Lodge in Maryborough. The opening ceremony and consecration of the Corinthian Lodge took place in the Isis Divisional Board's Office on 4 April 1895. Subsequent lodge meetings were held in the Childers schoolroom, with furniture and regalia provided by sponsor Lodges in Maryborough and Bundaberg. Members paid a joining fee of for members of English Constitution Lodges and for members of other constitutions, a portion of which went towards a building fund. A hall committee was formed in July 1896 and the land in Macrossan Street was purchased in April 1897 upon this committee's recommendation, at a cost of . Members of the lodge cleared the land and donated money and goods towards the new hall. A single storey timber hall was proposed and funding was provided in the form of a loan from Wor. Bro. Blissett who matched the interest rates offered by the Bank of North Queensland. Bundaberg architect F Herbert Faircloth was commissioned to provide plans in 1897. Herbert Faircloth was responsible for the design of a large number of buildings in Childers, particularly after a disastrous fire destroyed most of the main street in March 1902. Born in Maryborough in 1870, Faircloth was articled to the German-trained Bundaberg architect Anton Hettrich and practised for most of his life in Bundaberg, designing many of the town's major buildings. The first Lodge meeting was held in the new hall on 8 October 1897. By 1908 it became apparent that the hall was not big enough and Faircloth was again approached to provide plans for an additional storey to the hall. JE Sharpe's tender of was accepted and the enlarged hall was consecrated on 9 July 1909. Two storey halls were a popular form for Lodges in Queensland - the upper floor would be reserved for Lodge meetings and the lower floor provided space for a range of public events, such as dances, euchre and smoke nights, picnics and sports days. Founded on principles of fellowship, charity and \\"the practice of moral and social virtue\\" , Freemasonry thrived in the absence of Government welfare and Freemasons supported each other and their families, particularly in country areas. In 1920, the two Grand Lodges of Queensland merged to form the United Grand Lodge of Queensland, ending years of division within the Freemasonry movement in Queensland. As a consequence, the name of the Corinthian Masonic Lodge in Childers was changed to its current name - the Isis No. 93 UGLQ first appearing in the minutes of 11 November 1921. Minor alterations have taken place over the years, including the installation of electricity in 1915, replacement of weatherboards in 1956 and re-wiring, re-stumping and replacement of the corrugated iron roof in 1976. A kitchen and toilet have been added to the rear of the building. The building has been used continuously as a Masonic Lodge since its construction.  Description  Isis Masonic Lodge, 2008 The Isis Masonic Lodge is a tall rectilinear timber building whose form and simplicity creates a striking presence in Macrossan Street, Childers. Located in a residential setting, the site is grassed and slopes away from road level with a ramp and handrail defining access to the building. Two thin pencil pines Cupressus semperzirens on either side of the entry ramp are the only plantings on the site. The building is two storey and raised on concrete and timber stumps, with an ornate facade whose parapet covers the gable end of the shallow, pitched roof. The facade is the most characteristic aspect of the building. Painted in blue and white, the colours of Freemasonry, the front stands out starkly against the undecorated sides and back of the building. The front elevation is symmetrically composed around a central entrance which consists of doorways and a porch. The porch has a gable roof at the upper level, supported on timber posts with a decorative wrought iron balustrade to the balcony which is accessed via French doors. The porch is supported at ground level by timber Tuscan columns surmounted by a simple entablature bearing the name of the Lodge and a sign commemorating its centenary. The columns are mounted on pedestals. The central entrance consists of a pair of timber doors with a fanlight above and moulded architrave. The doorway is flanked by double hung timber windows on both levels. At upper level, the architrave of these windows takes the form of mini-pilasters supporting a moulded lintel. The front elevation is finished in chamferboards. Pilasters are located at the corners, separated by a protruding string course at first floor level. The upper level pilasters support an entablature and pediment with simple timber mouldings and the symbols of Freemasonry are located within the tympanum. The sides and back of the building are clad in weatherboards with four aluminium framed windows at the upper level and three smaller windows at the lower level. Five small wall vents with iron hoods are located between the windows on the top floor on both sides of the building. The planning of the interior of the building is simple, the front section contains anterooms and a stairwell with the rest of the building occupied by hall-like spaces on both levels. On the ground floor, there is a wide entry hall decorated with framed photographs of early members of the Lodge, the Queen and photographs of the building over time. A door opening leads to a large square room with timber columns located down the centre of the room. The room is lined in horizontal tongue-in-groove boarding. On the eastern wall are small timber display cases which contain a collection of Lodge cards. Two doors at the back of the room lead to a small kitchen and toilet, both lined in fibro-cement boarding with recent aluminium framed windows. A small servery hatch is located in the wall between the kitchen and the hall. A cast iron ladder leading to a hatch to the upper hall which serves as a fire escape is situated in the south-eastern corner of the kitchen. A set of timber stairs outside the toilet in the south-western corner leads to the undercroft space where another toilet is to be found. The staircase is located on the eastern side of the entry space and features a cedar balustrade with turned balusters and substantial newels. The stairwell and anterooms on both levels are lined with horizontal tongue-in-groove boarding, painted with a colour scheme of a dark brown dado, cream walls and white ceilings. Floors are timber. A small storage room is located at the top of the stairs and a narrow landing leads to the main Lodge room which is entered via a door at the eastern side of the building. The main room is lined in horizontal tongue-in-groove boarding painted in tones of blue and white. The floor is carpeted in a strong blue colour with the central feature of a tessallated timber board of black and white squares which was given to the Isis Lodge when the Tiaro Lodge was closed down. Furniture and regalia is unfixed and includes bench seating, a number of ornate timber chairs and several staves. The ceiling has a number of decorative ceiling roses.  Heritage listing  The Isis Masonic Lodge was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 April 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Isis Masonic Lodge is important in illustrating the evolution of Queensland's history having been constructed during a period of unprecedented growth in the Isis, when Childers emerged as the centre of a substantial sugar-growing district and major social, cultural and religious institutions were established in the town. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. As a two-storey, timber hall with an impressive facade with decorative timber detailing and blue and white colour scheme, the Isis Masonic Hall demonstrates the principal characteristics of Masonic Temples in small rural settlements.

Early life  Anne Garc√≠a-Romero was born to a mother of English, Irish and German descent and a father from Spain. Her hometown is Wellesley, MA and she currently lives in South Bend, Indiana. Her work has been greatly influenced by her ethnic and cultural background, as many of her plays deal with issues affecting both White and Latino communities. In her work, she tries to bridge the gap between these two communities. She translates plays from Spanish to English, to make different works accessible to different communities and has written many plays about Latino experiences, while making it accessible to larger audiences. Garc√≠a-Romero received her B.A. at Occidental College and then went on to the Yale School of Drama, where she received her Masters in Fine Arts majoring in playwriting. She completed her Ph.D. at UC Santa Barbara, where she majored in Theater Studies. Garc√≠a-Romero is also an alumna of New Dramatists in New York City, which is an organization that specifically supports and provides resources to talented playwrights.  Career  Garc√≠a- Romero has taught at universities such as University of Southern California, California Institute of the Arts, Loyola Marymount University, Macalester College and Wesleyan University. She currently teaches at The University of Notre Dame. Some of the courses that she teaches are Playwriting, Script Analysis, and Story Structure. Garc√≠a-Romero has written eight major full- length plays, her most popular are Juanita‚Äôs Statue, Paloma, Earthquake Chica, Provenance. Her plays have been presented in prestigious theaters all over the country. These theaters include, but are not limited to, the New York Shakespeare Festival with The Public Theater, INTAR, The Mark Taper Forum, Borderlands Theater, East L.A. Repertory, Jungle Theater, and National Hispanic Cultural Center. She has also written three short-length plays, which have garnered her much recognition as well. Garc√≠a-Romero's work has been the National Latino Playwriting Award runner-up as well as a National Latino Playwriting Award finalist. She has also had work that was a part of the Eugene O‚ÄôNeill National Playwrights Conference. Garc√≠a-Romero has also published a book which has a selection of her plays. The book is titled, Anne Garc√≠a-Romero: Collected Plays. The plays that are included in the book are, Santa Concepci√≥n, Earthquake Chica, and Mary Peabody in Cuba. Latino playwright Octavio Solis said, about her plays in this book, ‚ÄúAnne writes the stories we had always known by heart but had forgotten. With a purity at once spare and rich, she creates characters we not only feel we have broken bread with, but who have been in our dreams and crises.‚Äù Much of her work focuses heavily on narratives of Latinidad. She has written plays about Mexicans, Cubans, Spanish folks as well as White folks of different ethnicities. Anne Garc√≠a-Romero works with the organization HowlRound and their Latina/o Theatre Commons. This includes a large network of other Latina/o artists, and has brought them together to discuss what is best for the Latina/o Theater community at large. Garc√≠a-Romero has written essays for their journal, Caf√© Onda. In one of her essays, she writes, ‚ÄúUS culture in the twenty-first century continues to move from a mono-cultural to a multi-cultural experience. However, US theatre currently does not always reflect this reality and therefore can perpetuate an outdated narrative.‚Äù Much of Anne Garc√≠a-Romero's work is to counter these mainstream, stereotypical, dominant narratives through a retelling of what it really means to be a Latina/o in the United States.

Garcia-Romero creates an archive of five contemporary Latina playwrights‚ÄîCaridad Svich, Karen Zachar√≠as, Elaine Romero, Cusi Cram, and Quiara Alegr√≠a Hudes‚Äîwriting a chapter on each, touching on themes in their major works, and mapping them into a genealogy of Latina theatre helmed by Fornes.https://muse.jhu.edu/issue/40773 Garia-Romero's work explores how Latina playwrights began to find their footing in the American theatre in the 1960s through the work of Maria Irene Fornes. Garcia-Romero builds upon prior of studies about Fornes‚Äô work, such as Forn√©s: Theater in the Present Tense by Diana Lynn Moroff (1996) and Conducting a Life: Reflections on the Life of Mar√≠a Irene Forn√©s edited by Maria Delgado and Caridad Svich (1999).https://muse.jhu.edu/issue/35175 Focusing on transnational ideas of Latinidad instead of focusing on one ethnic identity, Garcia-Romero has chosen these five Latina playwrights because each originates from a different Latina background (whether ethnic, social, or geographical). The first chapter focuses on Fornes herself and serves to contextualize Fornes within Latina theatre. It offers biographical information in addition to contextualizing her artistic and pedagogical styles. Garcia-Romero asserts that there are four cultural themes which link each playwright to the legacy of Fornes‚Äô work and to the larger body of Latina theatre: cultural multiplicity, supernatural interventions, Latina identity, and theatrical experimentation. Garcia-Romero theorizes three waves of playwrights that studied with Fornes. The first wave began in the 1980s with playwrights like Cherrie Moraga and Milcha Sanchez- Scott. The second wave includes playwrights Migdalia Cruz and Carmelita Tropicana. The third wave began in the 1990s and continues through the present. The Fornes Frame is a tribute to the late playwright. Garcia-Romero‚Äôs work updates the narrative about Fornes, a foundational US playwright. Garcia- Romero demonstrates how contemporary playwrights are actively involved in conversations about identity.

Dr. Schuller is an official editor of the Dead Sea Scrolls. She teaches undergraduate and graduate studies in the Biblical field. Over a span of 30 years, her involvement in the publication of the Dead Sea Scrolls has led to numerous contributions in authenticating the discoveries found in the caves near the Ancient Qumran settlement.  Education Schuller's interest in religious studies started at an early age when she attended St. Mary's high school in Edmonton and joined the Ursuline Sisters of Chatham, Ont. whom were known for their prestigious curriculum and devotion to teaching. Her decision to become a sister was one she feels conflicted on. In an article written in honor of Schuller being appointed to the Royal Society of Canada in the division of Humanities, Lasha Morningstar from the Western Catholic Reporter quotes Schuller in response to her strong call to teach. \\"The heart\\", said Schuller \\"has its reasons for the heart to speak. There was a sense of call to serve the Church through teaching and study. There has always been a place in the Church that sees this as a ministry. It has developed in different ways over my life. I spent about 12 years of my life teaching in a seminary situation in Edmonton and Halifax and felt a great call to that. And I've appreciated working in the public university setting.\\" In 1970, she attended the University of Alberta where she graduated with a bachelor of arts degree with honors in the Department of Classics. Three years later, she pursued a master of arts degree in the Department of Near Eastern Studies from the University of Toronto. In 1984, she received her Ph.D from Harvard University in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations.  Career After completing her undergraduate studies, she worked as a lecturer at Newman Theological College and St. Joseph's College in Edmonton from 1973-1977. At the Atlantic School of Theology in Halifax, she began as an assistant professor from 1982 to 1986 and then taught as an associate professor from 1986 to 1989. Lasha Morningstar notes that Archbishop Richard Smith was one of her students. After earning her Doctorate, she went on to teaching at McMaster University in 1990. For two years she taught as a tenure-track stream professor and from 1992 to 1996 she taught as a tenured, associate professor.

Published in 2000, a book titled \\"Prayer and Poetry in the Dead Sea Scrolls\\" is a collection of articles that was presented at a conference in honor of Dr. Schuller's 65th birthday. This volume reflects the state of research in the field and offers new insights into topics which Dr. Schuller has written.  Scholarly and professional involvement  Over time, working on the scrolls had given Schuller a deeper appreciation of the Jewish world in which Jesus had lived. Not only did she get the chance to live in Israel, where some of the scrolls and fragments of the scrolls are kept to showcase and study, but through studying ancient Judaism, she was able to discover why there was a separation between Christians and Jews and also how they can connect and interact with one another. Since 2007, she has been a part of various Advisory Boards, namely, of the Centre for the Study of Dead Sea Scrolls in the Context of Early Judaism and Early Christianity at Copenhagen University, and the Advisory Board of Theologisches W√∂rterbuch zu den Qumrantexten and Biblischen Notizen.

It was designed by Philip Oliver Ellard Hawkes and built in 1919. It is also known as Childers Travel World, Wrench & Cobb, and Ye Olde Boutique. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The former Queensland National Bank is a masonry building in the main street of Childers and was the second building used by this bank on this site. It was erected in 1919 to the design of Maryborough architect POE Hawkes. The Queensland National Bank was the first and most successful of Queensland's three indigenous 19th century banks. It was established in March 1872 by a group of prominent Queensland squatters, politicians, lawyers, and businessmen who wished to secure development capital free from overseas or intercolonial control. Its first office was established in Queen Street, Brisbane in that year and the bank attracted widespread Queensland patronage. In 1879 it secured the whole of the Queensland Government's banking business. By 1880 it held 40% of deposits in the colony and dominated the Queensland economy. This was not, however, the first bank established in Childers, the Bank of North Queensland and the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney both being present in the 1890s and erecting premises in the newly emerging sugar town in 1900. Following logging of the dense Isis Scrub in the 1870s, Childers, in the heart of the scrub, was promoted by Maryborough interests in the 1880s as an agricultural district. The land in the immediate vicinity of the present town was surveyed in 1882 into farm blocks. There was no official town survey and Childers developed following private subdivision at the railhead of the 1887 Isis railway line from Isis Junction. This was opened on 31 October 1887, and was intended principally to facilitate the transport of timber from the scrub. The coming of the railway not only promoted the development of the town of Childers; it also provided the catalyst for the establishment of a sugar industry in the district. At the opening of the railway to Childers, Robert Cran, owner of Maryborough's Yengarie mill, announced that he would erect a double crushing juice mill at Doolbi, to supply his mill at Yengarie, completed in 1890. Further expansion of the sugar industry in the Isis was closely related to the activities of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which erected a central crushing mill in the district 1893-94, and began crushing in 1895. By this time, at least three other mills had been established in the Isis, with another two under construction, and Childers had emerged as the centre of a substantial sugar-growing district. In 1903 the old Isis Divisional Board (1886) was abolished and Isis Shire proclaimed, with the new seat of municipal government moving from Howard to Childers. left left Whilst Queensland in general was slow to recover from the depression of the early 1890s and the 1893 banking crisis, the growth of commerce in Childers was attractive to banking institutions contemplating expansion. The Queensland National Bank initially rented a timber commercial building on this site, together with an adjacent timber house as a residence for the bank manager and opened for business on 9 July 1900. In 1909 they purchased this property and in 1919 erected a new and more prestigious building to the design of Maryborough architect, POE Hawkes. An undated floor plan in the archives of the National Australia Bank (the ultimate successor to the Queensland National Bank) shows what appears to be the current building. It has counters surrounding a public area, a room for clerical use behind them, a specially reinforced strong room, a manager's room and a bathroom and bedroom for the bank officer to the rear. The bank was constructed by a Mr Steffensen at a cost of and the previous building was sold for removal. Architect Philip Oliver Ellard Hawkes was born in 1882 in New South Wales and worked in Perth, Launceston and Melbourne. Moving to Queensland, he worked briefly for the Works Department in 1909 before setting up his own practice in Bundaberg and Maryborough in 1910. He designed a number of premises for the QN Bank: most of these were simple timber buildings, although the Kingaroy branch was a two storey masonry building, also in a classical revival style. This also featured round headed arches as do the Carroll Cottage and Carrollee Hotel in Kingaroy, which were also designed by Hawkes. In 1943, a wartime rationalisation of branches in smaller centres resulted in the Commercial Banking Company and the Queensland National Bank closing their Childers branches. The QN branch closed on 18 January 1943 and the property was purchased by Wrench and Copp, an accounting firm. It was probably then that the bank counters were removed and a further small office built into the corner of the former banking chamber. In 1948, the QN Bank merged with the National Bank of Australasia, later the National Australia Bank, who already had premises on the opposite side of Churchill Street. In 1973 the former QN Bank building was purchased by the current owners who and operated it for many years as a clothing shop called Ye Olde Boutique. It is later became a real estate agency and travel agency. In 2015, it is being used by a medical practitioner.  Description  The former Queensland National Bank building is single story rendered brick building designed to fit an irregularly shaped corner block on the main street of Childers. It has a hipped roof concealed by a stepped parapet and an imposing, classically influenced street elevation. This is separated into bays by pilasters and features a heavy triangular pediment above an arched entrance flanked by a pair of matching arched windows. The upper section of the wall is finished with rough cast render. The entrance doors appear to be original, having a pair of semicircular glass panes echoing the arches of door and windows and large brass and timber handles. The elevation to Ashby Lane is very plain with a parapet which conceals the roof and slopes away to the rear. It has two sash windows shaded by sun hoods, as does the other side which now faces the ANZ bank across a narrow laneway. The interior of the building has timber ceilings and plastered walls. It retains the main features of the original layout including the manager's office, a strong room and part of the teller's counter and cash drawers. A further office has been constructed in the corner of the former banking chamber. A small hall leads into the former bedroom which has been divided by a partition wall into a kitchen and store, possibly in the 1970s. The bank building itself is very close to its original appearance in form and interior layout; however, a large modern concrete block building has been constructed to its rear and is connected to it by a passageway.  Heritage listing  The former Queensland National Bank building in Childers was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Queensland National Bank building is important in illustrating the development of Queensland because it was purpose built as premises for a bank formed to serve Queensland interests and needs when the state was a self-governing colony. The quality of its design and construction also demonstrate the importance of this regional branch at a time when Childers had established itself as the flourishing centre of a substantial sugar-growing district. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. It is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a regional bank of its era, from the reassuring conservatism of the classically influenced design, to the layout which provided a reinforced strongroom and allowed for staff accommodation. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. As a well designed and detailed building it contributes to the picturesque townscape of Churchill Street which is both remarkably architecturally coherent and intact. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. It has a special association with the life and work of Maryborough architect POE Hawkes, who designed a number of banks for the Queensland National Bank, of which this is one of the most substantial. It is also associated with the development of the QN Bank, the earliest of Queensland's indigenous banks.

History  Manny Ohonme was born and raised in Lagos, Nigeria. After winning a contest put on by Christian missionaries from Wisconsin, he earned himself \\"his first ever pair of shoes\\" at 9 years of age, as well hope and inspiration for his future. With both of these new possessions, he honed his skills in basketball to be recruited to play on a full athletic scholarship in America at the University of North Dakota- Lake Region for the men's basketball team, allowing him to earn both his bachelor's and master's degrees. After years of success in America's technology sector, he returned home to Nigeria and was moved after seeing many children living without shoes. In 2003, he and his wife Tracie formed Samaritan's Feet. Since then, Samaritan's Feet has achieved an overall Four Star ranking from Charity Navigator, the highest ranking possible. 97.5% of the organization's expenses go towards distributing shoes worldwide, with 1.2% being reserved for fundraising efforts and 1.1% being reserved for administrative salaries. The organization saw a significant increase in revenue during 2013 and was able to cover all expenses for the year for the first time in at least four years.

Personal life  Fern√°ndez is a second generation Mexican-American and a prominent figure in the Latino/a theater and film community. Fern√°ndez's grandparents immigrated to the United States in 1910 from Jalisco, Mexico, to escape civil war. Fern√°ndez was born in 1954 Los Angeles but lived the first 9 years of her life in Arizona before moving back to LA to live with her grandparents after her parents got divorced. Fern√°ndez had an interest in writing her whole life but first got involved in drama in the Garfield High School Drama Club. She then attended California State University Los Angeles, where she continued to pursue theater and became involved in the Chicano Movement. Evelina was a founding member of the Latino Theatre Company (LTC) in 1985. She has remained involved for 30 years, writing several and performing in a dozen plays for the LTC. Fernandez is married to the Artistic Director and one of the founders of the Latino Theater Company, Jose Luis Valenzuela. Jose has directed many of the plays that Evelina has written and starred in. The LTC currently has a 20-year lease with the City of Los Angeles to operate in the Los Angeles Theater Center (LATC). Valenzuela and Fern√°ndez have two children and live in Los Angeles.  Career  Her first prominent role as an actress came in Luis Valdez's Zootsuit in 1978. The play was the first play with a Chicano to be shown on Broadway however, Fern√°ndez was pregnant with her first child, Fidel, and could not perform in the Broadway production. After Zootsuit, Fern√°ndez performed for El Teatro de Esperanza, performing at both the New York Shakespeare Festival and Denver Center for the Performing Arts. Fern√°ndez then performed as Julie in American Me, a film about Chicano gang life and the prison system in the United States. She has since appeared as an actress in 28 movies, shows and film shorts. A theme of her work is to fight the common representation of Latino/a characters as victims. Her frustration with the portrayal of Latino/a characters prompted her to write Luminarias, released in May 2000. Luminarias is a commentary about race, sex and love from the perspective of single, chicana women. In addition to writing Luminarias, Fern√°ndez also produced and starred in the film as the actress of one of the protagonists, Andrea. Luminarias was a groundbreaking film because it was written, funded, acted and directed by the Latino community. Fern√°ndez wrote a loosely autobiographical trilogy called A Mexican Trilogy, which were put on at the LATC by the LTC. The Trilogy is made up of Faith, Hope and Charity . The titles were intended to be the names of the protagonists but in the end, were the themes of each of the play. The trilogy highlights the immigrant experience. According to Fern√°ndez, one of the aims of the play is to highlight immigrant's contributions to American History.  Awards  Fern√°ndez has received several awards for her work. In 1998, she won the American Latino Media Arts Award for her work in the movie Hollywood Confidential. In 2007 she was nominated for the Humanitas Prize for her work on an episode of the T.V. series Maya and Miguel. In 2000, the year that Luminarias was released, Fern√°ndez won the Nosotros Golden Eagle Awards for Outstanding Writer. Two of her works, Solitude and Dementia have made the Los Angeles Times Critic's Choice list. Evelina has received 2 Ted Schmitt Awards from The Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle for the world premiere of an outstanding new play for her plays, A Mexican Trilogy: An American Story and The Mother of Henry.

After returning to Iowa in 2018, the Cubs promoted Mills to start his first MLB game for injured Tyler Chatwood against the Cincinnati Reds on August 24, 2018. He also got his first hit in the same game. Mills joined the Cubs rotation in the 2020 season after Jos√© Quintana began the season on the injured list. On September 13, 2020, Mills no-hit the Milwaukee Brewers 12‚Äì0 at Miller Park. He threw 74 of 114 pitches for strikes while striking out five and walking three. It marked the 16th no-hitter in the Cubs franchise history. Mills finished the 2020 season with a 5‚Äì5 record and a 4.48 ERA.

She is sometimes referred to as the \\"mother of ecology.\\"In 2003, she was the subject of a documentary called \\"Rose Gaffney: The Belle of Bodega Bay.\\" Early life The daughter of Polish immigrants, Rose Gaffney came to Bodega Bay at the age of 16. With only an eighth grade education, she rode the trains down from Canada to work for the man who later became her husband. Her husband died in 1941, leaving Gaffney to inherit property on Bodega Head that her father in-law purchased in 1863. Bodega Head Gaffney owned 482 acres on Bodega Head, a strip of land jutting off from the California coast into the Pacific Ocean to form Bodega Bay. The narrow ridge of Bodega Head rests on the Pacific plate, while but the nearby town itself is on the North American plate. The fault can shift violently. During the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, land close to the Head moved as much as 15 feet. Tremors are frequent. In 1958, Joel Hedgpeth, director of the University of Pacific Marine Station at Dillon Beach, began raising cautions regarding both earthquake safety and marine wildlife health that would be affected by warm water effluent. In 1958, when Gaffney was 66, PG&E; proposed building a nuclear power plant on the tip of Bodega Head, virtually on top of the San Andreas Fault. Gaffney responded by inviting geologists, including Dr. Pierre St. Amand, who had studied the effects of the 1960 Valdivia earthquake in Chile,, at 9.4-9.6 on the moment magnitude scale, the largest ever recorded, as well as government inspectors, to visit the land and observe the actual visible fault lines. St. Amand's report stated that he couldn‚Äôt imagine a worse spot for a reactor. Gaffney said that PG&E; confided their plans to her, and it did not want the public to become aware of their intentions.Nuclear Fault Line ‚Äì Bodega Head, Sonoma Magazine, James Daly, February 2015. Retrieved October 1, 2020. Although, according to Gaffney, other property owners in the area sold to PG&E; \\"without hesitation,\\" she refused to sell to the utility. Intending rather to sell her property to the state or the University of California Gaffney sued the utility to keep her property from them and prevent the nuclear power plant construction. This drew national attention and helped to launch a grassroots environmental movement. Gaffney was successful. PG&E; finally gave up on the project in 1964. Gaffney had been forced to sell part of her property to PG&E;, but sold the rest of it to the University of California and the California State Parks system for more, she said, than she was willing to take for it.Rose Gaffney (1895 to 1974) An Original from Bodega Bay, Rancho Bodega Historical Society, Robin Rudderow, Fall 2018. Retrieved October 1, 2020. Legacy After the Bodega Bay Nuclear Power Plant proposal failed, the exploratory hole dug for the proposed plant filled with water. It has since been nicknamed \\"The Hole in the Head\\". Gaffney sold 90 acres of land to the California Beaches and Parks Department, and another 327 acres to the University of California, where the Bodega Marine Research Lab was established. Gaffney died in 1979. She was called the \\"Mother of Ecology\\" by the Los Angeles Times in 1971.

First introduced in his book Colours of Love: An Exploration of the Ways of Loving (1973), Lee defines three primary, three secondary and nine tertiary love styles, describing them in terms of the traditional color wheel. The three primary types are eros, ludus and storge, and the three secondary types are mania, pragma and agape.  Primary types of love/sex = Eros  Eros is the Greek term for romantic, passionate or sexual love, from which we derive the term \\"erotic\\". Lee describes eros as a passionate physical and emotional love of wanting to satisfy, create sexual contentment, security and aesthetic enjoyment for each other, it also includes creating sexual security for the other by striving to forsake options of sharing one's intimate and sexual self with outsiders. It is a highly sensual, intense, passionate style of love. Erotic lovers choose their lovers by intuition or \\"chemistry.\\" They are more likely to say they fell in love at first sight than those of other love styles. Erotic lovers view marriage as an extended honeymoon, and sex as the ultimate aesthetic experience. They tend to address their lovers with pet names, such as \\"sweetie\\" or \\"sexy\\". An erotic lover can be perceived as a \\"hopeless romantic\\". The erotic lover wants to share everything with and know everything about their loved one, and often thinks of their partner in an idealized manner. The erotic lover's reaction to criticism from their partner is one of hurt and intense pain. The erotic lover's reaction to separation from the partner is agony and despair. Those of other love styles may see erotic lovers as unrealistic, or trapped in a fantasy. The advantage of erotic love, is that the hormones and emotions cause lovers to bond with each other, and feelings of lust and feelings of love alternatively reinforce each other. It is very relaxing for the person doing it. It affords a sense of security to both partners who recognize and see sexual complementation in each other and a sense of life's purpose. Sexual contentment lies at the bottom of Maslow's hierarchy of needs along with hunger and shelter. It requires both partners to accord validity to each other's sexual feelings, work on sustaining interest and maintain the sexual health of the relationship. A disadvantage is the possibility of the decay in attraction, and the danger of living in a fantasy world. In its extreme, eros can resemble na√Øvet√©. A partner not as sexually inclined may also feel one's physical body being taken for granted and may perceive the eros lover as looking for carnal gratification. Examples of eros may be seen in movies including The Blue Lagoon, Return to the Blue Lagoon, Pretty Woman, Working Girl, and Girl with a Pearl Earring. Lee's recognizable traits: * Feels strong physical and emotional connection through the relationship * Begins with a partner who is a stranger and evokes immediate excitement * May be exclusive but not possessive * Seeks early sexual adventure, variety and technique * Is ready for love and its risks  Ludus  Ludus means \\"game\\" or ‚Äúschool‚Äù in Latin. Lee uses the term to describe those who see love as a desiring to want to have fun with each other, to do activities indoor and outdoor, tease, indulge, and play harmless pranks on each other. The acquisition of love and attention itself may be part of the game. Ludic lovers want to have as much fun as possible. When they are not seeking a stable relationship, they rarely or never become overly involved with one partner and often can have more than one partner at a time, in other words a school of partners. They don't reveal their true thoughts and feelings to their partner(s), especially if they think they can gain some kind of advantage over their partner(s). The expectation may also be that the partner(s) should also be similarly minded. If a relationship materializes it will be about having fun and indulging in activities of varying degrees of learnedness together. This love style carries the likelihood of infidelity. In its most extreme form, ludic love can become sexual addiction. Examples of ludus in movies include Dangerous Liaisons, Cruel Intentions, and Kids.  Storge  Storge is the Greek term for familial love. Lee defines Storge as growing slowly out of friendship and is based more on similar interests and a commitment to one another rather than on passion. However, he chooses Storge, rather than the term Philia (the usual term for friendship) to describe this kind of love. There is a love between siblings, spouses, cousins, parents and children. Storge necessitates certain familial loyalties, responsibilities, duties and entitlements. The dwelling is to be sanctuary for its members and all members of a family are to pull through together in difficult times. Except for marriage, all other relationships have existed often by blood for as long as the individuals have known each other. In marriage, a couple, who formerly did not accord each other this love, promise to extend and build this love and form a new bond of kinship. Family members hold each other in good esteem to the outside world. Insults undermine the connected family reputations. In many judicial systems a family member cannot be asked to testify in court against a member of one's immediate family for a crime external to family. Storgic love often develops gradually out of friendship, or out of extended duration of cohabitation. The friendship in some cases can endure beyond the breakup of the relationship. Examples of storge can be seen in movies including Love & Basketball, When Harry Met Sally..., and Zack and Miri Make a Porno. Lee's recognizable traits: * Is not looking for love but is ready if encountered * Quietly possessive but not overly jealous * Believes love comes from friendship but not a goal of life * Only has sexual desires after commitment is declared  Secondary types of love  According to Lee's color wheel theory, there are three secondary types of love: mania, agape, and pragma.  Mania  Mania is derived from the Greek term ŒºŒ±ŒΩŒØŒ±, meaning \\"mental disorder\\", from which the term \\"manic\\" is derived. Lee defines manic love as flowing out of a desire to hold one's partner in high esteem and wanting to love and be loved in this way, seeing specialness in the interaction. This type of love tends to lead a partner into a type of madness and obsessiveness. On the color wheel, it is represented by the color purple, since it is a mix between ludus and eros. Manic lovers speak of their partners with possessives and superlatives, and they feel that they \\"need\\" their partners. This kind of love is expressed as a means of rescue, or a reinforcement of value. Manic lovers value finding a partner through chance without prior knowledge of their financial status, education, background, or personality traits. Insufficient expression of manic love by one's partner can cause one to perceive the partner as aloof, materialistic and detached. In excess, mania becomes obsession or codependency, and obsessed manic lovers can thus come across as being very possessive and jealous. One example from real life can be found in the unfortunate case of John Hinckley, Jr., a mentally disturbed individual who attempted to assassinate the incumbent US President Ronald Reagan due to a delusion that this would prompt the actress Jodie Foster to finally reciprocate his obsessive love. Extreme examples of mania in popular culture include yandere anime and manga characters. Additionally, manic love is a central theme in the films Endless Love, Fatal Attraction, Misery, Play Misty for Me, Swimfan, and Taxi Driver. Lee's recognizable traits: * Anxiety about falling in love, with expectations of pain * Quickly becoming overwhelmed by thoughts of one's partner * Forcing a partner into showing affection and emotion * Easily frustrated and does not enjoy sexual intimacy * Possessiveness and jealousy  Agape  Agape is derived from ·ºÄŒ≥Œ¨œÄŒ∑ a Greek term for altruistic love. Lee describes agape as the purest form of love, derives this definition of love from being altruistic towards one's partner and feeling love in the acts of doing so. The person is willing to endure difficulty that arises from the partner's circumstance. It is based on an unbreakable commitment and an unconditional, selfless love, that is all giving. It is an undying love of compassion and selflessness. Agape love is often referenced with religious meaning and is signified by the color orange. Agapic lovers view their partners as blessings and wish to take care of them. The agapic lover gets more pleasure from giving in a relationship than from receiving. They will remain faithful to their partners to avoid causing them pain and often wait patiently for their partners after a break-up. Agape requires one to be forgiving, patient, understanding, loyal, and willing to make sacrifices for their partner. An agapic lover believes that this love is unconditional, though lovers taking an agapic stance to relationships risk suffering from inattention to their own needs. The advantage of agapic love is its generosity. A disadvantage is that it can induce feelings of guilt or incompetence in a partner. There is the potential to be taken advantage of. In its deviant form, agape can become Martyrdom. Martyrdom for principle may be acceptable; martyrdom to maintain a relationship is considered psychologically unhealthy. Examples of agape can be found in books and movies including The Gift of the Magi by O. Henry, Penelope in Homer's Odyssey, The Mission, Somewhere in Time, Titanic, Untamed Heart, Forrest Gump, and the Bible. Lee's recognizable traits: * Attracted to several types of people * Meets people easily so most likely will begin with a stranger * Feels concern and care for each partner they have * Is neither jealous nor obsessive * Enjoys sex and is willing to improve it  Pragma  Pragma comes from the Greek term œÄœÅ·æ∂Œ≥ŒºŒ±, meaning \\"businesslike,\\" from which terms like \\"pragmatic\\" are derived. Lee defines pragma as the most practical type of love, not necessarily derived out of true romantic love. Rather, pragma is a convenient type of love. Pragmatic lovers have a notion of being of service which they perceive to be rational and realistic. While they may be sincere about being useful themselves it also translates to having expectations of a partner and of the relationship. They tend to select and reject partners based on what they perceive as desirable, compatible traits. Pragmatic lovers want to find value in their partners, and ultimately want to work with their partner to reach a common goal. The practicality and realism of pragmatic love often contributes to the longevity of the relationship, as long as common goals and values remain shared for the duration. Excessive thinking along these lines causes a relationship to be seen for its utility or as a trade or exchange. The attitude of a pragmatic relationship can become disdainful and toxic if one partner sees the other as a burden. Emphasis within pragmatic relationships is on earning, affordability, child care, and/or home service. Pragmatic love as a form of cooperation or symbiosis should not be considered negative. In a collectivist culture where arranged marriage is practised, pragmatic love is very common (Chaudhuri, 2004). Values are likely to be shared by a couple in developing countries, where survival and the building of wealth are often prioritized over other pursuits. Examples of pragma can be found in books, movies, and TV including Ordinary People, Pride and Prejudice (Charlotte), Little Women (Amy March and Fred Vaughn) and House of Cards (Frank and Claire Underwood). Political marriages are also considered to be examples of pragmatic love. Lee's recognizable traits: * Certain of their preferable \\"types\\" * Begins a relationship with an already familiar person * Believes a loving relationship is desirable for a happy life * Expects reciprocation of feelings * Believes sexual compatibility can be worked out  Tertiary types of love  Lee defines nine types of tertiary types of love that are combinations of the previous six types of love. Each combination includes one primary and one secondary. # Maniac eros # Maniac ludus # Maniac storge # Agapic eros # Agapic ludus # Agapic storge # Pragmatic eros # Pragmatic ludus # Pragmatic storge Though Lee names each of the tertiary types of love, he never found enough evidence to distinguish them fully. Measurement Clyde Hendrick and Susan Hendrick of Texas Tech University expanded on this theory in the mid-1980s with their extensive research on what they called \\"love styles\\". Their study found that male students tend to be more ludic, whereas female students tend to be storgic and pragmatic. Whilst the ludic love style may predominate in men under age thirty, studies on more mature men have shown that the majority of them do indeed mature into desiring monogamy, marriage and providing for their family by age thirty. Hendrick and Hendrick (1986) developed a self- report questionnaire measure of Lee's love styles, known as the Love Attitudes Scale (LAS). A shortened version of the LAS, presumably for researchers trying to keep their surveys as concise as possible, was later published, and other variations appear to have been used by some researchers. Respondents indicate their level of agreement or disagreement with the LAS items, examples of which include \\"My partner and I have the right physical 'chemistry'\\" (eros) and \\"Our love is the best kind because it grew out of a long friendship\\" (storge). Depending on the version of the LAS one administers, there are from 3‚Äì7 items for each of the six styles described above. A 2002 article illustrated the use of the LAS. Biological view In 2007, researchers from the University of Pavia led by Dr Enzo Emanuele provided evidence of a genetic basis for individual variations in Lee's love styles, with eros being linked to the dopamine system and mania to the serotonin system. In a genetic study of 350 lovers, the eros style was found to be present more often in those bearing the TaqI A1 allele of the DRD2 3' UTR sequence and the overlapping ANKK1 exon 8. This allele has been proposed to influence a wide range of behaviors, favoring obesity and alcoholism but opposing neuroticism-anxiety and juvenile delinquency. This genetic variation has been hypothesized to cause a reduced amount of pleasure to be obtained from a given action, causing people to indulge more frequently.

It was designed by F H Faircloth and built . It is also known as F. Ellwood & Co Drapery, Boys Department Store, Dimmeys, and Joys Hairdress. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The former F. Ellwood and Co Drapery was erected for William Brand and Robert Gant following the 1902 fire that destroyed most of the south side of Churchill Street, the main street of Childers. It may have been designed by Bundaberg architect, FW Faircloth who was responsible for much of the new building following the fire, the effects of which transformed Childers main street from a pioneer frontier township of timber and iron structures to the established centre of the flourishing Isis district with its new more substantial masonry buildings. Following logging of the dense Isis Scrub in the 1870s, Childers, in the heart of the scrub, was promoted in the 1880s by Maryborough interests, as an agricultural district. The land in the immediate vicinity of the present town of Childers was surveyed in 1882 into farm blocks. There was no official town survey; Childers developed following private subdivision at the railhead of the 1887 Isis railway line from Isis Junction. This was opened on 31 October 1887, and was intended principally to facilitate the transport of timber from the scrub. The coming of the railway not only promoted the development of the town of Childers; it also proved the catalyst for the establishment of a sugar industry in the district in the late 1880s. At the opening of the railway to Childers, Robert Cran, owner of Maryborough's Yengarie mill, announced that he would erect a double crushing juice mill at Doolbi, to supply his mill at Yengarie. This was completed in 1890, with the juice being brought in railway tankers from the Isis. Further expansion of the sugar industry in the Isis was closely related to the activities of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which erected a central crushing mill in the district 1893‚Äì94, and began crushing in 1895. By 1895, at least three other mills had been established in the Isis, with another two under construction, and Childers had emerged as the flourishing centre of a substantial sugar-growing district. 1902 was a very dry year and Childers had no fire brigade. On 23 March, a catastrophic fire swept through the south side of the main street in town, where virtually all the buildings were timber and closely built. Those stores destroyed were: S Oakley, bootmaker; FD Cooper, commission agent; R Graham, fruiterer; ME Gosley, tailor; Foley, hairdresser; M Redmond, Palace Hotel; WB Jones, auctioneer; W Couzens, fruiterer; H Newman, general storekeeper; WJ Overell and Son, general merchants; P Christensen, cabinet maker; W Hood, stationer; T Gaydon, chemist; W Lloyd, hairdresser; Mrs Dunne, fruiterer; Federal Jewellery Company; Dunn Bros, saddlers; H Wegner, bootmaker. The Bundaberg architect F H Faircloth was engaged to redesign most of the replacement buildings and called the first tenders in June 1902. Frederic Herbert (Herb) Faircloth was born in Maryborough in 1870 and was a pupil of German-trained Bundaberg architect Anton Hettrich. Faircloth set up his own practice in Bundaberg in 1893 and was very successful, eventually being responsible for the design of almost every important building in Bundaberg. He was also to have a major effect on the appearance and character of Childers. Photographs taken before the fire show shops of single skin timber construction on this site and this is probably the location of Oakley the bootmaker's premises as his wife, Emma owned the land from 1896. Like the other shops rebuilt after the 1902 fire, the new building was a single storey masonry building with a classically detailed pediment, generous glass window fronts, and decorative columns supporting the awning over the footpath. Unlike many others, it appears to have been designed as a single shop, one of the largest in the main street, rather than intended for a number of different tenancies as other newly built shops were. It is not known if this was the work of Faircloth, but it was at least influenced by his work on other shops. On completion the shop was leased to William Hood and Frederick William Ellwood as F Ellwood & Co, draper and outfitter. In 1922 it was leased to Herbert Stormonth, another draper. The shop seems to have been consistently used as a drapery and for clothing and in 1976 it was acquired by Boys Pty Ltd of Maryborough, a clothing store with branches in other towns. Boys extended their business into one shop of the group of three in the adjoining Jeffrey's Building. This is now a medical practice. A hairdressing salon now occupies a part of Ellwood's building as a separately owned shop, but the main occupancy is Dimmeys, a clothing store.  Description  The former Ellwood's Drapery is a single story masonry shop on the south side of Churchill Street, Childers main street. In common with other shops on this side of the street, it has a corrugated iron roof concealed by a classical revival parapet which is topped by a broken pediment flanked by a pair of urns. The awning across the footpath is now cantilevered and the building has modern shop fronts and a refitted interior. The section of the building occupied as a hairdresser has had the shop front reconstructed to resemble its original form.  Heritage listing  The former Ellwood & Co Drapery was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former drapery is important in demonstrating the evolution of Queensland's history representing evidence of the development of Childers in the early twentieth century, in particular, the rebuilding of the south side of the main street in the early 1900s following the 1902 fire. Together with much of the southern side of Childers main street it provides clear evidence of the impact of fire on Queensland towns where adequate water supply and fire services were lacking. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. It is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of early 1900s country town masonry commercial buildings, in particular the awnings, shop fronts, lanterns, and overall form. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. It contributes to the picturesque townscape of Churchill Street which is both remarkably architecturally coherent and intact The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. It has a special association with the life and work of Bundaberg architect FH Faircloth who was responsible for much of the appearance of the town of Childers in the twentieth century.

The fountains of Barcelona, in Spain, are a group of various jets of water that are utilized for the public benefit, or as ornamental elements to preexisting fountains, lakes, rivers, waterfalls, or diverse architectural installation. They can vary from the simplest pipe of water or the traditional symmetrical fountain, to complex arrays of founts decorated with sculptures or other ornamental elements. These fountains, as well as the various sculptures across the city, constitute an excellent example of the public art of Barcelona, which has so defined the City Condal. Many of the city's fountains add to its functional character an ornamental facet that, like the rest of its municipal art, has varied over time according to the artistic tendencies of the times, and has left the Catalan capital a collection of works admired greatly both by the citizens and by visitors. In Barcelona there are some 1,800 public fountains, among which there are some 600 that produce drinkable water, and some 200 that are chiefly considered ornamental. In the past, the fountains were installed in squares or central places in the villages chiefly to furnish a supply of water for the population.

His most notable work was Airedale in Ancient Times. He died trying to cross the swollen River Aire near to Dixon's mill in Saltaire.  Early life  Nicholson was born in Harewood, Leeds and was moved with the rest of the family to Eldwick, near Bingley, West Riding of Yorkshire in his infancy. He was educated on the moorland above Baildon and he was employed to pick heather whilst he repeated the lessons laid down to him by the schoolmaster, Briggs. The heather was used to make besoms, as the master did not have enough scholars to pay his way. By the age of eight, he began to show a predilection for poetry when he wrote on his maternal grandfather's barn door; 'Good god of truth, take Mat and Ruth, unto the heavenly throne, then good old Frank, may live in crank, and be disturb'd by none.' These lines were written in response to two people who were haranguing his grandfather. His education at twelve years old consisted of a final year at Bingley Grammar School tutored by Dr Hartley. Under Dr Hartley he flourished and with 'attention and good studies' he progressed well. He became good friends with Dr Hartley after his schooling, even so much so that Dr Hartley edited Airedale in Ancient Times for him. At the age of thirteen, he was put to work in his father's mill as a woolsorter. His parents had high ambitions for him, but in spite of this, he remained a woolsorter (or woolcomber) for the rest of his life alongside writing poetry. At night he would devour the works of John Milton, Shakespeare and Alexander Pope by candlelight and when his mother confiscated his candles, he made his own from a mustard pot, a cotton cord for a wick and olive oil to burn. Literary appreciation was his only shared ideal with his father, Thomas Nicholson, who on wild winter nights, would read the collected works to his family beside the fireplace.  Adulthood and marriages  John Nicholson did not prosper as a woolsorter and when his father was away from their home, he would take himself off across the moors or into the dells around Eldwick and read or play his Hautboy. He was quite accomplished on the Hautboy and his skill at this would introduce him to his first wife, Mary Driver, whom he met whilst playing at a wedding they both attended. They married when he was 19 and she 18. In 1810, not too long after the marriage, whilst delivering twins, Mary died in childbirth. Though one of the twins survived, Nicholson was disconsolate and pledged himself to the Wesleyan community. His father, mother and grandfather were all Wesleyan activists and driven by their fervour for Methodism, he willingly abandoned his previous activities and 'Took The Pledge' with the Temperance Society. He even buried his Hautboy on the moor as a token to his new found religious direction, though he did carve his name into a rock in Eldwick. This rock is still, to this day, known as 'Nicholson's Rock.' He became a preacher in the Bingley area and was well known for his original and zealous sermons which were peppered with quotes from Robert Blair and Edward Young. In 1813, after a probation of 18 months, he married again. His second wife was Martha Wild of Bingley. The marriage and the lack of probation time as a preacher (four years was required) prevented him from becoming a full- time minister and he left the Wesleyans in 1815. He was well known for his compassion and understanding. As part of the West Riding Militia during the Napoleonic fighting in the Iberian Peninsula, he was billeted at Pontefract. Whilst on drill, a boy hurt his head when knocked to the ground and when drill was over, Nicholson sought out the boy's family, made reparations and accosted his Colonel for knocking the boy over in the first place. Later, in Bradford, he paid for a destitute sailor to have bed and board after discovering he was a veteran of Trafalgar.  Publishing  In 1818, he moved his family to Red Beck and worked in Shipley Fields Mill. These were his happiest days, when he could write and work and the family was not too big (he eventually had nine sons and daughters, eight with Martha and one surviving twin from his marriage to Mary). He was said to be knowledgeable and was well liked within the area. This led to him being commissioned to write a play, The Robber of the Alps, which was swiftly followed by another play, The Siege of Bradford, based upon events from the civil war. In 1822 he moved to Harden Beck and wrote beside the river and rose in the early morning to sit by rocks overlooking the valley and write his poetry. It was here that Airedale in Ancient Times was finished and it had its first print run in April 1825. Such was his fame in the area, that the first print run sold out very quickly and the second edition was printed in November of the same year. After the success of Airedale in Ancient Times, he embarked upon selling his books across the north of England and abandoned his former job as a woolcomber. Despite some reports that he spent all the money he earned on drink, his sons attested that he always came home with pockets full. In 1827 he undertook his first trip to London to try and sell his poetry there too. Whilst out with friends in Drury Lane, Nicholson was left to his own devices and was quite drunk. He argued with a statue of Shakespeare and caused such a racket that he was imprisoned overnight and tried before a judge next morning. By all accounts, the trial was a humorous affair and the judge released him without charge, but not before Nicholson dragged the officer who arrested him around the court in retaliation for how he had been treated the night before. Nicholson left London soon after in case his wife heard of his antics through the papers and came to collect him. Despite the early trip to London going wrong, he visited London once more, though this time Martha accompanied him to ensure he remained out of trouble. Whilst there, they buried one of their children who had died in infancy. On his return to Yorkshire, the family moved to Saltaire and Nicholson took to work for Sir Titus Salt, whom he viewed as a kind benefactor. In spite of Sir Salt's avowed distaste for alcohol, he overlooked the fact that Nicholson was drinking more and more, year on year.  Death  Nicholson liked to go out onto the moors and breathe in the air to get away from the smoke of Bradford. Every holiday he would spend on the moors and on Good Friday 1843 (April 13) he set out to visit his aunt. On the way he visited several 'places' and by the time he came to the stepping stones (known locally as the Hippings) across the River Aire at Saltaire, he was quite drunk. He slipped and fell into the water and was carried down the river for a short distance. He managed to haul himself out of the river, but he died on the riverbank. His body was taken to the Bay Horse Inn at Baildon and he was buried in Bingley All Saints Graveyard on the 18 April 1843. His funeral was attended by a thousand mourners and a friendly benefactor paid for the gravestone. He left behind his second wife, Martha and eight children. By 1858, the stepping stones in the River Aire had been removed and a campaign was underway to raise money for the family Nicholson left behind. Queen Victoria personally sent ¬£5 to the family.

Beyond the trees is the road, the building of which necessitated the removal of many graves, John Nicholson's being among them Some of Nicholson's original manuscripts can be found in Saltaire and Keighley libraries. These manuscripts belonged to members of Nicholson's family and were donated in the late 19th century. In 1904, the graveyard surrounding Bingley All Saints Parish Church was bisected by the building of a new road. During this construction many graves were moved and the gravestones were used as flags to line the pathways around the church. It was during this period of reconstruction that John Nicholson's gravestone was destroyed. His first wife's gravestone is located in the western part of the churchyard just south west of the main entrance into the church. A play was written about the poet and first performed in 1993 in Salts Mill just metres from where the poet died. Poetry or Bust written by Tony Harrison is a tragi-comic tale that relates the life and sad death of the Airedale Poet. Tony Harrison has a bust of John Nicholson in his house. The Saltaire Sentinel runs a poetry competition each year entitled 'The John Nicholson Poetry Prize.' In 2011 the John Nicholson Prize was won by the Derbyshire Poet Martin Ward with the poem 'Saltaire at 13 O'clock. Martin Ward is sometimes known as 'The Runner Poet', and his published works include 'The Beresford Monuments' and 'Seven Women Dancing' from the anthology 'A Place of Wonder' published by Templar Poetry. A plinth commemorating the poet was installed at the Prince of Wales Park, Bingley, in 1870. The plinth was funded by public donation.

This gene encodes a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of oxaloacetate (OAA) to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) in the presence of guanosine triphosphate (GTP). A cytosolic form of this protein is encoded by a different gene and is the key enzyme of gluconeogenesis in the liver. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described.[provided by RefSeq, Apr 2014] Structure The PCK2 gene encodes the mitochondrial form of PCK and shares a 68% homology in DNA sequence with PCK1 and 70% homology in amino acid sequence with its encoded cytosolic form, PCK1. Moreover, PCK2 shares structural homology with PCK1, indicating that the genes originated from a common ancestor gene. Nonetheless, though both genes possess ten exons and nine introns, the sizes of their introns may differ by ~2 kb, with the largest intron in PCK2 spanning 2.5 kb. Altogether, the total length of the PCK2 gene spans ~10 kb. Another difference is the presence of Alu sequences in its introns that are absent in PCK1. PCK2 also contains an 18-residue mitochondrial targeting sequence at its N-terminal. Potential regulatory elements, including five GC boxes and three CCAAT boxes, lie 1819 bp upstream of the transcription start site. In addition, the proximal promoter region of PCK2 contains two putative ATF/CRE sequences which bind ATF4.  Function  As a PCK, PCK2 catalyzes the GTP- driven conversion of OAA to PEP as a rate-limiting step in gluconeogenesis. This conversion step serves as a bridge between glycolytic and TCA cycle intermediates in the mitochondria. In pancreatic Œ≤-cells, PCK2 regulates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by recycling GTP generated from the succinyl-CoA synthase reaction. This drives the TCA cycle, converting PEP to pyruvate to acetyl-CoA for the citrate synthase reaction. Since nearly all of the glycolytic reactions upstream of PEP and downstream of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) are reversible, PCK2-mediated synthesis of PEP could fuel multiple biosynthetic processes, such as serine synthesis, glycerol synthesis, and nucleotide synthesis. Notably, PCK2 preferentially converts OAA derived from lactate and, thus, can promote biosynthesis even under low-glucose conditions. As a result, PCK2 activity contributes to cell growth and survival during stress. While PCK1 is mainly expressed in the liver and kidney, PCK2 is ubiquitously expressed in various cell types, including leukocytes and neurons, as well as in non-gluconeogenic tissues, including pancreas, brain, heart. Moreover, while PCK1 expression is regulated by hormones or nutrients involved in gluconeogenesis, PCK2 is constitutively expressed. These differences indicate that PCK2 may also perform non-gluconeogenic functions. Clinical Significance PCK2 is associated with several cancers, including lung cancer, and promotes tumorigenesis through its gluconeogenic function. In low-glucose settings, stress to the endoplasmic reticulum upregulates ATF4, which then upregulates PCK2. As PCK2 allows cells to utilize alternative cataplerotic pathways to convert TCA cycle intermediates to glycolytic intermediates, PCK2 activity can enhance the survival tumor cells facing reduced glucose levels. Due to the gluconeogenic function of PCK2, PCK2 deficiency is expected to disrupt glucose homeostasis and result in hypoglycemia. However, though two cases have been documented, a subsequent study suggested that PCK2 deficiency may not have been the primary cause.

It belongs to the Church of Sweden. History and architecture The oldest part of the church is the sacristy, located to the north of the nave. The sacristy dates from the late 13th or early 14th century and was probably originally attached to a wooden church. The main part of the single-nave church that can be seen today was probably built around 1430-1460. The church porch, although slightly later than the rest of the church, was most probably part of the original design. It still contains the door of the earlier, wooden church. The door dates from the late 13th century. Inside, the vaulting of the church is decorated with fresco. These date from circa 1515-1525 but were plastered over during the 18th century. They were uncovered during a renovation in 1927. The baptismal font dates from the late 13th century, while most of the rest of the church fittings are from the post- Reformation time.

A former textbook writer, Sheinkin began writing full-time nonfiction books for young readers in 2008. His work has been widely acclaimed for its ability to transform historical information into thrilling, accessible accounts. Rabbi Harvey Sheinkin has written and illustrated three fictional graphic novels about Rabbi Harvey, a fictional Jewish rabbi who also functions as an Old West sheriff, using Jewish rabbinical wisdom to solve problems usually solved with firearms in the high in the fictional Rocky Mountain town of Elk Spring, Colorado. The books, which were published through Jewish Lights Publishing, consist of The Adventures of Rabbi Harvey, Rabbi Harvey Rides Again, and Rabbi Harvey vs. the Wisdom Kid. The eclectic stories, which combine Jewish legends and frontier legends, sprung from Sheinkin's own eclectic childhood as a Jewish-American boy raised on both Jewish folktales and American Westerns. The character of Rabbi Harvey also contains elements of the author's own father, David Sheinkin. Awards & honors Sheinkin's nonfiction books, Bomb: The Race to Build‚Äîand Steal‚Äîthe World's Most Dangerous Weapon and The Port Chicago 50: Disaster, Mutiny, and the Fight for Civil Rights, were both National Book Award finalists.

The group claims ideological continuity with the original Black Panther Party for Self-Defense and, according to its official website, organizes gang members to \\"stop genocide against each other and to stand up against white supremacy and capitalist oppression.\\" History=Establishment The Black Riders Liberation Party traces its origins back to a class conducted at the Youth Training School in Chino, California,Malaika Kambon, \\"To Serve the People: Black Riders Liberation Party, New Generation Black Panther Party for Self- Defense,\\" San Francisco Bay View, Sept. 20, 2013. conducted by the California Youth Authority for prisoners in the California state penal system.Comrade Aryana, \\"Black Riders Show Resistance is Possible,\\" Workers World, [Nov. 25, 1999]. Among these was Mischa Culton, an individual also using the noms de guerre \\"General T.A.C.O.,\\" an acronym for Taking All Capitalists Out,Bethania Palma Markus, \\"Black Riders Liberation Party Says Authorities Targeted Its Headquarters After May Day Protests,\\" LAist, May 4, 2012 and \\"Wolverine Shakur.\\"Bill Kilby, \\"A New Generation Black Panther Talks About Baltimore and Black America,\\" Vice, May 10, 2015. Inspired by the historic example of the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, upon his release from prison in 1996 Culton sought to build a new political organization by gathering others from the predominately African-American ghettos of South Central Los Angeles and Watts. The fledgling organization started by Culton was energized by a November 17, 1997 police shooting of a mentally troubled black man in the Jordan Downs housing complex in Watts, a suicidal individual who had lunged at officers with a butter knife. The result was a vigilance program given the provocative moniker \\"Watch a Pig,\\" which encouraged citizens \\"standing a legal distance from the pigs and making sure they don't brutalize the people,\\" in the words of the group's \\"Minister of Public Relations.\\" Development Originally limited to Southern California, in 2010 a section of the organization based in Oakland, California was initiated. In November 2012 the BRLP launched a mass organization called the Inter-Communal Solidarity Committee in Los Angeles, attempting to build broader support for a common program. The new front group was inspired by the National Committee to Combat Fascism (NCCF) of the Black Panther Party, according to a representative of the organization. In March 2015 the BRLP decided to take advantage of the open gun carrying law in Texas, traveling to Austin to conduct an armed march to the Texas state capitol together with the Huey P. Newton Gun Club. Held in conjunction with the heavily attended South by Southwest conference, the joint march was conducted in an effort to \\"raise the cry for armed self-defense\\" by the black community, according to the marchers. Ideology The group styles itself as an organization of \\"black revolutionaries\\" engaged in a \\"people's war\\" against a white-dominated \\"oppressive capitalistic system.\\" The group advocates on behalf of civil rights and social justice and actively seeks to end gang violence so as to \\"change gang mentality into revolutionary mentality.\\" The BRLP professes a belief in the ideas of revolutionary socialism, and on May Day 2012 were part of a small and ineffectual \\"General Strike\\" effort in Los Angeles. The group claimed that their May 1 participation was met with retaliation by government authorities, who are said to have burst into the home of party leader Mischa Culton two days later with automatic rifles during what was later explained as a routine \\"compliance check\\" by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. The Black Riders have adopted a party manifesto known as the Black Commune program which put forward many of the demands of the original 1966 Ten-Point Program, with the addition of new demands (for the proper medical care of AIDS sufferers and an end to the trade in crack cocaine in the black community). The group's founder and chief theoretician, Mischa Culton, has called Barack Obama, the first African-American President of the United States, the \\"ultimate neocolonial puppet\\" and \\"the grand House Negro\\" and declared that the American government and political system was \\"designed to enslave, massacre, and genocide our people out of this country.\\" Culton advocates for an autonomous, black-directed movement, encouraging sympathetic whites to fight against police abuse and the ideology of white supremacy. In a 2015 interview with Vice magazine, he declared: > \\"It's important that black people are allowed to define themselves and their > struggle, for outsiders not to come in and co-opt or water down our > righteous revolutionary rage. The main way is to ride on the pigs, to go > against the pigs. You've gotta study the history of John Brown, 'cause if > you're not John Brown, you might as well get out of town.\\" Programs and publications In addition to its \\"Watch a Pig\\" police monitoring campaign, the BRLP conducts ideological training under the slogan \\"Educate 2 Liberate\\" and maintains what it calls the \\"Break the Lock Prisoner Support\\" program. The BRLP launched its own newspaper in 2012, the eponymous Black Riders Liberation Party. In popular culture The group was the subject of a 2013 documentary film, Let Um Hear Ya Coming. Criticism The Southern Poverty Law Center classifies the Black Riders as a black separatist hate group.

At approximately 5:30 p.m. CET a timed bomb exploded in a trash can in front of a McDonald's restaurant on Protifa≈°istick√Ωch bojovn√≠kov 6, in Ko≈°ice. As there was no one around at the time of the attack, it did not cause any casualties or injuries. Furthermore, it only exploded partially, which did not project nails attached to the explosive. The perpetrator, Ladislav Kuc, was convicted on 8 counts of terrorism, 1 count of attempted terrorism and 1 count of unlawful possession of weapons. He was sentenced to 25 years in a maximum- security prison. It was the first time that anyone had been convicted on terrorism charges in Slovakia.  Trial  The Ko≈°ice I County Court sentenced Kuc to 25 years for various offenses connected to the attack, as well as to his planned attacks. Throughout the proceedings, Kuc demanded the death penalty (which is banned in Slovakia) and a martyr's death, which his attorney interpreted as signs of mental illness. After filing an appeal at the Ko≈°ice Regional Court (second-instance court in criminal proceedings), the court initially canceled the lower court's ruling, but after the County Court reviewed new psychological assessment submitted by Kuc's attorney, he was again convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison. This time the appeal failed and the Regional Court upheld the ruling. Kuc filed an appeal at the Constitutional Court of Slovakia but the court did not challenge the ruling. Having exhausted judicial options in Slovakia, Kuc submitted a petition to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. The ECHR ruled in 2017 that Slovakia had violated Kuc's human rights by unreasonable and unfounded pre- trial detention. Kuc was awarded EUR17,500 in both damages(EUR6,500) and cost of proceedings(EUR9,000).

Born in Ireland to a Jewish family, Green moved to Dunfermline at a young age and studied to become a dentist in Edinburgh. He moved to Glasgow following his graduation to work as a dentist, before joining the Territorial Army upon the start of the Second World War. Green's brigade was captured in June 1940 at St. Val√©ry-en- Caux, and he spent months travelling between Prisoner-of-war camps providing dental work for fellow prisoners-of-war as well as German troops. Eventually, British intelligence agency MI9 recruited him as a spy to relay information from these camps to assist in rescue efforts and strategic operations. He would write coded letters to his family and friends in Scotland, which would then be analysed by MI9 for secret messages informing them of goings-on within the camps. After the war, Green married and moved back to Glasgow and worked as a businessman then, later, as a dentist. He wrote a best-selling book about his experiences titled From Colditz With Code. Green's letters were auctioned as part of a mixed lot in June 2015, along with photographs from his camp, and sold for ¬£6,500. Green died in September 1990 at the age of 77.  Life  Green was born to a Jewish family in Killarney, a town in County Kerry in Ireland, though some sources say he was born in Carlisle. He eventually moved to Dunfermline in Scotland, and studied dentistry at the Dental School of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. Upon his graduation he moved to Glasgow to work in dentistry. Upon the onset of the Second World War in 1939, Green joined the Medical Unit of the Edinburgh University Officer Training Corps, part of the Territorial Army (now known as the Army Reserve). He joined the medical unit of the Glaswegian 51st (Highland) Division where he served in the 152 (Highland) Field Ambulance.  Capture and spy work  On 12 June 1940, Green and his brigade were captured at St. Val√©ry-en-Caux, after Major General Victor Fortune and French troops surrendered to Erwin Rommel. He travelled from camp to camp‚Äîstaying at Blechhammer, Lamsdorf, Sandbostel, Westertimke, and Heyderbreck‚Äîproviding dental work for both German troops and fellow prisoners of war, and eventually ended up at Colditz Castle. He had to hide his Judaism from troops there, disposing of his identity tags and claiming to be Presbyterian; at one stage, he narrowly escaped punishment for this deception through an assertion from Captain Hugh Dickie, a Medical Officer, that he had been circumcised for medical reasons. Shortly after his capture, MI9, a department of the War Office which routinely communicated with PoWs, recruited Green as a spy. His role was to communicate between Colditz and London through coded letters. Letters he sent to his family in Dunfermline between 1941 and 1944 would contain lines that were, to native speakers, effectively nonsense; however, these were coded messages to be decrypted by Intelligence staff in London. MI9 provided his family draft letters to send back to the camp, as well as some from fictional correspondents invented by the War Office. German soldiers staffing the PoW camps only possessed a limited knowledge of English, so the code remained undetected. He provided information on Germany troop movements and railways lines, what troops should bring with them should they too be captured, as well as which materials should be sent to Colditz to help PoWs escape. He also exposed an English Nazi informer through his work, who after the war was prosecuted for treason. MI9 explained the system to his family in Dunfermline in one letter: They wrote again in 1944 to assure them Green was \\"a young man of great resource\\" and urging them to \\"try not to worry\\".  Post-war life  After his release, Green moved back to Scotland, and was engaged to Anne Miller of Glasgow in 1945. Some of his letters were eventually donated to the Imperial War Museum in London. He worked as a businessman before returning to dentistry, and in 1971, wrote a best-selling book about his experiences as a spy, From Colditz With Code. A 1989 edition of the book was dedicated to his son, Alan. He died in September 1990, aged 77. A collection of forty letters sent to and from Colditz, as well as photographs and imagery of Green and other PoWs, were auctioned by Bonhams in Knightsbridge, London, on 18 June 2014, with an estimated sale price of between ¬£4,000 and ¬£6,000. Spokesperson Julien Roup said that \\"the risks he was running, as a Jewish prisoner-of-war in Nazi hands, hardly bear thinking about. Under the surreal humour of his letters lies horror and quite extraordinary bravery.\\" The lot was ultimately sold for ¬£6,500.

Three named tributaries enter Smith River, all from the right. From source to mouth, they are Gate, Browder, and Bunchgrass creeks. Lakes End campground About halfway through its course, Smith River enters Smith Reservoir, which covers when filled to capacity. A United States Forest Service campground near the head of the lake is accessible only by boat from a launch at the south end of the reservoir, away. The primitive campground, Lakes End, has 17 sites for tents. Amenities include toilets and picnic tables but no drinking water. The campground is generally open from May through September. Power plants Smith Reservoir functions as a holding tank for water used to generate electricity at two power plants along the McKenzie River. The Carmen‚ÄìSmith Hydroelectric Project, owned by the Eugene Water and Electric Board, shunts water through a tunnel from the Carmen Diversion Reservoir on the upper McKenzie to Smith Reservoir, which has a bigger holding capacity. From there, water is piped from Smith Reservoir to the Carmen Power Plant. Water from the plant discharges into the Trail Bridge Reservoir then generates more electricity at the Trail Bridge Power Plant before returning to the McKenzie below Trail Bridge Dam.

Both did not swear loyalty to Alfonso XII and have not participated in Senate works Though the Catalan Carlist leader was Luis de Llauder y Dalmases, Solferino was gradually emerging as one of key regional jefes,the process was not painless, as there were Carlist provincial leaders, like Salvador Soliva, who in 1896-8 opposed Solferino; they grumbled at the well-off dominating in the Barcelona party structures, inactivity and jefes having been appointed rather than elected, Canal 1998, pp. 109-110 presiding over some party meetings as early as in 1896.La Epoca 20.01.96, available here, for 1897 see El D√≠a 08.11.97, available here He remained involved in pilgrimage activities.like the 1894 workers' pilgrimage to Rome, La Uni√≥n Cat√≥lica 22.02.94, available here A close collaborator of Llauder, both worked together developing regional Traditionalist media, especially a daily Correo Catalan and a weekly La Hormiga de Oro.

It is not clear what the objectives of the claimant were, which major politicians were involved, how the conspiracy developed, who were its leaders, what plan (if any) they had and so on. There were most extravagant theories circulating, e.g. that disturbances were provoked to cause Madrid stock exchange perturbations, see Fern√°ndez Escudero 2012, pp. 391-6 Though scholars do not list him among those involvedlike Tamarit, Fern√°ndez Escudero 2012, pp. 383-4.

Not a rally-type public speaker,he was seldom reported by the press as speaking at public gatherings, though at times he did appear, see La Epoca 23.04.03, available here he excelled rather in behind-the-stage dealings. In mid-1900s together with his proteg√© Junyent he emerged as advocate of a broad Catalanist coalition, forged by opposition to the 1906 Ley de Jurisdicciones.Molas 2009, p. 5 Though alliance with different breeds of Republicanism raised many eyebrows and public embrace between Solferino - representative of \\"blood-thirsty clericalism\\"El Pais 21.01.07, available here  and vehemently anti-clerical Salmer√≥n sent shocking waves across Catalonia,compare El D√≠a 22.05.06, available here; the alliance became even a point of reference even in various jokes, see Madrid Cientifico 525 (1906), available here Llanza enjoyed full support of the claimant,Fern√°ndez Escudero 2012, p. 418 also when joining executive junta of Solidaritat Catalana.the junta was formed by Miquel Junyent, Solferino, Francesc Camb√≥, Pere Rahola, J.

However, the others ridiculed him as typical example of political corruption, Xavier Tomafoch, Pol√≠tica, eleccions i caciquisme a Vic [PhD thesis Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona], Barcelona 2003, p. 314 Though he was further amicably disposed towards La Lliga, Solferino's tenure is rather marked by his efforts to cope with another new phenomenon. At that time Catalunya muntanyenca, traditional inner-Catalonia of rural hills and valleys, was getting dominated by the maritime belt, the urban area and its newly emergent social strata. One of its features was proletarian radicalism of different political signs, including Carlism. Around the turn of the decades the center of gravity of Catalan Carlism moved from countryside to Barcelona; between 1907 and 1913 the number of circulos in the city grew from 3 to 11,since the early 1890 Solferino was actively supporting Carlist structural buildup, working that \\"there is no village in Spain without a Carlist junta or circulo\\", quoted after Canal 1998, p. 94 most of the new ones in peripheral workers districts.Winston 2014, p. 71 Since the 1906 rout of Traditionalist youth at the Arenas bullring, suffered at hands of the Lerrouxist hit-squad,Winston 2014, p. 70 new Carlist proletarian groupingslike \\"Ateneo Obrero Legitimista\\", \\"El Porvenir\\" and \\"Crit de Patria\\" Carlist worker clubs, Winston 2014, pp. 69-70, 75-6 were getting increasingly radical. Though the movement has always been known for its belligerent spirit if not sheer brutality, specifics of the newly emergent Barcelona Requet√© organization was its penchant for a new type of urban violence, known as pistolerismo.the young Carlist breed of militants \\"crossed the line between accepting violence as a necessary tool and exulting in its positive and regenerative qualities\\", Winston 2014, p. 84 Already in 1908 Solferino was interrogated by the police in relation to an obscure and unexplained episode known as \\"caso Rull\\".a certain Rull was a police undercover operative penetrating the Barcelona proletarian conspiracy world; he was suspected of having been a double-agent. However, explosives he was associated with were planted in obscure and unfrequented passages apparently with little harm intended, which led some to suspect he was on service of an unidentified extreme party aiming at bringing police forces into disrepute, compare El Pais 09.04.08, available here, Eduardo Gonz√°lez Calleja, La raz√≥n de la fuerza: orden p√∫blico, subversi√≥n y violencia pol√≠tica en la Espa√±a de la Restauraci√≥n (1875‚Äì1917), Madrid 1998, , p. 401 After taking office he declared war on youth party radicalism, advocated by the likes of Dalmacio Iglesias,Calleja 1998, p. 494, Jordi Canal, El carlismo, Madrid 2000, , p. 269, Eduardo Gonz√°lez Calleja, Paramilitaritzaci√≥ i violencia politica a l'Espanya del primer terc de segle: el requet√© tradicionalista (1900-1936), [in:] Revista de Girona 37 (1991), p. 70 claiming that it compromised Carlist reputation of \\"the party of order\\".Winston 2014, p. 85, Winston 2001, p. 90. In 1911 Solferino himself faced legal action for an article he published in El Correo Catalan, allegedly assaulting a civil governor , Heraldo Militar 12.09.11, available here; the case was eventually dropped, see La Epoca 03.03.12, available here Following the 1912 Granollers incident, when Requet√©s fired at Republican crowd resulting in one fatal casualty and many people wounded,Winston 2014, p. 84 Solferino dissolved the nucleus of radicalism, Ateneo Tradicionalista,La Epoca 12.04.12, available here though the conflict with its activists like Vives Suria continued also later on.El Pais 08.06.13, available here with de Cerralbo and the Carlist party executive, 1913 In terms of political vision Solferino pursued a rather flexible strategy, tending to support various Right-wing coalitions where possible. Always rather conciliatory towards the Integrists,e.g. apperaing jointly with the Integrists on gatherings against secular schools, La Epoca 20.03.10, available here in 1910 he endorsed \\"coalici√≥n de elementos de orden\\"La Correspondencia de Espa√±a 02.05.10, available here later aiming for alliances with Integros, La Lliga, Conservatives and Comit√© de Defensa Social.La Correspondencia de Espa√±a 10.11.13, available here, Molas 2009, p. 9 At that time he was already a follower of V√°zquez de Mella, most dynamic Carlist politician increasingly at odds with the claimant.already in 1907 the two were reported as friends, with Solferino driving de Mella across Barcelona in his car, El Pais 21.01.07, available here When a pro-Mellist de Cerralbo was reinstated as national jefe, in 1912 Solferino was appointed to the newly created national executive, Junta Central Superior,Fern√°ndez Escudero 2012, p. 443 and entered two of its specialized committees.namely the electoral and organization ones, Fern√°ndez Escudero 2012, p. 459 Though don Jaime was increasingly upset with Solferino and his rule in Catalonia,in 1912 he noted that \\"muy mal van con Solferino en Catalu√±a\\", Juan Ram√≥n de Andr√©s Mart√≠n, El caso Feli√∫ y el dominio de Mella en el partido carlista en el per√≠odo 1909‚Äì1912, [in:] Historia contempor√°nea 10 (1997), p. 104 officially he demonstrated accord.in April 1913, when in Lourdes on great propaganda meeting, Solferino was sitting right next to don Jaime, Fern√°ndez Escudero 2012, p. 465 It was rather Llanza who was getting tired of conflict, especially as Junta Provincial of Lleida refused to accept a Barcelona-appointed Carlist candidate to the Cortes and situation in the province became increasingly chaotic.Antoni de Nuix, head of Lleida's Carlism, was supported by the local Carlist daily El Correo de L√©rida and most of the junta, while local Juventud Jaimista and its periodical remained loyal to Solferino. Takeovers of both reviews followed with situation turning into total chaos, see Conxita Mir, Lleida (1890-1936): caciquisme pol√≠tic i lluita electoral, Barcelona 1985, , pp. 308-310 Solferino first tried to resign in 1913,La Correspondencia de Espa√±a 15.11.13, available here, Fern√°ndez Escudero 2012, p. 458 but it was not until May 1914 resignation of the entire Junta Regional that Junyent was appointed his successor.La Epoca 11.05.14, available here; Melgar advised that as \\"en Catalu√±a dentro el partido reinaba el desconcierto\\" the resignation be accepted by the claimant, Fern√°ndez Escudero 2012, p. 455 Last years Juan Vazquez de Mella Decomposition and chaos in Catalan Carlism continued; unable to cope and re-introduce discipline, Junyent and the new Junta Regional resigned and were indeed dismissed in 1916.Fern√°ndez Escudero 2012, p. 456 Solferino was reinstated as regional leader in February 1917,with Miquel Salellas Ferrer as deputy, Molas 2009, p. 9 but the crisis kept unfolding. Provincial issues aside, its dominating thread became the conflict between supporters of don Jaime and those siding with Vazquez de Mella. As in 1918 the claimant was released from his home arrest in Austria, early next year he arrived in Paris and issued two manifestos, lambasting those disloyal and announcing forthcoming personal changes. Solferino initially adopted what seemed like a wait-and-see policy, mid-February 1919 issuing a circular which urged order and discipline.El Sol 19.02.19, available here However, next month he addressed the new national leader, Pascual Com√≠n, with a resignation note.La Correspondencia de Espa√±a 12.03.19, available here, also Heraldo de Madrid 12.03.19, available here Political path of Solferino after 1919 is not entirely clear. Competent scholars claim that he left mainstream Carlism and joined the Mellistas, at that time attempting to institutionalize their group as a separate party.Fern√°ndez Escudero 2012, p. 514, Jos√© Luis Orella Mart√≠nez, El origen del primer catolicismo social espa√±ol, [PhD thesis] Madrid 2012, p. 182 However, despite his prestigious title and high position within Traditionalist structures, the most detailed study on the Mellist breakup does not list him at all.Juan Ram√≥n de Andr√©s Mart√≠n, El cisma mellista.

His academic field is contemporary political history, especially recent Thai history from 1930. He is a critic of Thailand's monarchy and its l√®se majest√© law. He has lived in self-imposed exile in France since the 2014 Thai coup d'√©tat, following violent attacks and l√®se majest√© charges.  Background  Somsak Jeamteerasakul was born on 22 June 1958. He graduated from secondary school at Suankularb Wittayalai School and Thammasat University. Somsak has been interested in politics since he was a student representative during his secondary education. He was a student leader and present at the campus during the 6 October 1976 Thammasat University massacre. He was arrested and later spent two years in jail. Somsak Jeamteerasakul earned a PhD degree from Monash University in Australia. His doctoral thesis The communist movement in Thailand was published in 1991. During the 1990s and early-2000s Somsak wrote extensively and critically about the role of the monarchy. He has been openly critical of both Rama VII and Rama IX both of whom Somsak perceives as having obstructed the development of democracy in Thailand. Royalist groups have accused him of trying to \\"overthrow the monarchy\\". Somsak has denied the accusation in a press statement in which he explicitly states, \\"Each and every one of my public statement and written work is premised on the assumption of the continuation of the monarchy.\\" Research and political activism Somsak's research deals primarily with recent Thai history and its interpretation, especially regarding the role of the Thai monarchy in politics since the Siamese revolution of 1932, the death of King Ananda Mahidol, and the events of 14 October 1973 and 6 October 1976. Considered one of the experts in the subject of the Thai monarchy, Somsak often presents viewpoints contrary to the mainstream understanding prevalent in Thai society, including frequent criticism of the monarchy and calls for its reform. Academically, Somsak is known for having an independent, outspoken style, including harsh criticisms that have led to conflict with other progressive scholars such as Charnvit Kasetsiri, Nidhi Eoseewong, Thongchai Winichakul, and Giles Ji Ungpakorn. Similarly, although Somsak has strong sympathies towards the Red Shirt movement, he is not affiliated with the associated Pheu Thai Party or the governments of Thaksin Shinawatra and Yingluck Shinawatra, and has directly criticized Thaksin and Pheu Thai.  Criticism of monarchy  In 2010 Somsak Jeamteerasakul posted eight proposals to change Thailand's monarchy. One of the suggestions called for removing an article from Thailand's constitution that speaks of the king as \\"enthroned in a position of revered worship\\". Another proposal calls for abolishing \\"one-sided public relations and educational activities related to the monarchy.\\" Somsak advocates the abolition of Privy Council of Thailand and abolition of Crown Property Bureau, which has been estimated to hold US$37 billion or more in assets and according to Thai law can be spent \\"at the king's pleasure\\". Somsak also advocates the abolition of article 112 of Thailand's criminal code, the l√®se-majest√© law, which he described as: \\"against the principles of democracy and even against common sense. \\"You cannot regard the monarchy as always right all the time.\\" Somsak's eight-point proposal to reform Thailand's monarchy: # Repeal Section 8 of the Constitution, [which says the King shall be enthroned in a position of revered worship and shall not be violated and no person shall expose the King to any sort of accusation or action.] # Repeal Section 112 of the Criminal Code # Abolish the Privy Council # Repeal the 1948 Crown Assets Management Act # Ban all one-sided public relations and education about the monarchy # Revoke the royal prerogative in expressing political opinions # Revoke the royal prerogative in all royal projects # Ban all donations for use at the royal discretion On 28 July 2019, the birthday of King Vajiralongkorn, Somsak reiterated his call for reform of the monarchy. Somsak Jeamteerasakul has been critical of King Bhumibol Adulyadej for his role in Thammasat University massacre. Somsak argues Bhumibol's involvement in drumming up anti- communist hysteria and his support of far-right royalist paramilitaries makes him partly responsible of the brutal beatings, rape, and murder of the students on the day of the massacre.  L√®se Majest√© complaints  In May 2011, the Royal Thai Army filed a l√®se majest√© complaint against Somsak Jeamteerasakul due to an open letter he had written and published on the internet in response to a Princess Chulabhorn TV interview. In the open letter, Somsak criticized the princess for attending the funeral of a pro- monarchy demonstrator in 2008, but not mentioning in her interview the deaths of anti-government protesters in the 2010 Thai military crackdown. Somsak denied the l√®se majest√© charges and argued that Section 112 of the Criminal Code, dealing with l√®se majest√©, only applies to the king, queen, heir- apparent, and regent. In 2014, the Thai military junta reportedly filed another l√®se majest√© complaint against Somsak. In response to the junta's l√®se majest√© accusations, Somsak wrote: \\"It is clear that I would never have the opportunity to be treated fairly in accordance with the laws. Therefore, I have the legitimate right to preserve my life, body, and liberty by refusing to allow the military junta, who committed the treasonous act of seizing power, to arrest and harm me under the excuse of lese majeste.\\" In February 2016, Royal Thai Police were reported to be investigating statements made by Somsak Jeamteerasakul in a 2013 TV interview as possible l√®se majest√© violations. In the interview Somsak expressed his opinion that the Thai royal family's influence and power exceeds that of a modern constitutional monarchy. Somsak's followers on social media have been summoned and questioned by the military junta. Thailand's Technology Crime Suppression Division has informed them that sharing or liking content from Somsak Jeamteerasakul may constitute a l√®se majest√© offence.  Post-2014 military coup  After the 2014 Thai coup d'√©tat and military junta's established National Council for Peace and Order, Somsak Jeamteerasakul was one of the first academics summoned to receive what the military called \\"attitude adjustment\\". After refusing to comply with the summons, the military junta issued an arrest warrant for Somsak and revoked his passport. During this period, Somsak went into hiding and later confirmed he hadn't lived in his house since a February 2014 gun attack. He reappeared on social media again in November 2014. He said to have changed his place of stay frequently during this period. It was later confirmed that Somsak had fled to France. Somsak explained his self-imposed exile by writing: \\"In the situation that individuals who severely violated the laws have installed themselves as rulers of the country by illegal means, and aimed to cause harm to my life, body, and liberty in such a direct manner, I regard it as the rights and duty of a bureaucrat, citizen, and member of the Thammasat community to disobey, oppose, and reject their effort to jail and harm me.\\" In July 2015 the Thai military junta made an extradition request for Somsak and other critics of the monarchy living in France. France granted Somsak and other l√®se majest√© suspects refugee status in 2015.  Status at Thammasat University  In February 2015, Somkit Lertpaithoon, the Rector of Thammasat University, signed an order to end the employment of Somsak Jeamteerasakul. Thammasat University lecturers publicly criticized the decision as unfair and politically motivated. Thammasat economist Associate Professor Pichit Likitkijsomboon said: \\"It‚Äôs apparent that university administrators are ready to use legal means to threaten those who have differing political opinions\\". ‚ÄúOne can look at it as an attempt to set an example for other [academics] who come out to make a [pro-democracy] move. It‚Äôs likely about his political stance,‚Äù Thammasat political scientist Pongkwan Sawasdipakdi said. The rector defended the decision as not politically motivated but because Somsak had failed to show up to work for 15 consecutive days. Somsak responded that he had attempted to seek for a sabbatical leave and then offered to resign his position but both of these requests were denied. University administrators stated that while they did receive Somsak's letter of resignation it should have been submitted 15 days prior to his departure under university's regulations. The administrative court ruled on July 2016 that the termination of Somsak from his position at the Thammasat University was illegal. The court commented in its decision that Somsak had \\"extraordinary reasons\\" that prevented him from resigning his position at the university. Termination from his university position would have meant a loss of pension and other benefits gained over a career of over 20 years.

Features of mobile procurement software include mobile purchase order creation, on-demand notifications, and real-time analytics. What makes mobile procurement successful is the ability to leverage software-side servers to move data along. The key benefit for organizations using mobile procurement systems is the ability to track business operations using any ordinary mobile device. Mobile procurement software is generally represented in the form of custom applications provided as an add-on feature of a larger enterprise resource planning software solution. As such, if the goal of a mobile procurement system should be to complement existing information systems, mobile procurement software should typically involve the needs of procurement professionals before implementation. Assuring that necessary features are prioritized over having many features is key to successful user adoption. It also simplifies order management processes by removing the confusion and disorder often seen with paper-based procurement. Mobile procurement provides a clearer view of the steps behind procurement and give companies the insight needed to consistently secure the best possible total cost of ownership. Mobile Enterprise Applications Mobile enterprise application software is the use of office software applications on a mobile platform in a way that adapts to different devices and networks. Many organizations use these applications to increase employee productivity and streamline business operations. The first common mobile enterprise application was the implementation of email. Now, 53% of emails are opened on a mobile device, a 45% increase in three years. The next wave of popular mobile enterprise application software was the advent of the CRM software. This allows salespeople to stay up-to-date with the business and manage customer relationships crucial to success from anywhere. Mobile procurement platform renders the same marketplace console in perfect optimization for all devices. Another enterprise software application being leveraged on a mobile platform is procurement. This trend is led by the consumer shopping experience. Over 36% of online sales on Black Friday in 2015 came from mobile shopping, according to IBM. As more shoppers are migrating to mobile applications, procurement departments need to keep up with user preferences. This mobile platform provides capabilities to complete the procurement process from start to finish. This includes searching for items and services, comparing vendors and prices, submitting purchase requests, approving requests, electronic signing, purchase orders and invoicing. Being able to accomplish this all in one place from any device significantly streamlines business procurement and operations. Users leverage mobile procurement for various reasons, and the tool can benefit businesses in many ways. User Convenience The clear advantage of using mobile procurement is the ability to use it anywhere from any device. This eliminates interruptions in the process or the need to complete a request from a single device. Users can search, compare and request items from anywhere. Suppliers can receive and sign purchase orders electronically. Checking inventory levels of physical locations provides a strong utility for mobile procurement. Save Time Mobile procurement saves time by reducing approval cycle time. A manager can make approvals from anywhere, not just his office. Users can request things they need when they need it, instead of after the fact, breaking corporate policy. Procurement now fills idle time rather than being a major item on a to-do list. This keeps employees and business moving forward. A fast procurement turnaround increases outcomes. Visibility Full visibility of suppliers and information helps businesses make informed decisions for better results and quicker processes. User analytics also help companies shop smarter in the long run. Native Apps vs. HTML5 Mobile interaction now exceeds desktop Web interaction by 9%. Now that mobile is the dominant form of online activity, mobile procurement is simply a natural step into today‚Äôs digital landscape. Mobile procurement platforms can be approached in two ways: native apps or Web apps using HTML5. Native Apps A native app is a mobile application developed specifically for use on mobile devices, launched directly from the home screen. In the United States, use of mobile apps greatly exceeds use of mobile Web browsing, but that trend is not worldwide. Using a native app requires development for all operating systems and brands. A fully operational native app needs to be designed for iOS, Android, Microsoft, all their various generations, and at different resolutions and orientations. For total success of an app, users will expect it to work on everything from a high-resolution tablet down to an Apple Watch. The other factor to consider with native apps is the way they access backend data. This is often more complex than a simple push to read data that takes place on a Web browser. Apps are developed, depending on their purpose and functionality, to access other applications such as the camera or local storage. Native apps can be the preferred use of mobile procurement in environments with either no IT access or highly secure networks. Financial institutions value privacy and security when considering mobile tools operating in their network. Oil and gas environments are often remote and require apps that can work with limited Internet access. A downside to mobile apps is the memory they occupy on a device. Because of this, many businesses will steer away from apps that require a great deal of storage. Web Apps and HTML5 A Web app is run by a browser and is really a responsive Web site. Responsive sites change and adapt to any digital environment, including operating system, screen size and orientation. This has several advantages for mobile procurement platforms. Responsive design can adjust to any browser on any device. The design is such that images, text, and user experience adjust based on the size and resolution of the platform. Adaptive web design is based on predetermined parameters for each platform. Both are ideal for any business that plans on interacting with customers on any type of mobile device. HTML, JavaScript and CSS3 seamlessly integrate backend systems with browsers and user interfaces. This creates an easy-to-use experience for all users on any device. Although some designs are scaled down, which can limit functionality, responsive and adaptive web design is easily accessible for any customer. And functionality is all about priority. If a scaled down site still performs the necessary functions, users will still find the advantages of increased turnarounds and time saving. The widespread availability of Wi-Fi increases the availability of HTML5 sites, reducing concerns about accessibility. With Wi-Fi everywhere, mobile procurement can happen in any place on a responsive site. Elegantly designed responsive and adaptive sites are the ideal solution for mobile procurement because of the simplicity of creating and implementing one. If a user‚Äôs experience is smooth and consistent, they will have no problem accessing a mobile procurement platform from any device. With the advancement of tools and technology it is currently possible to provide a native feel and minimal native feature set to your mobile products. Examples would be AngularJS, which allows for rapid web app development while preserving quality.

Background It is not known whether these were commissioned works nor, if so, who commissioned them: both Wyzewa & St. FoixT√©odor de Wyzewa and Georges de Saint-Foix, W.A. Mozart. Sa vie musicale et son oeuvre, vol. I, p. 521 (Paris, 1912).Th√©odore de Wyzewa and Georges de Saint-Foix, W.A. Mozart. Sa vie musicale et son oeuvre, vol. II, p. 4 (Paris, 1912). and EinsteinA. Einstein in KV3a, pp. 215 and 218 (Ann Arbor, 1947). assume an anonymous Milanese patron (possibly an amateur musician) to be involved. They based this conclusion on the notion that no clarinets were available in Salzburg at that time and that Mozart must have brought back the pieces from his third and last Italian journey during the winter of 1772-73. This notion, which was first asserted by Otto Jahn and then rather carelessly propagated by many scholars, has been put in considerable doubt by Kurt Birsak's research,K. Birsak, \\"Salzburg, Mozart und die Klarinette\\", Mitteilungen der Internationalen Stiftung Mozarteum 1985, 33, 40-47. which revealed that clarinets were mentioned in an Aufsatz und Specification deren Spielleithen nothbet√§rftigen Instrumenten in franz√∂sischem Thon [Essay and Specifications of the Instruments in the French Pitch required by Military Bandsmen] from 1769. However, Colin Lawson asserts that the writing for clarinet in K 166/159d (and to a lesser extent in K 186/159b) is incompatible with what would be expected from clarinettists in a mere military wind band, thereby adding credence to the theory that the works were inspired by an ensemble outside Salzburg. Indeed, in K 186/159b, the first of the two works, the clarinets are treated very often in the same way as the horns, providing pedal points and filling out the harmony without being given the opportunity for solo work, while the majority of the musical and lyrical statements are made by the oboes and English horns; in K 166/159d, on the other hand, the clarinets have become far more independent and are often given the upper voices, sometimes acting as a true pair of soloists accompanied only by the bass. The Neue Mozart Ausgabe (NMA) suggests that the works might have been commissioned by Grand Duke Leopold I of Tuscany, with whom Mozart unsuccessfully applied for employment.Neue Mozart Ausgabe, Series VII, Volume 1, p. VIII-XIV (1984). It has also been pointed out that the unusual scoring, most importantly the use of two English horns (Mozart had used them before only in the second version of the Divertimento K 113, also composed in Milan, and in La finta semplice, and after only in Il r√® pastoreM. Flothuis, \\"Mozart's Adagio f√ºr Englishhorn\\", Mitteilungen der Internationalen Stiftung Mozarteum 1967, 15, pp. 1-3.), strongly suggests a commission conceived for an already existing ensemble outside Salzburg.R. Hellyer, \\"Mozart's Harmoniemusik\\", The Music Review 1973, 34, pp. 146‚Äì156. Unfortunately, the fact that the autograph of K 166/159d explicitly mentions Salzburg does not make unravelling the genesis of these works easier. That the two pieces are companions is clear not only from the instrumentation but also from their structure: after the opening Allegro follow a Menuetto, a central Andante, an Adagio (thereby deviating from the more common sequence of two Menuetti encompassing the Andante) and a final Allegro structured as a Rondo. Although formally for ten winds, both divertimenti display a quite economical use of the ten instruments, considering that there are usually not more than two to three genuinely independent parts: oboes are often paired in thirds and combined with English horns likewise paired but playing an octave lower. Clarinets are often combined with oboes in sixths and the two bassoons always play in unison. The horns are confined to providing pedal notes or completing the chords, but in K 166/159d they do get a couple of opportunities to shine as a pair of soloists in typical horn calls. Further evidence for the kinship comes from the fact that in both pieces Mozart quotes from the ballet sketches Le gelosie del Seraglio K 135a (see below), now confirmed to have been composed by Joseph Starzer.W. Senn, \\"Mozarts Skizze der Ballettmusik zu Le gelosie del serraglio‚Äù, Acta Musicologica 1961, 33, pp. 169‚Äì192. These two divertimenti clearly comprise the first stage in Mozart's development as a composer of wind music, the second consisting of the five divertimenti for six winds (K 213, 240, 252/240a, 253 and 270), and the third of the large-scale serenades, K 361/370a, 375, and 388/384a, written in Vienna. K 186/159b and 166/159d display a considerably lighter, more recreational and perhaps even more casual spirit than the later works, true to the interpretation of the term divertimento. Divertimento in B-flat major, K 186/159b The autograph is preserved in the State Library Berlin ‚Äì Prussian Cultural Heritage (Music Department) and is undated. The work consists of the following five movements: * Allegro assai * Menuetto with Trio * Andante * Adagio * Allegro The rather straightforward opening Allegro assai is a L√§ndler that functions as an Intrada to the rest of the work. Originally, Mozart had a different Trio in mind, one written for two oboes and bassoon, but this was crossed out and replaced with another featuring a dialogue between the oboes and the English horns, supported by the bass;Erik Smith in \\"The Compleat Mozart. A Guide to the Musical Works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.\\", Neal Zaslaw (ed.), W.W. Norton & Company (New York, 1990). the original is available in the NMA. The theme of the final Allegro is identical to no. 31 in K 135a (see above). Although the explicit indication is missing from the autograph the horns in K 186/159b are corni alti in B [high horns in B-flat]. Divertimento in E-flat major, K 166/159d The autograph is preserved in the Biblioteka Jagiello≈Ñska Krak√≥w and is dated 24 March 1773. The work consists of the following five movements: * Allegro * Menuetto with Trio and Coda * Andante grazioso * Adagio * Allegro The opening Allegro features an exposition which is immediately followed by a recapitulation in varied harmony. The Trio is a true trio in that it is scored for the two English horns with bass only. The main theme of the Andante grazioso, an almost literal transcription of an operatic sinfonia by Giovanni Paisiello, is performed by the first oboe and first English horn an octave lower, supported by the bass. The Adagio is thematically linked to No. 30 in K 135a (see above) and generates a peculiar atmosphere with its long notes, legato line and great clarity. The final Allegro is a boisterous contredanse.

Early life Lewis attended Pickerington High School Central in Pickerington, Ohio. He became a star football player at the school and he earned scholarship offers from 17 Division I schools. During his senior year in 2012, Lewis was charged with two counts of rape. It was alleged that he raped a classmate in the basement of another classmate's house on December 2, 2011. The second charge alleged that Lewis raped the same classmate again in the back seat of her car on January 6, 2012. A jury acquitted Lewis of the first charge and deadlocked on the second charge, resulting in the judge declaring a mistrial. Lewis avoided a retrial by pleading guilty to making false statements to Pickerington police. The guilty plea to falsification resulted in the rape charge being dismissed. Lewis was sentenced to three years on probation. Afterwards, he opted to attend Jireh Preparatory Academy, a post-high-school college-prep school in Matthews, North Carolina. College career After spending one season at Jireh Preparatory Academy, Lewis committed to play college football at Bowling Green State University on January 6, 2014.

A. Juffali and Brothers, the largest privately owned enterprise in Saudi Arabia. He was the main founder of the Saudi central bank, the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA), and a member of the international advisory board of Chase Bank, and a board member of companies including Wells Fargo, and the International Business Machines Corporation (IBM). Early life and education Ahmed was born in Mecca on 1 January 1924, into a family of vast wealth and secrecy from Unayzah, Al-Qassim. The Al-Juffali are members of Bani Khalid dynasty, rulers of Eastern Arabia during the early 1600s to the late 1800s after military defeats against the Saudis. The Family are most notable for being direct descendants of KhƒÅlid ibn al-Walƒ´d. Ahmed was the third and most favored son of Sheikh Abdullah bin Ibrahim Al Juffali. His mother is Madawi bint Ibrahim Al Obeid which was responsible for the education of her sons. Sheikh Ahmed had two elder brothers, Ibrahim and Ali, which where overseeing their fathers electricity empire. Now known as Saudi Electricity Company. Ahmed attended homeschool in his fathers historic palace in the centre of Mecca, where he was educated by a selection of financial scholars and merchants. Ahmed was particularly interested in the topic of bringing international companies to the local market. Shortly after Ahmed had accumulated the knowledge needed, he had a vision and together with his brothers, embarked on a journey to introduce multinational companies to Saudi Arabia. Sheikh Ahmed developed great interest in various philanthropic and humanitarian causes. He launched multiple initiatives and programs that continue to serve various sectors of the community and participate in humanitarian development inside and outside the Middle East and neighboring Islamic countries. Ahmed was also fluent in three languages: Arabic, English, German. Sheikh Ahmed taught himself German in his youth as he would always carry a custom made German to Arabic dictionary. Business portfolio Sheikh Ahmed founded E. A. Juffali and Brothers, together with his brothers Ibrahim and Ali. Ahmed built a brand new gleaming office building in the middle of a desert wasteland in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Which now houses Daimler AG, Bosch, Dow Chemical, Fluor Corp, Carrier, DuPont, Ericsson, IBM, Liebherr, Michelin, Nissan, Siemens AG, Nabors Industries, and many more.  Humanitarian Projects  * The Help Centre: The Help Centre is a philanthropic non-governmental and non-profit organization dedicated to the welfare of persons with intellectual disabilities, from as early as birth to young adulthood and beyond. We seek means by which we can empower and integrate our children to participate fully and assume a rightful place in society, thereby attaining a fair chance at life. The Help Center began operations in November 1985. It soon became apparent that many children with intellectual disabilities required special services that were not available in either the hospitals or regular school settings. These children needed to be taught by specialists who understood the complexities of their problems and who could devise programs to help them live and integrate as independents within the larger community. Personal life Sheikh Ahmed had one wife, three sons and one daughter. He married Suad bint Ibrahim Al Husseini in the early-1970s from the Al-Husayni clan. Suad is currently undertaking various philanthropic contributions.

The governor started out his career in the military service of King Sithu II of Pagan (Bagan), rising to commander-in- chief of the royal army. He later became a chief minister at the royal court, and married a daughter of the king. In 1191, he was appointed governor of Kanba Myint, (modern Taungoo District), then a frontier region. He was the paternal great grandfather of Thawun Gyi and Thawun Nge, who founded Toungoo in 1279. Brief The royal chronicles say nothing about his early life except for his personal name, Yanman Nga Htwe ().Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 327 Based on his honorific, Yanman, he was likely an ethnic Mon.\\"Yanman\\" is a modern-day Burmese pronunciation of Rmen, which per (Aung-Thwin 2005: 46) was the Pagan period Old Mon name for the Mon people. \\"Nga\\" is the diminutive term used by the royals when addressing to those of lower status. The name Yaman Nga Htwe means \\"Commoner Htwe the Mon\\". The first mention of him the chronicles is as a member of the security detail of King Sithu II (r. 1174‚Äì1211). Chronicles say that Htwe made his name one day when the king was sailing upriver from Pagan (Bagan), and the royal barge was attacked by a large crocodile. Htwe jumped into the river, and wrestled the crocodile and killed it with the royal sceptre. The grateful king appointed him an officer in his army. There, Htwe served with distinction. He started out leading small expeditions to put down minor rebellions, and later became a commander leading major expeditions to more remote regions.All his expeditions reported in the chronicles were to put down the rebellions. He did not appear to have participated in Sithu's earlier expeditions that expanded the Pagan Empire to its greatest extent per (Lieberman 2003: 90‚Äì94). Chronicles say that he proved to be a successful commander, and usually brought home the rebel leader. Legends grew about his bravery: He supposedly wrestled and killed a tiger, and an elephant on separate occasions.Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 14‚Äì15 For his battlefield successes, the king rewarded him by granting a senior court title, Ananda Thuriya (Pali: Ananta Suriya),(Harvey 1925: 58) considers him chief minister of Sithu II. and his teenage daughter Saw Min Hla in marriage.According to the chronicles, (Maha Yazawin Vol. 1 2006: 220) and (Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 328), the royal daughter was the younger sister of Zeya Theinkha, then governor of Nyaungyan and later King Htilominlo (r. 1211‚Äì35). (Than Tun 1964: 129): Per a contemporary inscription, the name of Zeya Theinkha's only sister was A-Saw Min Hla, (or Saw Min Hla in modern Burmese), daughter of Queen Saw Mya Kan. However, the editors of (Maha Yazawin Vol. 1 2006: 219) note that another source, Sway-daw-zin Hmattan, states that Ananda Thuriya married Kyaung-Daw-The, daughter of junior queen Saw Sanay. If she was in fact Saw Min Hla, she was not older than 16. Since Saw Min Hla's elder brother Htilominlo was born in February 1175 per (Zata 1960: 40), she was most likely born in late 1175 at the earliest. Per the Toungoo Yazawin chronicle, she and Ananda Thuriya were already married by 1191 when the couple was sent off to Kanba Myint. The minister-general built the Laymyethna Temple in Pagan, inscribing a curse on all those who should injure his dedication.Harvey 1925: 58 Lemyethna Temple in Bagan, donated by Ananda Thuriya and his wife in 1223 According to the Toungoo region's chronicle Toungoo Yazawin, in 1191, Ananda Thuriya was given in fief a frontier region called Kanba Myint (·ÄÄ·Äô·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äï·Ä´·Ä∏·Äô·Äº·ÄÑ·Ä∑·Ä∫), a small settlement on the Swa, a tributary to the Paunglaung river. The king made the appointment while travelling through the region on his return trip from Pegu (Bago) in the south. He observed that the hitherto frontier region, about 250 km from the Mon-speaking Pegu, was now populated with Mon and Burmese speakers, and decided to closely administer the region. According to historian Sein Lwin Lay, the king likely considered his son-in-law Ananda Thuriya, a proven military commander and probably an ethnic Mon (based on his name), a perfect fit for the region.Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 15‚Äì16 Except for a couple of pagoda renovations, not much is known about his years as governor at Kanba Myint. He died in an unknown year, and was succeeded by his son Min Hla Saw. In 1279, two of his great grandsons Thawun Gyi and Thawun Nge founded Toungoo (Taungoo), about 40 km south of Kanba Myint.

Methylammonium lead halides (MALHs) are solid compounds with perovskite structure and a chemical formula of CH3NH3PbX3, where X = I, Br or Cl. They have potential applications in solar cells, lasers, light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, radiation detectors, scintillator, magneto-optical data storage and hydrogen production. Properties and synthesis In the CH3NH3PbX3 cubic crystal structure the methylammonium cation (CH3NH3+) is surrounded by PbX6 octahedra. The X ions are not fixed and can migrate through the crystal with an activation energy of 0.6 eV; the migration is vacancy assisted. The methylammonium cations can rotate within their cages. At room temperature the ions have the CN axis aligned towards the face directions of the unit cells and the molecules randomly change to another of the six face directions on a 3 ps time scale. Growth of a CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal in gamma-butyrolactone at 110 ¬∞C. The yellow color originates from the lead(II) iodide precursor. Growth of a CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystal in dimethylformamide at 80 ¬∞C. The solubility of MALHs strongly decreases with increased temperature: from 0.8 g/mL at 20 ¬∞C to 0.3 g/mL at 80 ¬∞C for CH3NH3PbI3 in dimethylformamide. This property is used in the growth of MALH single crystals and films from solution, using a mixture of CH3NH3X and PbX2 powders as the precursor. The growth rates are 3‚Äì20 mm3/hour for CH3NH3PbI3 and reach 38 mm3/hour for CH3NH3PbBr3 crystals. The resulting crystals are metastable and dissolve in the growth solution when cooled to room temperature. They have bandgaps of 2.18 eV for CH3NH3PbBr3 and 1.51 eV for CH3NH3PbI3, while their respective carrier mobilities are 24 and 67 cm2/(V¬∑s). Their thermal conductivity is exceptionally low, ~0.5 W/(K¬∑m) at room temperature for CH3NH3PbI3.  Photodecomposition and thermal decomposition of CH3NH3PbX3 Initially, a proposed decomposition pathway mechanism for CH3NH3PbI3 in presence of water releasing CH3NH2 and HI gases was broadly adopted by researchers in perovskite solar cell. Later, it was found that the major gases released during high temperature (> 360 ¬∞C) thermal degradation of CH3NH3PbI3 are methyl iodide (CH3I) and ammonia (NH3). :{CH3NH3PbI3(s)} ->[\\\\Delta] {PbI2(s)} + {CH3I(g)} + {NH3(g)} In 2017, it has been inferred using in situ XPS measurements that in the presence of water vapour, CH3NH3I salt can not be a product of the degradation of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite. Similar high temperature degradation reaction has been confirmed for CH3NH3PbBr3 :{CH3NH3PbBr3(s)} ->[\\\\Delta] {PbBr2(s)} + {CH3Br(g)} + {NH3(g)} Furthermore, high resolution mass spectrometry measurements at low temperature conditions (< 100 ¬∞C) compatible with photovoltaic operation found that CH3NH3PbI3 undergoes reversible, :{CH3NH3PbI3(s)} <=>[\\\\Delta,h u] {PbI2(s)} + {Pb^0(s)} + {I2(g)} +{CH3NH2(g)} + {HI(g)} and irreversible chemical decomposition reactions under vacuum when illumination or heat pulses are applied. :{CH3NH3PbI3(s)} ->[\\\\Delta,h u] {PbI2(s)} + +{CH3I(g)} + {NH3(g)} Recently, a method to quantify the intrinsic chemical stability of arbitrarily mixed hybrid halide perovskites has been proposed.

Music Directors *William Harrod *Patrick Flynn *Gurer Aykal *Albert-George Schramm *Andrews Sill *Tomasz Golka *David Cho  History  In October 1946, the Lubbock Symphony Orchestra was organized and presented its first concert under the baton of founding Conductor William A. Harrod. At that time, the orchestra was entirely a volunteer effort. In 1967, the LSO became a professional organization with paid musicians. Mr. Harrod continued to conduct the orchestra through the spring of 1984. He has been followed by a number of dynamic, and talented conductors including Andrews Sill and Tomasz Golka. The current Music Director and Conductor is David Cho, who began his tenure with the LSO fall 2012. The Lubbock Symphony Orchestra is now classified by the American Symphony Orchestra League as a group VI Orchestra. William A. Harrod was introduced to Lubbock while he was in the Air Force and a member of the Air Force Band. He formed a dance band for the enlisted men and women who also were stationed in Lubbock, and soon was \\"asked to form a community orchestra by the local preachers,\\" he said. \\"The thing that kept us going early on was the Texas Tech Band and its wonderful musicians. The problem was the lack of strings,\\" he said. \\"Lubbock only had school bands back then, not school orchestras, so I had to put together a scrub team of fiddle players.\\" Other Lubbock citizens played major roles in the development of the orchestra, with Harrod more than once citing the contributions of Asher Thompson and Charley Pope. The orchestra, while founded in 1946, did not become a professional, paid organization until 1967. That played havoc with Harrod's attempts to even hold rehearsals. \\"That was by far the toughest part,\\" Harrod said. \\"You see, I could schedule a rehearsal for a concert, but never know for certain who all would be showing up. Musicians would come up to me and say, 'Mr. Harrod, I can play in Amarillo or Abilene or Roswell (N.M.) and all of them will pay me.' They deserved to be paid. That went on until Asher Thompson and Charley Pope made arrangements for the Lubbock Symphony Orchestra members to at least receive token payments,\\" he continued.  Education and Outreach  For 65 years the Lubbock Symphony Orchestra has engaged, educated and inspired thousands of diverse school-age students and adult learners by means of a comprehensive program of strategic education initiatives. The Lubbock Symphony Orchestra is committed to the precept that music changes lives. The organization affirms proven historic research indicating that music education/participation fosters learning using the multiple intelligences. The Lubbock Symphony Orchestra is likewise committed to the precept that every individual is deserving of investment regardless of ethnic, cultural, and socio-economic background. More than 12,300 learners are served annually through transformational education programs. Each year, the LSO invites students in grades five through twelve to experience a live symphonic performance! Public, private, and home schools from Lubbock and the surrounding communities participate in these free interactive education concerts, which are led by Music Director David Cho. Additionally, the LSO sponsors teaching artists that currently work in 45 classrooms on 12 Lubbock Independent School District campuses, reaching approximately 1035 students. Plans are underway to expand the program to all LISD elementary schools. The LSO also brings music to the schools through the Chamber Ensemble Outreach Program. The educational brass and woodwind quintets and string quartet are composed of LSO musicians and Texas Tech University graduate students. They perform for local third and fourth graders and provide an informative and interactive musical experience. Students are introduced to each instrument and experience a live performance in an up-close and personal setting. These small ensembles also perform in other settings throughout the community including assisted living facilities, after-school programs, and the Lubbock County Juvenile Justice Center.  David Cho, Music Director  Born in Seoul, Korea, David immigrated to the United States in 1985. David received a variety of music lessons during his childhood in Palos Verdes, California before focusing his energy exclusively on the piano. He later attended Oberlin College and Conservatory where he received his Bachelor of Music in Piano Performance. In 1996, David won the E. Nakamichi Concerto Competition at the Aspen Music Festival and was awarded the Arthur Dann Prize at the Oberlin Conservatory. In 1999, while acquiring his Master of Music in Piano Performance at the Peabody Institute at Johns Hopkins University, David was invited by Robert Spano and Seiji Ozawa to attend the prestigious Tanglewood Music Center as a Merrill Lynch Conducting Fellow. David was then invited by Larry Rachleff to study at Rice University where he served as guest conductor for the Shepherd School Orchestras while acquiring his Master of Music in Instrumental Conducting.

He has been a member of the Parliament of Tripoli.  Biography  Fayez Mustafa was born on 20 February 1960 in Tripoli. He comes from a wealthy family of Kouloughli descent which owned shops and vast amount of land. Al- Sarraj himself is said to be of Turkish origin. His father, Mostafa al-Sarraj was a minister during the Libyan Monarchy. Fayez al-Sarraj trained as an architect and during the Colonel Muammar Gaddafi era he was employed at the Housing Ministry. In 2014, he served as the Minister of Housing and Utilities in the Maiteeq Cabinet of the GNC. His opponents criticized his political appointment as a foreign imposition. An article that appeared in 2016 in The Guardian newspaper quoted Guma el-Gamaty, a member of Libya Dialogue, the UN- chaired body that created the new government, saying that al-Sarraj was \\"expected to ask for help to combat ISIS and train Libyan units.\\" Following Libya's 2014 elections, the government became split between the New General National Congress in Tripoli and the internationally recognized legislature of the House of Representatives in Tobruk.  Presidency  In early October 2015 the United Nations envoy to Libya, Bernardino Le√≥n, proposed a National Unity Government for Libya, to be led by the Presidential Council of Fayez al- Sarraj, as prime minister, three deputies from the country's eastern, western, and southern regions, and two ministers. However, this national unity government was rejected by the internationally recognized legislature in Tobruk and the rival government in Tripoli. Fayez al-Sarraj, and six members of the Presidential Council and proposed cabinet arrived in Tripoli on 30 March 2016. The following day, it was reported that the GNA had taken control of the prime ministerial offices and that the GNC appointed prime minister Khalifa al-Ghawil had fled to Misrata. On 14 October 2016, forces loyal to GNC took over the building of the High Council of State and announced the comeback of Ghawil cabinet Then, fighting occurred between Sarraj loyalists and Ghawil forces. On 16 September, al-Sarraj stated that he will be stepping down from his position by the end of October 2020. This has come after one month of protests in Tripoli.  Government of National Accord  Sarraj with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, 16 May 2016 Sarraj has been Prime Minister of the Government of National Accord since its installment in December 2015 as part of a United Nations-led political agreement. Prior to his initial arrival in Tripoli in March 2016, Sarraj survived two separate assassination attempts. Over the past two years, the GNA has struggled to gain a foothold as a legitimate institution of authority inside the country, and Libya has remained divided. The government's initial proposed group of ministers was rejected by the House of Representatives (HoR), leading Sarraj to form a government that received a no confidence vote from the HoR. Infighting among rival militias has only intensified, and Libyan citizens have faced economic hardships, including inflation, corruption, and smuggling, that are \\"melting away the country's cash reserves\\". The United Nations representatives who initially formed the unity government have since expressed concern over its ability to make progress. In December 2016, the Security Council noted the \\"limited authority\\" of the GNA and stated that \\"the Libyan Political Agreement did not fulfill the expectations. The implementation has stalled.\\" Months following this statement, an April 2017 U.N. Security Council meeting summary cautioned that \\"Libya could relapse into conflict\\" and said the government has struggled to \\"deliver basic services while endeavoring to fight terrorism, illegal migration and oil smuggling.\\" In an attempt to make the government more effective, reports have surfaced throughout 2017 of a consensus to restructure the GNA and overall Libyan Political Agreement. In July 2018, Libya rejected European Union's plan aimed at stopping migration from Libya. On 10 April 2019, United Nations chief Ant√≥nio Guterres said, at the UN headquarters, that he still hopes to avoid a \\"bloody battle for Tripoli\\".

The album solely contains compositions by Cole Porter performed by his contemporaries who were also under contract to RCA Victor and its subsidiary, Bluebird. In addition, it features two tracks recorded by Porter himself in 1934 for the Victor Corporation and overdubbed with additional instrumentation by Vince Giordano and his Nighthawks. Both overdubbed tracks have been featured in video games: \\"You're the Top\\" in 2007's BioShock and \\"Anything Goes\\" in 2008's Fallout 3, 2015's Fallout 4 and 2018's Fallout 76. The album was released just prior to the July 2, 2004 premier of the Cole Porter biopic De-Lovely starring Kevin Kline. The original 1934 version of \\"You're the Top\\" plays over the end credits. Recording From the liner notes written by jazz critic Will Friedwald: \\"What's special about this collection is that the selections you will hear are of Porter's own era, the performances that he himself heard when the songs were still fresh...Yet though the range of performers is extremely diverse, they all have two things in common. First, there's the unifying factor of Porter's music itself - whether it's being essayed by Sonny Rollins, Leo Reisman or Dinah Shore, or blown up through the a [sic] big band, these are the important Cole Porter songs from his own era. The second is that all these artists were under contract to RCA Victor, the recording company committed to recording Porter's music, including those sections featuring Cole Porter himself.\\" \\"This current collection illustrates Cole Porter's eternal topicality in more ways than one; now, for the first time, we have Cole Porter, singing his own songs, with full orchestral accompaniment. Porter himself was far from a virtuoso pianist like his younger contemporary George Gershwin, nor did he take the occasional opportunity to put his voice down on wax, like Harold Arlen. He enjoyed singing and playing his own songs at parties, but that was principally when he was young and unknown; once the great stars began singing his music, he no longer felt the urge to do so himself. In 1934 and '35, Porter recorded eight rather modest tracks for the Victor Corporation, including, most importantly, a few future standards from his most recent Broadway hit, Anything Goes, The tracks sound like songwriter demos, and, as comedian Bert Lahr (who starred in two Porter shows), observed, \\"Cole was a horrible piano player. He played with a slow, wooden tempo. If you didn't know who it was, you'd think it was a learner.\\" \\"But at the same time, this is authentic Cole Porter, and thanks to producer Barry Feldman and bandleader and multi-instrumentalist Vince Giordano, the Cole Porter Victor tracks are no longer mere historical curiosities. Now we can hear what Porter would have sounded like had he taken his singing seriously enough to work with a stylish, modern dance orchestra of the art deco era. To make sure the band parts would have an absolutely authentic mid-'30s sound, Mr. Giordano unearthed six different charts on each song, including four from the band book of the period bandleader Arnold Johnson (who, coincidentally, had employed a young Harold Arlen as arranger and vocalist a few years earlier). Mr. Giordano and his aide-de-camp banjo- guitarist John Gill combined aspects of the different arrangements, and then finessed them to fit around the Porter recordings.\\" \\"Where the orchestrations are for dance purposes, which is to say that they're predominantly instrumentals, with brief one-chorus vocal refrains in the middle (an usually a modulation to the vocal), the Porter performances are essentially vocal from beginning to end. Adjustments had to be made for the key for Anything Goes (Porter sings, surprisingly, in B flat, a full step below the published key of C, which is the key that the orchestrations are in). Vince notes that this idea of improving upon a classical recording after the fact is also part of the Victor Records heritage; a decade or so after the death of Enrico Caruso, Victor house musical director Nathaniel Shilkret added a modern, electrically recorded symphony orchestra to some of the great tenor's originally acoustically recorded masters. Nearly 70 years later, Giordano and his Nighthawks - now expanded to include a three-piece string section - listened with headphones to the composer's performance of 70 years ago to make sure everything synced up perfectly.\\" Packaging and artwork The CD is styled to resemble the black and gold \\"scroll\\" label of the Victor Talking Machine Company. The back of the liner notes features a facsimile of the original 78 rpm shellac record and record sleeve of the American issue of Cole Porter's vocal rendition of \\"You're the Top\\" (Catalog No. 24766). The liner notes also contain scans of portions of the 1934 Victor recording contract signed by Cole Porter and company president Eli Wallerstein along with the recording session index card for \\"Anything Goes\\" (Catalog No. 24825).

Resistance arteries are usually arterioles or end- points of arteries. Having thick muscular walls and narrow lumen they contribute the most to the resistance to blood flow. Degree of the contraction of muscles in the wall of a resistance artery is directly connected to the size of the lumen.  Definition  Functionally from physiological point of view blood vessels can be divided in several categories * Buffer vessels ‚Äì aorta, middle-sized arteries * Resistance vessels ‚Äì arterioles, pre- and postcapillaries. * Metabolic vessels ‚Äì capillaries * Capacitance vessels ‚Äì veins Particular feature of resistance vessels is ability to change lumen crossectional area and influence blood pressure. Human arteries or arterioles that are around 0.2 mm or smaller contribute to creation of the blood flow resistance and are called resistance arteries.Cardiovascular Physiology By William R. Milnor  Physiology  The small arteries have a task of regulating local blood flow in every part of a body. They do so by adjustments of their diameter. Quick functional changes are accomplished by contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle cells in the wall of the small arteries.  Pathophysiology  Resistance arteries are the target of a disease in case of stenosis (narrowing of the lumen) or arteriosclerosis. In both cases, normal functionality of resistance arteries is lost. Chronic changes in diameter result from vascular remodeling - reshaping of the vascular wall, where existing elements are reorganized, new elements are added or elements are broken down. The regulation of arterial diameter and wall structure is a continuous process of adaptation to changing needs, ranging from exercise to development of the body. This adaptation may malfunction: too small a diameter of the resistance vessels relates to insufficient tissue perfusion as well as hypertension. The vascular wall consists of amongst others the vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells that line the lumen, and elastic fibers and other extracellular matrix elements. Physical forces form an important part of the adaptation mechanisms of small arteries: Blood pressure causes distension of the matrix elements, but also induces contraction of the smooth muscle cells and production of more cells and more matrix. Blood flow is sensed by the endothelial cells, which release factors such as nitric oxide that cause relaxation and remodeling towards larger diameters. Forces, cells, and matrix, therefore, form a triangle of mutual effects that underlie vascular adaptation.

Constituted by forts Diou and Girardin, the group is part of the first fortified belt of forts around Metz and had its baptism of fire in late 1944, when the Battle of Metz occurred.  Historical context  The fortified group of forts known as Saint-Quentin belongs to the first fortified belt of Metz designed during Second French Empire by Napol√©on III. The first fortified belt consists of Fort Saint-Privat (1870), Fort de Queuleu (1867), Fort des Bordes (1870), Fort de Saint-Julien (1867), Fort Gambetta, D√©roul√®de, Fort Decaen, Fort de Plappeville (1867) and St. Quentin (1867), most of them unfinished or in skeletal form in 1870, when the Franco-Prussian War began.

Construction and facilities  The fortified group Saint-Quentin is one of \\"detached forts\\", a concept developed by the engineering lieutenant colonel Raymond Adolphe S√©r√© de Rivi√®res in France and Hans Alexis von Biehler in Germany. The goal was to form a discontinuous enclosure around Metz with strong artillery batteries spaced with a range of guns. The fortified group spans 77 hectaresG√©rard Bornemann: La reconversion du patrimoine militaire dans l'agglom√©ration messine, in Renaissance du vieux Metz, bull. n¬∞127, avril 2003 (p.6-7). on a west-facing plateau. With 72 buildings and a built area of 25,600 square meters, it is one of the largest fortified wholes of the first belt. Saint-Quentin was initially not designed as a fortified group, but this resulted from the combination of two strong classical forts, Fort Diou and Fort Girardin. It was partially built by the French between 1868 and 1871 and extensively developed by the Germans between 1872 and 1892. Its topographic position on Mont Saint-Quentin overlooking the city of Metz made it a major strategic position for the French and German staffs. It is separated from Fort de Plappeville by the commune of Lessy. The fortified group Saint-Quentin consists of three parts, the fort Manstein,During the Franco-Prussian war of 1870, General \\"von Manstein (1805-1877) participated in the battle of Saint-Privat. or fort Girardin to the west, Fort Saint-Quentin in the center, and fort Diou,Paul Emile Diou (1855-1914) is a French brigade general born in Metz. or Ostfort, to the East. The fort Diou, trapezoidal, was built by the French from 1868 to 1870 and completed after 1872 by the Prussians. Among the forts of Metz it is the only French work designed by Lieutenant Colonel S√©r√© de Rivi√®res. The fort could accommodate a contingent of 617 men and forty pieces of artillery. Its corners are bastioned and a deep dry moat prohibits access. On a plateau, Plateau Barracks, or Fort Saint-Quentin covers the junction between the Ostfort and Fort von Manstein. Built between 1872 and 1874, it was surrounded by moats north and south. The Plateau Barracks consists of a principal barracks buried on three sides, a powder magazine and several fortins. These buildings are connected by covered ways, where a rail track of 60 cm wide allows trucks to carry equipment and ammunition. Behind the parapets, many ramps of artillery allow positioning of outdoor artillery. To the west of the plateau, the Germans built Feste von Manstein from 1872 to 1874 to control the Moselle valley to the south and the neck of Lessy to the north. Pentagonal, Fort von Manstein features a dry moat on three sides. It could accommodate a contingent of more than 600 men and several guns behind its parapets. It also has several observation towers. Work continued until 1898.  Successive assignments  While under German control the fort was a training camp for Prussian troops. From 1890 the relief of the garrison was guaranteed by the fort troops Corps XVI stationed at Metz and Thionville. From 1914 to 1918, the fort is spared any fighting. It serves as a relay for the German soldiers at the front post. Because of its proximity to the city of Metz, the fort, taken by the French army in 1919 is partly disused before Second World War. In 1939, it serves as PC Air Defence of the Territory. Taken over by the Germans in June 1940, it served for warehouses and a training ground during World War II. Beginning in September 1944, during the Battle of Metz, German troops reorganized its defense, and integrated it into the defensive system set up around Metz. Again abandoned after 1945, the fort is still a closed military zone. Fort Diou serves as a radio relay today.

Like the Fort de Plappeville, the Fortified group Driant and the Fortified group Joan of Arc, the fortified group of Mont-Saint-Quentin had its baptism of fire between September and December 1944, during the Battle of Metz. On 3 September 1944, Lieutenant General Walther Krause, then commander of the fortress of Metz, established his combat command post at Fort de Plappeville.The staff of the 462th Infantry Division will locate later in the Fortified group Joan of Arc. This fort was in the center of the defenses of Metz, well defended by the fort to the south Manstein (Girardin) held at that time by the SS colonel Joachim von Siegroth.Ren√© Caboz, La bataille de Metz, √âditions Pierron, Sarreguemines, 1984, p. 133. During the three months of fighting, Fort Plappeville, under the command of the artillery Colonel Vogel, and that of Saint-Quentin, successively commanded by Colonels Siegroth Von, Von Richter and St√∂ssel, will cover each other, blocking access by US troops to the valley Moselle, west of Metz. The US offensive launched September 7, 1944 on the west line forts of Metz is cut short. American troops eventually stopped on the Moselle despite taking two bridgeheads south of Metz. The forts, were better defended against them than they had thought, and US troops were figuratively out of breath. General McLain, in agreement with the General Walker, decided to suspend the attacks, pending further plans of the General Staff of the 90 Infantry Division.Hugh M.

On November 9, 1944, as a prelude to the assault on Metz, as many as 1,299 heavy bombers, B-17s and B-24s, dump 3,753 tons of bombs, and 1,000 to 2,000 \\"livres\\" on fortifications and strategic points in the combat zone of IIIrd army.G√©n√©ral Jean Colin, Contribution √† l‚Äôhistoire de la lib√©ration de la ville de Metz ; Les combats du fort Driant (septembre-d√©cembre 1944), Acad√©mie nationale de Metz, 1963, p. 13. Most bombers, having dropped bombs without visibility at over 20,000 feet, miss their objectives. In Metz, the 689 loads of bombs dropped on the seven forts of Metz, designated as priority targets, cause merely collateral damage.Hugh M. Cole, The Lorraine Campaign, Center of Military History, Washington, 1950, p. 424. The underground fortifications, such as the Mont Saint-Quentin, offer good resistance to the American bombings, which include incendiary bombs. Despite the efforts of the combative troops of the 462th Infantry Division, the forts fall one after the other, as a result of fighting or simply running out of food and ammunition. The final assault on Metz happens at dawn on November 14, 1944. The M101 howitzer from 359th Field Artillery Battalion opened fire on the area located on either side of the Fortified group Jeanne-d'Arc, between the Fort Francis de Guise and the fort Driant to pave the way for 379th Infantry regiment whose goal is to reach the Moselle. The attack is focused on fort Jeanne-d‚ÄôArc which ends up being encircled by US troops. After two deadly counterattacks, the men of Major Voss, belonging to the 462th ID return soon to the fortified group Jeanne-d'Arc. In the afternoon of November 15, 1944, the men of 1217th Grenadier-Regiment ¬´ Richter ¬ª, consisting of Security Regiment 1010 and those of 1515th Grenadier-Regiment ¬´ St√∂ssel ¬ª of the 462e Volksgrenadier division, made several unsuccessful attempts to push the Americans behind the line Canrobert.

German grenadiers, who had to withdraw on a line between the point of support Leipzig and the Fort Plappeville finally withdraw in disorder to Metz, leaving only some detachments in the forts. On November 16, 1944, the US attack continues between forts Jeanne D'Arc and Francois de Guise. On the evening of November 17, 1944, the situation is critical for the commander of the fortress of Metz, General Heinrich Kittel. The men still fighting of Grenadier-Regiment 1215 ¬´ St√∂ssel ¬ª are now identified in the fortified group of Saint-Quentin. November 18, 1944 378 Infantry Regiment launches the first simultaneous attack on the forts of Saint-Quentin and Fort de Plappeville. On the plateau and in the fort, the men of the 462e Volks-Grenadier-Division were harassed by four days of continuous fighting. Yet they defend every inch on the plateau, bunker by bunker. After a short respite, a second American attack, more deadly than the first, takes the outsides of the fort, forcing the defenders to hide in the precincts of the fort for protection from artillery fire from US troops now ready on the plateau of Plappeville. On November 19, 1944 378th Infantry regiment of 95th Infantry Division frontally attack the new Fort de Plappeville and Fort St. Quentin. The attack failed, despite the enthusiasm of US troops. The 378th Infantry regiment is immediately relieved and replaced the next day by the 379th Infantry regiment. Despite the support of continuous gunfire, the forts still resist the attack of the 379th Infantry regiment. On 21 November 1944, the two advanced batteries, located between the fortified group Mont Saint-Quentin and the Fort Plappeville are finally taken, but the forts still resist. An air attack on the two forts is then considered, but it is canceled the same day, for lack of available squadrons. The main objective of the 95th Infantry Division is now the city of Metz, the forts are just surrounded and neutralized by covering fire. Metz is liberated on November 22, 1944, but the forts Plappeville and St. Quentin still resist for two long weeks in accordance with the orders of the F√ºhrer. The fort of St. Quentin, which still had 21 officers, 124 warrant officers and 458 enlisted men, finally surrendered the 6 December 1944 to 5th Infantry division of General Irwin. As night fell on this cold winter day, Colonel von Stossel symbolically submitted his Luger pistol to the commander of 2nd Battalion 11th Infantry regiment, the lieutenant-colonel Dewey B.

Fort Plappeville, which had more than 200 men, surrendered the next day, December 7, 1944. The fort Jeanne-d‚ÄôArc was the last of the forts of Metz to disarm, on December 13, 1944. Determined German resistance, bad weather and floods, inopportunity, and a general tendency to underestimate the firepower of the fortifications of Metz, helped slow the US offensive, giving the opportunity to the German Army to withdraw in good order to the Saarland.Hugh M. Cole, The Lorraine Campaign, Center of Military History, Washington, 1950, p. 448. The objective of the German staff, which was to stall the US troops at Metz for the longest possible time before they could reach the front of the Siegfried Line, was largely achieved.

He was the younger brother of Kan≈ç Tan'y≈´, with whom he completed a number of prominent commissions for the Tokugawa shogunate.

In February 1944, the 147th Regiment landed in nearby Sumbawa island. The divisional headquarters were established on the Sumbawa island. The remaining 145th Regiment was unable to be transported and instead was diverted from Saipan in June 1944 to Iwo Jima under the Lieutenant General Tadamichi Kuribayashi's Ogasawara Corps where it was wiped out in the Battle of Iwo Jima in February - March 1945.

Louis Slusky opened Playland Park circa 1940 at 9200 South Main. It is popularly remembered for its wooden roller coaster, The Skyrocket. Texas' first elevated monorail train (1956) briefly operated near the park. Next to the park was an adjoining stock-car race track known as Playland Speedway. Slusky also facilitated the miniature children‚Äôs train located in Houston‚Äôs Hermann Park. This train may have originated from Playland Park. Playland Park closed in 1967. Playland Park, Houston should not be confused with the Playland Park located in San Antonio, Texas which started around the same time and later had a wooden roller coaster similarly named The Rocket. The Skyrocket The Skyrocket was a wooden roller coaster relocated to Playland Park and opened on September, 1941. Originally opened in 1924 at Houston‚Äôs former Luna Park, at that time it was billed as the ‚Äúlargest‚Äù roller coaster in the country with a reported length of , height of and a drop of . The original construction cost (1924) was $75,000. The relocation from Luna Park to Playland Park is believed to be the last Roller Coaster project John A. Miller was involved with. Miller died in Houston in 1941 while working on this project. The roller coaster, now claiming to be the largest in the South, appears to have been operational until some time between 1962 and 1964. By 1964 the roller coaster was partially removed and no longer operational. This was to make room for a new large building behind the park where the race track was formerly located. The remainder of the roller coaster was torn down after the park finally closed. Playland Speedway The race track started ca. 1948. Various races and demolition derbies were held at the track. Local racing talent A. J. Foyt raced there. In 1959 a race car crashed through a fence killing three people including co-owner Sam Slusky. Within a few years of the crash, the race track closed. Many speculate the fatalities contributed to this decision. By 1962 the grand stands were removed and by 1964 a new building was constructed where the track once existed. Alternate names include Playland Park Speedway and Playland Park Stadium. Closure The park closed in 1967, just prior to AstroWorld opening in Houston in 1968. Prior to closure, the race track was long gone and the roller coaster had ceased to operate. By 1973, the location was empty. Years later it was eventually redeveloped as retail space and apartments. In the early 1970s, nearby AstroWorld considered purchasing and relocating an existing wooden roller coaster to that park but from Coney Island. Ultimately AstroWorld built its own wooden roller coaster, the Texas Cyclone which opened in 1976.

It compares the forecast direction (upward or downward) to the actual realized direction. It is defined by the following formula: : \\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_t \\\\mathbf{1}_{\\\\sgn(A_t - A_{t-1}) = \\\\sgn(F_t - A_{t-1})} where At is the actual value at time t and Ft is the forecast value at time t. Variable N represents number of forecasting points. The function \\\\sgn(\\\\cdot) is sign function and \\\\mathbf{1} is the indicator function. In simple words, MDA provides the probability that the under study forecasting method can detect the correct direction of the time series. MDA is a popular metric for forecasting performance in economics and finance.Pesaran, M. H., & Timmermann, A. (2004). How costly is it to ignore breaks when forecasting the direction of a time series?. International Journal of Forecasting, 20(3), 411-425 Schnader, M. H., & Stekler, H. O. (1990). Evaluating predictions of change. Journal of Business, 99-107 MDA is used in economics applications where the economist is often interested only in directional movement of variable of interest. As an example in macroeconomics, a monetary authority who wants to know the direction of the inflation, to raise or decrease interest rates if inflation is predicted to rise or drop respectively.Greer, M. (2003). Directional accuracy tests of long-term interest rate forecasts. International Journal of Forecasting, 19(2), 291-298.

On economic evaluation of directional forecasts. International Journal of Forecasting, 27(4), 1058-1065. Comparison to other forecasting metrics Many techniques, such as mean absolute percentage error or median absolute deviation, evaluate forecasting and provided information about the accuracy and value of the forecasts. While accuracy, as measured by quantitative errors, is important, it may be more crucial to accurately forecast the direction of change. Directional accuracy is similar to a binary evaluation. The metric only consider the upward or downward direction in the time series and is independent of quantitive value of increase or decrease. For example, will prices rise or fall? How much it will increase or decrease can be detected by other forecasting metrics.Sinclair, T. M., Stekler, H. O., & Kitzinger, L. (2010).

After the Chimei and L√ºlin \\"Green Forest\\" agrarian rebellion movements collectively brought down Wang Mang's short Xin dynasty (9-23 CE), the Chimei forces allowed the L√ºlin leader Liu Xuan to become Gengshi Emperor (r. 23-25) and restore the dynasty.
