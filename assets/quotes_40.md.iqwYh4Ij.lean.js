Built in 1939, the two-story brick and limestone building is Reading's only structure built as part of a Public Works Administration project. The site on which it was built was acquired by the town sometime before 1848, and served as its poor farm. With fifteen classrooms, the school replaced three smaller wood-frame schoolhouses in the town's school system, and was its first fire-resistant structure. The school, designed by local architect George H. Sidebottom, is stylistically a mix of Colonial Revival, Classical Revival, and Art Deco styles. The walls are predominantly brick, with limestone and wooden trim, and the cornice is decorated with modillions. These features, and the 12-over-12 double hung windows, are typical Colonial Revival features. The building has a basic U-shaped plan, with projecting pavilions on the left and right ends, and the front facade. The legs of the U are irregular: the right-side leg is a rectangular ell, while the left side one is an irregular polygonal shape. The projecting pavilions are a typical Classical Revival feature. Art Deco surrounds frame the windows on these pavilions, and there are brick pilasters that frame the Art Deco surrounds on the entryways that are centered in each pavilion. The building served Reading as an elementary school until 1984, when it was closed due to declining enrollment. The school board leased it to a variety of tenants, and turned it over to the town selectmen in 1989, who sold the building in 1995.

It describes how patterns in nature, such as stripes and spirals, can arise naturally from a homogeneous, uniform state. The theory, which can be called a reaction‚Äìdiffusion theory of morphogenesis, has become a basic model in theoretical biology.Harrison, L.G. (1993). Kinetic Theory of Living Pattern. Cambridge University Press. Such patterns have come to be known as Turing patterns. For example, it has been postulated that the protein VEGFC can form Turing patterns to govern the formation of lymphatic vessels in the zebrafish embryo. Reaction‚Äìdiffusion systems Reaction‚Äìdiffusion systems have attracted much interest as a prototype model for pattern formation. Patterns such as fronts, spirals, targets, hexagons, stripes and dissipative solitons are found in various types of reaction- diffusion systems in spite of large discrepancies e.g. in the local reaction terms. Such patterns have been dubbed \\"Turing patterns\\".Wooley, T. E., Baker, R. E., Maini, P. K., Chapter 34, Turing's theory of morphogenesis. In Reaction‚Äìdiffusion processes form one class of explanation for the embryonic development of animal coats and skin pigmentation.

It was established in 1923 as a state demonstration forest. It contains the Indian Creek Recreation Area and the Alexander State Forest Headquarters Building, constructed in 1935, is on the National Register of Historic Places. History In 1923, the state of Louisiana purchased 2,068 acres from Mrs. Elise Polk Burrows, and named the land Alexander State Forest after Louisiana's first commissioner of conservation, M.L. Alexander.Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry, \\"Alexander State Forest and Indian Creek Lake\\" , Division of Administration, Administration Services In the following 15 years, Louisiana made nine more purchases, bringing the total acreage of Alexander State Forest to 7,995 acres.Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, \\"Alexander State Forest\\" Most of the land was barren when purchased. In 1933, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) started extensive planting of pine trees and continued to do so until 1940. This is a successful example of reforestation. During this time, the CCC also built the log administration building on the site. The forest today consists of about 700 acres of bottomland hardwood and 4,800 acres of southern yellow pine. Most of the tree species are loblolly pine, a type of southern yellow pine, as well as some slash and longleaf pine. Other tree species include red oaks, water oaks, willow oaks, blackgum, sweetgum, beech and hackberry. Indian Creek Recreation Area constitutes 2,250 acres of Alexander State Forest. Multiple uses Alexander State Forest is managed by the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry under the multiple use concept. Different uses include recreation, timber production, forest management research, wildlife habitats for threatened species and water and soil conservation.Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry, \\"Alexander Forest and Indian Creek Recreation Area\\" , Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry Recreation About 75 percent of the acreage in Alexander State Forest is used for recreation. This includes hunting, fishing, boating, swimming, picnics and camping at Indian Creek Recreation Area. The forest is known for its whitetail deer population for hunting, but other game species include quail, rabbit, squirrel and different waterfowl species. Fishing and camping are open year round. Timber production It is estimated that there are about 35 million board feet of timber. About 1.5 million board feet are harvested every year. This is an example of sustainable forest management of renewable resources. Using this method is an attempt to ensure that the pine forest habitat is not degraded by overexploitation. Forest management research A number of different studies have been conducted using data collected from Alexander State Forest. These studies range from the effects that different management methods have on the ecosystem to the effects different animal and insect species have on the pine trees. A 1994 study in Alexander State Forest by Robert B. Ferguson and V. Clark Baldwin Jr. examined the effects of spacing in slash pine trees that had not been thinned.Robert B. Ferguson and V. Clark Baldwin Jr., \\"Spacing effects on unthinned slash pine in the west gulf1,\\" Proceedings for the Eight Biennial Southern Silvicultural Research Conference, DIANE publishing. The trees were spaced from four feet apart to fourteen feet apart in order to study the best spacing distance for optimal growth. Ferguson and Baldwin showed that by the time the trees had aged fifteen years, there was a height difference of six feet between trees spaced four feet apart and the taller trees that were spaced ten feet apart. A 2005 graduate thesis by Jamie Schexnayder describes the effects of thinning on the yield of lumber for a plot of land in Alexander State Forest.Schexnayder, Jamie Camille, Growth of a Slash Pine Spacing Study Five Years After Thinning.\\" Diss. Louisiana State University, 2005. Schexnayder examined how far pine trees had to be spaced apart before thinning had any significant effect on tree growth. The results of these two studies relate to increasing board density in proper forest management. A 2004 graduate thesis by Keri E. Landry examined the effects of the red imported fire ant on the pine ecosystem at Alexander State Forest and the effects the insecticide Amdro had on the ecosystem. Landry, Keri E. Assessing landscape-level impacts of red imported fire ants on native faunal communities in pine-dominated forests. Diss. Faculty of the Louisiana State University, 2004. Amdro was effective in decreasing the population of red imported fire ants. In addition, the native ant population could better compete against the red imported fire ants in plots where Amdro was used. A 2006 graduate thesis by Lee A. Womack also assessed the effects of red imported fire ants on the pine ecosystem at Alexander State Forest, as well as the effects of Amdro on the ant population and the ecosystem in general. Womack, Lee A. IMPACTS OF RED IMPORTED FIRE ANTS (SOLENOPSIS IVICTA BUREN) ON NATIVE FAUNAL COMMUNITIES IN TWO PINE-DOMINATED FORESTS. Diss. Faculty of the Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, 2006. Womack's study suggested that the ants had little effect on the pine ecosystem and that, in concordance with Landry's thesis, Amdro was effective at controlling the ant population without harming other members of the ecosystem as well. A 2008 thesis by Laura M. Palasz studied how burning affected the Henslow's sparrow population and their habitat. Palasz, Laura M. Effects of burning on Henslow‚Äôs Sparrow (Ammodramus henslowii) density and habitat quality in Louisiana. Diss. University of Illinois, 2008. This study used Alexander State Forest as one of many sites. The paper suggested better ways to manage forests in order to increase Henslow's sparrow population density, such as conducting prescribed burns of the forest every two years instead of every year. Wildlife habitats for threatened species Alexander State Forest provides habitat for a number of different plant and animal species, some of which are threatened or near-threatened. The most often cited example is the red-cockaded woodpecker. This woodpecker is ranked as a G2 species globally and as an S2 species within the state of Louisiana.\\"Species of Conservation Concern in Louisiana\\". The United States Fish and Wildlife Service lists the red-cockaded woodpecker as endangered. The bird is listed on IUCN's Red List as vulnerable and is found in only 11 states today.U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \\"Red-cockaded Woodpecker Recovery\\", U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These states are Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Texas and Oklahoma. From 1993 to 2006, the United States saw an increase in clusters of red-cockaded woodpeckers from 4,694 active clusters to 6,105 active clusters. Other species in the forest include Henslow's sparrow and Bachman's sparrow. Both of these sparrows are near-threatened in the United States. Water and soil conservation The reservoir in the Indian Creek Recreation Area, in addition to recreation, is also used for irrigation of farmland during dry seasons, which saves drinking water from being used on crops.

Built in 1885, this two-story brick building was the town's first municipal structure, housing the town offices, jail, and fire station. In 1918 all functions except fire services moved out of the building. It now serves as Reading's Pleasant Street Senior Center. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history The former Reading Municipal Building is set on the southeast corner of Pleasant and Parker Streets, just off Reading's Main Street central business district. It is a rectangular two-story brick Renaissance Revival structure with a hip roof. Its northern facade is four bays wide, with the main entrance in the leftmost bay. The three first-floor windows are set in round-arch openings, while the four on the second are set in segmented-arch openings. The west facade originally housed the openings for the fire house, with three large round-arch openings now filled with wood paneling and windows below, and single segmented-arch windows flanking a central pair of narrow windows in the center bay. At the northeast corner, a wood frame tower with Stick style decoration rises to a gable-over-hip roof. The town of Reading was incorporated in 1644, but this, its first purpose- built municipal building, was not constructed until 1883. It was designed by local architect Horace G. Wadlin, and housed town offices, fire station, and the local jail. It served all of these roles until 1918, when the town offices were relocated to the present town hall in 1918. This building remained a fire station for many years, with its original round doorway openings combined into two rectangular openings to provide access for more modern fire equipment. The building was in this configuration when it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. The fire house facade has since been restored to its original form, albeit with the openings closed off, and the building now houses a local senior center.

The second- floor windows are set high, butting against the top plate in a typical Georgian fashion. The right side has a 20th-century bay window replacing one of the window bays. The house was built about 1748, and may incorporate portions of an even older building. It was built by Samuel Bancroft, a locally prominent civic leader, who purchased the property, then extending all the way to County Road, in 1748. The house was later owned by Ephraim Weston, a businessman who built another house nearby and turned this house over to his son. It is the oldest home located in Reading's West Street Historic District.

W. Hornung. He is the faithful companion of A. J. Raffles, a cricketer and gentleman thief, who makes a living robbing the rich in late Victorian British High Society. Bunny is the narrator in the original Raffles short stories and novel by Hornung, from the first short story \\"The Ides of March\\" (1898) to the novel and last story Mr. Justice Raffles (1909). Inspiration A. J. Raffles was to a certain extent an inverted version of Arthur Conan Doyle's character Sherlock Holmes, and Bunny, as the companion and biographer of Raffles, was similarly inspired by Dr. Watson.Rowland (1999), p. 131. The fact that Bunny contributed to his public school's magazine may have been inspired by Hornung's own experience, since Hornung's earliest literary work appeared in the magazine of his public school in 1882‚Äì3.Hornung (2003), \\"Notes\\" by Richard Lancelyn Green, p. 141. According to Richard Lancelyn Green, prototypes of Raffles and Bunny appeared in Hornung's short story \\"After the Fact\\", which was published in Chambers's Journal in January 1896. While the difference in age between Raffles and Bunny is not specified, the ages of these prototype characters are clearly stated in the story. In \\"After the Fact\\", set in Australia, the narrator finds a burglar in an empty house and recognizes him, since the narrator had been the burglar's fag at their old school (as Bunny had been for Raffles): \\"'We were at school together,' I explained. 'I was your fag when you were captain of footer.' 'The Beetle!' cried Deedes, not unkindly; a moment later he was shaking my hand and smiling on my confusion...We were twenty- eight and twenty-four now, instead of eighteen and fourteen; yet, as we walked, only one of us was a man, and I was once more his fag. I felt quite proud when he accepted a cigarette from my case, prouder yet when he took my arm.'\\"Hornung (2003), \\"Introduction\\" by Richard Lancelyn Green, pp. xx‚Äìxxi. Fictional biography History Bunny was an only child. He attended the same public school as Raffles. There was a considerable age gap between them and Bunny had been Raffles's fag (i.e. a younger pupil required to act as a personal servant to a senior one). Bunny had always admired the older, charming Raffles who was a top sportsman and seemed to prevail in anything he did. Bunny wrote verse for the school's magazine,Hornung, E. W. \\"The Chest of Silver\\", A Thief in the Night. 2098. and also did Raffles's verses for him. Raffles mentions in \\"The Ides of March\\" that Bunny edited the school magazine before leaving the school.Hornung, E. W. \\"The Ides of March\\", The Amateur Cracksman. 706. Ten years after they were at school together, during which time Bunny inherits a considerable amount of money, the two reunite at Raffles's apartment in the Albany to play baccarat with others. Bunny loses heavily during the course of the evening. However, he has spent his inheritance and is unable to pay his gambling debts. Feeling himself to be ruined and dishonoured, he returns later to confront Raffles and explain his situation, with the intention of then shooting himself. However, Raffles persuades him not to do this and offers to help. Admiring his pluck, Raffles tricks Bunny into joining him on a burglary, and the two become companions in crime. Together the two launch a series of daring robberies on London society, until they are eventually exposed in \\"The Gift of the Emperor\\" and arrested on board a passenger liner. Raffles leaps overboard and is presumed drowned, while Bunny is returned to England to serve a term of eighteen months in prison. After his release, he writes a series of articles on prison life. A mysterious newspaper advertisement reunites him with Raffles, who survived jumping off the liner and is now living under a false name. The two men continue their crime spree, now acting as outlaws. In 1900 both Raffles and Bunny volunteer for service in the Second Boer War where soldiers of the British Empire were fighting the Boer guerillas. After uncovering an enemy spy, Raffles is killed in battle and Bunny is badly wounded. He returns to England to write his memoirs about his escapades with Raffles. He chooses not to write about a number of their thefts which were successful but uneventful.Hornung, E. W. \\"The Last Laugh\\", Raffles: Further Adventures of the Amateur Cracksman (also titled The Black Mask). 707 Appearance Bunny is fair-haired and short enough to pass himself off as a tall woman in \\"The Rest Cure\\".Hornung, A Thief in the Night, chapter \\"The Rest Cure\\", page 81. Bunny has an innocent-looking appearance, and in the short story \\"An Old Flame\\", in which Bunny says he is thirty, he remarks that his appearance was not altered by his time in prison. Bunny writes, \\"Incredible as it may appear to the moralists, I had sustained no external hallmark by my term of imprisonment, and I am vain enough to believe that the evil which I did had not a separate existence in my face. This afternoon, indeed, I was struck by the purity of my fresh complexion, and rather depressed by the general innocence of the visage which peered into mine from the little mirror. My straw-colored moustache, grown in the flat after a protracted holiday, again preserved the most disappointing dimensions, and was still invisible in certain lights without wax.\\"Hornung, E. W. \\"An Old Flame\\", Raffles: Further Adventures of the Amateur Cracksman (also titled The Black Mask). 707 Bunny's innocent appearance is useful for deflecting suspicion from him and Raffles, but Bunny is not a skilled actor, so Raffles sometimes keeps secrets from him to make sure Bunny seems as guiltless as possible. An instance of this occurs in \\"No Sinecure\\", in which Raffles remarks that Bunny's face is \\"worth its weight in innocence\\".Hornung, E. W. \\"No Sinecure\\", Raffles: Further Adventures of the Amateur Cracksman (also titled The Black Mask). 707 Personality When Raffles tricks Bunny into joining him on a burglary in \\"The Ides of March\\", Bunny approaches the situation \\"with an involuntary zeal\\" and is entranced by the \\"romance and the peril of the whole proceeding\\". After learning Raffles is a burglar, Bunny expects that his liking and admiration for Raffles \\"must turn to loathing and disgust\\", yet to his own surprise, his regard for Raffles does not change. At the end of the story, Bunny initially has misgivings about becoming Raffles's partner in crime, but he ultimately agrees, telling Raffles, \\"I've gone to the devil anyhow. I can't go back, and wouldn't if I could. Nothing matters another rap! When you want me, I'm your man!\\". Whereas Raffles is sharp-witted and cynical, the younger Bunny is more innocent and idealistic. Raffles often uses Bunny's naivete and innocent manner to his and Bunny's advantage. Bunny dislikes Raffles's tendency to keep secrets about his plans from him, noting in \\"A Costume Piece\\" that Raffles has \\"the instinctive secretiveness of the inveterate criminal\\". Generally, Bunny gets along with Raffles. For example, in \\"Gentlemen and Players\\", Bunny states that it was a pleasure for him \\"to accompany Raffles to all his [cricket] matches, to watch every ball he bowled, or played, or fielded, and to sit chatting with him in the pavilion when he was doing none of these three things\\".Hornung, E. W. \\"Gentlemen and Players\\", The Amateur Cracksman. 706. Skills Though not an expert burglar like Raffles, Bunny is a dependable and loyal accomplice to Raffles and assists him in a number of ways, such as by providing a distraction in \\"Nine Points of the Law\\", acting as a lookout in \\"The Field of Philippi\\", and saving Raffles when his plans go awry in \\"The Wrong House\\". Bunny is a writer, and Raffles encourages Bunny to cultivate his career in journalism, to build a reputation as a cover for his secret occupation as a burglar. Bunny struggles as a journalist however, commenting, \\"It was no easy matter to keep your end up as a raw freelance of letters; for my part, I was afraid I wrote neither well enough nor ill enough for success.\\" He can write verse, and a satiric verse he wrote obtained a better place in a magazine than anything he had written before then, but he found that writing verses did not pay.Hornung, E. W. \\"The Gift of the Emperor\\", The Amateur Cracksman. 706. He eventually writes about his adventures with Raffles. As narrator Bunny Manders is the first-person narrator of all of E. W. Hornung's Raffles stories. Hornung's creation of Bunny was influenced by Arthur Conan Doyle's character Dr. Watson, the first-person narrator of most of the Sherlock Holmes stories, although there are significant differences between them. For instance, Watson starts his narrative in the first Sherlock Holmes story, A Study in Scarlet, by providing preliminary information about his career, his service in the second Afghan war, why he needed relatively cheap lodgings, and how he came to be introduced to Holmes. In contrast, Bunny's narrative in the first Raffles story, \\"The Ides of March\\", starts right at a crucial point when Bunny returns to the Albany in despair over his gambling debt.Rowland (1999), pp. 132‚Äì134. Like Watson, Bunny is frequently kept in the dark about his companion's plans. He also sometimes doubts Raffles's loyalty, but always realizes in the end that Raffles has worked events to their mutual advantage. Bunny thinks very highly of Raffles; he \\"relates Raffles‚Äô adventures in tones that range from adulatory to fawning\\", and can be considered \\"an early example of the ultimately unreliable narrator\\". While Bunny agrees to become Raffles's accomplice, he does worry about the ethics of their burglaries. William Vivian Butler writes that this eliminates any need for readers \\"to battle with [their] conscience: Bunny, the narrator of the stories, obligingly takes that chore clean off [their] shoulders\\". In addition, Bunny's concerns about the consequences that may befall him and Raffles contribute to the suspenseful atmosphere of the Raffles stories.

The toothcomb occurs in lemuriform primates (which includes lemurs and lorisoids), treeshrews, colugos, hyraxes, and some African antelopes. The structures evolved independently in different types of mammals through convergent evolution and vary both in dental composition and structure. In most mammals the comb is formed by a group of teeth with fine spaces between them. The toothcombs in most mammals include incisors only, while in lemuriform primates they include incisors and canine teeth that tilt forward at the front of the lower jaw, followed by a canine-shaped first premolar. The toothcombs of colugos and hyraxes take a different form with the individual incisors being serrated, providing multiple tines per tooth. The toothcomb is usually used for grooming. While licking the fur clean, the animal will run the toothcomb through the fur to comb it. Fine grooves or striations are usually cut into the teeth during grooming by the hair and may be seen on the sides of the teeth when viewed through a scanning electron microscope. The toothcomb is kept clean by either the tongue or, in the case of lemuriforms, the sublingua, a specialized \\"under-tongue\\". The toothcomb can have other functions, such as food procurement and bark gouging. Within lemuriforms, fork-marked lemurs and indriids have more robust toothcombs to support these secondary functions. In some lemurs, such as the aye-aye, the toothcomb has been lost completely and replaced with other specialized dentition. In lemuriform primates, the toothcomb has been used by scientists in the interpretation of the evolution of lemurs and their kin. They are thought to have evolved from early adapiform primates around the Eocene or earlier. One popular hypothesis is that they evolved from European adapids, but the fossil record suggests that they evolved from an older lineage that migrated to Africa during the Paleocene (66 to 55 mya) and might have evolved from early cercamoniines from Asia. Fossil primates such as Djebelemur, 'Anchomomys' milleri, and Plesiopithecus may have been their closest relatives. The lack of a distinct toothcomb in the fossil record before to 40 mya has created a conflict with molecular clock studies that suggest an older divergence between lemurs and lorisoids, and the existence of a ghost lineage of lemuriform primates in Africa.  Homologous and analogous structures  The toothcomb of a colugo differs significantly in shape from that of lemuriform primates. The toothcomb, a special morphological arrangement of teeth in the anterior lower jaw, is best known in extant strepsirrhine primates, which include lemurs and lorisoid primates (collectively known as lemuriforms). This homologous structure is a diagnostic character that helps define this clade (related group) of primates. An analogous trait is found in the bald uakari (Cacajao calvus), a type of New World monkey. Toothcombs can also be found in colugos and treeshrews, both close relatives of primates; however, the structures are different and these are considered to examples of convergent evolution. Likewise, small- or medium-sized African antelopes, such as the impala (Aepyceros melampus), have a similar structure sometimes referred to as the \\"lateral dental grooming apparatus\\". Living and extinct hyraxes (hyracoids) also exhibit a toothcomb, although the number of tines in the comb vary throughout the fossil record. Dating to the Eocene epoch over 50 mya, Chriacus and Thryptacodon‚Äîtwo types of arctocyonids (primitive placental mammals)‚Äîalso possessed an independently evolved toothcomb.  Anatomical structure  The toothcomb of most lemuriforms includes six finely spaced teeth, four incisors and two canine teeth that are procumbent (tilt forward) in the front of the mouth. The procumbent lower canine teeth are the same shape as the incisors located between them, but they are more robust and curve upward and inward, more so than the incisors. In the permanent dentition, the canines erupt after the incisors. The crowns of the incisors are also angled in the direction of the forward tilt, and the crowns of both the incisors and canines are elongated and compressed side-to-side. The apical ridge, following along the front edges of the toothcomb teeth, is V-shaped in most lemuriforms, tapering off from the midline. As a result of this dental reconfiguration, the upper and lower incisors do not contact one another, and often the upper incisors are reduced or lost completely. Toothcomb of a ring-tailed lemur, with canine-like premolars behind it The French anatomist Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville first identified the two lateral teeth of the lemuriform toothcomb as canines in 1840. Canine teeth are normally used to pierce or grasp objects. With modified lower canine teeth, the first lower premolars following the toothcomb are usually shaped like typical canine teeth (caniniform) and assume their function. These premolars are commonly confused with canines. Normally the true canines in the lower jaw sit in front of the upper canines, and in toothcombed primates, the caniniform premolars rest behind it. The lemuriform toothcomb is kept clean by the sublingua or \\"under- tongue\\", a specialized muscular structure that acts like a toothbrush to remove hair and other debris. The sublingua can extend below the end of the tongue and is tipped with keratinized, serrated points that rake between the front teeth. Among lemurs, the toothcomb is variable in structure. Among indriids (Indriidae), the toothcomb is less procumbent and consists of four teeth instead of six. The indriid toothcomb is more robust and wider, with shorter incisors, wider spaces between the teeth (interdental spaces), and a broader apical ridge. It is unclear whether this four-toothed toothcomb consists of two pairs of incisors or one pair of incisors and one pair of canines. In fork-marked lemurs (Phaner) the toothcomb is more compressed, with significantly reduced interdental spaces. All six teeth are longer, straighter, and form a more continuous apical ridge. In the recently extinct monkey lemurs (Archaeolemuridae) and sloth lemurs (Palaeopropithecidae), the toothcomb was lost and the incisors and canines resumed a typical configuration in the front of the mouth. The aye-aye also lost its toothcomb, replacing it with continually growing (hypselodont) front teeth, similar to the incisors of rodents. In colugos, the toothcomb has a completely different structure. Instead of individual incisors and canine teeth being finely spaced to act like the teeth of a comb, the biting edge of the four incisors have become serrated with as many as 15 tines each, while the canine acts more like a molar. These serrated incisors are kept clean using the front of the tongue, which is serrated to match the serrations of the incisors. Similarly, the hyracoid toothcomb consists of incisors with multiple tines, called \\"pectinations\\". In contrast to the colugos, the size and shape of the tines are more uniform. The toothcomb of treeshrews is like the lemuriform toothcomb in that it uses interdental spaces to form the comb tines, but only two of its three pairs of lower incisors are included in the toothcomb and the canines are also excluded. The lateral two incisors in the toothcomb are generally larger. In the extinct arctocyonids, all six lower incisors were part of the toothcomb. In African antelopes, the toothcomb is strikingly similar to that of lemuriforms in that it consists of two pairs of incisors and a pair of canines.  Functions  As a homologous structure in lemuriforms, the toothcomb serves variable biological roles, despite its superficially stereotypic shape and appearance. It is primarily used as a toiletry device or grooming comb. Additionally, some species use their toothcomb for food procurement or to gouge tree bark.  Grooming  alt=A close-up of a slow loris licking its nose and the sublingua sticking out beneath it The primary function of the toothcomb, grooming, was first noted by the French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1829, who pointed out that the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) had lower incisors that \\"sont de v√©ritables peignes\\" (\\"are real combs\\"). More than 100 years later, the grooming function was questioned since it was difficult to observe and the interdental spaces were thought to be too small for fur. Observations later showed the teeth were used for that purpose and that immediately after grooming, hair may be found trapped in the teeth, but is removed by the sublingua later. In 1981, scanning electron microscopy revealed fine grooves or striations on the teeth in lemuriform toothcombs. These grooves were only found on the sides of the teeth on the concave surfaces between the sides, as well on the back ridge of the teeth. Between 10 and 20 ¬µm wide, these grooves indicate that hair moved repeatedly across the teeth. Inside these grooves were even finer grooves, less than 1 ¬µm, created by abrasion with the cuticular layer of the hair. Among non-primates, the extinct Chriacus exhibits microscopic groves on its toothcomb, but the Philippine colugo (Cynocephalus volans) does not. The toothcomb of the colugos is generally considered to function as a toothcomb, but due to the lack of striations on the teeth and no documented observations of toothcomb use during oral grooming, its use seems to be limited to food procurement. In African antelopes, the lateral dental grooming apparatus does not appear to be used during grazing or browsing. Instead, it is used during grooming when the head sweeps upward in a distinctive motion. It is thought to comb the fur and remove ectoparasites.  Olfaction in lemuriforms  In lemuriform primates, the toothcomb may also play a secondary role in olfaction, which may account for the size reduction of the poorly studied upper incisors. The toothcomb may provide pressure to stimulate glandular secretions which are then spread through the fur. Furthermore, the size reduction of the upper incisors may create a gap between the teeth (interincisal diastema) that connects the philtrum (a cleft in the middle of the wet nose, or rhinarium) to the vomeronasal organ in the roof of the mouth. This would allow pheromones to be more easily transferred to the vomeronasal organ.  Food procurement and other uses  Mouse lemurs (Microcebus), sifakas (Propithecus), and the indri (Indri) use their toothcombs to scoop up fruit pulp. Other small lemuriforms, such as fork-marked lemurs (Phaner), the hairy-eared dwarf lemur (Allocebus), and galagos (particularly the genera Galago and Euoticus) use their toothcombs to tooth-scrape plant exudates, such as gum and sap. In fork-marked lemurs, the toothcomb is specially adapted to minimize food trapment since the interdental spaces are greatly reduced. The herbivorous colugos in the genus Cynocephalus may also use their toothcomb for food procurement. Indriids such as the sifakas use their toothcombs to gouge bark or dead wood (bark-prising), which is done before scent-marking with the gland on their chest. The more robust structure of their toothcomb is thought to help it withstand the compressive forces experienced during regular bark-prising.  Evolution in lemuriforms  The origins of the lemuriform toothcomb and the clade it characterizes have been the center of considerable debate for more than a century. In 1920, British palaeoanthropologist Wilfrid Le Gros Clark proposed that the toothcomb found in treeshrews (which he believed were primates) was an early version of the dental structure found in lemuriforms. Because he viewed the fossil lorisoids from the Miocene as not having fully developed the modern lemuriform toothcomb, he implied that lemurs and lorisoids had evolved the trait independently. This view was later overturned, and the monophyletic relationship between lemurs and lorisoids is now accepted. The ancestral condition of the anterior dentition on the lower jaw, based on Eocene primate fossils, suggests that earliest primates had lacked a differentiated toothcomb. Most fossil strepsirrhines lacked the stereotypic lemuriform toothcomb. Collectively, early strepsirrhine primates are known as adapiforms. Adapiforms are considered to be a paraphyletic group (containing many but not all of the descendants of the last common ancestor of the group's members) because the lemuriforms are assumed to have evolved from one of several groups of adapiforms. In terms of ecology, the evolution of the toothcomb is assumed to have required a folivorous (leaf-eating) diet among the ancestral adapiform population, since that would select for reduced incisors, which would serve as an exaptation (a trait with adaptive value for something other than what it was originally selected for), which could then be used for personal or social grooming. However, the inclusion of the canines into the toothcomb must have required exceptional conditions, since large lemuriforms have secondarily modified caniniform premolars to substitute for the loss. A popular hypothesis about the origins of the lemuriform clade is that they evolved from European adapiforms known as adapids. In some adapids, the crests of the lower incisors and canines align to form functional cropping unit, and the American paleontologist Philip D. Gingerich has suggested this foreshadowed the development of the lemuriform toothcomb. However, no lemuriform toothcomb has been found in the fossil record of the Eocene, and the European adapid lower jaws from that time did not resemble the derived state seen in lemuriforms. Lemuriforms are currently thought to have evolved in Africa, and the earliest known strepsirrhine primates from Africa are azibiids from the early Eocene, which likely descended from a very early colonization of the Afro-Arabian land mass in the Paleocene (66 to 55 mya). Stem lemuriforms, including Djebelemur and 'Anchomomys' milleri, have been found in Africa and date from 50 to 48 mya and were very distinct from European adapiforms. However, they lack a toothcomb. These stem lemuriforms suggest an early common ancestry with cercamoniines from outside of Europe. Based on large, procumbent lower teeth, Plesiopithecus, a fossil primate found in late Eocene deposits at the Fayum Depression in Egypt, is thought to be most closely related to lemuriforms. Together, Djebelemur, ‚ÄòAnchomomys‚Äô milleri, and Plesiopithecus are considered to be sister taxa (the closest relatives) of lemuriform primates.  Dating inconsistencies  Although stem lemuriforms like Djebelemur may have been contemporaneous with related toothcombed primates around 50 to 48 mya, the sparse African fossil record suggests toothcomb differentiation occurred around 52 to 40 mya according to the French paleoanthropologist Marc Godinot. This would conflict with the molecular clock estimates by evolutionary anthropologist Anne Yoder and others, which predict lemur‚Äìlorisoid divergence dating between 61 and 90.8 mya. In 2001, the discovery of Bugtilemur, a fossil primate from Pakistan dating to the Oligocene and initially thought to be a cheirogaleid lemur, further challenged the theory of lemur origins; however, it was later shown to be a type of adapiform primate and not a lemur. The minimum paleontological estimate for the divergence of lemurs and lorisoids nearly doubled when additional discoveries were made in northern Egypt during the 2000s of a stem galagid (Saharagalago) and a stem or crown lorisoid (Karanisia) dating to 37 and 40 mya respectively. Karanisia is the oldest fossil primate to exhibit a distinct lemuriform toothcomb. This, as well as studies of other African adapiforms like ‚ÄòAnchomomys‚Äô milleri, suggests a more ancient ghost lineage for lemuriforms in Africa.  Original function of the lemuriform toothcomb  The selective pressure that shaped the original lemuriform toothcomb has been a topic of considerable debate since the 1970s. Evidence can be seen as supporting a grooming function, food procurement function, or both. In the early 1900s, there was less debate. Grooming was seen as the primary function since primates lack the claws needed to adequately comb the fur, although prosimian primates (strepsirrhines and tarsiers) possess at least one grooming claw on each foot to compensate. Grooming‚Äîin the form of fur-combing‚Äîis generally considered the primary function and original role of the lemuriform toothcomb, and subsequent changes in morphology across multiple lineages have altered its function and obscured its original function. The hypothesis that the toothcomb evolved for food procurement was based on observations of recent lemuriform taxa, such as cheirogaleid lemurs (particularly fork-marked lemurs and the hairy-eared dwarf lemur) and galagos, which demonstrate tooth-scraping of plant exudates, as well as sifakas, which practice bark-prising. Each of these were considered \\"primitive\\" forms among the living strepsirrhines, suggesting the first lemuriforms exhibited similar behaviors. Also, strong selective pressure from feeding ecology placed on the anterior dentition was emphasized, based on the specialized upper anterior dentition seen in the recently extinct koala lemurs (Megaladapis). If feeding ecology could have such profound effects on the shape of the anterior dentition, then convergent evolution might explain the similarities seen between the compressed lower incisors of the lemuriform toothcomb and the exudate feeding adaptations in the genus Callithrix (a type of marmoset). In contrast, the grooming hypothesis emphasized that all lemuriforms use their toothcombs for grooming, and long, thin teeth are poorly suited for the mechanical stress of gouging and exudate feeding. Also the interdental spaces seen in most lemuriforms favor fur combing and would also promote bacterial growth and tooth decay if used for exudate feeding. Supporting this, reduced interdental spacing is found in exudate feeding lemuriforms. Furthermore, the canine included in the toothcomb provides additional interdental spacing for fur combing. Even the behavior of young lemuriforms suggests that grooming plays a more important role in the use of the toothcomb than food procurement.

Biography Family life Trip was the son of Jonkheer Jan Louis Trip van Zoudtlandt and Anna Wilhelmina, countess of Limburg-Stirum. He first married Cornelia Gijsberta Smit, and after her death, Elisabeth Gratiana, countess of Limburg-Stirum (a cousin) at The Hague on August 16, 1826. Career Trip entered the service of the Dutch Republic on July 1, 1791, as a cadet in an infantry regiment. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1792, and promoted to first lieutenant on July 8, 1795. By then the Batavian Republic had replaced the Dutch Republic. As an officer in the Batavian army, and subsequently the army of the Kingdom of Holland he saw action in its campaigns as an ally of the imperial French army in Germany and (then Swedish) Pomerania. During this career he switched to the cavalry and became commander of a regiment of cuirassiers. When the Kingdom of Holland was annexed by the First French Empire in July, 1810, all Dutch army units were incorporated in the French army under new names. Trip's regiment became the 14th Regiment Cuirassiers. With this regiment Trip took part in the French invasion of Russia in 1812. His regiment distinguished itself (like other Dutch regiments) at the Battle of Berezina, during the harrowing retreat of the French army from Moscow. Trip subsequently took part in the final campaigns of the French army before Napoleon I of France's first abdication in 1814. He distinguished himself again at the Battle of Leipzig. After the fall of the Empire the Dutch contingents in the French army were demobilized. Trip left French service as a colonel on April 14, 1814. He entered the service of the new Dutch army (the Netherlands having regained its independence at the end of 1813) in June, 1814 with the same rank, and became aide de camp of the Sovereign Prince, William I of the Netherlands. He was promoted to major- general on April 16, 1815, and given the command of a brigade of heavy cavalry, composed of the 1st and 3rd (Dutch) and 2nd (Belgian) regiments of (mounted) carabiniers of the new Netherlands Mobile Army of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. Battles of Quatre Bras and Waterloo This brigade took part in the Battle of Quatre Bras and the subsequent Battle of Waterloo as part of the Netherlands Cavalry Division (lt.-gen. J.A. Baron de Collaert) of the First Netherlands Corps under the Prince of Orange. This Corps formed the center of the Duke of Wellington's Anglo-Allied army at Waterloo. Trip's brigade was initially placed astride the Nivelles road, but when Trip noticed the French preparations for Marshal Ney's great cavalry attack after d'Erlon's failed assault on the Allied left wing, he repositioned his brigade to counter that attack to a position south-west of Mont St.-Jean. When Ney attacked the British artillery Trip's brigade joined Lord Edward Somerset's Household Brigade in its counterattack. Both the French cuirassiers and the Dutch/Belgian carabiniers charged. The French horses (already tired from their previous exertions) could not make sufficient speed, due to the heavy ground they had to traverse, and Trip's carabiniers shattered their formation through the sheer impact of their assault. This caused a rout of the left wing of the French cuirassiers, which was exploited by other allied cavalry units. During this encounter Trips's brigade suffered severe casualties.Cavaleriegeschiedenis, op. cit.; see for the losses of the brigade Order of battle of the Waterloo Campaign Despite these casualties, the brigade soon had to renew its attacks. The 2nd (Belgian) Regiment was led by the Prince of Orange personally in a charge, where he encouraged them with the cry: 'Allons, mes camarades, sabrons ces Francais, la victoire est √† nous'Cavaleriegeschiedenis, op. cit. (Come on, comrades, let's put our sabres to these Frenchmen, the victory is ours). The brigade again routed the opposing cavalry and pursued them past the road to Ohain. During these exploits the commanders of both the 1st (lt.-col. Coenegracht) and 3rd (lt.-col. Lechleitner) regiments were mortally wounded. Nevertheless, the brigade took part in the pursuit of the French army after the failed attack of Napoleon's Guard divisions finally caused its defeat, until Wellington called off the pursuit around 10 pm.See \\"Relation des √©v√©nements qui se sont pass√©s a la brigade de grosse cavalerie durant la bataille du 18 juin 1815 et jusqu'au 19 et au 20 juin 1815, par le g√©n√©ral A.D.

Trip himself was made a knight-commander in the Military William Order on July 8, 1815. The Siborne controversy In 1844, almost thirty years after the battle, a British military historian, William Siborne, published a book based on a survey he had made of a number of British officers, who had attended the Battle of Waterloo. In this book Siborne accused Trip personally, and the brigade as a whole, of refusing to advance when ordered, on the basis of allegations made by Lord Uxbridge, the British cavalry commander at Waterloo, and Captain Horace Seymour. According to this account, Uxbridge had tried to order the brigade forward in a charge at the time Somerset made his charge. According to Uxbridge and Seymour, Trip had refused this order, even though Uxbridge had given him a severe reprimand (presumably in English). After Uxbridge had disgustedly ridden away (still to the testimony of the British eyewitnesses) the whole brigade had retired, even disturbing the preparations of other allied cavalry units. History of the War in France and Belgium, in 1815. Containing Minute Details of the Battles of Quatre-Bras, Ligny, Wavre, and Waterloo, Adamant Media Corporation, , , pp. 296‚Äì297 Uxbridge stated in his account that ‚ÄúI have the strongest reason to be excessively dissatisfied with the General commanding a Brigade of Dutch Heavy Cavalry, and with a Colonel commanding a young Regiment of Hanoverian Hussars.‚Äù Siborne Waterloo letters, p.12, https://archive.org/details/waterlooletterss00sibo Captain Horace Seymour also stated ‚Äúas to the conduct of the Dutch Brigade of Heavy Cavalry, the impression still on my mind is that they did show a lamentable want of spirit,‚Äù.Siborne Waterloo letters, p.18). This account is at variance with the above account of the battle, which is based on Dutch after-battle reports. Siborne has two eye-witness accounts. These allegations caused a furore in the Netherlands and Belgium. Dutch general Willem Jan Knoop soon published a semi-official refutation as did his Belgian colleague general Alexis-Michel Eenens. The latter is especially scathing in his destruction of Siborne's argument pertaining to the Trip brigade, probably because the honor of the 2nd (Belgian) regiment of carabiniers was directly insulted.

He was appointed commander-in-chief of Dutch cavalry on March 22, 1831. During the Ten days campaign in the course of the Belgian Revolution of 1830 he was wounded during the attack on Leuven on August 12, 1831. Shortly afterward, he received the Grand-Cross in the Order of the Netherlands Lion. Trip died, still in office, on March 23, 1835, in The Hague.

It runs along the town's main commercial district, Massachusetts Avenue, from Jason Street to Franklin Street, and includes adjacent 19th- and early 20th-century residential areas roughly bounded by Jason Street, Pleasant Street, and Gray Street. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The oldest house in the district is the c. 1740 Jason Russell House. The town's Old Burying Ground is located on Pleasant Street; its oldest marked grave dates to 1735. Arlington was the scene of some of the worst fighting in the Battles of Lexington and Concord that started the American Revolutionary War in 1775. A number of the dead from both sides of that battle are interred there. Arlington remained a small rural town until the middle of the 19th century. Before then it had a few mills (none of which have survived) located on Mill Brook, which runs just north of Massachusetts Avenue. Some of the housing associated with the mill workers survives in a densely packed residential area on Central Street. One of the finer houses from this period is the 1842 Gothic Revival Chase Wellington House at 16 Maple Street. Most of the commercial, civic, and religious buildings in Arlington Center were built later in the 19th century or in the early years of the 20th. Prominent among them is the Classical Revival Robbins Memorial Town Hall, designed by R. Clipston Sturgis and built in 1912, and the adjacent Robbins Memorial Library, built in 1892 to a design by Cabot, Everett & Mead. In between them are gardens that were first designed by Sturgis and later redesigned in 1939 by the Olmsted Brothers firm. Unusual is the octagonal Central Fire Station, which anchors the east end of the district, built in 1926 to a design by George Ernest Robinson.

Description and history The Arlington Coal & Lumber Company building is located on the north side of Park Avenue on the east side of the village of Arlington Heights. It is a two-story wood frame building with a front gabled roof. Its exterior is clad mostly in wooden clapboards, with top portion of the front gable finished in vertical board siding. The front facade has four sash windows on the first floor, with the entrance between the two rightmost, framed by pilasters and topped by an entablature and gabled pediment. The first floor is separated from the second by a shallow hip-roofed porch. The upper level has a central group of three tall round-arch windows, flanked on either side small round windows. Fenestration and door placement on the sides is varied. The ground floor houses commercial space, and the upper level a large auditorium. The distinctive Gothic Revival building was built c. 1875, and has seen a variety of uses. Its upper floor was used as a meeting space, and was where political meetings, religious services, and social events took place, along with civic activities such as theater productions, dance classes, and fraternal society meetings. One group that used it was the Arlington Zouaves, a quasi-military marching society. The first floor has predominantly been used for commercial purposes, although the building did for a time house a branch of the local public library.

Early years Huismann was born in Littleton, Colorado, and attended Colorado State University upon graduation from Thomas B. Doherty High School in Colorado Springs. Shortly after his 21st birthday, he was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the 23rd round of the 1979 Major League Baseball Draft, but did not sign. After going undrafted in the 1980 Major League Baseball Draft, he signed with the Kansas City Royals as an amateur free agent. Kansas City Royals After four seasons in the minors, in which he compiled a 20‚Äì15 record with 49 saves and a 2.29 earned run average, Huismann made his major league debut on August 16, 1983 against the Detroit Tigers. Huismann drove his parents' car to the game, and almost didn't make it, as the car overheated three times on the way to Royals Stadium. He made it in time to enter the game in the fifth inning, and with runners on first and third and two outs, Huismann induced a fly ball to center from cleanup hitter Lance Parrish to end the threat. The Royals erupted for nine runs in the seventh to make a winner of Huismann in his debut. Huismann began the season with the Royals, but after going 0‚Äì2 with a 6.75 ERA in thirteen appearances, he was optioned back to triple A Omaha. He was far more effective when he returned in July, going 3‚Äì1 with a 2.79 ERA and three saves over the rest of the season. He made his only post season appearance in game one of the 1984 American League Championship Series against the Detroit Tigers. Despite this progress, he did not make the Royals' roster for 1985. Instead, he compiled an American Association record 33 saves for the Omaha Royals to earn Pitcher of the Year honors. He received a call-up to the majors when rosters expanded that September, and was 1‚Äì0 with a 1.93 ERA in nine games, but was not part of the Royals' post season roster. Seattle Mariners With Dan Quisenberry in his prime, there was little room for a closer on the Royals. On May 21, 1986, he was traded to the Seattle Mariners for catcher Terry Bell. He made his only career start for the M's on July 21 against the Toronto Blue Jays. He was pulled in the fourth inning after having surrendered six runs (5 earned), and took the loss. Otherwise, he spent the rest of the season in a lefty/righty platoon with Matt Young closing games for Seattle. Huismann finished fourteen games, picking up four saves. Cleveland Indians He appeared in just six games for the Mariners in before being dealt to the Cleveland Indians for outfielder Dave Gallagher. He was 2‚Äì3 with two saves and a 5.09 ERA for the Indians when he was optioned down to the triple A Buffalo Bisons on July 15. The Indians released Huismann during Spring training the following season. Shortly afterwards, he signed with the Detroit Tigers. Huismann pitched in all or part of nine seasons in the majors for six different teams from 1983 until 1991. Despite spending parts of nine seasons in the major leagues, Huismann pitched in more than 20 games in the majors just three times, spending more time at the minor league level than the majors in nearly every season (1986 being the only season during that stretch that he did not spend any time in the minors). In 1992 he played his final season of baseball for the Omaha Royals.

Description and history The former Arlington Gas Company property consists of about on the east side of Grove Street in central Arlington, and is bounded on the north by the former railroad right-of-way that now carries the Minuteman Bike Path. The largest surviving building, a power station occupying a significant portion of the back section of the property, is a prominent local example of Romanesque Revival architecture, with corbelled brick decoration on its cornices. Fronting on Grove Street are two smaller brick buildings, one originally serving as the gas company offices, and the other as a meter house. The site's previous industrial use was for the Welch and Griffith saw factory, the first in the United States. This complex burned down in 1913. The complex was built in 1914 to house the Arlington Gas Company, which manufactured fuel for home use. It originally included a large storage tank, on top of which was emblazoned \\"ARLINGTON\\" and an arrow pointing north; this was one of the earliest known aids to aerial navigation, and was torn down in 1975.

It is a 3-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, two interior chimneys, and a clapboarded exterior. It is five bays wide and four deep, with a symmetrical front facade. At the center of the facade is a double entrance sheltered by a porch supported by square posts. Windows are sash on the first two floors, with smaller windows on the third floor. Arlington's Baptist Society was organized in 1780, and was the first group to split away from the town's dominant Congregational church. The congregation first met in a number of private places, including the Capt. Benjamin Locke House, until this building was constructed in 1790. The congregation is now housed in Arlington's First Baptist Church, and sold this building into private ownership in 1828. The architecture of this building is in emulation of older meeting houses in Lexington and Concord, dating to the early decades of the 18th century, which are seen in period engravings depicting the Battles of Lexington and Concord which started the American Revolutionary War.

Built in 1919-23, the building is a near replica of Boston's Kings Chapel, executed in wood. Its tower is topped by a belfry designed by architect Charles Bulfinch in 1809 and built for use on Boylston Market; it was rescued from demolition and given to the church in 1921. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Calvary Methodist Church is located on the southwest side of Massachusetts Avenue, southeast of Arlington center. It is a rectangular wood frame structure, with a projecting vestibule and tower. The main block has a hipped roof, and its side walls have four round-arch windows. The projecting is fronted by four Ionic columns, with a square stage above that houses a clock with a single face facing front, and small round windows on the other three sides. This stage is topped by a balustrade, and a flush-boarded stage with wide projecting sections and a dentillated cornice. Above this is an octagonal belfry, with four wide sides housing round-arched louvered openings with engaged columns at the corners. A stepped-back octagonal section tops the belfry, with a concave roof at the very top. A parish house, built in 1953, is attached to the church by a narrow passage. The Methodist congregation first met in Arlington in 1916, and a plan for construction of a church for it soon followed. The present building was designed by James Macnaughton and William Perry, and construction began in 1919. The congregation had difficulty keeping up with the construction costs, and the builder threatened to sell off the partially-finished building for use as a theater. A town-wide appeal raised sufficient funds to cover the costs, and the building was completed in 1923. During the design process, Macnaughton had learned of Charles Bulfinch's planned cupola for Boston's Kings Chapel, which was never executed. He learned of the existence of a Bulfinch-designed cupola that had been installed on the Boylston Market, a Bulfinch design built in 1810 and torn down in 1887. The cupola had been removed in 1886 and purchased by a brewery in Charlestown, which was itself slated for demolition after closing due to Prohibition. The owner agreed to donate the cupola to the church, on condition that its origin be properly credited.

The scalation includes 23 rows of dorsal scales at midbody, 188-196 ventral scales and 53-66 mostly paired subcaudal scales. On the head there are usually 6-8 intersupraoculars, 7-8 supralabial scales (the second is fused with the prelacunal to form a lacunolabial) and 9-11 sublabial scales. The color pattern consists of a brownish green to green to grayish green ground color overlaid with a series of pairs of crossbars. These crossbars are dark brown or black and bordered with yellow or yellowish white. This pattern usually breaks up anteriorly, resulting in spots of both colors. Occasionally, a row of yellowish ventrolateral spots, each covering 1-3 scales, is present and extends to the tail. The belly is yellow with pale green mottling. On the head, a well-defined postocular script is present that extends to the angle of the mouth, but does not involve the supralabial scales.

Founded in 1999, it occupies the former Saint Athanasius Greek Orthodox Church at 735 Massachusetts Avenue in the town center. The building, constructed in 1841 and restyled in 1860, is a prominent regional example of Italianate ecclesiastical architecture, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Building architecture and history Highrock Church stands on the west side of Arlington Center, on the north side of Massachusetts Avenue between Central Street and Mill Street. It is a basically rectangular single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. It is fronted by a projecting vestibule with elaborate Classical features, capped by an equally elaborate three-stage tower topped by a blue cupola. The interior is more modestly styled. The church building was constructed in 1841 for a Universalist congregation that had broken off from First Parish Congregational Church, which maintained a Unitarian belief. It was originally trimmed with Greek Revival features, and lacked the projecting entry and tower. In 1860 it was substantially altered according to plans developed by ecclesiastical architect Thomas Silloway, which included the elaborate front and a tower with a spire. The spire was blown away in the Great New England Hurricane of 1938, and was replaced by the cupola. The church's architecture is regarded as one of the finest examples of early Italianate ecclesiastical architecture in the Greater Boston area. In 1961, the two congregations reunited, occupying a building across the street. In 1964, Saint Athasius Greek Orthodox Church purchased the building from the Universalists and made the site its home until 2004. The church building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. In 2006, the Highrock congregation purchased the building, after the Greek Orthodox congregation moved to a larger structure (the former St. James Roman Catholic Church in Arlington). Congregation history The Highrock congregation was established in 1999 in Needham, Massachusetts, adopting the name \\"Highrock\\" from the street on which they met. The joined the Evangelical Covenant Church in 2003, and in 2006 purchased this building.http://www.highrock.org/about/church-plants/ (accessed November 6, 2012) In 2008, Highrock launched its first church plant, establishing a new congregation in Brookline.

History  Prior to December 31, 1972, Ardath was a village, but it was restructured as an unincorporated community on that date. Ardath took its name from the British novel Ardath: The Story of a Dead Self by Marie Corelli . Both the Ardath United Church and the town hall were built in 1912. Ardath's decline began after a series of bizarre events, starting in 1919 when a train crashed through one of the village's grain elevators killing three people. \\"But at 10:15 a.m. on March 24, 1919 things began to go horribly wrong at Ardath. A southbound passenger train took to the switch track at high speed and slammed through the first of four grain elevators at Ardath. The elevator agent had just left the office, and was at the station to put his mail on the train. All that remained of his office was his chair.When the train came to a crashing halt it was buried in grain.Three people were killed in the accident; the locomotive fireman, the engineer, and a passenger.\\" A few years later, a fire destroyed most of main street resulting in a large scale exodus from the community of many of the community's 150 residents. In 1931, a man murdered another man believing him to be someone else and then burned down a house, the culminating event that contributed to Ardath's eventual decline.

It was built in 1925 by the Locatelli family, and is one of the area's finest early motion picture theaters. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description The Capitol Theater building is a large three-story brick and masonry structure at the northwest corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Lake Street in eastern Arlington. The building is stylistically diverse, featuring elements found in the Classical Revival, Baroque, and early Art Deco styles. The entrance to the theater is found on the long facade facing Massachusetts Avenue, flanked by several commercial storefronts. There is a storefront with an angled entrance at the corner with Lake Street, and another on Lake Street that now provides access to part of the theater lobby. In the late 2000s, the businesses along the stretch of Massachusetts Avenue surrounding the building organized as the Capitol Square Business Association. Theater history The theater was designed by William J. Drummey, and built in 1925 as part of the Albert Locatelli chain of theaters. The Locatellis also built other area theaters like the Ball Square Theater and Central Theater, both in Somerville. The building cost $500,000 to build, and originally housed 11 stores, office space on the second floor, and 15 apartments on the third. The theater originally had a large pipe organ and seating for 1600 people among an orchestra area and balcony for viewing a stage where, in addition to films, vaudeville acts could be seen. The theater changed owners several times between the early 1930s and 1990 and was multiplexed in 1989. During the 1960s the theater was remodeled to a more contemporary design but the original details including granite columns and gold leaf detail were simply covered over rather than demolished.

Built in 1915, it is the town's only work of the architect Ralph Adams Cram, and is a fine example of Norman Gothic architecture. The chapel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The chapel is set on the east side of Claremont Avenue in a residential part of Arlington Heights, on the grounds of the Youth Villages-Germaine Lawrence Campus. This property was, at the time of the chapel's construction in 1915, part of an Episcopalian orphanage. Ralph Adams Cram designed the chapel, although it is done in Norman style rather than Cram's more well-known Gothic Victorian. Its stained-glass windows are by a frequent Cram collaborator, Charles Connick. The chapel is a two-story roughly rectangular stone structure, oriented east-west, with a gabled roof. The stone used in its construction was locally gathered, and integrates a number of unusual features, including a paving stone from the Cambridge sewer system, a 16th-century madonna and child figure executed in Carrara marble, and ecclesiastical wood carvings. It has a gracefully curved apse, and a rose window in the gable at the western end. The Society of St. John established an orphanage on this property in 1910, and initially held its religious services in a small wood-frame chapel. The present chapel was built to replace that structure. In 1928 the property was repurposed to become the St. Anne's School for Girls, named for the order of nuns who ran the facility. In 1978 the nuns began to separate the religious aspect from the school, which had come to serve predominantly emotionally troubled children. This resulted in the creation in 1980 of the Germaine Lawrence School, since merged with the Youth Villages organization.

Built in the mid-1880s and moved to its present location in 1896, it is a well-preserved but fully realized example of Queen Anne architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The Cushman House stands in a residential neighborhood on the south side of Arlington Center, on the east side of Bartlett Avenue midway between Gray and Woodland Streets. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a cross-gabled roof and an exterior of wooden clapboards and shingles. It is roughly T-shaped, with its entry porch located in the crook of the T, with turned posts and brackets forming arches supporting the porch roof. The siding at the upper levels is partly standard wooden shingles, and partly scallop-cut rows, giving variety to the surface. (Note that the inventory record post-dates the NRHP nomination, correcting information in the latter.) The house was built in 1884-1885 as a rental property by Thomas and John Gray, on the former Fowle estate, and was originally located facing Jason Street. The house was purchased and moved in 1896 by Mr. and Mrs Gardner Cushman, who built their Colonial Revival mansion (72 Irving Street) partly on that land. In 1897, Fannie Cushman sold this house to George and Annie Wentworth, who lived there some twenty years. It is one of Arlington's best-preserved examples of a modest Queen Anne house, a style more frequently seen than the more elaborate Queen Anne houses found on Pleasant Street.

Early life Stein was born to a Jewish family in Chicago. Her father was Jules C. Stein (1896‚Äì1981), founder of the Music Corporation of America (MCA) and the Jules Stein Eye Institute at University of California, Los Angeles. Her mother, Doris J. Stein (1902‚Äì1984), established the Doris Jones Stein Foundation. Jean Stein's sister, Susan Shiva, died of breast cancer (1983), as did Doris Stein. Stein was educated at the Katharine Branson School in Ross, California, then at Brillantmont International School in Lausanne, Switzerland, after which she graduated from Miss Hewitt's Classes in New York City. Thereafter, she spent two years at Wellesley College and then attended classes at the University of Paris (formerly known as the Sorbonne). While in Paris she interviewed William Faulkner, with whom she had an affair, and, according to the historian Joel Williamson, offered the interview to The Paris Review in exchange for being made an editor there. Career Stein returned to New York and worked in 1955 as assistant to director Elia Kazan on the original production of Tennessee Williams's Pulitzer Prize winning play Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. Stein was the author of three books and a pioneer of the narrative form of oral history. Her final work was a cultural and political history of Los Angeles, West of Eden, published by Random House in February 2016. In 1970, Stein authored, with George Plimpton as editor, a biography of Robert F. Kennedy, titled American Journey: The Times of Robert Kennedy. With Plimpton, Stein co-wrote the best-selling book Edie: American Girl, based on the life of socialite/actress and Andy Warhol muse Edie Sedgwick, in 1982. Norman Mailer wrote of Edie: \\"This is the book of the Sixties that we have been waiting for.\\" Stein also worked as a magazine editor. In the late 1950s she was an editor, with Plimpton, at The Paris Review. From 1990 to 2004, she was editor of the literary/visual arts magazine Grand Street with art editor Walter Hopps. The magazine actively sought out international authors, visual artists, composers and scientists to bring to its readership. Legacy In 2017, Stein partnered with PEN America to launch the PEN/Jean Stein Book Award and the PEN/Jean Stein Grant for Oral History to honor groundbreaking literature. The annual $75,000 PEN/Jean Stein Book Award, which is awarded to a book of fiction, memoir, essay, or nonfiction, ‚Äúfocuses global attention on remarkable books that propel experimentation, wit, strength, and the expression of wisdom.‚Äù Hisham Matar, a Libyan-American writer, won the 2017 inaugural award for his memoir, The Return. The $10,000 PEN/Jean Stein Grant for Oral History is awarded to support the completion of a ‚Äúliterary work of nonfiction that uses oral history to illuminate an event, individual, place, or movement.‚Äù Personal life Stein's first marriage in 1958 was to William vanden Heuvel, a lawyer who served in the U.S. Justice Department under Robert F. Kennedy, and who later also became a diplomat and author. Since 1984, he has been the chairman of the Roosevelt Institute. Their first daughter, Katrina vanden Heuvel, was born in 1959; she is now the editor and publisher of The Nation magazine. The couple's second daughter, Wendy vanden Heuvel, was born in 1961, and she is an actress and producer in New York. She is also on the board of the 52nd Street Project, which matches inner-city youth with professional theater artists to create original dramatic works. From 1995 to 2007, Stein was married to Torsten Wiesel, a co-recipient with David H. Hubel of the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Suffering from depression, Stein apparently committed suicide by jumping from her Manhattan apartment on April 30, 2017. She was 83.

Liberty ship built in New Orleans, Louisiana Basilan (ARG 12) originally projected as the EC-2 \\"Liberty Ship\\" Jacques Phillipe Villere‚Äîwas laid down on 5 February 1944 at New Orleans, Louisiana, by the Delta Shipbuilding Corporation. under a U.S. Maritime Commission contract (MCE hull 2460); redesignated as a miscellaneous auxiliary, AG-68, on 14 March 1944, and allocated for conversion in response to the urgent need for self-propelled special barracks-stores ships; launched on 21 March 1944; and sponsored by Mrs. Percy H. Brown. Delivered to the Navy on 21 April 1944, Basilan was placed in reduced commission that same day for the voyage from New Orleans to Mobile, Alabama. Placed out of commission at the latter port on 24 April 1944, she underwent conversion for her new role as a combined barracks- stores-distilling ship by the Waterman Steamship Company; and was recommissioned at Mobile on 10 October 1944, Lt. Comdr. Lawrence A. Parks, USNR, in command.  World War II service   East coast operations Ordered to proceed to Pilottown, Louisiana, on 21 October, Basilan departed as directed and there joined convoy HK-293 on 22 October. She reached Key West, Florida, on 25 October, joining convoy KN-346 later the same day and proceeding thence to Norfolk, Virginia. Anchoring in Hampton Roads on 31 October, the ship moved into Chesapeake Bay the following morning. After shakedown training, Basilan entered drydock to undergo repairs and the installation of her evaporators at the Norfolk Navy Yard from 5 to 25 November, after which time she shifted to the Naval Operating Base (NOB), Norfolk, to load supplies. Underway on the morning of 4 December, Basilan proceeded independently to New York City, arriving at her destination the following afternoon. Proceeding thence in convoy on the afternoon of 7 December, she arrived at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on the morning of the 14th. She sailed on the afternoon of 15 December in convoy GZ-109 for Panama, reaching the Panama Canal and commencing her transit of the isthmian waterway on the morning of 19 December. Drydocked that same afternoon at Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, for the complete realignment of her engine crankshaft, Basilan underwent repairs into the new year 1945.  Pacific theatre operations After her main engine broke down during the post-repair trials on 15 January 1945, she was towed back to Balboa for additional work that lasted over almost a fortnight. Following a successful post-repair trial run, Basilan shaped a course, proceeding independently, for Pearl Harbor on 27 January. Three- quarters of an hour into the afternoon watch on 1 February, however, she received dispatch orders re-directing her to San Francisco, California, for reconversion to an \\"electronic repair and staff maintenance ship.\\" She reached the Bethlehem Steel Company's shipyard at San Francisco on 12 February. Shifting to the Naval Supply Depot to unload stores two days later, she returned to Bethlehem Steel's yard on 20 February. She remained there, undergoing conversion for her new role, through the end of March 1945. Underway for the Western Caroline Islands on 1 April, Basilan arrived at Ulithi Atoll on the 24th, reporting for duty with Service Squadron (ServRon) 10 and assignment to work in conjunction with Jason (ARH-1). The skilled artificers of Basilan's ship repair unit (SRU) worked alongside those of Jason and under the direction of the latter's repair officer. Simultaneously, the workload of \\"installing, maintaining and repairing electronic equipment\\" kept Basilan's electronic repair force busy. The advent of the typhoon season made it imperative to shift ServRon 10's principal base of operations from the Western Carolines to the Philippine Islands. With the selection of San Pedro Bay, Leyte Gulf, as the base site, the movement toward Leyte began on 7 May. Basilan sailed with the fourth increment of ServRon 10 on 20 May, and reached her destination on 25 May. ServRon 10's maintenance staff (later designated as Service Division 101, Maintenance) reported on board on 28 May. Basilan carried out her support mission in Philippine waters as the Pacific War progressed to its victorious conclusion that summer. During her time in Leyte Gulf, again working with Jason, she also provided important services in conjunction with the modern repair ship Ajax (AR-6) and the veterans Vulcan (AR-5) and Prometheus (AR-3). Basilan's \\"skilled workmen in (the ship's) SRU and electronic repair forces,\\" her chronicler noted modestly, performed \\"commendable work on such ships as the Missouri (BB-63), Bennington (CV-20), Randolph (CV-15), Essex (CV-9), and others‚Ä¶ \\"Her unique equipment also enabled her to fulfill another key sustaining role in supporting the forces afloat. \\"Due to our large evaporator capacity,\\" her historian later wrote, \\"we were able to issue water to many of the LCIs (infantry landing craft), LCS's (support landing craft) and other small craft.\\" End-of-war operations On 13 September, Basilan stood out of Leyte Gulf, bound for Jinsen (later Inchon), Korea, to participate in the occupation of that former Japanese territory, briefly retracing her course in response to warnings of two typhoons crossing her proposed course. Earmarked for disposal on 21 September, the ship nevertheless remained on occupation duty, first at Jinsen and later at Shanghai, China, into the late autumn of 1945. Basilan concluded her occupation work on 2 December, when she sailed from Shanghai, bound for Pearl Harbor, arriving at her destination on Christmas Day 1945. She sailed for the Pacific Northwest two days later. Reaching Seattle, Washington, on 6 January 1946, Basilan began pre-inactivation overhaul soon thereafter. Before stripping could be completed, however, on 22 February the ship received orders to report to Commandant, 14th Naval District, for berthing and eventual assignment to Joint Task Force (JTF) 1 being constituted to take part in the atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll (Operation Crossroads). On 25 February, the ship departed for Pearl Harbor, and reached her destination on 8 March.  Post-war decommissioning Decommissioned at Pearl on 22 April 1946, Basilan, never ultimately employed in Crossroads, remained in Hawaiian waters until 30 March 1947, when she sailed, in tow of tug VO-69, and in company with the fleet tug Abnaki (ATF-96) and five other small tugs and their tows, for San Francisco, California. Reaching Drake's Bay on 15 April, she was turned over, having been stripped, to the U.S. Maritime Commission on 14 May. Her name was stricken from the Naval Register on 28 May 1947, and the ship remained in the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay, California, until 12 June 1972 when she was sold to Zidell Explorations, Inc., for scrapping.

Early Years Woolams was born on February 14, 1917 (Valentine's Day) to Leonard and Elsa Woolams in San Francisco, CA and raised in the suburb of Ross, California. Woolams attended the University of Chicago for two years before joining the United States Army Air Corps. He served on active duty for approximately eighteen months, after which he returned to the University of Chicago and graduated with a degree in economics in June 1941. Career and flight records Woolams joined Bell Aircraft later that month and was soon transferred from the test flight division to the experimental research division. In September 1942, he became the first person to fly a fighter aircraft coast to coast over the United States without stopping. In the summer of 1943, he set a new altitude record of 47,600 feet. He became chief test pilot for Bell in 1944, and was the first to fly the Bell X-1 and the only one to pilot the plane at the Pinecastle facility in Orlando, Florida. Personality Author Sterling Michael Pavelec records that Woolams once joined a group of trainee pilots while flying the experimental P-59 jet airplane. The trainees, surprised to see a plane flying without propellers, were astonished to see Woolams flying the plane wearing an old Halloween gorilla mask, a bowler hat and smoking a cigar. Woolams waved at them and flew away. Death and legacy Woolams' career ended abruptly on August 30, 1946. He was killed in the P-39 \\"Cobra I\\" during a practice flight for the National Air Races in Cleveland, Ohio that were to occur the next day. Woolams flew the Cobra I from Cleveland back to Bell Aircraft in Niagara Falls on August 29, after obtaining a disappointing qualifying speed of 392 mph. Woolams was testing the plane over Lake Ontario, late in the afternoon, possibly at speeds over 400 mph. It suddenly and inexplicably crashed into the water, breaking apart upon impact. His body was recovered 4 days later. After the wreckage of Cobra I was recovered, it was believed a canopy failure was the cause of the crash and Woolams' death. There was internal debate at Bell Aircraft as whether to continue with the race or not, but Woolams' teammate and fellow Bell test pilot, Tex Johnston, insisted that Woolams would have raced if it was the other way around. The day after Woolams' death, Johnston went on to win the 1946 Thompson Trophy in the Cobra II, the identical twin of Cobra I.

The precise meaning depends on context. Fabric after leaving the Loom or Knitting machine, is not readily useable. It is called grey cloth at this stage, it contains natural and added impurities. Sometimes it is also processed at fiber or yarn stages of textile manufacturing. Grey fiber or yarn or fabric goes through a series of processes such as wet processing and finishing. Finishing is a broad range of physical and chemical processes/treatments that complete one stage of textile manufacturing and may be preparing for the next step. And makes the product more receptive to the next stage of manufacturing. Finishing adds value to the product and makes it more attractive, useful, and functional for the end-user. Improving surface feel, aesthetics, and addition of advanced chemical finishes are some examples of textile finishing. Some finishing techniques such as bleaching and dyeing are applied to yarn before it is woven while others are applied to the grey cloth directly after it is woven or knitted. Some finishing techniques, such as fulling, became outdated with the industrial revolution while others, such as mercerisation, are developments following the Industrial Revolution. Introduction In order to impart the required functional properties to the fiber or fabric, it is customary to subject the material to different types of physical and chemical treatments. For example, wash and wear finish for a cotton fabric is necessary to make it crease-free or wrinkle-free. In a similar way, mercerising, singeing, flame retardant, water repellent, waterproof, anti-static and peach finishing achieve various fabric properties desired by consumers. The use of 100% synthetic textiles has increased considerably since the development of textured yarns made of filaments and the growing production of knit goods. The use of open weave has enabled the production of lighter, breathable, fabrics to ensure better wearing comfort. The properties of petroleum-based synthetic fibers, most important among them being polyamide, polyester and polyacrylonitrile, are essentially different from those of natural cellulosic and protein/ wool fibers. Hence the sequence of finishing operations is likely to be different. While cellulosic fabrics require a resin finishing treatment to impart easy-care properties, synthetic fibers already exhibit these easy-care criteria and require only a heat setting operation. Finishing of cotton Purification and preliminary processes The grey cloth‚Äîwoven cotton fabric in its loom-state‚Äînot only contains impurities, including warp size, but requires further treatment in order to develop its full textile potential. Furthermore, it may receive considerable added value by applying one or more finishing processes. =Singeing= Singeing is designed to burn off the surface fibres from the fabric to produce smoothness. The fabric passes over brushes to raise the fibres, then passes over a plate heated by gas flames. =Desizing= Depending on the size that has been used, the cloth may be steeped in a dilute acid and then rinsed, or enzymes may be used to break down the size. =Scouring= Scouring is a chemical washing process carried out on cotton fabric to remove natural wax and non-fibrous impurities (e.g. the remains of seed fragments) from the fibres and any adventitious oil, soiling or dirt. Scouring was used to carry in iron vessels called kiers. The fabric was boiled in an alkali, which forms a soap with free fatty acids (saponification). A kier is usually enclosed, so the solution of sodium hydroxide can be boiled under pressure, excluding oxygen which would degrade the cellulose in the fibre. If the appropriate reagents are used, scouring will also remove size from the fabric although desizing often precedes scouring and is considered to be a separate process known as fabric preparation. Preparation and scouring are prerequisites to most of the other finishing processes. At this stage even the most naturally white cotton fibres are yellowish, and bleaching, the next process, is required. =Bleaching= Bleaching improves whiteness by removing natural coloration and remaining trace impurities from the cotton; the degree of bleaching necessary is determined by the required whiteness and absorbency. Cotton being a vegetable fibre will be bleached using an oxidizing agent, such as dilute sodium hypochlorite or dilute hydrogen peroxide. If the fabric is to be dyed a deep shade, then lower levels of bleaching are acceptable, for example. However, for white bed sheetings and medical applications, the highest levels of whiteness and absorbency are essential. =Mercerising= A further possibility is mercerizing, during which the fabric is treated with a caustic soda solution to cause swelling of the fibres. This results in improved luster, strength, and dye affinity. Cotton is mercerized under tension, and all alkali must be washed out before the tension is released or shrinkage will take place. Mercerizing can take place directly on grey cloth, or after bleaching. Coloration Color is a sensation caused when white light from a source such as the sun is reflected off a pigment on the surface. The pigment selectively reflects certain wavelengths of light while absorbing others. A dye can be considered as a substance that can be fixed to a material that has these properties. The colour it reflects is defined by the structure of the molecule, and particularly the parts of the chromogen molecule called the chromophore group. There are two processes used to apply colour: =Dyeing= Cotton is an absorbent fibre which responds readily to colouration processes. Dyeing is commonly carried out with an anionic direct dye by completely immersing the fabric (or yarn) in an aqueous dyebath according to a prescribed procedure. For improved fastness to washing, rubbing, and light, other dyes such as vats and reactives are commonly used. These require more complex chemistry during processing and are thus more expensive to apply. =Printing= Printing is the application of colour in the form of a paste or ink to the surface of a fabric, in a predetermined pattern. It may be considered as localised dyeing. Printing designs on to already dyed fabric is also possible. The common processes are block printing, roller printing and screen printing Finishing =Mechanical finishing= Raising Another finishing process is raising. During raising, the fabric surface is treated with sharp teeth to lift the surface fibres, thereby imparting hairiness, softness, and warmth, as in flannelette. Calendering Calendering is the third important mechanical process, in which the fabric is passed between heated rollers to generate smooth, polished or embossed effects depending on roller surface properties and relative speeds. =Chemical finishing= Many other chemical treatments may be applied to cotton fabrics to produce low flammability, crease resist and other special effects. =Shrinking= Mechanical shrinking (sometimes referred to as sanforizing), whereby the fabric is forced to shrink width and/or lengthwise, creates a fabric in which any residual tendency to shrink after subsequent laundering is minimal. Standard finishes  Quality- oriented  * Calendering * Decatising * Desizing for woven fabrics. * Pressing * Scouring with detergents, alkaline solutions, or enzymes removes foreign matter. * Shrinking, Sanforization * Shearing or singeing smooths the fabric by removing the fine protruding fibers on the surface of the fabric. Flame singeing is the standard process: the wet fabric is passed through an array of gas burners at a suitable distance to burn the pills off of its surface. Design-oriented * Bleaching of woven fabrics removes any prior color in order to obtain a uniform color during the dying process. * Dyeing adds color. * Printing adds color and pattern. * Watering adds moir√© patterns. Handle-oriented * Fulling or waulking adds weight and density. * Hydrophobic finishing with a durable water repellent produces a fabric that repels stains or water. * Weighting silk with metallic salts or polymer adds weight and improves handle. Special finishes for natural fibers * Bio- polishing removes the protruding fibers of fabric with the action of an enzyme. Enzymes, such as cellulase for cotton, selectively remove protruding fibers. These enzymes may be deactivated by an increase in temperature and shifting pH. * Mercerisation makes the woven cotton fabric stronger, more lustrous, better dye affinity, and less abrasive. * Raising lifts the surface fibers to improve the softness and warmth, as in flannelette. * Peach Finish subjects the fabric (either cotton or its synthetic blends) to emery wheels, making the surface velvet-like. This is a special finish used mostly in garments. * Fulling or waulking was a method of thickening woolen material to make it more water-resistant. * Decatising to bring dimension stability to woollen fabrics. * Calendering makes one or both surfaces of the fabric smooth and shiny. The fabric is passed to through hot, fast-moving stainless steel cylinders. * Compacting it is the advance version of the calendering machine and suitable for knitted fabric to achieve desired gsm and to set width, for calendering and shrinkages control simultaneously. The compactors machines comes in both tube and open width settings. * Sanforizing or Pre-shrinking prevents a fabric and the produced garment from shrinking after production. This is also a mechanical finish, acquired by feeding the fabric between a roller and rubber blanket, in such a way the rubber blanket compresses the weft threads and imparts compressive shrinkage. * Crease-Resist finish or \\"wash-and-wear\\" or \\"wrinkle-free\\" finishes are achieved by the addition of a chemical resin finish that makes the fiber take on a quality similar to that of synthetic fibers. * Anti-microbial finish causes the fabric to inhibit the growth of microbes. The humid and warm environment found in textile fibers encourages the growth of the microbes. Infestation by microbes can cause cross-infection by pathogens and the development of odor where the fabric is worn next to the skin. In addition, stains and loss of fiber quality of textile substrates can also take place. With an aim to protect the skin of the wearer and the textile substrate itself, an anti-microbial finish is applied to textile materials. * Antiviral finishes on textiles are a further exploitation of using antimicrobial surfaces that are applicable to both natural and synthetic textiles. Exhibiting antiviral properties, these surfaces may inactivate the lipid coated viruses. * Self cleaning surface finish on cellulosic materials like cotton, treated materials clean themselves of stains and remove odors when exposed to sunlight. The fabric is coated with N-TiO2 film and lAgI particles. Special finishes for synthetic fibers * Heat-setting of synthetic fabrics eliminates the internal tensions within the fiber, generated during manufacturing, and the new state can be fixed by rapid cooling. This heat setting fixes the fabrics in the relaxed state, and thus avoids subsequent shrinkage or creasing of the fabric. Presetting of goods makes it possible to use higher temperatures for setting without considering the sublimation properties of dyes and also has a favorable effect on dyeing behavior and the running properties of the fabric. On the other hand, post- setting can be combined with some other operations such as Thermasol dyeing or optical brightening of polyester. Post-setting as a final finish is useful to achieve high dimensional stability, along with the desired handle. Post heat setting may cause poor wash fastness in disperse dyed fabrics because of sublimation. Heat-setting is an important part of finishing synthetic or blended fabrics. * Stiffening and filling process: A stiffening effect is desirable in certain polyamides and polyester materials (e.g. petticoats, collar inner linings), which can be done by reducing the mutual independence of structural elements of fabric by polymer deposition on coating as a fine film. * Hydrophilic finishes compensate for lower moisture and water absorption capacity in synthetic fiber materials, which become uncomfortable in contact with skin. Certain products, based on modified (oxy-ethylated) polyamides, make the fabric more pleasant by reducing the cohesion of water so that it spreads over a larger area and thus evaporates more readily. * Anti- pilling finish alleviates pilling, an unpleasant phenomenon associated with spun yarn fabrics, especially when they contain synthetics. Synthetic fibers are more readily brought to the surface of fabric due to their smooth surface and circular cross-section, and due to their higher tensile strength and abrasion resistance. With knit \\"picking\\" also occurs: by abrasion, individual fibers work themselves out of yarn loops onto the surface, and the garment catches on a pointed or rough object. Knitting is susceptible to these effects due to the open weave and bulky yarn. * Anti-static finish prevents dust from clinging to the fabric. Anti-static effective chemicals are largely chemically inert and require Thermasol or heat treatment for fixing on polyester fabrics. Polyether agents have been found to be useful but should not affect the dye- equilibrium on fiber, lest they impair the rubbing fastness. In general, Thermasol anti-static agents also have a good soil release action, which is as permanent as the anti-static effect. Anti-static finishes may also be of polyamide type, being curable at moderate temperatures. * Non-slip finishes give the filaments a rougher surface. Synthetic warp and weft threads in loosely woven fabrics are particularly prone to slip because of their surface smoothness when the structure of the fabric is disturbed and appearance is no longer attractive. Silica gel dispersions or silicic acid colloidal solutions are used in combination with latex polymer or acrylates dispersions to get a more permanent effect, along with simultaneous improvement in resistance to pilling or snagging. These polymer finishes are also capable of imparting a soft and smooth handle to synthetic fabric without making it water repellent. * Fire Resistant or Flame Retardant finish: to reduce flammability. * Anti- microbial finish: with the increasing use of synthetic fibers for carpets and other materials in public places, anti-microbial finishes have gained importance. Products that are commonly applied are brominated phenols, quaternary ammonium compounds, organo-silver, and tin compounds, which can be applied as solutions or dispersions. They can also be incorporated in a polymeric film deposited on the surface to achieve a controlled release.

In the townland of Rath, to the north of the town centre, a Bronze Age settlement was found during the construction of the M2 motorway. Excavations in the vicinity of the cemetery of Killegland revealed the extent of the early Christian settlement, with souterrains, house sites and a large enclosure centred around the remains of the church that is visible in the cemetery. This would link the townland name of Killegland - meaning Declan's Church - to pre-Patrician settlement in the area. Archaeological excavations on the site of Lidl supermarket revealed the original medieval town, with several house remains, associated field systems, fish traps and mill races. Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath, set about building fortified houses, called mottes and baileys, in case the native Irish would regroup and attack. The remains of a motte and bailey can be found in Ratoath 5 km from Ashbourne. Once settled, Hugh de Lacy divided the land among his army. A large portion at Killeglan was given to a family called Wafre in 1220. This family lived there until 1420, the last member of this family having built a tower house (a fortified house often called a castle). The castle and lands became the property of the Segrave family, who remained owners until 1649. The first of the family recorded in Meath, Richard Sydgrave, was Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer 1423-5. They became one of the most influential and wealthy non-aristocratic families in Ireland during the 16th century, with two gaining the high political office of Chancellor of the Exchequer, while another became High Sheriff of Meath; Richard Segrave ( died 1598) and his son Patrick Segrave were both judges of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland). However, their political power and possessions were removed during the religious wars of 1641 to 1650. Indeed, during the Cromwellian period, Oliver Cromwell's son, Henry, stayed for a time in Killeglan Castle. With the final subjugation of the native Irish after 1690, and the imposition of religious persecution in the Penal Laws, a new land- owner named Thomas Carter gained possession of the Killeglan lands. He did not live there, and the castle fell into dis-repair and eventually into ruin. The Carter family held high office in Irish politics during the 18th century but their fortunes waned in the early 19th century. When the Carter estates were sold in the 1840s, the Killegland lands were bought by Frederick Bourne. Frederick Bourne was a rich entrepreneur who made his fortune from roads and transport. Before 1820 in Ireland roads were almost non-existent. Government regulations allowed for considerable spending on roads, and the subsequent improvements ensured greater post-coach services. Bourne owned a coach company and financed road-building, collecting revenue from tolls. He financed a ten- mile (old Irish miles) section of road from Dublin to Killegland. He decided to build a small town with an inn, a hotel and other small businesses to make money from travellers. He built this village near his ten-mile tollbooth and named the place after his favourite tree, and himself, i.e. Ash and Bourne. This began in 1820. Bourne's idea was a success. However, by 1850 rail was taking business from the roadways, and the Bourne family fortune declined. In 1821 the population was 133, by 1841 it was 411. The Irish famine took a toll from 1845 to 1851, and the population declined. Frederick Bourne left his land at Killegland, and his village of Ashbourne, to his son Richard in 1844. Richard lived in the village, and his first home is now the Ashbourne House Hotel on Frederick Street. Later he built a modest house on Castle Street near where the last remains of the Wafre and Segrave tower house were. Richard married the daughter of a wealthy local family, Elizabeth Mangan, and had several children. The eldest, Thomas, became his father's heir and the last landlord of Ashbourne. He left Ireland and went to live in Northfleet, Kent, England, in 1899. The land was sold to the local tenants. Population Ashbourne's main street Ashbourne was a small village with a population under 400 until 1970. In response to the growing population of nearby Dublin, a new scheme of houses was built in Ashbourne, based on the American open plan scheme rather than with fenced-off gardens. The population of the town was 8,528 as of the 2006 census, a 34% increase on the previous census in 2002. The population in 2013 was recorded at 14,000 people approximately, making it Meath's second largest town after Navan and the largest town in the new Meath East D√°il constituency, which elects 3 TDs to the D√°il. This growth coincided with a change in Ashbourne's demographics, with the 2006 census showing that over 12% of Ashbourne's population was born outside Ireland. The Lithuanian community is the second largest minority in Ashbourne after people from the United Kingdom. Almost one fifth of all non-Irish born in the town are from Lithuania. Lithuanian language services are held in the Church of the Immaculate Conception. The Polish community in Ashbourne is the second-largest in Meath after Navan. Ashbourne House Hotel Transport Public transport Apartments in centre of Ashbourne Ashbourne is served by two public transport companies. Ashbourne Connect links the town with an express coach service direct to Dublin city centre and the southside of the city. The service is listed as 193 on the national journey planner. Bus √âireann provide a regular service (Route 103) from Beresford Place, Dublin, every 20 minutes. Some of these services continue on to Ratoath, Kilmoon Cross and Duleek. At the beginning of March 2010, a regular service to and from Navan via Dunshaughlin and Ratoath to Dublin Airport that had previously not passed through Ashbourne was rerouted to serve the Pillo Hotel at the northern end of the town, and to then go through the town to the airport and Dublin City University. The service (route 109A) runs every hour from early morning to late evening. The 104 service that ran from Ashbourne to Blanchardstown Shopping Centre was discontinued at the same time, and replaced by some of the 105 service being extended from Ratoath to also serve Ashbourne. Route 177, with a low frequency, also served Ashbourne from Dublin, and went on to Slane, Ardee and Monaghan, with extensions to Clones but was withdrawn in November 2013. There is also a very limited service (Route 107) from Kingscourt to Dublin via Ashbourne. In November 2013 routes 189 & 189A were introduced linking Ashbourne to Drogheda and Clogherhead. Bus √âireann has not offered any express services using the new road, as expected when it first opened, and continue to use the old (R135) road for most services until Kilshane, where the R135 has an exit to the Dublin Airport Logistics Park and the N2. There is an informal, non-timetable Bus √âireann 103 service that occasionally runs via the M2 from Dublin to Ashbourne and the 107 Dublin-Navan-Kingscourt service also uses the M2 for an evening coach service at 5.40pm, leaving the M2 at Ashbourne South (exit 3) before continuing via the R135 and N2 north of Ashbourne towards Kentstown and Navan. Dublin Bus use the N2 as far as Cherryhound (exit 2) for their 88N Nitelink service to Ashbourne. Road Ashbourne is linked to the M50 and Dublin City by 17 kilometres of motorway/high quality dual carriageway on the N2/M2 national primary route, which commences at junction 5 of the M50 motorway (13.5 km from Ashbourne). The road is a six-lane dual-carriageway from the M50 until exit 2, Cherryhound in Co. Dublin, where it becomes a motorway from there to the Rath roundabout, 1.5 km north of Ashbourne. The M2 incorporates a bypass of Ashbourne. The N2/M2 bypass allows commuters and hauliers to avoid the town on routes south from County Donegal, County Londonderry, County Tyrone, County Monaghan, County Louth and the rest of County Meath. The South Ashbourne Interchange, a junction taking traffic on and off the N2 near the Nine Mile Stone, allows traffic to transfer to and from Ashbourne and its by-pass. Phase II of the M50 upgrade, opened in 2010, links the N2 to the M50 at exit 5 with a partial free-flow junction, meaning most traffic transferring from the M50 to the N2 and vice versa does not have to stop (traffic lights remain where traffic from the M50 southbound meets traffic from the N2 southbound). Amenities There is an 18-hole golf course, (founded 1991), on the outskirts of the town and several sports clubs in the town, including a Gaelic Athletic Association club, Donaghmore-Ashbourne, originally founded as Donaghmore in 1923 at the Wootton, and now with a new facility with pitches and clubhouse, with an indoor astro turf and two full-size Gaelic pitches opened at Killegland in 2006. There is also a rugby union team who play their matches at the Ashbourne rugby club (founded 1974) which has also has a new pitch and a small astro pitch which is sometimes used for 5-a-side soccer. There are also a number of soccer teams (including Ashbourne United, & Killegland FC), a cricket club Ashbourne cricket club behind the community centre, and a judo club. There is a community centre, opened in 1981 and upgraded in 2017, which has a sports hall with a full size basketball court, 3 badminton courts, squash court, handball & racquet ball court, and changing facilities and meeting rooms. The community centre is used by sporting organisations, including the St Andrews athletics club who also have facilities in the Arkle Pavilion in Greenogue on the outskirts of Ashbourne, Ashbourne Archers,http://www.ashbournearchers.com who run archery training courses and weekly shoots in the indoor hall of Donaghmore Ashbourne GAA. The International Baseball Centre (IBC) is located in Ashbourne behind the Ashbourne District Community Centre. The IBC is Ireland's only international standard baseball diamond, and home of the Ashbourne Baseball Club. The field has been the host of the International Baseball Festival (IBF) since 2015. Fairyhouse Racecourse is located 10 km from Ashbourne. Tayto Park opened in 2010 and has approximately 50 acres of activities, including one of Europe's largest wooden roller coasters, The C√∫ Chulainn Coaster, which opened in June 2015. The town's first cinema opened in Ashbourne Retail Park on 19 June 2009. The Sunday Tribune reported that the six-screen, 1,000-seat facility, which was Showtime Cinemas' first opening, has wall-to-wall screens, rocker seats, full digital projection and 3D capability. Council offices and Library Retail A series of shopping streets have been built as part of a scheme to give Ashbourne the type of retail centre more in keeping with other towns, these shopping facilities are in Ashbourne High Street and the crescent. Up until recently commercial development in the town was stifled given the fact that the town was bisected by a busy national primary route, the N2, on to which all commercial development was focused. This restricted the town's potential to attract high street retailers due to a lack of suitable sites and the associated traffic hazards of the N2. In 2002, a local area plan for the town was completed which provides for the future development of Ashbourne. The plan provided for a major expansion of Ashbourne westward into the townland of Killegland adjoining the new N2 Ashbourne bypass. It led to the introduction of residential units, a retail park, community facilities and industrial units. The town is being planned westward, further into County Meath, as the Fingal County boundary is only 1.5 kilometres (0.9 mi) from the east side of the town, which decreases to approximately 600 metres (2,000 ft) at the north end of the town, in the townland of Rath. Killegland Street, Ashbourne's retail area Of the streets developed in Ashbourne's \\"new\\" town centre, Killegland Street, has become a new commercial street containing a number of varied retail units along with a new library and council offices. Car parking in the town has been expanded thanks to both a large underground car park beneath Killegland Street (extending from Tesco to the Civic Offices) and a multi- storey car park above the retail units on the south end of the street. Bridge Street is an existing street between the Broadmeadow River and the Ashbourne House Hotel which contained just three dwellings and no retail outlets eight years ago now has five shops, a large hotel, dozens of apartments and a supermarket there. This is typical of the high pace of development in Ashbourne in the past decade. Dunnes Stores A large supermarket has opened a large store on the former Dardis & Dunns seed merchant site on the northern end of Frederick/Main Street as part of the Ashbourne Town Centre development and is accessible from both Frederick Street, across from Ashbourne's original town centre and Killegland Square, linking the new retail area to the established centre in the town. In 2007, Ashbourne Retail Park Limited applied for planning permission for an extension to the park. 1916 Rising monument According to R√≠ocht na M√≠dhe, the journal of the Meath Archaeological and Historical Society, on 28 April 1916 a group of Fingal Volunteers estimated to number 45 men, under the command of Thomas Ashe, a national school teacher in Lusk, and second in command Richard Mulcahy, attacked the Royal Irish Constabulary barracks at Ashbourne. The barracks were usually manned by a sergeant and four constables but given the level of fighting in the capital, reinforcements had been called in from surrounding barracks and so on the day of the attack, there were 10 RIC men stationed there. The rebels advanced on the barracks disarming two RIC men who were setting up a barricade outside the barracks. With these two men disarmed and captured, Ashe called on the remaining officers to surrender and immediately a siege situation turned into a shoot out. With little sign of capitulation on the RIC's part, it is believed the use of a home-made grenade resulted in them offering to surrender by waving a white handkerchief. However, before they could emerge the hoot of a car horn was heard to the north west. County Inspector Alexander Grey must have received word of the siege as he assembled between 54 and 67 men at Slane in 17 motorcars which were rushed to Ashbourne to put down the uprising. The rebels spread out and rushed along the Slane road to stop the convoy reaching Rath Cross and spreading out. The RIC reinforcements took heavy fire from the rebels from all sides. The firefight lasted many hours before volunteer reinforcements arrived from Boranstown. The RIC eventually surrendered to the volunteers. However, given that the uprising in Dublin had been put down the Fingal volunteers eventually gave themselves up two days later. Thomas Ashe and his men were sentenced to death for their part in the attack, but this was later commuted to penal servitude for life. The uprising at Ashbourne was not seen favourably in the local media at the time, with the Meath Chronicle calling it a \\"tragic blunder\\". Navan Urban District Council passed resolutions of sympathy. A number of local Catholic priests (Curragha & Ratoath) also spoke out against the attack. However, condemnation turned into sympathy with the execution of a number of prominent 1916 rebels who had fought in Dublin. President of Ireland, Sean T. O'Kelly, unveiled a memorial at Rath Cross Roads, Ashbourne, on Easter Sunday, 26 April 1959 which commemorates the Battle of Ashbourne. The story was covered on the front page of the Irish Times the next day. The memorial designed by Con O'Reilly and Peter Grant commemorates the battle and John Crenigan and Thomas Rafferty who were killed. The monument has two images: on one side the figure is in the form of Christ, on the other side is a rebel. This monument is known locally as the Rath Cross. It bears the following inscription; : ERECTED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE FINGAL BRIGADE OLD IRA TO COMMEMORATE THE VICTORIOUS BATTLE WHICH TOOK PLACE NEAR ASHBOURNE 28 APRIL 1916 WHERE VOLUNTEERS JOHN CRENIGAN & THOMAS RAFFERTY GAVE THEIR LIVES DESIGNED FROM THE POEM \\"LET ME CARRY YOUR CROSS FOR IRELAND LORD\\" COMPOSED BY THEIR LEADER COMMANDANT THOMAS ASHE On Easter Monday 2016, the State staged a number of national commemoration events. Rath Cross was one of only four such venues outside of Dublin City to be so honoured. On 25 September 2016, the monument was completed by the addition of two side figures; One representing the Volunteers in uniform, the other a family. Religion The Roman Catholic parish of Ashbourne extends south to Newtown Commons, east to Greenoge, north to Rath and west to Harlockstown. The Church of the Immaculate Conception is located in the centre of the town. In 1981, the parish was joined to Donaghmore, which has its own church to the south- east of Ashbourne. Sport Ashbourne is home to Longhorns Rugby League Club which was formed in 2005 and plays its home matches at Ashbourne Rugby Club. Longhorns were All-Ireland Rugby League champions in 2017, and received an invitation from the Rugby Football League to enter the 2018 Challenge Cup. Longhorns were drawn away to fellow amateurs West Hull, of the National Conference League Premier Division. The Ashbourne team scored two tries in a 58-10 defeat on 28 January 2018. Ashbourne is the home of the Ashbourne Baseball Club, an amateur baseball club that competes in the Irish Baseball League. The club fields teams in the Little League division as well as teams in the A and B divisions of the adult league. Up until 2019, the teams competed solely under the name, ‚ÄúAshbourne Giants‚Äù. Home games are played at the International Baseball Centre, an international standard baseball field located behind the Ashbourne District Community Centre.

Built as a planned development between 1918 and 1930, Orvis Road contains a well-preserved collection of single and double- family houses of the period, as well its distinctive landscaping, which includes a grassy median not found in Arlington's other planned subdivisions. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history Orvis Road is located in eastern Arlington, west of Lake Street and south of Massachusetts Avenue, major collector roadways in the area. Prior to subdivision, the land was part of the market garden farmland of John Squire. Development pressures in the early 20th century prompted many garden farmers to sell their land. Squire's land was attractively sited, with ready access to public transit and the road network. Orvis Road runs north-south between Massachusetts Avenue and Brooks Avenue, with a small circle just south of the latter. The road consists of two one-way sections, divided by a wide grassy median planted with trees and shrubs. The houses that line it are typically wood-frame structures, between 1-1/2 and 2-1/2 stories in height, some of which have been finished in stucco. Most of them are stylistically representative of the Colonial Revival of the Craftsman/Bungalow movement. Many of the properties have c. 1920s garages, indicating the growing importance of the automobile to local residents. There are a total of 26 properties included in the district; all front on Orvis Road, except the house at the southwest corner of Orvis and Newcomb Road, which has a Newcomb Road address.

The district features three houses that are in a transitional style between Federal and Greek Revival styles, dating from the 1830s. The houses are located at 122 and 123 Claremont Avenue, and 178 Oakland Avenue. These three houses were all built by members of the Peirce family, who were among the earliest settlers of the Arlington Heights area, and owned much of its land into the late 19th century.

Peirce House is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof and a central entry with sidelight windows. The form is basically Federal, but the decorative trim elements are Greek Revival in style, except for the early 20th-century entry hood. This house was built c. 1830. John A. P. Peirce House The John Peirce House is also a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, but it has a front-facing gable and three-bay facade, more firmly in the Greek Revival style. It has corner pilasters and a heavy raking cornice. It was built about 1835. Thomas Peirce House The Thomas Peirce House is the most elaborate of the three, with more substantial Greek Revival features than the John Peirce House. It also has the front- facing gable, with paneled pilasters, a full entablature, and a full- pedimented gable. A single-story porch extends across the front and wraps around the side.

It is notable for its aggressive portrayal of LSD use and the 1960s youth counterculture as vicious evils. Plot Adriana Roman, a successful stage actress, retires to marry Charles Winthrop, a wealthy tycoon. Winthrop's daughter, Lisa, is instantly distrustful of Adriana solely because she is \\"the other woman\\" taking her father's affection. Charles is killed in a boating accident, which also leads to Adriana suffering from a concussion. Lisa's new boyfriend Johnny Allen, a womanizing, fortune-hunting medical student, capitalizes on that distrust to persuade Lisa that her father's death was murder, a charge exacerbated by Adriana's threat‚Äîas per her late husband's instructions as laid out in his will, for which Adriana is executor‚Äîto disinherit Lisa if she marries Johnny. Johnny conspires with Lisa to lace Adriana's prescribed sedatives with enough LSD to drive her insane.

After their wedding, Johnny demonstrates that he doesn't really love Lisa by openly seducing other women, most notably Lisa's free-spirited best friend, Bibi. Johnny bribes Lisa to divorce him by providing a $100,000 settlement in return for keeping silent about what they did to Adriana. Lisa does divorce him, but instead of succumbing to Johnny's threats, she decides to come clean to Frederick Lansdale, a playwright friend of Adriana's who has always loved her himself, about what she and Johnny did. By this time, Adriana is suffering from amnesia, still believing that Charles is alive. Frederick decides to write a play detailing Adriana's traumatic experiences and casts her in the lead role. He hopes that replaying her experience on stage will cure her. By the opening performance, Adriana has glimpses from her memory of what has happened, not fully realizing what those fleeting thoughts are. By the climactic third act of the play, which details the tape-recorded subliminal messages Lisa and Johnny played during Adriana's hallucinations, Frederick decides to play the actual recordings with Lisa and Johnny's voices. This brings Adriana back to reality. She recognizes the voices and the fact that Lisa and Johnny use her real name as opposed to her character's name in the play. Lisa rushes onto the stage, admitting to Adriana what she and Johnny did. In a rage, Adriana slaps Lisa in the face. The play and Adriana's performance are a huge hit, Adriana and Frederick are about to be married, and Lisa has reconciled with Adriana. Meanwhile, Johnny has begun taking his own LSD while being shunned by his so-called friends. He is last seen on the floor in the midst of an LSD trip. Cast Production Development The film was based on a story by Tito Davison and Edmundo B√°ez, the latter of whom served as director. In January 1968, Motion Pictures International (MPI) negotiated a co-production agreement with the Mexico-based Producciones Anco to produce the film, based on a screenplay written by William Douglas Lansford. Filming The film was shot on location in Mexico, primarily at the Studios Churbusco in Mexico City, as well as on the coastal island of Cozumel, on a budget of US$560,000. The shooting schedule was scheduled to last approximately eight weeks. The decision to shoot the film abroad was to dually help bolster Mexico's film market, as well as help lower production costs, which were estimated to be $300,000 more if filmed in the United States. Release Box office The Big Cube was released theatrically in the United States on April 30, 1969, opening regionally in Cincinnati, Ohio. It continued to open in several U.S. cities throughout May 1969, including Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Chicago, Illinois; Portland, Oregon; and Boston, Massachusetts. The film opened in Los Angeles on May 21, 1969, though New York City engagements did not begin until January 1970. Home media The Big Cube was released on DVD in 2007 as part of Volume 2 of Warner Brothers' Cult Camp Classic's \\"Women in Peril\\" series, a three-part series that included John Cromwell's Caged (1950) and the film that gave Joan Crawford her last starring role, Freddie Francis' Trog (1970).

The phase velocity cp (blue) and group velocity cg (red) as a function of water depth h for surface gravity waves of constant frequency, according to Airy wave theory. Quantities have been made dimensionless using the gravitational acceleration g and period T, with the deep-water wavelength given by L0 = gT2/(2œÄ) and the deep-water phase speed c0 = L0/T. The grey line corresponds with the shallow- water limit cp =cg = ‚àö(gh). The phase speed ‚Äì and thus also the wavelength L = cpT ‚Äì decreases monotonically with decreasing depth. However, the group velocity first increases by 20% with respect to its deep-water value (of cg = c0 = gT/(4œÄ)) before decreasing in shallower depths. In fluid dynamics, wave shoaling is the effect by which surface waves entering shallower water change in wave height. It is caused by the fact that the group velocity, which is also the wave- energy transport velocity, changes with water depth. Under stationary conditions, a decrease in transport speed must be compensated by an increase in energy density in order to maintain a constant energy flux. Shoaling waves will also exhibit a reduction in wavelength while the frequency remains constant. In shallow water and parallel depth contours, non-breaking waves will increase in wave height as the wave packet enters shallower water. This is particularly evident for tsunamis as they wax in height when approaching a coastline, with devastating results. Overview Waves nearing the coast change wave height through different effects. Some of the important wave processes are refraction, diffraction, reflection, wave breaking, wave‚Äìcurrent interaction, friction, wave growth due to the wind, and wave shoaling. In the absence of the other effects, wave shoaling is the change of wave height that occurs solely due to changes in mean water depth ‚Äì without changes in wave propagation direction and dissipation. Pure wave shoaling occurs for long- crested waves propagating perpendicular to the parallel depth contour lines of a mildly sloping sea-bed. Then the wave height H at a certain location can be expressed as: :H = K_S\\\\; H_0, with K_S the shoaling coefficient and H_0 the wave height in deep water. The shoaling coefficient K_S depends on the local water depth h and the wave frequency f (or equivalently on h and the wave period T=1/f). Deep water means that the waves are (hardly) affected by the sea bed, which occurs when the depth h is larger than about half the deep- water wavelength L_0=gT^2/(2\\\\pi). Physics When waves enter shallow water they slow down. Under stationary conditions, the wave length is reduced. The energy flux must remain constant and the reduction in group (transport) speed is compensated by an increase in wave height (and thus wave energy density). Convergence of wave rays (reduction of width b) at Mavericks, California, producing high surfing waves. The red lines are the wave rays; the blue lines are the wavefronts. The distances between neighboring wave rays vary towards the coast because of refraction by bathymetry (depth variations). The distance between wavefronts (i.e. the wavelength) reduces towards the coast because of the decreasing phase speed. Shoaling coefficient K_S as a function of relative water depth h/L_0, describing the effect of wave shoaling on the wave height ‚Äì based on conservation of energy and results from Airy wave theory. The local wave height H at a certain mean water depth h is equal to H=K_S\\\\;H_0, with H_0 the wave height in deep water (i.e. when the water depth is greater than about half the wavelength). The shoaling coefficient K_S depends on h/L_0, where L_0 is the wavelength in deep water: L_0=gT^2/(2\\\\pi), with T the wave period and g the gravity of Earth. The blue line is the shoaling coefficient according to Green's law for waves in shallow water, i.e. valid when the water depth is less than 1/20 times the local wavelength L=T\\\\,\\\\sqrt{gh}. For non-breaking waves, the energy flux associated with the wave motion, which is the product of the wave energy density with the group velocity, between two wave rays is a conserved quantity (i.e. a constant when following the energy of a wave packet from one location to another). Under stationary conditions the total energy transport must be constant along the wave ray ‚Äì as first shown by William Burnside in 1915. For waves affected by refraction and shoaling (i.e. within the geometric optics approximation), the rate of change of the wave energy transport is: :\\\\frac{d}{ds}(b c_g E) = 0, where s is the co-ordinate along the wave ray and b c_g E is the energy flux per unit crest length. A decrease in group speed c_g and distance between the wave rays b must be compensated by an increase in energy density E. This can be formulated as a shoaling coefficient relative to the wave height in deep water. For shallow water, when the wavelength is much larger than the water depth ‚Äì in case of a constant ray distance b (i.e. perpendicular wave incidence on a coast with parallel depth contours) ‚Äì wave shoaling satisfies Green's law: :H\\\\, \\\\sqrt[4]{h} = \\\\text{constant}, with h the mean water depth, H the wave height and \\\\sqrt[4]{h} the fourth root of h. Water wave refraction Following Phillips (1977) and Mei (1989), denote the phase of a wave ray as :S = S(\\\\mathbf{x},t), \\\\qquad 0\\\\leq S<2\\\\pi. The local wave number vector is the gradient of the phase function, :\\\\mathbf{k} = abla S, and the angular frequency is proportional to its local rate of change, :\\\\omega = -\\\\partial S/\\\\partial t. Simplifying to one dimension and cross-differentiating it is now easily seen that the above definitions indicate simply that the rate of change of wavenumber is balanced by the convergence of the frequency along a ray; :\\\\frac{\\\\partial k}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\omega}{\\\\partial x} = 0. Assuming stationary conditions (\\\\partial/\\\\partial t = 0), this implies that wave crests are conserved and the frequency must remain constant along a wave ray as \\\\partial \\\\omega / \\\\partial x = 0. As waves enter shallower waters, the decrease in group velocity caused by the reduction in water depth leads to a reduction in wave length \\\\lambda = 2\\\\pi/k because the nondispersive shallow water limit of the dispersion relation for the wave phase speed, :\\\\omega/k \\\\equiv c = \\\\sqrt{gh} dictates that :k = \\\\omega/\\\\sqrt{gh}, i.e., a steady increase in k (decrease in \\\\lambda) as the phase speed decreases under constant \\\\omega.

Much as it was during the Golden Age of Piracy, the Bahamas was a haven for swashbucklers and blockade runners that were aligned with the Confederate States.

Florin Fodor (born 1974) is a citizen of Romania who made several attempts to enter Canada illegally. His last incursion was seen as remarkable, as he was the first illegal immigrant to attempt to slip into Canada surreptitiously through its vast and underpopulated Arctic. Fodor was first deported from Canada in 2000. He was deported again in 2006, when he is reported to have been returning to family in Canada. According to Royal Canadian Mounted Police Corporal Tim Waters, Fodor's attempt to enter Canada by water, from Greenland, was unprecedented‚Äîand dangerous. Fodor left Sisimiut, Greenland on September 11, 2006, in a 20-foot fibreglass boat he purchased there. He arrived at Grise Fiord eight days later, on September 18, 2006. When Fodor arrived in Grise Fiord he was almost out of food, and had only five litres () of fuel left. Fodor pleaded guilty in November 2006 to two charges of violating Canada's Immigration Act. He was sentenced to seven and a half months of detention. Justice Lise Maisonneuve ruled that Fodor should be deported when his sentence was complete. Nunavut's Premier, Eva Aariak, cited Grise Fjord's apprehension of Fodor in a speech she delivered to the Nunavut Legislature on February 19, 2009. Federal Ministers Chuck Strahl and Leona Aglukkaq were guests of the Legislature.

Its three volumes are Across the Face of the World, In the Earth abides the Flame (both published in 2004) and The Right Hand of God (published 2005).  Synopsis   Across the Face of the World  A prologue reveals Kannwar the Destroyer as he finalises his plans to invade and conquer the continent of Faltha. He muses on the torture-extracted confessions of a captured Dhaurian spy, who spoke of the plan of the Most High to save Faltha. These plans centre on the Right Hand, a mysterious entity, perhaps a person. The Destroyer plans to turn this Right Hand to evil, setting him up as a puppet ruler over Faltha. The story proper opens in Loulea, a small village and farming community at the western extremity of Faltha in the Kingdom of Firanes. Among Loulea's inhabitants is Leith Mahnumsen, a shy and introspective boy 16 years old, who lives with his mother Indrett and older (adopted) brother Hal. His father, Mahnum, was sent away on a spying mission two years earlier and never returned. The family as a whole is not held in high esteem in Loulea, consisting as it does of an (apparent) widow, Hal, who is crippled, and Leith, who is widely perceived as immature; Indrett is exasperated at the condescension of her fellow-villagers. Leith himself misses his father, but is also angry with him because Mahnum has apparently abandoned his family. He is also attracted to a village girl, Stella Pellwen. In the leadup to the Midwinter Festival, Leith finds himself doing odd jobs around the village, especially helping Kurr, an elderly farmer in the district. To his surprise and delight, Leith is selected to play the Summer character in the Midwinter Play, along with Stella. On the day of the Midwinter Festival, at the end of the Play, Mahnum returns from his long journey - and immediately takes Leith and the rest of the family home. Once in their house, Mahnum relates his story to them. He was sent to Bhrudwo by the King of Firanes, who had heard rumours about an impending invasion. Captured by servants of the Lords of Fear, the elite military unit of the Bhrudwan army, he was taken to Andratan, the Destroyer's island fortress. There he was tortured and interrogated about the Right Hand, told of a vast and intricate plan to invade and conquer Faltha, in which many Falthan courtiers and officials and even kings were already complicit, including the Regent of Firanes, and finally returned to the cells marked for death. He escaped with the assistance of a Bhrudwan, Vaniyo, who, apparently angry at the prospect of no reward, later betrayed him to the Lords of Fear. For the next year, Mahnum fled across Bhrudwo and Faltha, trying - but never succeeding - to shake their pursuit; having finally arrived home, he now plans to take his family into exile, hoping to keep Loulea safe from the ruthless Lords. They agree, and plan to leave in secret the very next morning. But during the night, the four Lords of Fear who have chased Mahnum arrive at their house. They abduct Mahnum and Indrett, and knock both Leith and Hal out before setting fire to their home. The Haufuth, Loulea's village chief, is awakened by the departing Lords in time to rescue Leith and Hal from the flames. Hearing their story, and aware that with traitors everywhere secrecy is of paramount importance, he stages their funerals, then seeks the advice of the old farmer Kurr, who has revealed that he is in fact a Watcher, a member of a centuries-old secret society dedicated to opposing a Bhrudwan invasion. Together with Leith and Hal, the Haufuth and Kurr concoct a desperate plan: they will pursue the Lords of Fear, rescue Mahnum and Indrett, and if possible capture one of the Lords, take him to Instruere and there, with an elite Bhrudwan soldier as evidence, alert the Council of Faltha to the approaching invasion. They are at this point surprised by Stella, who is herself shocked to see Leith and Hal alive; in order to avoid tales, they take Stella with them in their pursuit. Stella agrees to this, as it allows her to escape an impending marriage to the cruel Druin. Setting out on their pursuit, they first visit Kroptur, Kurr's mentor among the Watchers, a prophet and master of illusions. He introduces them to the Way of Fire, supernatural power which may be used for good or evil. They continue to the town of Mjolkbridge, where they encounter Farr and Wira Storrsen, brothers whose father was killed by the Lords of Fear as they travelled east. They allow the Storrsen brothers to accompany them, with dual reason being to provide them with some 'proper' protection (being healthy young men) and to allow them to seek revenge on behalf of their father. This group, which more often becomes referred to as 'the Company', receives a very cold welcome at the town of Windrise, but hire a townsman, Kaupa, as a guide across the high moors; Kaupa betrays them, leading them into an ambush of several ruffians from Windrise. The ambush fails, ending in the death of Kaupa and several other attackers. The Company continues onto the high and exposed Breidhan Moor, where snow, ice and bitter weather make travel slow and arduous. They are soon captured by a band of Fenni, losian inhabitants of the high plateaux, among whom they find Perdu, a lost cousin of Farr and Wira. Farr is surprised and scandalised that Perdu has chosen to remain among the Fenni, and his intemperate outbursts provoke a scuffle. The Company is apprehended and tried; Farr is sentenced to slavery or death, while the others are ordered to abandon their journey, and Perdu is exiled. In desperation, the Company attempt an escape, which is connived at by the tribal chief and priest, who believe the stars show the upcoming conflict with Bhrudwo and the pivotal role of the Company. They are secretly allowed to go, accompanied by Perdu, who is to free Parlevaag, a Fenni tribeswoman kidnapped by the Lords of Fear as they passed through; and they trade their horses for an aurochs, a far better beast of burden for their journey across the moors. They travel for many days through mountainous country. During this time, Stella and Wira gradually become romantically interested in each other; Leith discovers that Wira is an alcoholic and that Farr is blackmailing him, but keeps that knowledge to himself. They at last catch up with the Bhrudwans, who have awaited their arrival at the Maelstrom, a narrow gorge where a river enters a sinkhole in a whirlpool. There, they turn the tables on the Bhrudwans, and Stella, riding the aurochs, knocks one of the Lords of Fear into the river, where he perishes in the whirlpool. The three remaining Lords of Fear withdraw with their captives, and the Company resume their pursuit, following the Bhrudwans to Roleystone Bridge, at the very edge of the mountains; there, they find to their amazement that the Bhrudwans have destroyed the bridge and their road is blocked. While debating their course, they are surprised by a group of Fodhram, woodsmen and fur-trappers of Withwestwa Wood. The Fodhram agree to take the Company by forest trails to Vindstrop House, the next town on the Westway, hoping that the Lords of Fear will be delayed by the spring thaw, in return for assistance carrying their furs to market. Before setting out, they visit the Hermit, a mysterious man who dwells in a nearby cave; defying their expectations, he turns out to be an imposing middle-aged man with a gift for prophecy. He predicts greatness for Leith, and offers two signs to support his claims, but is upbraided by Hal, who questions the appropriateness of his timing. That night, Leith awakes to see Hal offering the Hermit, who is asleep, a chance to obey the Most High; when the Hermit agrees as though in a dream, Hal appears to Leith to grow a pair of insect wings, and does something to the Hermit's body. The next morning, the Hermit is found dangerously ill, with infected fly bites, and Leith is troubled and begins to mistrust Hal. The Fodhram and the Company set off, leaving the Haufuth, who is to nurse the Hermit back to health before following them to Instruere. The Company's journey through the woods is largely uneventful. Leith witnesses the two signs spoken to him by the Hermit. Later, Leith and Stella spend a night together, stranded on the ice of a frozen lake. After passing the dangerous Mossbank Cadence, the Company and the Fodhram arrive in Vindstrop House. Meanwhile, the Lords of Fear and their captives are caught in the spring thaw. The Company, heading back along the Westway, set up an ambush on the slopes of the volcano Steffl. In the ambush, two of the three remaining Lords of Fear are killed, and the last, an acolyte, is captured. But Wira is killed, and Leith, temporarily separated from the rest of the Company, is kidnapped by a Widuz raiding party. To be continued...  In the Earth Abides the Flame  The prologue reveals the current status of Deorc, Keeper of Andratan, which discusses some unknown plan kept secret from the Destroyer's own. Continuing on from the previous book, the Company have just entered Instruere after having been pursued by the Widuz, being saved only by the sacrifice of Parlevaag. Distraught, there they reunite with Leith, and acquaint for the first time with Phemenderac.  The Right Hand of God   People and places   General  With a few exceptions, the books are set on the continent of Faltha, which forms the north-western part of a large landmass (possibly a supercontinent) of unknown extent. Parts of the narrative occur in Bhrudwo, the north-eastern part of the same landmass.  Faltha  In the widest (geographical) sense, Faltha is a large continent in the north-western part of the known world. It is roughly analogous to Europe. Geographically, like Europe it is bounded on the east by mountains, rather than by a coastline; the culture and characteristics of many of its inhabitants also resemble those of medieval Europe. In a narrower political and cultural sense, Faltha is a loose federation of sixteen Kingdoms, each of which was founded by the First Men who were exiled from the Vale of Dona Mihst and their descendants. = Geography and climate = The geography of Faltha is widely varied. Faltha is bordered on the east by mountains: the Aldhras in the north, and the Armatura in the south. The Aldhras are Faltha's highest mountain range. Between these two mountain ranges is the Gap, the only known pass between Faltha and Bhrudwo. Draining much of central Faltha is the Aleinus River, which flows from a source near the Gap, gathering water from many tributaries, and reaches the sea in a broad tidal estuary downstream from the city of Instruere. = Peoples and cultures = Popularly, the peoples of Faltha are divided into two categories. These are the \\"First Men\\" and their descendants on the one hand, and the losian on the other. The First Men originally dwelt in the Vale of Dona Mihst, south of Faltha, in a covenant relationship with their deity, the Most High, and were granted very long lives and knowledge of the Way of Fire. In a succession of incidents now recalled as \\"the Poisoning\\", the majority of First Men were exiled from Dona Mihst; journeying north across the desert, they arrived at the Aleinus River. They founded sixteen kingdoms, a process partly caused by a bitter dispute over leadership between the clan heads Furist and Raupa. Losian are the other inhabitants of Faltha. Originally, the word losian, meaning \\"lost\\", was a technical term to refer to those inhabitants of Dona Mihst who voluntarily rejected the Way of Fire and left the Vale before the Poisoning, never to return. In popular usage, however, it has been extended to cover all human inhabitants of Faltha who are not descendants of those First Men who settled Faltha after the Poisoning. Since it is evident that many of these are not descended from the Lost of Dona Mihst, the origin of most losian remains unknown. Most losian live in tribal groupings in areas not yet effectively controlled by the Sixteen Kingdoms. Prominent examples of losian in the trilogy are the Fenni, the Fodhram, the Widuz, the peoples of the Mist, and the Pei-ra. Many other groups of losian exist. On a political level, relations between the First Men and the losian are often strained. Historically, the First Men have tended either to displace the original inhabitants or to expect them to adapt to First Man patterns of living, in a manner reminiscent of European colonialism. As a result, unconquered losian are now only found in harsh and remote areas. This has caused a good deal of bitterness for some groups of losian, such as the Widuz and the Mist. There are others who have become content with their new circumstances, but desire to be left alone; the Fenni, for example, deal swiftly and harshly with trespassers and have become an object of fear in northern legend. For their part, the statesmen of the Sixteen Kingdoms typically see the losian either as savages to be brought into civilisation, as enemies to be conquered, or using the principle of leaving well enough alone. Everyday contacts between First Men and losian are a mixed bag. On the one hand, racism is readily evident, as for example in Farr Storrsen's outbursts regarding the Fenni, and also the inhabitants of Windrise who he believes to engage in miscegenation. On the other hand, many of the First Men are content to trade with, work alongside and even enter into relationships with losian. The King of Favony, one of the Sixteen, for example, is part Wodranian. The cultures of the various losian groups draw to a large extent on those found in our world. In particular, the people of the Mist are based heavily on the MƒÅori, and the Pei-ra also borrow from Polynesian tradition. = Countries and cities = Faltha is divided into sixteen kingdoms, founded by the First Men, and large areas which are under the effective control of various losian tribes. In addition, certain regions are uninhabited and effectively beyond human influence. The Sixteen Kingdoms form a loose confederation. Each kingdom is essentially sovereign, managing not only its internal affairs but also trade, defence and foreign policy, to the extent of having the legal ability to go to war against others of the Sixteen; thus, for example, 24 years prior to the opening of the trilogy, Sna Vazthan armies overran the kingdom of Haurn, reducing it to a vassal state, and three years later attempted to do the same to Asgowan. The common government of Faltha rests in the hands of the Council of Faltha, consisting of one representative from each of the Sixteen Kingdoms; these representatives are called Arkhoi (singular Arkhos). Each Kingdom's Arkhos serves at the pleasure of his monarch. Legally, decisions made by the Council are binding on all Sixteen Kingdoms. In practice, the Council itself commands no armed forces except the Instruian Guard, and so is reliant on individual Kingdoms to enforce its dictates. The Council is a collegial body, with no provisions for a presiding officer; leadership of the Council is thus in the hands of the Arkhos who has the support of a majority of his fellow Arkhoi. Thus the Arkhos of Nemohaim was able to become the effective leader of the Council in the time leading up to the events of the trilogy.  Instruere  Instruere, called the Great City, is the largest and most populous urban centre in Faltha. Situated on an island in the midst of the Aleinus River, it is originally a conglomeration of two villages, Inna (populated by followers of Raupa) and Struere (settled by followers of Furist). The whole city is famous as a commercial centre, and is at the hub of traffic from Faltha's interior as well as the areas on the sea coasts. Instruere is fortified by a city wall, but the disruption to trade should the city be attacked is said to be a stronger defence than any wall. In this wall there are two great gates - the Inna and Struere Gates - and many smaller ones. Instruere contains sixteen markets, and is a tightly packed jumble of residential and commercial areas. The northern part of Instruere is strongly influenced by the culture of Deuverre, while the southern half is more similar to Straux. In the centre of Instruere lie the so-called Four Halls: the Pinion, which serves as a prison and torture chamber as well as the headquarters of the municipal armed forces, the Instruian Guard; the Hall of Lore, a museum and place of learning; the House of Worship, a monument to the days of Dona Mihst; and the impressive Hall of Meeting, the seat of the Council of Faltha. Crime, both petty and organised, flourishes in Instruere; in a notable instance of corruption, the organised criminal groups pay a portion of their takings to the Council. Previously, Instruere had its own mayor, and there was also a time when the King of Straux had his capital in the city. Now, however, city government is vested in the Council of Faltha, and especially in whoever leads the Council for the time being.  Firanes  Firanes, \\"the Cape of Fire\\" in the ancient language of the First Men, is a mountainous country in the north- western extremity of Faltha. The capital and largest town, Rammr, is located on the south coast of the country. After the recent death of King Prosala, the courtier Wisula is acting as regent on behalf of an under-age King whose name is not revealed. Both Wisula and the Arkhos of Firanes are identified by Mahnum as traitors to Faltha. Much of the population lives in southern Firanes, with its warmer climate, and to a lesser extent up the west coast. Legends tell of the ancient city of Astora, once the capital of Firanes, which was built on the west coast and collapsed into the sea after being undermined by erosion. After the drowning of Astora, Loulea, the setting of the opening chapters, is the westernmost village on the Westway, the old highway from Instruere to Astora. Northern Firanes in particular is sparsely populated, and the country as a whole is referred to by Saraskar, an Arkhos of Sarista, as \\"the most...undeveloped\\" of the Sixteen Kingdoms. Travel and communications are very limited, and matters are often dealt with by local communities. Thus, a generations-old feud between the northern towns of Mjolkbridge and Windrise has continued unchecked and produced the occasional battle. The Lankangas, ten cities in eastern Firanes, are currently at war with the government in Rammr, having seceded eight years ago. The most hostile regions of the interior are not subject to the King of Firanes at all; the losian Scymrians have a 300-year truce with Firanes, and the moors of Myrvidda are inhabited only by the Fenni. The extreme north of the country is a region of tundra and frozen seas. Notable geographic features of Firanes include two large rivers, the Mjolk and the Kljufa, and the Jawbone Mountains. The most spectacular range in the Jawbones is the Grossbergen. Also found in these parts is the glacier Styggesbreen.

W. Hornung, and features the gentleman thief A. J. Raffles, and his companion and biographer, Bunny Manders. The story was first published in October 1898 by Cassell's Magazine.Rowland, page 283. The story was also included as the eight and last story in the collection The Amateur Cracksman, published by Methuen & Co. Ltd in London, and Charles Scribner's Sons in New York, both in 1899.Rowland, page 280. The events in the story lead to the eventual exposure of Raffles as a thief and contribute significantly to his cynicism about British High Society. Plot Part one Bunny is struggling to earn an honest living as a journalist. He writes an article about a priceless pearl to be given by a European emperor to Queen Victoria. While boating with Raffles on the Thames, Raffles invites Bunny on a sea voyage for Italy. Later, when Bunny boards their ship at Southampton, however, he discovers Raffles talking to a lady, Miss Werner. In private, Raffles tells Bunny of his plan to steal the emperor's pearl from a German officer, Captain von Heumann, on the ship. Raffles fears that Bunny has turned too honest, but Bunny confesses that honest living has failed him. Part two Bunny is jealous of the attention Raffles pays daily to Miss Werner. Meanwhile, Raffles insists that he and Bunny share one particular cabin. One afternoon, Raffles reveals his plan to Bunny. With Bunny's help, Raffles will climb through the vent in their room's wall, which leads to von Heumann's cabin. The exact location of the pearl was told to him by Miss Werner, who learned it from von Heumann, who is a rival for her affections. Raffles's true feelings about Miss Werner remain ambiguous. Part three Very early morning, Raffles squeezes through the vent, chloroforms the sleeping von Heumann, and takes the pearl. Bunny wants to disembark immediately with the pearl; Raffles insists they stay. Later that day, Inspector Mackenzie boards the ship. Soon after, Raffles and Bunny are summoned by the captain, the chief officer, Mackenzie, and von Heumann. Not only has Mackenzie seen through Raffles's vent trick, but he also presents his warrant to arrest Raffles for past burglaries. Defeated, Raffles confesses that the pearl is hidden in one of his revolver's cartridges. Raffles pleads to be allowed to say good-bye to Miss Werner, whom he has asked to marry. He hastily begs Bunny's forgiveness, then goes to talk to Miss Werner. In doing so, however, Raffles dives into the water, escaping. Ultimately, Bunny is imprisoned and ruined. Raffles's fate remains uncertain. Adaptations Television The story was adapted for the 1977 Raffles television series, though the plot was changed significantly. An envoy of the German Emperor Wilhelm II arrives in London, on his way to the South Sea. He is carrying a precious pearl which he is due to present as a gift to a local King. This is regarded with horror in London, by those who regard it as a German attempt to interfere in a British sphere of influence. Eager to avert this potentially embarrassing situation, a Foreign Office official approaches Gentleman thief A. J. Raffles to steal it back from him while he is in England, staying at a country house. Raffles agrees provided he is permitted to keep the pearl, valued at an estimated ¬£100,000. He travels out to stay at the house with his companion Bunny Manders and waits for a chance to steal the pearl. He is assisted by Inspector Mackenzie, his long-term rival, who has been ordered by his superiors to aid Raffles. Shunning his help, Raffles successfully manages to steal the pearl by climbing down a chimney and evades an attempt by the Germans to recover it. Raffles ultimately is betrayed by the foreign office official who has Raffles has arrested for the theft, and the pearls are sent back to Germany in exchange for an agreement that they will not be given to the Pacific King. The story ends with Raffles not being exposed as a criminal to the public. He continues to live as a member of High Society. Radio BBC Radio adapted the story into the twelfth episode of its Raffles radio drama, \\"A Gift of the Emperor\\", which first aired on 6 July 1988. The drama features Jeremy Clyde as Raffles and Michael Cochrane as Bunny. The plot follows that of the original story with some minor changes: * Bunny begins the episode by quoting the first line written by Dr. John Watson from \\"The Final Problem\\", the short story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle which features the apparent demise of Sherlock Holmes. The line is, \\"It is with a heavy heart that I take up my pen to write these the last words in which I shall ever record the singular gifts by which my friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes was distinguished.\\" Bunny only replaces the words \\"Mr. Sherlock Holmes\\" with \\"A. J. Raffles\\". * Bunny begins very financially well-off in the episode. * Unlike the original story's ladylike Miss Werner, Miss Werner is obnoxious and unlikeable in the drama. Raffles makes it clear that he is only using her. * In the original story, Raffles strips all of his clothes before entering the vent. In the drama, he reluctantly keeps his clothes on, in case of any sudden need to be dressed. * In the drama, Raffles tries to bargain away the pearl to Inspector Mackenzie, in exchange for Bunny's release. Failing that, he then threatens to destroy the pearl, to no avail. * In the original story, Raffles bids Bunny to keep the mate away so that Raffles can escape. In the drama, Raffles instead creates a distraction by pushing Miss Werner overboard.

There are similar creatures in the mythologies of other European cultures, such as the \\"gnome,\\" \\"sylph,\\" and the \\"kobold.\\" The origin of this mythological creature is Celtic, thought to have come to Spain via the Romans and comes from Northern Europe. Portuguese Mythology Trasgu or Trasgo (in Galician and Portuguese) is very common in the folklore of Tras- os-Montes and it was taken by the Portuguese throughout their empire originating similar myths like the Saci in Brazil. Asturian Mythology The trasgu is the best known being of Asturian mythology, and is shared with mythologies of Celtic origin, like Galicia's. It is a domestic goblin with a mischievous and nervous character. It is often represented as a tiny man who limps with his right leg; he has dark skin, wears red clothes and a pointy red hat. He has a hole in his left hand. He is described at times as having horns, tail, sheep ears and long legs, and wearing a long black and gray cloak; at other times he is described as small, with long thin legs and wearing a tight dark brown dress.El gran libro de la mitolog√≠a asturiana, Xuan Xos√© S√°nchez Vicente and Xes√∫s Ca√±edo Valle, Ediciones Trabe, 2003, p. 111-112. Nocturnal noises are attributed to him, and also small pranks like changing the location of objects. He enters homes at night when the inhabitants are asleep. If he is in a bad mood he breaks kitchen vessels, spooks cattle, stirs chests of clothes and spills water. These activities do not cause material damage, because the inhabitants find everything as they left it. On the other hand, when he is treated well, he does house chores during the night. In Asturias, the trasgu is known by different names depending on the location. He is known as Trasno, Corn√≠n or Xuan Dos Cam√≠os in western Asturias. He is known as Gorret√≠n Color√°u or the one with the \\"gorra encarnada\\" (both meaning \\"little red hat\\") in eastern Asturias.Mitos y leyendas de Asturias How to Get Rid of Him It is difficult to get rid of him when he annoys. If the house inhabitants decide to move to a new house, he follows them. In a tale, the inhabitants of a house abandon it because of the trasgu. On their way to the new house, the woman asks her husband: \\"Have we left anything?\\" The trasgu, following them, answers: \\"You have left the lamp, but I'm carrying it.\\" El gran libro de la mitolog√≠a asturiana, Xuan Xos√© S√°nchez Vicente and Xes√∫s Ca√±edo Valle, Ediciones Trabe, 2003, p. 114. In order to expel a trasgu it is necessary to request of him an impossible task, like bringing a basket of water from the sea, picking up millet from the floor (it falls through the hole in his hand), and whitening a black sheep. Because he thinks himself capable of doing everything, he accepts the challenge. In his stubbornness, he will try until he becomes exhausted. When he fails to accomplish the tasks, his pride is hurt. He leaves and does not return. He will also become spooked if someone falsely recreates actions proper of goblins. Cantabrian Mythology In Cantabria, the trasgu is a small goblin with black face and green eyes that inhabits forests. His main activity is to mock people and carry out pranks, especially against girls who are engaged in a specific activity, like shepherding. Because he must hide from humans, his clothes are made of tree leaves and moss. Presence in Literature Trasgu's pranks are told with variations in numerous towns of the Iberian peninsula, and his adventures are evoked in classical works of Spanish literature, like the anonymous 1554 novella Lazarillo de Tormes, the short farces of Miguel de Cervantes and the comedies of Lope de Vega.Mitos y leyendas de Asturias In instances of fantasy literature, and many times in sword and sorcery literature, the term \\"trasgo\\" may be confused with \\"orc\\", when it more generally is used to translate the English term \\"goblin\\" (and vice versa from Spanish to English). For example, the Spanish translation of the novel The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien uses the term \\"trasgo\\" to signify the \\"goblins\\". However, in the Spanish translation of The Lord of the Rings, the orcs are referred to by the term \\"orcos\\". Brazilian translation of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter novel series uses the word \\"trasgo\\" to refer to the creatures known in English editions as trolls.Harry Potter e a Pedra Filosofal, J. K. Rowling, trad.

Along with Trypes, they are considered to be the most popular band in Greece, which became very popular in the 90's. Their music combines elements from pop, rock and electronic music, maintaining a Greek melodic \\"colour\\" at the same time. The personal and experimental lyrics of Pavlos Pavlidis are distinguished for their poetry and the pictures that they give. Generally the band's songs develop an emotional atmosphere, that is sometimes expressed with extroversion and bold rhythms and else with a calm innerness. From 1993 until their break- up, in 2003, the band released 5 albums (4 studio, 1 live) and 1 CD single. Although they had a big commercial success from early on, the group avoided media exposure and maintained their artistic autonomy, seeking to develop their sound from album to album and during their live performances, where they used to experiment and improvise with their songs. The original line-up of the group consisted of: Pavlos Pavlidis (vocals, guitar), Vasilis Gountaroulis (keyboards, samplers), Christos Tsaprazis (bass) and Panos Tolios (drums, percussion 1993-1997). Members of the band had also been: Stavros Rossopoulos (guitar 1993-1994), Takis Kanellos (drums 1997), Giannis Mitsis (drums 1998-2003), Kostas Pantelis (guitar 2000-2003) and Nikos Kyriakopoulos (percussion, backing vocals 2001-2003). Session musicians that appeared in the band's albums are: Dimos Gountaroulis (cello), Giorgos Tolios (percussion), Giorgos Papazoglou (percussion), Rita Hatzinikoli (percussion), Fotis Siotas (violin) and Aristeidis Hatzistavrou (classical guitar). Xylina Spathia are one of the best-selling Greek bands, along with Pyx Lax and Trypes.  History  In 1989, after his participation in the Greek rock band Mora sti Fotia (Greek: ŒúœâœÅŒ¨ œÉœÑŒ∑ Œ¶œâœÑŒπŒ¨, English: Babies on Fire), Pavlos Pavlidis travelled to France and stayed with Nikos Kantaris in M√©riel, a commune near Paris. They created the Brancaleone studio and Pavlidis recorded the first demos of his songs. The first two albums of the band were dedicated to Nikos Kantaris. While in Paris, Pavlidis also met Giannis Mitsis, who became a band member in 1998. In 1992, Pavlidis returned to Thessaloniki and along with Vasilis Gountaroulis, Christos Tsaprazis, Panos Tolios and Stavros Rossopoulos started to work on the material that he had prepared during his stay in France. With this line-up they appeared live, for the first time, in Karditsa under the name \\"Brancaleone\\". They later changed their name to \\"Xylina Spathia\\" from the homonymous novel by Pantelis Kaliotsos. In 1993, the band's first album, \\"Xessaloniki\\" was released by Ano Kato Records. The album contained 12 songs which were recorded from September to October 1993 in Magnanimous studio, owned by Giorgos Pentzikis in Thessaloniki. Christos Harbilas was the sound engineer. Two of the songs (\\"To nero pou kylaei\\" and \\"Poulia 2\\") were recorded in Brancaleone studio in 1992. The album contained well-known songs such as \\"Adrenalini\\", \\"Treno fantasma\\", \\"Rodes\\", \\"Siopi\\" and the hit \\"O vasilias tis skonis\\", which became very popular and is considered as a classic Greek rock song. A review of the album by the mic.gr website in 2005 stated: \\"Xessaloniki is something much more than what phenomenally was back in 1993: a new stream for Greek rock...\\". In 1994, the band appeared live in cities throughout Greece. Their songs were played on the radio, while their public reception was positive and their fans were steadily increasing. During this period Stavros Rossopoulos left the band, without being replaced by another guitarist. In 1995, the band's second album, \\"Pera apo tis poleis tis asfaltou\\" was released by Virgin Records. The album contains 10 songs which were recorded from September to November 1994 in Magnanimous studio. Some of the songs that appear in the album are \\"Rita\\", \\"Oti thes esy\\", \\"Fotia sto limani\\", \\"Atlantis\\" and \\"Liomeno pagoto\\", which is the group's biggest commercial success. Because of some legal problems that the band had with their previous label, the album was withdrawn for a short time, but the group was vindicated and the album returned on sale. Dionysis Savvopoulos also testified on the trial. Sales and radio broadcasts exceed by far the expectations of the band and Pavlos Pavlidis stated: \\"People help you go higher, if you have to go somewhere...\\". In 1996, \\"Pera apo tis poleis tis asfaltou\\" became gold. The band gave concerts throughout Greece and gained a wide audience. \\"Liomeno pagoto\\" and \\"Fotia sto limani\\" became the super hits among youngsters. In 1997, the band's third album, \\"Mia matia san vrohi\\" was released by Virgin Records. It contained 10 songs which were recorded from January to April 1997 in Magnanimous studio. The album's hits were \\"Vrohopoios\\", \\"Den ehei telos\\", \\"Ena paraxeno tragoudi\\", \\"Sto vraho\\", \\"Allazei prosopa I thlipsi\\" and the explosive song \\"Robot\\". \\"Mia matia san vrohi\\" was the group's finest album and probably their most important (artistic) release. With this release the band made clear their intention to experiment in more electronic sound paths and Vasilis Gountaroulis played the leading role in the band's composition, in which all the members took part. In an interview, in 1997, Pavlos stated: \\"What was of my interest from the beginning, was a band that given the success, would go further. When we met together with the guys, I saw that we were a good group with unpredictable development. Now, in the third disc material, the work is total and the ideas jump out from everywhere.\\". During the same year the band continued their concerts in Greece and Cyprus, with the climax event of Vyronas Festival, where a record of 8,000 people was gathered. In the fall of the year, after an invitation from MTV, they appeared in H.Q. club in London. This was their first appearance without Panos Tolios, who left the band and was replaced by Takis Kanellos of Mode Plagal. In 1998, \\"Pera apo tis poleis tis asfaltou\\" became platinum and \\"Mia matia san vrohi\\" became gold. Their appearances in Rodon (Athens) and Mylos, Thessaloniki were sold out. In July they appeared in Rockwave Festival '98 and in September they opened the Rolling Stones concert in Athens. Pavlos Pavlidis stated: \\"The idea of singing in front of 80,000 people is crazy. When we finished, the Stones manager told me: \\"You are among the few bands that escaped the bottles. In our tours we have a special staff to clean the stage from bottles thrown to support groups. Today the staff will rest. \\"When I asked him which bands had also escaped the bottles he told me: \\"Some of the bands I can recall are the Smashing Pumpkins and Red Hot Chili Peppers. By the fall of the year, the band revisited Great Britain and appeared in Hacienda Manchester. Takis Kanellos could not follow the band's full schedule and gave his place to Giannis Mitsis. In 1999, the EP \\"Trofi gia ta thiria\\" was released by Virgin Records. It contained 4 songs, which were recorded from April to May 1999 in Agrotikon studio owned by Nikos Papazoglou in Thessaloniki. These songs were indicative of the band's double sound direction. On one hand, calm and atmospherical compositions (\\"Diastimoploia\\" and \\"Hathika\\") and on the other hand, explosive dancing rhythms and electronic sounds (\\"Trofi gia ta thiria\\" and \\"Tora arhizo kai thymamai\\"). In fact, this single was the precursor of their next and final studio album that would be released a year later. In the meantime, the band continued their live appearances with success. Kostas Pantelis also joined the band. In 2000, the band's fourth and last studio album, \\"Enas kyklos ston aera\\" was released by Virgin Records. The album contained 10 songs, which were recorded from May to June 2000 in Magnanimous studio, with Christos Megas and Martin Ekman as sound engineers.The most recognisable songs of the album are \\"I teleutaia fora\\", \\"Ti perimenoun\\", \\"O navagos\\", \\"San esena\\", \\"Hartinos ouranos\\" and \\"Pare me mazi sou\\", the band's last hit.Earlier that winter, Pavlos Pavlidis went to Amorgos, where he created most of the songs that appeared in the album, in the home studio that he had created.\\"Enas kyklos ston aera\\" was probably the most divided (creatively) album of the band, as the contradictory musical directions that had been followed in the previous album, were becoming clearer. As a result, strong and dancing songs such as \\"Ti perimenoun\\", coexisted with slow, almost whispering compositions such as \\"O navagos\\".Despite these minor problems, the band seemed that it was crossing its most mature period, testifying an album that did not probably had the integrity and the exuberance of \\"Mia matia san vrohi\\" or the momentum of \\"Xessaloniki\\", but could be maintained on a high level and was the product of an all that had worked with its sound all those years and, closing its career, was still creative and unpredictable. During the following years (2001‚Äì2002), the band continued its successful concerts throughout Greece playing new songs, while a sixth member, Nikos Kyriakopoulos, who played the percussion and sung the backing vocals, joined the line-up. The climate seemed to be positive and a new creative period seemed to have opened. Despite the new plans of the group, the break-up was near. In 2003, the band's \\"Live\\" album was released by Virgin Records. The album contained 16 songs, which were presented live in concerts that were played from February to November 2001 and were recorded by the mobile recording unit of Polytropon and Octal One studios, with Christos Megas, Makis Pelopidas, Kostas Vamvoukas, Argyris Papageorgiou, Giorgos Kazantzis and Vagelis Kalaras as sound engineers.All of the songs came from previous works of the group except for a new one, \\"Grand Hotel\\". At the end of the song, Pavlidis can be heard saying: 'Thank you...This is the first time we are playing it...\\". \\"Live\\" was an album that attempted to record the explosive climate that was prevailing during the band's concerts and confirm the group's reputation as a dynamic live band. In this album were also recorded the improvisational feeling and the evolution of the band's sound all those years.This could be seen on the songs from their two first albums, which are almost unrecognisable. It should also be mentioned that the album does not contain the group's big hits, something that intentionally happened, in order to view songs that the band loved, but had lived in the shadow of the big commercial successes. Especially, \\"Liomeno pagoto\\" was thought to be an overplayed song. \\"Live\\" was the band's valedictory album and was dedicated \\"to those who were with us all those nights...\\". By the fall of 2003, Xylina Spathia broke up and the band members followed different musical directions. Their work continues to be recognised and along with Pavlos Sidiropoulos and Trypes, they are considered to be among the artists who defined Greek rock. In 2005, two years after the group's break-up, \\"The Best Of\\" was released by Virgin Records. It contained 16 songs from the group's previous works and a bonus track by Viton & Stel, entitled \\"Wooden Swordz\\". There was no contribution by any of the band's members in the release of the album.

The Polytene Chromosomes of Cnesia dissimilis (Edwards) and Three Species of Gigantodax Enderlein (Diptera: Simuliidae) from Lanin National Park (Argentina) by Cecilia L Coscaron Arias Clemson University Department of Entomology, Soils, & Plant Sciences The taxonomy of the genus was revised in 1989 by an academic paper published in the bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History. In 1997, researchers from the Universidad Nacional del Comahue in Rio Negro, Argentina collected larvae of G. marginalis and other fly species in Lanin National Park, Neuqu√©n Province. After a close examination included chromosome mapping, they reported: > Females are not anthropophilic and can be found as well as in mountain > creeks from sea level to 4,700 m of altitude (Wygodzinsky & Coscaron 1989). > Gigantodax is a peculiar genus, showing the greatest diversity among the > Prosimuliini genera, with synapomorphies in imago and preimaginal stages > that help to differentiate species in this genus from other genera. The > unusual morphology of the respiratory filaments in the pupal stage is useful > in differentiating species. These South American researchers also analyzed G. marginalis, G. fulvescens, and G. chilensis and reported that Cnesia, another Prosimuliini genus, is sympatric with southern populations of Gigantodax and that both genera breed on both sides of the Andean range in Argentina and Chile in subantarctic Patagonia. They also reported that Gigantodax species in this area are also sympatric with Simulium. These genus was re-examined in 2007 by entomologits from the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro in Brazil who explained that in their paper: > ...the first phylogenetic hypothesis for the 13 Southern Hemisphere genera > of Simuliidae is proposed, through a cladistic approach. In order to > investigate the position of those genera representatives of five Northern > Hemisphere genera were also included in the analyses as outgroups. The study > was based on a data matrix with 33 terminal taxa and 119 morphological > characters of adult, pupa and larva.

EBMUD engineers had to quickly redesign the project, first by reducing the reservoir capacity to one-third of its original design. Then they delayed further construction by three years, to see whether more settling would occur. The design change was apparently satisfactory, and the dam was completed in 1933. An observation tower built at the southwestern corner of the lake was left unchanged when the dam was redesigned. Thus, the tower seems too tall for its intended use. The top is accessible only by scaling metal rungs embedded in its side. Therefore, the tiny observation booth is almost always deserted, and the antique doors have turned green from oxidation. During 1935, the Soil Conservation Service (SCS), a Federal New Deal program, started planting 5,000 Monterey pine seedlings at San Pablo Reservoir, many of which were to be used for soil stabilization on slopes around Lafayette and other EBMU reservoirs. By 1940, the program had planted about 57,000 trees around all of EBMUD's reservoirs. After 80 years, the Monterey pines are close to the end of their life cycle, and some are being removed under a thinning program.\\"Lafayette Reservoir Erosion Control.\\" The Living New Deal.

This utilitarian wood frame rowhouse was built c. 1885-90 by Warren Rawson, a leading farmer in Arlington, to house farm workers. It is one of only a few such multiunit buildings to survive in the town. The rowhouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The Warren Rawson rowhouse is set on the east side of Park Street in eastern Arlington, in what is now a densely-built residential area. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with seven essentially identical units in a row. Each unit features plainly-decorated doors, windows, and a gabled dormer at the attic level. Warren Rawson was a leading farmer operating in eastern Arlington in the late 19th century, when garden farming was a major economic activity in the town. This rowhouse is one of two surviving worker housing units he built to house the workers in his farming operations (the other is the Warren Rawson Building on Franklin Street), and are believed to be unique to Arlington. Rawson is documented as having employed as many as 65 workers in his extensive operation, which included the innovative use of steam-heated greenhouses and electric arc lighting. His operations extended from Warren Street to the Mystic River.

History When Lukather's record company, Bop City Records, approached him about recording a Christmas album, he quipped, \\"Why me? Do I look like Father Christmas to you mofos?\\" The company wanted him to do the record knowing he would approach the project with a unique angle and produce something different from the typical Christmas album. Lukather recruited keyboardist Jeff Babko and guitarist Larry Carlton, who Lukather had worked with previously, to help arrange the songs. The result was a challenge to Lukather, who had to be creative to turn the traditionally simple songs into something interesting for listeners. The musicians Lukather chose for Santamental, most of whom are hard rock veterans, lent a heavy feel to the album. Van Halen recorded guitar tracks for \\"Joy to the World\\" after not having been in the studio for some time but immediately made an impression on Lukather with his level of playing.

Adept street-fighter.  Cast  * Rakhi Sawant as Celina Plot Om has been banished from Mumbai for a period of 2 years. Shortly after the beginning of these two years, Mr. Dhariwal goes to Om's mother and begs that she call Om back to Mumbai. The reason he needs Om is because his daughter Sandali has been kidnapped by Ghotia Bhai, Dhariwal's associate. Ghotia Bhai wishes for Sandali to marry his son, Brandy. However, Dhariwal and Sandali do not want this so Om comes back to rescue the girl he cares for. When Om arrives in the city, he is able to free Sandali and disposes of Brandy in the process. Inspector Nasir Pathan is the new chief of police in the district and since Om is not supposed to be back for 2 years, pursues him. He catches Om, arrests and puts him into jail and returns Sandali to her father. Upon further investigation though, Nasir Pathan uncovers an evil conspiracy against Om and his family. Not only had Om been unfairly banished for 2 years, his sister had also been murdered by Inspector Katkar. Om and Sandali had fallen in love when they met a few months before. However, Mr. Dhariwal didn't want this marriage because in his wife's will, the boy that Sandali marries will get her wealth and Dhariwal would be left penniless. The reason she had stipulated this is because she did not trust her husband's ability to control his gambling and habit of vice. Dhariwal murdered his wife but no one found out. So he waited for years until Sandali grew up and he started looking for a boy he could manipulate into giving him half of his daughter's endowment. He asks Om to share the money with him upon his marriage to Sandali but the former refuses. This alarms Dhariwal so he turns to Inspector Katkar and along with Dhariwal's new wife, the cunning Celina, they both hatch an evil plan to ruin Om's name in the city, thereby making it difficult for Sandali to marry him. Katkar arranges for Darren, Celina's secret paramour, to go to Om's house and act as if his younger sister was a prostitute and Darren was frequenting the house for this purpose. Om's sister is taken to jail and killed but Katkar disguises it as a suicide. Om gets to know of their plan to ruin his family's name (but not his sister's murder) and confronts Dhariwal, Darren and Katkar. Because he attacks Katkar, the inspector is able to exile Om for 2 years from Mumbai as a dangerous criminal. When Sandali is returned to her father after Om rescues her, he is furious to find out that Om and she have consummated their marriage by exchanging vows. He quickly ignores this and wants her to marry Darren. However, before this can happen Celina divulges that Darren is her secret lover and she was simply using Dhariwal for his money. Dhariwal is incensed and shot to death by Celina with no remorse. Darren then disposes of Celina and prepares to marry Sandali so he can control all her wealth. Om breaks out of jail where, after a thorough investigation, Inspector Nasir Pathan has just realised the truth about the conspiracy against him. Om also finds out that Katkar had killed his sister and confronts him. After a furious struggle, Om kills him. He then sets off to rescue Sandali from Darren, with Inspector Pathan in hot pursuit as well. Darren and Om have a long and intense fight but Om perseveres. He and Sandali then set off to marry, with Inspector Pathan watching and knowing that Om has been vindicated.

The context is usually the security alliances of the United States with Japan, South Korea, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (much of Europe, Turkey, Canada), and Australia, originating with the Cold War with the Soviet Union. For some countries, it was an alternative to acquiring nuclear weapons themselves; other alternatives include regional nuclear- weapon-free zones or nuclear sharing. NATO NATO was formed early in the Cold War and, from the beginning, assumed American nuclear power as a major component of defense of Western Europe from possible Soviet invasion. Most non-Communist European states joined the alliance, although some (Ireland, Switzerland, Austria, Sweden, Finland) instead maintained an official policy of neutrality. Sweden and Switzerland considered developing their own nuclear weapons but abandoned the idea. NATO involved others of the five official nuclear weapons states. The United Kingdom and Canada participated in the initial American development of the atomic bomb (Manhattan Project) during World War II, but were afterwards excluded from nuclear weapons secrets by act of the US Congress. Britain launched an independent nuclear weapons program; after Britain successfully developed thermonuclear weapons, the US and UK signed the 1958 US‚ÄìUK Mutual Defence Agreement sharing American weapons designs, eliminating the need for independent development. France developed a nuclear force de frappe and left the NATO command structure while continuing to be allied with the other Western countries. NATO nuclear Sharing was conceived to prevent further independent proliferation among the western allies. France later rejoined the NATO joint military command on April 4th, 2009. After the end of the Cold War, many Central and Eastern European countries joined NATO, although the original purpose of defense against the Soviet Union was by then obsolete. Some commentators opposed this NATO enlargement as unnecessarily provocative to Russia. ANZUS As late as 1970, Australia considered embarking on nuclear weapons development but finally agreed to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Since then Australia has been a proponent of nuclear disarmament. Japan The Japanese nuclear weapon program was conducted during World War II. Like the German nuclear weapons program, it suffered from an array of problems, and was ultimately unable to progress beyond the laboratory stage. Following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, World War II and the deconstruction of the imperial military, Japan came under the US \\"nuclear umbrella\\" on the condition that it will not produce nuclear weapons. This was formalized in the Security Treaty Between the United States and Japan, which preceded the current security alliance, the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan. Japan and the United States also have a major missile defense accord to mitigate the North Korean nuclear threat, among others and have deployed the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System jointly. Warsaw Pact (former) Like NATO, the members of the Warsaw Pact were protected by nuclear weapons of the Soviet Union with the weapons being deployed either in Soviet territory or closer to NATO in territory of the other member states, particularly Poland (see Poland and weapons of mass destruction). Unlike NATO however there was no nuclear sharing and all weapons remained completely under Soviet control. At least one member of the Warsaw Pact, Romania, did consider developing its own arsenal but later abandoned it (see Romania and weapons of mass destruction). Most Eastern European Communist states were part of the Warsaw Pact with the exception of Yugoslavia which became neutral especially after the Tito‚ÄìStalin Split, and Albania later left the alliance after the Soviet‚ÄìAlbanian split and aligned itself with the People's Republic of China which had also cut ties with the Soviets in the Sino-Soviet split. Soviet Allies outside of the Warsaw Pact It is unclear if and to what extent the Soviet Union's nuclear umbrella covered other allied communist and non communist states outside of the Warsaw Pact at one time or another besides China prior to the Sino-Soviet Split (see China and weapons of mass destruction) and Cuba (see the Cuban Missile Crisis). Russian nuclear umbrella The term is far less used for Russian nuclear guarantees, but is seen occasionally. * Unspecified countries *Ukraine, requested * Kazakhstan * Commonwealth of Independent States Missile defense Missile defense would provide an \\"umbrella\\" of another kind against nuclear attack.

Crash Boat is halfway between the Ramey Air Force Base and Aguadilla and still retains some remains of its pier infrastructure from when it was used to rescue downed air crews from Ramey Air Force Base. These pier remains are used as a fishing spot and for jumping into the waters. Crash Boat also has two large sand beach areas for general bathing. The beach is primarily accessed by taking PR-107 to a spur signed, PR-458. Getting There The closest passenger airport to Crash Boat is Rafael Hern√°ndez Airport(BQN), located 4 miles(6 km) away. From Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n International Airport(SJU) in Carolina, it takes about 1 hour & 30 minutes (85 miles) to get to this beach. The easiest way is using the Highway PR-22/Expreso Jose de Diego towards the west for about 52 miles. Then stay straight to go onto PR-2 Highway for about 26 miles until you reach PR-107 which will be on your right. Once in PR-107 drive for about 1.2 miles when you will reach PR-458 on your left. PR-458 will take you directly towards Crash Boat Parking as it is a dead end road. There is public parking and the beach is easy to find. What can be done *Swimming areas designated with buoys. Also some swimmers jump off the pier which is safe. Still, beware of low tides that may change water depth in order to prevent injuries. *Sun Bathing: Excellent conditions year round but beware of the tropical sun as exposure without proper sunblock may create uncomfortable situations such as sunburns and moderate to extreme itching when healing. *Surfing: Good for all surfing levels. The beach is known for being a surfing and body-boarding spot even though it is not an extremely consistent surf spot compared to the surrounding area. It requires a large swell to wrap around into the Aguadilla Bay area. On good surf days the crowds may be huge. Breaks best on west or northwest swell, with any wind. *Scuba and Snorkeling: There are many fish around the pier pillars with average depths of 30 feet. It has low currents (1 knot) and has good visibility (10‚Äì30 meters) which make it ideal for all divers. *Paddle boarding: this activity which has grown in recent years can be practiced here. There are rental stands where the proper equipment can be leased. *Jet skiing and other motor boats: May be rented for use. *Sand: Many palm trees for shade while playing with the sand. *Sunset: as Aguadilla is on the west side of Puerto Rico, sunsets can be seen from the beach. *Walking: the beach is surrounded by mountains that offer a view of the shoreline and vegetation which can be explored using available walking trails. *Shells: The beach has Mediterranean-style seashells which are sometimes collected by visitors. Name Origin How the beach became known as \\"Crash boat\\" is not clear. There are some hypothesis about this. One is that the beach got its name from a large boat that crashed into the cement pier before turning south and sink on the beach. The other hypothesis relates to the use of the beach by the US military during World War II, with the dock being built to accommodate the Crash Rescue Boats Squadron, with the beach referred to as Crash boat. This \\"Crash Rescue Boats Squadron\\" from the United States Air Force used to keep rescue boats here to pick up crews from the Air Force flying boats and other aircraft that were disabled at sea and couldn't make the runway at nearby Ramey Air Force Base.\\" The Crash Boat Beach pier / dock was originally built with fuel pipe that pumped aircraft grade fuel for Ramey Air Force Base. As time passed, local currents dropped tons of sand into the beach and pier area, making it unusable to dock a boat at the pier.

It is built on land that was held in the Symmes family since 1703, when it was purchased from a Native American. Although it has been claimed to date to 1746, the house was probably built in 1841, and may incorporate parts of an older building within it. The building is one of the finest examples of Greek Revival architecture in Arlington, with a pillared porch on two sides. The house is notable for its association with Stephen Symmes Jr., who bequeathed this property to the town for use as a hospital. Symmes Hospital The location of the house on Crosby Street was deemed unsuitable for use as a hospital, and the town was granted permission by the probate court to liquidate the estate and use the proceeds to build a hospital elsewhere. This resulted in the construction of Symmes Hospital in Arlington. Symmes Hospital served Arlington from 1901 to 1999, then stood vacant for several years until finally being torn down in 2008. Finally in 2013‚Äì2014, the hospital site was redeveloped as the Arlington 360 residences. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

The camp, which was originally designed to hold 3,500 people, opened in December 1943 and was officially closed on February 11, 1948.Friedman, Max Paul, \\"Nazis and Good Neighbors: The United States Campaign against the Germans of Latin America in World War II\\" (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2003) Officially known as the Crystal City Alien Enemy Detention Facility (more commonly referred to as U.S. Family Internment Camp, Crystal City, Texas), the camp was operated by the Immigration and Naturalization Service under the Department of Justice and was originally designed to hold Japanese families, but later held German families, as well, including many who were deported from Latin American countries to the U.S.Mak, Stephen. \\"Crystal City,\\" Densho Encyclopedia (accessed 28 Apr 2014). A significant number of those incarcerated were native-born American citizens.Riley, Karen, \\"Schools Behind Barbed Wire\\" (Lanham, Md.: Rowman & Littlefield, 2002) The Crystal City Internment Camp was one of the primary confinement facilities in the United States for families during World War II. The detention camps were described at the time as an \\"internal security\\" measure, but are now considered to have been \\"unjust and motivated by racism rather than real military necessity\\", as reported by the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians. The camp held 3,374 detainees on December 29, 1944. This was the maximum it ever held. Establishment of camp Crystal City, named after the town it neighbors and located south of San Antonio, was one of the largest camps in Texas. Before the war, it had been a migrant labor camp, built by the Farm Security Administration to house an influx of migrant workers who came to farm the area's most profitable crop, spinach. At the start of World War II, thousands of Japanese and German residents of the U.S., including both U.S. citizens and resident aliens, were arrested and separated from their families during their initial detention. The FSA camp was turned over to the INS to allow these so-called \\"enemy aliens\\" to be reunited with their wives and children, and the first group of 35 German families arrived on December 12, 1942. Women and children from Camp Seagoville, which was opened to house Latin American Japanese and became overcrowded with the addition of domestic Japanese American incarcerees, began arriving in early 1943, and their husbands and fathers were transferred to Crystal City from Camp Kenedy and several War Relocation Authority camps, beginning in June. By August 1944, the camp held 2,104 people of Japanese ancestry (about half from Latin America) and 804 people of German descent, housed separately by ethnicity. The internees Latin Americans Early in the war, in the name of \\"hemispheric security\\", the United States government began negotiations with several Latin American countries to round up and deport German and Japanese nationals who had been living in those countries.Mak, Stephen. \\"Japanese Latin Americans,\\" Densho Encyclopedia (accessed 4 Aug 2014). Upon their arrival in New Orleans, Louisiana, the initial male deportees were arrested on the grounds that they had attempted to enter the country illegally (having been denied visas by immigration authorities) and detained at various INS stations in the region, before being relocated to the internment camps at Kenedy, Texas, and Santa Fe, New Mexico.Gardiner, Harvey C. Pawns in a Triangle of Hate: The Peruvian Japanese and the United States (University of Washington: Seattle, 1981) 25-29. Their wives and children followed them later ‚Äî ostensibly as volunteers, although most families lacked feasible alternatives to deportation. Once incarcerated in the United States, they could then be sent to Germany or Japan in exchange for the return of American citizens and diplomats stranded in Axis nations. The prisoner-exchange program proved to be short-lived, and eventually transitioned into a \\"repatriation\\" program in which German and Japanese nationals and their families (including many children who had never been to their \\"home\\" country) were deported once again to Germany and Japan. The majority of Crystal City's Latin American population was transported to Germany and Japan at the end of the war, although several hundred Japanese Peruvians were allowed to remain in the U.S. after a two-year legal battle.\\"Crystal City (Family) Internment Camp.\\" Texas State Historical Commission. Retrieved 2016-05-26. Of the nearly 1,500 Latin American Japanese confined in Crystal City during the war, almost 80% came from Peru. The 234 Latin American Germans had been deported from Bolivia, Colombia, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Honduras, and Nicaragua, in addition to a few from Haiti. German and Japanese Americans The Crystal City camp also held Japanese and German Americans who previously lived in many different parts of the United States. Noncitizen Japanese and German men were arrested in large numbers immediately after the attack on Pearl Harbor and forcibly incarcerated in various INS, U.S. Army, and Department of Justice detention sites before being transferred to Crystal City, where they were reunited with their families. The first German American incarcerees arrived in December 1942 from Ellis Island and Camp Forrest. The first Japanese Americans were women and children brought to Crystal City from Seagoville in March 1943. Additional Japanese Americans were transported by train from western detention facilities and WRA camps in the following months. Most of the Japanese-American incarcerees were transported from the West Coast, while the German Americans were brought from numerous locations throughout the United States. Internment life Actors and others at Girl Scout dramatic presentation at Hinamatsuri (Doll's Festival) on Japanese Girl's Day on stage at Crystal City Internment Camp, Crystal City, Texas, 1943-45 The idea of family internment was a new concept proposed with regards to the detention of German and Japanese aliens in World War II. In the Crystal City internment camp, German and Japanese internees lived separately from one another and were placed in two different sections of the camp. Crystal City INS officials justified the segregation as a way to monitor both groups. The Crystal City Internment Camp received large numbers of detainees from other internment facilities in the United States and the camp became overpopulated. The camp's German section provided its internees with a German bakery, mess hall, community hall, and cottages. Large German families were given their own cottages that included showers, kitchens, bathrooms, and hot water. A weekly German-language newsletter was published, with the title Unter uns. The Japanese section included a Japanese school, the Federal High School, the Federal Elementary School, a citrus orchard, and several recreational facilities such as tennis courts, basketball courts, a football field, and a swimming pool. The Japanese internees of the camp lived in housing with running water and iceboxes. Children Almost all of the children held at the Crystal City internment camp were native-born American citizens whose parents were alien noncitizens. Each child at the Crystal City Internment Camp received a quart of milk each day. Three schools were established: the German School, the Japanese School, and the American Schools of Federal Elementary and Federal High School. The schools provided the interned students with all of the basic programs that schools in Texas were required to have. Established in January 1943, the American School at the Crystal City Internment Camp educated over 1000 students before being closed in June 1946. Most of the American School's students at Crystal City were Japanese-American internees and a large number of the students were later accepted into various universities in the United States. The parents of German-American students refused to send their children to the American School, preferring education at the German School. The German- American children who transferred into the German School from the American School often struggled in the classroom because they were unable to speak German fluently. The German School and the American Schools had similar enrollments, and each school educated about 350 students. The Japanese School educated about 300 Latin American Japanese and Japanese American students. The Japanese School's curriculum resembled the curriculum students in Japan received, focusing on Japanese morals, ethics, and physical education. School closing On January 24, 1946 Crystal City Internment Camp official J. L. O'Rourke closed the German and Japanese schools and ordered that all remaining students enroll in the American schools. The American schools were then closed on June 28, 1946, but only 16 Japanese students still remained in Crystal City with their parents. The population of the camp was already low because numerous internees were repatriated to their native countries after the war ended. The INS rejected the proposed idea of transferring the Japanese students into public schools near Crystal City. Due to the INS decision and the lack of resources to move elsewhere, the remaining Japanese internees reinstalled the Japanese School. Camp closing In 1945, as the war was coming to an end, delegates to the Mexico City Conference on the Problems of War and Peace declared that a person would be subject to removal from the Western Hemisphere should their remaining in the Americas prove \\"prejudicial\\" to security, and in September, President Harry Truman issued a proclamation that authorized the deportation of enemy aliens in the U.S. \\"without admission under the immigration laws.\\" At the end of the year, the camp still held 3,374 inmates: 2,371 Japanese and 997 Germans, as well as six Italians. By December, 660 Japanese Peruvians (whose country prohibited them from returning) had been transported to Japan and 600 Japanese Hawaiians were returned to their prewar communities. By June 1946, most of the remaining German and Japanese internees, including another 900 Japanese Peruvians, had been deported. Crystal City remained open, however, to house Japanese Peruvians who had refused to participate in the government's repatriation program. With the help of ACLU attorney Wayne M. Collins, 364 internees filed a lawsuit and, after two years, obtained parole to work at Seabrook Farms in New Jersey. The Crystal City Internment camp was officially closed upon their release on February 11, 1948.  Legacy  The site of the camp is now owned by the local school district, and is marked by a granite stone engraved with \\"World War II Concentration Camp, 1943-1946\\", which was installed in November 1985.

The book evolved from a 24-page, self-published version by Derf in 2002.  Publication history  My Friend Dahmer is the culmination of a comic book project first started in 1994, shortly after Jeffrey Dahmer was murdered in prison. Derf's first Dahmer story appeared in Zero Zero #18 (Fantagraphics, July 1997). Derf pitched the project as a 100-page graphic novel, but failed to find a publisher. He then self-published a scaled-back 24-page My Friend Dahmer in 2002. The success that came with the 24-page version (including an Eisner nomination) spurred Derf to create the 224-page version after six years of stalling. Derf felt that he hadn't done the project justice in the 24-page version; the 224-page version was published by Abrams in 2012.  Plot  The novel depicts the author's teenage friendship with Jeffrey Dahmer, who later became a serial killer, during his time at Eastview Junior High and Revere High School. The story follows Dahmer from age 12 up to, but not including, his first murder, two weeks after high school graduation. Backderf, while not excusing or forgiving Dahmer's crimes, presents an empathetic portrait of Dahmer as a lonely young man tormented by inner demons, ridiculed by bullies at school, and neglected by the adults in his life. The graphic novel recalls Dahmer's isolation, his binge drinking, his bizarre behavior to get attention, and his disturbing fascination with roadkill. Derf and his friends encouraged Dahmer to act out, including faking epileptic seizures in school and the mall and pretending to have cerebral palsy., p. 2  Style  One of Derf's techniques was drawing Dahmer in shadow as a representation of his personality.  Adaptations  The original self- published comic book was adapted and staged as a one-act play by the NYU Theater Department. The novel was adapted into a film in 2017, directed by Marc Meyers and starring Ross Lynch as Jeffrey Dahmer. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an 86% rating based on 88 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"My Friend Dahmer opens a window into the making of a serial killer whose conclusions are as empathetic as they are deeply troubling.\\" Metacritic, another review aggregator, assigned the film a weighted average score of 68 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".  Reception and awards  The original self-published comic book was nominated for an Eisner Award. Lev Grossman, book critic of Time magazine, named My Friend Dahmer one of the top five non-fiction books of 2012. The final 224-page version was nominated for an Ignatz Award for Outstanding Graphic Novel.\\"2012 Ignatz Awards\\", spxpo.com/ignatz-awards, archived on the Internet Archive 8 October 2012.

Sprague was a member of a prominent Rhode Island family. His brother William was a United States senator. Six months before his murder, Amasa Sprague had used his family's political influence to have Cranston resident Nicholas Gordon's liquor license removed by the city council. (Sprague's employees were habitually getting drunk at Gordon's premises.) Nicholas Gordon and his brother John were Roman Catholic immigrants from Ireland. Nicholas, John and William Gordon (another brother) were all tried for murder, but only John was convicted, a conviction based on contradictory circumstantial evidence. William was found not guilty and in Nicholas's case, held after John's execution, the jury was hung. John Gordon was executed by hanging in the state jail in Providence.

The houses they built were large and predominantly Colonial Revival in styling, although other popular styles of the period, including Shingle, Craftsman, and Queen Anne, are represented in the surviving houses. McClare's own house at 9 Brantwood Road, built c. 1898, is a fine Queen Anne/Shingle style house with views of the Boston skyline. The Carroll House (101 Brantwood) is the neighborhood's finest example of the Bungalow style; it was built in 1900, and features the low-slung roofline typical of the style, with rustic fieldstone porch piers.

He also often went to events at the Rosemont Horizon. Attending North Park University, Walker graduated with a bachelor of science and a degree in exercise physiology as well as having an athletic career competing in college football, baseball and wrestling. He also competed in amateur bodybuilding during college, winning second place in the 2002 and 2003 Mr. Illinois competition. In 2003, he began training to become a professional wrestler. His trainer Eric Priest was himself trained by independent wrestlers Danny Dominion and Ace Steel. Prior to his debut, he had a brief stint with the National Indoor Football League playing for the Myrtle Beach Stingrays. Following his debut, Walker wrestled throughout the United States both under his real name and as Mike Venom, winning numerous championship titles on the independent circuit as well as facing his boyhood idols The Road Warriors in several tag team matches.

He is noted for his efforts in trying to stem epidemics of exotic infectious diseases such as the Ebola virus, Hanta virus and Rift Valley fever (RVF). He is an eminent authority on the virology, pathogenesis and epidemiology of hemorrhagic fever viruses. Biography Peters grew up in Odessa, Texas. At Rice University, he initially majored in chemical engineering, but switched to chemistry his junior year after taking courses with Thomas Brackett. He obtained his medical degree at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and served his residency in internal medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School. He developed an interest in tropical medicine and virology while serving five years as a research associate at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease intramural laboratory in Panama. Upon returning Stateside, he completed his fellowship in immunology at the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation. He entered active duty in the U.S. Army and from 1977 through 1992 held several positions at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), Fort Detrick, Maryland, where he worked on biodefense and hazardous virus research. His positions there ranged from research scientist and Medical Division chief to Disease Assessment Division chief. He led the team that controlled a 1989 Ebola introduction into a monkey facility in Reston, Virginia (a story recounted in Richard Preston‚Äôs best- selling 1994 book The Hot Zone). From 1992 to 2000 Peters was head of the Special Pathogens Branch at the Centers for Disease Control where he investigated hazardous emerging viruses. These included the agent causing the new disease hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the southwestern US, which he discovered and named. He also led efforts in Africa (Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, Rift Valley fever), Asia (Nipah virus in Malaysia), and South America (Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, Venezuelan equine encephalitis) to control outbreaks. Since 2000, Peters has been the John Sealy Distinguished University Professor of Tropical and Emerging Virology at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston, where he has an active research program in SARS, Rift Valley fever, and other human pathogens. He is a professor in the department of pathology and in the department of microbiology and immunology. He is a member of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Tropical Diseases. He is also director for biodefense at the UTMB Center for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases. Peters has published more than 300 papers on research and control of viral diseases including more than 70 publications on Rift Valley fever virus and more than 60 publications on arenaviruses. He has served on numerous committees dealing with disease problems worldwide and has been called back as a consultant to CDC and USAMRIID on influenza, vaccines, and other issues after his departure. He consulted with Taiwan on SARS control. Current work Most of Peters' current work in the laboratory deals with Bunyaviridae (including the phylogeny of phleboviruses such as Rift Valley fever (RVF), Arenaviridae (Lassa fever, South American hemorrhagic fevers) and SARS CoV. He runs an active program of human and animal vaccine development for RVF using reverse genetics. He and his colleague Ilya Frolov are developing alphavirus replicon vectored RVF vaccines for use in livestock and ultimately in humans. His arenavirus research concentrates on the effects of infection on cellular function, particularly those molecular interactions related to vascular permeability. SARS-CoV work includes antiviral drug development, model characterization, and interferon interactions. The Galveston National Laboratory, a Biosafety Level 4 laboratory, opened in 2008 at the University of Texas Medical Branch to allow scientists there to work safely with any pathologic agent. Peters expects to transition some projects to higher hazard viral hemorrhagic fevers and to develop projects on other viruses such as tick-borne flaviviruses, highly virulent avian influenza strains, and Nipah virus, a new, highly virulent paramyxovirus.

It was originally developed in 1963 at Manly Sailing Club in Sydney as the Manly Graduate 14ft to be used as a stepping stone between the smaller Manly Junior and larger boats such as the 16ft Skiff. During its early history it had a double luff spinnaker, but is now rigged with an asymmetric spinnaker - giving great performance, ease of use and tactical gybing downwind. The MG14 is now a high performance machine, with performance to rival any other single trapeze boat of its size. Keeping the modest sail area, however, has ensured entry level skiff sailors, and older sailors, can still compete and race. It is a performance boat that places emphasis on technique, finesse and strategy - rather than brute force! The class has various hull designs of similar performance, but with variances in stability or speed on certain wind angles and strength. The class has a tight set of rules so the boats can modernise but the older ones still remain competitive for many years. Because of this MG14s have good resale value. It is a popular class with fleets in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and in the Australian Capital Territory. The NS14 class is very similar to the MG14 - it has the same hull and working rig designs but that class does not allow spinnakers or trapezes.

The site preserves a portion of the fortifications and battle area of the longest siege in American history, during the American Civil War from May 23 through July 9, 1863. The state of Louisiana maintains the site, which includes a museum about the siege, artillery displays, redoubts, and interpretive plaques. Living history re- enactments are held each year. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1974, significant as the first place where African-American military units fought for the Union Army under African-American field leadership. Description Port Hudson State Historic Site is located north of the community of Port Hudson, on the west side of United States Route 61. The property of the site extends west to Thompson Creek, and is bounded on the north by Sandy Creek and partly on the south by Foster Creek. This area forms a terrace about above the creeks, with twisting and steep terrain that made for a natural defensive position, and is where Union Army forces were dug in. The area immediately to the southwest of Foster Creek has similar terrain, and is where Confederate defensive positions were located. These positions were but a small portion of the total offensive and defensive positions, which entirely ringed the community, and included artillery emplacements overlooking the nearby Mississippi River. An addition of to the site was made possible by The Conservation Fund using its Battlefield Revolving Fund established by grants from The Gilder Foundation and contributions from a number of partners.The Conservation Fund Port Hudson National Cemetery, where many dead of the siege were buried, is located about to the south, in East Baton Rouge Parish. History The Siege of Port Hudson was part of a concerted Union effort to gain full control of the Mississippi River. It was conducted May 22 ‚Äì July 9, 1863 by forces under the command of Major General Nathaniel Prentice Banks, and only ended because the Confederate General Franklin Gardner surrendered after learning of the fall of Vicksburg, Mississippi to Union forces. General Banks gave orders to two units composed entirely of African Americans, the 1st and 3rd Louisiana Native Guards, to attack the Confederate positions south of Foster Creek on the morning of May 27. There was in Union military circles some question about how these units would perform, which were among the first to include African-American field commanders. The units acquitted themselves well, reaching to within of the Confederate batteries three times before being repulsed. The overall attack plan ordered by Banks was a failure, in part due to the piecemeal, disorganized, and uncoordinated execution of its elements. The units that fought against this position suffered 37 killed, 155 wounded, and 116 missing (out of just over 1,000 men deployed), and remained in the field until ordered to retreat at 4:00 PM. Soldiers' reburial Port Hudson Peace Monument In 1997 a dedication ceremony was held to pay tribute to all soldiers who died at the siege. A group of Civil War reenactors and a modern military honor guard escorted a gun carrier, which bore a wooden coffin containing the sparse remains of victims of both sides. Following the ceremony, the coffin was lowered to its final resting place beneath a single obelisk. The remains were found during an archaeological study began in 1987 to authenticate if graves of soldiers existed at the historic Port Hudson cemetery. Testing in the first season of the study found Confederate and Union buttons confirming the graves were military. An individual buried in a uniform with Union eagle buttons was probably a Union soldier who breached the line and was shot at close range receiving buck shot in the abdominal region. Plaque on the monument reads: Archaeology surveys Port Hudson & Vicinity, 1864. A survey of Union Siege Battery 8 was conducted by archaeology students from Louisiana State University. Goals of the survey included locating the exact boundaries of the battery and finding evidence of a zigzag trench, or sap, that historical accounts say the Union troops dug from the battery to a short distance from the Confederate lines. The project will also produce a digital topographical map of the area so that park staff may overlay with historical maps.James Minton, Advocate Baker-Zachary Bureau, Students Dig Port Hudson History, October 6, 2009, Page 1B.

Crawford: 50 reference cycles as a rule of thumb. IIIT-H is making a processor having clock speed higher than i7 processors having 16 cores.

The buildings exhibit a consistency of style and construction, with exposed gable trusses and oversized paired logs at the corners, all with brown paint.Kaiser, Harvey (1997). \\"Landmarks in the Landscape\\", San Francisco: Chronicle Books , p. 147 The district is located on the shore of Yellowstone lake near the Lake Hotel The hatchery was established to provide Yellowstone cutthroat trout eggs for state and federal hatcheries outside Yellowstone. History By the early 20th century, a number of hatcheries were established in the park by the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries including hatcheries at Yellowstone Lake and Soda Butte Creek. The current Lake Fish Hatchery replaced an earlier hatchery at Lake. These hatcheries not only produced stocks for the park, but also took advantage of the great spawning stock of Yellowstone cutthroat trout to supply eggs to hatcheries around the U.S. Between 1901 and 1953, 818 million trout eggs were exported from the park to hatcheries throughout the U.S. The hatcheries and stocking operations had both positive and negative impacts on the quality of angling in Yellowstone National Park in the first half of the 20th century. Many native populations were displaced by non-natives, but there was quality brown and rainbow trout fishing in the Firehole, Madison and Gibbon Rivers. Ultimately stocking and hatchery operations negatively impacted Yellowstone cutthroat, westslope cutthroat trout and Arctic grayling populations in the park. In 1953 the National Park Service began closing the hatcheries and stopping stocking operations. The last fish stocked for the benefit of anglers was in 1955 after some 310 million fish had been released in park waters since 1889. The last hatchery was closed in 1957. Description The chief building of the district is Building 725, the South District Office for the park and the former Fish and Wildlife Service messhall. The building was built in 1935 using a \\"logs out\\" technique of construction, in which the log frame is exposed on the outside and the sheathing is set in, giving the interior a smooth wall finish. Building 726 was the hatchery itself, built in a similar style about 1930 and transferred to the Park Service in 1959. The one story building encloses about . An arched log truss is a prominent feature of the end elevation, together with a rubblestone chimney. The hatchery building was designed to accommodate park visitors, with an aquarium space with glazed panels to allow visitors to view the fish at tank level, and a balcony above the hatching troughs. Building 729 was an office and summer residence for the Fish and Wildlife Service's hatchery director. Built in 1932, the one story building matches its neighbors, in an L-shaped plan. Buildings 730 and 731 are smaller residences, built about 1931. Building 732, a garage, was built in 1930 with six bays. Building 733 was a FWS bunkhouse, built in 1930 with about . Building 735, a wash house, and 737, an oil house, complete the ensemble. Other facilities built at about the same time included boathouses, a dock, and rearing ponds, which have not survived.Lake Fish Hatchery Historic Structure Report, p. 10 The district was originally under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, but with the cessation of hatchery operations, it is now owned by the National Park Service.

History Designed in the Spanish Colonial Revival style, the Sheboygan Theater was constructed in 1928 for the Milwaukee Theatre Circuit of Universal Pictures Corporation at a cost of $600,000. The theater is an especially fine and intact example of the \\"atmospheric\\" type of movie theater developed in the 1920s, with an interior that suggests an evening in a Spanish garden. Carl Laemmle, founder of Universal, had roots in Oshkosh. The theater was eventually purchased by the Marcus Corporation and \\"twinned\\" into two separate theaters, and known as the Plaza 8 Cinema (named for an unsuccessful downtown pedestrian mall) until it was closed in 1992, when Marcus expanded its multiplex theater on Sheboygan's west side. Despite the twinning, outside a re-sloping of the auditorium floor and some modernization for concessions and restroom facilities, most of the existing architectural details were left intact, but dormant behind facade construction to accommodate the divided auditorium for the twinning. It was the last theater remaining downtown as several others had either been torn down, damaged by fire, or adapted irreversibly to other uses through the 70's and 80's. In 1996, the Weill Center Foundation purchased the building for the purpose of preserving, restoring and overseeing the future operation of the historic theater. The property was placed on the National Register of Historic Places by the United States Department of the Interior, and the State of Wisconsin Register of Historic Places by the State Historical Society of Wisconsin, on December 22, 1999. The Weill complex includes many of the buildings in the block in which the theater stands, adapted for use by the theater for ticketing, rehearsal, conference room and storage uses. The theater was the taping venue on October 2, 2019 for an episode of Golf Channel's Fehrety Live, where David Feherty previewed the (originally to be held in 2020) 2021 Ryder Cup at nearby Whistling Straits with American team captain Steve Stricker and European captain P√°draig Harrington.

In 1953, while serving in the military, Paine pitched in nine games for the Nishitetsu Lions, becoming the first major leaguer to play in Nippon Professional Baseball. He threw and batted right-handed, and was listed as tall and . Paine was born in Chepachet, Rhode Island, and signed with the Philadelphia Phillies in 1948 upon graduation from high school in nearby Burrillville. He was drafted by the Boston Braves after two years in the Phillies' farm system. Career in Japan and MLB Recalled by Boston from the Class A Hartford Chiefs in the middle of the , he worked in 21 games out of the bullpen. As a rookie, Paine won his only two decisions; he allowed 36 hits and 20 bases on balls in 35 innings pitched, but only 12 earned runs, for a respectable ERA of 3.06. He then entered the United States Army for military service during the Korean War. When his unit was sent to Japan, Paine was allowed to pitch for the Nishitetsu Lions, making his NPB debut on August 23, 1953. Unlike in the major leagues, Paine was a starting pitcher for the Lions, making eight starts among his nine appearances, and posting five complete games and one shutout. Overall, his NPB record was 4‚Äì3, with a sparkling 1.77 earned run average in 61 innings pitched.Baseball Reference In , Paine rejoined the Braves ‚Äî now in Milwaukee ‚Äî upon completion of his military service. He would continue his winning skein in a Brave uniform by posting a 3‚Äì0 record through . But his inconsistent performance resulted in assignments to the minor leagues for parts of four consecutive seasons. Finally, in April of , he was claimed off waivers by the St. Louis Cardinals. The 1958 campaign was Paine's only full year in the major leagues. He worked in a career-high 46 games, and won another four consecutive decisions (to go 9‚Äì0 for his career) before losing his first MLB game on July 29 against his original organization, the Phillies.Retrosheet: 1958 regular season pitching log for Phil Paine As late as August 9, his earned run average was below the 2.00 mark. But two ineffective appearances over the season's final two months inflated Paine's ERA to 3.56. He was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers during the off-season, played at the Triple-A level for three years, and never returned to the majors. All told, in 95 MLB career games pitched, all in relief, Paine posted a 10‚Äì1 win‚Äìloss record (for a winning percentage of .909) with one save. In 150 total innings pitched he surrendered 144 hits and 80 bases on balls, with 101 strikeouts. Personal life Paine married Jeannette Orsini of Hummelstown, Pennsylvania, after meeting her while he was posted nearby during his U.S. Army basic training. They settled in Hummelstown to raise their family, with Paine helping to operate his in-laws' hotel and restaurant.

The poem is a renunciation of religion, and Catholicism in particular. It includes a blasphemous inversion of the Kyrie Eleison and the Glory Be, parts of the Catholic Mass, or it substitutes Satan for Mary and liturgy directed towards her. Swinburne called it the key to Les Fleurs du mal. The poet empathises with Satan, who has also experienced injustice and can have pity for those who are outcasts. But for political reasons, Baudelaire had to preface the poem with a note explaining he had no personal allegiance with Satan. Even so, Les Fleurs du mal led to him and his publishers being fined for \\"insult to public decency\\".

He is remembered as the nominal author of a publication that caused one of the biggest controversies of 19th-century English botany.  Career  Born in Brindle, Lancashire, he became head gardener to George Hibbert, who was an enthusiastic amateur botanist. Hibbert became caught up in the craze for cultivating Proteaceae, and as a result Knight became adept at their cultivation and propagation. He eventually set himself to write a book on their cultivation, which would be published in 1809 under the title On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae. Despite the title, this book contained only 13 pages related to cultivation techniques, but over 100 pages of taxonomic revision. Although not explicitly attributed, this 100 page revision is known to have been contributed by Richard Salisbury. In it, Salisbury published for the first time many plant names that he had memorised from Robert Brown's reading of his On the Proteaceae of Jussieu to the Linnean Society of London in the first quarter of 1809, which was subsequently published in March 1810. Knight and Salisbury thus beat Brown to print and claimed priority for the names that Brown had authored. As a result, Salisbury was accused of plagiarism, ostracised from botanical circles, and his publications were largely ignored during his lifetime. Although Salisbury's generic names have almost all been overturned, many of his specific names have been reinstated; since the nominal author was Knight, not Salisbury, Knight is now considered the author of a great many Proteaceae species. On Hibbert's retirement around 1829, Hibbert passed his collection of living plants on to Knight, and helped him set up a nursery on Kings Road in Chelsea. It traded initially under the name Royal Exotic Nursery, and later, after partnering with Thomas Aloysius Perry, who married Knight's niece, as Knight & Perry. This nursery was a great success, and would eventually be sold and become one of the famous Veitch Nurseries.  Personal  In 1820 Knight married Mary Lorymer. In 1831, he gave money to his old Parish in Lancashire, Brindle St Joseph's, to build a new school. This building is still in use as the Parish Hall. Some time after his wife's death in 1845, Knight built a mansion, Bitham House, in Avon Dassett, retiring there with his niece and Perry. Shortly before his death, he built a Catholic church of St Joseph in Avon Dassett. This was consecrated on 3 July 1855, only seventeen days before Knight's death on 20 July 1855.

Life and career After National Service, Aagaard worked at Woolworth's, a company of which his father was a director. However, his love of antique furniture led him to train as a furniture maker, in the Cotswolds and at Harrogate, Yorkshire. At Harrogate he had his own showrooms and operated a factory at Knaresborough which made period fireplaces and decorations needed by conservation schemes, with thirty employees.

Retrieved 11 August 2008 The beginning of the movement came when the Dean of Ripon Cathedral asked Aagaard to organise on a voluntary basis the restoration of a house owned by the cathedral. While this work was in hand, Aagaard visited his son who was staying at a National Trust Acorn Camp and realised that cathedrals could also harness the enthusiasm of young people, training them as volunteer labour and giving them in return an interesting working holiday. In the early 1980s, the Aagaards raised funds and found trustees, including architects, artists, and deans of cathedrals. Establishing a supply of suitable tools and conservation materials, insurance, accommodation, and transport all needed careful planning. In the twenty years during which Aagaard headed the organisation, Cathedral Camps enabled some nine thousand students to spend time working and living in cathedrals. Camps were organised every year at twenty-four centres, mostly English cathedrals, but also some larger parish churches and some Church of Scotland, free church, and Roman Catholic places of worship.Robert Aagaard, obituary in The Independent dated Tuesday, 3 April 2001.

It was conducted on 7 August 2008 by the Frontier Corps and Infantry Brigade of Pakistan army. The operation was primarily launched to end the political movement of the Taliban. Bajaur area was administered by Taliban until 2007, and it remained Al-Qaeda's central command and control for carrying out activities in Northeast Afghanistan and Kunar province. Recent reports indicate that ongoing conflict has newly displaced an estimate of 7,000 people between 3 and 4 March in Nurgal district. Ambush in Bajaur During the early days of August in 2008, a check-post was established by the Frontier Corps to seize control of the Afghan-Pakistan border crossing over Tehrik-e-Taliban. Check-post was constructed near the town of Loyesam which is 12 km away from Khaar. Loyesam (or Loisam) is a strategic position that controls passage into Afghanistan's Kunar province. The militant attacks caused heavy casualties to the Pakistani army. Eventually, the army was relocated to Khar town. Background Several days later, the Frontier Corps began a large-scale offensive under the command of Major-General Tariq Khan, codenamed Operation Sherdil (Lion heart), intending to regain control of Bajaur from the Taliban. About 8,000 troops belonging to the FC and Army, backed by Cobra attack helicopters and fighter jets were deployed that attacked Taliban hideouts. To support the Army, the Pakistan Air Force responded with aggressive air campaign. Pakistani military sources revealed that the army was surprised by the resistance of the insurgents. Taliban used advanced tactics to fight prepared defense system. By the end of the year, the Army claimed that it had killed more than 1,000 militants, including the foreign commander of Al Qaeda, an Egyptian called Abu Saeed Al-Masri. The Army suffered 20 casualties. The military encouraged local tribes to rebel against the Taliban by raising the lascars (tribal militias) to fight alongside the government forces. The Salarzai tribe reportedly counted 4,000 armed fighters, responded favorably to this initiative. On 7 October, the Salarzai elders announced that they had cleared their tribal territory of militants, and requested the deployment of government troops to consolidate the gains they had made. According to several sources, 20 September Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing might have occurred in retaliation for the military offensive in Bajaur. On 8 October, during a briefing to the Parliament, the military announced that the operation killed 2,744 militants, including 321 foreigners, and caused 1,400 casualties to the militants. On 25 October, the Pakistan forces reportedly recaptured Taliban militants in Loi Sam village.http://ukpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5hZu3Qpjdvqh8valFIKmIDGT_F_dg About 500 militants were reportedly killed in the Bajaur area on 25 October. By the end of 2008, security forces were stationed at Torghudai, Nawagai, Utmankhel, and Salarzai. By mid-2009, the security forces controlled the bulk of the Mamund and Chahrmang valleys as well. The last operation was launched in February 2010 with fresh reinforcements to mop up the last pockets of militants, including the notorious Damadola stronghold. Bajaur was ultimately declared clear in March 2010. When the operation was completed, a large number of militants surrendered before the army.  Strategic significance  The opinion of military leaders in the early stages of the battle asserted that it was a decisive confrontation of Pakistan's war against the Taliban. Military officials allegedly said the conflict \\"could decide the fate of other tribal areas\\" with Bajaur possibly being the most crucial militant stronghold outside of Waziristan. The influx of Taliban fighters from the Kunar province across the border of Afghanistan was viewed as a further sign that dictated the nature of the fight by diverting resources away from fighting with International Security Assistance Force. Results On 28 February 2009,Talibowie strictly prowincjƒô Bad≈ºur rp.pl the security forces defeated the Taliban and other Islamist militants in Bajaur, which was a strategically important region on the Afghan border. Major-General Tariq Khan, who was commanding the military operations in five of the seven agencies stated that the Army and the Frontier Corps killed most militants in Bajaur, the smallest of the agencies but a major infiltration route into Afghanistan, after a six- month long offensive. The Pakistan Army killed over 1,800 militants. However, the forces suffered 30 deaths and four casualties. Leadership Maj Gen. Tariq Khan Gen. Tariq Khan served as the Inspector General of the Frontier Corps during Operation Sherdil. He is known as the architect of the Battle of Bajaur.

Nauman led the link-up unit on 8 August 2008 after the previous day's failed link attempt. The troops were ambushed at Tankhatta, where they retaliate and held their positions for over 8 hours against well-entrenched militants to facilitate previous filtration of the party besieged at Loesam. In another incident, the convoy of Inspector- General Frontier Corps Major-General Tariq Khan was ambushed on 9 September 2009 at Nissarabad. Col.

It was created to preserve one of the last free-roaming American bison (buffalo) herds in the United States. The ranch was established in 1907 when 28 bison were moved from Fort Yellowstone to the Lamar Valley in the northeast corner of the park. The herd at the Lamar Buffalo Ranch was maintained as a semi- domesticated source of additional bison to enhance the park's natural herd. As the ranched herd increased in size, it was released to the open range, where it interbred with the wild herd. After the ranched bison were successfully integrated, the ranch continued to be used to produce hay to feed wild bison in the winter until the 1950s. Because the winter feeding program maintained the herd at artificially high levels and distorted the distribution of bison in the park, it fell from favor as the National Park Service adopted wildlife management policies that attempted to interfere as little as possible with each species' natural ecology. Today the Lamar Buffalo Ranch is maintained as an historic district comprising five buildings built in the early 20th century. The complex includes a ranger station built in 1915, a bunkhouse built in 1929, a residence which was moved from Soda Butte in 1938, a barn built in 1927, and a corral. The interior of the bunkhouse has since been remodeled and is currently used by the park's public stewardship institute, Yellowstone Forever (formerly the Yellowstone Association), which conducts classes and seminars there.

The Omaha and other tribes asked the government to set aside territory for their mixed-race descendants. Under the patrilineal systems of the Omaha and Osage, children of white fathers had no place in the tribes, where children belonged to their father's gens. Seeking to help mixed-blood Indian descendants get settled in society, the United States government designated allotments of land in western territory for their use. These were known as the Half-Breed Tracts. Because of American Indian tribes' rules of descent and membership, European-American society's discrimination, and the distance that such mixed-race families lived from most European Americans, the children of unions between European fathers and certain Indian mothers were often left outside the social networks of both societies. Generally Indian women and their French-Canadian trader husbands and children lived under the protection of the women's tribes, but their descendants were not considered members of the tribes unless they were officially adopted, as they had white fathers, so were considered \\"white\\".

Each had five gentes or clans, considered to have been descended from an ancestor representing an element of each moitie. Each gens had a hereditary chief from the male line. Each moitie was represented by a head chief, and the two kept balance in the tribe. The clans had specific responsibilities related to their moitie. Children belonged to their father's gens, so within this structure, there was no place for children whose father was outside the culture, unless they were officially adopted into the tribe.Dennis McAuliffe, Bloodland: A Family Story of Oil, Murder and Greed on the Osage Reservation, Times Books, 1994 At the same time, the European- American \\"tribe\\" of the majority of the United States considered the children to be Native American, because of their mothers, although the United States society was generally patriarchal, and patrilineal in terms of inheritance and descent. The United States government selected an allotment of land along the Missouri River bluffs, an area described as \\"too steep and tree-covered for farming, fit only for hunting.\\" It was described in the Treaty of Prairie du Chien of 1830, confirmed by the Otoe, Omaha, Missouria, and other tribes and the government, which established the rules for the half-breed tract.

These bacteria can produce novel enzymes that allow them to feed on by-products of nylon manufacture which did not exist prior to the invention of nylon in the 1930s.Kinoshita, S., Kageyama, S., Iba, K., Yamada, Y. and Okada, H. Utilization of a cyclic dimer and linear oligomers of Œµ-aminocapronoic acid by Achromobacter guttatus K172, Agric. Biol. Chem. 116, 547-551 (1981), FEBS 1981 Observation of these adaptations refute religious and pseudoscientific claims that no new information can be added to a genome and that proteins are too complex to evolve through a process of mutation and natural selection. Apologists have produced reactionary literature attempting to deny that evolution occurs, in turn generating input from the scientific community.  Evidence and education  There is scientific consensus that the capacity to synthesize nylonase most probably developed as a single-step mutation that survived because it improved the fitness of the bacteria possessing the mutation. This is seen as a good example of evolution through mutation and natural selection that has been observed as it occurs and could not have come about until the production of nylon by humans. The discovery was first publicized by science education advocates like the National Center for Science Education, and New Mexicans for Science and Reason (NMSR) who stated that research refutes claims made by creationists and intelligent design proponents. The claims were that random mutation and natural selection can never add new information to a genome and that the odds against a useful new protein, such as an enzyme, arising through a process of random mutation would be prohibitively high. Physicist Dave Thomas, the President of NMSR, noted that gene duplication and frame-shift mutations were powerful sources of random mutation. In particular, in response to comments by creationists such as Don Batten, NMSR has stated that it was these mutations that gave rise to nylonase, even if the genes were part of a plasmid as suggested by Batten.  Apologetics  Proponents of creationism, such as Answers in Genesis and Creation Ministries International, have cited horticulturalist and apologist Don Batten, pointing out that scientific research showed that the genes involved were on a plasmid, and claiming that the phenomenon is evidence that plasmids in bacteria are a designed feature, intended to allow bacteria to adapt easily to new food sources or cope with toxic chemicals. Batten wrote: > It seems clear that plasmids are designed features of bacteria that enable > adaptation to new food sources or the degradation of toxins. The details of > just how they do this remains to be elucidated. The results so far clearly > suggest that these adaptations did not come about by chance mutations, but > by some designed mechanism. These claims have been dismissed. NMSR pointed out that the gene duplication and frame-shift mutations that gave rise to nylonase were powerful sources of random mutation, whether or not the genes were part of a plasmid as suggested by Batten. A posting at TalkOrigins Archive by Ian Musgrave asserted that bacteria carry many genes in plasmids, particularly those involved in xenobiotic handling or metabolic functions. Musgrave added that in Pseudomonas, most of the xenobiotic degradation genes are on plasmids. Therefore it is entirely likely that a xenobiotic handling enzyme will arise from mutations of xenobiotic handling genes. The fact that these genes are on plasmids does not invalidate the fact that they exist, and exist only in two strains of bacteria. Musgrave also criticized Batten for mis-stating the conclusions of some of the authors of the scientific literature on nylon- eating bacteria. MSNBC published an editorial from science writer Ker Than that stated that the evolution of the enzymes, known as nylonase, produced by nylon-eating bacteria was a compelling argument against the claim made by intelligent design proponents that specified complexity required an intelligent designer, since nylonase function was both specified and complex. Theologian and intelligent design proponent William Dembski posted a response that questioned whether the genetic changes that produced nylonase were complex enough to be considered specified complexity. Biology professor Ken Miller said that intelligent design proponents claim that we can't see either design or evolution taking place and that therefore, according to the design proponents, intelligent design and evolution are both just matters of faith or world view. He added that however, the evolution of the enzyme nylonase, which scientists were able to repeat in the lab with another strain of bacteria, is one of a number of cases that show that evolution can be observed as it occurs.

He also plays the clarinet and the piccolo. Wilson has maintained a busy career working as a session musician, and has contributed to many musicians of note both in the recording studios, but as a sideman on tours. Over the years he has participated in engagements with several musical ensembles, as well as his own solo efforts. Wilson has not confined himself to the studio and stage. He has held teaching positions in several schools and Universities, as well as holding jazz clinics. Biography As a teenager, Wilson played in rhythm and blues (R&B;) and funk bands. After a year accompanying singer Stephanie Mills, he attended Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond where he majored in music. In 1987 he moved to New York City, where he established himself as a sideman. He performed with the American Jazz Orchestra, the Mingus Big Band, and the Smithsonian Jazz Orchestra. In 1988 he toured Europe with Lionel Hampton. Early in his career he was a member of Out of the Blue, a group which featured young Blue Note Records artists. Wilson was the subject of a 1996 New York Times profile, entitled \\"A Sideman's Life\\". That year he joined the Dave Holland Quintet. From 1998‚Äì2001 he was a member of Chick Corea's Origin sextet. He played and recorded on Japanese composer Yoko Kanno's debut album, Song to Fly and part of The Seatbelts' New York Musicians during that period. In 1997 he formed the Steve Wilson Quartet with pianist Bruce Barth, double bassist Ed Howard, and drummer Adam Cruz. The group performed for over a decade and recorded two albums. He also headed a larger ensemble, Generations, which performed jazz and original compositions, and he has performed in a duo with drummer Lewis Nash. Wilson performing with The Blue Note 7 at the Manchester Craftsmen's Guild in Pittsburgh April 4, 2009 In May 2007 he performed as a soloist for Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip during the Jamestown, Virginia quadricentennial. Wilson is on the faculty at the Manhattan School of Music, City College of New York, State University of New York at Purchase, and Columbia University. He has been an artist-in-residence at the University of North Carolina, Hamilton College, Old Dominion University, and with the CITYFOLK arts program in Dayton, Ohio. A septet formed that year in honor of the 70th anniversary of Blue Note Records. The group recorded an album in 2008, entitled Mosaic, which was released in 2009 on Blue Note/EMI, and toured the United States in promotion of the album from January until April 2009.Allaboutjazz The group plays the music of Blue Note Records from various artists, with arrangements by members of the band and Renee Rosnes. In 2010, Wilson celebrated his 50th birthday at Jazz Standard in New York City. He led six bands in six nights, with jazz musicians that included Karrin Allyson, Bruce Barth, Adam Cruz, Carla Cook, Ed Howard, Lewis Nash, Ugonna Okegwo, Jeff \\"Tain\\" Watts, Freddie Hendrix, Christian McBride, Mulgrew Miller, Linda Oh, Geoffrey Keezer, and John Wikan. One special feature was the inclusion of a string section to play music from Bird with Strings. It was composed of Diane Monroe, Nardo Poy, Joyce Hammann, Chern Hwei, and Troy Stuart. The Wall Street Journal wrote a full-length feature article. In 2017 Wilson released a vinyl lp titled Sit Back, Relax & Unwind which was recorded, mixed and mastered exclusively with analog technology. The band on the album was Ray Angry, Ben Williams and Willie Jones III and it was released by JMI Recordings.

It comprises a single, two and three-storey masonry Inter-war Art Deco style theatre and retail building. History The building was originally known as the Lyceum Theatre and was designed by David McClure, and built by Simon Alexander, whose family owned the premises. The Alexander family also owned the Alexander Building on the south-west (opposite) corner of Beaufort and Walcott Streets. It was constructed in 1914/1915 in a Federation Free Classical style and was designed for a mixture of vaudeville and lantern slide shows. By 1922, the Lyceum Theatre was advertising \\"motion pictures and popular orchestra\\". In the mid-1920s, with the development and popularity of silent movies, the Lyceum was converted to a cinema, and the name was changed from the Lyceum to the State Theatre. In 1939 the theatre was redesigned in an Art Deco style by William Leighton, and reconstructed by Simon Alexander's son John. In the late 1930s Leighton secured a reputation as a leading cinema designer for his work on several Perth cinemas, including the Piccadilly Theatre and Arcade, the Windsor Theatre in Nedlands, and the Cygnet Cinema in South Perth. He was also behind the refurbishment of the Royal Theatre and Grand Theatre. The remodelling of the State Theatre left it structurally intact but altered its appearance, \\"dispensing with the arches and pediments and imposing a simple restrained facade\\". The alterations included the entrance to the picture garden, and made provision for a grocery store on the corner, a millinery shop, and refreshments in the cinema vestibule. Leighton's Art Deco design introduced the Mayan flower to the Theatre. The Art Deco theme runs from the Main Auditorium through the external facades to Beaufort and Walcott Streets. The remodelled State Theatre opened on 12 May 1939. The Astor Theatre received its current name in 1941 when an Act of Parliament decreed it an offence for a private business to use the name \\"State\\". Mr John Alexander's wife, Mavis, renamed the theatre The Astor in memory of a theatre of the same name in New Farm, Brisbane that was the first cinema they went to after their marriage. With the decline in cinema attendances in the 1950s and 1960s due to the introduction of television, the Astor Theatre became a shadow of its former self, eventually reduced to showing pornographic films. It was also used as a venue for a number of activities including amateur dramatic shows, a dancing studio and bingo. In December 1978, Astor Theatre was purchased by a group of Perth businessmen and families. In 1988 rumours grew that Astor Theatre was to be demolished, and Ron Regan, from Sydney, arranged a five-year lease of Astor Theatre through his company Entrevision Pty Ltd. In 1989, the 50th anniversary of its Art Deco redevelopment, the Theatre underwent an extensive refurbishment by Philip McAllister, Architect for Entrevision Cinemas Pty Ltd, who wished to return the cinema to its Art Deco glory and provide a quality film experience in a quality environment. The Astor Cinema was officially re-opened on 26 July 1989 by the mayor of the City of Stirling, Cr. A. A. Spagnolo, prior to a screening of Australian director Peter Weir's film Dead Poets Society. Astor Theatre, Mount Lawley 21st century Since its reopening, the Astor Cinema has undergone further refurbishment in November 2006, with the cinema facilities continuing to be upgraded. In August 2008, the owners announced that the cinema would close because it is no longer profitable, stating that \\"the cinema had been running at a loss for some time, with just $34 in takings in four hours of trading\\". A Music Rocks Australia concert (a kid rock band group of schools) was one of the last performances at the Astor. The theatre reopened in October 2009, and now hosts live music, comedy and other community events. Heritage value The Astor Theatre was classified by the National Trust (WA) on 1 August 1988. The building is also included on the City of Stirling Municipal Inventory. and was permanently listed on the State Register of Heritage Places on 14 May 1999.

It originally aired on September 16, 2008. Plot Lou (Christine Woods) is a thirty-seven-year-old woman who works as the assistant to a high-profile feminist activist and travels around the world at her boss's side. In the middle of a meeting, Lou suddenly began to hallucinate ants crawling all over her body. She is admitted to House's treatment for what at first appear to be psychiatric symptoms. While House is in the midst of disregarding the patient, Foreman states that she was also found to have abdominal pain, anemia, and bradycardia. House moves on with running a cross-diagnosis with his team while they, in turn, are wondering if House has yet to speak with Wilson. House moves on stating that it could be an illness that was contracted while flying around the world. Suggesting that Thirteen has tested positive for Huntington's, he quickly moves on to the treatment and diagnosis of Lou, telling the team to test for vitamin B12 deficiency. While Thirteen administers the shot, Lou complains of fecal incontinence, but Thirteen discovers that she has instead passed a large amount of blood. Upper and lower endoscopies came back normal and no source of bleeding could be found. Her pregnancy test came back positive, but when Kutner performed a uterine ultrasound he was unable to find a fetus. The team is now considering the diagnoses of choriocarcinoma and selective immunoglobulin A deficiency. House disagrees with all three possibilities and reveals that the patient has an ectopic pregnancy. He does an ultra-sound without warning and shows Thirteen that the fetus has implanted in the intestine, and this is causing Lou's bleeding and other symptoms. The fetus cannot survive where it is and is a threat to Lou's life, so Chase has to surgically terminate the pregnancy. Lou continues to have a slow heart rate after the surgery, while also developing new neurological signs. Her heart rate continues to drop going so low that she slips into cardiac arrest; but the team is able to revive her. Anxiety, stroke, and Tourette's syndrome are suggested for her neurological symptoms, but Taub points out that they wouldn't explain her low heart rate. Thirteen suspects multiple sclerosis, and the patient is started on Interferon. There is no improvement on the treatment ‚Äî in fact, she develops a fever. Thirteen now suspects Lou somehow became infected during the surgery. On reviewing the surgical tapes, the team notices a small nodule in the intestine that they think might possibly be a ganglioma which could have caused her symptoms. They want Chase to perform another surgery to biopsy it, but he refuses. Instead, they decide on a do-it-yourself biopsy, with no anesthesia. Under the microscope, the biopsy shows no ganglioma, and is suggestive of amyloidosis. To treat the amyloidosis, Taub states that they need to discover what caused it. Wilson looks at the biopsy and decides that it could be lymphoma, and that's good enough for Foreman to start Lou on chemotherapy. She does show improvement, but then House appears, and pointing to the previously unmentioned bruises on her legs, says that she has diffuse lepromatous leprosy and this is what has been the cause of all her problems. At the end of the episode, Thirteen expresses her disbelief that Lou intends to return to her previous job. Earlier in the episode, when Lou thought she was dying, she had told Thirteen of her plans to make a better life for herself. House tells Thirteen that he likes her better now that she is dying, then enters Wilson's office and offers an apology in a final attempt to make him stay. Wilson tells House that he does not blame him for Amber's death and that Amber was never the real reason why he was leaving. Wilson says that he has realized that House is rude and malicious to everybody he knows, including him, and throughout their entire friendship, he's been enabling his behavior. Wilson claims that as long as the two remain friends, he will always continue this negative atmosphere. Then he exits his office and leaves House in the room alone. Reception Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club graded the episode a B+, stating \\"Grief also plays a part in the Wilson storyline, and it's here where 'Dying' really clicks\\".

He is noted for his efforts to place religious disagreements on a rational historical footing, for his advocacy of a liberal form of Protestantism, and for his endeavors as an educator, librarian, and scholar in Irish history.  Early life  He was the son of Charles Hawkes Todd, a professor of surgery, and Eliza Bentley, and was the oldest of fifteen children. Noted physician Robert Bentley Todd, William Gowan Todd, and Armstrong Todd were among his younger brothers. His father died a year after he received a B.A. from Trinity College in 1825, diminishing his prospects for success. However, he was able to remain at the college by tutoring and editing a church periodical.  Professional life  Regent House at Trinity College He obtained a premium in 1829, and two years later was elected Fellow, taking deacon's orders in the same year. From that time until 1850, when he became a Senior Fellow, he was among the most popular tutors in Trinity College. Todd took priest's orders in 1832. He began publishing in earnest, including papers on John Wycliffe, church history, and the religious questions of his day. He was Donnellan Lecturer in 1838 and 1839, publishing works related to the Antichrist in which he opposed the views of the more extreme of his co- religionists who applied this term to the Roman Catholicism and the Pope. In 1840 he graduated Doctor of Divinity. In 1837 he had been installed Treasurer at St. Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin, and would become Precentor in 1864. His style of preaching was described as simple and lucid, and his sermons interesting. He co-founded Saint Columba's College in 1843, a school which promoted the Irish language for those who intended to take orders, as well as promoting the principles of the Church of Ireland. Saint Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin In 1849 Todd was made Regius Professor of Hebrew at Trinity, and a Senior Fellow the following year. In 1852 he was appointed Librarian, and working alongside John O'Donovan and Eugene O'Curry, he classified and arranged the collection of manuscripts. When his office received money, he spent it on the acquisition of manuscripts and rare books, and he deserves much credit for the library's high ranking as one of the chief libraries of Europe. His secular achievements were no less remarkable. In 1840 Todd co- founded the Irish Archaeological Society and acted as its honorary secretary. He was elected a member of the Royal Irish Academy, and strove actively to acquire transcripts and accurate accounts of Irish manuscripts from foreign libraries. He was honorary secretary from 1847 to 1855, and president from 1856 to 1861. In 1860 he was given an ad eundem degree at Oxford. Todd was a notable person among notable people. His work was widely respected and cited. Among his friends and acquaintances were lawyer and poet Sir Samuel Ferguson, Conservative MP and Roman Catholic convert Edwin Wyndham-Quin, fellow historian William Reeves, artist Sir George Petrie, and the Stokes family (physician father William, future lawyer and Celticist son Whitley, and future antiquarian daughter Margaret). James Henthorn Todd died at his house in Rathfarnham on 28 June 1869 and was buried in the churchyard of St. Patrick's Cathedral.

Jolimont Workshops was a railway workshop operated by the Victorian Railways beside Jolimont Yard, near the Melbourne CBD, Australia. Opened in 1917 and dedicated to the maintenance and repair of electric multiple units and locomotives, it was the first part of the yard to be closed and relocated, with demolition completed in 1994. The site is now part of the Melbourne Park tennis complex. History Built as part of the electrification of the Melbourne suburban network, it was the main storage, servicing and maintenance depot for the new fleet of suburban trains. The workshops was erected to the south along Batman Avenues, with the storage sidings located between the running lines. The site had been home to the Princes Bridge locomotive depot built in 1888. This depot had replaced a small engine shed located east of the station of the same name and built in 1859 by the Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company. In addition to the maintenance of the suburban multiple unit fleet, the E class suburban freight locomotives were housed there from their introduction, as steam locomotives were housed at the North Melbourne Locomotive Depot. The L class mainline electrics followed on their introduction in the 1950s, but were moved with the diesel fleet to the new South Dynon Locomotive Depot in 1964, and the entire E class fleet followed in June 1968. Until relocated to Spencer Street, the Victorian Railways housed their railmotors fleet at the depot. By the 1950s they included the AEC, Leyland, Dodge, petrol electric, and 102hp, 153hp and 280hp Walker railmotors. The workshops had a whistle that signalled the start of the workday, which could heard in the city and surrounding suburbs. Rumored to be a WW2 air raid siren, it was the last industrial whistle in central Melbourne. After the opening of the adjacent Tennis Centre officials asked for the whistle to be silenced, which was eventually done. Facilities Train lifted off bogies in the lifting bay The workshops had a main carshed, with tracks leading into it at both the east (Richmond) and west (Flinders Street) ends. The brick car shed was 109 metres wide, 122 to 183 metres long depending of the section, and was designed to be expanded to a uniform width of 305 metres. The car shed was divided into three separate sections: * The workshop and fitting bays were each 183 by 18 metres in size, with four tracks and three inspection pits. For the handling of bogies under overhaul there were 24 short traverse tracks and pits. Two 25 tonne cranes were installed in the lifting bay, and two 15 tonne electric cranes were provided in the workshop bay. * The inspection and running bay was 122 by 37 metres in size, and had nine tracks all with inspection pits. * The painting and varnishing bay was 122 by 32 metres in size, and had five tracks, all equipped with overhead platform level with car floors for the use of workers. A turntable was provided for reversing the cabs of motor cars and driving trailers into the required direction. A carriage wash was also located at the workshops for cleaning the exterior of trains. Shunters The workshops were assigned a variety of different shunting locomotives for use in the yard: * Two Swing Door motor carriages, numbered 113M (single ended) and 156M (double ended) and modified with dual pantographs. 113M was used as shunter from at least 1926 and 156M was used as a temporary parcels coach from 1923, both cars continuing in this use until about 1990. * A V class diesel hydraulic locomotive, numbered V 56 and used for hauling suburban trains though the carriage wash. Demise By the mid-1980s the Metropolitan Transit Authority (successor to the Victorian Railways) drew up plans for the closure and decentralisation of the Jolimont Workshops, with new railway facilities to be built around suburban Melbourne. The original plan included: *Epping Workshops: :* maintenance and repair area for 6 three car sets :* lifting jacks for a 3 car set :* acid wash and steam cleaning pit :* depot for 120 train crew :* stabling for 13 three car trains, in single train sidings *Nunawading: :* maintenance area for 10 three car sets :* lifting, washing and steam cleaning pit :* depot for 83 train crew :* stabling for 12 six car trains, in single train sidings *Oakleigh :* inspection and repair facilities :* lifting, washing and steam cleaning pit :* depot for 65 train crew :* stabling for 15 three car trains, in single train sidings * Newport Workshops :* repair facilities for 7 three car sets :* lifting, washing and steam cleaning pit :* depot for 132 train crew :* stabling for 15 six car trains, in double ended two train long sidings * Carrum :* Extend and reconstruct existing sidings :* depot for 26 train crew * Mordialloc :* Construction of an additional 100m long siding :* depot for 18 train crew *Macaulay :* new main line crossover :* depot for 50 train crew Of the proposals, the Nunawading facility was dropped due to protests by local residents. Epping Workshops was the first main facility to open, entering service in 1990. Further expansion of workshop facilities did not happen until the rationalisation of Jolimont Yard itself in 1997, with a smaller facility built at Bayswater to replace the abandoned Nunawading facility, while a second was built at Westall instead of that at Oakleigh. Macaulay also gained a light maintenance facility beside the existing stabling yard in 1993. A replacement washing plant and stabling sidings were made operational in Melbourne Yard in May 1995. The workshops finally closed in April 1993. Track and overhead was removed by November 1993, with demolition of the workshops approved in May 1994, and the inspection and paint shops demolished by August 1994. The land was used to expand the Melbourne Park tennis centre, with the opening of additional outside courts to the north of Rod Laver Arena.

For an expository article, see Modes of convergence. Simple logical relationships between different modes of convergence are indicated (e.g., if one implies another), formulaically rather than in prose for quick reference, and indepth descriptions and discussions are reserved for their respective articles.  Guide to this index. To avoid excessive verbiage, note that each of the following types of objects is a special case of types preceding it: sets, topological spaces, uniform spaces, topological abelian groups (TAG), normed vector spaces, Euclidean spaces, and the real/complex numbers. Also note that any metric space is a uniform space. Finally, subheadings will always indicate special cases of their superheadings. The following is a list of modes of convergence for: A sequence of elements {an} in a topological space (Y) * Convergence, or \\"topological convergence\\" for emphasis (i.e. the existence of a limit). ...in a uniform space (U) * Cauchy-convergence Implications:  Convergence \\\\Rightarrow Cauchy-convergence  Cauchy-convergence and convergence of a subsequence together \\\\Rightarrow convergence.

Hand-picked for the position by Joseph Stalin in 1926, Blokhin led a company of executioners that performed and supervised numerous mass killings during Stalin's reign, mostly during the Great Purge and World War II. He is recorded as having executed tens of thousands of prisoners by his own hand, including his killing of about 7,000 Polish prisoners of war during the Katyn massacre in spring 1940,Parrish 1996, p. 324.Montefiore 2005, pp. 197-8, 332-4. making him the most prolific official executioner and mass murderer in recorded world history.Glenday, pp. 284-5. Forced into retirement following the death of Stalin, Blokhin died in 1955, his death being officially reported as a suicide. Early life and career Blokhin, born into a peasant family on 7 January 1895, served in the Imperial Russian Army during World War I, and joined the Soviet state security agency Cheka in March 1921.Montefiore 2005, p. 198 Though records are scant, he was evidently noted for both his pugnaciousness and his mastery of what Joseph Stalin termed chernaya rabota (\\"wetwork\\" , or literally, \\"black work\\"): assassinations, torture, intimidation, and executions conducted clandestinely. Once he gained Stalin's attention, he was quickly promoted and within six years was appointed the head of the purposefully created Kommandatura Branch of the Administrative Executive Department of the NKVD. This branch was a company-sized element created by Stalin specifically for wetwork.Montefiore 2005, p. 325 Headquartered at the Lubyanka in Moscow, its members were all approved by Stalin and took their orders directly from him, which ensured the unit's longevity despite three bloody purges of the NKVD. As senior executioner,Rayfield 2005, p. 324. Blokhin had the official title of commandant of the internal prison at the Lubyanka, which allowed him to carry out his duties with a minimum of scrutiny and no official paperwork. Although most of the estimated 828,000 NKVD executions conducted in Stalin's lifetime were performed by local Chekists in concert with NKVD troikas, mass executions were overseen by specialist executioners from the Kommandantura. In addition to overseeing the mass executions, Blokhin personally pulled the trigger in all of the individual high-profile executions conducted in the Soviet Union during his tenure, including those of the Old Bolsheviks convicted at the Moscow Show Trials; Marshal of the Soviet Union Mikhail Tukhachevsky (convicted at a secret trial); and two of the three killed NKVD Chiefs (Genrikh Yagoda in 1938 and Nikolai Yezhov in 1940) he had once served. He was awarded the Badge of Honour for his service in 1937.Parrish 1996, pp. 324-5. Role in the Katyn massacre Blokhin's most infamous act was the April 1940 execution by shooting of about 7,000 Polish prisoners interned in the Ostashkov prisoner of war camp in the Katyn forest. The majority were military and police officers who had been captured following the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939.Remnick 1994, pp. 5-7 The event's infamy also stems from the Stalin regime's orchestration of the murders, and the subsequent Allied propaganda campaign which blamed Nazi Germany for the massacres, aided by the Western Allies in order to preserve morale. In 1990, as part of Glasnost, Mikhail Gorbachev gave the Polish government the files on the massacres at Katyn, Starobelsk and Kalinin (now Tver), revealing Stalin's involvement. Based on the 4 April secret order from Stalin to NKVD Chief Lavrentiy Beria (as well as NKVD Order ‚Ññ 00485, which still applied), the executions were carried out over 28 consecutive nights at the specially constructed basement execution chamber at the NKVD headquarters in Kalinin, and were assigned, by name, directly to Blokhin, making him the official executioner of the NKVD.Sanford 2005, p. 112. Blokhin initially decided on an ambitious quota of 300 executions per night, and engineered an efficient system in which the prisoners were individually led to a small antechamber--which had been painted red and was known as the \\"Leninist room\\"--for a brief and cursory positive identification, before being handcuffed and led into the execution room next door. The room was specially designed with padded walls for soundproofing, a sloping concrete floor with a drain and hose, and a log wall for the prisoners to stand against. Blokhin would stand waiting behind the door in his executioner garb: a leather butcher's apron, leather hat, and shoulder-length leather gloves. Then, without a hearing, the reading of a sentence or any other formalities, each prisoner was brought in and restrained by guards while Blokhin shot him once in the base of the skull with a German Walther Model 2 .25 ACP pistol.Remnick 1994, p. 5.Sanford 2005, p. 102. He had brought a briefcase full of his own Walther pistols, since he did not trust the reliability of the standard-issue Soviet TT-30 for the frequent, heavy use he intended. The use of a German pocket pistol, which was commonly carried by German police and intelligence agents, also provided plausible deniability of the executions if the bodies were discovered later.Rayfield 2005, p. 488. An estimated 30 local NKVD agents, guards and drivers were pressed into service to escort prisoners to the basement, confirm identification, then remove the bodies and hose down the blood after each execution. Although some of the executions were carried out by Senior Lieutenant of State Security Andrei Rubanov, Blokhin was the primary executioner and, true to his reputation, liked to work continuously and rapidly without interruption. In keeping with NKVD policy and the overall \\"wet\\" nature of the operation, the executions were conducted at night, starting at dark and continuing until just prior to dawn. The bodies were continuously loaded onto covered flat-bed trucks through a back door in the execution chamber and trucked, twice a night, to Mednoye, where Blokhin had arranged for a bulldozer and two NKVD drivers to dispose of bodies at an unfenced site. Each night, 24‚Äì25 trenches were dug, measuring in length, to hold that night's corpses, and each trench was covered over before dawn. Blokhin and his team worked without pause for 10 hours each night, with Blokhin executing an average of one prisoner every three minutes. At the end of the night, Blokhin provided vodka to all his men.Remnick 1994, p. 6. On 27 April 1940, Blokhin secretly received the Order of the Red Banner and a modest monthly pay premium as a reward from Joseph Stalin for his \\"skill and organization in the effective carrying out of special tasks\\".Sanford 2005, p. 113. His tally of 7,000 shot in 28 days remains the most organized and protracted mass murder by a single individual on record, and caused him being named the Guinness World Record holder for 'Most Prolific Executioner' in 2010. Retirement and death Blokhin was forcibly retired in 1953 following Stalin's death that March. However, his \\"irreproachable service\\" was publicly noted by Beria at the time of his departure. After Beria's fall from power in June of the same year, Blokhin's rank was stripped from him in the de- Stalinization campaigns of Nikita Khrushchev. He reportedly sank into alcoholism and serious mental illness, and died on 3 February 1955, with the official cause of death listed as \\"suicide\\". Personal life Blokhin was married to Natalia Aleksandrovna Blokhina (1901‚Äì1967), and had a son, Nikolai Vasilievich Baranov (1916‚Äì1998).

In 1996 he was regarded as one of Chabad's leading authorities on Jewish mysticism. He is the leader of the Derech Chaim Movement and founder of the Gal Einai Institute, which publishes his written works. His students include Charedim, religious Zionists, and Chabad Chassidim, as well as ba'alei teshuvah. He is currently the president of a number of educational institutions, including the Od Yosef Chai yeshiva in the settlement of Yitzhar in the West Bank. Ginsburgh has a unique teaching style, and has lectured in various countries, and throughout Israel. His teachings cover a wide range of subjects, including science, psychology, marital harmony and monarchy in Israel. He has published over 100 books in Hebrew and English, most of which are edited by his students. Ginsburgh is a musician and composer. Some of his music has been performed by notable Israeli musicians. His students include Torah scholars, academics and musicians. Some of his statements regarding the differences between Jews and non-Jews have aroused controversy. Ginsburgh and his students have responded to the controversy by clarifying that his use of concepts taken from Chassidut and Kabbalah are far removed from the language that the media has adopted.  Biography   Early life  Ginsburgh was born in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1944, the only child of Shimshon Ya'akov and Bryna Malka (nee Dunie) Ginsburgh. He was considered a child prodigy in music and mathematics. Both of his grandfathers were Chabad chassidim. His parents had a great affinity to their Jewish roots and a love of the Land of Israel. His father immigrated to Israel as a young man, where he was one of the founders of the City of Ra'anana, but returned to the USA to complete his higher education. His return to Israel was delayed when the Second World War broke out and he remained in the USA, where he married Ginsburgh's mother. His father held a PhD in education and served as principal of a number of Jewish schools. The family later moved to Cleveland, Ohio, where Ginsburgh grew up until the age of 14, when his parents spent a year in Israel while his father wrote his doctorate on teaching the Hebrew language. During their year in Israel, the young Ginsburgh studied at the Hebrew Gymnasium in Rechavia, where he learned Hebrew and began his path to Torah study by reading Ethics of the Fathers, which left a great impression upon him. Upon their return to Philadelphia, he met the Rebbe of the Nadvorna Chassidic dynasty, Rabbi Meir Isaacson, author of the Mevasser Tov responsa, and at the age of 15 became a baal teshuva. He attended the University of Chicago, majoring in mathematics and philosophy. He then completed a Masters in Mathematics at the Belfer Graduate School of Science of Yeshiva University. At the age of 20, he abandoned his doctorate studies to devote himself entirely to Torah study.  Israel  In 1965 he returned to Israel and studied at the Yeshivah of Kamenitz in Jerusalem. He spent 1966 through 1967 at the Slonim shul in Tiberias. After the Six-Day War, Ginsburgh went to Jerusalem and was one of the first to move into the old Jewish quarter. There, together with his future father-in-law, Rabbi Moshe Zvi Segal, he began renovating the ruins, sleeping at night in the Tzemach Tzedek synagogue. In the summer of 1967, he went to the Torat Emet Chabad yeshivah in Jerusalem, where he studied the Chabad school of Chassidus in depth. That year he visited the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, and remained in Crown Heights, Brooklyn for several months. There, he was accepted for private audience with the Rebbe, whose guidance became his leading influence. When he returned to Israel he married Rabbi Segal's daughter, Romemia. They lived in Jerusalem, where Ginsburgh studied with Reb Asher Freund, helping to establish Freund's charity organization, Yad Ezrah. He also took part in founding Freund's Or Yerushalaim yeshivah in Jerusalem, where he taught Talmud, Shulchan Aruch, and Chassidut. During this period a kernel of students developed around him. In 1971, following an instruction from the Lubavitcher Rebbe, he moved with his wife and growing family to Kfar Chabad. In 1973, at the beginning of the Yom Kippur War, under instruction from the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Ginsburgh visited the warfront to transmit the Rebbe's blessing to officer Ariel Sharon, who later became 11th Prime Minister of Israel. The next morning, after a successful battle, Ginsburgh presented Sharon with a lulav and etrog. Ginsburgh founded the Chabad house in the Yamit settlement in Sinai, where he lived during the last few weeks before the settlement's destruction by the Israeli government in 1982. In 1982, Ginsburgh returned to Kfar Chabad, and was asked by Jerusalem rabbi and philanthropist Yosef Eliyahu Deutch to serve as head of the Shuva Yisra'el Yeshivah on Yo'el Street. Rabbi Ginsburgh gave frequent classes on a wide variety of subjects, from the exoteric to the esoteric parts of the Torah. Many were taped and form a large part of the 15,000 lecture archive of his classes. Ginsburgh served as the Rosh Yeshivah of the Od Yosef Chai Yeshivah (then located at Joseph's Tomb) from 1987 until the retreat of the IDF from the Tomb of Joseph in Nablus during the Al-Aqsa Intifada (2001). He also served as the head of a Kollel in the Menuchah Rachel Synagogue in Hebron and as the head of a Kollel in the ancient Shalom Al Yisrael Synagogue in Jericho. He currently serves as the president of a number of educational institutes run by his students, including the Torat Chaim elementary school for boys (Jerusalem), the Ya'alat Chen elementary school for girls (Jerusalem), Ma'ale Levonah high school for girls, and the Tom Vada'at Yeshivah in Jerusalem. He is also president of the Od Yosef Chai Yeshivah since its relocation to Yitzhar. In addition, he is the dean of the Torat Hanefesh School of Chassidic Psychology, founded and run by his students. Ginsburgh currently lives with his wife in Kfar Chabad. One of his sons is Rabbi Yossi Ginsburgh, the Rosh Yeshivah of Tomchei Temimim Yeshivah in Ramat Aviv.  Teachings  Ginsburgh follows Chassidic practices in his teaching style and is proficient in many aspects of Chassidic literature. He bases his teachings on Kabbalah and Chassidut and presents them in practical terms, rendering the profound concepts of the original Kabbalistic texts relevant to today's world and presenting them in modern language. Although the media has dealt almost exclusively with his two booklets that address politics, the grand majority of his work is of a broader and deeper scope. He has written books on Jewish law, Kabbalah, Torah and science, psychology, love, marriage and education. He has also published a book addressed to children, named \\"Anochi Ve'Hayeladim\\" (\\"Myself and the Children\\"). Ginsburgh specializes in analyzing modern cultural phenomena in the light of Kabbalah. These include psychology, psychoanalysis, homeopathy and economics. He has published over 100 volumes of original work in Hebrew and more than 20 in English. Some of his books have been translated into French, Russian, Spanish and Portuguese. Ginsburgh's teachings form a methodical ideology that covers three major areas: the individual, society and the Jewish national state. He has also developed a social and economical renewal strategy based on Torah teachings, called \\"The Dynamic Corporation.\\" One of his seminars was recognized by the Israeli Ministry of Education as a supplementary teachers' training course. His books are published by the not- for-profit Gal Einai Institute, founded by Ginsburgh in 1991. The Hebrew name Gal Einai is taken from Psalms 119:18, meaning \\"Open my eyes.\\" He delivers classes in Israel, and has lectured in the United States and other countries including France, Canada and England. Since December 2012, Ginsburgh has been a lead speaker at an annual gala evening commemorating the Chassidic festival 19 Kislev. The event includes performance of many of his musical compositions. In 2015, the event was held at Culture Palace in Tel Aviv, with an audience of approximately 3000 people. Since June 2016, Rabbi Ginsburgh has been delivering a monthly class in English with live international internet broadcast. The hour-long class is followed by a session in which Ginsburgh replies to questions from the viewers and from the audience in Jerusalem. Ginsburgh's style of teaching combines structured thought together with a freer, associative component that manifests in his generous use of the ancient tradition of gematria (Hebrew numerology), by which he translates between words and numbers. He also implements the use of figurate numbers in interpreting Torah verses.  Psychology  Ginsburgh's contribution to Chassidic psychotherapy has opened up new horizons in therapeutic practice, whose processes are already evident in modern clinical psychology. Ginsburgh sees awareness of the Divine as the key to successful psychological therapy. He aims to find the balance between science and the Torah, which will allow establishing psychology on the Torah together with empirical analysis of the data in order to develop working theories. Ginsburgh's writings on psychology develop the three-stage Chassidic model of submission, separation and sweetening that originated in the study halls of the Ba'al Shem Tov and his followers. He has thus severed the chain of non-Jewish religious sources upon which all western schools of psychotherapy are founded.  Meditation  Ginsburgh does not adopt foreign meditative methods. He remains faithful to the Chabad system of meditation, which consists of Torah study, pre-prayer meditation, and meditation during prayer. His particular innovation is the connection between personal consciousness achieved through meditation, and a change in the collective consciousness. Ginsburgh defines two types of meditation, \\"general meditation\\" (◊î÷¥◊™÷∞◊ë÷º◊ï÷π◊†÷∞◊†◊ï÷º◊™ ◊õ÷∞÷º◊ú÷∏◊ú÷¥◊ô◊™) and \\"detailed meditation\\" (◊î÷¥◊™÷∞◊ë÷º◊ï÷π◊†÷∞◊†◊ï÷º◊™ ◊§÷∞÷º◊®÷∏◊ò÷¥◊ô◊™) The purpose of general meditation, according to Ginsburgh, is to arouse one's natural love and awe of God. In order to arouse love, he recommends meditating on how God vitalizes the individual and the entire world at every single moment of time. Similarly, he recommends meditating on God's omniscience to arouse fear of God in one's heart. According to Ginsburgh, three general meditative aids are music, movement and breathing exercises.  Music and art  Musical score for Ginsburgh's Kos-Yeshuois melody Ginsburgh began composing at a very young age. He has composed hundreds of songs and original melodies in the Chassidic tradition. He has also composed a number of musical compositions in the genre of world music. His music has been published in dozens of discs, which include discs that conserve Chassidic songs and melodies from bygone eras. Rabbi Ginsburgh has appeared and sung together with Shlomo Carlebach. Russian violin virtuoso, Sanya Kroytor has performed renderings of some of Rabbi Ginsbrugh's compositions, and has played violin accompaniment to Rabbi Ginsburgh singing the Chassidic melody Tzama Lecha Nafshi. Ginsburgh's compositions are performed by a number of musicians and singers, including Shuli Rand, Erez Lev Ari, Yosef Karduner, Yishai Ribo, Aharon Razel, Shlomo Katz, and Daniel Zamir. Israeli musician, Ariel Zilber, performs some of Ginsburgh's works. Ginsburgh has also co-designed a number of pieces of Jewelry based on ancient Kabbalistic ideas, expressing love, peace and grace.  Students  Over the years, Ginsburgh has accumulated a large number of students from all over the world. In the 1980s, a group of ba'alei teshuvah crystallized around him, some of whom were inspired to found the Bat Ayin settlement in Gush Etzion. Following the death of Rabbi Tzvi Yehuda Kook, another group of students joined him from the Merkaz Harav yeshivah. They sought to fill the gap left by their rabbi's death by heading for new spiritual horizons in Kabbalah and Chassidut. They founded the original Od Yosef Chai yeshivah at Joseph's Tomb, and sought a significant spiritual leader in these spiritual fields to serve as their head. Ginsburgh later conceded to their request to join them as their rosh yeshivah. In Israel today, there are communities of his students in Jerusalem, Bat Ayin, Yitzhar, Kfar Chabad, and Rechovot. His students include Charedim, religious Zionists, and Chabad Chassidim, as well as ba'alei teshuva. Amongst the most notable are: * Rabbi Shalom Arush, Head of the Chut shel Chesed Yeshivah and Institute. * David Refael ben Ami, Israeli singer. *Meir Ettinger, activist known for leading Hilltop Youth * Dr. Shlomo Kalish, hi-tech investor. * Dr. Daniel Shalit, conductor, composer and doctor of musicology. * Rabbi Yitzchak Shapira of Yitzhar. * Rabbi Shmuel Yaniv, Chief Rabbi of Givat Shmuel, Israel and author of books on Bible codes. * Professor Eliezer Zeiger, professor emeritus at the University of California, Los Angeles and executive director of the Torah Science Foundation. Zeiger has been a student of Rabbi Ginsburgh since 1992. Together, Ginsburgh and Zeiger have co-authored integrative Torah biology textbooks for Jewish high schools on nutrition and the nervous system. * Ariel Zilber, Israeli musician and songwriter.  Religious and political views  Ginsburgh advocates the reinstitution of Jewish monarchy in the Land of Israel. (Some of his own followers want him to be the king.) He opposes efforts to remove Jewish settlements from the West Bank and encourages his followers to attempt to dissuade soldiers and police officers from carrying out evacuations. He advocates \\"Jewish labor\\" ‚àí the idea that under the current state of affairs in the land of Israel, Jews should employ other Jews. In accordance with Maimonides' ruling and many rabbinical authorities, he believes that taking the current security risks into consideration, Gentiles should not be allowed to live in the Land of Israel,Inbari p. 149. unless they become the \\"righteous of the nations\\".Inbari p. 150. Ginsburgh also supports the rebuilding of the Jewish temple, believing that this would facilitate spiritual elevation and hasten redemption. Following a response from the Lubavitcher Rebbe, he does not currently advocate visiting the Temple Mount, the site of the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque. Ginsburgh has repeatedly said that he does not promote violence. His students say that they seek to actualize the messianic vision not by violent revolution, but by a change of consciousness that will take place within individuals and will eventually encompass the collective. In his 2007 book Kabbalah and Meditation for the Nations Ginsburgh writes, \\"Ours is the first generation in modern times to understand the truly universal human condition and to seek to bring all peoples of the earth together in peace and harmony.\\"Kabbalah and Meditation for the Nations  Controversy  In 1989, following the arrest of seven of his students after the disputed shooting of an Arab girl during a settler rampage through the Palestinian West Bank village of Kifl Haris (in response to rock-throwing by the Arab villagers), Ginsburgh reportedly \\"offered biblical justification for the view that the spilling of non-Jewish blood was a lesser offense than the spilling of Jewish blood.\\" He stated that threatening to kill Jews comes under the ruling, 'He who comes to kill you, you should kill him first.'Gideon Aran, Jewish Zionist Fundamentalism: The Bloc of the Faithful in Israel (Gush Emunin) in M.

In 1994, Ginsburgh received widespread criticism for his article \\"Baruch Hagever\\"The title means \\"Blessed is the man,\\" (from Jeremiah 17:7). A version of the article later appeared as a chapter in a book, also called \\"Baruch Hagever\\" (1995), edited anonymously by Michael ben Horin (Ehud Sprinzak, Brother against Brother, p. 259). in which he defended Baruch Goldstein who had massacred 29 Palestinian worshippers at the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron.Motti Inbari, Jewish Fundamentalism and the Temple Mount: Who Will Build the Third Temple?

The conclusion to the article is that Goldstein's act emanated from the super-rational powers of his soul, therefore one cannot rely on logical reasoning to determine whether the act was worthy or condemnable.

The Torah forbids this, emphasizing that ALL human life is sacred. > It is our task, as G-d's chosen people to enlighten all humanity and raise > the consciousness of mankind to fully recognize the sanctity of all life... > When G-d deemed it necessary that the Egyptians drown in the Red Sea to save > and liberate His chosen people, Israel, He nonetheless forbade His > ministering angels to rejoice at the death of the Egyptians, His own > creations.

It is a summary of one class he gave after the incident. Like the majority of his books, the pamphlet was edited and adapted by one of his students in his own words and style. Ginsburgh did not choose the title of the pamphlet. In 1996, Ginsburgh was arrested for administrative detention for 60 days for his pronouncements that the state should take action against Arabs in response to the recent wave of terror attacks. After an appeal against the detention, Ginsburgh was exonerated and released without charge after nineteen days. The judge declared that the accusations were baseless and that there was no danger that his words were liable to bring his students to harm Arabs. Following his release, Ginsburgh wrote, \\"The court recognized that my arrest entailed not only a violation of freedom of speech, but an attack against teaching Torah in general and Chassidic philosophy in particular.\\" In 2003, Ginsburgh was indicted on charges of encouraging racism against Arabs in his booklet \\"Tsav Hasha'a ‚Äì Tipul Shoresh\\" (◊ò÷¥◊ô◊§÷º◊ï÷º◊ú ◊©◊Å◊ï÷π◊®÷∂◊©◊Å, \\"Order of the Day ‚Äì Root Treatment\\"The original Hebrew expression usually refers to dental root canal treatment).Judge Proposes Rabbi Ginsburgh Retract Inciteful Statements 5 November 2003.

Instead, he suggested achieving goals by power of word alone, speaking out firmly but calmly to transmit the message. In May 2014, the Shin Bet claimed that the price-tag acts were the handiwork of about 100 individuals who were inspired by Ginsburgh's ideas.Amos Harel, Revital Hovel, Jack Khoury,'Security sources: 100 followers of racist rabbi are behind hate crimes' Haaretz 8 May 2014. Tzvi Sukkot, self-identified as a prior \\"hill top youth,\\" says that it was Rabbi Ginsburgh who convinced him to stop his violent activities against Arabs and find more legitimate ways to express his frustration. \\"Ginsburgh spoke out very clearly against violence. He said that we should act... within the framework of the law.\\" Ginsburgh and his students have responded to the accusations made against him by stating that he has been misunderstood and that his words have been taken out of context. In a \\"personal letter\\" distributed to a small group of protestors demonstrating outside the Culture Palace event in Tel-Aviv, Rabbi Ginsburgh wrote: > The dangerous inciting rabbi whom you perceive is not desirable in my eyes > and I do not identify with him.

These misunderstandings stem > from the differences between the personal \\"languages\\" that we use‚Ä¶ I truly > believe that by bridging these gaps we will be able to understand one > another better, and with God's help, even agree. At the same occasion, Ginsburgh's aide, Rabbi Itiel Giladi, explained that the Torah concepts of Chassidut and Kabbalah are far removed from the concepts that the media has adopted. Giladi said that this is why the media tends to view Ginsburgh's words in a superficial manner that is taken out of its true context.

Pictured is the block of Atkinson between Byron Avenue and Woodrow Wilson Avenue, looking toward the west. Photographed in 2007 Atkinson Avenue is an east/west street located in the geographic heart of the city of Detroit, Michigan. The historic district had 225 houses in 2010. Atkinson Avenue was named in honor of William Francis Atkinson. Held prisoner by the Confederacy, Atkinson courageously escaped and rose to the rank of captain before leaving the service in 1886. Captain Atkinson had a commendable war record. Long after the Civil War, he studied law and was admitted to the bar.Atkinson Ave., City of Detroit Planning and Development Department In its entirety, Atkinson Avenue begins at Woodward Avenue and travels westerly to Linwood Avenue, where Atkinson Avenue abruptly stops. Atkinson Avenue resumes at Savery Avenue and continues traveling westerly to its final terminus at McQuade Avenue, just west of Dexter Boulevard. For a time, during the 1890s, that portion of Atkinson Avenue situated between 12th Street and \\"Crawford\\" Street (later renamed \\"Hamilton\\"), actually constituted a part of the boundary of Detroit's city limits. Atkinson Avenue consists of parts of six subdivisions, specifically Joy Farm, Lewis Park, Jackson Park, Voigt Park, Boston Boulevard, and Guerold's Subdivision. The adjacent Boston-Edison Historic District is composed of the same subdivisions. The Atkinson Avenue Historic District, however, only includes those six blocks of Atkinson Avenue situated between the John C. Lodge Expressway and Linwood Avenue. The Atkinson Avenue Historic District, as it exists today, was established by action of the Detroit City Council in March 1984 (Journal City Council 262 66, passed March 7, 1984 and effective March 26, 1984). All remaining portions of Atkinson Avenue are not within the boundaries of any historic district.Council Journal Records, Feb 15th and March 7th 1984 - Introduction and approval of Atkinson Avenue Historic District designation Of those portions not already within the city limits, the remaining land in the vicinity was incorporated into the City of Detroit by 1915. The peak building time for the area was 1915 to 1925, which corresponded to the construction of Henry Ford Hospital--several blocks to the south--in 1915. The neighborhood became a middle-class area of very nice homes. Doctors, poets, ministers, real estate agents, salesmen and a newspaper writer were among the community's first residents.Atkinson Avenue Historic District - City Council Historic Designation - Final Report The first and only Poet Laureate of Michigan,Library of Congress - Michigan's only Poet Laureate Edgar Guest lived at 1500 Atkinson, and one of the thoroughfare's most well-known residents was the renowned baseball player Ty Cobb who resided in a brick dwelling at the intersection of Atkinson and Third (not within the boundaries of the historic district). Each of the aforementioned subdivisions had similar building restrictions. Homes were to be built 30 feet from the front of the lot line and building materials were to be solid brick, stone, cement, stone veneer or stucco. Few dwellings were of wooden frame construction. All residences were to have full basements. Most houses are of the \\"basic box\\" or \\"four square\\" types with Mediterranean, Colonial or Tudor elements and are two stories tall with an attic. If a home had an ornamental fence, it was to be of no more than five feet in height. Cost of construction was also specified to be between $3,000 to $4,000. The majority of homes were to be single-family residences. Unlike other neighborhoods within the city, Atkinson Avenue residents did not file deed restrictions prohibiting non-Caucasians from purchasing homes. History When Atkinson Avenue was first established, it did not prohibit African-Americans and Jewish people from living there, making it one of only a few middle-class areas to allow those groups to live there. In 2010 about 25% of the houses in Atkinson Avenue Historic District were unoccupied and boarded up. Education Detroit Public Schools operates the schools serving Atkinson Avenue district.

It evolved from a project group for international and comparative social law, launched by the Max Planck Society in 1976. Its founding director was Professor Hans F. Zacher. During its early years, the Institute mainly focused on research on the methodology of comparing social laws. Several studies on the social law systems of other states laid the foundations for comparative social law as a subject of research. Current research focuses on social security law in terms of collectively organized social benefits and services provided by the civil polity (cash benefits, benefits in kind and personal services), on fundamental social rights, and on social constitutional law in selected countries.

He notably played in the Football League for Grimsby Town where he started his career, and then Boston United where he was club captain. He has since forged a career in Non-league playing for Alfreton Town, Northwich Victoria, Nuneaton Borough, King's Lynn, Eastwood Town, Harrogate Town, Frickley Athletic, Hall Road Rangers and Bottesford Town. Playing career Grimsby Town Chapman came through the youth ranks with professional club Grimsby Town and signed professionally with The Mariners in 1997. He made his first team debut for the club in a 1‚Äì0 victory over local rivals Hull City in the Football League Trophy in January 1998. He would have to wait another 18 months before he was called up for action again, and made a run out against Watford . Ben was used as the club's reserve left back and was understudy to Tony Gallimore, Chapman only managed 2 appearances in both the 1999-2000 and 2000‚Äì2001 season and would have to wait until the 2001-2002 campaign before he started to have a regular run in first team affairs. Notably that season Chapman played for Grimsby on both Anfield and Highbury as Grimsby recorded a historic cup win over Liverpool before being knocked out by Arsenal. In the Liverpool game, a Grimsby corner resulted in Chapman volleying just close over the crossbar and was Grimsby's only clear cut chance in the first half of play. He would go on to never get on the score sheet for the club. While playing for Grimsby, Chapman was responsible for ending the career of Scunthorpe United midfielder Peter Morrison during a pre season friendly in 2001. The game was abandoned as a result of the injury, and eventually following court proceedings, Morrison was rewarded a ¬£400,000 compensation pay out.http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/low/football/4976850.stm Boston United In July 2002 Grimsby captured Welsh International left back Darren Barnard on a free transfer thus resulting in Chapman's release from the club. He signed for Boston United and became the team's captain, and was able to give his new teammates a helping hand as The Pilgrims avoided relegation from the Third Division. Ben stayed with Boston until the end of the 2003‚Äì2004 season, and after that he was released. Non League After spending a week training with his former club Grimsby and appearing in a pre- season friendly, Ben went on to sign for Non League side Alfreton Town for a season, before linking up Northwich Victoria the following season, in his only season with the Vics he helped the club gain promotion from the Conference North division. He then went on to join Nuneaton Borough for the 2006‚Äì2007 season. In the summer of 2007 Chapman joined King's Lynn. He stayed with The Linnets until March 2009, where he signed for Eastwood Town. Chapman was released two months later following the end of the season, and joined Harrogate Town in October 2009. He went on to play for Frickley Athletic before moving to Hall Road Rangers as well as having two spells with Appleby Frodingham and later playing for Bottesford Town. Chapman remained without a club for the 2012‚Äì13 season but in May 2013 he went on trial with Scarborough Athletic. Coaching career Chapman joined Armthorpe Welfare as a coach in January 2017. A month later he was promoted to assistant manager as well as also registering as a player.http://m.clubwebsite.com/armthorpewelfare/297733/Players/view/2653290/player/#Player2653290 Honours Eastwood Town *Northern Premier League champions: 2008‚Äì09 Grimsby Town *Second Division play-off winner: 1997‚Äì98 *Football League Trophy winner: 1997‚Äì98 Northwich Victoria *Conference North winner: 2005-06 King's Lynn *Southern League Premier Division champions 2007-08 References External links * 1979 births Living people Sportspeople from Scunthorpe Grimsby Town F.C. players Boston United F.C. players Alfreton Town F.C. players Northwich Victoria F.C. players Nuneaton Borough F.C. players King's Lynn F.C. players Eastwood Town F.C. players Harrogate Town A.F.C. players Frickley Athletic F.C. players Appleby Frodingham F.C. players Hall Road Rangers F.C. players Bottesford Town F.C. players English Football League players Association football defenders English footballers ","title":"Ben Chapman (footballer, born 1979)"},{"id":"18805390","text":"Dave Martin is a former American sportscaster who spent seven seasons as a play-by-play announcer in Major League Baseball.

She competed for the United States at the 2008 Olympics. Then, at the age of 38 she competed again for Team USA at the 2012 London Olympics.  Career  Lorig's hometown is Tbilisi, Georgia, where she started her archery training in 6th grade at a state-sponsored school. Her training involved learning how to hold a bow for eight months while looking in the mirror before being able to actually load an arrow. Lorig earned individual bronze and team gold medals at the 1990 European Championships in Barcelona competing for the Soviet Union. She also earned individual and team gold medals at the 1992 European Championships in Malta. When she was 18 and while four months pregnant, Lorig earned a bronze medal in women's team competing for the Unified Team at the 1992 Olympics. Lorig went on to compete for Georgia at the 1996 Olympics. After competing in the 1996 Olympics in the United States, she decided to remain in the US and settled in Brooklyn, NY and later New Jersey. She competed again for Georgia at the 2000 Olympics as Khatuna Lorigi. Lorig became a naturalized U.S. citizen and qualified to compete in the women's individual archery event at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. There Lorig finished her ranking round with a total of 635 points. This gave her the 26th seed for the final competition bracket in which she faced Virginie Arnold in the first round, beating the archer from France with 107-105. In the second round she was too strong for Alison Williamson with 112-109 and via Ana Rend√≥n (107-95) she achieved her place in the quarter final. There she was unable to beat eventual bronze medalist Yun Ok-Hee who won the match with 111-105. She taught actress Jennifer Lawrence how to shoot with a recurve bow for the 2012 film The Hunger Games. In April 2016, she received her first sponsorship deal with a non- archery brand, appearing in a commercial for Bridgestone tires.

The Newcastle Aero Club (NAC) selected a site after careful consideration and began preparations and cleared the land at District Park in 1928, to create a grassed runway. The first aircraft to land at the aerodrome was an Avro 504K, registered as VH- UBC, on 4 September 1929, which had Newcastle's Own painted on one side of the tail rudder and Spirit of Newcastle painted on the other side. The first Tiger Moth in Australia delivered on 2 June 1935, registered as VH-UTD and named Halycon, was kept at the aerodrome by the NAC. Early pioneering aviators Charles Kingsford Smith, Jean Batten and Bert Hinkler visited the aerodrome during their flights up and down the east coast of Australia. During World War II, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) utilised the aerodrome as a satellite aerodrome to RAAF Williamtown. The NAC workshops over-hauled RAAF trainers and manufactured wooden wing-tips for the Mosquito fighter bomber. The aerodrome was also utilised by PBY Catalina, Supermarine Walrus and Dakotas. After the war ended the NAC purchased a Bellman Hangar from the RAAF and erected it on-site next to its main hangar. In 1953, the Newcastle Aero Club became the Royal Newcastle Aero Club, with permission granted by Queen Elizabeth II. During the 1950s the Club was given notice by the Department of Civil Aviation to relocate from the field at Broadmeadow because the area had become built-up and high television antennae on the perimeter of the field interfered with landing approaches. In 1963, the Club transferred its operations from Broadmeadow to its present airport at Rutherford, Maitland.

More delicate fiberglass or composite slalom boats can be carried down the steps.Midpoint of the 900-foot-long course. The Dickerson Whitewater Course, on the Potomac River near Dickerson, Maryland, was built for use by canoe and kayak paddlers training for the 1992 Olympic Games in Spain. It was the first pump-powered artificial whitewater course built in North America, and is still the only one anywhere with heated water. It remains an active training center for whitewater slalom racing, swiftwater rescue training, and other whitewater activities. The facility is owned by the NRG Energy company. Except during special events, access requires membership in the Potomac Whitewater Racing Center, a USA Canoe/Kayak National Training Center.Potomac Whitewater Racing Center Cards are issued by the Liquid Adventures Kayak School. The course was constructed in 1991, inside a pre-existing straight, -long concrete channel, wide. Since 1959, the channel has returned cooling water from the Dickerson Generating Station to the Potomac River, upstream from Washington, D.C. Water is pumped from the river, warmed as much as 35 ¬∞F (20 ¬∞C) as it cools the power plant's three coal-fired generators, and then emptied into the channel for gravity flow back to the river.Davey Hearn, Dickerson Whitewater Course (The plant has three other generators which use a different cooling system.)

History In the 1960s, local canoe and kayak paddlers began conducting winter practice in the heated Potomac River water immediately below the discharge channel. Nearly three decades went by before paddler Scott Wilkinson got the idea of moving the practice up into the concrete-lined channel itself. In 1991, he sold his idea to two of the power plant managers, and, in support of the 1992 Olympics team, the Potomac Electric Power Company, Pepco, which owned the plant at the time, approved the insertion of approximately 75 artificial concrete boulders and two wing dams into the channel. Wilkinson's fellow paddler John Anderson, an architect, built a 1:12 scale model with flow-diversion features similar to those in the Segre Olympic Park artificial course in La Seu d'Urgell, Spain, built for the 1992 games. The model was tested at the Navy's David Taylor Model Basin. Construction companies building combustion turbine units on (and for) the Pepco Site, donated time and equipment, and the course was opened in December 1991. The first race was held in June 1992. Athletes who trained at the Dickerson course won bronze and gold medals in the 1992 Olympics, and others have continued to win Olympic medals and world championships in subsequent years. The course was redesigned in the fall of 2002, once again by John Anderson. A new scale model was built, this one outdoors and onsite. After testing his new arrangement of flow-diversion features on the model, he specified new locations for some of the artificial boulders. The wing dam on the left side was moved downstream into section four. A crane was deployed for the moving job. In October 2003 a persistent problem at the end of the course was fixed. Whenever the Potomac River level is below on the Little Falls gauge , there is a sheer drop between the end of the concrete channel and the river. In certain conditions of high course flow and low river level, a stream-wide retentive hydraulic, or \\"sticky hole,\\" posed a hazard to paddlers who failed to correctly \\"boof stroke\\" across the drop. It was a worse problem for paddlers who had made a wet exit from an upside-down boat and were swimming the course. This feature was modified by adding a concrete slab under the drop and two trapezoid-shaped diverters on the sides. The hydraulic was converted into a central tongue of water ending in a wave train, with an eddy on each side. Present course design The course has four sections, connected in a straight line, end-to-end, with a drop at the end of each section. A final section ends in the river, with or without a drop, depending on the river level. Overall slope adds another seven feet of drop, for a total course drop of 15 feet (4.6 m), plus zero to four feet (0 to 1.2 meters) into the river at the end. The following map shows the arrangement of the visible and submerged features. center To use the course without a certified instructor present, a paddler must pass a \\"blue card\\" test: namely, pause in each of the numbered eddies, in sequence, and roll in the current, not in an eddy, between eddies 1 and 5 at the top, and again between eddies 1 and 5 at the bottom. During the blue card test, the course must be running near full flow, , and the river must be low enough that there is a significant drop from the bottom of the course into the river. Unique features of the course Because the water channel was designed for an industrial, rather than a recreational, function, there are no wide pools to serve as resting spots, and there is no easy way off the water, short of the end. The water is deceptively fast, and all but two of the eddies have swirling water with an upstream component. From the river, paddlers must carry their boats the length of the course to re-enter and make another run. There are two other artificial whitewater courses in the mid-Atlantic region: in Charlotte, NC, and McHenry, MD. The Charlotte course, U.S. National Whitewater Center, USNWC, opened in 2006, and the McHenry course, Adventure Sports Center International, ASCI, opened in 2007. They do not have heated water. The Dickerson Power Plant operates at a fraction of what it did 10 years ago, so the heated water is decreased accordingly. They both feature circular water channels with conveyor belt lifts from the course end to the beginning, plus bigger drops, wider eddies, mid-course pools, and guided raft trips for tourists. Dickerson is for decked, hard-shell boats only. All three facilities are used for canoe and kayak training and as venues for competitions. Gallery Image:Dickerson-C1a.jpgSlalom Practice.

It is a perfect totient number. It follows 4,294,967,294 and precedes 4,294,967,296. It has a factorization of 3 \\\\cdot 5 \\\\cdot 17 \\\\cdot 257 \\\\cdot 65537.  In geometry  Since the prime factors of 2 ‚àí 1 are exactly the five known Fermat primes, this number is the largest known odd value n for which a regular n-sided polygon is constructible using compass and straightedge. Equivalently, it is the largest known odd number n for which the angle 2\\\\pi/n can be constructed, or for which \\\\cos(2\\\\pi/n) can be expressed in terms of square roots. Not only is 4,294,967,295 the largest known odd number of sides of a constructible polygon, but since constructibility is related to factorization, the list of odd numbers n for which an n-sided polygon is constructible begins with the list of factors of 4,294,967,295. If there are no more Fermat primes, then the two lists are identical. Namely (assuming 65537 is the largest Fermat prime), an odd-sided polygon is constructible if and only if it has 3, 5, 15, 17, 51, 85, 255, 257, 771, 1285, 3855, 4369, 13107, 21845, 65535, 65537, 196611, 327685, 983055, 1114129, 3342387, 5570645, 16711935, 16843009, 50529027, 84215045, 252645135, 286331153, 858993459, 1431655765, or 4294967295 sides. If there are more numbers in this list, they must be at least 2+1 (approximately 10), because every intervening Fermat number is known to be composite.  In computing  The number 4,294,967,295, equivalent to the hexadecimal value , is the maximum value for a 32-bit unsigned integer in computing. It is therefore the maximum value for a variable declared as an unsigned integer (usually indicated by the codeword) in many programming languages running on modern computers. The presence of the value may reflect an error, overflow condition, or missing value. This value is also the largest memory address for CPUs using a 32-bit address bus. Being an odd value, its appearance may reflect an erroneous (misaligned) memory address. Such a value may also be used as a sentinel value to initialize newly allocated memory for debugging purposes. In 2004, 800 aircraft over Los Angeles were put in danger when the LA Air Route Traffic Control Center lost radio contact with all of the aircraft for about three hours, delaying 400 flights and cancelling 600, due to a computer design that kept time by starting at 4,294,967.295 seconds and counting down to zero, or 49 days, 17 hours, 2 minutes and 47.295 seconds.

Started in November 2005, the setup was established and maintained by Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology. NEFT enables bank customers in India to transfer funds between any two NEFT-enabled bank accounts on a one-to-one basis. It is done via electronic messages. Unlike real-time gross settlement, fund transfers through the NEFT system do not occur in real-time basis. NEFT settles fund transfers in hourly batches with 23 settlements occurring between 00:30 hrs. to 00:00 hrs. From December 16, 2019, there would be 48 half-hourly batches occurring between 00.30 am to 00:00 am every day regardless of a holiday or otherwise, As of November 30, 2019, NEFT facilities were available at 1,48,477 branches/offices of 216 banks across the country and online through the website of NEFT-enabled banks. NEFT has gained popularity due to the ease and efficiency with which the transactions can be concluded. There is no limit ‚Äì either minimum or maximum ‚Äì on the amount of funds that can be transferred using NEFT. Process Detailed process of NEFT is as follows: # The customer fills an application form providing details of the beneficiary (like name, bank, branch name, IFSC, account type and account number) and the amount to be remitted. The remitter authorizes his/her bank branch to debit his account and remit the specified amount to the beneficiary. This facility is also available through online banking, and some banks also offer the NEFT facility through ATMs. # The originating bank branch prepares a message and sends the message to its pooling centre (also called the NEFT Service Centre). # The pooling centre forwards the message to the NEFT Clearing Centre (operated by National Clearing Cell, Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai) to be included for the next available batch. # The Clearing Centre sorts the funds transfer transactions destination bank-wise and prepares accounting entries to receive funds from the originating banks (debit) and give the funds to the destination banks (credit). Thereafter, bank-wise remittance messages are forwarded to the destination banks through their pooling centre (NEFT Service Centre). # The destination banks receive the inward remittance messages from the Clearing Centre and pass on the credit to the beneficiary customers‚Äô accounts. Settlement timings NEFT transfers are settled in half-hourly batches every day between 00:30 am and 00:00 am all through the year. NEFT originally settled fund transfers in hourly batches. The RBI reduced clearance times to half-hourly batches in April 2016. In August 2019, the RBI announced that it would enable round-the-clock settlements from 16 December 2019.  Service charges for NEFT transactions  The structure of charges is as follows: Inward transactions at destination bank branches (for credit to beneficiary accounts): * Free, no charges to be collected from beneficiaries Outward transactions at originating bank branches (charges for the remitter): * Free, the RBI announced on 11 June 2019 that all charges for NEFT and real- time gross settlement collected from banks would be waived from 1 July 2019, and asked banks to pass on the benefits to customers. Statistics 216.71 million National Electronic Funds Transfers transactions worth were made in September 2019, as against 661 million transactions worth the entire year 2013-15.

Today, however, he is most famous as the man who commissioned the Palais Stoclet, a mansion in Brussels, Belgium, between 1907 and 1911. Life Stoclet was born into a family of Belgian bankers in Saint-Gilles, Belgium on 30 September 1871.Henri Lavachery, \\"Adolphe Stoclet\\", Biographie Nationale de Belgique, vol. 33 (Brussels, 1965), 675-681. After studying civil engineering at Brussels University, he was employed by Italian and Austrian railway companies from 1894 onwards. He returned to Belgium in 1904 and began working for the Compagnie Internationale de Chemins de Fer, becoming chairman in 1927. His wife, Suzanne, was a niece of the painter Alfred Stevens, and daughter of the art historian Alfred Stevens. They had two sons, xx b. xx and Jacques b. 1906, and one daughter, Annie, b. 1908. Stoclet was described by contemporaries as charming, but somewhat pompous, and had a large beard said to resemble that of the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal. After his father's death, Stoclet became one of the directors of the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale de Belgique, which for many years was one of the largest holding companies in Belgium and owned about forty different enterprises, including banks, arms factories, and mines in the Belgian Congo. Banque d'Outremer, an affiliate of the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale de Banque, had its office in rue Brederode. Stoclet had his own office there refurbished by architect Josef Hoffmann. While in Vienna to oversee the construction of a railroad, Stoclet met one of the masters of the Vienna Secession (and later, the Wiener Werkst√§tte), the architect Josef Hoffmann. Stoclet shared Hoffmann's avant-garde artistic inclinations, and commissioned the latter to build him his own villa. While Stoclet initially considered building the house in Vienna, eventually he settled on a site in Brussels. The architect received not only artistic license for the design, but also an unlimited budget. Hoffmann left much of the interior decoration for the Palais Stoclet to the painters Gustav Klimt and Fernand Khnopff. Madame Stoclet apparently coordinated the colors of the flowers in the vases with the ties Stoclet wore. The Palais Stoclet is situated at 279-81 avenue de Tervuren in Brussels. Stoclet resided there until his death in Woluwe-Saint-Pierre on 3 November 1949. His wife died a fortnight later, and their art collection was divided between their three children. The Palais Stoclet is still occupied by their heirs.

Their families had been associated for decades. Despite her father's concerns that the financially struggling Took was only interested in marrying her for her money, the couple wed on 12 July 1983 and lived in Cleary's affluent Chelsea, London home. The extended family from Cleary's first marriage consisted of a son, two daughters and eight grandchildren. With both of Cleary's daughters in school in other countries, her teenage son was the only child residing with the couple. Cleary was \\"touched\\" by the attention paid to her son by Took, who had repeatedly made it clear that he wanted no children of his own. The couple separated in the late 1980s as a result of Took's infidelity. They later reunited, but split again after Cleary found evidence of another affair. Although she had filed for divorce, the couple again reconciled, in part because Cleary feared her husband might commit suicide if she didn't give their marriage another chance‚Äîhe had attempted suicide over rejection from a woman in his youth, leaving deep scars on his neck and wrists‚Äîand she had always considered him to be a \\"fragile\\" man. He spent much of the following years travelling in Russia. Child sexual abuse case and death In February 2007, their 25th year of marriage, Roger Took joined his family for a trip to the Dominican Republic. On their way home, one of his stepdaughters found a $100 bill in her daughter's luggage. The girl said that Took gave it to her so that he could photograph her. After additional questioning by her mother, she explained that she had been sexually abused by Took \\"for as long as she could remember\\".Metcalf, p. 5. The mother alerted the police and a six-week investigation was launched during which Took was unaware that his family knew what had been happening. Took was arrested at Luton airport in April 2007 following a police investigation that uncovered 742 chat room logs in which Took boasted about a child rape and murder. Took denied the allegations, saying his words were merely a fantasy. Police also recovered 260 images from Took's laptop. 102 of them were graded as \\"level 5s\\", meaning they depicted children being penetrated, tortured or both.Metcalf, p. 2. Police raided Took's home where they found a locked case, which contained a large bundle of photographs of young Russian women. The women, who were naked and one of whom was having sex with Took, are believed to be prostitutes. Also found in the case were clippings of children's hair.Metcalf, p. 1. Took was given an indeterminate sentence by Judge Henry Blacksell QC who believed he \\"posed a danger to all children.\\" He eventually pleaded guilty to a total of 17 charges, including sexual assault on a child under 13, inciting a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity and making and possessing indecent images of children.Global News Feeds (15 February 2008). \\"Wealthy Academic Locked Up For Child Abuse\\". bignewsday.com. Archived from the original on 22 February 2008. Judge Blacksell had reviewed thousands of pages of evidence, and was visibly shocked when he told the court, \\"It is unrestrained filth, depravity of the worst kind.\\" He was sentenced to nine years, but was eligible for parole after four and a half. He was also banned from working with children under the age of 18 for the rest of his life. Took appealed against his sentence. According to Charlotte Metcalf, Took's charm, social status, academic reputation and credentials served to \\"cushion him from condemnation\\".Metcalf, p. 8. His case received little publicity and he enjoyed support from former colleagues. During sentencing Judge Blacksell, who stated that he had no doubt that Took suffered from an illness, took into consideration 23 letters of support and three character witnesses who spoke at the hearing on behalf of five people.

A thousand MILF rebels under the command of Umbra Kato seized control of thirty-five villages in the North Cotabato. Two thousand Philippine troops with helicopters and artillery were sent to the seized area on August 9 to liberate it from the rebels. The MILF had wanted North Cotabato to be included in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). The Filipino government and MILF had been negotiating for the inclusion of the province, but the Supreme Court of the Philippines had struck down the proposal after hearing concern from local Christian leaders in the region. The rebel troops were ordered to leave the area by their commanders, but the contingents under Kato refused to leave the villages they had occupied. The Philippine Army responded on August 9 by bombarding them. The next day, the government forces moved to retake the villages, recapturing two of them from the rebels.

The firm's headquarters are located in London, and also has offices in New York, Sydney, Australia and Princeton, New Jersey. Caxton Associates identifies investments according to their research of global markets and analysis of worldwide economic trends. Caxton Associates went through a major generational transition in 2008 when Bruce Kovner stepped back from trading and appointed Andrew Law as Chief Investment Officer. In 2011, Law was appointed as the Chairman, CEO and controlling general partner of Caxton Associates, following the retirement of Kovner. The firm manages $3.7 billion in assets. History Caxton was founded in 1983 by Bruce Kovner. Kovner trained under Michael Marcus at Commodities Corporation (now part of Goldman Sachs International), before embarking on his own with the founding of Caxton. In 1992, Caxton closed its fund to new investors. The fund then opened and closed intermittently, and most recently reopened to new investors in August 2013. It was reported that at the end of the 1990s Caxton Global Investments volatility fell substantially along with the funds returns. In 2003 concern at Caxton Associates around the potential future impact on their historical rate of return due to their fund's size resulted in 20 percent of investors' capital being returned. Assets under management post 20% were $9.5 billion. On December 21, 2007, Caxton-Iseman Capital, a joint investment partnership Caxton Associates and Frederick Iseman announced that it had completed its spin-off from Caxton Associates. Caxton-Iseman Capital will change its name to CI Capital Partners LLC.Caxton-Iseman Capital Announces Spin-Off From Caxton Associates In 2008, Bruce Kovner stepped back from trading and appointed Andrew Law as Caxton‚Äôs Chief Investment Officer. In 2011, Law was appointed as the Chairman, CEO and controlling general partner of Caxton Associates, following the retirement of Kovner. Law joined the London office in 2003 from Goldman Sachs, where he was Managing Director and head of FICC proprietary trading in London. 2008 Financial Crisis During the 2008 financial crisis Caxton Associates did not erect gates freezing investor capital in their Caxton Global Investments fund. As reported the fund saw client redemptions totalling 27% of assets under management through 2008‚Äì2009‚Äîwhile returning 13% for the year. The redemptions were reportedly born out of cash strapped clients many of whose asset allocations were gated and frozen at other investment management companies: two years later the firm had fallen from No. 16 to No. 51. In 2010 it was reported that since 1983 Caxton Associates had returned $12.8 billion to clients whilst managing $6 billion; ranking second amongst managers who have returned more than they currently manage. Company Caxton Associates' offices are in New York, London's Mayfair district, Sydney, Princeton, NJ and Singapore. In July 2019 it was reported its London office was now its headquarters. Investments  Caxton Associates is a global macro hedge fund and has made more than $13bn for its clients - according to LCH Investments - this is roughly 14 per cent annually, with half the volatility of the S&P; 500. According to an interview with Andrew Law in the Financial Times in October 2013, Caxton has ‚Äúthree core principles‚Äù: ‚ÄúOne is listen to the markets, a second one is politics and policy matters and the third one is risk control.‚Äù Investment vehicles The firm's flagship fund was reported in August 2011 to account for $7 billion of Caxton Associates assets under management.

It was made into an audio and a video version. In the story, two children Tim and Rose, looking for their lost cow Lucy, meet magical enchanted forest characters. They are captured by Badjelly the witch, then rescued by an eagle. God intervenes as they escape, and the witch is destroyed when she attempts to \\"scratch God's eye out\\". The characters enchanted by Badjelly are rescued. In 1975, in the planning for an audio version for the BBC \\"infant's programme\\" Let's Join In, Milligan objected to the planned removal of God from the story. The BBC wrote in a letter that the object was not to put God on the same level as goblins, to which Milligan replied that goblins, fairies and God all exist. However, he allowed God to be removed.Norma Farnes, The Compulsive Spike Milligan, Fourth Estate 2004 In 1974 Ed Welch set Badjelly the Witch to music and the LP was released on Polydor Records. Milligan narrated it with a large orchestra, and the LP was a reasonable success. In New Zealand, where it was regularly played on morning radio, it was a huge success and has sold over 40000 recordings up to 2012. Film In 2000, CBBC and Ragdoll Productions had collaborated on a film based on the book and aired on Christmas Day. Spike Milligan, the book's writer, narrated the movie. Milligan also wrote and starred as himself. The characters in the film were all voiced by Spike, while Tim & Rose were voiced by child actors Sarah Wichall and Jake Dudley. Theatre Alannah O'Sullivan's 1977 adaptation of Badjelly the Witch is the most licensed New Zealand Play. It was first professionally produced by Company Theatre, Taurangahttp://tadb.otago.ac.nz and has had over 100 productions throughout New Zealand. Playmarket published the script in their New Zealand Theatrescripts series edited by David Carnegie.Playmarket New Zealand theatrescripts. In 2010, 2016, and 2018 Tim Bray Productions presented its version of 'Badjelly the Witch' on stage at The PumpHouse Theatre, Takapuna, Auckland, New Zealand. Tim Bray adapted and directed the book into a stage play and included The Goons' 'Ying Tong' song along with Monty Pythonesque comedy. The script is available through Playmarket, New Zealand's script agency. Both seasons were hugely successful. In 2010/11, there was a production created by the Chickenshed Theatre Company called Badjelly's Bad Christmas, with Badjelly the Witch, along with many other characters created by Milligan such as Sir Nobonk and King Twytt, as the main characters.

August 31, 1931), also known as O-kuh-ha-tuh and Making Medicine, was a Cheyenne Indian warrior and spiritual leader, who became an artist and Episcopal deacon. Imprisoned in 1875 after the Indian Wars at Fort Marion (now Castillo de San Marcos), Florida, Oakerhater became one of the founding figures of modern Native American art. Later he was ordained as a deacon in the Episcopal Church in the United States of America and worked as a missionary in Oklahoma. In 1985, Oakerhater was the first Native American Anglican to be included in the book of Lesser Feasts and Fasts of the Episcopal Church. Early life Born in the 1840s in the Indian Territory (later the U.S. state of Oklahoma) to Sleeping Wolf (father), and Wah Nach (mother), Oakerhater was the second of three boys. His childhood name was Noksowist (\\"Bear Going Straight\\"), and he was raised as a traditional Cheyenne. His older brother was Little Medicine, and his younger brother was Wolf Tongue. Oakerhater is believed by some to have been the youngest man to complete the sun dance ritual (his Cheyenne name, Okuh hatuh, means \\"sun dancer\\"). He participated in his first war party (military raid) at age 14 against the Otoe and Missouri tribes, and became a member of his tribe's \\"Bowstring Society\\" (one of five military societies). He later participated in actions against United States federal and state militia forces. His first engagement with white settlers was at the Second Battle of Adobe Walls, in which 300 Native American warriors from various tribes, angered by settlers' poaching of buffalo, cattle grazing, and theft of horses, attacked a small trading village used by poachers. The battle, led by Comanche leader Isa-tai and Chief Quanah Parker, triggered United States government response in the form of the Red River War of 1874‚Äì75. Oakerhater may also have participated in the Battle of Washita River and the Sand Creek massacre. Oakerhater married Nomee (translated as \\"Thunder Woman\\") in 1872. She died in 1880. They had four children, all of whom died young. Oakerhater also married, had at least one child, and divorced, a second woman, Nanessan (\\"Taking Off Dress\\"). Fort Marion prisoner The courtyard at Fort Marion In the Red River War of 1874 and 1875, the United States government attempted to pacify Native American warriors on the Southern Plains, fighting a series of skirmishes until the militants were exhausted by lack of food and supplies. The warriors, including Oakerhater, surrendered in 1875 at Fort Sill near what is now Lawton, Oklahoma. A group of 74 were selected from there and another location, all without trial, for imprisonment in Florida. Oakerhater was in a group chosen for being the eighteen farthest right in a line-up by a US Army colonel who had been drinking and was running out of time before nightfall. Some among the eighteen had nothing to do with the insurrection. The army assigned First Lieutenant (later Captain) Richard Henry Pratt to transport the prisoners to an old Spanish fort, the Castillo de San Marcos (then known as Fort Marion), near Saint Augustine. Shackled together, they were taken across country on foot, by wagon, train (most had never before seen a train), and steamboat. Many initially thought they would be executed. At least two attempted suicide; one was later shot and killed attempting to escape, and another died of pneumonia. Captain Pratt supported assimilation of American Indians into European-American mainstream society. He thought they needed to abandon their cultures and religions and learn the various practices of America's dominant white culture to survive: English, wage work, Christianity, literacy, mainstream education, and so on. The practice of forced assimilation, now criticized as cultural genocide, was considered progressive by its practitioners of the time. Many European-Americans considered Native Americans to be enemies and murderers who should be killed, imprisoned, or defeated through force. Pratt's superior, General Philip Sheridan, dismissed Pratt's beliefs as \\"Indian twaddle\\". Conditions at the old fort were initially very poor: prisoners slept on the floor of their cells facing a central open-air courtyard. Several died in the first weeks. Pratt quickly improved conditions, obtaining army uniforms, removing the prisoners' shackles, setting them to work building a new residential shed, and procuring bedding. Later, as trust developed on both sides, Pratt convinced his superiors to allow the Indians to carry nonoperational rifles, perform guard duty, obtain outside employment collecting and selling sea beans and other tourist items, have passes to visit the town on Sundays to attend church, and camp unsupervised on nearby Anastasia Island. Pratt, who offered to resign his military post if the experiment failed, appointed Oakerhater First Sergeant of the prisoners, with a duty to organize morning military drills, ensure hygiene and dress code, choose assistants for Captain Pratt, and oversee the prisoners in Pratt's absence. Pratt and his wife also arranged for volunteer teachers who were vacationing in Florida from across the United States to instruct the prisoners in English, carpentry, and other subjects. They allowed the Indians to conduct a mock buffalo hunt. In return the prisoners educated townspeople and tourists in archery, and made handicrafts and drawings to sell. Aware for their part of the nature of Pratt's experiment, the prisoners took pride in their work and martial discipline, eager to demonstrate that they could master white Americans' cultural and military practices. They took longer to overcome other cultural barriers, such as discomfort with being taught by women. The first summer Pratt arranged for their families to visit them from the Indian Territory. Within two years of arrival at Fort Marion, Oakerhater was proficient in English, and was regularly writing letters to townspeople he had befriended. That year nineteen of the prisoners were released, in exchange for accepting scholarships for education on the East Coast. Ledger art Self- portrait with horse, ca. 1875 One of Pratt's experiments was to provide art supplies and instruction to the prisoners. They drew most of their art in pen in ledger books. Somewhat abstract in style and depicting nostalgic memories of scenes from daily life, their art drew inspiration from earlier Plains Indian hide painting, which included personal narratives and winter counts, calendar chronicles of tribal events. Typical subjects included community dances, hunts, courting, and events at the fort, as well as self-portraits depicting scenes before their imprisonment. The ledger art was a popular item for tourists to purchase. Through his art, Oakerhater gained the attention of Mrs. Alice Key Pendleton, to whose daughter he had given one of his drawing books. Oakerhater was the first and one of the most prolific, artists in the group. Oakerhater's drawings are considered by critics to be sophisticated in composition and subject content. These artworks are highly collectible today. He often signed his works \\"Making Medicine,\\" a non-literal English translation of his Cheyenne name, Sun Dancer, which the military had assigned him upon his arrest. Other times he would sign with a glyph of a dancer in a sun dance lodge to represent himself. The Smithsonian Institution has a collection of the Fort Marion artists online.\\"Fort Marion Artists\\" , Smithsonian Institution, accessed 4 Dec 2008 Episcopal affiliation In 1877 an Episcopal deaconess, Mary Douglass Burnham, began to make arrangements to sponsor the remaining prisoners, including Oakerhater, to serve as church sextons and continue education. In April 1878 all of the prisoners were released. Burnham arranged funding from Alice Key Pendleton and her husband, Senator George H. Pendleton, to bring Oakerhater, as well as his wife Nomee, to St. Paul's Church in Paris Hill, New York, along with three other ex- prisoners who each had separate sponsors. The church's priest, the Reverend J.B. Wicks, took charge of Oakerhater's education on matters of agriculture, Scripture, and current events, and welcomed him as part of his family. Oakerhater, along with his three companions from Fort Marion, became popular among townspeople. They made and sold various items, including handmade bows. Within six months Oakerhater agreed to be baptized and was confirmed shortly after. He chose the biblical Christian name David and adopted the last name Pendleton in honor of his sponsors. In 1878, Oakerhater was baptized at Grace Episcopal Church in Syracuse and ordained a deacon at that same church in 1881. Captain Pratt, encouraged by the success of his former prisoners at Paris Hill and some at Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute for Negroes (now Hampton University), lobbied the federal government for funds to open schools for Indian children. Senator Pendleton pushed a bill through Congress to found the first school in 1879 at the unused Carlisle Barracks in central Pennsylvania. It was named the Carlisle Indian Industrial School. thumb Prior to the 2005 celebration at Grace Church in Syracuse, NY, O-kuh-ha-tah descendants (great-great grandson, Jack Southmeth; granddaughter Elizabeth Whiteshield; great-granddaughter Kim Whiteshield; and great-great granddaughter Star Whiteshield) travelled to St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Paris Hill (near Utica) to visit O-kuh-ha-tah's home church and the graves of their ancestors. In July, 1880 Nomee died in childbirth. The next year Oakerhater's young son Pawwahnee died. Both were buried in the cemetery in Paris Hill. Oakerhater was ordained an Episcopal deacon in July, 1881. According to sources, O-kuh-ha-tah's son, Frederick; wife, Millie; and another child, who died at birth, are buried in the church cemetery in Paris Hill, New York. Missionary Oakerhater (right) as a missionary in Oklahoma After Oakerhater was ordained a deacon, Pratt sent him on a trip to Indian Territory and Dakota Territory to recruit students for Carlisle, where Pratt had been appointed superintendent. Traveling with Wicks to the Darlington Agency near what is now El Reno, Oklahoma, Oakerhater used his connections and influence to encourage local Cheyenne to attend Episcopal religious services. Remaining in the area, he traveled to the Anadarko Agency (near present-day Anadarko, Oklahoma) for Sunday services, spending weekdays visiting and caring for ill members of various tribes. In 1882 Oakerhater married Nahepo (Smoking Woman), who adopted the English name Susie Pendleton. They had two children, who both died young. Nahepo died in 1890, at age 23. In 1887 Oakerhater began work at newly built missions in Bridgeport, and in 1889 at the Whirlwind Mission near Fay, seventeen miles west of Watonga, Oklahoma. The mission, built in 1887, was on the Dawes Act allotment land of Chief Whirlwind, one of the negotiators of the Treaty of Medicine Lodge. As at other Indian schools being established in the United States, many of Whirlwind's students suffered from poverty and related diseases. Many suffered from trachoma and conjunctivitis. Their parents, whose lives had been disrupted by colonialism, warfare, forcible relocation, and the breaking up of tribal lands for allotment, were exploited by local non-Indians who wanted to profit from their newly assigned land grants. Uprooted, the families would often camp out near the schools to be with their children and provide a safer environment. Oakerhater's school and mission were under pressure both from locals, who saw the mission as a threat to their attempts to exploit the Native American population, and from others at the local and national level, who deplored the poor conditions there. Oakerhater retired from Whilrwind with a pension in 1918 but continued to preach, serving as a Native American chief and holy man. He moved briefly to Clinton, Oklahoma and then to Watonga, where he lived until his death in 1931. Saint Oakerhater Window, St. Paul's Cathedral, by Preston Singletary After Oakerhater died, the Episcopal Church did not sponsor significant mission work in Watonga, Oklahoma for more than thirty years. In the early 1960s, an Episcopalian family that had moved to the area placed an ad in a local paper to announce a meeting in their home. Native Americans who had known Oakerhater met with the family and worked with them to revive his old mission. In 1985 the Episcopal Church designated Oakerhater as a saint, thanks in part to the years of work and research by Lois Carter Clark, a Muscogee Creek scholar.Anderson, Cokie G. \\"From Warrior to Saint: The Journey of St. David Pendleton Oakerhater\\", Oklahoma State Digital Library. 2006 (retrieved 26 Jan 09) On September 1, 1986, the first feast was held in his honor at the Washington National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., with his descendants and delegations from Oklahoma invited to the celebration. In 2000 the Saint George Church of Dayton, Ohio dedicated a large stained glass window in its chapel depicting Oakerhater, and a smaller window bearing his glyph signature. St. Paul's Cathedral in Oklahoma City dedicated a chapel to St. Oakerhater. The congregation of St. Paul's commissioned Tlingit glass artist, Preston Singletary, to create a stained glass window featuring Oakerhater's glyph. It replaced a church window destroyed in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. The Oakerhater Guild of St. Paul's was organized in partnership with Whirlwind Mission of the Holy Family and sponsors dances, tribal outreach, and a vacation Bible school for children in Watonga.\\"St. Oakerhater Guild.\\" St. Paul's Cathedral. 2009 (retrieved 26 Jan 09) In 2003 the Whirlwind Church obtained at a new permanent site in Watonga, where it dedicated the Oakerhater Episcopal Center in September 2007. The site is used for powwows, a sweat lodge, classes, and an annual Cherokee Dance in Oakerhater's honor. Saint O-kuh-ha-tah memorial stained glass windows at Grace Episcopal Church, Syracuse, NY.

On Saturday, April 16, 2005, a Native American Celebration was held there to honor Cheyenne Saint David Pendleton Oakerhater (O-kuh-ha-tah/Making Medicine), the first Native American saint of the Episcopal Church, and Oneida Marcia Pierce Steele, teacher of both Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) cultural traditions and Christian beliefs. Grace Church's celebration included a day-long cultural festival, followed by holy eucharist and a blessing of new memorial stained-glass windows. Roberta Whiteshield-Butler, great-granddaughter of O-kuh-ha-tah, created the drawings for the windows. Rose Viviano of Rose Colored Glass fabricated the windows which were installed in September 2004 and blessed by Bishop Adams at the April 2005 celebration. Saint O-kuh-ha-tah's descendants travelled from Oklahoma and Texas to attend the celebration at Grace Episcopal Church in Syracuse, New York. Prior to the celebration, O-kuh-ha-tah descendants (great- great grandson, Jack Southmeth; granddaughter Elizabeth Whiteshield; great- granddaughter Kim Whiteshield; and great-great granddaughter Starr Whiteshield) travelled to St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Paris Hill (near Utica) to visit O-kuh-ha-tah's home church and the graves of their ancestors. thumb The April 16, 2005 O-kuh-ha-tah service at Grace Episcopal Church in Syracuse, NY began in the Welsh Garden and was led by the Rev.

He is remembered for his daring escape from the penal colony with his wife, two small children and seven convicts in the governor's cutter, sailing to Timor in a voyage that would come to rank alongside that of fellow Cornishman William Bligh as one of the most incredible ever made in an open boat.Cook 1993, 3 Convict Little is known about Bryant's life before his appearance at Launceston assizes in March 1784. He is believed to be the William Bryant who was baptised in the church of St Uny, in the village of Lelant near St Ives, Cornwall, to parents William and Jane, in April 1757. Bryant worked, like the rest of his family, as a fisherman and mariner, but also became involved in smuggling and other illegal activities. In December 1783 he was apprehended at Bodmin and committed by the Mayor of St Ives for impersonating two Royal Navy seamen in order to obtain their wages. At the March assizes in Launceston he was sentenced to death, a sentence which was commuted to seven years' transportation. He was taken to the prison hulk Dunkirk at Plymouth. His age at that time was given as 26.Gillen 1989, 57 Prison hulks at Portsmouth Following the American War of Independence it was no longer possible to transport convicts to colonies in America and prisoners sentenced to transportation were held on the prison hulks while the government decided on a new destination. Bryant was to serve 3 years of his sentence on the Dunkirk before departing for Australia on the first fleet of ships taking convicts to Botany Bay. During these three years on the hulk he was described as behaving \\"remarkably well\\". The Dunkirk held women convicts as well as men, and in March 1786 Bryant's future wife Mary Broad arrived on board. Mary Broad, who was a fisherman's daughter from Fowey in Cornwall but lived in Plymouth, had been convicted of highway robbery at the Lent Assizes at Exeter and sentenced to death. Reprieved, she was then sentenced to seven years' transportation \\"beyond the seas\\". Also with the prisoners from Exeter was James Martin who was to join the Bryants on their escape attempt. Martin's behaviour on the Dunkirk was described as \\"tolerably decent and orderly\\".Gillen 1989, 238‚Äì9 On the Dunkirk the quarters of the men and women were separated by an iron grille and it is unlikely that Bryant was the father of Mary Broad's first child, Charlotte, who was born on the voyage to Australia. More probably Charlotte resulted from a relationship with a gaoler or marine, although unusually for a child born to a transported woman the name of her father was not registered.Cook 1993, 56‚Äì7 Another convict who would eventually form part of the escape party was James Cox. He arrived on the Dunkirk aged 24, already the veteran on one escape attempt. He had been sentenced to death at the Old Bailey for theft from a haberdashers, reprieved and sentenced to transportation. He had escaped from the Mercury, bound for Canada, when bad weather had forced the ship to put into Torbay and the convicts had overpowered the crew. Recaptured, he had again been sentenced to death and again reprieved. On the Dunkirk he was described as behaving \\"remarkably well\\".Gillen 1989, 84 Transportation On 13 May 1787 the First Fleet set sail for Australia. Bryant, together with James Martin, James Cox and Mary Broad, was on the Charlotte. The voyage to Australia, via the Canary Islands, Brazil, and the Cape of Good Hope, took eight months. On the way Mary Broad gave birth to a daughter, named Charlotte after the ship. Port Jackson in 1788 The fleet arrived in Port Jackson in New South Wales on 26 January 1788. The original destination had been Botany Bay, but this area was deemed unsuitable for settlement. Within days Bryant and Mary Broad were married, one of five couples to be married by Reverend Richard Johnson in the first marriage ceremony in the new colony. Bryant signed his name on the register; Mary made her mark.Cook 1993,104 Bryant's skills as a fisherman were in demand as the First Fleet had neglected to include enough people with knowledge of farming, fishing or gardening. He was put in charge of fishing and allowed to build a hut for his family in Farm Cove‚Äîa rare privilege for a convict.Cook 1993,108 A year later, when rations were dwindling and the colony was going hungry, Bryant was caught holding back some of his catch for his own use and to swap for vegetables and was sentenced to 100 lashes. He was also evicted from his hut and put to work on the brick-making gang, but the colony soon found they could not do without his fishing skills and he returned to his hut and was put back in charge of fishing.Cook 1993, 123 The following year, 1790, saw the arrival of a son for Bryant and his wife. He was given the name Emmanuel, which was a Bryant family name. It also saw the arrival of the Second Fleet. Bryant's sentence was due to expire in March 1791 and he would have been able to work his passage home to England. His wife, however, had a further two years of her sentence to run; since she would be unable to work her passage home she was in effect facing a lifetime in the colony. And the governor had announced that no convict, even if their sentence had expired, would be allowed to leave the colony if they left behind a wife and children who could not support themselves.Cook 1993, 145‚Äì6 Although supplies brought by the Second Fleet had warded off the threat of starvation for the time being, the long term prospects for the colony still looked bleak, and so the Bryants decided that escape was their only option. Escape In December 1790 the Waaksamheyd, a Dutch ship that had been chartered to bring provisions from Batavia (present day Jakarta), arrived in the colony and was to stay for several weeks while negotiations took place over a further charter.Cook 1993, 144 Bryant and his wife befriended the Dutch captain, Detmer Smith, and acquired from him the things they would need for their escape: a compass, quadrant, chart, rice, salt pork, flour, a barrel for water, two muskets and ammunition. The plan was to steal a boat and head for the Dutch East Indies 3,000 miles away. The Waaksamheyd left Port Jackson on 27 March 1791, having been chartered to return to England. With no ship left in the harbour to give chase and the monsoon season fast approaching, Bryant decided to make his escape the following day when darkness fell. Along with his wife and two children, and seven other convicts (James Martin, James Cox and Samuel Bird from the First Fleet, and William Allen, Nathaniel Lilly, navigator William Morton and Samuel Broom from the Second Fleet),Cook 1993, 147 he boarded the governor's cutter and loaded the provisions and equipment. They made their way past South Point without being spotted by the lookout and into the open sea. It was only in the morning that the escape was discovered. There was a certain amount of sympathy and admiration for the convicts; John Easty, a private in the Marines, wrote: > Today 8 men with 1 woman and 2 Children Convicts toke a kings boat of 6 oars > with a large quantity of provisions... it was Supposed that they intinded > for Bativee but having no vessell in the habour thare was no Pursueing them > so thay got Clear of, but it is a very Desperate attempt to go in an open > Boat for a run of about 16 or 17 hundred leags and pertuclar for a woman and > two Small children... but the thoughts of Liberty from Such a place as this > is Enough to induce any Convicts to try all Skeemes to obtain it as they are > the same as slaves all the time thay are in this country.Quoted in Cook > 1993, 153 Bryant and his crew set out to navigate up the east coast of Australia, passing between the Great Barrier Reef and the mainland, through the Torres Strait and across the Arafura Sea to Timor. They had to make frequent landings to find food and fresh water and caulk the seams of the boat. Sometimes they were watched by Aborigines, at first just curious, but as they went further north, more hostile. The cutter had two sails, and six oars that had to be used when the wind dropped.Cook 1993, 161‚Äì2 Before they reached the more sheltered waters of the Great Barrier Reef the weather deteriorated and they survived two storms, at one time being blown out to sea without sight of land for eight days. Sailing up the Great Barrier Reef they were able to stop on uninhabited islands and replenish their food stocks with fresh turtle and shellfish. After sailing through the Torres Straits into the Gulf of Carpentaria they encountered a hostile reception from natives who on occasion pursued them in canoes. Kupang harbour Finally, 69 days after leaving Port Jackson, having sailed 3,254 miles, they made landfall at Kupang on the island of Timor.Cook 1993, 168 The escaped convicts had prepared a story to explain their arrival at Kupang in a small boat. Bryant took his wife's maiden name, calling himself William Broad, and told the authorities that they were some of the survivors from a shipwreck on the Great Barrier Reef. The Dutch governor Timotheus Wanjon believed their story and provided them with accommodation, food and clothing, with Bryant signing bills that the governor could then send to the British government for reimbursement. The men found work on the quays and the next few months in the healthy climate of Kupang provided them with a respite from their privations.Cook 1993, 170‚Äì1 Recapture and death Bryant died in Batavia On 15 September, however, another four small boats arrived in Kupang, carrying Captain Edward Edwards and the remains of the crew of HMS Pandora, sunk off the Barrier Reef, as well as ten Bounty mutineers whom he had captured and who had survived the wreck. Although accounts differ as to exactly what happened, it was around this time that the authorities became suspicious of Bryant and his party, they were discovered to be escaped convicts and imprisoned.Cook 1993, 177‚Äì8 Even in prison they were not badly treated, the men being allowed out to work two at a time. On 5 October they, all in good health, were handed over to Edwards who had chartered the Rembang to take his crew and the Bounty mutineers on to Batavia, from where he could find passages for them to the Cape of Good Hope. On the Rembang the prisoners were subjected to the harsh conditions that Edwards was notorious for and were put in chains and given only enough food to prevent starvation. The captain of the Rembang had offered to provide a cabin for Mary Bryant and the children but Edwards refused the offer.Cook 1993, 180 When the Rembang arrived in Batavia a month later some of the convicts, including Bryant, were already suffering from fever and were moved ashore to the Dutch East India Company Hospital. Mary Bryant was allowed to accompany her sick son and husband. Bryant's son Emmanuel died in the hospital 1 December 1791. Bryant died in the Dutch East India Company Hospital in Batavia on 22 December 1791, three weeks after the death of his son.Cook 1993, 183; Currey 1963, 31 The widow Bryant and his son were the first of the convicts to die, but they were soon followed by three more. William Morton the navigator and Samuel Bird died of a fever on the passage from Batavia to the Cape of Good Hope. At this time they were still under the control of Captain Edwards and were kept in irons and only allowed on deck for an hour in the evening. James Cox, possibly in a final escape bid, went overboard during this exercise time while the ship was passing through the Straits of Sunda. At the time the shore was only 2 miles away, so it is possible that Cox could have reached it, although it would have been unlikely if he had been in a weakened state and in handcuffs.Cook 1993, 186 At the Cape of Good Hope Bryant's widow and her daughter Charlotte and the remaining four convicts were handed over to Commander John Parker of HMS Gorgon, who was returning from Port Jackson. On this final leg of their journey back to England they received better treatment, with Mary being given a cabin to nurse her ailing daughter. Charlotte died on 6 May 1792 and was buried at sea.Cook 1993, 188 Also on the Gorgon were marines and their wives and children returning from Port Jackson. The marines included Captain Watkin Tench who had known Bryant and his wife since the days when he was in charge of the marines guarding the Dunkirk prison hulk and had sailed with them on the Charlotte to Australia. Captain Tench made the following comment about Bryant's escape: > I confess that I never looked at these people without pity and astonishment. > They had miscarried in a heroic struggle for liberty; after having combated > every hardship and conquered every difficulty.Quoted in Cook 1993, 190 When Bryant's widow and the remaining four convicts finally reached London in July 1792, just over 5 years since the First Fleet had departed for Australia, they could have been expecting to face the gallows. Instead they found they had become something of celebrities; James Boswell took up their cause and they were pardoned. Mary Bryant received her pardon in May 1793 after spending nearly a year in Newgate Prison, where her conditions had been alleviated by money donated by members of the public. After spending the summer in London in lodgings provided by Boswell, she decided to return to her family in Fowey. Boswell gave her a small annuity, which was cancelled by his family after his death in 1795. At that stage Bryant's widow disappears from the records. The other four convicts were released, largely thanks to Boswell's efforts, on 2 November 1793.Cook 1993, 234‚Äì7 Legacy Bryant's voyage from Port Jackson to Timor in a small open boat has been compared to that of William Bligh and the castaways of the Bounty. Bligh had the more experienced crew, including the sailing master of the Bounty; Bryant had the advantage of a route that included more coastal waters. \\"In the last analysis, it is generally conceded that each of the groups performed an amazing feat entitling them to a secure place in the annals of human endeavour\\", concluded C. H. Currey.Currey 1963, 22‚Äì3 Bryant kept a log of the journey from Port Jackson to Kupang, Reminescences on a Voyage from Sydney Cove, N.S.W. to Timor. When he was taken prisoner in Kupang, the journal fell into the hands of the governor, Timotheus Wanjon, who showed it to William Bligh and one of his lieutenants on HMS Providence, George Tobin, when they were in Kupang in October 1792. Bligh, who concluded that Bryant \\"must have been a determined and enterprising man\\", made notes from the journal, and intended to have it copied, but this was only partially done. The original was lost; the Dutch National Archives could find no trace of it in response to a query in 1962 and suggested that it could have been destroyed during the occupation of Timor in 1811‚Äì17 when the British used the Kupang archives to make cartridges.Currey 1963, 53 Bryant's widow Mary also left an account of the escape, dictated to James Boswell the day before she left London for Fowey. \\"I went to her in the forenoon and wrote two sheets of paper of her curious account of the escape from Botany Bay\\", wrote Boswell in his journal. These two sheets of paper have never been found.Pottle 1938, 26 But in the 1930s a previously unknown account of the escape, James Martin's Memorandoms, was found amongst the papers of Jeremy Bentham at University College, London.Blount 1937; Causer 2014 It is believed to have been written when Martin was in Newgate Prison, and is the only extant journal of a First Fleet convict, and the only extant first-hand account of the Bryants' escape.Wantrup, J. 1987 Australian Rare Books 1788-1900. Sydney: Horden House Pty Ltd, 97 The Memorandoms was published, in open-access, by UCL Press in June 2017, reproducing the original manuscripts alongside an introduction and detailed annotation.Causer 2017 The story of William and Mary Bryant's escape has been the subject of books, drama and films. He was portrayed by Leonard Teale in the 1963 Australian Broadcasting Commission serial, The Hungry Ones, and by Alex O'Loughlin in The Incredible Journey of Mary Bryant. O'Loughlin was nominated for the 2006 Logie Award for Most Outstanding Actor. References Bibliography *Blount, C. (ed.) 1937 Memorandoms by James Martin.

In the lead up to these championships, Targett developed a reputation at his club for his intensive strength regime outside the pool. 2012 Olympics Targett was only selected for the 4√ó100-metre freestyle relay alongside countrymen James Magnussen, Eamon Sullivan and James Roberts. As favorites leading up to the London Games, the team was dubbed \\"Weapons of Mass Destruction\\" by the Australian media. The morning team, of which Targett and Sullivan were not part of, qualified fastest for the final. In what has been named by some to be \\"darkest day\\" in swimming in recent memory, the team came only 4th behind France, the US and Russia. After a slow start by Magnussen, Targett as second swimmer held on to gain a position, while Sullivan, who had the fastest split of the team retained third place, however anchor James Roberts was unable to hold off a Russian powerhouse team, and was pipped at the wall and finished in 4th position. In a surprise decision by the Australian coaching staff, Targett was selected to swim the butterfly leg of the 4√ó100-metre medley relay in the heats. Targett swam a 51.30 and as a result was placed into the team for the final along with Hayden Stoeckel, Christian Sprenger and James Magnussen. Australia cinched bronze in the final, behind the US who claimed gold and only 0.32 of a second behind Japan. Modeling career In 2012 Targett launched his career as a male model, signing with Melbourne editorial agency Chadwick Models.

It was a revival of Guts, and debuted on September 15, 2008. The show was taped in Sound Stages 23 and 24 at Universal Studios Florida, housing the Extreme Arena and the Aggro Crag, respectively.Handiboe, John - Central Florida News 13 Article \\"Got Guts?\\" Stage 21, where the original Guts program taped, was most recently occupied by production of Impact Wrestling. This version is hosted by Ben Lyons and officiated by Australian celebrity Asha Kuerten. It was the first (and only) Nickelodeon production to be produced at Universal Studios Florida since the closing of Nickelodeon Studios in 2005. For unknown reasons, Season Two was never aired in North America. Gameplay The show is unlike the original Guts as it follows a tournament-style structure of twelve teams being narrowed down to six during six preliminary episodes, and then three in three semifinal episodes, with the final teams competing in an hour-long \\"Aggro Bowl\\". The preliminaries consist of two events and then the Aggro Crag. Points also do not determine the winner. Each point a team is ahead of the other is worth a tenth-second head start (10 Points equal 1 second, maximum: 7 in the preliminaries, and 10 in the semi-finals and the Aggro Bowl for Season 1) in the Aggro Crag. In the semi finals, there are three events before the Aggro Crag that are more difficult than the previous round. The Aggro Crag is also more elaborate and challenging and the maximum head start is 10 seconds. Events Preliminary events *Free Run City - Teammates must have a relay and get through many obstacles to get to the finish, beating the other team. This is a two-minute timed event. Each second a team has left under two minutes is worth a point. *Sky Slam - Two teammates from two different teams compete in a basketball challenge where they are connected to elastic wires, in order to slam dunk baskets. a teammate is able to call a defense from their team to help block the opponent for a slam dunk. Each dunk is worth 10 points, whoever has the most at the end of 90 seconds wins. *Flying Football - This challenge is related to the Sky Slam event, but this is where the competitors must play in football style. Each catch is worth 10 points, whoever has the most at the end of 90 seconds wins. *Supertoe PK - The competitors must kick soccer balls into making the most points, whoever has the most at the end, wins that challenge. Each goal is worth ten points. This is a 90-second timed event. *Vert Ball - In a related vein of dodgeball, the teams must get the opposite team's members out. In order to win the event, they must avoid the other teams's offense hurling for 90 seconds. Each hit is worth 10 points. Semifinal events *Air Slalom - One player from each team is strapped onto a snowboard, one standing on the \\"launchpad\\", and the two remaining players are attached to ropes that connect to the snowboard and help steer. The team must steer the person on the snowboard around as many flags as possible. Each gate cleared is worth 10 points. *Formula Guts - A two-person relay around the track in a \\"pod-bike\\". Each driver runs one lap, and must switch over during a pit-stop halfway during the race. The winning team receives 100 points, while the losing team receives 75 points. *Volley Brawl - Two volleyball courts are set up with two players on each of the four sides. One stands on the floor and serves a volleyball, while the other jumps off the Aerial Bridge and attempts to hit it over the net. This is a 90-second timed event. Aggro Bowl events *Guts Grand Prix - A two-player race in which one player rides a \\"High-Stepper\\" (a bike with no seat) and the other rides a \\"Low Rider\\" (a vehicle similar to the one used in Wild Wheels of the original Guts). The first teammate must cross their finish line before the second may begin; first place is worth 100 points, second place is worth 75 points, third place is worth 50 points. This event took place outdoors, at Universal Studios Florida's New York Street area. *Mile High Triple Jump - Only one contestant participates for each team. He or she must clear a high jump bar and two \\"hurdles\\" by jumping off the ground with help of elastic cord. Finally, he or she must then take a sticky marker, jump off a platform, and attempt to paste it on a vertical wall. Each bar, hurdle, and vertical foot on the leap cleared is worth 10 points. *Free Run City: Wild Side - A re-designed Free Run City from the preliminary episodes with some modifications including pipes, poles, and ladders added to the Water Tower, missing cat-swings from the SkyBridge, and an all-new obstacle \\"Drop Zone\\", in which players must slide down a zipline in a harness and try to drop down onto a giant manhole. *Alley Hoop - This is a 90-second timed event. One player needs to toss basketballs from the ground up to their partners jumping off platforms, who must catch them and throw them into a central hoop. Each basket is worth 10 points. The Aggro Crag This takes place when the families must climb a mountain to taste \\"My Family's Got Guts\\" victory and win the competition. Preliminary episodes require two players to climb the Crag - one climbing up their respective side of the mountain through the \\"Ice-Surfin' Switchbacks\\", a set of wobbly wedges that players needed to maneuver around, climb over the \\"Skeleton Stalagmites\\", and activate three actuators including one at the end of this first leg, \\"Avalanche Peak\\" with a \\"frozen lava storm\\" raining down on contestants. This in turns opens the Ice Portal at the base of the Crag, where the second player awaits. They must then cross some stepping stones across \\"The Glacial Gorge\\" and climb two vertical rock climbing walls dubbed \\"The Vertical Freeze\\", to reach the Crystal Peak and hit their final actuator to finalize the results. Semifinal episodes now required all four players to climb the Crag. A new section was added, \\"The Mad Mesas\\", which was a path of boulders that the contestant needed to run over to reach the second player at the base of the Switchbacks. Their final actuator would open up a trapdoor in Avalanche Peak that lead them to a spiraling \\"Swirling Vortex\\" slide that lead them behind the main facade of the Crag and to the third player, who had to navigate the \\"Crag Caverns\\". Once they had maneuvered this maze, they needed to traverse the entire Glacial Gorge around the entire mountain and reach the base of the mountain, which would finally open the Ice Portal and allow the fourth player to climb the Vertical Freeze to victory. In Aggro Bowls, a control panel was now placed at the start of the Crag Caverns where the third player from each team could control additional snow and hail that could challenge their respective opponents climbing the Mesas and Switchbacks. Once the second player made the exchange with the third, he or she could take over control and release \\"Arctic Steam\\" in the Crag Caverns and drop an avalanche on the fourth players climbing the Vertical Freeze. For each victory, teams receive a white \\"piece of the Aggro Crag\\". The champion of the tournament receives all three including a considerably larger third piece, which can be put together to form a miniature Aggro Crag as a trophy along with the grand prize of a trip on the Nickelodeon Family Cruise.

Meaning that if you are close enough to get a harmful dose of radiation from a 1 megaton weapons, you are going to die from blast effects alone. *Initial stage‚Äîthe first 1‚Äì9 weeks, in which are the greatest number of deaths, with 90% due to thermal injury and/or blast effects and 10% due to super-lethal radiation exposure. *Intermediate stage‚Äîfrom 10‚Äì12 weeks. The deaths in this period are from ionizing radiation in the median lethal range - LD50 *Late period‚Äîlasting from 13‚Äì20 weeks. This period has some improvement in survivors' condition. *Delayed period‚Äîfrom 20+ weeks. Characterized by numerous complications, mostly related to healing of thermal and mechanical injuries, and if the individual was exposed to a few hundred to a thousand millisieverts of radiation, it is coupled with infertility, sub-fertility and blood disorders. Furthermore, ionizing radiation above a dose of around 50-100 millisievert exposure has been shown to statistically begin increasing a person's chance of dying of cancer sometime in their lifetime over the normal unexposed rate of c. 25%, in the long term, a heightened rate of cancer, proportional to the dose received, would begin to be observed after c. 5+ years, with lesser problems, such as eye cataracts, and other more minor effects in other organs and tissue also being observed over the long term. Depending on whether individuals further afield shelter in place or evacuate perpendicular to the direction of the wind, and therefore avoid contact with the fallout plume, and stay there for the days and weeks after the nuclear explosion, their exposure to fallout, and therefore their total dose, will vary. With those who do shelter in place, and or evacuate, experiencing a total dose that would be negligible in comparison to someone who just went about their life as normal.7 hour rule: At 7 hours after detonation the fission product activity will have decreased to about 1/10 (10%) of its amount at 1 hour. At about 2 days (49 hours-7X7) the activity will have decreased to 1% of the 1-hour value! http://www.falloutradiation.com/johnwayne7Nuclear Warfare chapter 9 see page 22 Staying indoors until after the most hazardous fallout isotope, I-131 decays away to 0.1% of its initial quantity after ten half-lives ‚Äì which is represented by 80 days in the care of I-131 cases, would make the difference between likely contracting thyroid cancer or escaping completely from this substance depending on the actions of the individual. Some scientists estimate that if there were a nuclear war resulting in 100 Hiroshima-size nuclear explosions on cities, it could cause significant loss of life in the tens of millions from long term climatic effects alone. The climatology hypothesis is that if each city firestorms, a great deal of soot could be thrown up into the atmosphere which could blanket the earth, cutting out sunlight for years on end, causing the disruption of food chains, in what is termed a nuclear winter scenario.Philip Yam. Nuclear Exchange, Scientific American, June 2010, p. 24.Alan Robock and Owen Brian Toon. Local Nuclear War, Global Suffering, Scientific American, January 2010, p. 74-81. Blast effects ‚Äî the initial stage  Immediate post-attack period Melted and fused pieces of metal (including coins that were in people's pockets) from the Atomic bombings of Japan. The melting of metal like this occurred during the ensuing fires and firestorms, long after the bombs had exploded. The main causes of death and disablement in this state are thermal burns and the failure of structures resulting from the blast effect. Injury from the pressure wave is minimal in contrast because the human body can survive up to 2 bar (30 psi) while most buildings can withstand only a 0.8 bar (12 psi) blast. Therefore, the fate of humans is closely related to the survival of the buildings around them.Middleton, Hugh. \\"Medical Consequences of Radiation Following a Global Nuclear War.\\" The Aftermath (1983): 50-56. Fate within certain peak overpressure * over 0.8 bar (12 psi) - 98% dead, 2% injured * 0.3 - 0.8 bar (5-12 psi) - 50% dead, 40% injured, 10% safe * 0.14 - 0.3 bar (2-5 psi) - 5% dead, 45% injured, 50% safe Types of radioactive exposure after a nuclear attack Japanese woman (one of the Hiroshima Maidens) suffering burns from thermal radiation after the United States dropped nuclear bombs on Japan. In a nuclear explosion, the human body can be irradiated by at least three processes. The first, and most significant, cause of burns is thermal radiation and not caused by ionizing radiation. * Thermal burns from infrared heat radiation, these would be the most common burn type experienced by personnel. * If people come in direct contact with fallout, beta burns from shallow ionizing beta radiation will be experienced, the largest particles (visible to the naked eye) in local fallout would be likely to have very high radioactivity because they would be deposited so soon after detonation; this fraction of the total fallout is called the prompt or local fallout fraction. It is likely that one such particle upon the skin would be able to cause a localized beta burn. This local fallout, termed Bikini snow after the Pacific island weapon tests, was experienced by the crew on the deck of the Lucky Dragon fishing ship following the explosion of the 15 megaton Shrimp device in the Castle Bravo event. However, these particular decay particles (beta particles) are very weakly penetrating and have a short range, requiring almost direct contact between fallout and personnel to be harmful. * Rarer still would be personnel who experience radiation burns from highly penetrating gamma radiation. This would likely cause deep gamma penetration within the body, which would result in uniform whole body irradiation rather than only a surface burn. In cases of whole body gamma irradiation (c. 10 Gy) due to accidents involving medical product irradiators, some of the human subjects have developed injuries to their skin between the time of irradiation and death. In the picture above, the normal clothing (a kimono) that the woman was wearing attenuated the far reaching thermal radiation; the kimono, however, would naturally have been unable to attenuate any gamma radiation, if she were close enough to the weapon to have experienced any, and it would be likely that any such penetrating radiation effect would be evenly applied to her entire body. Beta burns would likely be all over the body if there was contact with fallout after the explosion, unlike thermal burns, which are only ever on one side of the body, as heat radiation infrared naturally does not penetrate the human body. In addition, the pattern on her clothing has been burnt into the skin by the thermal radiation. This is because white fabric reflects more visible and infrared light than dark fabric. As a result, the skin underneath dark fabric is burned more than the skin covered by white clothing. There is also the risk of internal radiation poisoning by ingestion of fallout particles, if one is in a fallout zone. Radiation poisoning Radiation poisoning, also called \\"radiation sickness\\" or a \\"creeping dose\\", is a form of damage to organ tissue due to excessive exposure to ionizing radiation. The term is generally used to refer to acute problems caused by a large dosage of radiation in a short period, though this also has occurred with long-term exposure to low-level radiation. Many of the symptoms of radiation poisoning occur as ionizing radiation interferes with cell division. There are numerous lethal radiation syndromes, including prodromal syndrome, bone marrow death, central nervous system death and gastrointestinal death.Coggle, J.E., Lindop, Patricia J. \\"Medical Consequences of Radiation Following a Global Nuclear War.\\" The Aftermath (1983): 60-71.  Prodromal syndrome  The ‚Äúprodromal syndrome‚Äù is not a diagnosis, but the technical term used by health professionals to describe a specific group of symptoms that may precede the onset of an illness. For example, a fever is ‚Äúprodromal‚Äù to measles, which means that a fever may be a risk factor for developing this illness.  Bone marrow death  Bone marrow death is caused by a dose of radiation between 2 and 10 Gray and is characterized by the part of the bone marrow that makes the blood being broken down. Therefore, production of red and white blood cells and platelets is stopped due to loss of the blood-making stem cells (4.5 Gray kills 95% of stem cells). The loss of platelets greatly increases the chance of fatal hemorrhage, while the lack of white blood cells causes infections; the fall in red blood cells is minimal, and only causes mild anemia. The exposure to 4.5 Gray of penetrating gamma rays has many effects that occur at different times: In 24 hours: *vomiting *diarrhea These will usually abate after 6‚Äì7 days. Within 3‚Äì4 weeks there is a period of extreme illness. *severe bloody diarrhea, indicating intestinal disorders causing fluid imbalance *extensive internal bleeding *sepsis infections The peak incidence of acute BM death corresponds to the 30-day nadir in blood cell numbers. The number of deaths then falls progressively until it reaches 0 at 60 days after irradiation. The amount of radiation greatly affects the probability of death. For example, over the range of 2 to 6 Gray the probability of death in untreated adults goes from about 1% to 99%, but these figures are for healthy adults. Therefore, results may differ, because of the thermal and mechanical injuries and infectious conditions.  Gastrointestinal death  Gastrointestinal death is caused by a dose of radiation between 10 and 50 Gray. Whole body doses cause damage to epithelial cells lining the gastrointestinal tract and this combined with the bone marrow damage is fatal. All symptoms become increasingly severe, causing exhaustion and emaciation in a few days and death within 7‚Äì14 days from loss of water and electrolytes. The symptoms of gastrointestinal death are: *gastrointestinal pain *anorexia *nausea *vomiting *diarrhea  Central nervous system death  Central nervous system death is the main cause of death in 24‚Äì48 hours among those exposed to 50 Gray. The symptoms are: *vomiting *nausea *diarrhea *drowsiness *lethargy *tremors *delirium *frequent seizures *convulsions *heat prostration *coma *respiratory failure *death  Short-term effects (6‚Äì8 weeks)   Skin  The skin is susceptible to beta-emitting radioactive fallout. The principal site of damage is the germinal layer, and often the initial response is erythema (reddening) due to blood vessels congestion and edema. Erythema lasting more than 10 days occurs in 50% of people exposed to 5-6 Gray. Other effects with exposure include: *2‚Äì3 Gray‚Äîtemporary hair loss *7 Gray‚Äîpermanent epilation occurs *10 Gray‚Äîitching and flaking occurs *10‚Äì20 Gray‚Äîweeping blistering and ulceration will occur  Lungs  The lungs are the most radiosensitive organ, and radiation pneumonitis can occur leading to pulmonary insufficiency and death (100% after exposure to 50 Gray of radiation), in a few months. Radiation pneumonitis is characterized by: *Loss of epithelial cells *Edema *Inflammation *Occlusions of airways, air sacs and blood vessels *Fibrosis  Ovaries  A single dose of 1‚Äì2 Gray will cause temporary damage and suppress menstruation for periods up to 3 years; a dose of 4 Gray will cause permanent sterility.  Testicles A dose of 0.1 Gray will cause low sperm counts for up to a year; 2.5 Gray will cause sterility for 2 to 3 years or more. 4 Gray will cause permanent sterility. Long-term effects Cataract induction The timespan for developing this symptom ranges from 6 months to 30 years to develop but the median time for developing them is 2‚Äì3 years. *2 Gray of gamma rays cause opacities in a few percent *6-7 Gray can seriously impair vision and cause cataracts Cancer induction Cancer induction is the most significant long-term risk of exposure to a nuclear bomb. Approximately 1 out of every 80 people exposed to 1 Gray will die from cancer, in addition to the normal rate of 20 out of 80. About 1 in 40 people will get cancer, in addition to the typical rates of 16-20 out of 40. Different types of cancer take different times for them to appear: *2 years for leukemia to appear *20 or more years for skin cancer or lung cancer In utero effects on human development A 1 Gy dose of radiation will cause between 0 and 20 extra cases of perinatal mortality, per 1,000 births and 0-20 cases per 1000 births of severe mental sub-normality. A 0.05 Gy dose will increase death due to cancer 10 fold, from the normal 0.5 per 1000 birth rate to a rate of 5 per 1,000. An antenatal dose of 1 Gy in the first trimester causes the lifetime risk of fatal cancer sometime in the child's life to increase from c. 25% in non-exposed humans to 100% in the first trimester after exposure. Transgenerational genetic damage Exposure to even relatively low doses of radiation generates genetic damage in the progeny of irradiated rodents. This damage can accumulate over several generations. No statistically demonstrable increase of congenital malformations was found among the later conceived children born to survivors of the Nuclear weapons at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.Teratology in the Twentieth Century Plus Ten The surviving women of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, that could conceive, who were exposed to substantial amounts of radiation, went on and had children with no higher incidence of abnormalities than the Japanese average. Infectious diseases resulting from nuclear attack It was assumed in the 1983 book Medical Consequences of Radiation Following a Global Nuclear War that, although not caused by radiation, one of the long-term effects of a nuclear war would be a massive increase in infectious diseases caused by fecal matter contaminated water from untreated sewage, crowded living conditions, poor standard of living, and lack of vaccines in the aftermath of a nuclear war, with the following list of diseases being cited: *Dysentery *Typhoid *Infectious hepatitis *Salmonellosis *Cholera *Meningococcal meningitis *Tuberculosis *Diphtheria *Whooping cough *Polio *Pneumonia However although what the authors describe are conditions already prevalent in many of the world's city slums, it is inconceivable why people would try to remain living in crowded conditions by reverting to slum lifestyles, during or after a nuclear war. As many cities would already be destroyed, with urban life, slum or otherwise, this would serve no benefit to inhabitants. There would be billions of disease carrying vectors, in the form of city residents, lying deceased in cities caused by the direct nuclear weapons effects alone, with the surviving few billion people spread out in rural communities living agrarian lifestyles, with the survivors therefore posing a way of living far less prone to creating the crowded slum living conditions required for infectious diseases to spread. Moreover, as reported in a paper published in the journal Public Health Reports, it is also one of a number of prevalent myths that infectious diseases always occur after a disaster in cities.http://www.publichealthreports.org/issueopen.cfm?articleID=2091 See also * Blast shelter * Fallout shelter * Textbook of Military Medicine  Notes  Nuclear weapons Radiobiology Radiation health effects ","title":"Effects of nuclear explosions on human health"},{"id":"18806742","text":"Sir John Bennet (1553 - 15 February 1627) was a judge and politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1597 and 1621. His career ended in controversy after he was found guilty of extorting bribes and excessive fees. Education Bennet was the second son of Richard Bennet of Clapcot, Berkshire (now in Oxfordshire) and his wife, Elizabeth Tesdale, the daughter of Thomas Tesdale of Stanford Dingley and Abingdon. She was the half-sister of Thomas Tesdale, the founder of Pembroke College, Oxford. History of Parliament Online - Bennet, John He was probably educated at John Roysse's Free School in Abingdon (now Abingdon School). of which his family were benefactors. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford in 1573. He was awarded BA on 11 June 1577 and was promoted to MA on 15 June 1580. 'Alumni Oxonienses, 1500-1714: Bennell-Bloye', Alumni Oxonienses 1500-1714: Abannan-Kyte (1891), pp. 106-141. Date accessed: 9 February 2012 In 1583 he was incorporated at Cambridge and awarded MA there. He returned to Oxford and was elected a proctor in 1585. He was awarded his BCL and DCL by special dispensation on 6 July 1589. In the following year was admitted as an advocate in the Court of Arches. Career Bennet began his career as vicar-general and chancellor in the Diocese of York, probably through the influence of John Piers, the Archbishop of York, who had been the Dean of Christ Church. He was joint commissary of the exchequer court. In 1591 he was appointed to the prebend of Langtoft. In 1594 he was appointed J.P. for the East Riding of Yorkshire. He advanced his career in other areas, serving as a legal adviser to a commission negotiating with Scotland about the security of the border, and in 1599 was appointed to the Council of the North. In 1597, Bennet was elected Member of Parliament for Ripon. He was elected MP for York in 1601. He was knighted at Whitehall on 23 July 1603. In 1603 or 1604 he became judge of the Prerogative Court of Canterbury, retaining his positions in York as commissary until 1609 and chancellor until 1624. He was elected MP for Ripon again in 1604. During his time in Parliament, he defended the ecclesiastical courts but was unsuccessful in preventing a bill prohibiting married men residing with their families in the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge Universities. He was a member of the High Court of Delegates, hearing appeals from ecclesiastical and admiralty courts, and the Court of High Commission. In 1608 he was appointed Master in Chancery in Ordinary and in 1611 was appointed to the council of Queen Anne, wife of James I. He was growing in wealth and status and is reported to have offered ¬£30,000 to become Lord Chancellor, without success. Bennet, who was interested in the affairs of Oxford University, was asked by Sir Thomas Bodley to act as fund-raiser for the Bodleian Library, a task he carried out efficiently. Bennet was one of the first governors of Pembroke College, Oxford. He was elected MP for Oxford University in 1614 and 1621. However, he was accused by Richard Kilvert in Parliament of extracting bribes and excessive fees in his judicial work. The issue was debated in his absence, Bennet pleading ill- health, and it was decided that he should be expelled from the House of Commons and the case referred to the House of Lords. He was placed under house arrest. When he appeared before the House of Lords, he said that he could account for all but ¬£4,000 of the money that had passed through his hands. He was bailed in the sum of ¬£20,000 and ordered to pay to Oxford University ¬£1,000 that he still had as executor of Thomas Bodley's estate: he only paid ¬£550. When the case was eventually tried, Bennet's counsel put up a weak defence. Bennet was fined ¬£20,000, but punishments of imprisonment and disqualification from office were later lifted. It was said that his profiteering from his post overshadowed that of Francis Bacon: \\"Sir John Bennet hath made my Lord Chancellor an honest man\\". Personal life Bennet married firstly Alice Weekes daughter of Christopher Weekes of Salisbury and had four sons and two daughters. She died in 1601 and he married secondly Elizabeth Lowe, daughter of Sir Thomas Lowe, alderman of London. She died in 1614 and he married thirdly Leonora daughter of Adrian Vierandeels of Antwerp, a widow. Bennet died on 15 February 1627 and was buried at Christ Church, London.

His name is written in Meroitic, while his throne name is written in classical Egyptian hieroglyphs. He is thus far only known from his pyramid in Meroe (Beg. N17). The pyramid occupies an area of 8.6 X 8.6 m and is, therefore, one of the smaller royal pyramids at Meroe. In front of the pyramid there was a decorated chapel. The decoration was copied by the Lepsius expedition. One wall was brought to Berlin, where it is displayed in the Neues Museum. Another, now only preserved in six blocks, is in the British Museum in London.Pharaons noirs, sur la Piste des Quarante Jours, Mariemont 2007, p. 164-65 (Nr. 81) Three skeletons were found in the burial chamber of the pyramid - two of them belonging to women, the third to a man of about 30 years, which are, perhaps, the remains of the king himself. There is little evidence for dating the king. The small size of the pyramid indicates a date after Natakamani, under whom the pyramids in general became smaller.

The version seen on the right was engraved by Samuel Phillips in 1798, under commission from John Boydell for a posthumous edition of Hogarth's works, but Phillips's final, third state was not published until 1808.Baumgarten, p.238  Analysis  Charles Colyear, 2nd Earl of Portmore (1700‚Äì1785). (Joshua Reynolds) The work, a forerunner of Marriage √†-la-mode, was intended to satirise and poke fun at the types of dress and garbs that were in fashion at the time, and the superficiality of the tastes and nature of the aristocracy in general. Several figures are seen in the painting, all of whom are dressed in heavily caricatured renditions of the fashion that reigned in the 1740s. Most prominently exhibited is an elderly woman wearing a sacque covered with satirically overblown roses expanded by a large hoop. Standing near her is an opulently dressed man, thought to be \\"Beau\\" Colyear, 2nd Earl of Portmore (the dress he wears is said to be the very same he wore to his birthday in the year of the painting's creation)Sala, p.273 The two huddle together in admiration over the minute porcelain cup held by the lady and saucer held by the lord.Porter, p.189 Also part of the company is another woman clutching the chin of a black page boy wearing a turban - thought to be designed after Ignatius Sancho, an actor and writer, in his youthNichols and Steevens, Hogarth's Works, ii, 158, iii.333, noted in DNB, s.v. \\"Ignatius Sancho\\". - both of whom are also dressed as exquisitely as the first two. The black page, holding a type of Chinese porcelain figure, is a servant, and was painted in as an element of irony in the work; as a slave, he mocks his masters, who themselves bowed before fashions and the latest frivolities of upper-class life. Even the monkey standing in the centre foreground wears a flowing, cuffed robe as he examines the list of purchases made by one of the four - it is not known whom - at a recent auction.Dobson, p. 82 In the painting on the wall, the transitory nature of fashion is represented by the cupids at left, who use a bellows to blow up a fire of discarded petticoats and wigs; at right, the classical form of the female sculptureHer pose is that of the Venus de' Medici seen from the back, but she wears high-heeled shoes. is contrasted with the cutaway rear view of her enormous hoop underskirt stiffened with whalebone, \\"the mode 1742\\" as the painting's legend has it.

On this occasion she engaged the services of Hogarth with the specific intent of commissioning a painting that would humorously mock what she considered to be the ridiculous fashions and indulgences of the upper class of the time, and \\"female adornment\\".Goodman, p.97 It is reported that she did this as an act of vengeance, as she had been ridiculed by the type of people scoffed at in the painting.Hogarth, p.37 For a price of sixty guineas, Hogarth agreed to fulfil her request, but it is known that he was not particularly fond of his work; Hogarth often felt less enthusiastic about productions for which a specific commission was made, that were executed to order.

Life The son of William Piers or Pierse, was born at South Hinksey Oxford, and baptised in the parish church of All Saints 3 September 1580; his father was John Piers, Archbishop of York. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford 17 August 1599, and became student the same year. He graduated B.A. in 1600, M.A. in 1603, B.D. 1610, D.D. 1614. He became chaplain to John King, and in 1609 he was presented by James I to the rectory of Grafton Regis, Northamptonshire, which he resigned in 1611 on his collation by Bishop King as Archdeacon of Northolt, which he held till 1632. He was heavily influenced by John King, a bishop of London, who himself had been the chaplain to Archbishop Piers, when appointed as chaplain in 1612. At Oxford he followed Arminianism and high church doctrine in William Laud's circle. He was licensed to preach, became a prebendary of St Paul's, and a reader in Divinity. In 1615 he added to his other preferments the rectory of St. Christopher-le-Stocks in the city of London, which he held till 1620. In January 1616 he was presented to the fifth stall as a Canon of Christ Church Cathedral, which he exchanged for the eighth stall 16 December 1618, holding it in commendam till 1632. In 1618 he received from his patron, Bishop King, the prebendal stall of Wildland in St. Paul's Cathedral, holding with it the office of divinity reader. As canon of Christ Church he resided chiefly at Oxford, and, though not the head of a house, served the office of vice-chancellor in 1621-4. As vice-chancellor he used his authority to oppose the Calvinist party in the university, and he secured a D.D. degree for the royalist Robert Sibthorpe. He encouraged the Doctrine of Grace, which rejected predestination and moved towards a more universal truth and divine forgiveness. However, in his early career he still held onto Calvinism. It was the last of these Calvinist political Bishops John Williams of Lincoln, a former Lord Keeper, who appointed Piers to the deanery of Peterborough 9 June 1622. He was elevated in 1630 to the bishopric of Peterborough, being consecrated on 24 October. He obtained letters of dispensation to hold the rectory of Northolt and the canonry of Christ Church together with his bishopric in commendam; Northolt he soon resigned, taking the chapter living of Caistor, 27 February 1632. In October 1632 he was translated from Peterborough to Bath and Wells, with William Laud's backing. He enforced the orthodox ceremonies, and in 1633 issued orders for the positioning and railing of the communion table, being obeyed in 140 churches of the diocese, but resisted by the majority. The churchwardens of Beckington refused to carry out the change, and were excommunicated for their contumacy. Backed up by leading puritan laity in the clothier districts, they appealed to the court of arches, but in vain. A petition sent by parishioners to Laud was disregarded. The churchwarden then appealed to the king, but could get no answer. They were then imprisoned in the county gaol, where they remained for a year, being released in 1637 only on condition of submission and public acknowledgement of their offence. Later Laud, when in the Tower of London in 1642, accepted the whole responsibility. Piers also offended strict Sunday Sabbatarians; the judges of assize had forbidden unlawful Sunday meetings, and ordered that the prohibition should be read by the ministers in the parish church. These orders were reissued in 1632 by Justice Richardson, which Piers opposed the following year using the only available precedent St Gregory's Case. Laud, finding this interference with episcopal jurisdiction, wrote to Piers to obtain the opinion of some of the clergy of his diocese as to how the wakes were conducted. However, by 1636, only 140 of 469 in the Canterbury Province had complied with the ruling. In Somerset Fry and Wheeler, churchwardens refused to move and rail the altar. Laud excommunicated them, which deepened resentment against Arminianism. Piers's reply to Laud upheld the old custom of wakes and church ales or parish ales, basing the outcry against them on Sabbatarianism. He collected seventy-two signatures from clerics who supported wakes and church recreation. Opponents were accused of forming illegal puritan conventicles and alehouses. He proceeded to enforce the reading of the Declaration or Book of Sports in church, visiting the clergy who refused with censure and suspension, but earning widespread antipathy in many parishes of his see. Evidence however shows Piers also hunted recusants. Many lived in Somerset, but few were prosecuted.Walter Raleigh, \\"Works\\", 5.319 Piers also followed Laud's reforms of Wadham College, Oxford, founded by a Somerset squire, in his efforts of 1633 and 1637. Piers was a dedicated bishop, keeping meticulous accounts. He sued the previous bishop Walter Curll for allowing Wells Cathedral to fall into disrepair; although John Cosin called Piers to account for his time at Peterborough. Piers was an equally determined enemy to the 'lectureships'. Secularizing preachers gave a ministry for free; but they lacked uniformity. Piers further ordered that catechising should take the place of lectures, and according to William Prynne, he boasted that, 'thank God, he had not one lecture left in his diocese'. Piers argued that Feast Days, much to puritan anger, were good for the people to enjoy at Thanksgiving and Christmas. According to Raleigh a new type of precisian puritan objected feasts on the Sabbath. Historian Jonathan Barry has demonstrated that ritualism in Somerset linked some clergy and women in outdoor ceremonies to alleged witchcraft; ministers of ejected livings dabbling with Shamanism. The Personal Rule's policies made Piers very unpopular. Ship Money in 1635 collected inland became bitterly resented in puritan villages of North Somerset. In 1636 he decided to appoint his son William Piers as Rector of Buckland St Mary. An argument ensued with puritan noble Sir Francis Popham who owned the advowson, and did not want a high church cleric in his parish. On Laud's fall a petition was presented to the House of Commons against Piers. Within a few days of the committal of Laud to the Tower on 18 December 1640. Piers, together with Bishop Matthew Wren, was impeached before the House of Lords, and bound to appear at the bar on 30 December.\\"Works,\\" 3.243 The 'Articles of Association, 8' (printed in 1642), in fifteen heads, closed with a denunciation of Piers. A committee was appointed to investigate the charges; its scope was widened to embrace the clergy generally. Piers was one of the twelve bishops who signed the protest against the legality of parliamentary proceedings in their enforced absence, for which they were accused of high treason and committed to the Tower in December 1641. At the beginning of their imprisonment he preached to his brother prelates two sermons on 2 Cor. xii. 8-9, which were later published. Having been liberated on bail by the Lords, he and the other were again imprisoned by the Commons. During the period to 1660 he was deprived of his status, but recovered his liberty, and lived on an estate of his own in the parish of Cuddesdon in Oxfordshire, where he married a second time. In 1660 he was restored to his bishopric. At the end of his life he left Wells and lived mainly at Walthamstow in Essex. Here he died in April 1670, in his ninetieth year, and was buried in the parish church. He left two sons by his first wife: William, , later appointed by his father to be Archdeacon of Bath, and John, a lay prebendary of Wells, who inherited the family estate at Cuddesdon.

History A Gino's East deep-dish pizza The original Gino's East was opened in 1966 by two taxi drivers, Sam Levine and Fred Bartoli, and a friend, George Loverde. The deep dish pizza is cooked with the cheese on the bottom, then the toppings and then the sauce. The original location of the restaurant was at 160 East Superior Street, just east of Michigan Avenue, in the Streeterville district of Chicago. Expansion The company subsequently opened other locations in the Chicago Metropolitan Area, including Naperville, Rolling Meadows, Lake Zurich, Deerfield, Oak Lawn, and Highland, Indiana. The Oak Lawn location closed in 2008. The Naperville location closed in late 2010 and the Deerfield location closed in 2012. There was one Gino's East location that operated in Manhattan Beach, California but closed in 1991. Additionally, Gino's East operates a mail-order business, where patrons can order frozen pizzas and have them shipped overnight. The company opened its first restaurant located outside the Chicago area in Granger, Indiana, but closed it in 2012. The restaurant eventually moved from its Superior Street location into another space at 633 North Wells Street (in the former Chicago location of Planet Hollywood). The tradition of writing on the walls, however, remains the same in the new location. The original location on Superior Street reopened in 2007. In 2014, the River North location moved just south of 633 N. Wells to 500 N. LaSalle Street, a building previously occupied by nightclub Lasalle Power Co. In 2014 the company announced expansion into Texas (ATX Brands acquired franchising rights to operate the chain outside the State of Illinois), with the first location outside of Chicago to be located in The Woodlands with a November 2014 opening, followed by a January 2015 opening in Willowbrook, Houston. A San Antonio location opened sometime within the first quarter of 2015 along with an Arlington, TX location. A Downtown Austin location opened in late June 2015. The locations in Texas (Houston, San Antonio, DFW Metroplex) are former Bikinis Sports Bar and Grill locations which were company-owned by ATX Brands. 2015 5 Rabbit beer batch purchase In 2015, 5 Rabbit Brewery announced that it would cease doing business with Donald Trump because of his statements about Mexican immigrants. The brewery had brewed a batch of beer especially for a bar in Trump Tower Chicago, ceased shipping the beer to the bar, and stated that the beer would be renamed to 'Chinga Tu Pelo' (Fuck Your Hair), in an apparent reference to Trump's hair. A few days after that, Gino's East purchased that batch of beer from the brewery.

FairlyLife is Hooksoft's seventh title, along with other games such as _Summer and HoneyComing. The game is described by the development team as . The gameplay in FairlyLife follows a plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the five female main characters. The title and logo of FairlyLife is reminiscent of Hooksoft's fourth title Like Life, and both games feature moe anthropomorphism. A manga adaptation illustrated by Kurumi Morisaki was serialized in Kadokawa Shoten's manga magazine Comp Ace between September 26 and November 26, 2008. Gameplay FairlyLife's gameplay requires little interaction from the player as most of the duration of the game is spent simply reading the text that appears on the screen which represents either dialogue between the various characters or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. Every so often, the player will come to a point where he or she is given the chance to choose from multiple options. The time between these points is variable and can occur anywhere from a minute to much longer. Gameplay pauses at these points and depending on which choice the player makes, the plot will progress in a specific direction. There are five main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. To view all five plot lines, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and make different decisions to progress the plot in an alternate direction. One of the goals of the gameplay is for the player to enable the viewing of hentai scenes depicting the protagonist, Akinori Takaoka, and one of the five heroines having sexual intercourse. Development FairlyLife is Hooksoft's seventh title. The game was directed by Mujin Kawanami, and produced by Akira Asami. The general manager was Kei, and the event planner was Uto Yakamoto.

The suburb is sparsely populated with the only significant population centre being the historic pastoral property of Tahlee, from which the suburb takes its name. The remainder of the suburb is primarily undeveloped bushland. History Earliest inhabitants The earliest inhabitants of this area were the Worimi people tribe. Tahlee comes from the local Aboriginal word, Tarlee, meaning \\"sheltered from the wind and above water\\". Early relationships between the original inhabitants and white settlers were relatively harmonious. In fact, the Australian Agricultural Company (AA Co) would not have succeeded without their help. Tahlee's history since the AA Co's first settlers arrived in 1826 has been inextricably linked to the property of Tahlee, which is located at the southeastern corner of the suburb, adjacent to Port Stephens. The Australian Agricultural Company The Australian Agricultural Company was founded in 1824, through an Act of the British Parliament, with the right to select of land in the colony of New South Wales, for agricultural development. After initial criticisms of the company's Sydney committee over their lack of enthusiasm in finding a suitable location to use as the company's base the Port Stephens area was decided on after Robert Dawson, the company's first commissioner, arrived in Sydney on 23 December 1825 with stock, plant and equipment for the new settlement.Parry, William Edward, Sir. Early Days of Port Stephens: Extracts from Sir Edward Parry‚Äôs diary (Dungog: Dungog Chronicle; between 1940 and 1960), p5 Port Stephens had been recommended by John Oxley, the Surveyor General of New South Wales, after the AA Co's committee had insisted on a base near the coast, where shipping facilities were available. On 1 January 1826 Dawson set out to explore Port Stephens, eventually deciding on the present site of Tahlee and Carrington as a suitable place for his headquarters. During his time as commissioner, Dawson began work on Tahlee House, the home of the AA Co's first four commissioners. Nearby, a site was chosen for a township, which Mr Dawson renamed Carrington. (see \\"Carribeeen\\") Robert Dawson led the AA Co until 1828 when the committee replaced him with his assistant, Mr. James Ebsworth, in an interim capacity. William Edward Parry Sir William Edward Parry, the Arctic explorer and hydrographer, became the next commissioner of the AA Co in 1829 and arrived at Tahlee in March 1830.Parry, Edward. Memoirs of Rear-Admiral Sir WE Parry (London: Longman, Brown, Green, Longmans and Roberts; 1857) His five- year tenure was marked by progress and social reformation. Parry was a devout Christian. When he discovered that the settlement lacked a church, he conducted his own Sunday service in the carpenter's shop at Carrington. Lt- Colonel Henry Dumaresq, who had been Governor Darling's assistant, became the next commissioner in 1834. He served until his death in 1838, when Mr James Ebsworth took over again as interim commissioner. Mr Ebsworth opposed a proposal by the company's English directors to subdivide the land into small parcels. Port Stephens would be a different place today if the plan had succeeded. Phillip Parker King Captain Phillip Parker King was the final AA Co commissioner to live in Tahlee House. By then, the Company's directors had realised the land was unsuitable for grazing and chose to the relocate its headquarters to Stroud. The Australian Agricultural Company‚Äôs chapter of Tahlee‚Äôs history closed with the end of his appointment in 1849. After the Australian Agricultural Company Mr Frederick Manton, from Sydney, purchased the Tahlee property from the AA Co in 1854 for ‚Ç§2,500. However, the house burned down in 1860, leaving only the walls. The White era In 1880 Robert Hoddle Driberg White discovered he had come into a fortune when his grandmother left him considerable property in Melbourne. However, the matter had been kept a secret from him for 13 years. The subsequent court case brought him enormous wealth and notoriety. On returning to Port Stephens, Mr White was invited to stand for Parliament and was elected for the seat of Gloucester. It was during this time that he purchased Tahlee for ‚Ç§850. Considerable development took place during this period. Improvements and extensions were added to Tahlee House. Twelve full-time gardeners were employed to maintain a number of terraced gardens. Mr White was well known for bringing guests from Sydney on his steam yacht, \\"Kingfisher.\\" A horse-drawn tram would then transport them to their rooms from the harbour below the house. On his death, the estate was held in trust for his widow and then passed to their son, Alfrey Beecher Stewart White, who lived primarily in Sydney. He used Tahlee House as a country retreat. The Gospel Fishermen In 1948 the staff of the Gospel Fishermen Mission, which was located on the southern shores of Port Stephens in Tanilba Bay, visited Tahlee for a picnic. Over the next year, applications were forwarded to Mr White to rent the property to the mission. In June 1949, the Theobold family moved into the Waterfront Cottage and began using the ballroom and billiard room at Tahlee. In 1951, the ministry established a missionary training camp under the supervision of Mr Frank Biggs. Mr White continued to visit Tahlee House but, in 1959, he offered the property to the Mission, which accepted after a large donation made it possible for the purchase to take place. Tahlee Bible College and other activities on the site The first lectures at the new Tahlee Bible College commenced on 10 June 1959 and the public opening held on 31 October 1959 attracted 400 people. More than 1,000 students have trained at the college and many of these are now in Christian service in Australia and in countries all over the world. Tahlee Bible College officially discontinued operations at Tahlee in 2009 (no students were enrolled in 2008 or 2009). However several other ministries such as camps and events for children, young people and families continue to be held on site. Tours of Tahlee House and other historic buildings form part of the present activities.

It has been restored and can turn by wind. History Stansted Mountfitchet Windmill was built in 1787 for Joseph Lindsell. Lindsell sold the mill in 1807 to Henry Chaplin, who mortgaged the mill to Robert Sworder in April 1808. Chaplin died in 1844 and the mill was offered for sale by auction on 22 December 1846 without a buyer being found. In 1847, it was reported that one pair of sails required replacement. The old Common sails were replaced with a pair of Spring sails at a cost of ¬£29 4s 0d by Thomas Seabrook, millwright of Furneaux Pelham, Hertfordshire. In March 1848, it was reported that one of the remaining Common sails had blown down, and the remaining sail was not fit for further work. A pair of ‚Äúnew Patent sails‚Äù was fitted at a cost of ¬£12 5s 0d, with a new sail back costing a further ¬£5 13s 4d. In November 1848 the mill was again working on two sails, and another pair of Patent sails were fitted at a cost of ¬£23. Hicks demanded a reduction in rent from ¬£60 to ¬£45 per annum at midsummer 1850, which he was successful in obtaining. In 1850, Hicks wrote ‚ÄúThe mill has ground scarcely anything for the last month for want of wind there is great loss of time often. A windmill is not worth much with the present trade.‚Äù Hicks left the mill in 1853, and recommended William Randall Dixon to be the next tenant. Dixon took the mill on a seven-year lease at ¬£45 in May that year. A bake office was built in February 1854 at Dixon's request and the rent was increased to ¬£55. An oak stock was reported as cracked at about this time, and the mill was again reduced to two sails in September 1854 as a stock was defective. Dixon left the mill in 1856 and Edward Hicks again took the tenancy of the mill. In 1860 Hicks asked for the mill to be modernised and asked the owner to install a steam engine to assist the sails. That proposal was rejected, but a new windshaft was required and a fantail was asked for in return for an increase in rent. The cap frame was also repaired, with a new weatherbeam fitted. A new cast iron windshaft was fitted by Seabrook at a cost of ¬£25. Seabrook fitted a new fantail in that year at a cost of a further ¬£25. Hicks left the mill in June 1861, and a local man by the name of Ervin took the mill at a reduced rent of ¬£40. In 1862, millwright Fyson of Soham remodelled the machinery, converting the mill from an underdrift mill to an overdrift mill at a cost of ¬£58 13s 7d. The stage and round house were removed at this time. John Buck took the mill in 1863 at a rent of ¬£20, and reported that various work done by Fyson was faulty. Rectification was carried out by Seabrook. The mill was sold to William White in January 1865 for ¬£1,150. By 1870, the mill had four double Patent sails which were over wide. The mill last worked commercially in 1910 to crush oats. In 1930, the tower had to be strengthened with three iron bands and in 1934 the second Lord Blyth had the mill repaired and presented it to the parish. The mill served as a Scout hut from the 1940s to 1963. It was scheduled as an Ancient Monument in 1952. The mill was opened to the public for the first time in 1964, with restoration work being done in 1966. In 1984‚Äì5, the mill was repaired by Millwrights International of Mapledurham, Berkshire at a cost of ¬£14,000. The work enabled both the cap and sails to turn. In 2003, the mill was struck by lightning during an open day. In 2005, it was reported that repairs costing ¬£70,000 were needed. An appeal to local residents for support in raising money towards the repair of the mill was generally ignored, despite leafletting every house in Stansted Mountfitchet. Description Stansted Mountfitchet Windmill is a five-storey tower mill with a domed cap winded by an eight bladed fantail. The tower is diameter at base, and diameter at curb level. The brickwork is only thick at ground level, and generally only about at higher levels. This has resulted in a weak tower which required strengthening with three iron bands. Height of the tower is from ground level to curb. the cap is from curb to roof hatch, giving the mill an overall height of The cast iron windshaft is in two parts, with a separate tail section. It carries four Single Patent sails (originally double Patents, later cut down), and a wooden diameter clasp arm brake wheel of oak and elm with 99 iron segment teeth. This drives a wooden wallower with 44 teeth carried on a wooden upright shaft. The clasp arm great spur wheel is diameter, with 140 cogs. It drives three pairs of overdrift millstones. The stone nuts having 28 teeth each. As originally built, the mill had a wooden windshaft, and a stage, which was above ground level. The mill was built with four Common sails carried on a wooden windshaft. The cap was winded by hand. The mill was originally an underdrift mill, with the millstones a floor higher than they are now. A lean- to structure known as the roundhouse was attached to the mill below stage level.

Description A rocket-powered small aircraft with straight, constant-chord wings, the aircraft was to be towed or carried aloft by another aircraft and released when near enemy bombers. Igniting a Schmidding 533 solid-fuel rocket engine, it was to make a first attacking pass using the 14 nose-mounted R4M 55 mm rockets, before attempting to ram the enemy bomber's wings or tail.Luft'46 Zeppelin Rammer Germany's Secret Weapons in World War II (excerpt via Google Books) - Wood, Paul & Ford, Roger, Zenith Imprint, 2000, , p. 144 The aircraft was expected to survive the ramming of the bomber, owing to the strength of its wing which had a steel leading edge. It would have landed on a retractable skid.Michel Van Pelt, Rocketing Into the Future: The History and Technology of Rocket Planes, p. 100 Owing to the high risk for the pilot inherent in its operation this aircraft is sometimes referred to as a suicide weapon,German Suicidal Aircraft however it was originally not intended as such.

The floods mostly affected the western regions of Maharashtra state and Andhra Pradesh as well as northern Bihar. In India, the monsoon season generally lasts from June to September. According to Ministry of Home Affairs (India)'s disaster management unit, the countrywide death toll from floods in various states was 2,404 between June to September.  Early monsoon  Earlier, during the start of the monsoon season, West Bengal and Orissa were hit with heavy rains, creating a flood-like situation in the two states. The monsoon killed 100 people, mostly in the country's east and north-east. In Andhra Pradesh alone, 42 people died in a matter of two days because of sudden, heavy rains.  August flooding  In August, the Konkan region of Maharashtra experienced heavy monsoon rains, placing lives in jeopardy. Many inter-city trains between Mumbai and Pune were cancelled. Heavy waterlogging had been reported from Chiplun, Rajapur, Khed and Mahad in Maharashtra. On 10 August 2008, a major landslide caused extensive damage to a three-story building at the Sinhgad Technical Education Society's (STES) academic campus in Lonavla. A large number of passengers were reportedly stranded at various railway stations across western Maharashtra as Central Railways canceled many trains. Vehicular traffic on the Mumbai-Pune expressway was also affected due to heavy rainfall and was diverted. In Mumbai, heavy rains lashed the city and its suburbs, affecting traffic and disrupting rail services on the days of 10‚Äì11 August. In Andhra Pradesh 119 relief camps were set up in the state, most of them in the Guntur and Krishna districts. Hyderabad, Krishna district, and the East and West Godavari districts were the worst affected areas due to floods. The situation in Andhra Pradesh was more deadly as 53 people reportedly died due to floods. In Hyderabad alone 14 people were killed, when they were crushed by the collapsing roofs of their homes.  Bihar  Kosi river flood was the worst hit flood of India in 2008 The nexus of the Bihar flood is the Kosi River's immense alluvial fan, extending some 185 km from the river's exit from the Himalayas and foothills in Nepal, down to its confluence with the Ganges in Bihar. The laws of geology and physics cause rivers to course back and forth across such fans in ephemeral channels lasting decades at most, but for flood control reasons man- made embankments endeavored to contain the Koshi within a channel along its fan's western edge. On 18 August, heavy monsoon rains caused the river to break out of this channel. It started flowing through an old channel much further east, inundating cropland and towns and villages with 1.2 million inhabitants, mostly in Bihar. Chief Minister of Bihar Nitish Kumar met India Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to seek his help in dealing with the \\"catastrophe\\". The worst affected districts included Supaul, Madhepura, north Bhagalpur, Araria, Purnia (all by the Kosi) and West Champaran (by Gandak). Relief work was carried with Indian Air Force helicopters dropping relief materials in the worst hit districts. The district magistrate of Madhepura has ordered the inhabitants of the town of Madhepura to evacuate because the water level continued to rise. Relief work was carried with Indian Air Force helicopters dropping relief materials (including 600 food packets per day) from Purnia in the worst hit districts where nearly two million persons were entrapped. It is not possible to assess the magnitude of deaths or destruction, because the affected areas are totally inaccessible. Even mobile phones had stopped working, because entrapped persons cannot get their batteries charged. 150 persons were washed away in a single incident (Dainik Hindustan, Darbhanga edition). Another report says 42 people have died in the flood in Bihar. The Government of Bihar has constituted a technical committee, headed by retired engineer-in-chief of the water resource department, Nilendu Sanyal, to manage the restoration work and closure of the breach in the East Koshi afflux embankment. Indian authorities were working to prevent further widening of the breach and channels would be dug to direct the water back to the main river bed. However, Dainik Hindustan (Darbhanga edition) reported on Aug 28 that Indian officials were chased away by anti-social elements from the breach site in Nepal. Nepal's Defence Minister has made a statement that Nepal will repair the breach on its own, although it was not made clear when this work will be started. Dainik Hindustan (Darbhanga edition) later sent its reporter to the site of the Kushaha breach, who reported with photographs on Sep 5 that all earlier claims by government officials of repairing the breach and of Nepalis chasing away Indian officials were utterly false reports by Indian officials, because there were thick forests on the embankment and it was not possible to reach the site before the end of August. Forest on the embankment proves that these parts of Kosi embankments were not even visited for decades. Its maintenance was the responsibility of Indian, especially Bihar's officials. The life of these embankments elapsed over two decades ago, but no effort was taken to even survey their conditions, although the Bihar government spends huge sums on the maintenance of embankments each year. A high-level Government of Nepal team that inspected areas devastated by the flood in the Koshi River has held India responsible for the havoc. Media reports stated The devastation took place as the Indian side did not carry out repair and maintenance work on the Kosi barrage and the embankment along the river, thereby violating the Nepal-India Koshi agreement. As per the bilateral agreement of 1954 India is entirely responsible for repair and maintenance work and operation of the barrage. There was no effort by Indian officials to repair the breach in time, although the Kosi took 15 days to make the breach. On the other hand, Indian engineers say that anti-social elements in Nepal did not allow them to repair the embankment (Dainik Hindustan, Darbhanga edition, Aug 28). These so-called \\"anti-social\\" elements are the victims of the Kosi embankments who have been forced to bear tsunami-like floods every year; they are happy that the river wants to change its course. Kosi embankments are designed to contain the Kosi in the channel of the Tilyuga River, while the old course of the Kosi lies far to the east in Purnia district. Later, Dainik Hindustan reported on Sep 5 that Indian officials could not reach the site of breach as there were forests on the embankment which were cleared in early September, hence Indian officials were lying about being prevented to repair the breach: they had not visited the site for decades due to forests in the way. The New York Times reported that it is the worst flood in the area in 50 years, prompting Manmohan Singh to declare a ‚Äúnational calamity‚Äù on 28 August. The government earmarked US$230 million in aid for the region.nytimes.com, Floods in India May Displace Millions The Indian Army, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and non-governmental organizationsUpdate from Medha Patkar of Narmada Bachao on Flood Relief and Donations operated the biggest flood rescue operation in India in more than 50 years.

Kaziranga National Park, which has the highest density of rhinos in the world, was 90% submerged in water. Also, Pobitra national park in Assam was flooded. Two rhinos have died in these floods. A tiger has killed one rhino calf. In addition, four deer and one elephant have also failed to survive. The flood situation has affected estimated 2.1 million people and caused 24 deaths so far. Worst affected districts are Dhubri, Jorhat, Kamrup, Lakhimpur, Dhemaji and Morigaon. Thousands of people are staying in makeshift shelters with the government providing food and other essentials to the displaced people, besides healthcare facilities. Indian officials say that the flooding situation could cause an epidemic, because refugees are consuming unclean water and food in shelters. Breaches in embankments have caused these floods in Assam. Four embankments on the Puthimari River, one constructed just three months ago, were breached causing the calamity. Waters have breached embankments at total 54 vital locations, and water levels are dangerously high in about 10 points.

He became wealthy off oil and gas. The race saw personal attacks on Huffington's wife, Arianna Huffington, who was very involved in the race (the media dubbed her the \\"Sir Edmund Hillary of social climbing,\\" according to The Almanac of American Politics). Huffington was called a hypocrite for supporting Proposition 187 and then breaking the law for employing illegal aliens, a story which came out in the race's final days. A grand total of $44 million was spent in the election. At the time, it was the most expensive campaign in a non-presidential election in American history. Chris Cillizza of The Washington Post named the election one of the nastiest senate elections in modern history.  Results  On election day it was a very close race, but Feinstein won Los Angeles County, which may have pulled her ahead. Her sizable win in the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area may also be credited to her slim statewide victory. A large number of absentee ballots left the results in doubt for over two weeks. On November 18, Senator Feinstein declared victory. At that time, she was ahead by 147,404 votes, with only 156,210 remaining uncounted ballots. Huffington had not conceded at that point, saying that there was evidence of voter fraud and calling for an investigation. He had already filed a legal complaint, which had already been dismissed.

It was commissioned by Tsar Alexis I to protect Russian trading ships on the Caspian Sea and became the first Russian-built warship. The ship was built between 1667 and 1669 by the developing shipyard in Dedinovo on the Oka River. Although Oryol was captured and burned in 1670, it has achieved lasting importance as a symbol of the birth of Russian naval power. Oryol is often considered the first Russian sailing ship of Western European type, even though Frederick (or Friedrich) was built in 1636 in Nizhny Novgorod. However, Frederick sailed in the service of Holstein-Gottorp, not Russia, having been constructed as a joint venture using Russian labor and materials, but Holstein funds and expertise. Construction During the 17th century, Russia and Persia developed closer commercial ties, exchanging extravagant embassies and trading in cloth, silk, and other goods. Shipping was conducted across the Caspian Sea and through the Volga River, with Astrakhan as commercial center. This route served to open Persia to commerce not only with Russia but with all of Europe; Dutch and English traders were active, and Adam Olearius was sent as an emissary from Schleswig-Holstein. In order to protect this growing trade, Tsar Alexis I ordered a naval shipbuilding program. The shipyard was constructed south-east of Moscow in Dedinovo, a town on the Oka River in present-day Moscow Oblast. The project was placed under the Novgorod Chancery, supervised by the boyar Afanasy Ordin-Nashchokin. Experienced sailors were hired from Amsterdam, and Karnelius van Bockhoiven, a Dutchman living in Moscow, was hired for his shipbuilding expertise. Oryol was the first large ship produced, along with a yacht and two smaller vessels. It was a three- masted sailing ship, in length, wide, and displacing . It had a crew of 23 sailors and 35 soldiers, and was armed with 22 guns. Although Oryol was launched in 1668, it was not yet finished and spent the winter at dock in Dedinovo. It finally left the shipyard on May 7, 1669, under the command of the Dutch captain David Butler (Davidt Jansz Butlaer). The warship sailed down the Volga to its base in Astrakhan, from which it would protect shipping on the Caspian Sea. Coenraad Decker. Frigate Oryol in Astrakhan. The spire of the Admiralty in Saint Petersburg, topped by golden ship weather-vane. The sailing-ship emblem from the top of the spire. Destruction Oryol arrived in Astrakhan in August 1669, but never fulfilled its mission and may never have sailed on the Caspian Sea. The rebel forces of Stenka Razin were raiding Russian towns, and the ship's guns and men were ordered to defend Astrakhan while the ship sat at anchor. Some of the ship's guns were removed to the citadel, and when the Cossacks attacked the city in June 1670, Oryol was at anchor and undefended. The rebels took the ship and either burned it or disabled and abandoned it in a channel of the river. Captain Butler's own account of the occupation of Astrakhan and the destruction of Oryol was published in 1683 along with the voyages of the Dutch traveler Jan Struys. Symbolic significance The image of a sailing ship at the top of the Admiralty spire in Saint Petersburg bears a strong resemblance to, and may have been modeled after Oryol. The original golden weather-vane, work of the Dutch master Harmen van Bol'es, remained in place until 1886, when it was moved to the Admiralty's naval museum and replaced with an exact copy. The three-masted ship has become an emblem of the city of Saint Petersburg. The earliest record of the Russian white, blue, and red tricolor comes from the flag flown on Oryol. This flag was later made standard for all Russian ships by Peter the Great. There are several traditional explanations for the choice of colors. According to one version, the design was based on the Dutch flag in honor of the ship's builders and crew. Alternatively, the three colors may have been taken from the insignia of the Grand Duchy of Moscow.

The new framework is guided by the following principles: * Reducing risks at the source by requiring all stakeholders to eliminate or minimise the risks they create; * Instilling greater ownership of safety and health outcomes within the industries; and * Preventing accidents through higher penalties for compromises in safety management.  The Workplace Safety and Health Act  The Workplace Safety and Health Act (WSHA) is the key legislation affecting the principles of the OSH framework. The WSHA emphasises the importance of managing Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) proactively, by requiring stakeholders to take reasonably practicable measures that ensure the safety and health of all individuals affected in the course of work. The WSHA replaces the Factories Act. The key reforms under the WSHA include: * Allowing for a gradual increase in scope to cover all workplaces; * Assigning responsibilities to a range of stakeholders at the workplace along lines of control; * Focusing more on WSH systems and outcomes; * Providing for more effective enforcement through the issuance of \\"remedial orders\\"; and * Providing for higher penalties for non-compliant and risk-taking behaviour, to prevent accidents at the source.

Life After completing his theological studies in Rome he was appointed professor in the College of Fribourg, Switzerland, in 1809. From 1816 he was professor of Scripture and dogmatic theology in the ecclesiastical seminary of Li√®ge. His teaching in this institution was taxed with heterodoxy, and in 1823 he was removed and made pastor of Engis. Shortly afterward, and against the will of his ecclesiastical superiors, he accepted the chair of anthropology and metaphysics in the philosophical college of the Catholic University of Leuven. He retained this position until the Revolution of 1830, when the college was suppressed. Works His international reputation rested mainly on his first publication, \\"Hermeneutica Sacra seu Introductio in omnes et singulos libros sacros Veteris et Novi Foederis.\\" Published in 1818, it was written during his time at Fribourg. A French translation of this work, the original of which had reached its nineteenth edition in 1897, was published by Pacaud as early as 1828. A fifth edition of this translation, edited by Glaire and Sionnet, was published in Paris in 1855.

The film is set in the 21st century, where Romans have found a new way to handle criminals: by having them fight each other like gladiators on motorcycles on national television. The film was based on a trend of Italian cinema to develop stories of futuristic barbarians after the popularity of the films Mad Max and Escape from New York. Plot In the year 2072, set in a dystopia Rome, Italy, WBS TV's chief of programming, Cortez (Claudio Cassinelli), is fuming at the constituently high ratings enjoyed by a rival American TV show, 'Kill-Bike'. The show has features gladiatorial fights to the death on motorcycles, and has made a hero of a man called Drake (Jared Martin) the unbeaten champion. Cortez is all the more bitter because it was he who discovered Drake in the first place. WBS's current answer to the American show is 'The Danger Game', a simulation game showing the hallucinations of a contestant experiencing the approach of violent death. Fear, panic, and screaming at the extremely realistic simulations triggers a further increase in the intensity. Unfortunately for the station, even this spectacle fails to compete against the American show. Cortez and his two female assistants, Sybil (Penny Brown) and Sarah (Eleonora Brigliadori) receive a video message from the mysterious station boss, Sam, demanding that they recreate the formula of gladiatorial contest and set them back to where they began: in the Coliseum. Sam orders the WBS station, a sort-of flying saucer controlled by a computer system called Junior, to fly over there and initiate training of the future contestants who will be chosen from the Death Rows around the world. Meanwhile, Drake has been imprisoned for the murder of three men who killed his wife Susan (Valerie Jones) after they broke into his house, and he (conveniently for WBS) is now under the sentence of death for taking the law in his own hands. Drake is brought to the training compound and a detector strip is seared into his wrist. There, he has to contend with the sadistic Chief of the Praetorian Guard, Raven (Howard Ross), and the hostility of the other future contestants. Some of them are introduced; Abdul (Fred Williamson) is an African-American Muslim extremist; Akira (Haruiko Yamanouchi) is a notorious Japanese serial killer; Kirk (Al Cliver) is a German-born robber/killer; and Tango (Tony Sanders) is a Latin American terrorist. Drake also meets an old friend of his from his WBS days, a deformed employee with a fiber optic eye called Monk (Donald O'Brien), who offers Drake some reassurance. The next day, Drake is strapped into a 'hate stimulator' device, designed to measure the point when man can be provoked into murder. Despite the best efforts of the machine, which creates holographic images of his wife's killers taunting him, Drake does not crack. Cortez's assistant, Sarah, is perturbed by this and becomes attracted to the prisoner. Drake soon earns the respect of the other prisoners after facing off in a battle of wits with the vicious Raven, who is impotent to actually harm the prisoners because of the upcoming TV show. Sarah meets and befriends Drake and shows him videotape evidence she has discovered that proves he was set up for his wives murder merely to get him on the show. A strangely powerful microprocessor smuggled in by Monk facilities an escape attempt. When it fails, footage of Drake and the other prisoners in their escape attempt turns up immediately on the TV news. Who is the mystery cameraman? Raven is given limited access to torture the prisoners with electric shocks. But the harrowing experience bonds the principle gladiators even more. Meanwhile, Cortez is becoming more enraged by Sarah's investigation of Drake. The following evening, Sarah visits Professor Towman (Cosimo Cinieri), the inventor of Junior, the WBS computer system, looking for a way to gain access to the restricted files. The professor has become a mystic and talks about his invention's soul. Professor Towman gives Sarah a pass-chip to access the computer when he is suddenly murdered by an unseen assailant. Sarah gives chase and sees that the killer is Sybil. But before Sarah can try to capture Sybil, she too is shot and killed by an unseen assailant. Meanwhile, the WBS Gladiator Contest commences, with each contesting racing around the modified arena in modified motorcycle carts fighting in a chariot-like run. Many contestants are killed, including Tango. Suddenly, Sarah interrupts the games by riding into the arena on a motorcycle. She has discovered from the computer chip that Junior will trigger the bracelet devices of all the surviving gladiators to kill them all 20 minutes after the show ends. Revealing this information to Drake and the rest of the men, they mount an attack on the control tower, killing all the guards, including Raven. But most of the gladiators, including Akira, are killed in the assault. Drake, Sarah, Abdul and Kirk break into the main control room and discover that Cortez is found to have plotted the death of the survivors in order to discredit Sam and take over as station head. Cortez is killed by Abdul who shoots him. Then, a computer screen image of the company boss, Sam, appears and informs them that 'Sam' is really just a video projection of the computer, emanating from a space satellite orbiting 200,000 miles above the Earth. The computer knew of Cortez plan but let it happen to a point. The four surviving rebels force entry into the main terminal of 'Sam', with the aid of Sarah's pass key. But Kirk is killed when he unwisely tries to remove his bracelet himself. Then, the three surviving rebels are attacked in the control room by Monk, who is revealed to be the traitor who filmed the escape attempt with a mini-camera built into his eye. After a bitter fight, Drake kills him and Sarah uses some of the information stored on his camera chip to access the destruction codes. In the nick of time, Sam is blown up, and the deadly bracelets are deactivated. With the battle won, Drake and Sarah fly off together in a hover-vehicle to start a new life for themselves.

Following the release of these films, Italian cinema produced films such as Enzo G. Castellari's 1990: The Bronx Warriors and The New Barbarians, Ruggero Deodato's The Raiders of Atlantis and Bruno Mattei's Rats: Night of Terror. The story for the film was devised by the husband and wife team of Dardano Sacchetti and Elisa Briganti. Fulci felt story by Sacchetti was strong and but was not happy with producers suggestions, which included to add skyscrapers to scenes where Fulci had envisioned a futuristic Rome covered by gigantic Plexiglas domes. The production was originally planned to be part of two-film deal, with Fulci's next project to be Blastfighter. Sacchetti explained that Fulci had had an argument with the production and had been taken to court. The title of the film had been sold, but they were no longer able to use the script, which lead to Blastfighter having its title but a completely different story. The completed script of Warriors of the Year 2072 was edited further by Cesare Frugoni and Fulci himself. The film would mark the last time Sacchetti would work with Fulci who he claimed had stolen his idea for a film to be titled Evil Comes Back. Sacchetti denied these allegations, stating that Fulci was originally excited over his drafts and had it read to a producer who commissioned him for a script. The film would later be made by Lamberto Bava under the title Until Death. Release Warriors of the Year 2072 was released in Italy on January 28, 1984. It was released on DVD as The New Gladiators by Troma Video on August 7, 2001. The film has been released under several titles, including Rome 2072 A.D.: The New Gladiators, Fighting Centurions. Troy Howarth, in his biography on Fulci stated the film is often referred to as The New Gladiators.

These compounds generally have the formula L2Mg2, where L represents a bulky ligand. The first examples of these stable magnesium(I) compounds were reported in 2007. The chemistry of Mg is dominated by the +2 oxidation state and prior to 2007 only examples of crystalline compounds with short Mg-Mg distances that may indicate an Mg-Mg bond were known, such as the ternary metal hydrides Mg2RuH4, Mg3RuH3, and Mg4IrH5 and magnesium diboride, Calculations had also indicated the stability of the Mg22+ cation. The preparation of the first compounds made involved the reduction of MgII iodine complexes with potassium metal and the bulky ligands were: * a guanidinate, \\"priso\\", [(Ar)NC(NPri2)N(Ar)]‚àí where Ar = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl and Pri = iso-propyl * a ketiminate, \\"nacnac\\", {[(Ar)NC(Me)]2CH}‚àí,- where Ar = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl and Me = methyl Both examples have the formula L2Mg2, where L represents the bulky anionic bidentate ligand. X-ray crystallographic studies showed an Mg-Mg bond length of 285.1 pm and 284.6 pm. Theoretical studies indicate an essentially ionic formulation Mg22+(L‚àí)2. The Mg22+ ion is the group 2 analogue of the group 12 Hg22+ (present in e.g. mercury(I) chloride) and Cd22+ ions (present in cadmium(I) tetrachloroaluminate).

The cabinet was probably made in Florence for the diarist John Evelyn (1620-1706),The John Evelyn Cabinet, from Victoria & Albert Museum. and is an early example of a piece of furniture commissioned by a British visitor making the 'Grand Tour' of Europe. Objects often acquire their fame because of who owned them, but what makes this cabinet unusual is that its physical appearance was the result of elements already owned by the man who commissioned it. The cabinet was expressly made to incorporate 19 pietre dure (hardstone) panels, which Evelyn purchased in Florence from their maker, Domenico Benotti (active 1630-50), in 1644. The base of the cabinet was later heightened (probably in Paris) to accommodate the addition of a series of bronze plaques, probably made in Florence by Francesco Fanelli (active 1610-42). Evelyn's Diary was first published in the early 1800s, more than a century after his death. The national recognition he achieved in turn gave the cabinet new significance, and it was further embellished with gilt brass mounts, decorated with amorini and swags, the strawberry leaf cresting, and provided with its stand. On Evelyn's return from the Grand Tour, the cabinet was probably housed in Dover Street, London. Soon after Evelyn's death in 1706 it was moved to his country residence, Wotton House in Wotton, Surrey. In 1813, John Evelyn's diaries were discovered in an 'ebony cabinet' at Wotton House, quite possibly this one.

It is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Malaysia to be visited and explored for its food, coffee and historical prewar buildings. It was recently declared as the royal town of Johor by Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar and is the fourth largest city (after Johor Bahru, Batu Pahat and Kluang) in Johor. It is the main and biggest town of the bigger entity region or area of the same name, Muar which is sub- divided into the Muar district and the new Tangkak district, which was upgraded into a full-fledged district from the Tangkak sub-district earlier.Muar to say goodbye to Tangkak , 20 November 2006, The Star (Malaysia) Muar district as the only district covering the whole area formerly borders Malacca in the northern part. Upon the upgrading of Tangkak (formerly Ledang) district, the Muar district now covers only the area south of Sungai Muar, whilst the northern area beyond the river is in within Tangkak district. However, both divided administrative districts are still collectively and fondly called and referred to as the region or area of Muar as a whole by their residents and outsiders. Currently, the new township of Muar is located in the Bakri area. Muar is one of the cleanest cities in South East Asia, being awarded with Asean Clean Tourist City Standard Award 2017 recently.  Etymology  Muar also known as Bandar Maharani is said to have had other names earlier and the name itself Muar is believed to have originated and derived from its geographical location at the mouth or estuary of Muar River as the following different version of theories: * Teluk Dalam :Muar was formerly known as Teluk Dalam meaning \\"deep bay\\" due to its location at the estuary or the structure of the mouth of the Muar River which is wide open and deep; based on a sentence in one part of Hikayat Malim Deman; as in : :Muar belum bernama Muar , Muar bernama Teluk Dalam. (Muar has not been named Muar, Muar is called Teluk Dalam) * Muara :Muar name is said to be the summary for this old Malay word Muara meaning \\"the wide open estuary\\". * Muak :Means \\"bored\\" or \\"tired\\" in paddling the boat travelling along the river which is large and curvy by the local people in the early days. The people started calling the river and place Muar deriving from the word Muak after a long time since then. * Bukit Mor :There is also a hill not far from the Muar near Parit Jawa in the south of the \\"Padang\\" area called Mor Hill or Bukit Mor which may be the origin of the name of Muar. * Bandar Maharani :Modern Muar Town was officially opened and conferred Bandar Maharani title by Maharaja Abu Bakar translated as the Town of Empress the namesake of Maharani Fatimah who also graced the grand inauguration ceremony of the new town on 12 August 1887, to symbolically representing and recognising the prominence status of Muar as the 2nd important and biggest town and district of the state of Johor after Johor Bahru the capital city in those days. There a few old historic legends which evolved around the area of Muar namely, Hikayat Malim Deman (Epic of Malim Deman), Legenda Lembing Awang Pulang Ke Dayang (Awang's Spear Return to Dayang Legend) and Legenda Puteri Gunung Ledang (Mount Ledang Princess' Legend).  History  Formerly Flag of the State Commissioner for Muar (); Flag and coat of arms of JohorFlag of the State Commissioner for Muar (Bendera Orang Besar Daerah Muar) Muar is rich in history as mentioned in many historical records and archaeological works. It is believed that the history of Muar started much earlier than the Sultanate of Malacca. There were many accounts recorded about the early history of Muar. In 1361, it was claimed that Muar was a part of the Majapahit empire. Another account also stated that Parameswara, upon his exile from Temasik before proceeding to found Melaka, had established a settlement at Kota Buruk, Pagoh, Ulu Muar, Muar witnessing the beginning of the Malacca Sultanate empire. Historically, Muar was also where the deposed heir of the Malacca Sultanate escaped to in 1511 following the invasion of the Portuguese, launched from Goa. During the Portuguese's Afonso de Albuquerque invasion and attack in 1511, Muar played a role in resisting the Portuguese occupation of Malacca; the Kubu Bentayan fort was built by the last Sultan of Malacca, Sultan Mahmud to repel seaborne invasions, before he was defeated and retreat further to Pagoh, this time witnessing the fall of the Malacca Sultanate empire. During the Portuguese occupation era, the Portuguese built a fortress named Fortaleza de Muar to defend the colony against the attack of Dutch and Aceh instead at the same strategic site of Bentayan. The colonial British did just about the same thing at the Muar River site near Bentayan in defence against the advance of Japanese Imperial Army in the Battle of Muar in World War II . Muar is also the home for the one and only tomb of the 7th Malacca Sultanate, Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah I (1477‚Äì1488). During the time of the beginning of Bugis immigration from Sulawesi Indonesia and their influence in Johor Sultanate, the five Bugis pioneer prince-brothers sea-warriors or rather pirates from Sulawesi, Indonesia; Daeng Marewah, Daeng Parani, Daeng Celak, Daeng Manambun and Daeng Kemasi said to have come to reside in Liang Batu, Lenga, Muar before they and their descendants become the influential Temenggungs and even rulers later. Muar, the Bandar Maharani, have been recorded by several historians, scholars and authors and in many important historical materials like old maps, poems, epics, manuscripts and books : * Prapanca (1361) (Nagarakertagama Poem) :Nagarakertagama poem ‚Äì written in 1361 Prapanca (a Buddhist monk and priest of Majapahit Palace) told Muar as a colony part of Majapahit empire subdued by Hayam Wuruk and prime minister, Gajah Mada(1350 to 1389).The story is recorded in JMBRAS magazine, October 1935, Volume XIII Part 2, page 15 to 16. * Jo√£o de Barros (\\"Decades of Asia\\"), (1553) :Jo√£o de Barros who wrote in 1553 in his 2nd D√©cadas da √Åsia (\\"Decades of Asia\\"), a history of the Portuguese in India and Asia.stated that Parameswara (Paramicura) who were driven away from Temasik after he killed the representative of the King of Siam, Temagi; had escaped in exile and stopped in Muar and built a in rural areas of Muar called Pagoh. * Tun Sri Lanang (Malay Annals) Shellabear version :In the Malay Annals states that Temasik during the reign of Parameswara(Sultan Iskandar Shah) was defeated by Majapahit Kingdom. But he and his family including his followers had fled to Pagoh, Muar and opened 2 areas on the banks of the Muar River; the Biawak Busuk and another fort called Kota Buruk before moved to Melaka and opened up Melaka. In 1488, the incident of Malacca's Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah I (1477‚Äì1488) who has died and buried in Pagoh, Ulu Muar during a visit, called \\"Sultan Mangkat Di Muar\\". * Tom√© Pires (the Suma Oriental) (1512‚Äì1515) :Tom√© Pires wrote a landmark book on Asian trade, the Suma Oriental que trata do Mar Roxo at√© aos Chins (Summa of the East, from the Red Sea up to the Chinese) in Malacca and India between 1512‚Äì1515, completed before the death of Afonso de Albuquerque (December 1515), which highlighted the emergence of Parameswara replacing his father, Raja Sam Agi as the ruler of Palembang and later attacked by the king of Majapahit of Java, King Batara Tamavill for declaring himself as 'Mjeura'(those who dare) before fled to Temasik(Singapore)where he killed Siamese King of Ayutthaya's representative, Temagi and he secretly ruled Temasik for 5 years. But fearing the revenge attack by the King of Ayutthaya, he fled to Pagoh, Muar with his 1,000 followers and lived there for 6 years when the Seletar peoples were still occupying Malacca before he moved to Malacca and opened it later. * An old Portuguese map shows that Muar had a second Portuguese fort in the Peninsular Malaysia beside Malacca. From the map, it was named Fortaleza de Muar built in 1604 by Emanuel Godinho de Er√©dia in triangular shape to defend the colony against attacks from the Dutch and Aceh, at the mouth of Bentayan River near the Muar River. It fort has since vanished but it is believed to be located at the present location of Bentayan Express Bus' Station (formerly Pagoh Bus Stand) in Jalan Maharani, Muar. * Abraham Ortelius (1584) (Old Maps) :Old maps such as Map Ortelius A.D. 1584 shows Muar as a city located to the south of Malacca. * Jan Huyghen van Linschoten (1595) (Old Maps) :Map Linschoten A.D. 1595 shows Muar as a city close to the state of Malacca. Sultan Ali's Rule of Muar: Muar was the royal town of northern Johor once. A civil war between the prince of Sultan Hussein Shah; Tengku Ali dan Dato' Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim which was later settled by a treaty of agreement and understanding signed in Singapore between the British and Tengku Ali; that ceded the control of the rest of state of Johor (except Muar region) formally to Temenggong Ibrahim in returns of the sultan title with the condition the title is not hereditary for succession, and recognition of him as Sultan Ali and his reign ruled over the Muar region(state) of the area lies between the Muar River and Kesang River with an annual pension from the British Government under the terms of the treaty. Although Sultan Ali was in fact the real heir of the Johor Sultanate but due to his weakness, the Temenggong became the de facto ruler instead and begin the rule of the Temenggung in Johor onwards. Sultan Ali delegated the administrative affairs of Muar to the Raja Temenggung of Muar(Tun) Suzana (Tun) Othman, Ahlul-bait (keluarga) Rasulullah SAW & raja-raja Melayu, pg 182 (also known by the title of Temenggong Paduka Tuan of Muar)R. O. Winstedt, A History of Johore (1365‚Äì1941), pg 129 and rather spent most of his time in Malacca. Muar was sparsely populated in 1855 and had a population of 800 and no formal structure of government was formed. In 1860, Sultan Ali reportedly borrowed $53,600 from a Chettiar money lender, Kavana Chana Shellapah and signed an agreement with Shellapah to contribute a portion of his monthly allowance to repay his debt. However, Sultan Ali found himself unable to pay settle his debts in time, and an angry Shellapah wrote to the British government in 1866. Pressured to liquidate his debts in time, Sultan Ali granted Shellapah the right to trade off Muar to the Raja Temenggung of MuarTemenggong of Johor as mortgage if he is unable to pay off his debts in time.Studer, American and British Claims Arbitration: William Webster: Appendix to the Memorial of the United States, Vol. III, p. 311-12 His relations with Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim remained strained; in 1860, Sultan Ali allowed a Bugis adventurer, Suliwatang, the chiefs of Rembau and Sungei Ujong to settle in Muar and prepare themselves for an attack on Johor.Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society (1937), p. 74 Such bad blood between the Sultan Ali and Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim passed down to the Temenggong's son, Temenggong Abu Bakar, who succeeded his father after the former died in 1862. Shortly after Temenggong Abu Bakar became the Temenggong of Johor, he sent a letter to Sultan Ali to reassert of Johor's sovereignty over Segamat. Continued disputes over the sovereignty of Segamat led to an outbreak of a war between the Temenggong's men with the Sultan's. Eleven years later in 1873, attempts made by Suliwatang to collect custom taxes from inhabitants at the Muar estuary led to further conflict with Temenggong Abu Bakar's (who became Maharaja in 1868 and finally Sultan later in 1885, 8 years after death of Sultan Ali) men.Winstedt, A History of Johore (1365‚Äì1941), p. 128-29 Upon Sultan Ali's death in Umbai, Malacca in 1877, his 11-year-old youngest son, Tengku Mahmood, was named his successor, fuelling anger and dissatisfaction of his oldest son, Tengku Alam Shah. The Raja Temenggung of Muar (also known by the title of Temenggong Paduka Tuan of Muar) and its village chieftains voted in favour of a merger of Muar with Johor following the succession dispute between the two of Sultan Ali's sons. Tengku Alam Shah, disputed the legitimacy of the chieftains' wishes and staked his hereditary claims over Muar, started to instigate and launch the 1879 Jementah Civil War in a bid to reclaim Muar, but was quickly defeated by the Maharaja Abu Bakar's forces and Muar was finally annexed and return as part of the Johor state on 30 December 1879. During the 1880s, the sovereign rulers of Johor, Temenggong Ibrahim and his successor, Sultan Abu Bakar introduced the Kangchu system and actively encouraged the Chinese leaders to set up new gambier and black pepper plantations and to bring in the Chinese immigrants as agricultural settlers and labourers to open and work in these plantations in Muar.Winstedt, A History of Johore (1365‚Äì1941), pg 131-2 A Western-style contracts (termed as Surat Sungai in Malay, literally \\"River Documents\\") to the Kapitan Cina (Chinese leaders) who have established the plantations along river banks in Johor. Letters of authority (Surat Kuasa) were issued when the first Chinese leaders began settling in Johor during the 1850s. The Temenggong quickly established goodwill relations with the Kapitan Cina by appointing one Malay administrator, Muhamad Salleh bin Perang, the Dato' Bentara Luar who was able to speak the Teochew dialect, the language spoken by most Kapitan Cina and settlers and able to read Chinese for these purposes.Andaya, A History of Malaysia, p. 140 Influx of these settlers mainly of Teochew origin, and were generally first- or second-generation ethnic Chinese who became an important part and parcel of life and population of Muar until today and helped shape the population demographic and the social economy of Muar. There is even a town called Bukit Gambir meaning Hill of Gambier in Muar. Modern Muar Town, known as Bandar Maharani, which is the main city center of Muar district, was founded by Dato' Bentara Luar, Muhamad Salleh bin Perang in 1885 and was only officially opened by His Majesty Maharaja Abu Bakar 12 August 1887 (who just became opted Maharaja title on 30 June 1868) and conferred the namesake Bandar Maharani meaning the Town of Empress, the title of Maharani Fatimah who had accompanied to graced the inauguration ceremony of the new town at Tangga Batu a place around Hentian Maharani bus station now where an auspicious \\"amulet\\" or \\"azimat\\" is said to be buried underground there then. Muar celebrated its centenary in a grand celebration attended by the Sultan of Johor in 1984.Sultanah Johor Tanam Azimat di Muar The prosperity and rapid development of Muar made it the only town in Malaysia ever to have had its own local railway network in the early days. The Muar State Railway (MSR) operated from 1889‚Äì1925, linking Jalan Sulaiman in Bandar Maharani and Sungai Pulai for a distance of 22.5 km. A 1916 plan to extend the line to Batu Pahat was aborted and the service totally stopped in 1925 due to financial and geographical constraints and its reduced importance after the construction of Jalan Abdul Rahman linking the Muar town and Parit Jawa. It remains a memory and is only a part of history of Muar now with just the MSR steam locomotive relic on display at Tanjung Emas Park. The Muar Ferry Crossing, in the Battle of Muar, where the 45th Indian Brigade was disposed along 24 miles of river front with four companies of infantry north of the river and the remainder positioned south of the river, to cover the main coast road at Muar against the advance of the Imperial Guards Division.The Battle of Muar In World War II , the Battle of Muar, 14‚Äì22 January 1942, fought around the area from Gemencheh, Muar River and Bukit Bakri in Muar was the last major battle of the Malayan Campaign of the Battle of Malaya, fought by British Allied forces and Japanese forces from 8 December 1941 ‚Äì 31 January 1942 in British Malaya. The Battle of Bakri or Siege of Bakri was a fierce battle of the fighting troops in Bukit Bakri on 17 January 1942. The battle resulted in the near-annihilation of the Allies' deployed 45th Indian Infantry Brigade, with heavy casualties for its two attached Australian's 2/19th and 2/29th Infantry Battalions and the eventual fall of Muar to the Imperial Japanese forces. During the 1942‚Äì45 Japanese occupation of Malaya era, Muar continued to serve as important administration town under the occupying Japanese army with many locals involved in the bulk of anti-Japanese resistance groups such as the Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army (MPAJA) and Force 136. During the Malayan Emergency period, in the Bukit Kepong Incident, the police station of Bukit Kepong was ambushed and brutally attacked by members of the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), the military arm of the Malayan Communist Party, on 23 February 1950 killing 26 policemen and family members. Muar also recorded the history of resistance against the communist attacks and British occupation by Panglima Kiyai Salleh, a religious and martial arts teacher of Banjarese & Javanese origin who founded the resistance guerillas troop Tentera Selempang Merah. The Group of Seven or Orang Tujuh of Muar which consists of Tun Dr Awang Hassan (the former Governor of Penang), father of Tun Dr Ismail Dato Abdul Rahman Mohd Yasin (father of Tun Dr Ismail former Deputy Prime Minister), his brother Datuk Sulaiman Abdul Rahman, Tan Sri Datuk Hassan (former Menteri Besar) and Dato Hj Kosai Mohd Salleh was said to be active fighting the formation of Malayan Union and advocating the independence of Malaya.  Geography  Bandar Maharani in Muar District NASA's Spaceborne radar image (SAR) shows the city of Muar is at the center of the left edge of the image at the mouth of the Muar River (Sungai Muar). Muar district formerly covers 2346.12 km2, with a population of 328,695 (2000). The town of Muar is located at the mouth of Muar River. The flat terrain of Muar's geographical ground and areas has enable the extensive use of bicycle and tricycle vehicles as the main and major mode of transportation in Muar in the early days. This believe to be the main factor and reason Muar was once the town with the most bicycles and the only town that requires valid license issued by the town council to own and use a bicycle in the country.  Climate  Muar, like the rest of peninsular Malaysia, enjoys a year-round equatorial climate which is warm and sunny, along with plentiful rainfall, especially during the southwest monsoon from April to September. The climate is very much dictated by the adjacent sea and the wind system. In the 2006/2007 floods, unusually heavy rainfall in the states of Johor and Melaka resulted in the worst flooding in southern Peninsular Malaysia in history. Muar was not spared from this dreadful disaster which lasted almost a month. Many areas of Muar such as Pagoh, Lenga, Kundang Ulu, Bukit Gambir and Sawah Ring were seriously flooded with some areas up to . About 22,933 people were evacuated to relief centresThe Star, 25 December 2006.  Administration  Muar Municipal Council Muar District was formerly divided administratively into Muar (Bandar Maharani) municipality and Tangkak township. Upon upgrade of Tangkak sub- district to full-fledged Tangkak district, Bandar Maharani of Muar is now administered by Muar Municipal Council (formerly South Muar Town Council, later Muar Town Council) under the Muar District Office, while Tangkak is administered by Tangkak Town Council (formerly North Muar Town Council) under the Tangkak District Office. A new administration hub and transportation hub integrated with bus terminal and market called Maharani Sentral are being planned to be built at the location near Muar Bypass in between Jalan Haji Kosai and Jalan Temenggung.  Transportation  Car Besides federal roads such as highway that runs through Muar town centre, Muar is also accessible via the PLUS Expressway through the Tangkak (EXIT 235), Bukit Gambir (EXIT 236), Pagoh (EXIT 238) and Yong Peng (EXIT 241) interchange exits. Access to Segamat, the closest railway station to Muar, is possible using highway . Sultan Ismail Bridge, the first bridge across the Muar River is the landmark of the town, built in 1960 and completed in 1962 to replace old ferry services in the 1960s. The new Muar Second Bridge connecting Parit Bunga at the north and Sabak Awor at the south across the river is part of the 13 km Muar Bypass (highway ) that was completed in 2005. The bridge is the latest landmark of the town. The highway that traverses through the outskirts of the town has ease the journey by diverting the traffic from downtown Muar. Muar with status as an important trading and administrative town in the state of Johor for both the colonial British and the old Johor Sultanate in the early days has contributed in shaping the landscape of the town. Public transportation Bandar Maharani Ferry Terminal The state railway KTMB does not serve Muar or its environs; instead the closest station is in Segamat. Train services to the state capital Johor Bahru as well as Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh, Seremban or Tumpat in Kelantan are available. There are also express bus coaches to all the nearby towns and the major cities of Malaysia including Kuala Lumpur, Johor Bahru, Melaka City, Kuantan, Ipoh, George Town etc. and also Singapore and Hat Yai (south Thailand). There are two bus stations in Muar; Hentian Maharani Bus Station and Bentayan Express Bus Station (formerly Pagoh Bus Station). Ferry services to Dumai, Sumatra, Indonesia is also available on regular basis, departing from the Custom Jetty. Muar is the only district (besides the state capital Johor Bahru) in Johor that has its own Custom and Excise Duty Department office and checkpoint at its own jetty. By air, the nearest airport is arguably the Batu Berendam airport in Malacca. The Senai Airport is further away, being closer to Johor Bahru than Muar. Traveling in town easily can be done by walking, or by taking a trishaw, public bus and taxi.  Telecommunication and postal service  Muar as well as Tangkak are assigned the calling code prefix +60-6 (which follows Malacca and Negeri Sembilan) instead of +60-7 which is used in the rest of Johor. The coverage of reception signal are extensive in all the Muar area for all the major mobile telecommunication service provider companies. Postal district 84xxx covers Muar, Tangkak, Pagoh and surroundings.  Economy  Muar Trade Centre Muar is internationally well known as the hub of the furniture industry of Malaysia. Industrial estates within Muar district are located at Tanjung Agas, Bukit Bakri, Jorak, Parit Bakar, Pagoh and Tangkak. There are notably three big factories of multinational companies, i.e. STMicroelectronics, Micron Technology and Pioneer Corporation at Tanjung Agas. The town is robust of business and trading activities, with many old traditional Chinese shops offering variety of products at reasonable and attractive prices. Muar agriculture is mainly made up of the major crops of rubber and oil palm beside some coconut, cocoa, fruits (durian, rambutan, duku, mangosteen, banana, papaya, pineapple, dragon fruit etc.), vegetables and livestock, poultry and fish farming. Fishing is the major economy of some fishing villages like Parit Jawa, Parit Raja, Parit Tiram, and Kesang. There are many cafes that are being open in Muar around the Bakri area to attract tourists and for local enjoyment.  Education  Muar High School (Sekolah Tinggi Muar)(È∫ªÂù°È´òÁ∫ß‰∏≠Â≠¶) began as a Government English School and it was first housed in an attap (the processed leaves of nypa fruticans) shed known as 'Balai Kuning' which was actually used by the Sultan of Johore as a reception hall whenever he visited Muar. It was located near the site of the former High Court Building. The school was founded in 1902. It was under the charge of one Mr. C.P. Frois, a Eurasian gentleman from Malacca. He was the first headmaster cum teacher of the school and the enrolment of the school then was about 40 pupils. It was not until 1904, the majestic British colonial style historical school building started its construction and completed in 1915 and it is still standing. During the Second World War, the school was used as a Japanese concentration camp. Its alumni include national and state leaders, high-ranking government officials and industrialists, such as Tan Sri Osman Saat, Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin, Dato Seri Abdul Ghani Othman, His Excellency(Rtd) Dr Bahar Munip, and Tan Sri Hussin Hj Ismail. Chung Hwa High School is one of the oldest Chinese Independent high schools in Malaysia. It celebrated its 100th anniversary in July 2012. A fund raising event and dinner was held in conjunction with Chung Hwa High School's 100th anniversary and several million ringgit was raised for the school's fund.  EduHub Pagoh (Bandar Universiti Pagoh)  Pagoh Educational Hub (EduHub Pagoh), the largest public education hub area in Malaysia, is being constructed at Bandar Universiti Pagoh, a new well-planned education township in Muar.

It is reached by hotel launch from St Mark's Square, a five-minute journey across the lagoon. Long considered one of the leading luxury hotels of the world, its room rates begin at USD $1,400 per night. History The hotel was opened in 1958 by Giuseppe Cipriani, founder of Harry‚Äôs Bar in Venice and inventor of the Bellini cocktail. As well as Giuseppe Cipriani, the partners in the joint company were the three daughters of the 2nd Earl of Iveagh, who provided the financing. The three sisters‚ÄîViscountess Boyd of Merton, Lady Honor Svedar and Lady Brigid Guinness‚Äîeach had a suite designed for themselves and their families. Rooms were decorated with Venetian furnishings, including Murano glass chandeliers, Fortuny fabrics and Venetian artworks. The hotel achieved instant acclaim. In 1962, the Earl asked Giuseppe Cipriani to rebuild and manage the Hotel Belvedere on his property in Asolo; this was reopened as the Hotel Villa Cipriani. In 1968, some adjoining land was purchased and a 600-meter Olympic- sized swimming pool (the only pool in central Venice) was added among gardens. In 1976, the Hotel Cipriani was purchased for ¬£900,000 by Sea Containers, which established a leisure division named Orient-Express Hotels Ltd. The hotel subsequently expanded into the adjacent Palazzo Vendramin, a 15th- century palace facing the lagoon and St Mark's Square. A restaurant, Cip's Club, was built on a floating pontoon in the lagoon. In 1990, the adjacent Granaries of the Republic were opened as an event space. In 2014, the Hotel Cipriani was renamed the Belmond Hotel Cipriani as part of the rebranding of Orient-Express Hotels as Belmond. In April 2014, the hotel opened Oro restaurant, designed by Adam Tihany, which in December 2015 was awarded a Michelin star. George Clooney got married at the hotel.\\"LVMH agrees purchase of hotels group Belmond in $3.2bn deal\\". Evening Standard.

Origins We hear of one Lancelot Lefebvre as one of the masters of tapestry weaving in Brussels and in Antwerp in 1655; and in Italy, in 1630, we read of a certain Pierre le Fevre, a master tapestry worker, who was a native of Paris. It is not known whether these two men were connected one with the other, and of their personal history we know very little. Pierre died in 1669, leaving a son Philip, who was working in Florence in 1677. Pierre le Fevre In 1647, Pierre was attracted by some offers made him on the part of Henry IV of France, and left Florence for Paris. There he received considerable emoluments, was styled Tapissier to the King, and provided with a workshop in the Garden of the Tuileries. He is known to have gone back to Florence in 1650, but to have returned to Paris five years later; he probably lived in Florence for about ten years, returning there for the last short period of his life. His son Jean, who came with him, does not appear to have ever quit France, and he had the single honour, on the establishment of the Gobelin factory, of directing with Jean Jans the high warp looms. Jans was a Flemish weaver, but had come to Paris to work in the royal buildings in 1654, and he had charge of the largest workshop of the new factory, giving employment to sixty-seven weavers, exclusive of apprentices. Jean Lef√®vre The second workshop, which was erected in the Garden of the Tuileries, was the one conducted by Jean Lef√®vre, and he appears to have had full charge of it until 1770, and to have earned for the Government a very large sum of money. The fine tapestry titled \\"The Toilet of a Princess\\", which was in the Spitzer collection, was the work of Jean Lef√®vre, and three other pieces, representing Bacchanalia, bear his name on their selvedge. One of his major works was titled \\"The Toilet of Flora\\", a sheet of tapestry now preserved at the Garde-meuble. Cardinal Mazarin possessed one of his hangings titled \\"The History of St. Paul\\", and he was probably largely responsible for the two series titled \\"The History of Louis XIV\\", and \\"The History of Alexander\\".
