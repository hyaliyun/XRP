Porta San Giovanni is a gate in the Aurelian Wall of Rome, Italy, named after the nearby Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran. History It is made up of a single grand arch built for pope Gregory XIII in \\"opera forse\\" by Giacomo della Porta or, it is argued, Giacomo del Duca, who had collaborated with Michelangelo on the Porta Pia. The confusion is because the chronology of the era merely speaks of a famous architect called Giacomo. Popular tradition insists the architect was Della Porta, for he died in crowds at the gate, \\"which he had built\\" of violent indigestion brought on by melons and watermelons, returning from a trip to the Castelli Romani. Inaugurated in 1574, it had been necessitated by the reorganization of the whole Lateran area to facilitate traffic to and from southern Italy. Its opening led to the definitive closure of the neighboring and more imposing Porta Asinaria, of Aurelian date, which was by the 1570s proving unable to sustain such a high level of traffic and almost unusable due to the progressive raising of the road level neighboring. Its design is conceived as more like the entrance to a villa than as a defensive work, lacking side towers, ramparts, and battlements, and marked instead by pronounced rustication work and by a simple decorative scheme composed of a large bearded head atop the arch on the external side. The commemorative inscription above the arch reads: GREGORIVS XIII PONT. MAX PVBLICAE VTILITATI ET VRBIS ORNAMENTO VIAM CAMPANAM CONSTRAVIT PORTAM EXSTRVXIT ANNO MDLXXIIII PONT. III The road in fact gives access to the via Campana (now the Via Appia Nuova), which for its first 3 miles follows the route of the ancient Via Asinaria, then that of the Via Labicana. The name via Campana, it is presumed, derives both from the road's ultimate destination of Campania and from the Roman Campagna through which it runs. Besides the historical and military events on its reliefs, the Porta San Giovanni is linked to popular Roman traditions, now almost entirely disappeared, especially that relating to the \\"Notte di San Giovanni\\", on 23 June, the \\"notte delle streghe\\", with a major festival. According to legend, on that night the ghost of Herodias, who had convinced her husband Herod Antipas to decapitate John the Baptist, organizes a witches' sabbath on the Lateran meadows - to chase them away, the Romans organised a big party with rattles and fireworks. The \\"notti di S. Giovanni\\" were always characterised by the custom of eating slugs, whose horns symbolised discord (the meaning of the tradition is much more recent) - the eaten slugs, thus, bury in the stomach all arguments and resentments that had accumulated over the previous year, giving the custom the meaning of reconciliation. The modern Appio-Latino quarter, now outside the gate, was set up in 1926 by demolishing and building over houses, cottages, vineyards, inns, and meadows. To keep the gate viable, also in 1926 fornici were opened at its sides, which can still be seen today.  Sources San Giovanni Rome Q.

They have both been converted to residential use. They are named North Mill and South Mill. A third mill existed in Clavering until the mid-nineteenth century, known as Clavering Mill. History=Clavering Mill= Clavering Mill was a Post mill. It was marked on a map dated c.1625 and then in the ownership of Sir Francis Barrington. In 1702 it was conveyed to Sir Charles Barrington. The mill was marked on Warburton, Bland and Smyth‚Äôs map of 1724. It was marked on a plan of Clavering dated 1783 and also on the 1840 Tithe map of Clavering. White‚Äôs Directory of 1848 records three millers in Clavering, the last date at which the post mill can be assumed to have been standing. =North Mill= North Mill was built for James Pavitt in 1811, working in conjunction with the post mill until 1845. A oil engine was installed in 1919 by Thomas Hunt, the Soham millwright. The sails were removed about this time, but the mill worked by the engine for many years. =South Mill= South Mill was built in 1757. The mill was idle in 1906, but then put back to work by its new owner, William Caton. It worked by wind until autumn 1919 and the sails were removed the following spring. No auxiliary power was provided, the mill working by wind alone. Description=Clavering Mill= No details are known of this mill, although it would have had Common sails when built. It is not known whether there was a roundhouse or not. =North Mill= North Mill is a five-storey tower mill with a beehive cap, winded by a fantail. It had four Single Patent sails, which rotated clockwise. The Upright Shaft is wooden, as is the clasp arm Great Spur Wheel, which drove three pairs of millstones overdrift. =South mill= South Mill is a four-storey tower mill with a beehive cap with a gallery.

Libys could reach 60 centimeters in length and was therefore a medium-sized coelacanth, with a short and high skull.

Her work often focuses on various aspects of identity including gender, race, and sexuality. It often draws upon her own personal experience with cross cultural, non-heterosexual love. Early life and education Sarif was born in London, England, to Indian parents who had left South Africa in the early 1960s to escape apartheid. She studied English literature at the University of London, then took a Master's in English at Boston University. Career In January 2001, Sarif co-founded a multi-media entertainment company based in London and in partnership between her spouse, producer Hanan Kattan, called Enlightenment Productions in which all of her films would be released through. Her roots inspired her to write her debut novel, The World Unseen (2001), which explores issues of race, gender and sexuality, which she later adapted into a film starring Lisa Ray and Sheetal Sheth. It was heavily inspired by the stories of Sarif's grandmother and the family's Indian and South African heritage. She has also adapted and directed a film based on her book I Can't Think Straight.Rachael Scott, \\"Having a gay old time: Novelist turned film-maker Shamim Sarif has two films, both based on her books, coming out tomorrow.

In his playing career he had never experienced a loss, playing in winning sides in all but one of his games, the other was drawn. Hickey and Laver had made their VFL debuts in the same match in 1926.

It was built in 4 phases. Phases=Roman= Of the walls built during the ancient Roman era, the only traces to survive are those incorporated into the foundations of certain palazzi. The route of this wall corresponded to a meander of the river Medoacus (now the Brenta River) in which developed Padua's first urban centre. =13th century= The Mura Duecentesche (\\"13th century walls\\"; also known as the mura comunali or mura medievali) were built at the start of the 13th century by the Comune of Padua. Their route was delimited by the two branches of the Bacchiglione, the Tronco Maestro and the Naviglio Interno, which came to be used as defensive ditches. There are several remains of them around the Castello and near Porta Molino. More minor remains are to be found in the Riviera Tito Livio and Riviera Albertino Mussato; the only gates to remain from this wall are the main north gate, Porta Molino (or Molini, after several mills in the area which functioned up to the early 20th century), and the main west gate, Porta Altinate (named after the road to Altino which began here). The Porta Molino's upper stories were used at the end of the 19th century as a reservoir the town's first drinking water system, though tales of the tower being used as an observatory by Galileo Galilei during his time in the city are probably false. The Porta Altinate fronted onto the Naviglio Interno, crossed by an ancient Roman three-arch bridge (the Naviglio and the bridge were buried in the 1960s), and in 1256 this gate was stormed and destroyed by crusaders fighting against Ezzelino da Romano (as recorded in an inscription recorded by Carlo Leoni). It was rebuilt in 1286. Image:Alti-gar.jpgPorta Altinate seen from Piazza Garibaldi. Image:Altinate-2.jpgPorta Altinate seen from the Contrada Altinate. Image:Alti-statue.jpgSculptures inside Porta Altinate. =14th century= The Mura Carraresi (\\"Carraresi's Walls\\") were built by the Carraresi in the 14th century and followed a route which corresponds almost entirely to that of the later 16th century wall. Almost nothing remains of them, since they were demolished during the War of the League of Cambrai to create the Renaissance wall - some sections can be seen in via delle Dimesse, near the Prato della Valle. =16th century= The Mura Cinquecentesche (\\"16th-century Walls\\"; also known as the Mura rinascimentali or Veneziane) were built during the first decades of the 16th century by the Venetian Republic under the local leadership of the condottiero Bartolomeo d'Alviano. The west flank was protected by the canal still known as the fossa Bastioni. Most of the walls and nearly all the gates survive unbroken apart from sections demolished in the 1960s to build the new Ospedale Civile. The gates include: *Porta Savonarola - Completed in 1530. Designed by the architect Giovanni Maria Falconetto, this gate was built with a frieze showing the Lion of Saint Mark, symbol of the Venetian Republic, which still survives. *Porta san Giovanni - Completed in 1528. Designed by the architect Giovanni Maria Falconetto, this gate originally had a frieze showing the Lion of Saint Mark, symbol of the Venetian Republic (the frieze here was destroyed during the Napoleonic Wars). *Porta Ognissanti (or Portello, Portello Nuovo or Portello Venezia) - Originally entitled Portello or Little Port, the gate was built at the terminus for the river trade along the Brenta between Padua and Venice. The present building replaces the Portello Vecchio, on what is now via San Massimo, but is different from the city's other contemporaray gates - the external facade is adorned with white Istrian marble, with four pairs of columns surmounted by an architrave embellished with four trachyte cannonballs. The three-arch bridge carrying the road over the Canale Piovego and through the gate is guarded by two white stone lions. This conceals the gate's true tactical nature. Stones in the gate (still legible today) commemorate the ancient origins of the town, elogising its good governance. Since 1535 a clock stands out from the gate on a sort of \\"torrino\\" (vaguely like that on the Quirinal), in Nanto stone, atop the gate. Traces of frescoes can also be seen inside the gate. * Porta Liviana - Begun in 1509, it was completed in 1517 and named in honour of Bartolomeo d'Alviano himself. * Porta Santa Croce - On the site of a gate in the Carraresi wall, the present gate was begun in 1509 and was originally defended by a tower, demolished in 1632.

It lies on the Military Road (Northumberland) B6318. A motorist arriving over the B6138 from the east will see the place name shield \\"Once Brewed\\", while those coming from the west will read \\"Twice Brewed\\". Once Brewed lies just south of Hadrian's Wall, which runs along the top of the Whin Sill ridge above the village to the north. The Roman fort of Vindolanda is a couple of miles away to the south-east. The Roman earthwork known as the Vallum runs right past Once Brewed, adjoining and also overlain by the Military Road. Etymology The new youth hostel and Visitor Centre is called \\"The Sill\\". According to a sign in the Once Brewed Youth Hostel, there first was a Twice Brewed Inn, and the youth hostel was therefore called \\"Once Brewed\\". The \\"Once Brewed\\" closed in 2015/6 and was rebuilt as \\"The Sill\\". The Sill Visitor Centre and caf√© was officially opened by Prince Charles in 2018. Location The village consists of the Twice Brewed Inn, a combined YHA youth hostel and Visitor Centre to the Northumberland National Park ('The Sill'), and also some farms. One of the farms is a bit further away, and is called \\"West Twice Brewed\\" on the Ordnance Survey maps. Both the Twice Brewed Inn and the youth hostel are popular sleeping places for walkers on the Hadrian's Wall Path and the Pennine Way. The village of Iverton, which appears on 18th-century maps of Northumberlandhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/Comitatus_Northumbria_vernacule_Northumberland_- _CBT_6595991.jpg and latterly in two probate records from the 1830s, appears to have been coextensive with, or in very close proximity to, Twice Brewed.https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-roman- studies/article/hadrians-wall-a-history-of-the- problem/89958D4E375DC3675AB0389153CB3A37 R. G. Collingwood, writing in 1921, identifies Iverton with Everton, a \\"ruined farm half a mile west of Chesterholm\\", or roughly the distance between Chesterholm and Twice Brewed. No farm of that name appears on Ordnance Survey maps from the 1920s or earlier, however. It is possible that the name of the Twice Brewed Inn gradually became attached to the buildings around Everton as the latter fell into disrepair. The same maps place 'Forsten', another no longer extant Northumberland village, just across Bradley Burn from Once Brewed. Collingwood's identification of Forsten with Fourstones near Hexham thus appears to be mistaken. Twice Brewed Inn =Twice Brewed Inn= There are several stories which explain the name of the inn. The most romantic story has it that on the eve of the Battle of Hexham in 1464, Yorkist foot soldiers demanded their beer be brewed again because it lacked its usual fighting strength. The ploy worked as the Lancastrian army later fled after an early morning raid against the rejuvenated troops.Twice Brewed Inn, Bardon Mill, The Daily Telegraph, 14 April 2011, retrieved 27 November 2013 A more prosaic explanation is that 18th-century farmers tended to brew (and serve) weak ale, and hence \\"twice brewed\\" meant the inn offered stronger ale.Mark Richards, (2008), The Spirit of Hadrian's Wall, page 82. Cicerone Press. A third theory is that Hadrian's Wall snakes its way across the brows, or \\"brews\\", of two hills where there is also a meeting of a pair of drovers‚Äô roads. The antiquarian William Hutton walked the length of Hadrian's Wall in 1801 and stayed one night at the Twice Brewed inn. He describes how a pudding was cooked \\"as big as a peck measure\\" and \\"a piece of beef ... perhaps equal to half a calf.\\"William Hutton (1802) The History of the Roman Wall page 231 Although the inn was full, the landlady was able after some delay to find him a bed for the night.  Governance  Once Brewed is in the parliamentary constituency of Hexham, Guy Opperman of the Conservative Party is the Member of Parliament. Before Brexit, European Parliament its residents voted to elect MEP's for the North East England constituency.

History Station buildings in Caerleon awaiting platform rebuilding and station re-opening on the Welsh Marches Line The station was opened by the Pontypool, Caerleon and Newport Railway on 21 December 1874. This came after the absorption of the Pontypool company by the Great Western Railway. The station closed to passengers on 30 April 1962 and to all traffic on 29 November 1965. The site is now mixed use business premises including a gym, MOT centre and Veterinary Clinic.  Proposed reopening  The Newport City Council unitary development plan and Sewta rail strategy in 2006 set out plans for the station to be re-opened. Assessments by Capita Symonds in 2010 evaluated the cost of the project as ¬£14.1m, and highlighted it would be of particular importance given the popular restaurant and pub environment in the town, as well as the 70,000 yearly visitors to the Roman tourist attractions nearby. Caerleon is particularly suited to public transport improvements as it has long had poor air quality. It has been subject to a Newport City Council air quality management area study since January 2018 due to the low standard of air quality in the town centre. The Welsh Government has commissioned Arup to review the Caerleon Station Grip 3 Report land around the site has been safeguarded by Newport City Council for future reopening but in the near term the station has been neglected in favour of other reopenings predominantly in the Cardiff area. Nevertheless, Newport City Council has discussed preliminary matters such as the provision of approximately half a hectare for car parking, subject to exact provision being agreed with Welsh Government. The rail operator Transport for Wales announced in 2018 that Caerleon is a target for reopening as part of the South Wales Metro project. It would join similar proposed facilities at Magor, Cardiff Parkway, and Llanwern. Proposals to reopen Caerleon station were strengthened following the decision by First Minister Mark Drakeford in 2019 to reject the M4 relief road, which now allows up to ¬£1.4bn to be allocated through the Welsh Government's borrowing facility for improving infrastructure in and around the south east Wales M4. a  Services See also *Railway stations in Newport *South Wales Metro * Transport for Wales * Proposed railway stations in Wales References=NotesSources=  * External links *Station on a navigable 1947 O.S. map Disused railway stations in Newport, Wales Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1874 Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1962 Former Great Western Railway stations Caerleon 1874 establishments in Wales ","title":"Caerleon railway station"},{"id":"18539394","text":"is a train station in San'y≈ç-Onoda, Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan.

The action was in the nature of ejectment, brought in the Superior Court of the Los Angeles County by Dominga Dominguez against Brigido Botiller and others, to recover possession of a tract of land situated in said county, known as 'Rancho Las Virgenes'. The title of the plaintiff was a grant claimed to have been made by the government of Mexico to Nemecio Dominguez and Domingo Carrillo, on October 1, 1834, but no claim under this grant had ever been presented for confirmation to the board of land commissioners, appointed under the California Land Act of 1851 (9 St. 631,) 'to ascertain and settle the private land claims in the state of California,' and no patent had ever issued from the United States to any one for the land, or for any part of it.

The kip is an important skill that is used as both a mount and an element or connecting skill in a bar routine. The kip allows the gymnast to swing below the bar to arrive in a front support on the bar. From the front support, the gymnast may then perform any number of skills. The glide kip is the most commonly used mount on the women's uneven bars. The kip has been used since the early days of modern gymnastics. Currently, in the USA, the kip first appears in the women's USAG Level 4. Variations Youna Dufournet performing a Glide Kip on bars Variations of the kip include the long hang kip, glide kip,Goeller, Karen M. \\"Ahhh... The Glide Kip\\" Technique Magazine Nov./Dec. 2004 drop kip, kip with stoop through and kip with jump turn. *The glide kip may be used as a mount or a connecting skill. The glide kip is performed by swinging in a piked hollow position, toes in front, under the bar to extend to a straight hollow position parallel to the floor. Once extended, the gymnast quickly pulls his or her feet towards the bar while simultaneously pushing down with straight arms to arrive in a straight hollow front support on the bar. Taller gymnasts may perform the glide kip in a straddle hollow rather than piked hollow swing, joining the feet together at extension, before initiating the kipping action. *The long hang kip utilizes the gymnast's ability to swing on the high bar to perform a kip. Unlike a glide kip, the long hang kip does not swing in a piked hollow position nor does it swing all the way out to horizontal. A long hang kip begins with a straight hollow swing under the bar and performs the kipping action (the pulling of the feet to the bar while pushing with the arms) much earlier in the swing than does a glide kip. *The drop kip is a kip often used in gymnastics conditioning, both to strengthen the muscles of those who already are able to perform a kip as well as to help new students learn a kip. This kip utilizes little swing, rather, it requires a great deal of strength on the part of the gymnast. The gymnast begins in a front support on the bar, thighs on the bar, chest in hollow. He or she then drops backwards with straight arms, \\"sliding\\" the bar down his or her legs to his or her feet. His or her shins or feet must stay close to the bar. After completing his or her small swing backwards he or she begins the kipping action by pushing down with straight arms to arrive again in a hollow front support on the bar. *The glide kip with stoop through is performed by executing a glide kip, but bringing the feet and straight legs between the bar and the arms to finish sitting on top of the bar. The gymnast typically will then use the propulsion of the kip to push off the low bar and catch the high bar. This skill may also be performed by straddling the legs over the bar rather than piking between the hands. *The jump with 1/2 turn to kip and jump with 1/1 turn to kip is a kip performed with a jump half or jump full turn prior to catching the bar. When a jump half turn is performed, the gymnast does not swing but immediately kips from the air. When a jump full turn is performed, the gymnast completes the swing as usual before kipping. This skill may be performed on the low or the high bar.

Secretive research into the history and nature of rituals, rites, initiation, sacred sexuality and Magick is then translated into the public, more popular languages of performance, art, music, dance or installation. Following the Ac√©phale model, there is a complete rejection of any form of social and political hierarchy and the group opposes any authoritarian form of leadership in terms of both their structure and their production. The operative members change even though the core has remained fixed since its inception in 2003. The group rejects the divisions that exist today between the different art forms and instead insist on working simultaneously in the worlds of dance, music and the visual arts. Frequently the collective presents their Performances or actions alongside their official more famous productions. For instance \\"PostPunkPaganPop\\" was the title of a solo exhibition by Kendell Geers at the Depuryluxemburg Gallery in Zurich in June 2008. At the opening he presented a performance with the same name as \\"thefucKINFUCKS\\" de Pury & Luxembourg It was also the title for a performance by thefucKINGFUCKS presented at the Cimatics V.J.

PostPunkPaganPop The term PostPunkPaganPop has been used by Geers to describe both his own work and that of thefucKINGFUCKS. Post-punk defines an attitude as a musical genre, whereas pagan defines the groups interest in rites, rituals and the question of faith. The public face of the group maintains the Pop centred style of music that Codenys became famous for in the 1980s.

Body Sound Image The performances are an audio-visual-sensory-experience. In the 1980s Patrick Codenys used the terms Electronic body music to describe the music of Front 242. A generation later Kendell Geers defines his art as a \\"Panaesthetik\\",On the Encoded Strategies of Revolution, by Ines Gebetsroither, Spike, pp.62-70, Vienna a term that attempts to describe an all-encompassing notion of aesthetics. Together with Ilse Ghekiere, their performances are sensory overload in which the senses of hearing, seeing, smalling, even touching are all pushed to their limits. The razorblade installations of Geers are the backdrop to the grinding electronic body music rhythms and beats of Codenys and the erotic female body in trance of Ghekiere is the key to unlocking the mystery. As a reflection of their interest in the dark arts, the sounds tend to hang in the extreme low sub base area and heard in the pit of your stomach more than the ears.[Pop-Rock.com, le site de la pop et du rock des ann√©es 80 √† nos jours] Multiple Identities Since 2004 thefucKINFUCKS have performed under the names \\"Red Sniper, Head Sniper, Firewire, Akephale, Kissing Kousins, USB2, PostPunkPaganPop, S338 and Suite 338.

It is the administrative centre of the borough. In the fifteenth century the town became an economic hub of the old West Riding of Yorkshire, primarily in woollen manufacture. From New Year's Day 1779 manufacturers and mercers dealt internationally in such articles through its grandiose square, the Piece Hall. Halifax is known for Mackintosh's chocolate and toffee products including Rolo and Quality Street. The Halifax Bank was founded and has large offices in the town. Dean Clough, one of the largest textile factories in the world at more than long, is today a converted building for hotel, office and retail use including a gym, theatre, Travelodge and radio station, north of the town centre. Toponymy George Montagu-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax The town's name was recorded in about 1091 as Halyfax, from the Old English halh-gefeaxe, meaning \\"area of coarse grass in the nook of land\\". This explanation is preferred to derivations from the Old English halig (holy), in hƒÅlig feax or \\"holy hair\\", proposed by 16th-century antiquarians. The incorrect interpretation gave rise to two legends. One concerned a maiden killed by a lustful priest whose advances she spurned. Another held that the head of John the Baptist was buried here after his execution. The legend is almost certainly medieval rather than ancient, although the town's coat of arms carries an image of the saint. Another explanation is a corruption of the Old English hay and ley a clearing or meadow. This etymology is based on Haley Hill, the nearby hamlet of Healey (another corruption), and the common occurrence of the surnames Hayley/Haley around Halifax. The erroneous derivation from halig has given rise to the demonym Haligonian, which is of recent origin and not in universal use. The Earldom of Halifax took the name of the town. Its first creation, in the Peerage of England in 1677, was for George Savile, who was created Baron Savile of Eland and Viscount Halifax in 1668 and later became the Marquess of Halifax (this creation of the earldom became extinct in 1700). George Montagu-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax, (2nd order of the 3rd creation) became the President of the Board of Trade in 1748. In 1749 the city of Halifax, the capital of Nova Scotia, Canada, was named in his honour. The Halifax River in Central Florida, United States, was also named after him. History Halifax in 1834 Halifax is not mentioned in the Domesday Book, and evidence of the early settlement is indefinite. By the 12th century the township had become the religious centre of the vast parish of Halifax, which extended from Brighouse in the east to Heptonstall in the west. Halifax Minster, parts of which date from the 12th century is dedicated to St John the Baptist. The minster's first organist, in 1766, was William Herschel, who discovered the planet Uranus. The coat of arms of Halifax include the chequers from the original coat of arms of the Earls Warenne, who held the town during Norman times. Halifax was notorious for its gibbet, an early form of guillotine used to execute criminals by decapitation, that was last used in 1650. A replica has been erected on the original site in Gibbet Street. Its original blade is on display at Bankfield Museum. Punishment in Halifax was notoriously harsh, as remembered in the Beggar's Litany by John Taylor (1580‚Äì1654), a prayer whose text included \\"From Hull, from Halifax, from Hell, ‚Äòtis thus, From all these three, Good Lord deliver us.\\".The association of the three names pre-dates Taylor as the poet Thomas Nashe refers to them: \\"...neither in Hull, Hell, nor Halifax.\\" ‚Äì Nashes Lenten Stuffe, London, 1599. The town's 19th century wealth came from the cotton, wool and carpet industries and like most other Yorkshire towns, it had a large number of weaving mills many of which have been lost or converted to alternate use. In November 1938, in an incident of mass hysteria, many residents believed a serial killer, the Halifax Slasher, was on the loose. Scotland Yard concluded there were no attacks after several locals admitted they had inflicted wounds on themselves. Halifax plc started as a building society, the Halifax Permanent Benefit Building and Investment Society, in the town in 1853. Today the bank operates as a trading name of HBOS, part of the Lloyds Banking Group. Yorkshire Bank, based in Leeds and known as the West Riding Penny Savings Bank, was established on 1 May 1859 by Colonel Edward Akroyd of Halifax. Halifax is twinned with Aachen in Germany. The A58 has a stretch called Aachen Way. Halifax has benefited from Single Regeneration Budget, European URBAN II and the Home Office‚Äôs Community Cohesion Fund money through Action Halifax who have a vision for \\"a prosperous, vibrant and safe centre where all sections of the community can access opportunities to enhance their quality of life.\\" Governance Halifax Town Hall The ancient parish of Halifax was divided into a large number of civil parishes in the 19th century. In Halifax, a body of improvement commissioners or town trustees was created between 1762 and 1823, and the town became a borough constituency under the Great Reform Act of 1832. Halifax was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1848 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, and, with the passing of the Local Government Act 1888, became a county borough in 1889. Since 1974, Halifax has been the administrative centre of the Metropolitan Borough of Calderdale in West Yorkshire. Geography St Paul's Church Topographically, Halifax is located in the south-eastern corner of the moorland region called the South Pennines. Halifax is situated about from the M62 motorway, close to Bradford and Huddersfield. The Tees-Exe line passes through the A641 road, which links Brighouse with Bradford and Huddersfield, The town lies from Hull and Liverpool, and about from the cities of London, Edinburgh, Belfast, Dublin and Cardiff as the crow flies. The Hebble Brook joins the River Calder at Salterhebble. Demography In 2004 Calderdale had a population of 192,405, of which 82,500 live in the Halifax urban area. The main ethnic group in Halifax is White (87%), followed by British Pakistani (10%). Over 90% of people aged 16‚Äì74 were employed, mostly full-time. 64% of residents had qualifications. Halifax is home to a large South Asian community mainly of British Pakistanis from the Kashmir region, which originally moved to the area for employment in the textile industry. The majority of the community lives in the west central Halifax region of the town, which was previously home to immigrant Irish communities who have since moved to the outer suburbs. The Illingworth and Mixenden areas, in contrast to west central Halifax, consists mostly of white, Protestant residents. In the 2001 census, 5% stated they were Muslim, 16.3% of no religion, and 63.8% of Christian background. 12.8% did not disclose their religion. The population density of the Halifax urban area is 530/km2. Economy Joseph Crossley's Almshouses Halifax Bank headquarters on Trinity Road As well as the significance of the bank Halifax plc which, since 2008, is part of the Lloyds Banking Group, the town has strong associations with confectionery. John Mackintosh and his wife, Violet, opened a toffee shop in King Cross Lane in 1890. Violet formulated the toffee's recipe. John became known as \\"The Toffee King\\". A factory was opened on Queens Road in 1898. A new factory at Albion Mill, at the current site near the railway station, opened in 1909. John died in 1920, and his son Harold not only continued the business but took it to the present size and range of confectionery it has today. Their famous brands, including Rolo, Toffee Crisp and Quality Street of chocolate and confectionery are not just popular in the UK, but around the world including the USA. In 1969 John Mackintosh & Co Limited merged with the York-based Rowntree Limited to form Rowntree Mackintosh. This was, in turn, purchased by Nestl√© in 1988. Halifax was a busy industrial town, dealing in and producing wool, carpets, machine tools and beer. The Crossley family began carpet manufacture in modest premises at Dean Clough, on the banks of Hebble Brook. The family was philanthropic and Joseph and Sir Francis Crossley built and endowed almshouses for their workers, which exist to this day and are run by volunteer trustees. Halifax is also home to Suma Wholefoods, which was established in 1975 and is the largest workers' co- operative in the UK. Transport A map of Halifax from 1954 Public bus and train transportation in Halifax is managed and subsidised by West Yorkshire Metro. It was announced in January 2009 that Halifax was to have a direct rail link to London after a long campaign backed by many, including the local paper the Courier; the service began to run on 23 May 2010. =Bus= Most of the bus services in Halifax operate from the town's bus station. First Calderdale & Huddersfield operate most of the town's services, while Yorkshire Tiger operate many of the south Calderdale services. Arriva Yorkshire operate services that link Halifax with the West Yorkshire towns and cities of Dewsbury and Wakefield. First operate bus services from Halifax to the town of Huddersfield and the nearby cities of Bradford and Leeds. First also run services into other counties, Rochdale in Greater Manchester and Burnley in Lancashire. Other bus operators in the town include T.J. Walsh (also known as the Halifax Bus Company) and Halifax Joint Committee which use the livery of the old Halifax Corporation buses, used on the town's buses until 1974. =Rail= Halifax railway station is on the Caldervale Line, with services to Manchester Victoria, York, Selby via Bradford and Leeds; Blackpool North; via Brighouse to Huddersfield and Wakefield Westgate and to London King's Cross via Wakefield Kirkgate. The London service is operated by Grand Central, the others by Northern Trains. Rail passenger representation is organised by the local users' group, the Halifax and District Rail Action Group (HADRAG). The rail line leading from Halifax due north towards Keighley (and thus towards Skipton, Morecambe and Carlisle) with a further branch to Bradford via Queensbury saw its last through services in May 1955, although parts of the route, which was extremely heavily engineered with long tunnels and high, spectacular viaducts, have now been repaired and revived by Sustrans as a walking and cycle route. In 2018 a campaign was launched to save and restore the Queensbury Tunnel and add it to the walking and cycling network. A branch from Holmfield, on the Halifax to Queensbury section of the lines to Keighley and Bradford, served the west side of Halifax. It terminated at St Pauls station. This short branch closed to passengers in January 1927 and to all traffic in June 1960. Halifax is also served by Sowerby Bridge railway station on the southwest edge of the town, just to the south of the River Calder. Media Calderdale's BBC local radio station is BBC Radio Leeds. Calderdale's local radio station, Phoenix Radio 96.7 FM has its studios in Halifax, and the Courier, Calderdale's local weekly newspaper, has its offices in the town. Education The Halifax area is home to two selective state schools, which are the Crossley Heath School in Savile Park and North Halifax Grammar School in Illingworth. Both schools achieve excellent GCSE and A-level results with both schools achieving a large proportion of A*to C grades at GCSE level. In 2005, the Crossley Heath School was the highest ranking co- educational school in the North of England. Calderdale College is a further education college located on Francis Street, just off King Cross Road, in the west of the town. The Maltings College opened in 2013 and offers a range of vocational sixth form courses. In December 2006 it was announced that Calderdale College, in partnership with Leeds Beckett University, opened a new higher education institution in January 2007 called 'University Centre Calderdale'. Culture Laying up of 1981 stand of Regimental Colours of the 1st Battalion Duke of Wellington's Regiment in Halifax Minster Eureka! The National Children's Museum Victoria Theatre, Halifax The Playhouse, Halifax The Duke of Wellington's Regiment (West Riding) Regimental Association, previously based at Wellesley Park, on the junction of Gibbet Street and Spring Hall Road, in the former Wellesley Barracks is located within the Bankfield Museum on Boothtown Road. The former barracks was converted into an educational school in 2005. Former regimental colours of the 'Duke's' are laid up in the Halifax Minster. These include the stand used by the 33rd Regiment between 1761 and 1771, which is one of the oldest in existence in England, plus those carried by the regiment during the Battle of Waterloo and the Crimea.The Duke of Wellington's Regiment (West Riding) ‚Äì A Short History, by Major Savoury MBE & Major General DE Isles, CB OBE DL The 1981 stand of colours, was taken out of service in 2002. They were marched through the town from the town hall to the minster, which at that time was still a parish church, accompanied by two escorts of 40 troops, the Regimental Drums and the Heavy Cavalry and Cambrai Band on Sunday 31 March 2007. The troops were then inspected by the Lord Lieutenant of West Yorkshire, Dr Ingrid Roscoe BA, PhD, FSA and the Mayor of Halifax Cllr Colin Stout making a total of eight stands of colours within the Regimental Chapel. The regiment was presented with the \\"Freedom of Halifax\\" on 18 June 1945. Eureka! The National Children's Museum was inspired and opened by Prince Charles in the summer of 1992 and is in part of the railway station. Once the home of the diarist Anne Lister, Shibden Hall is just outside Halifax in the neighbouring Shibden Valley. Dean Clough, a refurbished worsted spinning mill, is the home of Northern Broadsides Theatre Company and the IOU theatre company as well as providing space for eight art galleries. The Artworks is a collection of artists studios, gallery space and an art school housed in an old mill complex just to the south of the town centre. A recent survey showed Halifax to have above average levels of drink- related violence and associated issues. In 2003 a major \\"Win Back the Streets Campaign\\" was launched to tackle the local ‚Äúbooze culture and stop yob violence in its tracks‚Äù. It had been revealed that violent crime in the town centre had risen by 440 per cent, in only four years.http://www.ias.org.uk/What-we-do/Alcohol-Alert/Issue-3-2003/Hell-and- Halifax.aspx Landmarks Piece Hall *Piece Hall is the former cloth hall, where pieces of woollen cloth were traded. Opened on 1 January 1779, trading took place for two hours on a Saturday morning in a total of 315 merchant trading rooms. After the mechanisation of the cloth industry, the Piece Hall became a public market. Piece Hall is host to many arts, crafts and independent shops. The Piece Hall has recently undergone a ¬£19 million conservation and transformation programme. The works were completed in July 2017, after a three year construction plan which overran by a year and over budget, with the building fully reopened in the August (on Yorkshire day) with shops, cafes and events run by the Piece Hall Charity which runs at a ¬£1 million loss each year. *Dean Clough Mill located beside the Victorian Gothic Revival North Bridge was built in the 1840s‚Äì'60s for Crossley's Carpets, owned by John Crossley and was once the largest carpet factory in the world. It was converted to a business park in the 1980s, by the late Sir Ernest Hall. *Halifax Town Hall was designed by Charles Barry, who also designed the Houses of Parliament, in 1863. *Borough Market is a Victorian covered market-place in the town centre. *Wainhouse Tower, at King Cross, is a late Victorian folly constructed between 1871 and 1875. Originally intended to be the chimney for a dye works, it became a folly after the dye works was sold in 1874 and the new owner refused to pay for its completion. It is the tallest folly in the world and the tallest structure in Calderdale. *People's Park is a public park originally designed by Joseph Paxton, given to the people of Halifax in 1857 by Sir Francis Crossley. *The Prescott Street drill hall designed by Richard Coad and completed in 1870. Sport The Shay, the town's football and rugby league stadium. The town has relatively successful sports clubs. Its rugby league club, Halifax RLFC, plays in the Betfred Championship. The town's football team, F.C. Halifax Town participates in the National League, the fifth tier of English football. =Football= The Shay football ground has been the home of the town's football club since 1921. The ground was substantially redeveloped in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, with money provided by the Football Foundation and funds raised or provided by the local community and Calderdale Council. =Rugby league= Halifax is home to the professional rugby league academy, Halifax Elite Rugby Academy, which has a partnership with Huddersfield and Castleford. Halifax RLFC is one of the most historic rugby league clubs in the game, formed over a century ago, in 1873. Amateur clubs Boothtown Terriers, Greetland All Rounders, Illingworth, King Cross Park, Ovenden, Siddal and Stainland Stags are based in or near the town. The Siddal club is a leading member of amateur rugby league's flagship National Conference League. Greetland All Rounders and Ovenden are former members. =Rugby union= Halifax has several senior rugby union clubs. They include Halifax, Halifax Vandals (Warley), Heath (West Vale), Old Crossleyans, Old Rishworthians (Copley) and Old Brodleians (Hipperholme). =Speedway= Motorcycle speedway racing has been staged at two venues in Halifax. In the pioneering days of 1928‚Äì1930 a track operated at Thrum Hall. A Halifax team took part in the English Dirt Track League of 1929. Speedway returned to Halifax at the Shay Stadium in 1949 and operated until 1951. The team operated as the Halifax Nomads in 1948 racing three away fixtures. The Halifax Dukes, the name they took once the Shay was opened, operated in the National League Third Division in 1949 before moving up to the Second Division in 1950. Riders including Arthur Forrest, moved on to Bradford. The Dukes re-emerged in 1965 as founder members of the British League and operated there for many years before the team moved en bloc to Odsal Stadium, Bradford. The steeply banked bends of the track at the Shay have been buried under stands at either end when the spectator facilities were squared off. =Swimming= Halifax Swimming Pool was opened in 1966 and designed by the borough architects FH Hoyles and JL Berbiers. It contains two ceramic murals by Kenneth Barden on the theme of British pond life. By 2020 there was consideration that a new swimming pool should be installed within the existing North Bridge Leisure Centre, and that the current building should be listed as a significant twentieth century building. Religious buildings All Souls' Church (now redundant) and statue of Edward Akroyd The Assembly Rooms and Trinity Church in Halifax from A Complete History of the County of York by Thomas Allen (1828‚Äì30) The 15th-century Minster dedicated to St. John the Baptist did not achieve cathedral status when a new diocese was being considered for the West Riding (Wakefield Parish Church became the cathedral in 1888 and was extensively altered and enlarged). Minster Status was conferred on the Parish Church in a ceremony on 22 November 2009. There is a collection of rare Commonwealth white glass as well as a series of Victorian windows. Another feature is the complete array of Jacobean box pews. The pair of Gothic organ cases by John Oldrid Scott now house the four-manual instrument by Harrison & Harrison. The belfry holds fourteen bells and an Angelus. St Mary's Roman Catholic Church on the corner of Gibbet Street and Clarence Street, was built in 1839, rebuilt in 1864 and extended in 1924. The Serbian Orthodox Church dedicated to St John the Baptist, in the Boothtown area, formerly the Mount Carmel Methodist Chapel, was acquired in 1956 and after extensive refurbishment was opened in the 1965 by the town's Serbian community. In 2015 the church celebrated its Golden Jubilee. The currently redundant mid- Victorian All Souls' Church by Sir George Gilbert Scott standing part way up Haley Hill to the north of the main town centre is now vested in the Historic Churches Preservation Trust. Its lofty spire and white magnesian limestone exterior stand as a very personal statement in 13th-century French style of the mill owner Colonel Edward Akroyd, who paid solely for its construction as the centre-piece of a purpose-built model village (\\"Akroydon\\"). All Souls' boasts an unusually complete sequence of windows by the leading artists of the 1850s, including William Wailes, John Hardman and Clayton & Bell. The large organ by Forster & Andrews inserted in 1868, ten years after the building was completed, is currently unplayable and many of its surviving parts are in storage awaiting restoration. The tower houses a ring of eight bells. Other churches which once included the Georgian Holy Trinity Church (which has since now been converted to office use) and the late impressive neo-Gothic (1911) St. Paul's, King Cross, by Sir Charles Nicholson. St Paul's is notable not only for its fine acoustics but also for an unusual and highly colourful west window, specified by Nicholson, showing the apocalyptic vision of the Holy City descending upon the smoky mills and railway viaducts of Halifax as it was before the First World War. The Church of St Jude in Savile Park, designed by local architect William Swinden Barber in 1888, is easily identified by the four large pinnacles on its tower. There is also a more modern Christadelphian church, located on Balmoral Place.Halifax Christadelphians , accessed 25 January 2018 The spire of the Square Church, not far from the minster at the bottom of the town, paid for by the carpet manufacturing Crossley family, is all that remains of the Gothic Congregational church built by Joseph James in 1856‚Äì58 as a rival design to All Souls', Haley Hill. The building was closed in 1969 and arsonists caused severe damage to the building two years later leading to its partial demolition. The rather comic story of the rival spires runs that the two buildings' towers were nearing completion simultaneously; the architects were ordered to stop work within a few feet of the top of the spires to see who would finish first. After some time, the Crossleys lost patience and finished their spire at , prompting the immediate completion of the rival building one foot higher. The remaining structure now forms the core of the new central library. The neighbouring and earlier (Georgian) Square Chapel (1772) survived a hundred years of use as a church hall and Sunday school for the larger church: it is currently an arts centre.

The team is composed mostly of professional footballers, who are often recent graduates from the highest youth level (Ajax A1) serving their first professional contract as a reserve, or players who are otherwise unable to play in the first team. Since 1992 Jong Ajax have competed in the Beloften Eredivisie, competing against other reserve teams such as Jong PSV, Jong FC Groningen or Jong AZ. They have won the Beloften Eredivisie title a record eight times, as well as the KNVB Reserve Cup three times, making them the most successful reserve squad in the Netherlands. By winning the Beloften Eredivisie title, Jong Ajax were able to qualify for the actual KNVB Cup, even advancing to the semi-finals on three occasions. Their best result in the Dutch Cup was under manager Jan Olde Riekerink in 2001‚Äì02, when a semi-final loss to FC Utrecht in a Penalty shoot-out after extra time, which saw Utrecht advance, and thus preventing an Ajax vs. Jong Ajax Dutch Cup final. The 2013‚Äì14 season marked the Jupiler League debut of the AFC Ajax reserves' squad Jong Ajax. Previously playing in the Beloften Eredivisie (a separate league for reserve teams, not included in the Dutch professional or amateur league structure) players were allowed to move around freely between the reserve team and the first team during the course of the season. This is no longer the case as Jong Ajax now registers and fields a separate squad from that of Ajax first team for the Eerste Divisie, the second tier of professional football in the Netherlands. Their home matches are played at Sportpark De Toekomst, except for the occasional match in the Amsterdam Arena. Now regarded a semi- professional team in their own respect, the only period in which players are able to move between squads is during the transfer windows, unless the player has made less than 15 appearances for the first team, then he is still eligible to appear in both first team and second team matches during the course of the season. Furthermore, the team is not eligible for promotion to the Eredivisie or to participate in the KNVB Cup. Jong Ajax were joined in the Eerste Divisie by Jong FC Twente and Jong PSV, reserve teams who have also moved from the Beloften Eredivisie to the Eerste Divisie, in place of VV Katwijk, SC Veendam and AGOVV Apeldoorn, increasing the total number of teams in the Jupiler League from 16 to 20. Jong Ajax left the Beloften Eredivisie in 2013, having held a 21-year tenure in the reserves league, having also won the league title a record eight times (1994, 1996, 1998, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2009).

Early life and education Jonathan Oxer was born at St Mary Abbott's Hospital in London, England to Australian parents who were working in London at the time. In late 1970 his parents returned to Melbourne, Australia. Oxer's primary education was at Blackwood Community School, a small alternative school created in the mid-1970s by a group of parents. The school was known for having an unstructured learning program that mixed students across all year levels and did not use scheduled class times. Oxer's secondary education was at St Michael's Grammar School where he completed his Higher School Certificate (HSC) in 1989. In 1987 Oxer was one of a group of students from the school who conducted an extra-curricular project to use information published by researchers at IBM Zurich, the University of Alabama, and the University of Houston to create a sample of yttrium-barium-copper-oxide (YBCO) superconductor capable of exhibiting superconducting properties at the temperature of liquid nitrogen, which at the time was the highest-temperature superconductor yet created Oxer's contributions to the project included writing software to plot the optimum cooling curve of the material to maximise crystal alignment during the annealing process. Career In 1994 Oxer founded Mission Internet, one of the first companies in the world to specialise in connecting database content to the Internet. In 2000 Mission Internet's operations became part of Internet Vision Technologies, a company formed in partnership with Andrew Minett.

He was also nominated for the 2008 election but did not accept the nomination. Early in his first term Oxer was the focus of controversy surrounding the application for a trademark in Australia for the term \\"Linux\\". In many countries the trademark \\"Linux\\" is registered by or on behalf of the Linux Mark Institute, an organisation which administers the trademark on behalf of Linus Torvalds. Following an attempt by an unassociated commercial entity known as Linux Australia Pty Ltd to register the trademark within Australia, Linux Australia agreed to act as an agent of Linux Mark Institute to contest the pending trademark application by Linux Australia Pty Ltd and submit a counterclaim for the trademark. Subsequent action taken by Linux Australia included presentation of a request for support for the trademark application to a number of FOSS-related businesses in Australia by a lawyer acting on behalf of the organisation. As a result of the way the letter was worded some recipients misinterpreted it as a demand for payment for use of the trademark, causing a negative backlash within the FOSS community. Jon Hall, President of Linux Mark Institute, subsequently defended the actions of Linux Australia Inc and confirmed that the application was submitted on behalf of the organisation. The trademark applications by both Linux Australia Pty Ltd and Linux Australia Inc were ultimately denied. During his incumbency Oxer was a vocal opponent of changes to Australian intellectual property law mandated by the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement, and in particular the broader definition of technological protection measures. In January 2020 he was awarded the Rusty Wrench Award for his services to the free software community in Australia. Cryptography Oxer has coordinated the large PGP/GPG keysigning parties at every Linux.conf.au from 2004 onward, and to assist with key collection and management for large groups created the keysigning.org website. He also administers keys.keysigning.org, the only keyserver in the subkeys.pgp.net network geographically located in Australasia. RFID Implant In March 2006 Oxer used a veterinary RFID tag implantation tool to implant an RFID tag under the skin of his left arm, and subsequently modified his house to allow the implanted tag to control items such as the door locks.

The sea warriors were instrumental in spreading Bau's political power throughout the South Pacific archipelagic islands. The rise of the eminent islet of Bau amongst other embryonic states was due mainly to the projection of sea power through its naval forces. Bauan chief Ratu Loaloadravu Tubuanakoro was praised by French Captain Dumont D'Urville in May 1827 for his geographic knowledge of the Fijian archipelago signifying Bau's naval influence.Sahlins, Marshall David. Apologies to Thucydides: Understanding History as Culture. University of Chicago Press, 2004, p. 53.Shino Konishi et al, \\"Indigenous Intermediaries: New perspectives on exploration archives\\" ANU Press, 2015, p.115. More far-ranging than Bau's land warriors led by the Vusaradave clan, the Lasakau clan became the leading proponents of war and tribute for the emerging island kingdom.Sahlins, 2004, p. 64. They became known as the Bai kei Bau or 'War fence of Bau'.Fiji historian Deryck Scarr concurred, stating, ‚ÄúBau relied on levying‚Ä¶ and power projected at sea by the Lasakau and Soso sailors‚Äù Sahlins made the crucial observation that,\\" The kings of Bau based their rule not on native cultivators but on native sailors and fishers-which is to say in Fijian categories, as in political strategies, not on the land but on the sea\\".Sahlins: 2004:65 This was the great political transformation that catapulted Bau to power over other pre-colonial kingdoms.

Walter Lawry, published by Charles Gilpin, 1850. -Rev. Walter Lawry, a > missionary, 1847. The Lasakau clan was traditionally the fishermen of Bau. The clan was also renowned as seafarers. This is verified by many traditional blood links to far-flung islands of Fiji. The leading families of Lasakau as purveyors of sea bounty and wealth married into Bauan royalty. They became key allies in the competing chiefly intrigues that shaped Fiji‚Äôs pre-colonial political landscape. As Bauan maritime supremacy came into contact with Western explorers, traders and missionaries, its native hegemonic power was transformed. Christian missionaries and British colonisers consolidated Bauan political influence as the conduit of Western civilization in the Fiji Islands. Bau history and ethnology The importance of Bauan history to pre- colonial Fiji has often been emphasised by scholars. In tracing its ascendency, Scarr succinctly posits, \\"The rise of Bau was rapid, and was due partly to the natural ability of her chiefs, and partly to the advantages gained from the first use of firearms. The Bau chiefs claimed descent from certain elements of the Fijian mythical Nakauvadra mountain range migration. Whom, having come to Verata, divided and wandered widely; in the final stage of their wanderings they settled, in comparatively recent times, on the coast near their present island, then named Ulu-ni-vuaka (The Pig's Head).\\"The Kubuna people on Bau (Ulu-ni-vuaka) island became embroiled in a struggle for power involving their chiefs that subsequently involved other tribal kingdoms of Fiji. The relationship between the Roko Tui Bau as sacred King and the Vunivalu of Bau as his warlord hence underwent a role inversion in the early nineteenth century. Lasakau Village, Bau Island late 1800s with Viwa Island in background. Originally Bau island was occupied by the Butoni, a predatory tribe of sailors and traders. About 1760, the Bau chief Nailatikau seized Ulu- ni-vuaka and expelled the Butoni, who thenceforth were rovers, wandering to many parts of the Group establishing settlements at Lakeba and Somosomo.Sahlins, Marshall David. Apologies to Thucydides: Understanding History as Culture. University of Chicago Press, 2004. p. 64. The Butoni however, continued to owe a degree of allegiance to their conquerors, and their canoes were always at the disposal of the chiefs of Bau for the transport of property and warriors. The Vunivalu of Bau, Nailatikau was succeeded by Banuve, who, during a period of nearly thirty years, consolidated the young state's position and carried out an ambitious scheme of improvements to the island. He reclaimed wide areas of the adjacent reef flats, and built stone canoe-docks and sea-walls as a protection against erosion. To provide manual labour, he allowed fishermen from Beqa and craftsmen from Kadavu to settle on the island in the areas known as Lasakau and Soso. The Lasakau people of the Yavusa Nabou clan trace their roots to Delailasakau Naitasiri and the Nakauvadra ranges foothills where their original ancestral home or yavutu was located. The clan re-located to Bau from Beqa Island on the invitation of the Vunivalu Ratu Banuve. This was after the banishment of the Levuka and Butoni people from Bau around the 1760s. A branch of the Lasakau clan from Beqa headed South to Yale, Kadavu Island. In addition an earlier migration of the Lasakau clan had also journeyed from Nakauvadra to Wainibuka with the Rokotuibau and on to Kubuna at Tai ko Bau with the Butoni and Levuka clans. The seafaring exploits of Bau's sea warriors, recounted through the lineage of the Lasakau Nabou sub-clan of Mataqalikira and in particular the two chiefly households of Nacokula and Nadrakuta reflected the Machiavellian and martial mores of the times. Through the chiefs of these two households, Bau's fortunes were intrepidly pursued by the Vunivalu Tui Kaba. Ratu Pope Seniloli the Vunivalu of Bau (1883‚Äì1936), in his sworn statement at the Native Lands Commission in 1933 for the Village of Lasakau asserted, Ai tokatoka ka liu ko Nacokula. Sa bula eso na kena kawa. (The leading family is of the household Nacokula. The descendants are alive).Oi rau vata ko Nacokula kei Nadrukuta (Nacokula and Nadrukuta are of the same household). A vale ruarua koya e rau i liuliu ni kai Lasakau kece edaidai. (These two households are the present leaders of all the Lasakau people)NLC Tukutuku Raraba Yavusa Nabou, Lasakau, Bau, 1933, p. 51. There is strong genealogical and traditional evidence that suggests that the ancestors of these two households originated from within the Tui Kaba Vunivalu clan and not the Nabou Tunidau ni Bau clan as made out. In all likelihood the 'Mataqalikira' refers in fact to the 'Mataqali ira ni Tui Kaba' or half brothers and first cousins of Ratu Seru Cakobau given the contention for power that was rife within the Vunivalu clan at the zenith of Bauan political struggles from 1800 to the Battle of Kaba in 1855. In fact in his detailed drawing of the Islet of Bau in 1856 Joseph Waterhouse (minister) singles out Cakobau and Lasakau chief Kolivisawaqa II, also known as Kamikamica, and son of Ratu Loaloadravu Tubuanakoro who was also known as Kolivisawaqa, the elder half brother of Cakobau, residential sites or yavus from all others, signifying their high status in Bauan society.Marshall David Sahlins, ‚ÄòApologies to Thucydides: Understanding History as Culture‚Äô, University of Chicago Press, 2004, See p, 32 for Bau Islet plan- 1856 McGillivray described Kolivisawaqa‚Äôs house Nacokula as \\" the neatest he has seen in Fiji, with a number of chests of drawers, some trunks and other European goods in it.\\"David:1995:111 French Captain Dumont D'Urville in his 1827 expedition of the Fiji archipelago, was amazed at Tubuanakoro's seafaring skills and knowledge of the group of islands when Cakobau's elder half brother acted as pilot on board his ship the Astrolabe. Captain D'Urville was particularly taken by Tubuanakoro's \\"dignity and intelligence, gentle manners, agreeable appearance and accommodating character\\".Marshall David Sahlins, ‚ÄòApologies to Thucydides: Understanding History as Culture‚Äô, University of Chicago Press, 2004, See pp. 52-53 Ratu Loaloadravu Tubuanakoro, portrait 1827 aboard French Brig Astrolabe. The surname 'Kamikamica' or 'sweet' that survives in the Nacokula household today is an allusion to the personable, genial and gracious character of Ratu Loaloadravu Tubuanakoro alias Kolivisawaqa I. He was slain by Bauan rebels in antipathy to his father Ratu Tanoa Visawaqa's rule as Vunivalu. Tubuanakoro's son was also named ' Kolivisawaqa II to immortalize the fallen chief. According to another source Kolivisawaqa as chief of Lasakau was killed by his brother Tutekovuya because of Koli‚Äôs loyalty to the deposed Vunivalu Ratu Tanoa. Osbourne 1966:55 mentions Koli as ‚ÄúRev Lorimer Fison knew a Lasakauan, whose admiring countrymen, to give him his due, called him, Kolivisawaqa. Warrior and club went on to fame together‚Äù.Fison:1871b:31 Another of Ratu Tubuanakoro's son was Ratu Vuniani Vukinamualevu (1819-1888) who was also Roko Tui Ba in the 1880s. Owing to his chiefly lineage and nursing the plotted murder of his father, Ratu Vuki was often at odds with Ratu Cakobau and the colonial administration.Deryck Scarr,\\"A rokotui for Lomaiviti: The question of legitimacy in the Fijian administration 1874-1900\\" Journal of Pacific History, Jan 1970,5(1) 3-31. Warlords Capell in his study of Fijian history stated that, \\"the history of Fiji is the history of chiefly families\\".Capell, A, 'Local Divisions and Movements in Fiji', Oceania; 11, (1940/41) p. 313 The phrase in fact emphasized the hierarchical nature of Fijian traditional society where chiefly power was absolute. The relationship between Chiefs and Westerners in especially Missionaries thus became a focal point for gathering insight into Fijian culture and tradition in the nineteenth century. On the rise of the Matanitu of Bau, David Routledge pointed out that the \\".. support of the Lasakau was necessary to stability on Bau, even though they were not of the ruling family\\".David Routledge, 'Matanitu: The Struggle for Power in early Fiji', USP, 1985, p. 77. Adolf Brewster described the Lasakau as ... ‚Äúthe Royal Fishermen, a highly important and powerful clan, who like our Marines were soldiers and sailors too, as they were warriors in addition to their ordinary calling.‚ÄùAdolf Brewster, The Hill Tribes of Fiji, Seeley Service and Co Press, 1922, p. 165. The feats of the warmongering Lasakau tribe became widespread and abhorred by Missionaries such as Reverend Williams who stated, \\"The Lasakau people especially, were widely known as dangerous men (tamata rerevaki)\\"..\\"Very bloodthirsty and cruel\\". Reverend Jagger said of the Lasakau, \\" much feared on that account, the circumstance of them having plenty of canoes at their command enables them the more effectively to carry their schemes into practice\\".Fiji and the Fijians, Rev Williams, 3 Mar 1845 Ratu Tanoa Visawaqa, Vunivalu of Bau. (1929-52) The introduction of firearms in tribal skirmishes by Bau added to their naval superiority. From 1803 to 1829, during Ratu Naulivou's reign as Vunivalu of Bau, the islet kingdom reached the zenith of its power. Naulivou recruited European beachcombers as mercenaries into his Bauan forces and was able to make good use of this advantage to further his political control. Mercenary Charlie Savage fought alongside Bauan forces in many skirmishes and was given the title Koroinavunivalu. He terrorized Bau's enemies with his musketry though this did not spare him from the club. In 1813 he was ambushed along with others in the sandalwood trade skirmishes in Bua, Vanua Levu. At the time of Naulivou‚Äôs death though, Bau was well on the way to establishing a Fiji-wide political hegemony founded on sea power and western fire arms. During the reign of Naulivou (1803‚Äì1829) probably around 1810, there was an internal power struggle in Lasakau due to the rise of the Tui Kaba Vunivalu as the premiere chief in Bau. This led to the banishment of the sacred king, the Vuaniivi Roko Tui Bau to Vanua Balavu, Lau. See Turaga na Rasau. This inversion of the chiefly role led to drawn out internal strife on the island. In Lasakau, the Tunidaunibau clan succumbed to the Mataqalikira. The Mataqalikira supported the Tui Kaba Vunivalu in the overthrow of the Roko Tui Bau. This struggle continued during the time of Ratu Tanoa Visawaqa and his son Ratu Seru Epenisa Cakobau. Riven with intra-tribal schisms, a faction of the Tui Kaba had ousted Ratu Tanoa as Vunivalu. In 1837, Ratu Seru re-installed his father Tanoa through a plot with the Lasakau Mataqalikira headed by Tutekovuya. Ratu Seru Apenisa Cakobau Vunivalu of Bau. (1852-1883) Around the early nineteenth century the contention for ascendency in the Kubuna hierarchy of Bau between the Roko Tui Bau and the Vunivalu Tui Kaba spilled over to Lasakau. The Tunidaunibau who were loyal to the Roko Tui Bau was overpowered by the Mataqalikira. This subversion of the Roko Tui Bau by the Tui Kaba Vunivalu was gained and alliance with the Mataqalikira sealed by marriages to Bauan ladies of rank. Sahlins typifies this relationship of the Sea warriors or Kai wai and the paramount chief as, \\"always of outside origin and condition, considered different people or Kai tani, even when long established within the chiefdom, such service are attached to the paramount service by founding gift of a royal daughter\\". However, there is genealogical evidence that suggests that the chiefly male ancestors of Nacokula and Nadrukuta were indeed descendants of the Vunivalu Tui Kaba line from Ratu Tanoa Visawaqa, Ratu Caucau and Ratu Vuibureta.Marshall David Sahlins, Islands of History, University of Chicago Press, 1985, p. 100. Consequently the daughters of Bau's sacred King, the Roko Tui Bau, Adi Vuniwaqa and Adi Sivo and Adi Litiana of the Tui Kaba, were betrothed to Lasakau chiefs; Caucau,Tutekovuya and Kolivisawaqa II . In addition, Adi Loloakubou the half sister of Cakobau was given as a bride to notorious Lasakau chief Ratu Gavidi. This traditional marriage is vividly captured by Mary Wallis in 1851.Mary Davis Wallis, Life in Feejee: or, Five years amongst Cannibals, H. E. Hewes and Co. Printers, Boston, 1851, pp. 240-243 Adi Kaunilotuma of the Tui Kaba clan was also later given to Ratu Isoa Tuituba son of Gavidi. Ratu Gavidi Lasakau Chief 1840s. Power struggles The rise of the Mataqalikira clan of Lasakau began with Ratu Tubuanakoro alias Kolivisawaqa I, Tutekovuya and Tuisavura alias Gavidi. In 1832 Ratu Tubuanakoro, vasu to Gau and Cakobau‚Äôs half brother, was slain by rebels on Bau who were against his Father Tanoa's rule. Routledge's account of Tubuanakoro's demise was that he was disposed of by his half brother Tutekovuya.David Routledge, Matanitu, 1985, p. 51 Tubuanakoro through his mother and first wife of Tanoa, Adi Vereivalu was vasu levu to the Takala- i- Gau clan, of Sawaike. Ratu Tubuanakoro with his army of Lasakau marauders, hence had great authority over Gau island and the Lomaiviti group of islands as a whole. As Tanoa's trusted collector of tribute and wealth this may have led to his demise at the hands of rebels including his half brother Tutekovuya, the vasu-i- Tamavua Naitasiri. Ratu Nalila and his father Maibole of the Tunidaunibau then later deposed Tutekovuya in 1840. Tutekovuya was the Lasakau leader and co-conspirator with Ratu Seru Cakobau‚Äôs in 1837, where Bau was destroyed and Ratu Tanoa restored as the Vunivalu. Tutekovuya is a 'ravu' name shortened for 'he that set fire to the great Bauan temple of Dulukovuya', that was bestowed on the Lasakau chief after Cakobau's successful counter-coup. The support of the Roko Tui Dreketi to Lasakau was crucial in the success of this coup in which Tanoa the vasu to Rewa was re- installed though Cakobau was the power behind the throne. Later Ratu Gavidi then disposed of Nalila in revenge of Tute his half brother's death. Nalila from the Tunidau sub-clan was contending ascendency with Gavidi of the Mataqalikira clan among the Lasakau people. The phrase Verevakabau became synonymous with Bauan politics and the ongoing struggle for power. Through the successful coup of 1837 the name Ca ko Bau (Destroyer of Bau)According to one account there was an older chief with the same name whom Seru was named after. (Capt Eagleston account 1832 and see Routledge:1985:56) was conferred upon Ratu Seru and Ga(sau)vidi upon Tuisavura II. Many recorded contacts in the 1830s and 1840s such as with Commodore Charles Wilkes, Captain John Erskine and Reverend Calvert, place Lasakau chief Gavidi as Cakobau's leading enforcer. In 1849 Captain Erskine of H.B.M. ship Havannah wrote,\\" The town or city of Bau seems to consist of three divisions: viz; Soso, Bau, Lasakau; the latter meaning the fishermen, of whom Gavidi is chief, being next in importance to Thakombau, and his great friend.\\"Waterhouse:1866:159 Ratu Gavidi was later killed in battle at Verata in 1850. In an account of his death Rev Waterhouse revealed, \\"Two things are quite certain: first, that Cakobau was unusually anxious during the attack, and his mind seemed to be occupied with something else rather than with the battle; and, second, that as soon as Gavidi was killed, the signal was given for general retreat, after which the attack was not repeated.\\" Waterhouse:1866:179 Another account stated that it was witnessed that Cakobau's \\"anxiety was high\\" as the Lasakau chief forayed too deep into the Veratan battle lines and \\"was shot in the back\\". His death so demoralized the Bauan army that they withdrew from the battlefield. His body was taken back to Lasakau and buried in Nadrakuta, his home which was built to honour his mother Adi Vuniwaqa the daughter of the Roko Tui Bau. In Lasakau folklore, Cakobau's erstwhile companion Gavidi always sailed with him on the Vunivalu's war canoe the Ramarama to war. On the expedition to his last battle at Verata, Gavidi 'sailed separately' hence the surname 'Vodo vakatani' that exists in the Nadrakuta household today. Alliances Vunivalu Ratu Seru Cakobau gave his half-sister Adi Loloakubou in marriage to Ratu Gavidi of Lasakau. Adi Loloakubou's mother was Adi Talatoka, the Radi-Levuka, the first consort of the Vunivalu Ratu Tanoa and daughter of the Tui Cakau. This marriage alliance in essence strengthened the Vunivalu's control of the Lasakau people's seafaring role as chief purveyors for the islet Kingdom. Ratu Cakobau had also promised another prominent chief, the Tui Nakelo his sister in marriage to gain his support in the war against Rewa. This he obviously reneged on, which greatly displeased the Tui Nakelo. The warrior chief of the Rewa delta in kind changed allegiance to the Roko Tui Dreketi of Rewa in opposition to Bau. At Gavidi's death and in breaking with traditional mourning practices, the people of Lasakau pleaded with Ratu Cakobau that Adi Loloakubou, be spared the custom of wife strangulation as she was with child. Subsequently she gave birth to a son, Ratu Isoa Tuituba. Adi Loloakubou after the death of Ratu Gavidi was later betrothed to Ratu Mara Kapaiwai (1815‚Äì59)-cousin and a fierce rival of Cakobau, and the father of Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi, (1859‚Äì1920) the leading Fijian administrator of his day. Ratu Isoa Tuituba, the Komai Nadrukuta married Adi Litia Kaunilotuma of the Vunivalu Tui Kaba clan. Ratu Vodovakatani I, Ratu Inoke Takiveikata I, Adi Monika Tuikilakila, Adi Unaisi Lewakikau and Adi Alumeci Tatila were born from this union and ensured the Nadrukuta household prominence in Lasakau. Adi Tuikilakila was Ratu Isoa Gavidi II and Ratu Inoke Takiveikata's II mother. Ratu Inoke was acting Vice-President of Fiji in the 1990s. As Vasu Levu to Lasakau Ratu Inoke was honoured as Komai Nadrukuta. He was married to Adi Sainimili Rokoyau of Lomanikoro Rewa. Adi Lewakikau married Ratu Saimone Mumulovo Dobui of the chiefly household of the Tora Naibati Clan of Naibati, Buretu Tailevu. Ratu Ilaitia Kalokalolevu, Adi Alumeci Tatila and Ratu Apenisa Nayavulagi were born from this union. This union further strengthened close blood ties between Ratu Cakobau and the Tora Naibati household. Ratu Tevita Vodovakatani II, the Komai Nadrukuta (?-1990) and long time engineer on the Governor's vessel the Ramarama, was Ratu Inoke Takiveikata's I son from Roko Naisua of the Tui Moala and also blood linked to Nacokula. Ratu Vodovakatani II married Adi Asenaca Rarogo of the Nabaubau-Rokotui Bau. Their issues were Reverend Ratu Inoke Takiveikata, Adi Litia Vuniwaqa, Ratu Eroni Cinavilakeba, Adi Viniana Tuirewa, Adi Finau, Adi Qolikoro and Roko Naisua. WPC 742, Adi Litia Vuniwaqa was one of the first Fijian female police officers passing-out in December 1970. The arranged marriage of women of status to gain or seal political alliances was often practised by monarchies in ancient times. Hence Bauan ladies of the Roko Tui Bau and the Tui Kaba were likewise married off to chiefly households of Rewa, Naitasiri, Cakaudrove and Lau. Similarly through such marriages the chiefly clans of the Tui Ba- Nailaga, Takala i Gau of Sawaieke, Gau island and the Tui Moala of Naroi, Moala are kinsmen to the chiefs of Lasakau. In fact, the surname 'Kamikamica' and the yavu name 'Nacokula' are still used by the chiefs of Sawaike, Naroi, Dravo, Beqa and Nailaga today. These strategic familial links reinforced Bauan supremacy on the western coast of Viti Levu, Lomaiviti and the yasayasa Moala Lau group of islands. Ratu Seru Cakobau is said, to have been reared as a child, on Gau island in Lomaiviti and Moala island in Lau. Honours Tubuanakoro (1803-1832), chief of Lasakau and son of Tanoa, for his warrior prowess was bestowed the title Koli-visawaqa I by Tanoa Visawaqa, ‚ÄòBurner of Boats‚Äô, who reigned from 1829 to 1852 as the Vunivalu of Bau. Koli was Tanoa's leading warrior during the struggle and banishment of the Roko Tui Bau Vuaniivi from Bau. This struggle and inversion of the chiefly hierarchy invariably escalated to wars with the kingdoms of Verata and Rewa. The Bauans had a penchant for bestowing honorific titles on their more accomplished warriors as prefixes to their names or yaca ni ravu. The names Koli,Koroi and Waqa are the more exalted prefixes. Furthermore the title Koli is the prefix for a slayer of ten and 'visa' for a slayer of twenty. The title \\"Kolivisawaqa\\" I as an example was bestowed on Lasakau and Bauan chief Rabonu alias Ratu Tubuanakoro. Through the main support of Kolivisawaqa I and his Lasakau clan, the Vunivalus Naulivou and Tanoa gained ascendency in the eastern parts of the Fiji archipelago. Again the name of Lasakau chief Gavidi is a yaca ni ravu and short for 'Gasauvidi'. The name is an allusion to the burning arrows and reed fences set ablaze by the Lasakau on the night of the 1837 coup that re- installed Cakobau's father Tanoa as Vunivalu. Gavidi was Cakobau's main warrior during the young Tui Kaba chief's ascendency. Both their mothers Adi Vuniwaqa and Adi Savusavu were of the Roko Tui Bau. Adi Vuniwaqa was earlier betrothed to Ratu Caucau son of Vunivalu Ratu Banuve. Out of that union came Ratu Nayagodamu and Adi Litia Vatea. Clash with Christianity Kolivisawaqa's I son Kolivisawaqa II succeeded Gavidi after his death at Verata in April 1850. His siding with Ratu Cakobau and King George of Tonga's Christian forces at the Battle of Kaba (1855) was critical to the defeat of rebel forces led by Ratu Mara Kapaiwai and Ratu Ravulo of the Vusaradave. This was initially not the case. As told by Rev Calvert, \\"I feared that danger was at hand, mainly, I thought, through Koli-i-Visa Wanq-qa [sic] head chief of the Bau fishermen who was holding intercourse with Mara the rebel chief who had joined the King of Rewa.\\" Cakobau realising the dire predicament he was in urged Rev Calvert, \\"There is one thing that may be useful, do you keep close intercourse with Koli.\\"G. C. Henderson, Fiji and the Fijians 1835-1856, Angus and Robertson ,1931, p. 268. Apparently, Cakobau was weary of intra-Tui Kaba conspiracy for the title of Vunivalu given that Kolivisawaqa II was a powerful close relative of his. Kolivisawaqa II however later joined rebel chiefs in creating dissention to Cakobau's rule. In 1859, he was captured along with other rebel chiefs, Ratu Mara Kapaiwai, Naulivou and Ratu Isikeli (Tui Viwa) for resisting the spread of Christianity. They were tried but they escaped. Ratu Mara and Ratu Naulivou were later recaptured, tried and hung on 6 August 1859. Later Koli after being pardoned became a Christian. He eventually featured prominently in all other Bauan Christian wars and pacification campaigns in particular at Ba in the 1860s and 70s. Bau Spirit House at Ucui Nabou and Lasakau shoreline scene.

Calvert, was given as a wife Adi Litiana (daughter of Ratu Masivesi another son of Tanoa) of the Tui Kaba.Murray P Heasley, 'The Life and Times of Cakobau:the Bauan State to 1855', PhD Thesis, Otago University Press, 1983, p.245. Out of this union came a son, Ratu Viliame Kamikamica I whose eldest son was Ratu Maika Rabonu from Adi Lewamoqe. Ratu Viliame also later married Adi Mere Kula of the Masau clan and later Adi Litia Raikoro of the Tui Cakau of Somosomo Taveuni. From Adi Litia he had seven children: Adi Litiana, Ratu Filimoni, Ratu Sakiusa, Ratu Viliame, Ratu Filimoni II, Adi Lele and Adi Wati. From Adi Mereoni Kula of the Masau, Kamikamica had a son Ratu Pio Tini(1887-1928) and a daughter Adi Stela. Ratu Pio and Adi Stella were born in Levuka and their Christian names signify that they were most probably baptized in the Roman Catholic faith. This was probably due to Kolivisawaqa‚Äôs falling- out period with Cakobau and the Wesleyan missionaries. Many chiefs after the Battle of Kaba in 1855 still sided with rebel Bau chief Ratu Mara Kapaiwai. They saw Wesleyanism as a Cakobau and Tongan conspiracy for political supremacy. This was one of the reasons for some high chiefs opting to convert to Roman Catholicism. Furthermore Koli's move to adopting Catholicism would have stemmed more from a political motive due to the Wesleyan missionaries abhorrence of his tribe's pillaging and plundering, the raison d'etre, of Lasakau's sea warriors. Ratu Maika had four daughters who married into other noble houses of other provinces. Adi Sainimili Lewamoqe married the Tui Ba, Adi Mereani Salele married Ro Etuate Navakamocea Mataitini, the Vunivalu of Rewa.Genealogy Adi Mereoni Nawaibau, and Adi Josivini Maisavu also married into leading Kubuna clans. Kamikamica's I son Ratu Pio Tini Kamikamica had three son's and two daughters. Ratu Viliame Kamikamica III (1915‚Äì64) and Adi Kelera Kataogo (1911‚Äì1980) followed from his union with Silafaga Paniani (1876‚Äì1918) of the Ainu'u Maliatoa clan of Sapapali'i village Savaii Samoa and another son, Ratu Qionikoro whose mother was a Ms Wedlock. Kamikamica's I daughters, Adi Stela was married to Ratu Filimoni Loco, Tui Sawakasa and had a son Ratu Ovini Loco. His youngest daughter was Rokonaisua from a lady of Naroi Moala. Ratu Viliame Kamikamica III had two children from Teuila Tunufai Selio of Sale'aula village Savaii Samoa, Adi Silafaga and Ratu Alisada Vodo Kamikamica. Ratu Viliame Kamikamica's III second marriage to Sala Ahome'e-a half-sister of Queen Mata'aho of Tonga produced two children, Ratu Jiale Kamikamica and Adi Kelera Kamikamica. Colonies of Bau The Lasakau fishermen were in essence the Bauan navy. These sea warriors projected nascent Bauan traditional power throughout eastern Fiji. As seafarers their dominating reach by the use of huge sailing war canoes established Bauan colonies in various villages on Gau, Moala, Vanuabalavu, Nairai and coastal Tailevu and Ba. The earlier banished Butoni and Levuka people of Bau also settled in Taveuni, Macuata, Koro, Lakeba and Kadavu. These sea people formed a network of colonies and auxiliaries of the islet kingdom of Bau. Hence well beyond the tiny islet's horizon, Bau was able to levy food, traditional wealth and more importantly war canoes through the Lasakau sea warriors. From these kinsmen villages all over the Fiji Islands, Bau was able to sub-jugate contending chiefdoms and extract tribute. Tanoa and the Rise of the Matanitu of Kubuna i Wai Much of our understanding of pre-contact Fijian history has been interpreted through the observations and writings of missionaries such as Reverends Williams, Calvert and Waterhouse from the cockpit of Bauan culture and tradition. Indeed the rise of Bau as the leading Fijian chiefdom in the first half of the nineteenth century was closely witnessed by these pioneering missionaries and their women folk such as Mary Wallis. Their understanding of unfolding events on Bau were often taken at face value without the full knowledge of intra familial intrigue afoot at the time. This is an account of the untold story of the rise to power of the Vunivalu Ratu Tanoa Visawaqa through the Lasakau sea warriors and the matanitu of Kubuna i Wai primarily gleaned from the Native Land Commission‚Äôs Tukutuku raraba for Lasakau. It was accepted that Kubuna i wai was a maritime territory aligned to the matanitu of Kubuna centred on Bau. The area mainly consisted of islands in the Lomaiviti group and yasayasa Moala. The origin of the political entity of Kubuna i wai was due in the main to the rise of Tanoa and was centred in the neighbouring fishermen village of Lasakau. Tanoa‚Äôs Kubuna i wai chiefdom had rivalled Bauan traditional hegemony from about 1820-1855. This intra-tribal Tui Kaba conflict led to the 1832 usurpation and seven year banishment of Tanoa. Since European contact in the early nineteenth century the position of Bauan war lord had gained significant power along Fiji‚Äôs eastern coast and windward islands. Sibling vasu rivalry was rife for the title of Vunivalu. Tanoa it seems had set up a rival chiefdom to his brother Naulivou‚Äôs Bauan chiefdom in Lasakau. Prior to succeeding his brother Naulivou at Muaidule, Bau as Vunivalu in 1829, Tanoa had led the Lasakau sea marauders as chief purveyor of tribute throughout the Fiji islands. The role had given Tanoa great wealth and prestige and naturally he became a rival to his brother. It is said that a scar at the back of his head was from Naulivou‚Äôs war club. In fact through the leadership prowess of Tanoa, Lasakau supported by its colonies in Lomaiviti, Moala and Ba became a rival chiefdom to Naulivou and Bau. The traditional account of Naulivou‚Äôs demise was that he died as a result of an outbreak of a European disease hence his posthumous name ‚ÄòRamatenikutu'. Another account, however, states Tanoa had plotted his demise. Tanoa had previously built his main residence where he housed the first of his nine wives Adi Vereivalu in Lasakau. His imposing residence, known as Nacokula was replete with its own docking bay and overflowed with tributes from afar. Because of his terrorizing tactics and fierceness for extracting tribute he was bestowed the name ‚ÄòVisawaqa‚Äô-the burner of boats. Tanoa‚Äôs eldest son from Vereivalu was Ratu Loloadravu Tubuanakoro who was vasu to the chiefdom of Sawaike on Gau Island. He was renowned as a sailor/navigator. As was customary he was bestowed the warrior name Kolivisawaqa obviously in honour of his father. In the 1856 Rev Waterhouse plan of the island of Bau, the largest yavu in Lasakau of Nacokula was labelled as Kolivisawaqa‚Äôs (alias Kamikamica and grandson of Tanoa) residence. One of the more significant historical event of the nineteenth century in Fijian folklore was Ratu Seru and the Lasakaun internal coup of 1837 that was to define Bauan and indeed Fijian traditional politics into the future. What is unclear is the internal relationship and dynamics that underpinned this significant historical event. In 1832 riven with intra tribal competition Tanoa was banished from the island by a competing faction from within his Tui Kaba clan. In addition Tanoa‚Äôs son Tubuanakoro was murdered as a result of this purge. It is said Seru who was in his early teen was not seen as a threat hence his life was spared and he was left to his youthful pursuits on the island. In the next five years however, young Seru set about the plot to restore his father Tanoa as Vunivalu. The plot gained an immediate hold in Lasakau the centre of Tanoa's Kubuna i wai chiefdom. Apparently the Lasakauns were eager to avenge Tubuanakoro Kolivisawaqa's death at the hands of Tanoa's enemies. The native Bauan poem immortalizing the rise of Cakobau as translated into English in Reverend Joseph Waterhouse‚Äôs pioneering historic work, The King and people of Fiji, is perhaps the closest insider account of the 1837 counter-revolution on the island. The poem from oral tradition encode verse meaning with the use of allegory and allusion known only to those knowledgeable of Bauan political and intra-tribal intrigues of the time. In memory of Cakobau Rev Joseph Waterhouse, 'The King and people of Fiji', London, 1866, pp.64-65. I Cakobau strolls about as if careless, His plot is deep under the ground. They consult, talk and are silent, Komainavalecaqou has done wrong, (Rebel leader Tuiveikoso‚Äôs war club) He has not killed Loloadravu, (sarcasm as Tubuanakoro of Lasakau was assassinated) Cakobau is repairing a canoe, (conspiring with his cousins Tute, Koli and Gavidi in Lasakau) He is relashing the Tui Nayau, (a Drua and allusion to his uncle Vuibureta vasu to Lakeba) A raft to carry the Vunivalu‚Äôs plot; Its flags hang in ornament, (an allusion to Koli and Vuibureta‚Äôs sons; Tute, Gavidi and Mara) The conspiracy is agreed to in Lasakau, The chiefs of the fishermen offer to fight, (chiefs of Nacokula and Nadrukuta) Butako-i-valu is supplied with kava; ( Lasakau God of war) The prayer ‚Äúlet Caucau die‚Äù. ( Cakobau‚Äôs uncle and rebel leader of Tuiveikoso regime) II Cakobau and Tutekovuya; And they two tear asunder the land, Then roars the sound of the flames. Apparently Seru's plot with the Lasakaun and Rewan support was well concealed. Evidently Tanoa was vasu to Rewa and had a ready army of supporters in Lasakau the centre of his Kubuna i wai chiefdom. Here indeed lies a story of family and intra-tribal intrigue. Tanoa and his son Seru were supported by the chiefs of the fishermen clan who had built for them a contending Bauan chiefdom of Kubuna i wai. The plot and intra tribal massacre in essence restored the tyrant Ratu Tanoa as Vunivalu and established his son Ratu Seru ‚ÄòCakobau‚Äô-the destroyer of Bau as leading Fijian chief of the era. The demise of Lasakau chief‚Äôs Kolivisawaqa, Tutekovuya and Gavidi of the Kubuna i wai chiefdom in 1832, 1840 and 1850 respectively at the hands of their close clansmen most probably was the outcome of the rivalry for power that prevailed at the zenith of Bauan traditional political hegemony.

He returned to France briefly, where he played for Guingamp, before settling in England, with spells at Swindon Town and Sheffield United. Qualifying to represent Haiti through his parents, Jean-Fran√ßois made three appearances for the national side. Club career=Early career= Jean-Fran√ßois began his career in France, coming through the youth ranks of Paris Saint-Germain before joining CS Sedan Ardennes. In January 2006, he signed for Scottish Premier League side Falkirk, where he made a handful of appearances before departing the club at the end of the season to join French Ligue 2 side En Avant de Guingamp. In July 2008, he was named as a trialist for Aberdeen in their pre- season friendly match against Brechin City, but he failed to win a contract. =Swindon Town= In late January 2009 he arrived at Swindon Town and appeared in a reserve match against Swansea City, and impressed manager Danny Wilson sufficiently for him to offer him a contract until the end of the 2008‚Äì09 season. Jean-Fran√ßois eventually made his d√©but for Swindon in February 2009, making a total of five appearances by the end of the season. As a result of these performances he was one of four out of contract players offered new contracts in May 2009. and signed a one-year extension the following month. =Sheffield United= After being released by Swindon, Jean- Fran√ßois joined up with former boss Danny Wilson once more, signing for Sheffield United in June 2011. After making his d√©but for his new club on the opening day of the season, away at Oldham Athletic he appeared regularly at left back until he sustained a cruciate ligament injury the following March which ruled him out for the remainder of the season. In October 2012 he returned from injury and played the last 15 minutes in a 4‚Äì1 victory over Notts County at Meadow Lane in the Football League Trophy, however he injured his other knee and was ruled out for a further 2 months. Having failed to regain his fitness for the remainder of the season, Jean-Fran√ßois was released by United in June 2013. In December 2013 Jean-Fran√ßois returned to former club Sheffield United to continue his rehabilitation process. This was agreed following his release in the summer, but new United manager Nigel Clough stated \\"there is no deal on the table.\\" International career Despite being born in French Guiana, Jean-Fran√ßois qualifies to play for Haiti as it is the birthplace of his parents. Following his move to Sheffield United his form prompted a recall to the Haiti national team in 2011 to face Antigua and Barbuda for World Cup qualifiers. After the earthquake in Haiti, Jean- Fran√ßois's home nation, money from the match between Swindon Town, his team at the time, and Leeds United was donated to help the disaster in Haiti.

It can be considered an extension, or sub-field, of both computational physics and geophysics. In recent years, computational power, data availability, and modelling capabilities have all improved exponentially, making computational geophysics a more populated discipline. Due to the large computational size of many geophysical problems, high-performance computing can be required to handle analysis. Modeling applications of computational geophysics include atmospheric modelling, oceanic modelling, general circulation models, and geological modelling. In addition to modelling, some problems in remote sensing fall within the scope of computational geophysics such as tomography, inverse problems, and 3D reconstruction.  Geophysical models  The generation of geophysical models are a key component of computational geophysics. Geophysical models are defined as \\"physical-mathematical descriptions of temporal and/or spatial changes in important geological variables, as derived from accepted laws, theories, and empirical relationships.\\" Geophysical models are frequently used by researchers in all disciplines of environmental science. In climate science, atmospheric, oceanic, and general circulation models are a crucial standby for researchers. Although remote sensing has been steadily providing more and more in-situ measurements of geophysical variables, nothing comes close to the temporal and geospatial resolution of data provided by models. Although data can be subject to accuracy issues due to the extrapolation techniques used, the usage of modeled data is a commonly accepted practice in climate and meteorological sciences. Oftentimes, these models will be used in concert with in-situ measurements. A few well-known models are # NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis Project, an atmospheric model # Global Forecast System, a numerical weather prediction model # HYCOM, a general ocean circulation model Geological system models are frequently used in research, but have less public data availability than climatic and meteorological models. There is a wide range of software available that allows for geomodelling.  Remote sensing  The United States Geological Survey (USGS) defines remote sensing as the measurement of some property by transmitting some type of radiation at a distance, and measuring the emitted and reflected radiation. Remote sensing can involve satellites, cameras, and sound wave emission. Remote sensing is inherently a type of indirect measurement, meaning that some type of computation must be completed in order to obtain a measurement of the property of interest. For some applications, these computations can be highly complex. In addition, the analysis of these data products can be classified as computational geophysics.  Programs of study  In Canada, computational geophysics is offered as a university major in the form of a BSc (Hon.) with co-op at Carleton University. Elsewhere, Rice University has a Center for Computational Geophysics, while Princeton University, the University of Texas, and California Institute of Technology have similar research centers. Experts, laboratories, projects, internships, undergraduate programs, graduate programs and/or facilities in the program exist at the University of Queensland, Wyoming University, Boston University, Stanford University, Uppsala University, Kansas State University, Kingston University, Australian National University, University of California, San Diego, University of Washington, ETH Zurich, University of Sydney, Appalachian State University, University of Minnesota, University of Tasmania, Bahria University, Boise State University, University of Michigan, University of Oulu, University of Utah, and others.

Formerly a small village in its own right, it is situated between the Sean Walsh Park and the River Dodder. A bawn is the defensive wall surrounding an Irish tower house. It is the anglicised version of the Irish word b√°bh√∫n, meaning \\"cattle-stronghold\\" or \\"cattle-enclosure\\" History Old Bawn was the site of an estate for several centuries, and later of a small village, whose population reached over 380 in the mid-19th century to the Current numbers of near 14,000. McInerney Homes began construction of the Old Bawn Housing Estate as it lies today, in the 1970s. These 3 Bed Semi detached homes with Garages first sold for on average ¬£3,700 Irish Pounds or ‚Ç¨4,700. =Old Bawn House= Old Bawn House was built in 1635 by Archdeacon William Bulkeley, son of Launcelot Bulkeley the Archbishop.http://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/history- heritage/architecture/pre-1850-houses-in-south-/tallaght/m-o/ It was situated where the St. Maelruan's school now stands. It was almost unique in architectural style, being one of the first Irish houses that was not built purely for defence. Oldbawn had extensive pleasure gardens that survived, albeit in a neglected state, until 1900. \\"From a rude, desolate, and wild land he brought it to a most delightful patrimony\\" Handcock quoted Blacker as saying of Bulkeley's house. Old Bawn House was damaged in the rebellion of 1641 but was restored immediately at a cost of ¬£3,000. The house was designed in an H shape with high pointed gables, and had many windows and twelve chimneys which was unusual at that time. It had many internal features such as the chimney piece and a carved oak staircase, both of which are in the National Museum of Ireland. The chimney piece reached to the ceiling and depicted the building of the walls of Jerusalem, dating back to 1635. There was also an unusual lodge house built to the front of the house. Old Bawn House was enclosed by a wide fosse with a drawbridge. To the south of the house there was a large pleasure garden laid out with walks, ponds and tree- lined avenues. The house passed to Lady Tynte who leased it. In 1830, Old Bawn was bought by the McDonnell family who established a paper mill behind the house. This was one of many mills along the Dodder in the nineteenth century. The house fell into disrepair during the early 1900s and was used as a storehouse when the lands were being developed in the 1960s, and eventually Old Bawn house gave way to the new developments in the area, now the site of the Maelruans Primary School.

Born  Reddy was born on 11 January 1967. He has two brothers, G. Karunakara Reddy and G. Somashekara Reddy, and an elder sister, Rajeswari. He and his siblings were born in Bellary, Karnataka to Rukminamma and Chenga Reddy, a police constable.  Education  Janardhana Reddy has a pre-university college education  Career  Reddy is an entrepreneur and a politician. = As an Entrepreneur = At the age of 21, Reddy established a residuary non-banking finance company called, Ennoble India Savings & Investment Company Limited, under the RBI in 1989. Across South India, the company had a total of 125 branches with a turnover of 350 crores. While the company was still functioning, it has stopped collecting deposits from 2003. He surrendered the Certificate of Registration to the RBI once all the money was returned with interest to depositors. Reddy was the first person from the non-banking sector in India to obtain an appreciation letter from the RBI. In 2001, he took over Obulapuram Mining Company (OMCPL) which had an iron-ore mining lease. The lease area contained large quantities of iron-ore lines although there was no market for these at the time. His dissenters assumed that acquiring OMCPL would be his downfall but the steady increases in iron-ore prices due to China‚Äôs construction boom proved the opposite. Allegedly, his political clout helped him to get the iron-ore mining license in Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh in 2004. He established the Bramhani Industries, a steel manufacturing unit, in the Kadapa district and gave employment to 10,000+ people. = As a politician = Reddy came into political spotlight during the 1999 Lok Sabha elections when the Reddy brothers were working as part of Sushma Swaraj's campaign. At the time, Swaraj had been competing as a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate in Bellary against Sonia Gandhi, who belonged to the Indian National Congress, to become the MP. Although Swaraj was unsuccessful, she remained a patron of the Reddy‚Äôs and was known to visit Bellary frequently. After the Reddy brothers were charged during the mining scandal, Swaraj distanced herself from them. The allegations against Reddy brought a bad reputation for the BJP in Karnataka and exposed opportunistic politics in the state. In 2006, due to the BJP - Janta Dal (Secular) (JDS) coalition government and the efforts of Reddy, B. Sriramulu was made a Cabinet Minister. In 2006, Reddy was made a Member of the Legislative Council to recognize his active role in increasing the BJP presence in Bellary. However, in later years, Reddy fought with Chief Minister H. D. Kumaraswamy, and made allegations, and provided evidence of corruption, resulting in his suspension. However, H. D. Kumaraswamy did not hand over the government to B. S. Yeddyurappa at the required time. The State President of the party at the time, D. V. Sadananda Gowda and B. S. Yeddyurappa revoked Reddy‚Äôs suspension who then campaigned alongside Yeddyurappa for BJP during the Assembly Elections of 2008. Aided by Reddy‚Äôs efforts, BJP emerged as the single largest party with 110 seats and with the support of 5 independent MLA‚Äôs, BJP formed a government in South India for the first time on its own. Reddy was then inducted as the Minister for Tourism and Infrastructure and the Minister in- charge of the Bellary district, setting many developmental milestones for the state and for Bellary during this period. In spite of allegations made against Reddy and his period of judicial custody, Reddy remains a popular politician which was witnessed by the state on 29 January 2017 when Reddy received a standing ovation from a large crowd at the HemaVema function in the palace ground in Bangalore. Reddy did not contest in the Karnataka assembly polls in 2018; however, his brothers, Sriramulu and four other candidates close to Reddy received a BJP ticket.  Social service  Reddy runs a school for mentally retarded children since 1997 and an old age home from 2004 with his own funds..  Controversies  Over the years, Reddy has been involved in many controversies. = Illegal Mining = In July 2011, the Lokayukta of Karnataka, Santosh Hegde, published a report on the illegal mining activities in the Bellary region. Reddy was accused of completely rigging iron ore mining in this area and defrauding the government. Directorate General of Income Tax Investigation officials had clues to tax evasion and found that Reddy had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with a one-dollar company in Singapore to camouflage the company's income suppression. They raided the place along with other investigative agencies and formed a report which served as the basis of the report on illegal mining. Reddy is said to have designed a \\"Zero-Risk system\\" of iron ore mining, where he seamlessly provided protection to unauthorized and unaccounted mining, with active connivance from government officials at all levels. The rule of the iron ore mafia under his command was called the \\"Republic of Bellary\\" in which no external control or governance mechanism had any effect. = Bribery = The CBI is investigating the alleged bribing of the Hyderabad Special Court judge T. Pattabhirama Rao by Reddy's family members (G.Somashekar Reddy & H.Suresh Babu) in order to secure his bail in the Obulapuram Mining Company case. Further investigations by CBI implicated others, including a retired judge T.V. Chalapathi Rao, in the \\"Cash for Bail\\" scandal. The IT department issued notices and Reddy provided an explanation to the department but these explanations were rejected by the CIT Appeals. He preferred to appeal in all the matters before the Hon'ble ITAT and the Hon'ble Tribunal has allowed all appeals in his favour by dismissing the stand taken by the IT department. = Daughter's Wedding = Reddy was criticised over the lavish wedding of his daughter, Brahmani, which was held in Palace Grounds, Bangalore. He allegedly spent 500 crores ($71 million) for his daughter's wedding. Brahmani married a 23-year-old MBA graduate who hails from a family operating gold mines in South Africa, Tanzania and a granite marble businesses in Turkey. =Operation Kamala= Arrest  Reddy was arrested on 5 September 2011 by the CBI, and taken to Hyderabad, Telangana. He is accused of involvement in illegal mining of iron ore in Bellary in Karnataka and Anantapur in Andhra Pradesh. This investigation is the culmination of a recommendation to the Income Tax Department and CBI by the former Andhra Pradesh chief minister K. Rosaiah and is not directly related to the findings of Karnataka Lokayukta Santosh Hegde. Once the CBI Court heard the lawyers' representations, he along with his brother-in-law, B. V. Srinivas Reddy, was remanded to judicial custody and sent to Chanchalguda Central Jail. The CBI also arrested senior officers of the IAS and IRS during ongoing investigations. On 4 August 2012, a CBI court extended the judicial custody of Janardhana Reddy and four others arrested in the illegal mining case until 7 September. On 21 January 2015, the Supreme Court granted his bail.  References  External links  *G.

The negotiations, however, failed to reach concrete conclusions, and the Soviet advances were also detected by British Indian intelligence. Among other works, the Bravin expedition established links at Herat with the Austrian and German remnants of the Niedermayer‚ÄìHentig Expedition and liaised with the Indian revolutionaries of the Provisional Government of India in Kabul. A later plan considered by the Soviets had the raising a force of nearly 40,000 cavalry troops from Turkestan or the Urals and advance to India through Afghanistan, with help from Afghan tribes that rallied against Amanullah. However, the plans presented their own problems. Other routes to India that were explored included plans to foment unrest in Tibet and the Himalayan buffer states of Bhutan, Sikkim, Nepal, Thailand and Burma through the Buddhist Kalmyks and to use the places as a staging ground for revolution in India and the shortest route to Bengal, which was the centre of the revolutionary movement in India. That was to proceed under the cover of a scientific expedition under the Indologist Fyodor Shcherbatskoy, and it would arm the indigenous people in the North-East Frontier with modern weaponry before a regular supply could be arranged. lThe Kalmyk project may have been the brainchild of Raja Mahendra Pratap, who had led the Niedermayer-Hentig Expedition into Afghanistan in 1915 and later established the nationalist Provisional Government of India at Kabul in December that year. Pratap liaised with the Nascent Bolshevik Government and the Kaiser after 1917 to explore the scopes of a joint Soviet-German invasion of India through Afghanistan. The most notable meeting was Pratap's audience with Lenin, which was arranged by the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs in 1919, when he met him with a group of Indian revolutionaries from the Berlin Committee. The project had the approval of Lenin. Pratap had a strong obsession with Tibet and had made efforts as early as 1916 to penetrate into the Himalayan Kingdom to cultivate anti-British propaganda. His efforts were resumed after his return from Moscow in 1919. He was close to Fyodor Shcherbatskoy and Sergey Oldenburg, intended to participate in the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs planned expeditions to Tibet in summer 1919, and was privy to its designs for the region. However, the project was ultimately curtailed after the Czechoslovak uprising in the Trans-Siberian Railway. Pratap himself set out alone unsuccessfully to pursue his goal in Tibet.

Naipaul attempted to connect Rev.

Naipaul was highly critical of these and other movements, including black theology, the nascent New Age movement and EST, in as much as they helped, in his analysis, to create fertile ground for the People's Temple to flourish on the two continents. The book's US paperback cover tagline reads \\"How American ideas and ideologies led to the mass suicide of 900 people in Jonestown, Guyana.\\" Naipaul later told his father-in-law of the arresting effect that visiting Jonestown had had on him, saying that the dissipation of the earlier comic, lighter tone in his work was due to this experience.Stuart, Douglas: Foreword to An Unfinished Journey, Hamish Hamilton, 1986 References *Journey to Nowhere: A New World Tragedy, Shiva Naipaul.

Its sub-class was G 56.20 and it had triple cylinders. It was intended for hauling goods trains of up to on the routes through Germany's hilly regions (Mittelgebirge) and up to on steep inclines.  History  The first 10 examples were built in 1926. These engines had a somewhat higher steam consumption than the first ten units of the DRG Class 43 procured in parallel for comparison purposes, and which were equipped with two cylinders. Not until 1937 were further 44s procured, because by then the rising demands of rail transportation could be better met with a triple-cylinder configuration. From 1926 to 1949, a total of 1,989 locomotives were manufactured. During the Second World War an austerity variant was built with simplified construction and delivery, known as the Class 44√úK (one of the so-called √úbergangskriegslokomotive). This primarily used home-produced materials; components were simplified, both in manufacturing methods and design, or left out completely. The most striking features of the √úK locomotives were the omission of the smoke deflectors (that from 44 013 was standard) and also the forward side windows of the driver's cab. After the war, Class 44 locomotives remained with the following railway administrations: * DB (from 09/1949): 1,242 units * DR (East Germany): 335 units * PKP: 67 units (classified as Ty4) * ƒåSD: 3 units * √ñBB: 11 units * SNCF: 15 units (classified as Class 150 X alongside with 226 units found on assembly lines in French factories) *SNCB: 1 unit (war booty), traded back to West Germany in 1950 but sent to France in 1952 The Austrian Federal Railways (√ñBB) gave 9 engines back to the Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) in 1952. The DB transferred at least 291 engines to the French railways SNCF as reparations. These were predominantly locomotives that had been built in France, most of them never ran and were probably scrapped. The SNCF sold on 48 engines in 1955 to the Turkish State Railway (TCDD). DB 044 014-9 on the turntable at Trier, Easter 1972 Until their replacement by modern diesel and electric locomotives, the Class 44 engines were the backbone of heavy goods train duties in Germany. German railwaymen nicknamed the Class 44 locomotive the \\"Jumbo\\" because of its power. Only the rebuilt (Reko) locomotives of East Germany's Class 58.30, converted between 1958 and 1962, attained the performance of the Class 44s, at least on the plains.  Construction  A Class 44 cylinder and section of locomotive frame Driving axle of a Class 44 The top speed of the standard variant was 80 km/h, the prototypes (44 001 to 44 010) were permitted to run at 70 km/h. The engine is designed as a 3-cylinder locomotive with one cylinder located in the middle. The outside cylinders drive the third axle, the inside one drives the second. Standard 2'2' T 32 and 2'2' T 34 tenders were used. Both types held 10 tons of coal.  Variants  The Class 44 used a lot of steam and correspondingly large amounts of coal. In order to simplify the work and hold its power steady, 32 locomotives were converted to oil- firing by the DB in 1958 and 91 by the DR in 1963. With oil firing, the viscous fuel oil, almost solid when cold, is liquefied by a jet of steam, atomised and then combusted. The job of the stoker consists of starting the burner, greasing and pumping. The DB's oil-fired locomotives ran under the classification 043 in the new EDP-generated numbering scheme of 1968 until they were retired. These numbers were spare because all DRG Class 43 engines belonged to the DR's fleet. The engines with grate firing were given the designation 044. The DR converted 20 locomotives to Wendler coal dust firing. These proved themselves well on the ramps of the Thuringian Forest with their precise firing. However no more locomotives were converted, as oil-firing was generally favoured because it enabled unrestricted operations. Oil-fired 043 (044) class enters Rheine from the north, Easter 1974 Following the 1973 oil crisis, all oil-fired engines in the DR were reconverted to coal-firing, because they were indispensable for operations. They were given the old operating numbers that they had had before their modification to oil-firing. In the DB, they were not reconverted because they were soon due for retirement. The last coal-fired Class 44 locomotive with the DB was taken out of service in 1977 at the Gelsenkirchen-Bismarck shed. On its final journey, number 043 903-4 hauled train 81453 (consisting of a breakdown train equipment wagon) from Oldersum to Emden on 26 October 1977 for the Neubauamt Nord. It was the last scheduled steam service on the Deutsche Bundesbahn.  Preserved Locomotives  Salzbergen At present there are still two working \\"44s\\" in the world. At the 'traditional locomotive shed' at Stassfurt (Traditionsbetriebswerk Sta√üfurt), stands number 44 1486, the only current representative of her class in Germany. In addition, number 44 1593 remains operational with the Veluwsche Stoomtrein Maatschappij (VSM) in Beekbergen, Netherlands. The following non-working Class 44s can be visited in various German railway museums: *44 1093, owned by the DB Museum, in Arnstadt shed *44 1338, the former heating engine, in the Saxon Railway Museum (S√§chsisches Eisenbahnmuseum) at Chemnitz-Hilbersdorf *44 404 (see section on Trial Locomotives) in the Darmstadt-Kranichstein Railway Museum *44 1558 in Gelsenkirchen-Bismarck *44 508 in the former satellite shed at Westerburg (Westerwald) Monuments include: *043 903 remains preserved as a monument on the railway forecourt in Emden *044 389-5 as a monument in Altenbeken. Details of other locomotives are given in the list of preserved steam locomotives in Germany.  Trial Locomotives  In 1932 and 1933 the firm of Henschel built two trial locomotives designed for a raised boiler overpressure of 25 bar and equipped with four-cylinder compounding, which were also incorporated into Class 44. The two engines, which initially ran under the numbers M 01 1004 and M 01 1005, and later as 44 011 and 44 012, were certainly very powerful, but also high-maintenance. As a result, the initial boiler pressure of 25 bar was quickly reduced to 16 bar. After the Second World War, number 44 011 went to the Deutsche Bundesbahn and 44 012 to the DR. The DB engine, being a one-off, was retired as early as 1950. Number 44 012 was operated by the FVA Halle as a braking locomotive and not retired until 1962. In 1975, the repair shop at Brunswick fitted a Riggenbach counter-pressure brake to 44 404. The Bundesbahn Federal Railway Office in Minden used this engine as a braking engine to test new electric locomotives. In 1977 it was retired. It stands today in the Darmstadt-Kranichstein Railway Museum.

It is set in ancient Bagdad and borrows from the Arabic fairy tales of One Thousand and One Nights as well as the myth of King Arthur and the Sword in the Stone. Plot The movie opens with a raging desert battle between the cities of Basra and Baghdad, during which Basran, the father of Harun (Rock Hudson), is fatally wounded. Before he dies, he gives his son a medallion he has pulled from his killer's neck, and urges him to somehow end the senseless killings. Harun rides to Baghdad, where he meets the beautiful Khairuzan (Piper Laurie), who tries to sell clothes to shopkeeper Barcus (Steven Geray). He bargains with Barcus that for 10 dinars, he can pick any item in the shop. Under a pile of rags, he finds a golden sword that seems to somehow call him. Khairuzan ignites a riot when she defends the citizens of Basra. Barcus watches in awe as Harun cuts solid metal in half with his golden sword. As soon as soldiers appear and spirit Khairuzan away, the fighting stops, and Harun finds a medallion on the ground identical to the one his father gave him. Barcus discovers that the sword will cut through iron only when Harun wields it. He warns Harun to be careful until they can translate the inscriptions on its blade and discover all its powers. Meanwhile, in the palace, sinister Vizier Jafar (George Macready) urges Badgad's Caliph to fight Basra, but the Caliph refuses. Khairuzan, who is in fact the princess, is soon brought in by her guard, Jafar's dim-witted son Hadi (Gene Evans). Jafar convinces the Caliph that Khairuzan's headstrong ways may be tamed by marriage to his son, then later plots with Hadi to undermine the Caliph by inciting more battles against Basra. When Khairuzan learns of the arranged marriage, she escapes again and disguises herself as a boy. Harun is waiting outside for an audience with Jafar, and when the guards spot Khairuzan, she steals Harun's horse. She is finally caught by both Hadi and Harun, who begin a fight which Harun wins. He discovers that he is actually invincible while wielding the golden sword. Khairuzan claims to be a boy slave and Harun brings her to the city, where she eavesdrops as Barcus reveals that the sword's first inscription promises that whoever unsheathes the sword will gain the throne. Later, Harun, realizing that Khairuzan is a girl, protects her when a guard questions them, and they are both thrown to the dungeon, where they fall in love and kiss. After a minor quarrel, Khairuzan makes herself known to the guards and moves back to her harem. Knowing of the sword's magical powers, she declares that only the winner of a tournament may claim her hand. She names Harun as her guard, and although he is infuriated to discover she is a princess and he her servant, he later watches admiringly as she is very kind to the poor townspeople. Meanwhile, Khairuzan's handmaiden, Bakhamra (Kathleen Hughes), informs Hadi about the magic sword, and he and his father steal it by creating a replica and then drugging Harun in order to switch the two. Khairuzan wakes Harun from his stupor and later asks him why he has not yet signed up for the tournament. When she disagrees with his response that he is not aristocratic enough to marry her, he kisses her. He then races to Barcus to proclaim his newfound joy, and refuses to listen when Barcus warns him that the second inscription counsels that the bearer's true reward will arrive in a grave of stone. At the tournament, Hadi tampers with Harun's saddle. Quickly, all but Hadi and Harun are eliminated from the contest, and Hadi finally wins by throwing Harun from his saddle. Harun realizes his sword was switched and suspects Khairuzan. He breaks into the palace and finds Bakhamra, who has just been jilted by Hadi and so reveals his scheme to Harun. Harun locates Hadi just as he is about to bring his unwilling bride to bed, and fights with him. He is captured by Hadi's guards and brought before Jafar. Bakhamra and the Caliph overhear the vizier plan to kill them and blame Harun. When the Caliph orders Jafar arrested, the vizier brings out his medallion, which is the same as the one Harun carries, and tries to kill the Caliph with the magic sword, but it slices into a stone pillar and remains stuck there. The guards kill the Caliph, but Harun and Khairuzan escape by fooling the guards into believing they have died. Jafar and Hadi soon discover that they cannot pull the sword out of the column and call men in from across Bagdad to attempt to pull it out. While Khairuzan gathers the townspeople around her, Harun and Barcus sneak back into the palace. Harun fights with the guards and is almost captured when Khairuzan rouses the people to storm the palace. He grabs the sword from the stone, causing it to collapse on top of Jafar and Hadi. Khairuzan bestows on Harun the title Al-Rhashid (the righteous). Then they kiss.

Early life  Jos√© Alonso was born in the Montserrat section of Buenos Aires, in 1917. The son of a Spanish tailor, he dedicated himself to the same profession, and was first elected as a union delegate of the tailors in 1938. Alonso initially supported socialism and Alfredo Palacios, but balked from the Socialist Party of Argentina in his support for the populist Colonel Juan Per√≥n, Secretary of Labor of Pedro Pablo Ram√≠rez' military government in power since June 4, 1943. On March 23, 1943, Alonso created the SOIVA (Sindicato de la Industria del Vestido de la Capital Federal, Trade-Union of Clothing Industry of Capital Federal) textile trade- union to counter the influence of the communist Federaci√≥n Obrera del Vestido (FOV, Workers' Federation of Clothing). Supported by Per√≥n, the SOIVA soon became one of the strongest trade-unions of Argentina. Again, in 1945 and also with support of the military junta, Alonso founded the FONIVA (Federaci√≥n Obrera Nacional de la Industria del Vestido) national federation, and became its vice-secretary.  During the Peronist government  Jos√© Alonso, elected secretary of the SOIVA in 1946, became part of the Confederal Central Committee of the CGT trade union. He travelled abroad, being delegate of Argentine workers' in several conferences of the International Labour Organization (ILO) and took part in the formation of the ATLAS (Agrupaci√≥n de Trabajadores Latinoamericanos Sindicalistas, a Latin American trade-union confederation) in 1952. He married at that time Mar√≠a Luisa Pinella, another trade-unionist who had earned Eva Per√≥n's trust. Jos√© Alonso then participated, along with other unionist leaders, as representative of the CGT, to the First National Congress of Philosophy, in Mendoza (March‚ÄìApril 1949), which contributed to set the bases of the Peronist movement. He also collaborated to the creation of the FATRE (Federaci√≥n Argentina de Trabajadores Rurales y Estibadores) and was a member of the directorship of the Fundaci√≥n Eva Per√≥n from 1952 to 1955, as well as secretary of the directorship of the EPASA, which published La Prensa and other newspapers. Alonso was elected deputy of the Capital Federal from 1952 to 1955. He participated to the elaboration of the law on collective bargaining and the law on the pay of free day for workers working at home.  Revoluci√≥n Libertadora  Following the 1955 Revoluci√≥n Libertadora, a military coup which ousted Per√≥n, Alonso was detained, before being unexpectedly released on 25 June 1956. Apparently that was an error, and the junta tried to capture him again, but Alonso managed to join Per√≥n in his Venezuelan exile. He then participated to the negotiations between Per√≥n and Rogelio Julio Frigerio, who represented presidential candidate Arturo Frondizi of the UCRI. These negotiations resulted in Per√≥n's decisive endorsement of Frondizi in the 1958 presidential elections. Alonso returned to Argentina in 1957, and was again detained, for several months, following the strike in the Frigor√≠fico Nacional Lisandro de la Torre. He then tried to re-organize his former group of textile workers, as the trade-union had been put under federal receivership by the dictatorship. Frondizi would win the February 1958 elections, and would gradually restore the CGT to its former, independent status. In March 1960, he was again elected as secretary general, and participated in the CGT de la Resistencia, headed by the steelworker Armando Cabo (the father of Dardo Cabo, who would join the Montoneros). He authorized his union's adhesion to the 62 Organizaciones, a Peronist trade-union association created following the 1957 CGT Congress.  General Secretary of the CGT  Alonso became a member of the \\"Commission of the 20\\", a unionist organization which gathered Peronists and independents, and headed the CGT following its legalization by Frondizi's government on February 28, 1961. Until 1963, the CGT was not completely institutionally normalized. President Jos√© Mar√≠a Guido authorized the CGT Normalization Congress in 1963. One hundred trade unions participated, and because the 62 Organizations supported Jos√© Alonso as candidate for Secretary General of the CGT, he was thus elected on February 1, 1963. Alonso supported at first political reforms issued by Arturo Illia's new president (1963-1966), such as the cancelling of oil contracts subscribed by Frondizi. But on December 4, 1963, he presented a 15 points petition list, which requested increased wages, rupture with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), active participation of workers' in the state firms and the elimination of unemployment. A few days later, he started his speech in La Boca by declaring: \\"Viva 1964 because it is the year in which Per√≥n will return to the country.\\" He then headed the CGT's struggle against Illia's policies (Plan de Acci√≥n), between March 1964 and July 1965. On 21 May 1964, around 80 factories of the Greater Buenos Aires were occupied, and 6 other strikes were organized under the CGT's leadership, followed by 3,900,000 workers and 11,000 working sites. The plan, initially supported by independents among the CGT, then lead to the resignation of the graphist and vice-secretary general of the CGT, H√©ctor Riego Ribas, who opposed himself to the mobilization in favor of Per√≥n's return.  Operativo Retorno and the break with Vandor  In December 1964, Alonso participated in the organization of Operativo Retorno (Operation Return), aimed at bringing back Per√≥n from exile. The Operation was defeated however by the incumbent government. In 1965, he was reelected as a representative of the CGT, and began to break with the steelworker leader, Augusto Vandor, who headed the 62 Organizations and wanted more independence from Per√≥n's directives, launching the famous the mot d'ordre \\"A Peronism without Per√≥n\\". Along with Lorenzo Pepe, Andr√©s Framini and Amado Olmos, he established the anti-Vandor \\"62 Organizations Standing with Per√≥n\\". When Mar√≠a Estela Mart√≠nez, Per√≥n's third wife, traveled to Argentina to head the opposition to Vandor, Alonso became her main counselor. Meanwhile, the government and the military supported internal struggles among the CGT, particularly following Labor Minister Rubens San Sebasti√°n's implementation of a \\"divide and conquer\\" policy, around 1966. Despite open support from Per√≥n and his wife, Jos√© Alonso lost his functions at the CGT on 2 February 1966, under pressure from the Vandoristas, and was replaced by Fernando Donaires. The CGT General Congress then named as general secretary, Francisco Prado, a man from the Light and Power Workers' (Luz y Fuerza) trade-union - allies of Vandor. Alonso then chose a new turn. Using his effective diplomatic relationship with the Roman Catholic Church in Argentina and the Armed Forces, he supported a coup d'√âtat against Arturo Illia's elected government, and managed to reach an agreement with Vandor, both unified in common criticisms of liberal democracy.He declared, in 1965: \\"El pa√≠s comienza a salir de la crisis para entrar al caos. Este corsette de la constituci√≥n ahoga al pa√≠s y lo desgarra\\"  Ongan√≠a's dictatorship  Following Juan Carlos Ongan√≠a's military coup of June 28, 1966, Alonso declared: \\"We congratulate ourselves in having witnessed the fall of the last bourgeois liberal government, because it will never be able to establish itself here again.\\".Spanish: \\"nos congratulamos de haber asistido a la ca√≠da del √∫ltimo gobierno liberal burgu√©s, porque jam√°s podr√° volver implantarse nada as√≠\\" The main trade unionist leaders, Vandor, Prado, Light and Power workers' leader Juan Jos√© Taccone, and Alonso attended the inaugural of the new de facto President Ongan√≠a. Along with Rogelio Coria, Jos√© Alonso participated to the Nueva Corriente de Opini√≥n, which, headed by Taccone, supported a \\"participationist\\" or \\"collaborationist\\" attitude toward the military regime. A new tendency, opposed to the latter, formed in the workers' movement, headed by Amado Olmos, Raimundo Ongaro, Julio Guill√°n, Jorge Di Pasquale, Ricardo De Luca, Atilio Santill√°n, and Agust√≠n Tosco. However, trade unionists, and in particular Jos√© Alonso, began to oppose themselves to Ongan√≠a's dictatorship following Per√≥n 's public condemnation of the military regime in September 1966. On November 21, 1966, Alonso stated that the military's policies were handing out the country to foreign hands. The break with the military junta became definitive with the nomination of the orthodox liberal Adalbert Krieger Vasena to the Economic and Labor Ministry, in December 1966. The government began to detain trade unionists. Francisco Prado resigned from his functions as CGT general secretary in May 1967, and called a Normalization Congress at the end of March 1968. The radical tendency, opposed to collaboration with the military, won the elections, and the print workers' leader, Raimundo Ongaro, was elected general secretary. Since the \\"participationists\\" (Vander, Alonso, etc.) retained control of the CGT's headquarters, Ongaro headed a split, leading to the creation of the CGT de los Argentinos. In this context, the Cordobazo riots of 1969 erupted, followed by the assassination of Vandor on June 30, 1969. Ongaro's CGT de los Argentinos was outlawed, while the CGT itself was temporarily suspended. On July 4, 1970, the right-wing unionist and steelworker Jos√© Ignacio Rucci was elected general secretary of the CGT.  Assassination  Alonso was assassinated on August 27, 1970 by Montoneros militants, although the crime has never been solved. He was buried in La Chacarita Cemetery.

She returned to New York City 15 months later after spending 12 months frozen in the ice pack of Marguerite Bay on the Palmer Peninsula. She was struck from the Navy List December 1948 and was sold by the Navy 8 February 1949.

The district is centered on the junction of Old Warren and Pearse Roads, the former being a major stage route between Fall River and Providence, Rhode Island, and was for many years associated with the locally prominent Luther Family. Luther's Corner was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history Luther's Corner is located in western Swansea, just southwest of the intersection of United States Route 6 and Interstate 195. Old Warren Road, the east-west route through the junction, was originally a major through street, but has now been truncated by that highway interchange. The corner developed as a stage coach stop in the early 19th century, providing services to passing travelers, and developed as the major economic center of Swansea in the first half of the 19th century. Three of the four principal structures in the district are associated with the locally prominent Luther family, including the Luther Store (c. 1815-18, now a local history museum), the James Luther Tavern (c. 1800), and the John Brown-Luther House (c. 1811). The fourth building is the Seth Eddy House and Store, built in 1871, and now strictly residential in use. All four buildings are 2-1/2 story wood frame structures. Luther's Store was one of the most successful mercantile businesses in Swansea in the mid-19th century, also housing the local post office and library. After it closed in 1870 (the building converted to just a residence), the Eddy Store replaced it, but the area was declining in importance due in part to increased use of the railroad, which ran further south. The town green, originally located at the center of the road junction and housing a bandstand, was removed in 1901 to make way for a streetcar line.

Its focal point is Buttonwood Park, a municipal park planned by Charles Eliot in the 1890s, and part of its surrounding neighborhood. The neighborhood was developed in the first decades of the 20th century as a complement to the park, and contains a fine selection of Colonial Revival and Craftsman style houses. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. Description and history Buttonwood Park is a roughly L-shaped public park located west of downtown New Bedford. The northernmost section of the park is wooded, and is separated from the rest of the park by a pond. The southern edge of the pond is dammed, and a road, part of the park's circulation, passes east-west across the dam. The southwestern part of the park is occupied by Buttonwood Park Zoo, and the southeastern portion is a combination of an open lawn (for passive recreation) and formal athletic facilities. The park's state represents a partial implementation and subsequent modification to a master plan drafted by Charles Eliot in the 1890s. The park is bounded by four major local roadways: Brownell Avenue on the west, Kempton Street to the north, Rockdale Avenue to the west, and Hawthorne Street to the south. The northeastern portion of this quadrangle is subdivided into streets of residential housing, and the opposite sides of the bounding streets are also generally lined with housing. These are typically one or two-family wood-frame buildings, built in styles popular in the early 20th century. The most commonly found styles are the Craftsman (particularly in the Bungalow variant) and the Colonial Revival, although there are some clusters of Queen Anne Victorians. Lot sizes are small, and the houses are generally set back similar distances from the street. There is one church, and a few modern commercial intrusions.

It was established in 1958 and has since been a prominent member of UNB's residence community. The house holds many traditions such as their Club Med beach party, their house dance to the song \\"Shout\\" by the Isley Brothers, and their house cheer. Aitken House is the only residence at UNB to have their own alumni association, and has recently celebrated their 55th anniversary, which saw Aitken brothers from 1958-2013 attend. History Built in 1958 with funding provided by Maxwell Aitken A.K.A. Lord Beaverbrook, Aitken house was the second residence to be built on the UNB Fredericton campus. In the winter of 2007, UNB Residential Life & Conferencing Services decided that due to a lack of enrollment in residence, they would close Aitken House and attempt to sell it to the University to be turned into an academic building. Although the residence community had seen many buildings come and go throughout its lifetime, the residents and alumni of Aitken House were not ready to let it go without a fight. The majority of the residence community showed their support to keep Aitken House alive through painting red A's in their windows, flying banners, and attending meetings. There were also those who supported ResLife's position and the campus newspaper's letters to the editor section was filled with controversy every week. Throughout the remainder of that academic year, the supporters of Aitken appealed at many meetings to stop the sale of the house. But to their dismay they were unable to stop it along the way. It progressed all the way through to the UNB Board of Governors (BOG) meeting, a step that is usually just a formality. Traditionally only the members of the BOG are allowed to be present during a meeting but they allowed the house to make a presentation as to why the residence building should be spared. As the members of the BOG entered the Wu Center for their meeting, they were greeted by Aitken House residents and supporters mainly from other residences at UNB, all lined up beside each entrance. The meeting went on for hours and everyone went to wait for the final word back at Aitken House. For the first time in UNB BOG's history, a decision was overturned and the House was saved. Sports Aitken House always has a good showing at each sporting event, and often is number one among the other UNB residences. Aitken House competes in many of UNB's intramural athletics. Every year the house is found at such sporting events as: Outdoor & Indoor Soccer, Softball & Co-Rec Softball, Flag football, Volleyball & Co-Rec Volleyball, Basketball, Water Polo, Ball Hockey & Ice Hockey, Co-Rec Ultimate Frisbee, and Broom Ball. Traditions Aitken House is built on a number of traditions, that are passed down, year after year; the men of Aitken uphold a number of these traditions with pride and passion. Some of the traditions include: *Club Med - 22 tons of sand is passed, bucket by bucket, into the basement, where a gigantic beach party takes place, every November. *Aitken Week - One week in January where the house celebrates its history, brotherhood, and alumni. *Shout - Aitken's song of choice. A special dance accompanies this tune, each time it is played. *House Cheer - Performed to the Mickey Mouse theme song, all residents chant this with pride. *Blood Donor Clinics on Campus - Aitken residents volunteer at every blood donor clinic on campus. *Car Smash - Teamed up with AIDS NB, the house charity, a car is donated, covered in spray-painted stigmas, then smashed to pieces by way of auction. The event began in 2011, and has already grown to be strong tradition.

The house, built in stages between about 1710 and 1825, provides a window into architectural trends of 18th- century southern Massachusetts. The house is operated as a museum by the Westport Historical, and is open on some Saturdays between June and October. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Description and history The Handy House is located in central Westport, at the northwest corner of Hixbridge and Drift Roads, near the western bank of the East Branch Westport River. Both roads are historically old, with the east-west Drift Road based on a former Indian trail. The house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof and clapboarded exterior. It has an eight-bay front facade, with entrances in the second and fifth bays from the left. Both are framed by Federal style surrounds, with pilasters, four-light transom windows, and gabled pediments. The house was probably built in three stages, beginning c. 1710. The oldest portion consists of the rightmost three bays, and probably formed a typical early Rhode Island stone ender. The central two bays were added between 1730 and 1750, giving the house a traditional Georgian five-bay facade with center entry. In 1825, the left three bays were added, and the exterior was given its present Federal styling. The building interior has preserved elements from all three periods of constructions, despite restylings during the 18th and 19th centuries. The house is owned by the Westport Historical Society and operated as a historic house museum. It is mostly unfurnished, and visitors are able to examine the 18th and 19th-century building techniques and decorative elements.

The show format consists of sketches, commercial and song parodies and original comedy songs, and lasts roughly an hour and ten minutes. Founded by Sean Keenan and A. Blaine Miller, two original members of Charlotte stalwart comedy group The Perch, Robot Johnson is made up of Perch alumni along with local actors and comedians. Relying on local humor and pushing the envelope on racial, sexual and political issues, Robot Johnson claims to provide \\"good humor by bad people.\\" History The initial concept for The Robot Johnson Show came out of a series of conversations Keenan had with Douglas Young, Director of Theatrical Programming of the North Carolina Blumenthal Performing Arts Center, of which Spirit Square is a part. Given the previous success of The Perch (which had folded in 2006 after eleven years of performing in Charlotte) and Keenan's national notoriety as the voice and puppeteer of MTV2 character The Talking Baby, Young thought that the time was right to start a new sketch comedy troupe in the city. Although initially reluctant to get involved, Keenan eventually agreed, calling Miller to gauge interest in the foundation of a new group.http://www.charlotte.com/444/story/625586.html The Robot Johnson Show debuted in the Charlotte Comedy Theatre on December 7, 2007, with its first show including favorites like \\"Quay Rogers: Surrogate Black Guy,\\" \\"Of Maple Leaves and Human Suffering,\\" and \\"The Incredibly Sad Indian.\\" Present Currently, Robot Johnson is performing at Wine Up in Charlotte, NC and is a touring company across both North and South Carolina. Cast The current cast and writing staff of The Robot Johnson Show is as follows: *Sean Keenan, producer and co-founder *Candice Cortinas, associate producer *Tiffany Apple, performer *David Golden, writer/performer *Graham Odom, writer/performer *Noah Lemmons, writer/performer *Zaq Rogers, performer *Meghan Lowther, writer/performer *Brandon Ballard, writer/performer *Luci Wilson, performer *Drew Aronica, performer/writer *Field Canty, performer *Ryan Stamey, performer *Tania Kelly, writer/performer * Josh Lanier, writer * Andy Rogers, writer Recurring characters *Gordon, the Marginalized Redneck (Sean Keenan) *Becca Norwood, Channel 5 reporter (Tiffany Apple) *Paula and Skalene, the \\"Double Wide\\" girls (Tiffany Apple and Luci Wilson) *Gene Shalit (Brandon Ballard) *The Talking Baby (Sean Keenan) *Disembodied Voice (Graham Odom) *Gene and Monty, two '40s-era movie execs (David Golden and Zaq Rogers) *The Guardian Pancake (Sean Keenan) *Kelly Hornsby (Luci Wilson) *Dr. A**hole (Zaq Rogers) *Drs. Howell, Utley, Cornwallis, and Patricks, the redneck NASA rocket scientists (Luci Wilson, David Golden, Tiffany Apple, and Graham Odom) *Shelby Gerkin (Meghan Lowther) The Talking Baby The Talking Baby is described by creator Sean Keenan as an \\"R-rated puppet show,\\" though the baby in question is not actually a puppet but rather an anatomically correct baby doll. During the Talking Baby segments, audience members are able to see Keenan's hand as he operates the baby, changing its hand positions and turning its head. The ostensible function of Talking Baby is to review movies, but the character often goes off on tangents about characters, actors, directors or concepts involved in the movie and quite often has not seen the movies he reviews. The Talking Baby segment is the raunchiest and most profanity-laden of each show, with the Baby promising to \\"clean it up\\" for children and the elderly before descending into a tirade of obscenity. One of the most popular sketches in the show, Talking Baby was eventually made the spokesman for MTV2 in the early 2000s.Charlotte Magazine - CharlotteMagazine.com - Conversation with Sean Keenan The sketch typically starts out with Disembodied Voice paraphrasing a pop song to introduce the baby (one segment featured Disembodied Voice singing the entire first verse to \\"More Than Words\\" by Extreme) before introducing the first film to be reviewed. Partnerships and media appearances At their July 26 shows, Robot Johnson filmed a national 30-minute pilot.Robot Johnson  Press Releases As of February 2009, the pilot is in post-production and there are plans to shop it to two major networks as well as smaller cable stations. Robot Johnson recently launched its own YouTube channel and plans are in the works for a national tour as well as a comedy album.http://www.charlotte.com/663/story/672730.html In September 2008, the troupe partnered with Collaborative Arts Theatre to produce SITCOMS LIVE, which featured three weeks of three separate sitcoms from the latter half of the twentieth century, including episodes of \\"Three's Company,\\" \\"The Facts of Life,\\" and \\"Married...With Children.\\" Robot Johnson performed the commercial breaks for each sitcom, along with a new hour-long sketch comedy show after each performance.

He was prominent in the years immediately after the First World War, where he served as a cabinet minister but was subsequently marginalised, and became a critic of the new regime. Early years Rƒ±za Nur in the 1920s After graduating from the Military Medical School in 1901 Rƒ±za Nur went on to work as a surgeon at G√ºlhane Military Hospital before returning to the Military Medical School as an academic in 1907.Profile on Find a Grave Before this, an early posting had seen him serve on the border with Bulgaria where his job was to check if imported flour was contaminated with killer germs, after the Sultan had claimed this to be the case. The somewhat foolish nature of the work, as well as the refusal of his superiors to supply Rƒ±za with a microscope and other basic scientific tools, helped to convince him that Abdul Hamid II's rule was backward, corrupt and leading Turkey into severe decline.Andrew Mango, Atat√ºrk, London: John Murray, 2004, p. 18 He had also engaged in what he called in his memoir a period of \\"philandering,\\" during which he contracted gonorrhea twice, experiences that, along with his medical training, informed his 1907 book Protection from Venereal Diseases. He entered politics following the adoption of a constitutional monarchy but was imprisoned and later exiled for coming into conflict with the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) administration, remaining a dissenting voice from abroad. Feeling that Turkey was too reliant on Germany but accepting that the country needed a close relationship with a bigger power to prosper he toyed with the idea of a United States mandate in Turkey in the immediate aftermath of World War I.Mango, Atat√ºrk, p. 246 In Government Returning to Turkey in 1919 he was a founder member of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey and was appointed Minister of National Education in 1920 and Minister of Health and Public Assistance in 1921, as well as serving as the envoy at the 1921 Treaty of Moscow and the Conference of Lausanne. For Kemal Atat√ºrk, Rƒ±za was an important appointment as his presence in government, along with that of Ahmet Ferit, lent weight to Atat√ºrk's claims to being a uniting force, as both men had been opponents of the CUP which provided most government ministers.Mango, Atat√ºrk, pp. 323‚Äì4 During the negotiations of the Treaty of Lausanne Rƒ±za was sent as assistant to the head of the Turkish delegation ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º.Mango, Atat√ºrk, p. 357 He was in the subcommittee responsible for minority issues and he defended the view that a Muslim minority would not be acceptable for Turkey. He drew a comparison between the Kizilbash and the Muslims, which he claimed are both ethnic Turks. He opposed the inclusion of Kurds, Bosniaks or Circassians as minorities in any agreement reached at Lausanne. It was he who proposed the motions recognizing the Grand National Assembly as the legitimate government of Turkey, the end of the monarchy but the continuing control of the Caliphate by the Turkish government.Mango, Atat√ºrk, pp. 363‚Äì4 However whilst at Lausanne he also came to blows with the former Prime Minister of Greece Eleftherios Venizelos over the issue of the Pontic Greeks. Indeed what the Allies saw as Rƒ±za's intransigence over both this issue and that of the Armenians led to a Yugoslavian delegate claiming that Rƒ±za was \\"beginning to show the cloven hoof\\". Rƒ±za Nur had negative views of Albanians as being inclined to banditry and other vices which formed his view to press for their exclusion from the population exchange Between Greece and Turkey (1923) to which Greece agreed.. Nur expressed displeasure that Albanians had arrived as Turks from Greece contravening the exchange agreement and that they were resettled in areas such as Kartal, Pendik and Erenk√∂y, west of ƒ∞zmit considered to be high quality lands and in Ankara.. Nur also accused ƒ∞zmir governor Abd√ºlhalik Renda of encouraging his Albanian compatriots (refugees and immigrants) to resettle from other Anatolian regions to ƒ∞zmir, claims that Renda denied.. Nur also had negative views of Circassians in Turkey and along with the Albanians viewed them as a threat to the Turkish state due to developing rival nationalisms.. Later years Turkish delegation after having signed the Treaty of Lausanne. The delegation was led by ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º (in the middle) and Rƒ±za Nur (on the left wearing the top hat) Following the formation of the Turkish Republic, Rƒ±za Nur fell out of favour and left Turkey in 1926 after the attempt on the life of Atat√ºrk at Izmir. Rƒ±za condemned the executions of Mehmet Cavit Bey and the other alleged assassination conspirators arguing that, whilst he personally disliked the men who had been his own political opponents, he felt that they had not been involved in the plot and so were unjustly killed.Mango, Atat√ºrk, p. 452 Embittered at the fall-out with his former ally, Rƒ±za also wrote widely about Atat√ºrk's alleged alcoholism.Mango, Atat√ºrk, p. 274 Between 1931 and 1937 published the Revue de Turcologie in French and Turkish language, which founded in Paris, was issued in Alexandria. Returning from exile in Paris and Alexandria after Atat√ºrk's death, in 1942 he published the journal Tanrƒ±daƒüƒ±, which supported Turanism and pan-Turkism. The journal's name refers to the Tien Shan mountain range in Mongolia, a region inhabited by ancient Turkic tribes.Jacob M. Landau, Radical Politics in Modern Turkey, 1974, p.195. Rƒ±za Nur was also a noted writer on a number of topics, with his most well-known work being a history of Turkey in 14 volumes.Sinop profile He died at the age of 63 and was buried at the Merkezefendi Cemetery, Istanbul.

The district also includes one of the major shopping malls in north-western Milan. It is crossed by the Circonvallazione ring road. Portello is adjacent to the new CityLife district. History Portello was one of the major urban requalification process in Milan, as the former Alfa Romeo area (385,000 m¬≤) is now being restructured. The project includes a major parkRequalification projects for Portello (in Italian) called Parco VittoriaParco Vittoria (in Italian) and what will become the largest plaza in MilanPortello, la Milano dei grandi spazi (in Italian) (20,000 m¬≤),Al Portello la piazza pi√π grande di Milano (in Italian) as well as commercial, service and housing infrastructures. The name of the district comes from the \\"Strada del Portello\\" (Portello road), an ancient rural road that used to connect Milan to Rho, and that was later replaced by the new Strada del Sempione (\\"Simplon Road\\") leading to the Simplon Pass; the old Portello road is now known as \\"Via Traiano\\". In turn, the road was named after the Portello city gate, that was part of the city walls and that was located in the surroundings of the modern Cadorna railway station. Parco Vittoria The design of Parco Vittoria, by architects Charles Jencks and Andreas Kipar, includes several unusual elements, and it is based on the general theme of time. It will comprise a large round lake, with a strip-shaped promontory that will allow pedestrians to walk to the center of the lake itself. A helix shaped hill (called \\"The Spiral of Time\\") will provide a panoramic view of the city; an artistic representation of the double DNA helix will be placed on top of the hill. Both the lake and the hill will be part of a park section called \\"Time Garden\\", partitioned into three areas dedicated to prehistory, history and present times.

Thomas was the son of John Twyne (c.1500-1581) of Bullington, Hampshire, himself a translator, schoolmaster, noted collector of antiquarian manuscripts and author of the Commentary De Rebus Albionicis (London, 1590). Tywne's son, Brian Twyne, became the first Keeper of the Archives of the University of Oxford. Thomas was a native of Canterbury and was educated at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. He acted in the Richard Edwardes version of Palamon and Arcite, put on before Elizabeth I at Oxford in 1566, on which occasion the stage collapsed, killing and injuring a number of people.

Biography Louis Vincent Aronson was an American inventor, industrialist and philanthropist who is best remembered as the inventor of Ronson lighters. \\"He was a son of Simon and Jennie Aronson, who were natives of Prussia. He was born December 25, 1869, in New York City, and there his boyhood was spent.\\" ‚ÄúAs a Christmas present,‚Äù he said in later years, ‚ÄúI always felt I ought to qualify by making the world happier. If I have done so, even in the slightest degree, I am so much the happier myself because I had the luck to be born on Christmas Day. My parents used to tell me that a Christmas Child should carry the Christmas spirit with him all the year, no matter what his religious faith might be.\\" Early life and education Aronson was an exceptionally gifted young man who graduated from public school at the age of 12 before entering a New York Technical School specializing in metallurgy, practical metal working and mechanical drawing. At the same time, he set up a laboratory in the basement of his parents' home where he experimented with plating processes and turned out money-making items while he devised ways of metalizing common items, in a durable finish of matte gold, including flowers, butterflies, animal claws and baby shoes. Aronson demonstrated a natural ability for designing which was honed at the technical school and served him well throughout his life. He excelled and completed the School‚Äôs four year academic program in three years. When he graduated in 1886, at the age of 16, he was qualified as an Expert Metallurgist, Draftsman and Designer, he also had a high level knowledge of Chemistry. He returned to the school five years later as an instructor in metallurgy for several years before devoting all his time to his own company. When he was 24 years old, he sold the rights to a commercially valuable metal plating process according to Urban Cummings book Ronson, The Worlds Greatest Lighters, Wick Lighters 1913‚Äì2000. While retaining full use of his invention, young Aronson sold the patent rights for $5000 and used the proceeds to open his own company named the Art Metal Works. Career Louis V. Aronson gained public recognition when he won an award in 1893 from the Belgian government for the creation of the first non-toxic match, and young businessman Aronson received 50,000 Francs, equaling $10,000 in U.S. dollars. In 1897 he received a U.S. patent (592,227) for a match design (called the Wind-match) that would light in windy conditions or when wet. He continued working on his match designs including inventing the ‚ÄúBirds Eye‚Äù or ‚ÄúKitchen‚Äù match that had a dual-tip design in 1903; this was an important safety improvement because friction matches of the day would sometimes light accidentally especially when stepped on or while in one‚Äôs pocket. He realized that placing a small friction ignition chemical on the tip instead of the entire match-head greatly limited accidental ignition. This style of match is still in use today. Aronson continued his research on all-weather matches finally receiving U.S. patent (1,287,819) in 1918, for a match that was praised by soldiers who were fighting in mud-filled trenches during World War I. His proficiency with matches led to a U.S. patent (1,295,952) for Bomb fuses also used in World War I, which he donated to the U.S. Government for the duration of the war, later earning his company the prestigious Distinguished Service Certificate from President Woodrow Wilson and the War Department. Through his research on matches, he sought to create and refine igniting devices that were efficient, safe and commercially viable. By the year 1910 he received his first patent for a pocket lighter (U.S. Pat. 965,149). His pocket lighter used flint material which contained a mixture of cerium and iron according to the patent. His design was a simple device that created a shower of sparks with the press of a finger - but there was no sustainable flame. Based on the patent dates, this device preceded the Pist-O- Liter (U.S. Pat. 966,153) which he successfully produced that year, but likewise, it only produced sparks. Within three years he received a patent titled Pyrophorous Lighter, (U.S. Pat. 1,084,386) which we now appreciate as the Paragon striker lighter, a simple device capable of producing and sustaining a flame by means of a steel-tipped wand fitted with a cloth-wick saturated in petroleum ether also known as Benzine or Naphtha. The following year, 1914, he was granted a design patent for the well known Bulldog striker lighter (Des. Pat. D 45,407) which utilized the same principles as the Paragon, and soon became a very popular table lighter. Aronson‚Äôs earlier efforts to produce igniting devices led him to invent many other useful and profitable items too. His ongoing experiments sparked ideas for other successful inventions like safe children‚Äôs toys including sparking guns, spinning tops & pinwheels and a series of hand held toys with sparking eyes called Archie(s). His inventions were ingenious in that they were appealing to children and safe for them to enjoy. He dedicated much of his time to causes that benefited children and the under-privileged in society. Before long the company was producing a variety of high quality lamps, book ends, statues and other decorative items, prized today for their detail in the collector marketplace. In 1913 Louis Aronson applied for a patent for a Liter (lighter), which was approved along with others in years to come. In 1926 he released a new \\"automatic operation\\" Banjo lighter, which offered both ignition and extinguishment in a single push. It was a great success, demand shortly exceeding supply, spurring Aronson to patent it and design other products around the invention, which were marketed under the Ronson brand name. With the success of the Art Metal Works and Ronson lighters, Aronson went on to become a Newark political and civic leader. He ran for Newark mayor in 1912, was a longtime treasurer of Essex County, New Jersey, Republicans, and became a bank executive. In time, Aronson's firm became the largest concern of its kind in the world. Personal life Aronson's first wife, Gertrude Deutsch Aronson, died in 1934. He remarried in 1935, to stock-company actress Mabel Brownell. Death Louis V.Aronson died on November 2, 1940 in Long Branch, New Jersey.

After 1788, the religious order of Saint Eligius (known as L√≥ios, in Portuguese) built a convent on the south side of the square that replaced the medieval wall; the imposing Neoclassical fa√ßade of the convent, nowadays known as the Cardosas Palace (Pal√°cio das Cardosas) is the oldest extant building of the square, dominating the south side of the square for over 200 years. During the 19th century, several factors increased the importance of the square. The municipality moved to a building on the north side of the square after 1819, and towards the end of the century facilities like the D. Lu√≠s Bridge (1887) and S√£o Bento Train Station (1896) were opened nearby. Liberdade Square was a political, economical and social centre for Porto. In 1866 a monument dedicated to King Peter IV, a monarch closely linked to Porto, was inaugurated in the middle of the square. The monument, by French sculptor Anatole Calmels, consists of a statue of Peter IV riding a horse and holding the Constitution that he had fought to protect during the Liberal Wars. The appearance of the square was much altered after 1916, when the municipality building was demolished and the Avenida dos Aliados, a modern boulevard, was built to the north of the square. The buildings around Liberdade Square and the avenues are occupied by banks, hotels, restaurants and offices. It is an important tourist attraction of the city.

He was also Daugherty's roommate at Washington, D.C.'s Wardman Park Hotel.Jess Smith entry at ohiohistorycentral.org Daugherty's wife had remained behind in Columbus because of illness; Smith was divorced. Smith's activities (it's said he sold bonded liquor to bootleggers, and was associated with a house at 1625 K Street, later to become notorious as the Little Green House on K Street) became an embarrassment to Harding and Daugherty as the Teapot Dome scandal focused increased scrutiny on Harding and his supporters. Before leaving for Alaska, Harding told Daugherty he wanted Smith out of Washington. On May 30, 1923, Smith died of a gunshot wound, and was found with a pistol at his side.https://www.nytimes.com/1923/05/31/archives/daughertys-friend-suicide-in- his-room-jesse-w-smith-shoots-himself.html His death was pronounced a suicide, but Alabama Senator James Thomas Heflin alleged otherwise, first at an investigatory hearing and later from the floor of the United States Senate. \\"Nobody else knew what he [Smith] knew and with him dead there was nobody to tell the story ‚Äì so Jesse Smith was murdered,\\" said Senator Heflin, initially. He followed up two days later, in the Senate, quoting an Alabama bootlegger > You know Secretary Mellon loaned the Republican National Committee > $5,000,000 in 1920. Only $3,000,000 has been repaid.

Morrow & Co., 1998 In fiction Smith is one of four characters (and the only one based on a real person) from whose point of view Gore Vidal's novel of the period, Hollywood, is told. He is portrayed as a business-savvy but weak-willed and sycophantic follower of Harding and Daugherty, and it's speculated that his death might have been a murder used to cover up the Ohio Gang's crimes. Roy Hoopes' novel Our Man in Washington also speculates that Smith might have been murdered as part of a coverup. Smith is played by Ed Jewett in season 3 of the television series Boardwalk Empire. When Harry Daugherty's office comes under investigation for its connections to bootleggers, Smith becomes increasingly paranoid. Daugherty comes to see Smith as a loose end and sends fellow Ohio Gang member, Gaston Means, to kill him. Means plans to kill Smith in his sleep but is unable to surprise him, leading to an awkward confrontation where Smith kills himself. See also * President Warren G.

He was sentenced to 375 years in federal prison. Although he was never brought to trial for murder, he was the principal suspect in two homicides and he remains a suspect in several others. He died of pneumonia at the Federal Medical Center in Butner, North Carolina in early 2011. Background DeBardeleben was born on 20 March 1940 in Little Rock, Arkansas, the second of three children born to James Mitchell DeBardeleben Sr. and Mary Lou Edwards DeBardeleben. The DeBardelebens were a military family who moved frequently. After the Pearl Harbor attack, James DeBardeleben Sr. took a commission as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army, and was posted to Washington, D.C. for the duration of World War II. Mike's younger brother Ralph later became a U.S. Army paratrooper. In 1945, the family moved to Austin, Texas, and James Sr. was shipped out to the South Pacific for nine months. In 1949, the family moved briefly to Kentucky before relocating to Frankfurt, Germany. In 1950, James Sr. was promoted to lieutenant colonel, and the family moved to the Hague in the Netherlands, where James Sr. served for two years as a military adviser for the U.S. Embassy. In 1953, James Sr. retired from the army, and took a federal civil service post in Albany, New York. The marriage between DeBardeleben's parents was unstable and chaotic and both had many extramarital affairs. At one point his parents had considered divorce as a result of these affairs, but ultimately chose to stay married for the sake of the children. DeBardeleben's mother was a sexually promiscuous and emotionally unstable alcoholic, whose behavior could become violent at times. His mother often neglected the children when her husband was away, preferring to spend much of her time at the bars drinking and picking up men. Mike's sister Linda became a caretaker for her younger brothers. It was during this period that DeBardeleben began to develop a deep hatred of his mother, which would eventually crystallize into a hatred of women in general. As a child, DeBardeleben was subjected to considerable abuse and neglect by both his mother and father. His father was a punitive man who was very critical of his children and almost never praised them for their accomplishments. When Debardeleben was younger, his father would punish him by holding his head underwater in a bathtub as well as switching him. According to his siblings, these punishments began before he was old enough to attend school. Even from an early age, Mike was a quiet loner, detached from the other children. According to his own account and that of his sister, he preferred solitary activities and spent a great deal of time drawing and sketching in his room. These sorts of activities became an escape for him and a way to express himself, from which he \\"derived much inner satisfaction\\". In adolescence, DeBardeleben began to exhibit antisocial behavior and aggressiveness toward others. In 1956, at the age of 16, DeBardeleben physically assaulted his mother for the first time. He is also alleged to have threatened his mother at times with a hatchet or a letter opener. On September 8 of that year, he purchased two handguns and ammunition with a friend. Later that month, he was arrested and convicted of his first felony, possessing a concealed firearm. This arrest was the first of many that followed, on sodomy, attempted murder, kidnapping, and other charges. Adult life In the spring of 1957, DeBardeleben was expelled from Peter Schuyler High School, which effectively ended his formal education. In October of that year, he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force and was stationed at the Lackland Air Force Base in Texas. After only a year, he was court-martialed for disorderly behavior and sentenced to two months in the base stockade. In 1958, he was ordered to see a psychiatrist for counseling after he was pronounced AWOL several times. At the age of eighteen, he was discharged from the Air Force and moved in with relatives in Fort Worth, Texas. In 1959, DeBardeleben attempted school again, enrolling in R. L. Paschal High School, but after three months was expelled. In August of that year, he married his first wife, Linda Weir, but three weeks later separated from her. Also that month, he was arrested for attempted robbery with an accomplice, followed two weeks later by his involvement in a string of auto thefts, and was sentenced to five years' probation. In October, he fathered a premature stillborn daughter with an unidentified woman. DeBardeleben later met Charlotte Weber, who was seventeen at the time he started courting her. At the time, DeBardeleben lived at home with his parents, terrorizing his family. Both of his parents feared him and deemed him capable of killing them. Weber recalls how DeBardeleben's family endured violent outbursts in which he \\"lit fires in his room\\" and \\"kicked doors in\\". Nonetheless, Weber described DeBardeleben as a \\"handsome young rebel\\" with whom she was \\"enthralled\\". In March 1960, he impregnated Charlotte and on June 9 the same year, married her. On December 12, 1960, he fathered a daughter, Bethene. Charlotte described him as preoccupied with vanity and being cold and detached but not abusive. Later wives described how DeBardeleben tortured and abused them. DeBardeleben fathered a second child with Charlotte, but was forced by her parents to give the child up for adoption. In August 1961, his 19 year old brother Ralph, who was home on leave from the Army but staying in a motel due to an argument with DeBardeleben, committed suicide in a church parking lot by asphyxiating himself with his car exhaust. He had stated to his sister that he intended not to return when his leave was up; DeBardeleben later blamed his brother's suicide on severe depression arising from rigorous paratrooper training, a girlfriend rejecting him, and, as the underlying cause, the same deprived home environment that he claimed created him. Counterfeiting In the early 1980s, the United States Secret Service believed they had found a geographical pattern to a string of counterfeiting cases, and distributed composite sketches to clerks in stores they projected he would visit in the future based on that pattern. This led to DeBardeleben's arrest. In DeBardeleben's car more counterfeit $20 bills were found, each labeled with the city in which they would be passed. During the search for the equipment with which the notes had been made, photographs were found depicting the rapes and murders of women. FBI profilers speculate that in photographs where his face is seen along with the victim's, he murdered the woman and disposed of her body; whereas in photographs where he is hiding his face, he allowed the victim to live. DeBardeleben represented himself in court, and was convicted of multiple crimes and sentenced to 375 years in federal prison. In personality, DeBardeleben displayed marked schizoid and narcissistic traits, along with the symptoms of psychopathy. He also exemplified all eight of the outdated DSM-III-R criteria for sadistic personality disorder. DeBardeleben was characterized as having a 'Jekyll and Hyde' personality, whose demeanor could shift from affable to extremely cruel. The DSM-IV cites DeBardeleben as an example of both sexual sadism and antisocial personality disorder.  Death  On January 26, 2011, DeBardeleben died of pneumonia at the Federal Medical Center in Butner, North Carolina.

History The original Lanner & District Silver Band was formed in the Cornish village of Lanner in the mid-1890s.Schwartz, Sharron and Parker, Roger Lanner - A Cornish Mining Parish, Tiverton, Devon, Halsgrove. 1998, . The history of the Band is described on pages 270 and 271. However, following large-scale emigration from the mining district it disbanded in 1902. Lanner Band Room The band was reformed in 1965, and in those early days practised in a chicken shed in the garden of Lanner resident Daisy Moyle. Mrs. Moyle later became the band's first 'Life Member'. As the band attracted more members they outgrew the chicken shed and moved to a bandroom at the top of Lanner Hill. From these humble beginnings a strong youth band emerged, and as time went by these young players progressed into the senior band, thus helping to sustain its development. Eventually, even the Lanner Hill Bandroom became too small, and a concerted effort from the players and committee members resulted in the purchase, in 1983, of the old Primitive Methodist chapel on Lanner Moor, which is the present band's headquarters. Current activities Lanner & District Silver band has progressed from its early days in the fourth section of the Cornish and national ratings, and is today one of the finest bands in Cornwall (a county which has around 40 silver bands). It has represented the South West area at the National Finals and won many other contests throughout the south west. In April 2003 the band was crowned West of England 2nd Section Champions. This promoted the band to the 1st Section and gained them qualification to the National Brass Band Championships of Great Britain. The success continued later that year when, at the finals, the band achieved a magnificent 3rd place. Since that time the band has competed successfully in the First Section and will be proud to be competing in the Championship Section as of January 2014. The success continues and the Lanner Band is recognised as one of the most innovative, entertaining and successful bands in Cornwall. In July 2013 the band successfully completed the building of its new Headquarters and recording facility, which can also be used as a community venue. Funded by the generous donation of a grant from the Sita Cornwall Trust, the building was completed with a huge amount of voluntary work by band members and committee. The band plays at the head of the Lanner Carnival parade in July and the Remembrance Day parade in November, which march through the village every year along with Scouting groups, a number of village groups, and decorated floats.

Kelly's Directory of Cheshire, 1914 lists Macefen under Tushingham cum Grindley thus: \\"Macefen (or Maesfen) is a small township in the Whitchurch union, 2 miles south from Malpas station. The Hon. Mrs. Algernon R. Parker, who has a residence here [at on the north side of Bradley Lane], is lady of the manor and sole landowner.\\" It never had its own church but was served by adjacent churches.GenUKI page about Macefen parish The civil parish was abolished in 2015 to form Tushingham-cum-Grindley, Macefen and Bradley and No Man's Heath and District.

The Danish Jewish Museum (), in Copenhagen, Denmark, sits inside the Danish Royal Library‚Äôs old Galley House and exhibits Danish Jewish historical artifacts and art. Designed by architect Daniel Libeskind, the building memorializes the story of Danish Jews who were saved from Nazi persecution by their fellow Danes in October 1943. Construction of the Museum began in March 2003 and the museum opened in June 2004. History At the turn of the seventeenth century, King Christian IV built Denmark's Royal Boat House, which was later renovated in 1906, during the construction of the adjacent Royal Library. In 1985, the Society for Danish Jewish History decided to establish a museum in Copenhagen dedicated to its namesake. It wasn't until the 1990s, however, that the organization met with Daniel Libeskind and the Royal Library site underwent another transformation. The renovation of the Boat House, executed by Fogh & F√∏lner architects, began in July 2002, and construction of the Danish Jewish Museum ended in September 2003. In June 2004, the museum opened. Concept The Museum is the first official museum in Denmark dedicated to a minority or immigrant group. Rather than concentrate on the Holocaust, the museum's board of directors, members of The Society for Danish Jewish History, decided to present the diversity and culture of the Jewish community in Denmark, to highlight the positive and unique aspects of the Jewish story, which dates back to approximately 400 years. Along with diversity, another theme explored in the museum is inclusiveness: the Danes including Jews in everyday society; the Jewish community opening up to the surrounding society; and consequently the museum reaching out to non-Jewish Danes and non-Jewish foreigners The museum's board had to take into consideration the level of knowledge possessed by the target audience. In particular, they had to find a balance between celebrated events, such as the Rescue of the Danish Jews in October 1943, and less familiar ones. Design The entrance area Interior of the Danish Jewish Museum. The space's evolving function influenced Libeskind's design. The museum's layout incorporates a pedestrian walk between the new and old libraries, outdoor summer seating for a caf√©, and intimate conversation spaces at the ground level of the entrance. The whole building is organized as a series of planes, each corresponding to a particular field of religious discourse. Together, the planes, named Exodus, Wilderness, The Giving of the Law, and The Promised Land, carve interior corridors of fractured passageways and slanted floors. These corridors comprise the museum's exhibition spaces and, as they wind, they form the letters for the Hebrew word Mitzvah, meaning ‚Äúgood deed.‚Äù According to the museum's website, the form of the building stands as a commentary on the artifacts and artworks it houses, paralleling how accompanying texts often illuminate different aspects of the Talmud. Libeskind describes the space as a ‚Äúsort of text running within a frame made up of many other surfaces ‚Äì walls, inner spaces, showcases, virtual perspectives.‚Äù Content Most of the items on display come from either the Royal Library's Judaica collection or are on loan from the Jewish Community in Copenhagen, Mosaiske Trossamfund.

It consisted of the daily weekday showing of old films usually between 12:30 and 2:00 P.M; if the film ran two hours or more, it was split into two parts. Atlanta local station WSB-TV, for instance, would show films in this time slot under the umbrella title Armchair Playhouse. Popular titles, such as the 1953 House of Wax, The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms (also 1953), the 1935 Mutiny on the Bounty, the 1949 The Secret Garden, or National Velvet (1944), would often turn up as afternoon movies (years later, in 1978, National Velvet was shown on network television, by CBS). During the Christmas season, such films as Gulliver's Travels (1939), Hansel and Gretel: An Opera Fantasy (1954), or A Christmas Carol (1938) would sometimes be telecast on local stations after the network telecast of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade. These afternoon movie telecasts existed in an age where was no cable TV, home video, or video-on-demand. Viewers either had to watch an old film when it was telecast, or wait for it to be shown at a revival house. WABC-TV in New York City ran The 4:30 Movie weekdays from 1968 to 1981. Other ABC owned-and-operated stations also used the format at different times in the afternoon. Some local stations also telecast morning movies in much the same format; these were often shown from 9:30 A.M. to 11:00 A.M., and, like the afternoon films, would often be split up into two parts. Many obscure B-films turned up as morning movies, though occasionally a \\"big film\\" such as The Miracle of the Bells would be telecast. As more and more films began to be televised by entire networks in prime time, and as more and more soap operas, talk shows, and daily syndicated programming filled the network airwaves and became extremely popular, the daily afternoon movie on TV was gradually phased out on the local affiliates belonging to the three major commercial networks (NBC, CBS and ABC). Ted Turner's WTBS-TV (now Meredith- owned WPCH), on the other hand, showed old films such as the 1960 Little Shop of Horrors and the edited version of Joan of Arc both in the morning and in the afternoon throughout the 1970s, when it was called WTCG. Today, films are often shown locally on commercial stations in the afternoon on weekends (especially since there are now so many more television channels), but none are shown in the afternoon on a weekday on any local TV station.

This society has an approximate population of over 300,000 persons. The Bwa people live in a number of individualized communities. They have no central government, and rely on their community standards. They are most known for their scarification and elaborate plank masks. History In the 18th century, Bwa lands were occupied by the Bamana empire who made the Bwa pay taxes. The places left unconquered were raided by the Bamana, which led to a weakening of the Bwa social and political systems. In the 19th century, the Bamana declined and the area was dominated by the Fulani who raided and enslaved the Bwa and stole their livestock.Roy & Wheelock, p.50 The end of the 19th century brought French mercenaries who used the Fulani to help control the area. The Bwa traditions of storing crops for use in lean years were undermined by the crippling taxation systems of the French and they suffered further from famine from 1911‚Äì1913. The French demanded military recruits from the Bwa and in 1915, the Bwa revolted., starting the Volta-Bani War. This war lasted about a year and ended with the destruction of many Bwa villages. Due to these events, the Bwa turned to their neighboring people, the Nuna. Admiring what they believed to be continuous blessings, the Bwa wanted to adopt some Nuna customs in attempt to please the Nuna God. Obliging, the Nuna taught the Bwa some of their customs and practices. From this, the Bwa purchased the rights to use, wear, and carve wooden masks, their costumes, and the songs and dances that go with them. Regional Identification The Bwa live in central Burkina Faso and south-east Mali, between Mali's Bani River and the Mouhoun River (Black Volta) in Burkina Faso. Their total population is approximately 300,000. The major towns occupied by the Bwa are Hound√©, Boni, Bagassi, Dossi and Pa. Early European explorers to the area called the Bwa \\"Bobo\\", confusing them with their neighbours the Bobo people. Although the two groups share religion and culture, they are ethnically distinct. The confusion led to alternative names for the Bwa including Bobo Oule, or Eastern Bobo. In Jula, Bobo Oule means \\"Red Bobo\\". This distinguishes the Bwa from the Bobo who are called the \\"Black Bobo\\". The White Bobo, Bobo Gbe, are also Bwa. The southern Bwa became known by their neighbours as Nieniegue meaning \\"scarred Bwa\\" as a result of the tradition of scarification of their faces and bodies. This practice is no longer commonplace and so the term is also in decline. Society and politics= Economy = There are three professional castes within the Bwa society: the farmers, the musicians, and the blacksmiths. Farming has been a constant way of life for the Bwa. It is their primary source of income with their most successful crop being cotton. Besides cotton, though, the Bwa are known to harvest certain grains such as millet, rice, sorghum, yams, and peanuts. These crops along with other grains and various fruits are used for both nutritional and medicinal purposes. Music is integral to the Bwa's traditional ceremonies and rituals. While they do use drums, the Bwa are known to craft and play flutes carved from wood. Blacksmiths in the Bwa society work mostly with bronze to craft masks, figures, utensils, and jewelry. These works can be bought and sold, used for personal use, and/or are utilized during rituals. = Politics = Bwa villages are autonomous and they do not recognise any outside political authority. They are led by a council of male elders who make all the major decisions. Culture=Language= The Bwa speak Bwa languages, a closely related group of Gur languages of the Niger‚ÄìCongo family. Some speak Jula (Dioula) for trading and communication with outsiders, and French is also used. =Religion and mythology= The creator deity of the Bwa is known as Wuro, a god who designed the earth with the intention of establishing balance. Wuro was said to be hurt by a human, and in return, he decided to send his eldest son Dwo to act as the communication line between him and the people. Wuro had three sons: Dwo, the god of rebirth, Soxo, the god of the wilderness, and Kwere, the lightning god. Two and his significance is heavily depicted in the Boni Bwa's ceremonial leaf masks. Animism is the main religious belief practiced by the Bwa. In fact, the art work that the Bwa are known for is primarily used for animist practices‚Äîspecifically that of Nuna origin.  Denominations  Nuna practices still hold firm in the Bwa culture. In relation, there is a group called the Cult of Do (or Dwo). They are led by the village's eldest male member, the Labie (also known as the earth priest.) With that being said, they have also adopted both Islam and Christianity as a result of their prior invasions.  Practices  While the Bwa are famous for their masks, it is the purpose behind the pieces that provides the real significance. Using these masks, along with scepters and diverse body adornments, the Bwa will dance and perform these items in representation of different spirits. Those Bwa members who have gone through initiation‚Äîa process of transitioning from a child to an adult member of society‚Äîare grouped together in age grades. During ceremonies, they adorn and praise the masks that are being performed as a group. It is also important to note that these mask performances are not gender specific. Women are very much a part of these events just as much as their male counterparts.  Tools  The Bwa use various divination sculptures and carvings to carry out significant ceremonies and practices. While sculpted figures are a rare art of the Bwa's, the pieces would be used for events such as divination ceremonies, fertility rituals, and offered sacrifices. =Art= Masks = Style = The Bwa masks are usually black and white; additional colors are subject to individual carvers and their styles. Animal depictions are a common attribute of the works. Plank Masks are the most known style of masks for this society. they are vertically shaped and attached to a disk-like base. Decoration is subject to change, but it mostly comes down to zigzags, squares, and circles. The Bwa also make horizontal and heterogenous masks. Heterogenous masks have an ovoid head with round and/or diamond eyes. Sometimes, the artist will choose to add on designs such as crescents or human figures. = Use = Luruya mask with abstract design of geometric patterns, all of which are symbolic; 19th-20th centuries; painted wood and fibre; height: 81.3 cm; Birmingham Museum of Art (USA). This diminutive mask represents Luruya, an ancestor who was small in stature yet revered because he could communicate with animals. The crescent above the a panel with crossed lines, and a red horn above a circular face are characteristic of Bwa plank masks. The lines represent forehead scarification The Bwa are well known for their use of traditional tribal masks. There are several types of masks produced by the Bwa that are used in traditional rituals. In particular the Southern Bwa are known for their tall plank masks, known as nwantantay, and tend to use wood to make their masks. This is a result of their adoption of Nuna religion and their traditions of using wooden masks. The religion associated with wooden masks is focused on the spirit Lanle, whose power is manifested through the wooden masks. Nwantantay can also be made of polychrome by the blacksmiths. Built in horizontal shapes, these masks can represent different animals and have specific designs. For example, a butterfly mask would have concentric circles, while a hawk mask would have a plain white surface. these masks are worn for female entertainment. The northern Bwa use leaf masks more than wooden ones. These leaf masks frequently represent Dwo in religious ceremonies.Roy & Wheelock, p.53 The masks also represent the bush spirits including serpents, monkeys, buffalo and hawks. Mask performances generally take place in the dry season between February and May.  Bronzeworks  Blacksmiths are also known to make utensils and body adornments for their people. These pieces, much like the masks, tend to represent animals and their attributes associated with them. For example, a blacksmith may use a hyena to show stupidity or a bush cow to symbolize strength. The most common depictions are of the double chameleon and the hornbill. The chameleon would be mostly used by women who want to have children but cannot.  Instruments  Flutes are used daily. They are usually played in sets of 5 to 9 pieces. By playing short diverse patterns in an interlocking form, the musicians tell a story. It is a form of communication‚Äîreproducing the speech of tonal languages. They are commonly accompanied by dances. References=NotesBibliography= ** Bacquart, Jean-Baptiste (1998). The Tribal Arts of Africa. Thames and Hudson. ** Decalo, Samuel (1994).

Career Originally from the state of Odisha in India, Pati obtained his PhD from the University of Bombay, Mumbai. In 1989, he took up a position as a theoretical physicist in the Theoretical Physics Division, BARC, Mumbai, India. From 1998‚Äì2000, he was a visiting scientist and an EPSRC fellow at the University of Wales, Bangor, UK. He was a visiting scientist at the Institute of Physics, Bhubaneswar, India from 2001‚Äì2010. Currently, he is a Professor of Quantum Information at the Harish Chandra Research Institute, Allahabad, India since 2011. He is honored with K. P. Chair Professorship at Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China during the period 2013‚Äì2015.http://www.hri.res.in/~akpati/https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arun_Pati Work Along with Samuel L. Braunstein, he proved the quantum no-deleting theorem. Similar to the no-cloning theorem, the no-deleting theorem is a fundamental consequence of the linearity of quantum mechanics. This proves that given two copies of an unknown quantum state we cannot delete one copy. The no-cloning and the no-deleting theorems suggest that we can neither create nor destroy quantum information. His other important collaborative work with Braunstein includes the quantum no-hiding theorem. This states that if quantum information is lost from one subsystem then it remains in the rest of the universe and cannot be hidden in the quantum correlation between the original system and the environment. This has applications that include quantum teleportation, quantum state randomization, thermalization and the black hole information loss paradox. The no-hiding theorem has been experimentally tested and this is a clear demonstration of the conservation of quantum information. He also discovered the remote state preparation protocol in quantum information theory, which has been experimentally tested by several groups. He along with other scientists introduced the concept of geometric phase for mixed states. This has been experimentally measured by several groups around the world. In another fundamental work, Pati along with L. Maccone have discovered stronger uncertainty relations that go beyond the Heisenberg uncertainty relation. These new relations capture the notion of incompatible observables and show that quantum world is more uncertain than what Heisenberg-Robertson's uncertainty relation has explicated us. Honors Pati is the recipient of the India Physics Association Award for Young Physicist of the Year (2000) and the Indian Physical Society Awards for Young Scientists (1996). He is also recipient of Samanta Chandra Sekhar Award for the year 2009 from Orissa Bigyan Academy, Bhubaneswar, Odisha. He is an elected Fellow of the Indian Academy of Science, Bangalore.

The historic district includes 23 financial structures, including the city's first skyscraper, and three hotels all located along a stretch of South Spring Street from just north of Fourth Street to just south of Seventh Street. In the first half of the 20th Century, this stretch of Spring Street was the financial center of Los Angeles, with the important banks and financial institutions being concentrated there. At least ten of the buildings in the district were designed in whole or in part by John Parkinson, who designed many of the city's landmark buildings in the early 20th century, including the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, Los Angeles City Hall, Bullocks Wilshire, and Union Station. Ten of the buildings in the district have been designated as Historic-Cultural Monuments by the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission. History Continental Building, LA's first skyscraper =Early days= The city's central business district (CBD) in the 1880s and 1890s lay further north near South Spring and Temple Streets. The street can claim credit as the birthplace of the motion picture business in Los Angeles. In 1898, Thomas Edison filmed a 60-second film titled \\"South Spring Street Los Angeles California\\", mounting a giant camera on a wagon to film the bustling action along South Spring Street.South Spring Street Los Angeles California, Thomas Edison =Wall Street of the West= In the early 1900s, the city center began spreading south, and the city's banks and financial institutions began concentrating along South Spring Street. The first two important buildings to make the move south were the Hellman and Continental Buildings, with the Continental Building being considered the city's first skyscraper. (\\"‚ÄùThe Continental Building (first known as the Braly Building) was considered the first ‚Äòskyscraper‚Äô in Los Angeles.‚Äù) (saying of the Braly/Continental Building: ‚ÄúAt 12 stories, it was the city‚Äôs first skyscraper‚Ä¶‚Äù) In 1911, the Los Angeles Times boasted about the building boom on Spring Street: > The visitor to this city can at this moment observe skyscrapers in all > stages of construction. It is a study which will provide the most > comprehensible kind of answer to the query as to why Los Angeles is leading > San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, > Cincinnati, Baltimore, Detroit, Minneapolis, New Orleans, Boston, Buffalo > and all other cities of anything near her in building activity as revealed > by the monthly expenditures for construction work. The building boom along South Spring Street continued into the 1920s as the population and economy of Los Angeles boomed. South Spring Street remained the city's financial center even after World War II. =Decline of the district in the 1970s and 1980s= Decorations above entrance to E.F. Hutton Building In the 1960s, many of the banks and financial institutions began moving to the western part of the downtown area, along Figueroa Street and Wilshire Boulevard. By the early 1980s, South Spring Street had become known for \\"transients who sleep in doorways and urinate on sidewalks.\\" In 1982, the Los Angeles Times commented on the district's decline from \\"Wall Street of the West\\" to a blighted area with empty office buildings lining both sides of the street: > \\"When the banks and law firms moved to the 'Gold Coast' typified by Arco > Towers, six blocks to the west, Spring Street plummeted to become a > neighborhood of hoodlums, derelicts and winos‚Äîa neighborhood of echoing > buildings full of absolutely nothing above the ground floor.\\" =Redevelopment projects and regentrification= Since the early 1980s, South Spring Street has been the subject of numerous redevelopment projects. In recent years, numerous art galleries have moved into the old financial district, which is now known as Gallery Row. Many of the old bank buildings have also been converted into upscale lofts. As wealthier residents have moved into the district's lofts, older residents and artists have complained about the increased rents. One artist who had lived in the district for years said: > The real problem with downtown lately, Gronk and his friends half-jokingly > agreed is 'those people.' Westsiders. Trust-fund babies. New tenants who > demand their bohemian pleasures be liberally sweetened with suburban > amenities. Landlords who previously recruited artists to help make downtown > 'safe' for gentrification, then jacked up their rents so only lawyers and > screenwriters could afford it. =Beaux Arts architecture as the district's enduring strength= Moderne exterior of the Title Insurance Building The strength of the district remains its period architecture. Many of the Beaux Arts facades along Spring Street remain virtually intact, making the district a popular shooting location for motion picture and television productions seeking authentic period cityscapes. In 1985, noted Los Angeles Times columnist Jack Smith pointed to the Spring Street Financial District as proof that \\"Los Angeles was never the cultural wasteland it was alleged to be.\\" He hailed the district's \\"financial palaces\\" as \\"a solid architectural achievement\\" which give the street \\"beauty, strength, unity and dignity.\\" Buildings in the district Notable buildings in the district (from north to south) include: ; Hellman Building: Northeast corner of 4th and Spring ‚Äì Built in 1902, the Hellman and Continental Buildings were the first major structures to anchor the Spring Street Financial District. The Hellman Building, now known as Banco Popular, is an eight-story brick and concrete structure designed by Alfred Rosenheim. In 1998, Gilmore Associates announced plans to convert the Hellman Building, the Continental Building, and the San Fernando Building into 230 lofts. The converted buildings consisted of large, open lofts with high ceilings and no interior walls except for the bathrooms. The conversion was designed by architect Wade Killefer, who noted: \\"What lends these buildings to residential use is lots of windows and high ceilings, offering wonderful light.\\" The combined project became known as the Old Bank District lofts. ; The Continental Building: 408 S. Spring Street ‚Äì Built in 1902, the Continental Building was originally known as the Braly Building. The 12-story building was designed by John Parkinson and is considered the first \\"skyscraper\\" in Los Angeles. It was the tallest building in Los Angeles until 1907. It is known for its highly ornamental cornice and bands. The Continental Building was converted into lofts as part of Tom Gilmore's Old Bank District lofts project. It was designated a Historic Cultural Landmark (HCM #730) in 2002. ; El Dorado Hotel: 416 S. Spring Street ‚Äì Originally known as the Hotel Stowell, the 12-story hotel was built in 1913 and designed by Frederick Noonan with a highly stylized and brightly colored facade, enameled brick and terra cotta. Batchelder tiles are used extensively in the hotel and lobby. Shortly after the hotel opened, Charlie Chaplin lived at the Stowell, which he described as \\"a middle-rate place but new and comfortable.\\" Chaplin later told a story about receiving a telephone call while there concerning an appearance for which he was to be paid $25,000. Chaplin recalled: \\"My bedroom window opened out on the well of the hotel, so that the voice of anyone talking resounded through the rooms. The telephone connection was bad, 'I don't intend to pass up twenty-five thousand dollars for two weeks‚Äô work!' I had to shout several times. A window opened above and a voice shouted back: 'Cut out that bull and go to sleep, you big dope!'\\" In 2008, the building was converted into lofts under the name \\"El Dorado Lofts.\\" ; Title Insurance Building: 433 S. Spring Street ‚Äì Built in 1928, the Title Insurance Building is a ten-story building designed by John and Donald Parkinson in the Zig-Zag Moderne style. The marble lobby includes a mural by Hugo Ballin. The Title Insurance Building was the subject of the district's first major redevelopment project. Architect- developer Ragnar C. Qvale acquired the building in 1979. He took the impressive Art Deco shell and converted the building into the Design Center of Los Angeles, which he leased to wholesale household furniture showrooms. Early 2011, the ground floor of the building became an art gallery and coffee shop, and took the logical name of Groundfloor Gallery & Caf√©. The Title Insurance Building was designated a Historic Cultural Landmark (HCM #772) in 2003. ; Crocker Bank: 453 S. Spring Street ‚Äì Built in 1914, the 10-story building was designed by Parkinson and Bergstrom. The building was once the Los Angeles headquarters of Crocker Citizens National Bank. Now known as the Spring Arts Tower, the building is part of a movement to convert the old financial district into the city's \\"Gallery Row.\\" The building's interior features original Art Deco designs, Art Nouveau details, sculptured brass, Italian marble, Batchelder tile, California alder and tiger oak. The building's tenants include artists, designers, architects, film production companies, and law firms. A nightclub called the \\"Crocker Club\\" is scheduled to open on the vault floor in 2008. ; Rowan Building: 131 W. 5th Street ‚Äì Built in 1910, the 11-story Rowan Building was originally known as the Chester Building, designed by Parkinson & Bergstrom in a mix of Beaux Arts and Classical styles. Ornate cast iron rosettes hang from the building's cornice, and elegant glazed terra cotta panels cover the facade. During its construction, the Times described it as a \\"mammoth\\" structure being built with the most massive steel girders and beams ever used on the West CoaStreet The building, built from 3000 tons of steel, was the largest office in Los Angeles in 1911. During its construction, hundreds of people lined the street \\"to see the huge crane swinging these titanic metal units of the structural plan into place for the workmen with the air riveters.\\" Built by developer Robert A. Rowan, the Rowan Building once housed many of the city's prominent law offices and stock brokerage firms. It has been known over the years as the Central Fire Proof Building Company and the Chester Building and has been converted into 206 live/work condominium units with retail space on the ground floor.The Rowan Building History - ROWAN LOFTS - Los Angeles Downtown Many interior features including Carrara marble corridor walls and floors, mahogany windows, and detailed Art Deco elevator doors have been preserved. ; Alexandria Hotel: 210 W. 5th Street ‚Äì Built in 1906, the eight-story Alexandria Hotel is another building designed by John Parkinson. With 500 rooms, an elaborate wood lobby, and the glamorous Palm Court with its stained glass dome, the Alexandria was the most luxurious hotel in Los Angeles from the time it opened until the Biltmore opened in the mid-1920s. Movie stars and other celebrities, including Mae West, Humphrey Bogart, Rudolph Valentino, Clark Gable, Greta Garbo, Sarah Bernhardt, Enrico Caruso and Jack Dempsey were guests. Charlie Chaplin kept a suite at the Alexandria and did improvisations in the lobby where Tom Mix reportedly rode his horse. The carpet in the lobby was called the \\"million-dollar carpet\\", because there was purportedly a $1 million worth of business done there every day. It was there that D.W. Griffith, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks met in 1919 to form United Artists. U.S. Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft and Woodrow Wilson, and many foreign dignitaries, including King Edward VIII, also stayed at the hotel while visiting Los Angeles. The hotel declined after the Biltmore opened and closed in 1934, with its chandelier and gold leaf covering of the mezzanine lobby being stripped and sold. It reopened in 1937 but declined again in the 1950s, become a transient hotel with the Grand Ballroom being used as a training ring for boxers. Today, the Alexandria has been converted to apartments. The Palm Court in the Alexandria was designated a Historic Cultural Landmark (HCM #80) in 1971. ; Security Building: 510 S. Spring Street ‚Äì Built in 1906, the 11-story steel-frame Security Building was designed in an Italianate style by Parkinson and Bergstrom. When it was built, it was the tallest building in Los Angeles, surpassing the Continental Building. It remained the city's tallest building until 1911. The Security Building has been converted to lofts operated under the name \\"The Lofts at the Security Building.\\" The Security Building was designated a Historic Cultural Landmark (HCM #741) in 2003. ; Los Angeles Theater Center: 514 S. Spring Street ‚Äì Built in 1916, the one-story building was designed by John Parkinson in a Greek-Revival style with Ionic columns. In addition to the columns, the building is known for its lobby with a large 50 by stained glass ceiling supported by heavy ornamental bronze cornices and marble walls. It been known over the years as the Security Trust & Savings Building, the Security National Bank Building and the President Trading Company. In 1985, the building reopened as the Los Angeles Theater Center, a venue with multiple theaters offering live theatrical productions. The converted building has preserved the bank lobby with its stained glass ceiling. The Theater Center met with financial trouble and was forced to close. However, it was later re-opened by the City.The New Latc ; Spring Arcade Building: 541 S. Spring Street ‚Äì Built in 1924, the 12-story, double- wing Arcade Building, designed by architects Kenneth MacDonald and Maurice Couchot, includes a cavernous midblock arcade connecting Spring Street with Broadway. Originally known as the \\"Mercantile Arcade Building,\\" it was modeled on the Burlington Arcade in London, England. Its three-level, skylighted arcade has been called a space \\"as regal as almost any other interior space in the city.\\" The tower on top of the building once supported the antenna of the radio station KRKD (\\"RKD\\" = Arcade), from which Aimee Semple McPherson preached her message.USC Geography : LA Walking Tour : Historic Core : Arcade Building The ups and downs of the district were reflected in the sales of the Arcade Building. As the area fell into decline, it sold in 1977 for $300,000. Five years later, as redevelopment projects fueled speculation in Spring Street properties, it sold for $4.5 million‚Äî15 times its 1977 sale price. The building was converted into 142 loft apartments as part of a $15-million renovation. ; Lloyd's Bank: 548 S. Spring Street ‚Äì Built in 1913, the 12-story Lloyd's Bank was designed in the Commercial style by William Curlett & Son. The building has been converted into lofts and is now known as SB Lofts. The music video of I'll Be Over You was shot with the band, Toto, playing on the rooftop of this building. ; Pacific Southwest Bank: NW corner of 6th and Spring ‚Äì Built in 1910, the 11-story Pacific Southwest Bank was designed by Parkinson & Bergstrom in the Classical style with fluted columns. The building has been converted into lofts and is now known as SB Manhattan. ; United California Bank: 600 S. Spring Street ‚Äì Built in 1961 and designed by Claud Beelman & Associates, this contemporary glass and concrete building is one of the few nonconforming intrusions in the Spring Street Financial District. It was the first skyscraper to be built after the city's building height limit was lifted. City planners hoped it would solidify Spring Street as the city's financial center, but an exodus of banks and financial institutions began in the 1960s. ; Hotel Hayward: 601 S. Spring Street ‚Äì Built in 1905, the nine- story Hotel Hayward was designed by Charles Whittlesey. There is a 14-story addition on the western side that was added in 1925 and designed by John and Donald Parkinson. The Hotel Hayward plays a part in the 2007 movie \\"Transformers,\\" as the climactic battle between \\"Megatron\\" and \\"Optimus Prime\\" takes place on the street in front of The Hotel Hayward. ; Los Angeles Stock Exchange Building: 618 S. Spring Street ‚Äì Built in 1929, the eleven-story exchange building was designed by Samuel Lunden in the Moderne style. Ground was broken in October 1929, just as the Great Depression hit, and when the Los Angeles Stock Exchange opened its doors there in 1931, the country was deep into the Depression. There are three bas-relief panels carved by Salvatore Cartaino Scarpitta into the granite above the building's entrance. The panels portray the elements of a capitalist economy. The large central panel, \\"Finance\\", displays capitalists. The \\"Production\\" panel shows an aircraft engine, a steel worker pouring molten metal and a worker stirring it. The \\"Research and Discovery\\" panel shows oil derricks, factories, a chemist conducting an experiment and a man kneeling in a library reading a book. The interior is wonderfully preserved, and has ancient Near East and Native Indian influences by the designer Julian Ellsworth Garnsey. On the entrance lobby's ceiling the Wilson Studio created four sculpted figures representing: Speed (Mercury), Accuracy (the archer), Permanence (a figure contemplating the universe), and Equality (the figure bearing scales). The highlight of the interior was its massive 90' x 74' balconied trading floor with a forty-foot ceiling and sixty-four booths. On fifth floor was a clearing-house with a statistics department, an auditorium, and a lecture room. Offices occupied floors six through nine, and the top two floors included: a club with a library, a card room, a billiard room, and reading rooms. The basement held a 2,660-sq. ft. printing room and a vault. In 1986, the exchange (by then part of the Pacific Stock Exchange) moved out of the building. In the late 1980s, the Community Redevelopment Agency helped fund a night club that opened in the Exchange Building‚Äîcalled the Stock Exchange, but the club did not survive the 1980s. In late 2008, the building underwent extensive renovations and reopened in 2010 as Exchange LA nightclub. The visually dynamic building and interiors are frequently used for location filming, and has been featured in The Big Lebowski, The Social Network, and numerous television shows and commercials. Special events include corporate parties, product debuts, and fashion shows. The Stock Exchange Building was designated a Historic Cultural Landmark (HCM #205) in 1979. ; E.F. Hutton Building: 623 S. Spring Street ‚Äì Built in 1931, the 12-story Zig-Zag Moderne E.F. Hutton Building once housed E.F. Hutton's big board. The Hutton and California Canadian Bank were the first office buildings to be converted into residences. In 1984, the Community Redevelopment Agency converted the adjacent towers into 121 condominiums in a project called Premiere Towers. However, when most of the units failed to sell, the agency sold the project to a developer who offered the units for rental‚Äîin the process destroying property values for those who had purchased units. ; California Canadian Bank: 625 S. Spring Street ‚Äì Built in 1923, the 12-story Neo-Classical building includes terra cotta ornamentation on the top two levels. The building is now part of the Premiere Towers project with the E.F. Hutton Building. ; Mortgage Guaranty Building: 626 S. Spring Street ‚Äì Built in 1913, the six-story Mortgage Guaranty Building (also known as the Sassony Building) has a decorative cornice and fluted columns. In 2004, the structure was converted into 36 apartments called \\"City Lofts\\" by developer Izek Shomof.http://www.downtownnews.com/articles/2004/09/20/development/estate04.txt ; Banks & Huntley Building: 632 S. Spring Street ‚Äì Built in 1930, the Banks & Huntley Building was designed by John and Donald Parkinson in the Moderne style. It is now known as The Nonprofit Center, housing the national and regional offices for MALDEF, a Latino civil rights organization. The building also rents space to other nonprofit organizations providing assistance to minority and underserved communities. The building has been restored to its original Art Deco design. The Banks & Huntley Building was designated a Historic Cultural Landmark (HCM #631) in 1999. ; Barclays Bank: 639 S. Spring Street ‚Äì Built in 1919, the 13-story Barclays Bank was designed by Morgan, Walls & Morgan. The Barclays Bank building was designated a Historic Cultural Landmark (HCM #671) in 1999. ; A.G. Bartlett Building: 651 S. Spring Street ‚Äì Built in 1911, the Bartlett Building was originally known as the Union Oil Building and served as the headquarters of Union Oil Company until 1923. The building was designed by Parkinson & Bergstrom. It was also the place where Southwestern Law School got its start in 1911 with a few young men meeting three nights a week to study law with a tutor. ; Bank of America Building: 650 S. Spring Street ‚Äì Built in 1924, the 12-story Bank of America Building was designed by Schultze & Weaver. Its facade has Indian limestone and terra cotta in a style reminiscent of Louis Sullivan. The building has been converted into lofts and is now known as SB Spring. ; Financial Center Building: 704 S. Spring Street ‚Äì Built in 1923, the 13-story Financial Center Building was designed by S. Tilden Norton and Frederick Wallis. The facade has pressed brick and terra cotta. ; I.N. Van Nuys Building: 210 W. 7th Street ‚Äì Built in 1911 by the Isaac Newton Van Nuys (a noted banker and owner of much of the San Fernando Valley), the Van Nuys Building is an 11-story building in Classical style with Italianate details. The Times reported in 1911 that the magnificent new building would be \\"the city's most expensive office building\\" at $1,250,000. In the early 1980s, City redevelopment agencies spent $24.3 million to convert the Van Nuys Building into 299 units of housing for senior citizens and the handicapped. The Van Nuys Building was designated a Historic Cultural Landmark (HCM #898) in 2007. Historic designation and walking tours Due to the large percentage of historic bank and financial buildings that remain intact in the district, the area was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The Los Angeles Conservancy offers walking tours of the Spring Street Financial District on the fourth Saturday of each month at 10 a.m.; the tour lasts approximately 2-1/2 hours and costs $10 for the general public (reduced rate for Conservancy members).

Multicore Association is a member-funded, non-profit, industry consortium focused on the creation of open standard APIs, specifications, and guidelines that allow system developers and programmers to more readily adopt multicore technology into their applications. The consortium provides a neutral forum for vendors and developers who are interested in, working with, and/or proliferating multicore-related products, including processors, infrastructure, devices, software, and applications. Its members represent vendors of processors, operating systems, compilers, development tools, debuggers, ESL/EDA tools, and simulators; and application and system developers. The consortium's president is Markus Levy, who is also president of EEMBC, the Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium. Sven Brehmer is the CTO, as well as president of PolyCore Software.  Completed Projects  In 2008, the Multicore Communications API working group released the consortium's first specification, referred to as MCAPI. MCAPI is a message-passing API that captures the basic elements of communication and synchronization that are required for closely distributed (multiple cores on a chip and/or chips on a circuit board) embedded systems. The target systems for MCAPI span multiple dimensions of heterogeneity (e.g., core heterogeneity, interconnect fabric heterogeneity, memory heterogeneity, operating system heterogeneity, software toolchain heterogeneity, and programming language heterogeneity). In 2011, the MCAPI working group released MCAPI 2.0. The enhanced version adds new features, such as domains for routing purposes. MCAPI Version 2.0 adds a level of hierarchy into that network of nodes through the introduction of \\"domains\\". Domains can be used in a variety of implementation-specific ways, such as for representing all the cores on a given chip or for dividing a topology into public and secure areas. MCAPI 2.0 also adds three new types of initialization parameters (node attributes, implementation-specific configurations, implementation information such as the initial network topology or the MCAPI version being executed). The MCAPI WG is chaired by Sven Brehmer. In 2011, the Multicore Resource Management API working group released its first specification, referred to as MRAPI. MRAPI is an industry-standard API that specifies essential application-level resource management capabilities. Multicore applications require this API to allow coordinated concurrent access to system resources in situations where: (1) there are not enough resources to dedicate to individual tasks or processors, and/or (2) the Run time (program lifecycle phase) system does not provide a uniformly accessible mechanism for coordinating resource sharing. This API is applicable to both SMP and AMP embedded multicore implementations (whereby AMP refers to heterogeneous both in terms of software and hardware). MRAPI (in conjunction with other Multicore Association APIs) can serve as a valuable tool for implementing applications, as well as for implementing such full-featured resource managers and other types of layered services. The MRAPI WG was chaired by Jim Holt. In 2013, the Multicore Task Management API (MTAPI) working group released its first specification. MTAPI is a standard specification for an application program interface (API) that supports the coordination of tasks on embedded parallel systems with homogeneous and heterogeneous cores. Core features of MTAPI are runtime scheduling and mapping of tasks to processor cores. Due to its dynamic behavior, MTAPI is intended for optimizing throughput on multicore-systems, allowing the software developer to improve the task scheduling strategy for latency and fairness. This working group was chaired by Urs Gleim of Siemens. In 2013, the Multicore Programming Practices (MPP) working group delivered a multicore software programming guide for the industry that aids in improving consistency and understanding of multicore programming issues. The MPP guide provides best practices leveraging the C/C++ language to generate a guide of genuine value to engineers who are approaching multicore programming. This working group was chaired by Rob Oshana of NXP Semiconductors and David Stewart of CriticalBlue. in 2015, the Software/Hardware Interface for Multicore/Manycore (SHIM) working group delivered a specification to define an architecture description standard useful for software design. Some architectural features that SHIM describes are the hardware topology including processor cores, accelerators, caches, and inter-core communication channels, with selected details of each element, and instruction, memory, and communication performance information. This working group was chaired by Masaki Gondo of eSOL . Active Working Groups * The Multicore Communications API (MCAPI) working group is currently adding more features and functions to expand the usefulness of MCAPI for Version 2.x. The working group is working on interoperability and 'zero copy' functionality, including bidirectional interaction between 'application and application' using shared memory and bidirectional interaction between 'application and driver', which is being led by Sven Brehmer of PolyCore Software. * The Virtualization working group will focus on defining and optimizing a set of paravirtualization information and functions to communicate with a Hypervisor. The working group will also focus on a system to categorize the various virtualization features and functionality including within multicore processors. This working group is chaired by Rajan Goyal of Cavium Networks and Surender Kumar of Nokia Networks. * The Open Asymmetric Multi Processing (OpenAMP) working group will focus on standardizing the APIs, providing detailed documentation for the specification, and expanding the functionality of OpenAMP. This working group is chaired by Tomas Evensen of Xilinx.

IVC supports members of its corps through monthly faith sharing meetings, occasional retreats, and opportunities for one on one spiritual reflection in the Ignatian tradition.  History  In response to both the growing retired and semi-retired community in the U.S. and the desire of mature adults to express their faith in the light of Vatican II, Jim Conroy S.J. and Charlie Costello S.J. launched Ignatian Volunteer Corps (IVC). IVC began in September 1995 with eleven service members in three cities (Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington D.C.). Corps members began by serving children and adults in need and reflecting together on their service experiences. Today, over 600 corps members serve in 25 cities across the country. The organization relies on a network of Directors and Regional Councils, led by a President/CEO and a national Board of Directors. The IVC national office is located in Baltimore, Maryland. In 2002, Jim Conroy stepped down from the Executive director position in order to continue his Jesuit mission of service elsewhere. He still maintains contact with IVC and serves on the Board of Directors. On October 29, 2004, Charlie Costello died from ill health. IVC was founded 1995 by Jim Conroy SJ and Charlie Costello SJ in response to both the growing retired and semi-retired community in the U.S. and the desire of mature adults to express their faith in the light of Vatican II. From a handful of service members working in Baltimore at its founding, IVC has grown to over 650 service members nationwide. As IVC grew, it adopted a regional chapter model with twenty-three regions reporting to a national headquarters in Baltimore. Regional offices are managed by directors who have the resources, flexibility, and sufficient autonomy to accomplish the local mission of IVC while conforming to the essential norms and values of the IVC. Each office is expected to be economically viable, which is to say, covering all local operating expenses plus sharing in overhead costs related to all IVC regions such as costs related to accounting, payroll, grant writing, and marketing support.  The Program  Members of IVC's service corps commit to 600 hours a year (roughly two days a week) of skilled service with local charities. IVC works with partner community organizations addressing myriad social ills and working to create a more just world. Candidates for service positions are screened and vetted by region directors. Suitable candidates are then matched with a service placement based on skills, experience, and desire. IVC service members commit to one year of service with the ability to renew that commitment each year thereafter. Along with their hours of service with partner agencies, IVC service members attend monthly support meetings and engage on reflection on their service assignment. IVC service members receive no material compensation for their work, remain in their own homes and continue to be involved in their family, parish and community activities. Partner agencies apply to IVC to receive a service member. IVC leverages human capital in the form of lifetimes of personal and professional experience. Partner agencies gain voluntary part-time nurses, lawyers, counselors, architects, and financial planner through IVC.  IVC's Roots  IVC accepts and encourages Ignatian volunteers of all Christian faiths. The program itself is rooted in the spirituality of St. Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Society of Jesus. While members of the Society of Jesus, or Jesuits, are members of a religious order, IVC is one way among many for lay people to experience Ignatian spirituality. Ignatian spirituality is the practice of taking time to reflect and pray, to imitate Jesus and to discern God‚Äôs calling. IVC borrows much from St. Ignatius of Loyola - his compassion; his commitment to people who are poor, marginalized, and abandoned; his desire to serve and bring about reconciliation in the world through love.Documents of General Congregation 34 - A Synopsis IVC encourages its Volunteers to proceed in such a way of pilgrimage and labor in Christ. The concepts of mission and reflection surface frequently in the Spiritual Reflection component of IVC. To a follower of Ignatian spirituality, service and reflection reinforce each other and seek to unite the volunteer with a very real notion of charity and, therefore, mission to live as ‚Äúmen and women for others‚Äù. Ignatius writes in The Spiritual Exercises, \\"Consider the address which Christ our Lord makes to all his servants and friends whom He sends on this enterprise, recommending to them to seek to help all, first by attracting them to the highest spiritual poverty, and should it please the Divine Majesty, and should he deign to choose them for it, even to actual poverty.\\" IVC promotes in mature adults the expression of divine love through service of and in the world.  2007 CARA Study  In January 2007, IVC turned to the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate (CARA) at Georgetown University in order to better understand the effect of IVC on its former and current Ignatian Volunteers, spouses and spiritual reflectors. The resulting national survey of volunteers found that over 93% felt that their service in IVC had helped them feel that they were spending their retirement in a fulfilling way.Ignatian Volunteer Corps: Survey of Volunteers, Spouses, and Spiritual Reflectors, CARA Study, January 2007: p. 41 91% of volunteers felt that the spiritual reflection component of IVC had somewhat or very much helped them to see God in the people they served.Ignatian Volunteer Corps: Survey of Volunteers, Spouses, and Spiritual Reflectors, CARA Study, January 2007: p. 46 One volunteer said, ‚ÄúThe most satisfying [experience] was the looks on the faces of nearly a dozen cook- trainees when I responded to an inquiry by one of them as to why I did this individual resource for them. I answered: ‚ÄúBecause I love you.‚Äù The silence was absolute for maybe a minute and then they all stood as one and applauded; at least four of us were crying.‚ÄùIgnatian Volunteer Corps: Survey of Volunteers, Spouses, and Spiritual Reflectors, CARA Study, January 2007: p. 57  External links * Ignatian Volunteer Corps * Society of Jesus in the U.S.A. * Catholic Network of Volunteer Services  References  Non-profit organizations based in the United States Society of Jesus ","title":"Ignatian Volunteer Corps"},{"id":"18541370","text":"An Unfinished Journey is a posthumous collection of essays by Shiva Naipaul, published by Hamish and Hamilton in 1986.

The Yarlung Tsangpo is the upper section of the Brahmaputra River. The Lhasa River is subject to flooding with the summer monsoon rains, and structures have been built to control the floods. In its lower reaches the river valley is an important agricultural area. The city of Lhasa, named after the river, lies on the river. There are two large hydroelectric power stations on the river, the Zhikong Hydro Power Station (100 MW) and the Pangduo Hydro Power Station (160 MW) Basin The Lhasa River drains an area of , and is the largest tributary of the middle section of the Yaluzangbu River. The average altitude of the basin is around . The basin has complex geology and is tectonically active. Earthquakes are common. The river basin is the center of Tibet politically, economically and culturally. As of 1990 the population was 329,700, of whom 208,700 were farmers. 88% of the people were ethnic Tibetans. The climate is semi-arid monsoon, with a low average temperature of . Average annual precipitation is , with 85% falling in the June‚ÄìSeptember period. Annual runoff is . Water quality is good, with little discharge of sewage and minimal chemical pesticides and fertilizers. The basin has about of farmland, of which is irrigated. There are of grasslands that may be used for pasturage, and of forest. Course The Lhasa River is the longest of the Yarlung Tsangpo tributaries. It flows through the south of the Tibet Autonomous Region of China, and is a left tributary of the Yarlung Tsangpo. It is about long. The river forms where three smaller rivers converge. These are the Phak Chu, the Phongdolha Chu which flows from Damxung County and the Reting Tsangpo, which rises beyond the Reting Monastery. The highest tributary rises at around on the southern slope of the Nyenchen Tanglha Mountains. In its upper reaches the river flows southeast through a deep valley. Lower down the river valley is flatter and changes its direction to the southwest, The river expands to a width of . Major tributaries in the lower reaches include the Pengbo River and the Duilong River. At its mouth the Lhasa Valley is about wide. It enters the Tsangpo at a point where that river makes a sharp turn to the south, and which therefore seems to be a continuation of the Lhasa River. The river is navigable from its mouth on the Yarlung Tsangpo up to the city of Lhasa and to altitudes of up to . Intensive melting of snow and glaciers starts in May, contributing 20‚Äì30% of the water. The bulk of the water is supplied by the summer monsoon rains, which fall from July to September. There are floods in the summer from July to September, with about 17% of the annual runoff flowing in September. In winter the river has low water, and sometimes freezes. Total flow is about , with average flow about . Fish population The Lhasa River has mean monthly water temperatures that range from about . Average water temperatures are . There are abundant species of fish that are adapted to the clear and cool water. The cool temperatures, with the upstream reaches above freezing over at times, has the effect of delaying growth of fish such as Oxygymnocypris stewartii. The Tibetan plateau has thin air and clouds, which combined with the clear water gives strong illumination from a full moon. This may affect the fishes' circadian rhythm. In 2009 it was reported that fish caught in the lower reaches of the river had been decreasing slightly in size, probably due to increasing demand and construction of hydroelectric dams. Settlements Potala Palace, Lhasa from the east (1938) The river valley is one of the main agricultural areas of Tibet. The city of Lhasa lies on its shore, and there are many Buddhist monasteries in the valley. Riwo Ganden Nampar Gyelp√© Ling, the first fortress of the Gelukpa sect, was built on the left bank in 1409, about upstream from Lhasa. In 1416 the monastery of Ch√∂dra Chenpo Penden Drepung was built on the right bank near to the Neudzong fortress. The ruins of the Sne'u rdzong fortress are on the left bank of the river, opposite the Norbulingka summer palace of the Dalai Lamas in Lhasa. The climate in the central river valleys of Tibet is comparatively mild. They are warm in summer, and even in the coldest months of winter the temperature is above freezing on sunny days. A visitor described the valley around Lhasa in 1889 as follows, William Montgomery McGovern wrote in To Lhasa in Disguise (1924) that the right tributary of the Lhasa River, the Ti, which enters the river a few miles below Lhasa, was crossed by a very large and imposing bridge over a hundred yards long, with masonry piers and substantial stone embankments. McGovern also described the Yutok-sampa, or Turquoise Bridge, a structure with walls and a roof that crossed what had been the main Lhasa River but was now a stagnant canal. As late as 1984 kowas, yak hide boats similar to coracles, were being used to ferry passengers across the Lhasa River. The Liuwu Bridge was constructed across the Lhasa River to link central Lhasa to Lhasa railway station on the south bank. The bridge was completed in 2007. In 2010 there was a small hydroelectric power station. Prior to 2011, waste water from Lhasa was discharged untreated into the river. A waste water treatment plant designed to process 50,000 tons of sewage per day was commissioned in July 2011. Barrages Before the incorporation of Tibet into the People's Republic of China (1950‚Äì51), the agricultural engineer Peter Aufschnaiter designed a dam on the Lhasa River to protect the palace of Norbulingka in the city of Lhasa from flooding, with a water supply canal to the city. Heinrich Harrer monitored the work. In 1948 Heinrich Harrer had to intervene to reinforce a dyke that protected the Norbulingka from inundations by the Lhasa River, which was wide after the monsoon. Harrer directed a work crew of 500 soldiers and 1,000 laborers paid by the government of Tibet. A fleet of 40 Yak skin boats were used to carry granite blocks extracted from a quarry upstream of the Norbulingka. Harrer mentions some difficulties. The Tibetans did not work as hard as westerners, and would stop to help worms when they found them. There were several hundred women working on the site. The soldiers did not fail to make jokes with them, to which they responded promptly. The site was often visited by members of the Tibetan government, who would give out silk scarves, and rewards were distributed to the workers. The total hydropower potential of the river basin is 2,560,000 kW. 83 medium and small hydroelectric plants had been built by 1989, delivering a total of 26,124 kW. Construction of the Zhikong Hydro Power Station in Maizhokunggar County began in May 2003. The reservoir is at an elevation of above sea level. The project cost 1.37 billion yuan. The dam impounds of water. The 100 MW power station came into operation in September 2007. The Pondo Water-Control Project dammed the Lhasa River in Lh√ºnzhub County. Work started in 2008, and progressed on schedule. It is at an elevation of above sea level. The project includes a reservoir and a power station with potential annual generating capacity of 599 million kilowatt hours. The project, also called the Pangduo hydro project, impounds of water. It is planned to irrigate . Damming of the river stream was completed in October 2011. The project was due to start operating its first generator in October 2013. The project involved a total investment of 4.569 billion yuan, or about 0.74 billion US dollars, and has been called the \\"Tibetan Three Gorges\\". It was built as part of the Western Development Strategy. The dam also supports flood prevention and water supply.

He served as a member of the Council of the District of Columbia from January 1993 to January 2005, and was an unsuccessful candidate for Mayor of the District of Columbia in 1998. At present, Mr. Chavous is the President of Academics, Policy, and Schools of K12, Inc., a technology-based education company and the nation‚Äôs leading provider of proprietary curriculum and online school programs for students in pre-K through high school. In that role, Mr. Chavous oversees all of the services that the company provides to over 120,000 students nationwide.https://marketbrief.edweek.org/marketplace-k-12/k12-inc-taps- school-choice-advocate-kevin-chavous-leadership-post/ Early life and education Chavous was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, the son of Bettie J. and Harold P. Chavous. His father was a pharmacist and his mother a civil rights activist. Chavous was the oldest of four children. His first job was working at Chavous Drugs, his father's drug store, sweeping and mopping floors and stocking shelves. Chavous was educated at Brebeuf Jesuit Preparatory School in Indianapolis and Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Indiana, where he earned a bachelor's degree in political science. While at Wabash, he was NCAA Division III District All-American in basketball. Chavous also earned a JD degree from the Howard University School of Law in Washington, D.C., where he was president of his law school class. He is a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity. Community activism After graduating from law school, Chavous became a personal injury lawyer for the D.C. law firm of Cadeaux & Tagliere. The Chavouses and their children lived in Hillcrest, an affluent neighborhood in Southeast Washington on the District-Maryland border. In May 1988, Chavous was elected to the District of Columbia Democratic State Committee, representing Ward 7.; The following year, Pepco, an electric power public utility, proposed a significant expansion of its coal-fired power generating plant on the edge of the River Terrace neighborhood in Ward 7. The River Terrace Community Organization, a group representing citizens living in the neighborhood, opposed the plant, and Chavous agreed to represent the group in court pro bono. Pepco cancelled the expansion in 1991, and Chavous gained significant visibility for his work. Chavous also joined the national board of directors of Handgun Control, Inc., a group working for strong federal gun control legislation. 1992 council race and term=1992 council race= The Pepco fight launched Chavous' political career. Chavous, who by now was hosting a once-a-week program on legal issues on radio station WDCU-FM, announced in May 1992 that he would challenge incumbent Ward 7 Councilmember H. R. Crawford. Crawford, The Washington Post reported, was facing strong criticism from voters from his legislative achievements and three Democratic primary election challengers. Chavous waged an intensive grassroots campaign to unseat Crawford. According to The Washington Post, Chavous visited every single-family residence in Ward 7 personally, either speaking with members of the household or leaving behind campaign literature. On September 15, 1992, Chavous unseated Crawford, 4,866 votes (41.7 percent) to 4,266 (37 percent). In the general election on November 3, 1992, Chavous easily defeated Republican candidate Johnnie Scott Rice, 96 percent to 4 percent.; =First council term= Chavous was sworn in on January 2, 1993. During his first term on the council, Chavous aligned with Ward 2 council member Jack Evans (elected in 1991), At-Large council member William Lightfoot (elected in 1988), and Ward 6 council member Harold Brazil (elected in 1991) to form a caucus known as the \\"Young Turks\\". Together, they successfully opposed tax increases sought for the city by Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly. On June 22, 1993, an unidentified gunman sprayed the public swimming pool at the Benning Park Recreation Center with fire from a semiautomatic weapon. Panic-stricken children and adults fled the pool, and six children were wounded by gunfire. The incident highlighted the high level of gun violence in Ward 7, and The Washington Post said Chavous was thrust into the citywide spotlight by it. Chavous personally brought his two young children to the pool (which had seen almost no visitors since the attack) on June 29 to demonstrate the pool's safety and send a message of defiance to drug dealers and violent criminals. On September 26, 1993, four- year-old Launice Smith was shot in the head and hand (and survived) while her family watched a pick-up football game at Weatherless Elementary School in the Fort Dupont neighborhood in Ward 7. Smith was injured when four gunmen emerged from a nearby woods and then hunted down and executed 20-year-old Kervin Brown in what D.C. police said was part of an ongoing battle between rival drug gangs. Once more, Chavous was seen as one of the most important political leaders responding to violence in the city. On September 29, he announced for the formation of a 20-member task force on public safety and began pushing for Ward 7 residents to police their own neighborhoods and report drug dealing, crime, and violence. Chavous later called the task force one of the most important developments of his first term. Among other key legislative accomplishments in his first term was a 1993 act allowing the city to seize abandoned vehicles; and 1994 legislation that enacted a temporary ban on new liquor licenses for stores selling beer by the can (so-called \\"takeout beer\\").; He and the other Young Turks also successfully enacted in 1995 a $70 million cut in the wages earned by trade union members under the city's version of the Davis‚ÄìBacon Act. (The cut was temporary, and expired in 1996.) Chavous' legislative activism declined significantly over his first term. Chavous told The Washington Post in February 1996 that \\"it has proved easier to wait for someone else, be it the mayor or the control board, to propose hard solutions,\\" according to journalists Howard Schneider and David A. Vise. He unsuccessfully supported in 1995 a package of conservative Republican Party proposals to significantly change the way the city provided welfare benefits, and a plan to create an independent school board to approve and oversee charter schools. One significant (and eventually successful) change he advocated was the creation of a District of Columbia Financial Control Board to save the city from bankruptcy. He was one of the first council members to call for federal oversight (in early 1995), although later in the year he refused to vote to cut big-ticket items such as unemployment benefits or the city's summer youth jobs program. Congress created a financial control board in April 1995. 1996 reelection and second council term=1996 council race= Chavous sought reelection in 1996. He faced a challenger in the Democratic primary election, District of Columbia Board of Education member Terry Hairston. In July 1996, Hairston challenged Chavous' right to be on the ballot. D.C. election law required a candidate to obtain signatures from at least 250 voters in a ward in order to run for a district council seat in that ward. Chavous submitted signatures from 574 voters. But D.C. law also required that all individuals gathering such signatures be residents of the District of Columbia, and Hairston alleged that Chavous campaign worker Calvin S. Hawkins did not meet that condition. The District of Columbia Board of Elections ruled in Chavous' favor on July 30, 1996. In the Democratic primary held on September 10, 1996, Chavous easily defeated Hairston and another challenger, Eddie Rhodes, winning 68 percent of the vote.; Chavous won 90 percent of the vote in the general election on November 5, easily beating D.C. Statehood Party candidate Durand A. Ford (6 percent) and Republican Party candidate James Bernard Miles (3 percent).; =Second council term= On December 30, 1996, Chavous was elected chairman of the Council's Committee on Education, Libraries and Recreation. Ward 3 council member Kathy Patterson, a veteran education activist, also fought for the chairmanship. Patterson strongly criticized Chavous' commitment to educational reform, but Council Chairman David A. Clarke awarded the post to Chavous after he publicly declared education reform to be the biggest issue facing the sity. Patterson, however, won an agreement that stripped jurisdiction over labor issues from Chavous' committee and gave it to the Committee on Government Operations (chaired by Patterson). During his first year in office, the District of Columbia Public Schools undertook an emergency $50 million project to repair leaking and structurally unsound roofs at several public schools. The project was significantly mismanaged, and forced a delay in the opening of the school year. Chavous ordered a hearing on the issue in September 1997, but a significant number of parents of schoolchildren complained he had not provided enough oversight and acted too late. In March 1997, Chavous sponsored another significant piece of legislation, a resolution disapproving a construction contract for the highly controversial Barney Circle Freeway. Chavous also opposed construction of a new convention center in the city. As late as May 27, 1998, Chavous said he had not decided whether to support the project. But he voted to oppose it during the council's vote on June 2, arguing that plans to build a convention center smaller than many then under construction was \\"a plan to build a second-tier convention center\\". After his losing mayoral campaign, Chavous became what The Washington Post called a \\"frequent critic\\" of the new mayor, Anthony A. Williams, and had \\"the chilliest relationship with the mayor\\" of any Council member. Chavous was an early supporter of Councilmember Carol Schwartz's tax cut package in March 1999, which became law in May.; Chavous also led a nine-month effort to reconstitute and reform the D.C. Board of Education. After a long battle with Mayor Williams and other Council members, the Council approved a plan to reduce the size of the board, and make four of the nine members subject to mayoral appointment (with Council confirmation). Voters were asked to approve the \\"hybrid\\" board, which they did so in a close vote in June 2000.; According to The Washington Post, the bruising school board battle helped and hindered Chavous politically. While his allies said it showed he could tackle tough problems, dissenters argued that Chavous avoided the real issues (lack of money for schools and crumbling infrastructure). Chavous blamed the lengthy legislative process on unnamed individuals who he said did not engage in good faith in the process, but critics argued that Chavous never engaged in the kind of political hardball that was needed to move the reform bill along faster. Larry Gray, legislative chairman of the D.C. Congress of PTAs, blamed Chavous for deep cuts in the school budget during the past four years, failures in the teacher certification program, and significant delays in getting technology into the classroom. =Private-sector work= In late 1998, after his campaign for mayor, Chavous left Cadeaux & Tagliere and joined the law firm of Arent, Fox, Kintner, Plotkin & Kahn. Chavous left Arent Fox and was appointed Vice President of Communications for Covad Communications Group, a broadband provider, in December 1999. But he left that position after just a year. Citing his somewhat difficult reelection campaign, Chavous said he wanted to devote more time to his Council position. Several years later, in March 2001, Chavous rejoined Arent Fox as counsel, a part-time position in which he specialized in business law, government relations, and general litigation.Sewell, Chan; Blum, Justin (May 10, 2001). \\"Council Candidate Brazile?

In 2002, Chavous took a job as a partner at the law firm of Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal, practicing education and government law.McElhatton, Jim (June 1, 2004). \\"Legal Work Boosts Salaries\\". The Washington Times. Retrieved November 4, 2015. 1998 mayoral campaign As early as January 1997, The Washington Post said, Chavous was running an all-but-announced campaign for mayor; to unseat incumbent Marion Barry. As part of a staff shakeup to improve his election chances, Chavous fired Jim Ford, the veteran staff director of the Committee on Education, Libraries and Recreation. Valerie Strauss of The Washington Post said Ford's dismissal \\"robbed the committee of its institutional memory and one of its most vocal advocates for school reform.\\" But although Chavous had worked diligently to improve his name recognition and standing with the public, he garnered just 7 percent of those likely voters polled by The Washington Post in May 1997. Chavous formally announced his campaign for mayor on February 10, 1998, and raised $117,000 in the first month of his campaign. Chavous trailed the other leading candidate in the race, Jack Evans, who raised more than $307,000 since early December 1997, as well as restaurateur Jeffrey Gildenhorn, who donated $400,000 of his own money to his own campaign. More than a third of the campaign contributions to the Chavous campaign came from individuals living outside the District of Columbia. Chavous said in April 1998 that, if elected, he would focus heavily on education reform. He rejected school vouchers, but promised to fire principals and teachers who did not meet performance standards and create a boarding school for troubled youth. He also said he would disband the police oversight group established by the Financial Control Board, and work to revive commercial areas throughout the city. He later said he would cut a number of taxes levied by the city, including the corporate income tax, and seek passage of a federal law that would replace the current progressive federal income tax on city residents with a flat federal income tax of 15 percent. He also proposed universal early childhood education, and significantly improved city services for Latino residents. By mid-May, a Post poll showed 29 percent of voters favoring a sixth Barry term. Harold Brazil had 16 percent, Kevin Chavous had 15 percent, and Jack Evans had 10 percent. On May 21, Barry said he would not seek reelection. The announcement was a boost for Chavous, as polling showed that Barry's supporters were most likely to support him over other mayoral candidates. However, on May 30, 1998, Anthony A. Williams entered the race for mayor. Williams was the city's Chief Financial Officer, a position created by the same federal legislation which created the Financial Control Board. Williams had helped steer the city toward financial solvency, and had proven immensely popular among residents. By early June, the Chavous campaign had raised more than $260,000 in campaign donations in an attempt to reach its $750,000 goal; about 25 percent of the contributions came from non-District residents. On June 20, Chavous barely won a straw poll of Democrats in Ward 8. Anthony Williams came in a close second, in what The Washington Post called a sign of weakening support for Chavous. But nine days later, he won the endorsement of the Metropolitan Washington AFL‚ÄìCIO, a broad coalition of trade unions. On July 1, Vickey Wilcher, the manager of Chavous' mayoral campaign, quit amid rumors of infighting among Chavous' top aides. The Washington Post reported that several top campaign staff were angered by Chavous' \\"indecisiveness\\" over the convention center issue. They were also alarmed that Chavous had failed to win the Ward 8 endorsement, and they fought with other campaign managers over the direction of the Chavous effort. The campaign received another blow a few days later when the influential Washington Teachers Union broke with the AFL-CIO and endorsed Williams for mayor. In July, Chavous raised another $100,000 toward his campaign goal. But Anthony Williams raised more than $400,000‚Äîmost of it in small donations from voters throughout the city. Chavous also loaned his campaign $25,000. As the primary season wound down, a Post poll released on September 3, 1998, showed Williams with 37 percent of the vote and Chavous with 20 percent. A few days later, the Washington Teachers Union, D.C. Construction and Building Trades Council, Washington Social Workers Association, D.C. Nurses' Association, and National Hispanic Law Enforcement Association accused Chavous of missing 37 percent of all Council sessions during his first term in office, an accusation Chavous strongly denied. In the last month of the mayoral race, Williams raised $303,000 compared with just over $77,000 for Chavous. Chavous concluded the race having raised just $450,000 toward his goal of $750,000, and he had only $66,000 for the final week of the campaign compared to Williams' $97,500. Anthony Williams won the Democratic primary election held on September 15, 1998. Williams received 50 percent of the vote, with Chavous a distant second at 35 percent. Williams easily defeated Republican Carol Schwartz in the general election on November 4, 66 percent to 30 percent. He carried all eight wards by a solid margin.; 2000 reelection and third term=2000 council race= Chavous announced he would run for a third four-year term on the Council of the District of Columbia in June 2000. His primary campaign faced significant problems. In June, the Far Northeast/Southeast Council, a coalition of Advisory Neighborhood Commissions (ANC) and neighborhood civic associations, voted \\"no-confidence\\" in Chavous, saying he had been absent from too many community meetings and events and had failed to keep resident informed about major changes in their ward (such as the relocation of the D.C. Department of Employment Services and the opening of a new charter school). In late July, the Metropolitan Washington Council of the AFL-CIO declined to make an endorsement in the Ward 7 Council primary race, after the Washington Federation of Teachers accused Chavous of ignoring their input on education policy. (The teachers union also declined an endorsement in August.) By August 4, Chavous had only raised $2,100 in contributions, but spent more than $46,500. (He used funds left over from his 1998 mayoral race to reduce that deficit to just $7,100.) Four individuals also challenged Chavous in the Democratic primary: Rev. Robert B. Hunter of Atonement Episcopal Church; Mary D. Jackson, a United States Senate archivist and an ANC member; Durand A. Ford, a financial management consultant; and Gary R. Feenster, a computing analyst. By the end of August, Chavous had raised $6,000 in new contributions, and said he hoped to raise $20,000 more before the general election. Despite these problems, Chavous won the Democratic primary on September 12. He garnered 53 percent of the vote. His closest challenger was Rev. Robert B. Hunter, who received 33 percent of the vote. Chavous' campaign problems eased during the general election. By October 10, he had raised $66,800, and had $14,000 in cash on hand for the remaining three weeks of the general election campaign. Chavous blamed his reduced electoral margin in the primary on \\"lingering anger\\" over the school board reform battle. Chavous won the general election on November 7 with 87 percent of the vote. Write-in Republican candidate Johnnie Scott Rice won 12 percent.; =Third council term= Chavous continued to have a contentious relationship with Mayor Williams in his third term. The Washington Post claimed that Chavous was considering a mayoral run in 2002, and that his battles with Williams were motivated by the search for a campaign issue.; ; His relationship with Harold Brazil also broke down over Brazil's support for Williams. \\"Harold's just become a lapdog,\\" Chavous said. \\"Harold just defends the mayor even when the mayor doesn't ask for support. Frankly, it's more than frustrating.\\" Chavous was vocal on a number of issues in his third council term. He opposed repeal of council members' term limits (approved by voters in 1994), and supported a redistricting plan which expanded Ward 7 west of the Anacostia River (angering residents of Kingman Park, who wished to remain part of Ward 6).; But Peggy Cooper Cafritz, the highly influential president of the new school board, strongly criticized Chavous for failing to secure more funding for public schools, and residents of Ward 7 were so upset with his failure to push for cleanup of abandoned lots that 20 of them dumped trash on Chavous' front lawn in January 2003. Chavous publicly stated he was considering another mayoral run in December 2001. When Mayor Williams apologized publicly for ethical lapses in January 2002, local news media reported that this only boosted Chavous' interest in a campaign. Lingering anger among residents on the east side of the city at the closing of D.C. General Hospital and those who lived in areas unaffected by the city's business resurgence led Chavous to publicly announce he was considering a run. In April 2002, as the filing deadline neared, Chavous admitted he had a growing interest in challenging Williams for the mayor's office Chavous announced in May that he would make a decision by the end of the month, noting that his own poll showed he was \\"very well known and very well respected\\" and that the public held a much less negative view about him than Williams. A damper was put on expectations for a Chavous run in late May when a Post poll showed Chavous losing to Williams, 51 percent to 31 percent. On June 6, Chavous announced he would not run for mayor. When a local court ruled that Williams had not submitted enough valid signatures to put himself on the ballot, Williams announced he would run as a write-in candidate in the Democratic Party primary. There was brief speculation by a number of political observers, The Washington Post said, that Chavous would enter the race. But he did not. The biggest issue of Chavous' third term was school vouchers. Chavous had opposed vouchers in the past, but by February 2003, The Washington Post reported, Chavous was much more interested in providing ways to given parents a choice in whether to send their child to public school, private school, or charter school. Chavous and Mayor Williams met with Secretary of Education Rod Paige on February 6, 2003, to discuss vouchers and other \\"choice\\" programs, during which time Paige pledged a voucher program would not be forced on the city. After the meeting, Chavous said he had not yet decided if he would support vouchers or not. Chavous then began to significantly moderate his criticism of Williams. By March 31, Chavous said that he had come to support vouchers, but only if the program were not forced on the city and only if federal (not city) funds were used to finance the program.; ; ; On February 8, 2003, President George W. Bush announced that he would seek federal legislation to impose a school voucher program on the city. As Bush's proposal was considered by the House of Representatives, Chavous and D.C.'s Delegate to Congress, Eleanor Holmes Norton (a strong opponent of vouchers), blamed one another for a series of snubs, missed meetings, and attacks. By the time the measure moved to the Senate in September, Chavous (along with Mayor Williams and Board President Cafritz) was opposed on the voucher issue by a significant majority of elected officials in the city. The Senate passed the school voucher bill on January 23, 2004, and President Bush signed it into law. The legislation provided for a temporary, five-year experiment under which 1,700 low-income students would received up to $7,500 a year so that they could attend a private school in the city or nearby jurisdictions. Congress provided $14 million for the project. A second major educational issue which arose during Chavous' third term was another round of reform aimed at the D.C. Board of Education. On September 24, 2003, Mayor Williams announced that the city's public school system was so dysfunctional and provided such low-quality education that he was introducing legislation to strip the Board of nearly all its power. Control over the school system would be given to the mayor, who would have the right to hire and fire the superintendent, principals, teachers, and other workers and who would gain significant new powers to reconstitute programs, operations, curriculum, and schools. Although Chavous was working on his own bill to give the Council and mayor more power over the school system, he immediately threw his support behind Williams' plan. But little action on the mayor's plan had been taken by January 2004. Chavous argued that Williams had not been forceful enough in making the case for his proposal, and journalist Craig Timberg linked Chavous' lack of activity on the measure to a reluctance to take on a controversial issue in an election year. (Chavous' own bill was also delayed, and he said it would not be ready until at least March 2004.) Williams said he might seek a third term as mayor merely to fight for his school reform bill, if the council did not act more expeditiously. In February 2004, Chavous announced he no longer supported the mayor's bill. The school district was without a superintendent, and Chavous argued that no individual would want the job if the council was considering such a significant change to the position. He also said that giving the mayor hiring and firing authority over the superintendent would require congressional approval or a voter referendum, and both processes would take too long. Chavous then introduced a bill which largely undid the 2000 reforms. The new bill provided for a nine-member board, with eight elected members (one from each ward) and a president elected citywide. Chavous' committee approved the bill in April 2004 without a hearing.; Although Mayor Williams submitted an altered form of his original proposal two weeks after the defeat, it was rejected in mid-May and the Chavous bill approved by the council in July on a close 7-to-6 vote.; The last major issue of Chavous' third term on the council was funding for Nationals Park. Major League Baseball was willing to move the Montreal Expos to Washington, D.C., which had long sought a major-league baseball franchise, but only if the city built a modern, baseball-only stadium for the team. By early June 2003, most of the District Council opposed the initial financing plan submitted by Williams. Chavous was the lone undecided councilmember. (Harold Brazil was the only supporter.) Chavous supported the stadium plan only after he had lost the September 14 Democratic primary. But he remained largely quiet during council debates, and was still considered a swing vote by November. On November 3, he provided the critical third vote on the council's Economic Development Committee, which approved the stadium deal. Twenty-seven days later, he joined with a narrow majority on the council to win final approval for the project. Chavous twice more voted to approve the stadium financing arrangement in December, when the financing mechanism was amended.; His term in office ended on January 2, 2005, when Gray was sworn in. 2004 failed reelection bid Rumors that Chavous would face significant primary opposition should he run for reelection in 2004 emerged in March 2003. Vincent C. Gray, former director of the D.C. Department of Human Services and the founding director of the D.C. chapter of Covenant House, challenged incumbent Jeri Washington for the chairmanship of the Ward 7 Democrats. Gray easily won, 256 to 134. The Washington Post concluded that the loss reflected discontent with Chavous' tenure in office, and that there was widespread speculation that Gray would challenge Chavous for the Ward 7 council seat the following year. Several of the activists and donors who had backed Anthony Williams in his first race for mayor urged Gray to run against Chavous. Gray launched his campaign to unseat Chavous on May 19, 2004, and began waging what the Post called an \\"aggressive campaign\\". Gray was not Chavous' only challenger. Five other individuals had also filed for the seat (although none of them were expected to impact the race significantly). By the end of June, Gray had raised $1,235 in contributions. By the end of July, Chavous had raised $88,514 (all but $16,259 in May 2004) and had $42,295 on hand. Gray's campaign theme was that Chavous was out of touch with the ward, rarely attending neighborhood events and traveling out of town too frequently. Sam Bost, president of the influential Far Northeast/Southeast Council, announced in mid August that he would no longer support Chavous, and Gray won endorsements from several key organizations and individuals. Chavous argued that working on legislation consumed most of his time, and pointed to the school voucher program and the extensive charter school network in the city as major accomplishments. By August 22, Gray had raised $38,531 for a total of $52,389, while Chavous had raised $110,199 (and had $42,296 on hand). The Chavous campaign received a blow on August 31 when the D.C. Democratic State Committee voted 35-to-3 to endorse Gray in the Ward 7 Democratic primary race. The vote, which The Washington Post called \\"an embarrassment\\" for Chavous, was the first time committee had endorsed a candidate in a primary election. Chavous dismissed the outcome, calling the vote \\"a sham\\". As the primary approached on September 14, the Post called the election the closest since Chavous defeated Crawford in 1992. Voter sentiment seemed to focus on the 2003‚Äì2004 Board of Education reform debate, with voters blaming Chavous for the long debate‚Äîwhich, many said, discouraged the two leading candidates for superintendent to drop out. Gray also hammered Chavous on his support for the federal voucher program, which he claimed took money away from public schools. Chavous argued that he had helped improve the delivery and amount of city services, was critical in winning construction of two new public schools in Ward 7, and that he had brought economic development to the area by shepherding the redevelopment of the Skyland shopping mall. By the end of the primary, Chavous had raised $138,849 in contributions. Chavous lost his bid for reelection after losing the September 14, 2004, Democratic primary to Gray, 50 percent to 34 percent. David Nakamura, reporter for The Washington Post, said that voters were unhappy with city schools, which had not improved despite the reforms Chavous took credit for. The D.C. Office of Campaign Finance began an investigation into the 2004 Chavous Democratic primary campaign. The Washington Post reported that the Chavous campaign failed to file financial reports for October and November and paid three invoices totaling $9,000 when the campaign did not have funds to cover the checks. A creditor then filed a complaint with the D.C. police. The Office of Campaign Finance scheduled a hearing on the alleged campaign violations in November 2004, but Chavous did not appear. In an interview with the Post, Chavous blamed a bank error and his campaign treasurer for the problems. Chavous personally gave one creditor a $5,000 cashier's check to cover a radio ad purchase, and his campaign's field coordinator was paid using $2,000 of Chavous' personal funds and $1,000 of the campaign's funds. National education reform advocacy In 2004, Chavous authored the book Serving Our Children: Charter Schools and the Reform of American Public Education. The following year, he was named a Distinguished Fellow with the Center for Education Reform. Chavous served on the education policy committee of Barack Obama's 2008 election campaign. The same year, he co-founded and was named chairman of the board of directors of Democrats for Education Reform (DFER), a political action committee which supports Democratic candidates for office who support school vouchers,; and with DFER founded the Education Equality Project. He also co-founded in 2008 the nonprofit organization Serving Our Children, which provides grants to teachers for the purchase of classroom supplies. He was also named that year to the board of directors of the Black Alliance for Educational Options, an educational reform group promoting school vouchers and charter schools. He became the group's chairman in 2010. In 2010, Chavous was part of the team formed by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, to develop a school voucher program for New Orleans. The group successfully lobbied the Louisiana State Legislature for passage of the program. Chavous joined the board of directors of the American Federation for Children and the Alliance for School Choice about 2011, organizations co-founded by Republican politician Betsy DeVos. In 2012, he served as executive counsel for the American Federation for Children. Also in 2012, Chavous served as a lobbyist for Intralot, the contractor which provided lottery services to the D.C. Lottery. In October 2017, Chavous was named K12 Inc.'s President of Academics, Policy and Schools. https://marketbrief.edweek.org/marketplace-k-12/k12-inc-taps-school-choice- advocate-kevin-chavous-leadership-post/ Prior to being named president, Chavous served on K12's board of directors. https://marketbrief.edweek.org/marketplace-k-12/k12-inc-taps-school-choice- advocate-kevin-chavous-leadership-post/ Personal life In 1982, Chavous married attorney and law school classmate Beverly Bass. The couple divorced in 2009. They have two sons, Kevin (born 1984) and Eric (born 1990). Chavous lives in Vienna, Virginia with his wife Amber and his stepson, Kalijah Mayfield. Author In 2012, Chavous published his second book, \\"Voices of Determination: Children that Defy the Odds\\". In the book, Chavous shares the stories of ten young people who overcame assorted challenges in order to get their education. In 2016, the book was being developed into a screenplay. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15582159.2014.875419 In the fall of 2016, Chavous released his third book, Building A Learning Culture in America, in which he details how America embraced and cultivated a learning culture in the past, how it lost its way and what we need to do as a nation to regain that learning culture. https://www.aei.org/society-and-culture/what-it- takes-to-build-a-culture-of-learning-in-america/ In 2017, Chavous released his first fiction book, The Plan, a political thriller.

Life He was born on March 6, 1850, in Middleburgh, Schoharie County, New York, the son of Peter S. Danforth, a justice of the New York Supreme Court. He studied law with his father and was admitted to the bar in 1871. On December 17, 1874, he married Ida Prince, and they had a son, Edward Danforth, and a daughter. In 1878, he removed to Bainbridge, N.Y., where his father-in-law was President of the First National Bank. There, Danforth practiced law in partnership with George H. Winsor, and was President of the Corporation of Bainbridge. He was a delegate to the 1880 and 1884, 1888, 1892, 1896, 1900 and 1904 Democratic National Conventions. He was Deputy Treasurer under Lawrence J. Fitzgerald from 1885 to 1889, and was New York State Treasurer from 1890 to 1893, elected in 1889 and 1891. In November 1891, he was a member of the State Board of Canvassers (made up by the Secretary of State, Treasurer, Comptroller, Attorney General and State Engineer), when the electoral fraud in the Dutchess County senatorial election happened by which Governor David B. Hill gained control of the New York State Senate. The Republican candidate Gilbert A. Deane had received 78 votes more than Democrat Edward B. Osborne, but the Board changed 92 votes and declared Osborne elected by a plurality of 14. The New York Supreme Court issued a writ to Danforth, ordering him to certify the election of Deane, but Danforth refused to obey. For this he and the other members of the Board were fined $500 by Justice D. Cady Herrick. The sentence was later upheld by the New York Court of Appeals. In August 1893, it became known that Danforth had received a loan of $50,000 (about seven times the annual salary of the Treasurer) from the Madison Square Bank in New York City in exchange for keeping a large amount of State monies in that bank. Danforth managed to withdraw the State's $250,000 from the bank in the early hours of August 9, the day the bank (of which Fitzgerald was a director) closed. After leaving the Treasury, he resumed the practice of law at New York City. From 1896 to 1898, he was Chairman of the New York State Democratic Committee, and in 1897 campaigned successfully for the election of Alton B. Parker as Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals. In 1898, he ran for Lieutenant Governor of New York with Augustus Van Wyck but they were narrowly defeated by Theodore Roosevelt and Timothy L. Woodruff. He died on January 7, 1906, at his home at 51, East 58th Street in Manhattan, of pneumonia; and was buried at the Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx.ELLIOT (sic) DANFORTH DEAD; ONE POWER IN POLITICS in The New York Times on January 8, 1906 Sources * Bainbridge history 1850 births 1906 deaths Burials at Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx) Deaths from pneumonia Infectious disease deaths in New York (state) New York State Treasurers People from Bainbridge, New York Politicians from New York City People from Middleburgh, New York Lawyers from New York City ","title":"Elliott Danforth"},{"id":"18541423","text":"Leontopodium discolor, known as Ezo-usuyuki-s≈ç or Rebun-usuyuki-s≈ç in Japan, is a species of Edelweiss native to alpine areas of Hokkaid≈ç.

Like many boletes, it stains blue when cut or bruised. It is found in deciduous woodland in autumn. There is some question over its edibility, and it is reportedly of poor quality with a taste of soap. Until 2015, the species was known as Boletus rubellus. Taxonomy Boletus rubellus was one of the pored basidiomycetes to be placed in the genus Xerocomus in the past, and is still regarded as such in some texts. The previously commonly used binomial name Boletus versicolor (Rostk.), published in 1844, is now reduced to synonymy as it postdates the current name by German mycologist Julius Vincenz von Krombholz which dates from 1836. Its present specific epithet ' is Latin for \\"somewhat red\\". The fungus was transferred to the new genus Hortiboletus in 2015, following molecular evidence indicating its genetic dissimilarity to Boletus. Description This mushroom has a cap that is scarlet to raspberry red when young, with a dry velvety texture. The extreme margin often has a pale yellow or white band around it, (as in the photograph on the right) and it discolours darker, and dirtier with age. It is a small bolete, with the cap being rarely over in diameter. The pores are small; pale yellow, and bruise slowly. Sometimes tapering, the stem is slender and long, and may reach . It is lemon yellow at the apex, but red elsewhere, and has a tendency to split or sheer vertically. The flesh is straw-coloured in the cap, and stains slowly blue over the tubes when cut. The flesh of the stem is pale yellow at the apex and yellow further down. At the stem base, the flesh may have a distinct spot of brick-red or orange. The tubes and pores are large and lemon-yellow, and may be greenish tinged when older. The spore print is olive. It smells pleasant, but indistinct, and is said to taste slightly soapy. Conflicting information on pore size in notable publications is a possible indication that there may be more than one species involved, both in Britain and in North America. Boletus campestris is very similar, and Boletus bicolor is almost identical. Neither of these are reported in the British Isles. In Europe, this species is often mistaken for the all too similar Boletus armeniacus which, however, does not show the same red coloration in the stem base. Distribution and habitat Uncommon to rare in Southern England, occurring largely with oak (Quercus). It also appears in Europe, and the Eastern United States. A similar species noted as \\"cf versicolor\\" has been collected from Victoria in southeastern Australia. Edibility It is edible, but often maggoty, and some sources describe the taste as soapy.

The village takes its name from the bridge where the A40 road trunk road crosses the River Cothi. It lies some east of Carmarthen.  Cothi Bridge Show  Cothi Bridge Agricultural Society was established in 1898. The Cothi Bridge Show contains breeders and exhibitors and attracts visitors from a large area. The ladies section of the show was introduced in 1972.History - Hanes - CBS Show  Holy Trinity Church Holy Trinity church Holy Trinity church is almost entirely due to the work of one man, Henry Bath, whose family made a fortune as Cornish tin producers and then, when the tin ran out, exported coal from Swansea and imported copper ore and guano. The coming of the railway to the Tywi Valley had allowed Bath to buy land to build a mansion and commute to Swansea. Alltyferin, a substantial Victorian house, was completed in 1868. An ardent churchman, Bath did not want to enforce English services on the parish church in Llanegwad, but was unwilling for his household to attend services in Welsh . Construction of Holy Trinity church began in 1865, but it was not dedicated until 1878.Works at Church of the Holy Trinity, Pont-ar-gothi, Carmarthenshire in Stained Glass in Wales It is a Grade II* listed building The church was built on land which had belonged to Talley Abbey, half a mile from the mansion and linked to it by a wooden bridge over the Cothi.Pontargothi's 'Painted' Church The bridge was later taken down at the same time as Alltyferin mansion. The architect was Benjamin Bucknall, who was a friend of the Baths and had worked with them on Swansea docks. Bucknall employed his friend Alfred Stansell to paint murals and the interior is richly decorated. Biblical scenes form a frieze and the ceiling and the walls are covered in Gothic patterns. Over the years fumes from a coke heater blackened every surface until the paintings were hardly visible. In 2007 the interior was restored to the original colours. The restoration uncovered a further signature near the roof, \\"\\"Rawlins, Taunton\\"\\", who was presumably an assistant to Stansell. Bath only ever saw the plans of the church, as he died on a voyage home from Chile in 1875 at the age of 54. His nephew, Edward, inherited and continued the work.

The Imperial Russian Army gave up the salient in Galicia and Poland. The Russians' critically under-equipped and (at the points of engagement) outnumbered forces suffered great losses in the Central Powers' July‚ÄìSeptember summer offensive operations, this leading to the Stavka ordering a withdrawal to shorten the front lines and avoid the potential encirclement of large Russian forces in the salient. While the withdrawal itself was relatively well conducted, it was a severe blow to Russian morale. Background During this period, the buildup of forces generally favoured the Central Powers. Four new German armies, the 11th, 12th, Army of the Niemen and Army of the Bug were formed. Given the steady erosion of the Russian armies' combat power due to a poorly administered system of reinforcement, particularly of officers, this dramatically shifted the balance of power in the eastern theatre to the Central powers as 13 Central Powers armies faced nine under-strength Russian armies. Under pressure from the Kaiser, Falkenhayn gave in to Hindenburg and Ludendorff's insistence on an offensive in the region. Although Ludendorff and Austro-Hungarian General Staff Chief Conrad von H√∂tzendorf favored an encirclement operation (attacking the extreme north- east and south-east of the salient), just as the Stavka feared, Falkenhayn vetoed this on the grounds of the Central Powers' logistical limitations which confined them to slow advances along major railway lines. Commanders of the Russian Field Armies in Poland had already worked to persuade the Stavka to order a withdrawal from the salient, but the Stavka had felt unable to take such a bold move due to the political implications. The Stavka also did not permit tactical withdrawals within the salient such as the Second Army's proposal to withdraw behind the Vistula, forcing the field armies to hold tactically disadvantageous or even indefensible positions. Offensive Despite heavy initial resistance, the Gorlice‚ÄìTarn√≥w Offensive of May‚ÄìJune eventually resulted in a series of tactical breakthroughs and Mackensen's armies crossed the San River and re-took the Austro-Hungarian fortress at Przemy≈õl, the Russians leaving the Galician capital of Lvov on 22 June. At this point the Stavka began planning a retreat from the Poland salient as the Russians's forces in southern Poland withdrew northward to a new defensive line anchored on the Vistula river and the fortress of Ivanovgrod. Between 23 and 27 June the Germans established bridgeheads across the Dniester to the south, but were halted by Russian counterattacks from the east in July. More worryingly for the Stavka, the German Tenth and Niemen armies pressed through on the extreme north end of the line in Courland. Although there was nothing worth defending in the area, the Stavka felt pressured to defend it on principle and so created a new army to defend the region. When this army was defeated and pushed back from Courland, the Stavka's over-estimation of the Germans logistical capabilities led to him fearing that these advances could be used as a springboard for further advances. It was feared that further successful advances in the north, combined with a fresh offensive in the south, could lead to the encirclement of the entire Poland-salient. Over- estimation of German naval capabilities also led to fears of an offensive thrust through Pskov to Petrograd with the aid of amphibious landings in the capital itself. Due to heavy losses in the Gorlice‚ÄìTarn√≥w Offensive the Russian Army as a whole was a million combat troops, roughly 30%, short of its nominal strength of 1.8 million combat troops as well as being in an exposed position in the Poland Salient. The Russian field armies at this time were critically short of modern weapons and ammunition of all kinds‚Äîartillery, machine guns, and even rifles. In the words of David Lloyd George, then the British Minister of Munitions, \\"The Russians, with their inferior equipment and serious shell deficiency, were quite unable to reply. Retreat was the only expedient open to them to save their armies from complete destruction.\\"Lloyd George, David. War Memoirs of David Lloyd George. Vol. 1. London: Ivor Nicholson & Watson, 1933. p. 451-52. The obsolescent fortresses of Novogeorgievsk, Ivangorod, Grodno, Osowiec, and Dvinsk, that were on or near the front lines at the time, contained considerable artillery, including some modern types. It was hoped that these could compensate for the temporary weakness of the infantry and render the Ivangorod-Lublin-Che≈Çm line defensible. On 13 July, the Central Powers' armies opened a new offensive across the entire front. By 17 July the forces Gallwitz's forces in the center-north had taken 80% losses, and although they had only been forced back only some , they had to retreat across the Narew to avoid total annihilation. German advances in the far north in Latvia and Lithuania took the fortress of Grodno in a matter of days, when the Stavka had assumed that it could hold for weeks at the least, and with the renewal of Austro-Hungarian attacks in the south the Stavka now believed that the encirclement of the Poland-salient was inevitable without an immediate withdrawal and so ordered the abandonment of the defensive lines along the Narew and Vistula, trusting that the fortresses could cover the retreat of its forces. German cavalry entering Warsaw on August 5, 1915. By 13 July, the entire southern wing had been pushed back another to the Bug River, leaving only a small portion of Congress Poland in Russian hands, anchored on Warsaw and the Ivangorod fortress. On 22 July, armies of Central Powers crossed the Vistula river. In August, the Russian Fourth army left the Ivangorod fortress. With the continuing Russian retreat, Warsaw became isolated, and the German 12th Army (under Gallwitz) seized the opportunity and conquered it on 4‚Äì5 August. Poniatowski Bridge in Warsaw after being blown up by the retreating Russian Army in 1915. New attacks by the German Eighth, Tenth and Twelfth armies moving south out of Prussia soon caused even this front to collapse, sending the entire northern end of the Russian lines streaming backward, eventually forming a line running north‚Äìsouth at about the pre-war eastern Prussian border. The Germans, after having received considerable reinforcements, took Brest-Litovsk on 25 August. On 19 September, Hindenburg's forces captured Vilna. Aftermath With their troops starving and their forces critically under-strength due to battle- casualties and particularly disease, the German advance was halted by Russian counter-attacks in late September. The new frontline ran from the Baltic sea to the Romanian border by way of the Belarusian forests and disease-ridden Pripyet Marshes. The new line was roughly on the line of Riga-Jakobstadt- D√ºnaburg-Baranovichi-Pinsk-Dubno-Ternopil. On 21 August, Tsar Nicholas II took advantage of the Stavka's blunders, in losing so many troops to the Central Powers' summer offensives and then retreating only when it was too late, to effectively neuter its power by removing Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich from his post as its head, taking direct control of the army. =Russian terror and atrocities against civilians= Peasants from a destroyed village in front of a shack constructed from debris, environs of Warsaw, 1915 As the Russian army retreated, the Chief of the General Staff Nikolai Yanushkevich, supported by Grand Duke Nicholas, ordered the army to devastate the border territories and expel the \\"enemy\\" nations within. The Russian authorities launched pogroms against German populations in Russian cities, massacred Jews in their towns and villages and deported 500,000 Jews and 250,000 Germans into the Russian interior. On 11 June, a pogrom began against Germans in Petrograd, with over 500 factories, stores and offices looted and mob violence unleashed against Germans. The Russian military leadership regarded Muslims, Germans and Poles as traitors and spies, while Jews were considered political unreliables.

In the show, it is performed by Rusty, the show's protagonist. Before the song, he has been told by the old steam engine Poppa of a magical locomotive, named the Starlight Express, who will aid him in need. The song has been rewritten in many languages, but has always kept the same title, apart from when the production opened in Mexico, when both the show and the song were renamed Expreso Astral. Music and lyrics The music was written by Andrew Lloyd Webber, in the key of E flat major, modulating to E major at the instrumental. In the Broadway production, Greg Mowry sings the song in the key of G major and modulates to Ab. The lyrics were written by Richard Stilgoe. ::Starlight Express, Starlight Express ::Are you real? Yes or no? ::Starlight Express, Answer me yes! ::I don't want you to go Before the song starts, Poppa and Rusty have the following (sung) conversation; ::Poppa: That's my boy, I knew you's believe. ::Rusty: Poppa, I have to believe. [Poppa Exits] I have no choice... ::Rusty: (Broadway) Poppa, I don't know if I believe. But I'll try, I have to try. The song begins, and the introduction is the main theme played on a harmonica, and this is repeated for the instrumental. =Revision= The song has undergone some revision since the show was premiered in London. The first draft started with the line ::When your goodnights have been said and you are lying in bed' However, the verses were rewritten when the show opened on Broadway, in Germany, Japan and Australia. To fit the new tune, new words were written, starting with: ::When the night is darkest, open up your mind A new middle eight was added as well. When the show was revised in London, both drafts were fused together, with the verses from London and the middle eight from later productions. This draft has become the most popular and well-used. The original London tune has been revived for the revised Bochum production. =Thematic value= The tune to the chorus is used throughout the show, for instance, when Rusty first hears of the Starlight Express; during the 'Starlight Sequence'; and when Rusty triumphs over his challengers (see main article). It is probably meant to show a point where there is a strong development in Rusty's character. Starlight Express Introduction The Starlight Express Introduction was performed on Broadway and in London by Poppa and Belle. In later revisions, it is performed only by Poppa and has been shortened significantly. The number uses the first verse and chorus tunes from the London Production, and is used for the moment when Rusty first hears of the Starlight Express. In the first Bochum version this part was sung by Poppa and Control. ::Starlight Express hears your distress ::He's there, all around ::Starlight Express will answer you \\"yes\\" ::He's waiting to be found!'

It was filmed on locations at two locations in Thousand Oaks, California: Joel McCrea Ranch and nearby Moorpark Road.Schneider, Jerry L. (2016). Western Filming Locations Book 6. CP Entertainment Books. Page 37. . Plot A statue is being dedicated to the late founder of Hoyt City, and reporters from around the country have gathered, speculating that \\"the old lady's going to talk.\\" When the anticipated \\"old lady\\" does not appear at the event, they rush to her home. She is centenarian, Hannah Sempler Hoyt, who lives in an old mansion among the skyscrapers of Hoyt City. As she confronts the press who have barged in, a photographer says, \\"Hold it, Mrs. Hoyt!\\" She replies that her name is Hanna Sempler, and refuses to answer their questions as to whether she and Hoyt had been married, which as another reporter says, would make him a bigamist. The intruders leave, having learned nothing to prove or disprove the many rumors, but Hannah is persuaded to tell her story to a young female biographer who lags behind. She reminisces about her experiences with Ethan Hoyt in the American West. In 1848, a teenaged Hannah Sempler is squired by her wealthy father's associate, Mr. Cadwallader, but she is not interested. Hannah meets and flirts with a young pioneer and dreamer, Ethan Hoyt, who comes to her home seeking financial backing from her father in order to build a city in the western wilderness. Her father rejects Ethan's proposal, stating that it is too risky. Hannah, however, falls in love with the young man, and quite impulsively, they elope and head west. The first years of their marriage are not easy, but the couple are happy. When Ethan loses all his money and possessions in a drunken gambling spree to Steely Edwards, Hannah wins back his losses and befriends Steely, who accompanies the couple to Sacramento, California, where they hope to strike it rich mining. In Sacramento, Hannah and Ethan spend less time together, with Ethan working long hours in the mines. One day, Hannah discovers silver on Ethan's boots, carried from the Virginia City mine where he had been working. Hannah knows she is pregnant, but does not reveal this to Ethan, knowing he would never leave her behind in that condition. Instead she encourages Ethan to go to Virginia City and find his fortune in the silver mines. Thinking Hannah wants him gone so she can be with Steely, Ethan leaves her with no intention of returning. After he leaves for Virginia City, the friendship between Hannah and Steely grows. Steely looks after Hannah and her twin babies. When Sacramento is threatened by torrential flooding, Hannah plans to travel to San Francisco. But knowing that Hannah still loves Ethan, Steely arranges for her to travel by coach to Virginia City to be with her husband‚Äîhe will go to San Francisco alone. As the coach crosses a bridge near Sacramento, the river overflows and washes away the coach and its passengers. Hannah survives, but the babies perish. After burying the twins, and believing that Hannah is also dead, Steely travels to Virginia City to tell Ethan the tragic news. It has been years since they've seen or spoken, and by now Ethan has become a wealthy man. When Steely tells him that Hannah is dead, Ethan shoots him, saying, \\"He killed my wife.\\" Thinking that Hannah and Steely are now dead‚ÄîSteely actually survives the shooting‚ÄîEthan continues his dream of building a great city. Steely returns to Sacramento and discovers that Hannah is still alive. He tells her that Ethan, who believes she is dead, has married another woman. Steely and Hannah move to San Francisco and open a gambling casino. Years later, Hannah's father visits her and urges her to \\"disappear\\" so as not to threaten the political future of Ethan Hoyt, who is now representing her father's railroad interests. Hannah refuses her father's request, and travels to Hoyt City, where she watches Ethan giving a political speech. No longer a champion of the people as he once dreamed of becoming, Ethan is now a man of wealth and power, participating in corrupt practices to achieve private goals. Ethan sees Hannah in the crowd and they meet. She tells him that she had divorced him, knowing his political future would be ruined by scandal if it were known they were still married. She reminds him of the dreamer he once was. He goes off with a renewed idealism, devoting the rest of his life to helping the less fortunate, even at his own expense. The story concludes as it started, with the aged Hannah and the young female biographer discussing Ethan Hoyt, standing beneath the impressive statue. Hannah has been alone for many years now. Steely died in the 1906 San Francisco fire, the same year that Ethan returned to Hoyt City, to die in Hannah's mansion. No one knew why he chose to do this, and for some thirty more years Hannah has remained silent about their marriage. The biographer now realizes the profound role that Hannah played in Ethan's life and success, and in the founding of this now great city. Also aware of Ethan's mythic reputation, she kisses Hannah sweetly, saying, \\"I'm kissing my biography [of Ethan] goodbye.\\" Before Hanna leaves the statue, the old woman tears up the marriage certificate she has kept all these years, saying of his myth, and perhaps their relationship, \\"Forever, Ethan. Now no one can change it. Forever.\\" Cast *Barbara Stanwyck as Hannah Sempler *Joel McCrea as Ethan Hoyt *Brian Donlevy as Steely Edwards *K. T.

The SSA is a procedure for numerically simulating the time evolution of the molecular populations in a chemically reacting system in a way that takes account of the fact that molecules react in whole numbers and in a largely random way. Since the late 1990s, the SSA has been widely used to simulate chemical reactions inside living cells, where the small molecular populations of some reactant species often invalidate the differential equations of traditional deterministic chemical kinetics. Gillespie's original derivation of the SSA began by considering how chemical reactions actually occur in a well-stirred dilute gas. Reasoning from physics (and not by heuristically extrapolating deterministic reaction rates to a stochastic context), he showed that the probability that a specific reaction will occur in the next very small time dt could be written as an explicit function of the current species populations multiplied by dt. From that result he deduced, using only the laws of probability, an exact formula for the joint probability density function p(œÑ,j) of the {time œÑ to the next reaction event} and the {index j of that reaction}. The SSA consists of first generating random values for œÑ and j according to p(œÑ,j), and then actualizing the next reaction accordingly. The generating step of the SSA can be accomplished using any of several different methods, and Gillespie's original paper presented two: the \\"direct method\\", which follows from a straightforward application of the well known Monte Carlo inversion method for generating random numbers; and the \\"first-reaction method\\", which is less straightforward but mathematically equivalent. Later workers derived additional methods for generating random numbers according to Gillespie's function p(œÑ,j) which offer computational advantages in various specific situations. Gillespie's original derivation of the SSA applied only to a well-stirred dilute gas. It was widely assumed/hoped that the SSA would also apply when the reactant molecules are solute molecules in a well-stirred dilute solution, a case more appropriate to cellular chemistry. In fact it does, but that was not definitively established until 2009. The SSA is one component of stochastic chemical kinetics, a field that Gillespie played a major role in developing and clarifying through his later publications. The SSA is physically accurate only for systems that are both dilute and well- mixed in the reactant (solute) molecules. An extension of the SSA which is aimed at circumventing the globally well-mixed requirement is the reaction- diffusion SSA (RD-SSA). It subdivides the system volume into cubic subvolumes or ‚Äúvoxels‚Äù which are small enough that each can be considered well-mixed. Chemical reactions are then considered to occur inside individual voxels and are modeled using the SSA. The diffusion of reactant molecules to adjacent voxels is modeled by special ‚Äúvoxel-hopping‚Äù reactions that accurately simulate the diffusion equation provided the voxels are, again, sufficiently small. But modeling a bimolecular reaction inside a voxel using the SSA‚Äôs reaction probability rate will be physically valid only if the reactant molecules are dilute inside the voxel, and that requires the voxels to be much larger than the reactant molecules. These opposing requirements (smaller vs. larger) on the voxel size for the RD-SSA often cannot be simultaneously met. In such cases, it will be necessary to adopt a much less restrictive simulation strategy that carefully tracks the location of every reactant molecule in the system. An algorithm of that kind was devised in 2014 by Gillespie and co-workers. Called the small-voxel tracking algorithm (SVTA), it subdivides the system volume into voxels that are smaller than the reactant molecules, and hence much smaller than the voxels used in the RD-SSA. Diffusion is therefore modeled much more accurately in the SVTA than in the RD-SSA. But inside such small voxels, the SSA‚Äôs bimolecular reaction probability rate will no longer be physically valid. So the SVTA instead models bimolecular reactions using a novel extension of the diffusional voxel- hopping rule. That extension rectifies the physical incorrectness of the standard diffusion equation on the small space-time scales where collision- induced reactions occur. The SVTA thus eliminates the requirements that the system be dilute and well-mixed, and it does so in a way that has theoretical support in molecular physics. The price for this major gain in robustness and accuracy is a simulation procedure that is more computationally intensive. Details of the SVTA and its justification in physical theory are given in the original paper; however, that paper does not develop a widely applicable, user-friendly software implementation of the SVTA. Gillespie's broader research has produced articles on cloud physics, random variable theory, Brownian motion, Markov process theory, electrical noise, light scattering in aerosols, and quantum mechanics. Education Born in Missouri, Gillespie grew up in Oklahoma where he graduated from Shawnee High School in 1956. In 1960 he received his B.A. (magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa) with a major in physics from Rice University. Gillespie received his Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University in 1968 with a dissertation in experimental elementary particle physics under Aihud Pevsner. Part of his dissertation derived procedures for stochastically simulating high-energy elementary particle reactions using digital computers, and Monte Carlo methodology would play a major role in his later work. During his graduate student years at JHU he was also a Jr. Instructor (1960‚Äì63) and an Instructor (1966-68) in the sophomore General Physics course. Career From 1968 to 1971, Gillespie was a Faculty Research Associate at the University of Maryland College Park's Institute for Molecular Physics. He did research in classical transport theory with Jan Sengers. In 1971 he was also an Instructor in the University's Physics Department. From 1971 to 2001, Gillespie was a civilian scientist at the Naval Weapons Center in China Lake, California. Initially he was a Research Physicist in the Earth and Planetary Sciences Division. There his research in cloud physics led to a procedure for simulating the growth of raindrops in clouds, and that prompted his paper on the SSA. In 1981 he became Head of the Research Department's Applied Mathematics Research Group, and in 1994 he was made a Senior Scientist in the Research Department. He retired from China Lake in 2001. From 2001 to 2015, Gillespie was a private consultant in computational biochemistry, working under contract for various periods of time with the California Institute of Technology, the Molecular Sciences Institute (in Berkeley), the Beckman Institute at Caltech, and the University of California, Santa Barbara. Most of this was in collaboration with the Linda Petzold research group in the Computer Sciences Department of UCSB.

The Fantasia was written in 1852 and premiered in Pest on June 1, 1853, with Hans von B√ºlow as soloist and Ferenc Erkel conducting the orchestra.Walker, 303. Overview During Liszt's lifetime, his Hungarian Rhapsodies were among his most popular works. Because of this popularity, he may have been under pressure to produce versions of them for piano and orchestra. The present work is the only such work that Liszt is known to have produced.Collet, 257. However he may, at the end of his life, have helped his student Sophie Menter with her Concerto in the Hungarian Style (1885), a work which was clearly influenced by the Hungarian Fantasy. A slow introduction by the orchestra is followed by a solo cadenza before proceeding to the main body of the work.Ewen, 519. The bold, marchlike main theme of the work, as in the version for solo piano, is the Hungarian folk song \\"Mohac's Field\\",Collet, 257. with a long-short-short-long rhythm. While much of the piece's thematic material is derived from this song, there is also a section in A minor marked \\"in gypsy style\\" (alla zingarese).Headington, 4. While the Fantasia is in the same style and tradition as the Hungarian Rhapsodies, it differs structurally from them. The Rhapsodies generally present a clear succession of two traditional scales ‚Äî lassan, and friska. These dances are evident in the Fantasia, particularly in the long and brilliant friska section. However, Liszt is freer and wider-ranging in his combination and juxtaposition of material than he usually is in this type of work.[ allmusic.com] Bibliography * ed.

Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. 873 (1975), was the case in which the Supreme Court determined it was a violation of the Fourth Amendment for a roving patrol car to stop a vehicle solely on the basis of the driver appearing to be of Mexican descent. JSTOR A roving patrol car must have articulable facts that allow for an officer to have a reasonable suspicion that the person is carrying illegal aliens beyond their ethnicity. The Court handed down a 9-0 decision that affirmed the Circuit Court's ruling in the case.United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 US 873 ‚Äì Supreme Court 1975 Background As part of normal procedure for the United States Border Patrol in Southern California there was a permanent traffic checkpoint set up Interstate 5 just outside San Clemente, California. On March 11, 1973, the checkpoint had been closed because of inclement weather so the officers sat on the side of the highway in their vehicle with their headlights facing northbound traffic. They pursued a vehicle with three occupants in it, stating later that their only reason for pursuing the vehicle was because of the occupant's apparent Mexican ethnicity. The officers questioned Felix Humberto Brignoni-Ponce and his two passengers about their citizenship and discovered that Brignoni-Ponce's two passengers had entered the country illegally. The officers proceeded to arrest the three individuals. The driver was charged with two counts of knowingly transporting illegal immigrants, a violation of ¬ß 274 (a) (2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 66 Stat. 228 and the two passengers were arrested for entering the country illegally. At the trial for the defendant, he argued that the two passengers should not have to testify because their statements were the result of an illegal seizure, but his motion was denied. The two passengers testified and the defendant was found guilty of both counts. The defendant then appealed the decision saying that because the stop was based solely on the basis of his ethnicity, it was a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. The Fourth Amendment protects a person from unreasonable search and seizures. Border Patrol's argument The Border Patrol derived its power to stop the individuals from two separate laws. The first was Section 287 (a) (1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U. S. C. ¬ß 1357 (a) (1), authorizes any officer or employee of the Immigration and Naturalization Service without a warrant, \\"to interrogate any alien or person believed to be an alien as to his right to be or to remain in the United States.\\" The second was Section 287 (a) (3) of the Act, 8 U. S. C. ¬ß 1357 (a) (3), which authorizes agents, without a warrant, to search cars traveling near the border that are suspected to have or are transporting persons trying to enter the country illegally. From this, they believe that their actions were lawful even if an act of Congress cannot supersede the Constitution. Court's decision The Court held a search and seizure based solely on the \\"appearance of Mexican ancestry\\" violates the Fourth Amendment. Without a reasonable suspicion generated by articulable facts, a police search is illegal. According to the precedent set in Terry v. Ohio and Adams v. Williams, under appropriate circumstances, a roving patrol may perform a limited search and seizure without having probable cause to arrest the person. These circumstances include information that the person may have drugs or weapons, a visual scan of the person's vehicle reveals something suspicious or as in this case a visual reason to believe that the person is carrying illegal aliens into the country. Valid examples of what constitutes as suspicion of carrying illegal aliens include driving a station wagon with fold down seats or spare tires removed to conceal aliens, having a low riding vehicle, having an overly packed vehicle, or driving erratically. Also, the officer's knowledge of the area, experience, and training in dealing with illegal aliens dictates the decision to pursue a search. Thus, an officer must have one of these articulable facts in order stop someone and question their citizenship. However, in this case the defendants were stopped for one reason: solely on the basis of their appeared Mexican ancestry. The court concluded that this reason alone made the stop unreasonable. The lack of articulable facts to generate suspicion that the car was carrying illegal aliens meant that this search was illegal.Northwestern University. \\"Search and Seizure.\\" The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology 66.4 (1975): 439. JSTOR. Web. 8 Oct. 2011 There are millions of people living in the area around San Diego that are naturalized and native-born of Mexico and \\"even in the border area, a small proportion of them are aliens.\\" It is unreasonable to assume that any person who appears Mexican is an illegal alien or could be transporting illegal aliens. To allow such unrestricted roving patrol stops would be to subject all residents of the border area to unreasonable searches and seizures just because of their ethnicity, therefore the stop of the defendant was a violation of the Fourth Amendment and the charges were dropped. History of Felix Humberto Brignoni-Ponce Despite being freed from the charges in this case, Brignoni-Ponce was arrested for carrying illegal aliens five times in fifteen years, spending over three years in jail for his crimes. His last- known arrest was on February 25, 1981, six years after his Supreme Court case was decided, at a San Clemente checkpoint, for smuggling thirteen illegal aliens. Ironically, Brignoni-Ponce was born in Puerto Rico, not of Mexican descent as suspected in his initial stop by the Border Patrol, and is an American citizen. This case's effects on Border Patrol agents have been compared to the effects the Miranda decision had on attorneys and prosecutors.

He is the first Iranian to obtain American citizenship. According to a decree issued by the District Court of the 12th Judicial District of the State of California, he naturalized on May 26, 1875. Early life Hajj Sayyah was born in 1836 in the town of Mahallat, Iran.Mehrbanoo Nasser Deyhim in: An Iranian in Nineteenth Century Europe, The Travel Diaries of H√¢j Sayy√¢h 1859-1877. Translated by Mehrbanoo Nasser Deyhim, Foreword by Peter Avery. Bethesda Maryland, IBEX Publishers 1998. p.15. His studies exposed him at a young age to modern and democratic ideas that were then l spreading throughout parts of the world. The stark difference that he observed between the treatment suffered by most Persia under their autocratic rulers and those ideas he studied inspired him to see the rest of the world. Journey At the age of 23, Hajj Sayyah embarked on a remarkable journey around the globe, and which would last for nearly 18 years. He began his travels by wandering throughout Central Asia and Europe for more than six years. Often, he traveled alone and in poverty.An Iranian in Nineteenth Century Europe, The Travel Diaries of H√¢j Sayy√¢h 1859-1877. Bethesda Maryland, IBEX Publishers 1998. The motivation for his travels was his thirst for knowledge and spiritual strength. He wanted to learn as much as he could about the world and how other people lived to bring those ideas back to Persia. As a result of his observations throughout his travels, he concluded that human beings are supposed to live in reasonably-humane societies and, to enjoy basic human rights. Hajj Sayyah came to the United States through New York City. During his ten-year stay in the country, he met with many prominent personalities such as US President Ulysses Grant on more than one occasion. His travels across the United States eventually took him to San Francisco, where he spent several months. In the course of studying Hajj Sayyah ºs life, Dr. Ali Ferdowsi recently discovered through State Department documents that Hajj Sayyah had become an US citizen on May 26, 1875, the first Iranian to do so.http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hajj-sayyah, Retrieved 2013-11-06. Political activist Upon returning to Persia in July 1877, Hajj Sayyah became politically active and was imprisoned for having instigated a clandestine letter writing campaign to the monarch and clergy regarding the unbearable living conditions in Persia. After his release, fearing further persecution he sought the protection of the US legation in Tehran. That move puzzled many Persians, who wondered why he felt that the US government would protect him. Hajj Sayyah went on to play a major role in the Constitutional Revolution of 1906 in Persia, and he remained active until his death in 1925, at the age of 89.Mehrbanoo Nasser Deyhim in: An Iranian in Nineteenth Century Europe, p.17.

The station opened on 2 June 1890. The main station building is Grade II listed and said to have been designed by Galbraith and Church who were the engineers for the line. The contractors were Pethick and Sons of Plymouth The granite came from Pethwick's Swell Tor quarry, the bricks from the Plymouth Brickworks at Gunnislake and the ironwork from Messrs Mathews and Co at Tavistock Ironworks. The station was closed 6 May 1968. As it continued to be lived in by the former station-master and then his widow until 1999, the buildings have remained remarkably unaltered since its closure. The station building has been restored and converted into three self-catering cottages. The stationmaster's house is being restored as a private dwelling, while the goods yard, now known as Kilworthy Park, houses the offices of West Devon Borough Council. The track bed for about south of Tavistock North station is open to the public as a footpath and nature reserve, and it is possible to walk across the viaducts that overlook the town. The rest of the track bed south of Tavistock is almost intact to Bere Alston, where it joins the present-day Tamar Valley Line. There has been discussion regarding the re- opening of a rail link for a number of years. Engineering assessment has shown that the track bed, and structures such as bridges and tunnels, are in sound condition.

Previous to this time, the regulatory work affecting agriculture was administered by commissions, departments and individuals. The act creating the department brought under one head the administering of all regulatory laws affecting agriculture. Commissions were abolished and all their work turned over to the newly created department.

He prepared for college at Thetford, Vermont, and later graduated at Dartmouth College in 1854. He then entered Union Theological Seminary (1854‚Äì1855) before moving to medicine. In 1859, he graduated at the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City (now a part of Columbia University).Rossiter Johnson & John Howard Brown, The Twentieth Century Biographical Dictionary of Notable Americans, The Biographical Society, 1904. He became one of the most noted surgeons of his day in New York City. During The American Civil War, he became an assistant surgeon for The United States Navy. From 1861 to 1864 he served on the USS Santiago de Cuba. In 1864 he took up medical practice in New York City, where he was attending physician, Northwestern Dispensary, until 1869. Between of leaving Union Theological Seminary and entering the medical profession, he became an instructor at a public school in Cleveland, Ohio. It was there that he met, taught, inspired, and befriended \\"A small Barefoot Boy,\\" William Rockefeller (Brother of John D. Rockefeller). The relationship would endure through the years, and Mason became \\"A Rockefeller Patron\\" toward the advancing of the medical sciences. Mason was also deeply interested in metaphysical speculation and theory. His input would help in the early pioneer development of parapsychology and psychical research. These subjects were published in many books, magazines, and newspaper articles. He is accredited as \\"An Early Father-Pioneer of Parapsychology\\" and advance-supporter of the study of applied therapeutic uses of what is known today as Hypnotherapy. He was a contributing member of The Society for Psychical Research. His main publication was the book Telepathy and the Subliminal Mind (1897), and his work focused on case studies and popularization. His chief contributions to the field are considered to be the latter, in the United States, particularly relating to the work of the Society for Psychical Research and the theories of Frederic William Henry Myers. Much of Mason's research and observations in psychical research would be applied in early ESP, Telepathy, Astral (OOBE) research, and in present-day remote Viewing. The 50th Annual Convention of the Parapsychological Association, September 2007, acclaimed him as an early pioneer in parapsychology and psychical research. He was married first in New York City to Marian Isabelle Goodwin in July 1871, and married second to Charlotte Louise Quick in 1886. After his death the latter used her inheritance to become a leading patron of the Harlem Renaissance.Cary D. Wintz & Paul Finkelman, Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance, Taylor & Francis, 2004, .

Retrieved on August 30, 2020., and his attempt to escape. The film was well received by critics, and was awarded three Amanda Awards in 2006. Synopsis As the movie begins, Andreas Ramsfjell (Trond Fausa Aurv√•g) is underground in a train station watching a couple kiss; however, the kiss lacks any sign of aesthetics - on the contrary, it looks hideous and abominable. Andreas seems to be increasingly unsettled until eventually he steps forward and jumps off the track in front of a subway train and the scene abruptly ends. In the following scene, he is on a bus which lets him off at a deserted gas station in the middle of nowhere. An older man greets Andreas with a welcome sign and escorts him into a car. From here he makes his way into an seemingly ideal city, where he soon finds himself with a corporate job, a furnished apartment and a beautiful girlfriend (Petronella Barker). The seemingly perfect life where everyone's needs are met soon proves to be vacuous. Andreas seems to be the only person in the city capable of experiencing sensation and emotion. The only respite from the emptiness is a meaningless materialism. As the slightly uncomfortable turns into the absurd, Andreas tries to escape, but finds there is no way out of the city. The beginning scene is revealed again in the midst of his misery after he gets his heart broken and he steps out onto the train tracks, only to find that not even suicide is a way out of the perfect city. Eventually he meets Hugo (Per Schaaning), a cleaner who has found a crack in the walls of his basement from which lovely music streams out and children are heard laughing. The two dig frantically, in secret, through the wall and discover it leads into a bright and colorful house, presumably back in the real world. Andreas manages to get his arm into the house and grabs a handful of cake from the table, but both of them are caught and dragged out of the basement. Andreas gets thrown out of the city on the same bus that brought him there. The film ends with a violent ride into a frozen wasteland where the bus leaves Andreas, alone in a snowstorm.

Director Jens Lien tells that he was very affected by Schreiner's script, and that the first time he read it he was unable to sleep. Schreiner and Lien had earlier collaborated on short films, but this was the first feature-length movie they made together. The movie was chosen for the Critics' Week of the Cannes Film Festival, and jury member Christophe Leparc expressed great admiration for the film. The \\"lovely music\\" in the basement is actually a recording made for thereminvox.com by theremin veteran Howard Mossman, who remains uncredited.Mossman's recording on thereminvox.com: \\"Howie Does Sam\\"  Reception  Den brysomme mannen was generally very well received by the Norwegian press. The newspaper Aftenposten awarded five out of six points, calling the movie \\"advanced\\" and filled with literary and filmatic references, yet not without a wider appeal. The television station NRK also ended up on five, calling the film thought-provoking and funny, and \\"very, very good\\". International reviews were good. Steve Rose, writing for The Guardian, gave it three out of five stars. Noting the cultural references to other dystopic works, he complained that the movie failed to get \\"beneath the surface of this shallow parallel reality\\". The A.V. Club's Noel Murray called the movie \\"paced and plotted well throughout\\", though he felt it veered \\"too far into fantasyland\\" towards the end. The film was awarded three Amandas in 2006: for \\"Best Direction\\", \\"Best Screenplay\\" and \\"Best Actor\\" (Aurv√•g). It was also nominated in the categories \\"Best Film\\" and \\"Best Actress\\" (Barker). The movie also won several international awards, including the ACID Award (Agence du Cin√©ma Ind√©pendant pour sa Diffusion) at the Cannes Film Festival, and the Golden Starfish at the Hampton International film festival.  Soundtrack  The film heavily features music by Edvard Grieg. The score is composed by the Norwegian composer Ginge.

She was best known for her portrayal of Edith Miller on both the radio and television runs of Mr. District Attorney.  Early years  Vola was born in Denver, Colorado. Living with an Italian mother and a French father who spoke five languages, she grew up in Denver and was herself fluent in five languages at age 14. She attended a Denver ballet school and studied the violin as a pupil of Hungarian violinist Leopold Auer. She paid for acting lessons by working summer vacations as a grocery store cashier. After appearing in a high school play, she joined a stock company touring in the Denver area. She graduated from a Colorado Springs, Colorado, high school in 1931.  Early career  Vola began a Little Theater, and they presented \\"A Child Is Born\\", a Christmas program, on KVOR in 1931.

It is found in all continents except Antarctica and occurs in a wide variety of habitats and climatic zones. It typically grows on tree trunks, logs, walls, rocks and other surfaces. It prefers acidic environments and is fairly tolerant of pollution. It was formerly used as a filling for pillows and mattresses; the association with sleep is the origin of the genus name Hypnum (from Greek Hypnos). Capsules It is a small to medium-sized moss about 2‚Äì10 cm long. It is pleurocarpous, having prostrate, creeping stems which form smooth, dense mats. The stems are branched and covered in overlapping leaves giving the impression of a cypress tree. The stem leaves are long and thin measuring 1.0-2.1 mm by 0.3-0.6 mm. They are concave and sickle-shaped, tapering towards the tip. The branch leaves are smaller and narrower than those on the stems. The moss produces short, cylindrical and slightly curved capsules which contain the spores. The capsules are 1.7-2.4 mm long and have a lid-like operculum measuring 0.6-0.9 mm. They are borne on reddish-brown stalks which are 1-2.5 cm long. The moss is dioicous, having separate male and female plants.

The labyrinth in autumn. Trinity Square is a public square in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is bounded by the Toronto Eaton Centre, an office building known as Bell Trinity Square, and the Marriott Downtown Eaton Centre Hotel. The square's primary feature is the Anglican Church of the Holy Trinity. The Henry Scadding House and Holy Trinity Rectory are heritage buildings that are also located in the square. It includes a fountain and ornamental pond, and a labyrinth path. Trinity Square's primary street access is via James Street, which extends north from Queen Street between the Eaton Centre and Toronto's Old City Hall, although the square can also be accessed by walkways from Bay Street and Dundas Street, as well as through the Eaton Centre. History The Square was once the Terauley estate of John Simcoe Macaulay (Terauley Cottage), which had been acquired by his father James Macaulay in 1797. Macaulay sold his home and land in 1845, giving land for the construction of the Church of the Holy Trinity. By 1900, the area around the church became the Eaton's Annex. The site of Bell Trinity Square, an office building built in 1982 by John B. Parkin Associates, was once home to the 10 floor Eaton's House Furnishing Building, built in 1919. By the 1970s the Eaton's complex came down after a fire and demolition. The church and square were threatened by demolition to make way for the Toronto Eaton Centre. The parishioners of the church successfully resisted and forced the mall's design to be changed, preserving the church. Protests from Toronto citizens also led to the preservation of Old City Hall south of the square. Design The landscaped square is paved with a combination of granite and precast concrete block pavers arranged in different patterns. Its walkways are lined with densely planted trees. There is a water feature consisting of a tall outlet of water falling from a wall into an ornamental pond. Water also flows through an artificial stream beside the walkway to Bay Street. This walkway is designed with the Church of the Holy Trinity as a terminating vista. It also extends views of the church to Hagerman Street on the north side of Toronto City Hall and to the podium of City Hall itself. At Bay Street, the walkway is flanked by two lanterns mounted on tall columns composed of exposed metal frames, painted blue. The columns are defined by three sections, with the widest at the bottom. They are positioned towards the edges of the walkway to complement and frame the two towers of the Church of the Holy Trinity and to provide a formal entrance to the square. Adjacent to the church is a clock tower similar in scale and construction to the columns at Bay Street. In addition, there are three large colonnade-like structures which serve as an entrance to the Toronto Public Labyrinth. The labyrinth is an ancient symbol dating back more than three thousand years. It is a universal symbol of pilgrimage and of our journey through life. A labyrinth has only one path and, unlike a maze, it has no dead ends. The labyrinth pattern at Trinity Square is based on the eleven-circuit labyrinth constructed at the Chartres Cathedral in France, completed in the 13th century. As many labyrinths are found near the water, this labyrinth is located on the former course of Taddle Creek, a stream that has been buried for more than one hundred and fifty years. The granite blocks that have been set into the paving at the entrance to the labyrinth and the nearby water feature in the square serve as reminders of this buried creek. The labyrinth is oriented in the direction of true north, as indicated by the directional lines created with the granite blocks.

It is led by Music Director Michael Butterman. The Boulder Philharmonic‚Äôs season at Macky Auditorium on the University of Colorado at Boulder campus and other venues includes classical music, pops, school and family concerts, as well as an annual production of The Nutcracker with Boulder Ballet.  History =Precursor Years: 1893-1957= The roots of the Boulder Philharmonic can be traced to 1893 when a small group of Boulder musicians calling themselves the Philharmonic Club started performing an annual concert that gradually grew in popularity. In 1941 the Civic Symphony Orchestra was founded as one phase of a recreational program in a plan adopted by the city council. Hugh McMillen, director of bands at the University of Colorado at Boulder conducted the first free orchestra at Boulder High School auditorium, a tradition that continued in 1943 and 1944. The loss of personnel due to WWII, however, caused the orchestra to disband. =Founding Years: 1957-1972= Violinist Elinor Winchester and volunteer musicians revived the orchestra in March 1957. Thomas Facey, conductor of the Golden Symphony, served as musical director. During this time the orchestra was an ensemble made up of amateurs as well as a few professional musicians from the Boulder-Denver area. In 1958 Facey resigned and Dr. Antonia Brico was named conductor. Pianist, graduate of the University of California Berkeley, and the first woman to conduct the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, Brico saw developments such as the Young Artist Competition in 1959 and the inauguration of the Children‚Äôs Concert in 1960. Brico resigned in 1964 and Ador Toth, CU Boulder associate professor of music and conductor of the university symphony orchestra, was named her successor. Toth requested a leave of absence in 1965 to tour with the Alma Trio, and invited his CU colleague, David Burge, to take over as conductor for the 1965-66 season. Burge was named permanent conductor of the Boulder Philharmonic after his first year. In 1966 the Boulder Philharmonic Guild was founded as an ‚Äúauxiliary dedicated to assisting with the maintenance of the orchestra with service as well as with financial means.‚Äù In 1970 the Jr. Guild was founded, which sponsored a flea market, a spring Philharmonic Ball and Symphony Sunday at which time local downtown merchants shared Christmas sale profits with the orchestra. Aside from a one-year sabbatical to Copenhagen (during which James Stroud took over as conductor), Burge‚Äôs tenure lasted until 1972, when he joined the faculty at the Eastman School of Music. =Lehnert and Kuchar years: 1972-2006= Oswald (Ozzi) Lehnert, violin virtuoso and professor, was named conductor and music director of the Boulder Philharmonic in 1972. Under Lehnert, the Boulder Philharmonic saw many developments, such as new fundraising campaigns, free concert series, and a Tier II status from the Scientific and Cultural Facilities District. Also, during this time the Boulder Phil moved to 2,052-seat Macky Auditorium, the city's premiere concert hall on the University of Colorado Boulder campus. In 1990 the Boulder Arts Academy was founded as a community school under the direction of the Boulder Philharmonic. Theodore Kuchar was named Music Director in 1996, under whose leadership the Boulder Philharmonic Orchestra became a fully professional symphony orchestra. Kuchar also founded the Sinfonia of Colorado, a classical chamber orchestra made up of Philharmonic musicians in 1997. In 1999 the Boulder Philharmonic became a part of an alliance organization called the Peak Association of the Arts, also known as PeakArts, which also included the Boulder Ballet, Sinfonia of Colorado and the Boulder Arts Academy. Guest artists during this time included violinists Itzhak Perlman and Hilary Hahn, and cellist Yo-Yo Ma. In 2001 Robert McAllister was named CEO and president of PeakArts, and in 2003 this association dissolved into two entities: Boulder Arts Academy / Boulder Ballet and the Boulder Philharmonic. Also in 2003, Sue Levine was hired as the executive director of PeakArts. Theodore Kuchar left the organization in 2006. =Michael Butterman: 2007‚ÄìPresent= The Boulder Philharmonic Orchestra celebrated its 50th anniversary with its 2007-2008 season, under the leadership of new Music Director Michael Butterman. Michael Butterman is currently the Music Director for both the Boulder Philharmonic and the Shreveport Symphony Orchestra. He is also on the conducting staff of the Jacksonville Symphony Orchestra and the Principal Conductor for Education and Outreach with the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra. In 2014, it was announced that Butterman's contract had been renewed for five years, through the 2018-19 season. Under Butterman's direction, the Boulder Philharmonic inaugurated a series of Discovery Concerts serving thousands of area elementary school students. Guest artists during his tenure have included violinist Sarah Chang, clarinetist Richard Stoltzman, and the Tak√°cs Quartet, in addition to numerous collaborations with Ars Nova Singers, St. Martin's Chamber Choir, Boulder Chorale, Colorado Shakespeare Festival, Frequent Flyers Aerial Dance, Boulder International Film Festival and others. Together with Executive Director Kevin Shuck, who joined the organization in 2010, Michael Butterman has also led an expansion of the Boulder Philharmonic's regional presence with concerts in Arvada, Denver, Highlands Ranch, Lakewood, Lone Tree and the Vilar Performing Arts Center in Beaver Creek. In May 2015, it was announced that the Boulder Philharmonic Orchestra had been selected as one of four orchestras nationally to perform at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., as part of the inaugural SHIFT Festival in March 2017 showcasing innovation in American orchestras. Later that same year, it was announced that the Boulder Phil was awarded its first federal grant from the National Endowment for the Arts to support the commission of a new work to be premiered as part of this national festival.

Perpetuated by a very successful music video, it became a concert staple that continued throughout Hagar's tours as a member of Van Halen. The song is a reference to the since-repealed National Maximum Speed Law that set speed limits at in the United States. It is the 100th song on VH1's 100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs. Song originMusic video The song's music video was directed by Gil Bettman. The video was shot on location at the Saugus Speedway in Santa Clarita, California. The song's video includes Hagar and his band being chased and jailed by the California Highway Patrol for traffic violations. The video shows Hagar driving a black Ferrari BB512i which is later tuned up by Hagar's mechanic, Claudio Zampolli. Zampolli was driving the Ferrari during the video's opening shot, where the Ferrari fish- tails across the speedway. Hagar claims in the commentary for the video on the DVD, The Long Road to Cabo that he burned out his clutch during the video. Hagar drove a 512, but a 308 was also used. Hagar claims it cost him $5800 to fix. A trial scene is presided over by a judge played in a cameo appearance by John Kalodner. The judge's props were borrowed from director Robert Zemeckis, director of the 1980 film Used Cars. Sets were built and the video was shot during the summer. There was no air conditioning in the jailhouse set, so the cast and crew were hot. The yellow jumpsuit, worn by Hagar in the video, can be seen at the New Orleans Hard Rock Cafe. A stuntman was used for Hagar's stunts. An exploding ramp was used to throw Hagar across the courtroom. Additional placements The song has been a signature track for Hagar during and after his tenure with Van Halen, and is commonly used on TV programs and commercials related to automotive racing. Most recently, the song was featured in a NAPA Auto Parts commercial, where NASCAR drivers Michael Waltrip and teammate Dale Jarrett are asking Hagar to keep the noise down during a recording session; in response, Hagar asked Waltrip if he could drive faster. Waltrip's car number at the time of the 2007 commercial was No. 55 and he had failed to qualify for some races. In 2001, NBC Sports had Hagar record a \\"corrected\\" version titled \\"I Can't Drive 65\\", reflecting the common speed limit on freeways at that time (six years after the National Maximum Speed Law was repealed), for use during Budweiser Pole Award presentations on Winston Cup Series broadcasts on NBC and TNT. It was used from 2001 to 2003 during the broadcasts. The accelerated version of the song was also available as a download for NHL Rivals 2004. In 2011, the song became the opening theme for ESPN's NASCAR coverage for the 2011 season. The song is featured as a playable track in Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades and Guitar Hero Live. \\"I Can't Drive 55\\" was an achievement and Easter egg found in Forza Motorsport 4 for driving a 1984 Ferrari GTO faster than 125 mph, in homage to the 1984 Ferrari BB 512i used in the music video and the \\"Write me up for 125\\" line in the song. The song is featured in R4: Ridge Racer Type 4 US commercial. The song is featured in the 1989 film Back to the Future Part II, when Marty McFly discovers he has returned to an alternate, hellish version of 1985 Hill Valley, replete with strip joints, pawn shops, and in the center of it all, a huge 27-story casino hotel called \\"Biff's Pleasure Paradise\\", featuring villain Biff Tannen's face. The song is featured in the 1985 film Moving Violations when Scott Greeber and Stephanie McCarty borrow a car and go cruising at high speeds. The song is on the soundtracks of NBA 2K18 and Twisted Metal. The song is used in the 2018 film Bumblebee. The song is played when Niklas Kronwall of the Detroit Red Wings and Noah Hanifin of the Calgary Flames score goals at home.

The copper ions are distributed in a complicated manner over interstitial sites with both trigonal as well as distorted tetrahedral coordination and are rather mobile. Therefore, this group of copper sulfides shows ionic conductivity at slightly elevated temperatures. In addition, the majority of its members are semiconductors. Mixed monosulfide and disulfide compounds of copper contain both monosulfide (S2‚àí) as well as disulfide (S2)n‚àí anions. Their crystal structures usually consist of alternating hexagonal layers of monosulfide and disulfide anions with Cu cations in trigonal and tetrahedral interstices. CuS, for example, can be written as Cu3(S2)S. Several nonstoichiometric compounds with Cu:S ratios between 1.0 and 1.4 also contain both monosulfide as well as disulfide ions. Depending on their composition, these copper sulfides are either semiconductors or metallic conductors. At very high pressures, a copper disulfide, CuS2, can be synthesized. Its crystal structure is analogous to that of pyrite, with all sulfur atoms occurring as S-S units. Copper disulfide is a metallic conductor due to the incomplete occupancy of the sulfur p band. Different stoichiometric compositions can be obtained by changing the redox atmosphere of the synthetic environment.[6] Oxidation states of copper and sulfur The bonding in copper sulfides cannot be correctly described in terms of a simple oxidation state formalism because the Cu-S bonds are somewhat covalent rather than ionic in character, and have a high degree of delocalization resulting in complicated electronic band structures. Although many textbooks (e.g.) give the mixed valence formula (Cu+)2(Cu2+)(S2‚àí)(S2)2‚àí for CuS, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic data give strong evidence that, in terms of the simple oxidation state formalism, all the known copper sulfides should be considered as purely monovalent copper compounds, and more appropriate formulae would be (Cu+)3(S2‚àí)(S2)‚àí for CuS, and (Cu+)(S2)‚àí for CuS2, respectively.The valence of copper in sulphides and selenides: An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy study, Folmer J.C.W., Jellinek F., Journal of the Less Common Metals, 76, 1-2, ( 1980), 153-162, The electronic structure of pyrites, particularly CuS2 and Fe1‚àíxCuxSe2: An XPS and M√∂ssbauer study, Folmer J.C.W., Jellinek F., Calis G.H.M, Journal of Solid State Chemistry, 72, 1, (1988),137-144, Siew Wei Goh, Buckley A.N., Lamb R.N: Copper(II) sulfide?, Min.

Lamb R.N., Rosenberg R. A., Moran D., Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, 70, 9, 2006, 2210-2228, Further evidence that the assignment of the so-called \\"valence hole\\" should be to the S2 units in these two formulae is the length of the S-S bonds, which are significantly shorter in CuS (0.207 nm) and CuS2 (0.203 nm) than in the \\"classical\\" disulfide Fe2+(S2)2‚àí (0.218 nm). This bond length difference has been ascribed to the higher bond order in (S-S)‚àí compared to (S-S)2‚àí due to electrons being removed from a œÄ* antibonding orbital. NMR studies on CuS show that there are two distinct species of copper atom, one with a more metallic nature than the other.63Cu NMR studies of copper sulfide Shin-hachiro Saito, Hideki Kishi, Kohji Ni√©, Hisakazu Nakamaru, Fumihiko Wagatsuma, Takeshi Shinohara, Phys. Rev.

It was developed by Austria Metal Works in Brno from their earlier, rejected, 8 cm project. It was a rigid- recoil, smooth-bore, breech-loading design that had to be levered around to aim at new targets. It was very simple in that the shell closed the top of the chamber and was retained by a \\"gripper\\" until the air pressure was deemed sufficient and the gripper was manually released, which fired the weapon. An additional barrel could be fitted to extend the range. A cylinder of compressed air was good for eleven shots. After an evaluation on 23 November 1915 it was deemed superior to the German designs already in service (10.5 cm Luftminenwerfer M 15 and 15 cm Luftminenwerfer M 15 M. E.) in range and accuracy and a batch of 100 mortars and 50,000 bombs was ordered at the beginning of 1916. Some 280 were at the front by the end of 1916 and 930 by the end of 1917. In addition to Austria Metal Works it was produced by Brand & L'Huillier and the machine factory at Brno-K√∂ningsfeld.

Established in 1367, the temple served as a major national temple for the Okinawan kingdom of Ch≈´zan and the unified Ry≈´ky≈´ Kingdom which would follow. It is well known for its associations with Christian missionary Bernard Jean Bettelheim and with the 1853-1854 visits by Commodore Matthew Perry to Okinawa. History The temple was first founded in 1367, by a Japanese monk from Satsuma province by the name of Raij≈´Kerr. p81. and with the patronage of the royal government of Ch≈´zan, as a companion to the Naminoue Shrine already located on the bluff, overlooking the beach and ocean. =Loochoo Naval Mission= Dr. Bettelheim's residence, Loochoo Naval Mission Centuries later, in 1846, the temple was taken over by the doctor and Christian missionary Bernard Jean Bettelheim, who occupied it for seven years, driving off Buddhist worshipers and the temple's rightful occupants. Working as a lay medical missionary under the auspices of the Loochoo Naval Mission, when Bettelheim's ship, HMS Starling, arrived at Naha, the Okinawan port master protested that he should not be allowed to disembark. HMS Starling's captain wished to honor this request, but Bettelheim made his way ashore anyway and ended up being offered shelter in the Gokoku-ji for that night; he would not leave for seven years. Turning away worshipers and monks alike by suggesting that they were trying to observe his wife, Bettelheim boarded up the temple's sanctuary and threw out much of what he called \\"the heathen furniture of idolatry\\".Kerr. p284. The Ryukyuan royal government soon deemed it necessary to keep an eye on Bettelheim, who had become more than a nuisance, and a serious burden upon the local community. A guard post was erected just outside the temple grounds, and a detachment of men was assigned to both watch over the temple and to accompany the missionary as he traveled about the area.Kerr. p285. =Visit of Commodore Perry= When the American Commodore Matthew Perry arrived in 1853, Bettelheim served for a time as translator and intermediary. Over the missionary's objections, the Commodore established an American base within the grounds of the Gokoku-ji, including a fenced-off area for grazing cattle, something which drew strong protest from the Ryukyuan authorities.Kerr. pp319-320. When Perry departed from his second visit to Okinawa a year later (having left and returned once in the interim), he was offered, among other gifts from the Kingdom to the United States, a temple bell from Shuri. This was found to be imperfect, so a bell from the Gokoku-ji was offered instead.Kerr. pp336-7. This bell had been forged in 1456, during the reign of Sh≈ç Taiky≈´. The inscription upon it reads in part \\"May the sound of this bell shatter illusory dreams, perfect the souls of mankind, and enable the King and his subjects to live so virtuously that barbarians will find no occasion to invade the Kingdom.Kerr. p100.\\" It being part of the Bettelheim residence, which had been desecrated and not used as a place of worship for roughly eight years, the Ryukyuan authorities were willing to part with it; Bettelheim likewise expressed in his diary elation at seeing the heathen temple further dismantled.Kerr. p337. Intended by Perry to be installed in or near the Washington Monument then under construction, the associated committee turned down the suggestion, and the bell was instead donated to the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis,Kerr. p337n. where it was kept and rung in celebration of Navy victories in the annual Army‚ÄìNavy football game, until it was finally returned to Japan in 1987.Honan, William. \\"A 1465 Bell, War Booty, To Go Back To Okinawa.\\" New York Times. 6 April 1991.

Bettelheim left Okinawa with Perry, restoring the temple to its proper occupants and purpose. In 1871, a Ryukyuan ship was blown off course by a storm and landed on Taiwan where, following a conflict with local Paiwan aborigines, a number of Okinawans were killed. This became an international incident as Japan and China disagreed over the sovereignty of both Okinawa and Taiwan, and thus over whether China owed any form of restitution to Japan. The remains of the Okinawans killed were said to have been recovered and were buried at the Gokoku-ji, a grand ritual performed for them, who were said to have died in the service of the State.Kerr. p452. Destroyed in the 1945 battle of Okinawa, the temple was rebuilt shortly afterwards and remains operational today.

With a claimed initial construction date of 1666, it is one of the oldest surviving buildings in the Rehoboth area. Description and history The house stands in a rural area of northern Rehoboth, on the south side of Agricultural Avenue east of its junction with Rocky Hill Road. It is a 2-1/2 story, wood-framed house, with a gabled roof, roughly centered chimney, and an ell extending to the right side. It is oriented facing west, and has an asymmetrically arranged six-bay front facade. Its main entrance is in the third bay from the left, sheltered by a small porch with a segmented-arch pediment. The third bay from the right exhibits evidence of once also housing an entrance, but now houses a window. The house has a complex construction history, which may begin as early as 1666, making it one of the oldest houses in the region, and one of the few to survive King Philip's War, which ravaged the area in the 1670s. The property was traditionally owned by Jonathan Bliss, and the southern three bays are said to have been built by him. Architectural evidence suggests that this portion was built before 1740. The northern extension was made in the mid-18th century. The southern ell is a three-bay timber-framed former barn, which also dates to the 18th century.

Founded by Msgr. Jo√£o Scognamiglio Cl√° Dias, the organization is active in 78 countries.  History  The Heralds of the Gospel were founded by Msgr. Jo√£o Scognamiglio Cl√° Dias, EP, who was for many years close to Plinio Corr√™a de Oliveira, whom he considers his mentor, and they also follow the main beliefs of the original Brazilian Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property. The main difference is that they claim to adhere to Vatican Council II and its reforms. They were created on 21 September 1999, and were recognized as an International Association of Pontifical Right by Pope John Paul II on 22 February 2001. Consisting mainly of young people, Heralds of the Gospel is established in 78 countries. Its members practice celibacy and are dedicated to an apostolic life, living in separate houses designated for young men and young women. Their life of recollection, study and prayer alternates with evangelizing activities in dioceses and parishes, with special emphasis placed on the formation of youth. They also have a cooperator branch (formerly called companions in English) for those who cannot dedicate their lives entirely to apostolic works due to their own vocation, whether they are married, single or clerics.San Benedetto in Piscinulaalt=right200px  Spirituality  The spirituality of the Heralds of the Gospel is based on three essential points: the Eucharist, the Virgin Mary and the Pope. These points are represented in the emblem that distinguishes them. The three devotions can be seen in the symbol of the Heralds of the Gospel. Their charism leads them to strive for perfection and for beauty in their daily actions.  Music  Seeing in culture and art efficacious tools of evangelization, the Heralds of the Gospel characteristically place special emphasis on both choral and instrumental music. Hence, the Heralds have formed various choirs and symphonic bands to bring their message of faith, incentive and confidence to today's humanity. The main musical ensemble of these neo- evangelizers ‚Äì the International Choir and Symphonic Band ‚Äì was started in S√£o Paulo with members united from diverse nations. This musical ensemble has traveled to numerous cities in the various continents, giving presentations in churches, auditoriums and stadiums to satisfy peoples' hunger for beauty and spirituality.  Societies of Apostolic Life  San Benedetto in Piscinula Church, in Rome As a further development of the charism, the family of the Heralds of the Gospel has given rise to two societies of apostolic life: *Virgo Flos Carmeli, the priestly branch of the Heralds, was born in 2005 with the ordinations of the first fifteen priests, including the founder of the Heralds of the Gospel. *Regina Virginum, the feminine branch was born later on Christmas of 2005. Both societies received papal approval in 2009, becoming a clerical society of apostolic life of pontifical right and a feminine society of apostolic life of pontifical right, respectively. \\"Arising from within the Heralds of the Gospel, and sharing the same values, the two new societies of apostolic life, however, have distinct natures. Virgo Flos Carmeli ‚Äì \\"Virgin Flower of Carmel\\", in English ‚Äì is characterized as a clerical society, in other words, consisting mainly of priests, while the society of apostolic life Regina Virginum ‚Äì \\"Queen of Virgins\\" ‚Äì is formed by women. According to the Vatican decree, Virgo Flos Carmeli \\"is born amidst a loving and pertinacious catechesis on the Church and the Roman Pontiff, as well as respect for the importance of sacralization, to the greatest extent possible, of the values of temporal life.\\" The decree goes on to state that the society is characterized by the defense of orthodoxy, purity of customs and the spirit of hierarchy, \\"as well as the desire to rekindle in humanity the distinction between good and evil (...).\\" Virgo Flos Carmeli was founded by Msgr. Jo√£o Scognamiglio Cl√° Dias, E.P., founder and president of the Heralds of the Gospel, and was erected by the then Bishop of Avezzano, Italy, the Most Rev. Lucio Angelo Maria Renna, on 15 June 2006. Afterward, the Most Rev. Jos√© Maria Pinheiro, Bishop of Bragan√ßa Paulista, where the Motherhouse of the Society is located, requested Pontifical approval of Virgo Flos Carmeli from the Pope. Regina Virginum, for its part, had its approval signed on 26 April 2009. According to the Vatican decree, the Society of Apostolic Life of Pontifical Right, also founded by Msgr. Jo√£o Scognamiglio Cl√° Dias, \\"arose as an expression of the charism of the Heralds of the Gospel, applied to the specific conditions of feminine life, striving to manifest its own characteristics in a particular way within the secularised world.\\"http://heralds.blog.arautos.org/2009/05/07/virgo-flos-carmeli-and- regina-virginum-the-two-most-recent-societies-of-apostolic-life-approved-by- the-vatican/ Heralds of the Gospel Official Blog  Growth  Our Lady of the Rosary Basilica, Caieiras Our Lady of the Rosary of Fatima Basilica, Embu das Artes The Heralds of the Gospel are growing, expanding their missionary activities to several countries and new cities in recent years. It is one of the fastest growing religious families today. As Pope Benedict XVI said: \\"There are also, however, new Catholic awakenings, a dynamic of new movements, for instance, the \\"Heralds of the Gospel\\", young people who are seized by the enthusiasm of having acknowledged Christ as the Son of God and of bringing him into the world.\\" The first church entrusted to the Heralds was San Benedetto in Piscinula in Rome in 2003 and more have followed, with Our Lady of the Rosary, Caieiras, Brazil, the first honored with the title of minor basilica, in 2012. In 2014 the Heralds church Our Lady of the Rosary of Fatima in Embu das Artes, S√£o Paulo, Brazil, was also named by the Vatican a minor basilica. They also operate several schools and are in partnerships with several other educational institutions, such as the Lumen Veritatis Academy, of noted excellence in academics and Catholic religious education. Many of the Heralds of the Gospel members receive the Sacrament of Holy Orders through the Society of the Apostolic Life of Pontifical Right Virgo Flos Carmeli., which enjoys numerous vocations.  Investigation by the Vatican  In 2017 the Vatican instituted an Apostolic Visitation of the Heralds under the direction of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life. On 12 June 2017 Msgr. Cl√° Dias stepped down as Superior General but continued to be \\"father‚Äù of the Heralds. The visitation found \\"shortcomings concerning the style of government, the life of the members of the Council, the pastoral care of vocations, the formation of new vocations, administration, the management of works and fundraising.\\" As a result of the visitation, Pope Francis appointed Cardinal Raymundo Damasceno Assis, Archbishop Emeritus of Aparecida, as Pontifical Commissioner, to be assisted by Bishop Jos√© Aparecido Gon√ßalves de Almeida and Sister Marian Ambrosio I.D.P. in overseeing the Heralds and its two branches of consecrated men and women. The Heralds are \\"strongly linked to groups in the Church which oppose the reforms of Pope Francis.\\" An element in this investigation was a video presented by Andrea Tornielli, in an article published in the newspaper La Stampa, which showed several members of the Heralds of the Gospel listening to a description of an \\"exorcism\\". \\"In the video, a priest standing next to the founder read several claims made by a demon during an exorcism, claiming that 'the Vatican is mine' and foretelling the death of Pope Francis, causing some in the group, including Cla Dias, to laugh.\\" At that time the Heralds issued a clarification note stating that this was an old video and that the leak had occurred improperly as it was for theological studies. It further clarified that all the appropriate steps had been taken under Canon Law and in light of the Catholic theology.

Main characters=Neil Burnside= Neil D. BurnsideBurnside's middle initial, D., is shown on an envelope in the opening credits sequence which reads, \\"N.D. Burnside, Esq.\\" is a career intelligence officer, Director of Operations (\\"D-Ops\\") of SIS, and a former Sandbagger and Royal Marine commando.Burnside's past as a Royal Marine is mentioned by his former father-in-law, Sir Geoffrey Wellingham, in the pilot episode, \\"First Principles\\". Burnside is devious, manipulative, and by turns dour, brusque, aggressive and independent-minded; this combination of traits frequently puts him in conflict with others. He is fiercely patriotic and devoted to the preservation of Britain's national security and \\"the destruction of the KGB by any means necessary\\", but while the KGB makes life difficult enough, his main source of antagonism throughout the series are people supposedly on his side: superiors in SIS, whom he alternately considers too cautious or too reckless; the self-serving politicians who grant or withhold permission for the covert operations Burnside wants to execute; territory-hungry MI5 officers; and entrenched civil servants. Since becoming D-Ops, Burnside is a teetotaler, choosing to drink Coca-Cola rather than run the risk of having to make difficult professional decisions while under the influence of alcohol. The dedication to his job cost Burnside his marriage some time before the first episode, and he has trouble forming close relationships. Despite his divorce, he remains on close terms with his former father-in-law, Sir Geoffrey Wellingham, the Permanent Undersecretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, which allows him to bypass both the Deputy Chief of SIS and C himself. His one attempt at a serious relationship is with Laura Dickens, a Sandbagger recruit in the first series. Burnside's subsequent attraction to her immediately becomes a source of tension between his usually non-existent personal life and his professional duties; this storyline fuels several episodes, and is resolved in a typically gritty fashion. The series begins six months after Burnside has become Director of Operations, and one running theme is the relatively high casualty rate that his directorate suffers with him in charge. While fiercely protective of his agents, especially from what he views as his superiors' willingness to squander their lives on unwise missions, Burnside is himself willing to use the Sandbaggers as pawns if doing so will protect Britain's national security interests. Burnside is played by Roy Marsden. =Willie Caine= The senior Sandbagger (or \\"Sandbagger One\\") and head of the Special Operations Section, Caine is a former ParatrooperCaine's past as a Paratrooper is mentioned by Burnside's former father-in-law, Sir Geoffrey Wellingham, in the pilot episode, \\"First Principles\\". and according to Burnside, possibly the best operative of his kind in the world. Grounded and straightforward where his boss is not, he is not afraid to speak his mind, but remains steadfastly loyal to Burnside despite the latter's maneuverings. Although he dislikes both violence and guns, he is prepared to use them when necessary. Besides Burnside, Caine is the only character who appears in every episode of the series. The character is played by Ray Lonnen. =Sir James Greenley= The Head of SIS when the series begins, code-named \\"C\\". A diplomat by training, Greenley is treated with suspicion by Burnside when he first becomes \\"C\\". Over the course of the first two series, Burnside comes to both trust and become fond of Greenley, who has the difficult task of balancing political as well as security concerns. Greenley is an almost paternal figure to Burnside, often protecting him from the consequences of his worst instincts and keeping the peace between Burnside and Matthew Peele, the deputy chief. Greenley retires at the end of the second series as a result of angina, and Burnside is disappointed to see him replaced, in \\"Operation Kingmaker,\\" by the less benevolent John Tower Gibbs (Dennis Burgess), who remains C for the rest of the series. Greenley is played by Richard Vernon. =Sir Geoffrey Wellingham= Sir Geoffrey Wellingham, KCMG, DSCSir Geoffrey is shown wearing his KCMG around his neck, and miniature medals of his lesser honours on the lapel of his tailcoat, in episode 1.07, \\"Special Relationship\\" is the Permanent Undersecretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office that oversees SIS. As such, he represents the political side of things and is even more cynical and better-versed in realpolitik than Burnside, who is by no means an idealist. As Burnside's former father-in-law (the show often refers to Burnside's former wife Belinda, who is never seen other than via a photograph in Burnside's home), he is also Burnside's contact within Whitehall, and the two both share information and use each other. This avenue of communication is somewhat outside regular channels, and although it can be a useful one for both Burnside and the SIS, on occasion Burnside's superiors show signs of resenting his relationship with Wellingham. Burnside suggests in one episode that the reason the two get along so well is because Wellingham sees a younger version of himself in Burnside. Despite their relationship, the two men can occasionally become adversaries when their agendas differ. Due to his background, experience, and position, Wellingham can be a formidable opponent for Burnside and reminds him of that more than once. Wellingham appears in all but two episodes in the series and is played by Alan MacNaughtan. =Matthew Peele= The Deputy Head of SIS, the former Head of Hong Kong Station and, like Burnside, a career intelligence officer. Unlike Burnside, however, Peele has little field experience and is more concerned with going by the book, avoiding rocking the political boat, and furthering his own ambitions to higher rank. As a result, Peele often opposes what he sees as Burnside's recklessness, contempt for the proper chain of command, and lack of political tact. He is disliked by his subordinates and considered a tyrant with no opinions of his own, but he is a more complex character than he seems. He proves himself just as committed to the security of Britain as Burnside, in his own way, and their relationship evolves over the course of the series to one of mutual respect (if still antagonistic). Peele appears in all but two episodes and is played by Jerome Willis. =John Tower Gibbs= Introduced in the last episode of the second series (\\"Operation Kingmaker\\"), John Tower Gibbs replaces Sir James Greenley as C and remains in that capacity until the end of the series. Gibbs is a career intelligence officer, former head of the Washington and Bonn Stations and working with the Joint Intelligence Commission when he is appointed C. Unlike his predecessor, Gibbs disapproves of Burnside's methods and is suspicious of the special relationship with the CIA, preferring to see it phased out; for his part, Burnside views Gibbs as a tyrant who will stifle his (Burnside's) ability to run his directorate. They clash throughout the third series, but in one episode where Burnside is on leave and Caine is Acting D-Ops, Caine and Gibbs work very well together. He is played by Dennis Burgess. =Jeff Ross= The head of the CIA's London station, Ross is probably Burnside's closest friend. The two often have lunch and work together to preserve the \\"special relationship\\" between the two intelligence agencies. Ross also takes a keen interest in Burnside's personal life and often urges his friend to actually have one. The close relationship between the two, however, does not prevent Ross from using Burnside and the SIS on at least one occasion. In some episodes, Burnside and Ross are even working at cross-purposes. He is played by Bob Sherman. =Other characters= The junior Sandbaggers in series one are Jake Landy (David Glyder), Alan Denson (Steven Grives), and Laura Dickens (Diane Keen); series two introduces Tom Elliot (David Beames), and Mike Wallace (Michael Cashman); of these, only Wallace survives to the end of the series, while the rest are killed in the field. Burnside's capable and fiercely loyal personal assistant is Diane Lawler (Elizabeth Bennett), who retires and is replaced in \\"Operation Kingmaker\\" by Marianne Straker (Sue Holderness). Karen Milner (Jana Sheldon) is a CIA field officer who reports to Jeff Ross and sometimes works alongside one or more of Burnside's Sandbaggers on assignments; she is only seen in the second series. For the second and first two episodes of the third series, Burnside enjoys a friendly relationship with Edward Tyler (Peter Laird), the SIS Director of Intelligence (D-Int), and considers him to be the finest D-Int he's ever seen. Tyler reveals himself to have been a double agent for 23 years in the third series episode \\"To Hell with Justice,\\" and asks the KGB to lift him in Malta--after leaving a trail for SIS to follow and stop the lift, he commits suicide using a KGB-provided cyanide pill before Burnside can escort him back to the UK. He is replaced as D-Int by the less capable Paul Dalgetty (David Robb), who is rarely seen and has a completely antagonistic relationship with Burnside, openly maneuvering to replace the latter as D-Ops. At the conclusion of the series, Dalgetty remains D-Int.  Bibliography  * Mackintosh, Ian. (1978). The Sandbaggers. Corgi Childrens.

Like many other German actors, he fled when the Nazis came to power. Inspired by his deep hatred of Adolf Hitler and the Nazis, Kosleck made a career in Hollywood playing villainous Nazis in films. While in the United States, he appeared in more than 80 films and television shows in a 46-year span. His icy demeanor and piercing stare on screen made him a popular choice to play Nazi villains. He portrayed Joseph Goebbels, Adolf Hitler's propaganda minister, five times, and also appeared as an SS trooper and a concentration camp officer.\\"Martin Kosleck; Actor, 89\\" New York Times, January 30, 1994, accessed July 22, 2008 Early life Kosleck was born in Barkotzen in Pomerania, Germany, the son of a forester. His family was \\"German-Russian\\". He became interested in acting at an early age. He spent six years in the Max Reinhardt Dramatic School, particularly excelling in Shakespearian roles, and working in revues and musicals in Berlin. At the age of 23, he appeared in his first film, a silent movie directed by Johannes Brandt called Der Fahnentr√§ger von Sedan. Two years later, he appeared in Lupo Pick's Napoleon auf St. Helena. Kosleck appeared in two more films in Germany in 1930, the science- fiction thriller Alraune (his first sound film) and Die Singende Stadt. Hollywood In the early 1930s, Hitler and the Nazi Party were growing in power. Kosleck spoke out against both and decided to leave Germany in 1931 for Britain. The following year, he arrived in New York City and then traveled west to Hollywood. In 1933, when Hitler and the Nazi Party came to power, because of his opposition to the Nazis, Kosleck was placed on the Gestapo list of \\"undesirables\\". He appeared in his first American film Fashions of 1934 starring Bette Davis. However, he found little work in Hollywood, so he returned to New York and the stage. While Kosleck was acting in The Merchant of Venice on Broadway, Anatole Litvak invited him to Hollywood for a role in a Warner Bros. film. The highly controversial Confessions of a Nazi Spy, starring Edward G. Robinson, Francis Lederer, Paul Lukas, and George Sanders, was based on The Nazi Spy Conspiracy in America, a book by Leon Turron, an FBI agent who had uncovered the network of Nazi organizations throughout the United States. Kosleck, in a small role playing Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, revealed a sinister streak of evil that was sought after in wartime movies to come. Many other German actors at the time resented being typecast as Nazis; Kosleck, though, reveled in it as a way to get back at the Nazis. He appeared in numerous anti-Nazi films of the early 1940s: Nurse Edith Cavell, Espionage Agent, Underground, Berlin Correspondent, Bomber's Moon, and Chetniks! The Fighting Guerrillas. However, it was his impression of Goebbels that will remain in the memories of moviegoers, especially in Paramount's 1944 pseudo-documentary The Hitler Gang. With the end of the Second World War, roles as Nazis declined. Kosleck then moved into horror B movies, such as The Frozen Ghost and The Mummy's Curse (both starring Lon Chaney Jr., whom Kosleck disliked intensely), House of Horrors, and She-Wolf of London, starring June Lockhart. The House of Horrors gave him his best-remembered role beyond Goebbels, as an insane sculptor, Marcel De Lange, who saves a monster from drowning and gets revenge by having the monster kill his critics. Television With fewer film opportunities presenting themselves, Kosleck returned to New York City with his wife, the German-born actress Eleonore von Mendelssohn, a great x3 grand daughter of Moses Mendelssohn. Kosleck appeared on Broadway in The Madwoman of Chaillot in the late 1940s and early 1950s. He also appeared on television in episodes of numerous shows. In 1951, he appeared in the \\"I Lift Up My Lamp\\" episode of Hallmark Hall of Fame, a television anthology of plays and books, and episodes of The Motorola Television Hour, where he played Goebbels again, Studio One, Thriller, The Rifleman, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, The Outer Limits, Get Smart, Batman (playing Professor Avery Evans Charm), The Man from U.N.C.L.E., The F.B.I., The Wild Wild West, Mission: Impossible, It Takes a Thief, and Sanford and Son. In 1970, Kosleck played (Gestapo) General Mueller in the television comedy Hogan's Heroes, episode: \\"The Gestapo Takeover\\". He suffered from a heart attack in the 1970s, and thereafter worked only occasionally, mostly in television. During this time, he appeared in Love, American Style; Banacek; and Sanford and Son. In 1980, he appeared in his last film, The Man with Bogart's Face. Aside from acting, Kosleck was an accomplished painter who supported himself through his work as a portrait artist while waiting for a movie role. An impressionist-style portrait-painter, he painted both Bette Davis and Marlene Dietrich. Personal life Kosleck was in a relationship with fellow actor and German emigrant Hans Heinrich von Twardowski from the early 1930s until Twardowski's death in 1958. Their sometimes turbulent relationship is discussed in many letters between Twardowski and his close friend Marlene Dietrich. In 1947, Kosleck married in an unexpected act the German actress Eleonora von Mendelssohn (her only film is Black Hand, 1950), who committed suicide in 1951.\\"Marlenes beste Freundin: Hans Heinrich von Twardowski (5.

It is a two- story wood frame structure, with a stuccoed finish, and a low-pitch hip roof capped by a large square cupola. The main roof has elongated eaves studded with paired brackets, and the cupola roof has a curtain-style valance. The house is three bays wide, with a polygonal bay above the main entrance at the center of the front facade. The bays are demarcated by pilasters, and a single-story porch extends across the width of the front. The porch has a flat roof with bracketed eave, and is extensively decorated with stickwork. A similar porch extends along the side of the rear ell, facing Walnut Street. The house was built in 1869 for Samuel Colby, a manufacturer and retailer of men's and boy's clothing who operated a store in the Union Block in downtown Taunton. It is one of the city's least-altered post-Civil War 19th-century houses, and a particularly distinctive example of high-style Italianate architecture.

The area encompasses a variety of stylish 19th-century houses, as well as two 19th-century industrial buildings, depicting the proximity of wealthy industrial owners and managers to their factories. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Description and history Commonwealth Avenue runs east-west through the Attleborough Falls section of North Attleborough, one of its principal industrial areas in the 19th century, and originally connected the town centers of North Attleborough and Attleboro. Its western portion, between Mt. Hope Street and Robinson Avenue, roughly parallels the Ten Mile River, the power source for the industries during that time. The area has been industrially significant since the early 18th century, when a grist mill was operated near the falls. Industrial activity became more intense in the early 19th century, with the construction of the nation's first button-making factory in 1809, and a number of jewelry-related industries followed. Robinson Avenue and the area just to its west was the site of several early factories. A wood frame factory stands at 35 Robinson Avenue, which was home to the B. S. Freeman Company, a jewelry maker, between 1858 and 1913; it may incorporate elements of an even older building in its rambling structure. A second jewelry factory, at 140 Commonwealth Avenue, was built in 1858 by V. H. Blackington. Both of the owners of these factories lived not far away, Blackington within this district at 172 Commonwealth Avenue, and Freeman lived to the west on Mt. Hope Street, in an area that is part of the Attleborough Falls Historic District. Later factory owners continued this trend, with Samuel Mason, a boxmaker, building a Gothic Revival house at 204 Commonwealth, and jewelry maker Frank Sturdy a Queen Anne Victorian at 234 Commonwealth.

It was very simple in that the shell closed the top of the chamber and was retained by a \\"gripper\\" until the air pressure was deemed sufficient and the gripper was manually released, which fired the weapon. The barrel was fixed at 45¬∞ elevation and range was adjusted by varying the air pressure, but an additional barrel could be fitted to extend the range.

Another 80 were ordered in November 1916. In service it was not as successful as its smaller brother due to its greater weight and much greater requirement for compressed air.

Furthermore, the Honorary Medal is the highest civilian decoration still being awarded for bravery, and is specifically for those who carried out a voluntary act of bravery or self-sacrifice, with an emphasis on charity. The medal can be awarded in gold, silver or bronze. Awarding is on basis by nomination of the Netherlands government and by royal decree. The golden medal has precedence only after the Dutch Cross of Resistance (also a civilian bravery decoration, but not awarded anymore), and the silver and bronze medals have precedence after the Airman's Cross (a military bravery award).  History of the medal  Lieutenant Alexander de Langle was the first person to be rewarded with this medal in 1821 for rescuing a sergeant who was stuck at the bottom of a well. Although this was considered an act of bravery, King William I did not deem it important enough to award the lieutenant the distinguished Military William Order, so instead a new award for bravery was created: the Honorary Medal for Charitable Assistance. The first medal was roundish and showed the portrait of King William I. At the reverse side a laurel wreath was portrayed and some space was reserved for an inscription. The medal was not meant to be worn. The size of the medal was related to the value of the metal used: a diameter of 50, 41 or 35 millimeter for subsequently a bronze, silver or golden medal. In 1825 King William I decided that noble and charitable acts of Dutchmen are awarded by charitable organisations and the acts of foreigners and soldiers by the king himself. In 1837 King William II decided by royal decree that the size of the golden, silver and bronze medals would be all 50 millimeter. Also his portrait was put on the medals. Since 1849 the portrait of King William III was shown on the medals and from 1875 a portrait of the older and bold King William III. When Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont became the queen regent of the Netherlands she decided to put on the medal the portrait of her minor daughter Queen Wilhelmina. In 1897 a new type of medal was created, the medal did get a ribbon to wear and also did get the same shape as the French \\"Medal of Saint Helena\\". Since 1912 the medal has its current shape. The medal is ovally shaped with at the top a stylised royal crown. On the medal a mother with three children is portrayed. The motif is taken from the city hall in Bolsward. At the reverse side the words \\"De koningin aan\\" () and also some space is reserved for an inscription. The medal is worn with an orange ribbon that has a red band in the middle. The medallion is today still award as gold, silver or bronze. By decree on 15 April 1952 it was decided that the golden honorary medal has precedence just below the Dutch Cross of Resistance; herewith the golden Honorary Medal for Charitable Assistance is one of the highest awards in the Netherlands. The silver and bronze honorary medals has lower precedence after the Airman's Cross. Before or since World War II it was common to award the medal to sailors. During World War II the medal was primarily award by the Dutch government in exile to those British sailors who rescued Dutch victims from drowning by a shipwreck. After the war the medal was significantly less awarded. In 1982 a soldier of the Royal Netherlands Air Force received the bronze medal, and in 2005 two silver medals were awarded to rescuers of the Royal Netherlands Sea Rescue Institution. The medal was last awarded to five members of the Search and Rescue squadron 7 of the Royal Netherlands Navy, this because they saved the life of the captain and coxswain of an Iranian container ship. Silver medals were awarded on 29 May 2008 by the then Dutch Minister of Defence Eimert van Middelkoop.

History  These engines were designed by Robert Garbe and built between 1913 and 1921, forming the largest class of state railway locomotives in Germany. The boiler was larger than that of the G 8, and the locomotive was designed to be heavier to haul even the heaviest trains without sanding, due to its higher adhesive weight. Because it had a high axle load, the G 8.1 could however only be used on main lines. In addition to its employment with heavy goods traffic, it was later used for heavy pusher duties as well. A total of 4,958 engines alone were made for the Prussian state railways and, later, the Deutsche Reichsbahn. The Imperial Railways in Alsace- Lorraine were given 137 (see the Alsace-Lorraine G 8.1), 10 went to the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway, 50 to the German military railways in the First World War, 6 or 10 to the Gewerkschaft Deutscher Kaiser coal mine at Duisburg and 185 were sold abroad to Poland, Romania and Sweden). Linke-Hoffman delivered 20 locomotives to the Swedish state railways (SJ) in 1918, as Class G. In 1925 the Reichsbahn took over 3,121 Prussian locomotives as Class 55.25‚Äì56 with operating numbers 55 2501‚Äì5622 (less 55 3367). The twelve Mecklenburg engines (two of which had been bought in 1920 by the Prussian state railways) were incorporated as Class 55.58 with the numbers 55 5801‚Äì5810 and 55 5851‚Äì5852. Included amongst the Prussian locomotives were also the ten G 8.1 from the Imperial Railways in Alsace-Lorraine. In 1935, 43 more locomotives came into the Reichsbahn fleet from the Saarland as numbers 55 5623‚Äì5665, the last of which came originally from the Alsace-Lorraine too. In the Second World War numerous locomotives from Poland and Lithuania were also designated as Class 55 engines. The engines taken over from Belgium were given the numbers 55 5666‚Äì5699. After 1945 the DR in East Germany added a further locomotive from Poland as 55 5898, and several from Belgium and France as 55 7251‚Äì7260 and 55 8170. Between 1934 and 1941 a total of 691 G 8.1s were fitted with a leading axle in order to allow a higher top speed and to reduce the average axle load. The converted locomotives were redesignated as DRG Class 56.2‚Äì8. 55 3345 at the Bochum Dahlhausen Railway Museum More than 1,000 engines remained after the end of the Second World War. In 1968 the DR still had 150 locomotives, and the Deutsche Bundesbahn another 50, which they reclassified as Class 055 from 1968. The last G 8.1 with the DB, number 055 538-3, was taken out of service on 21 December 1972. The vehicles were coupled with Prussian 3 T 16,5, 3 T 20 and 2'2' T 21,5 tenders. Number 55 3345 (ex Cassel 5159) has been preserved. It was built in 1915 by Henschel and is today in the Bochum Dahlhausen Railway Museum.

He is a member of the House of Romanov. The House of Romanov was the former ruling Russian Imperial dynasty. He is also known by the names \\"Rosti\\" and \\"Misha\\". Education Rostislav was educated at Brambletye and Milton Abbey Schools, and at Falmouth University where he graduated with a BA in Fine Art.Rostislav Romanov Work Rostislav is a landscape artist. He is particularly interested in en plein air painting and much of his artwork depicts the Sussex countryside or is inspired by his travels in Russia and elsewhere. He works primarily with oil and creates sculptural, three-dimensional paintings primarily in impasto. His most significant early work uses pastels. Pastels, or watercolours, is also the medium of studies for his more important paintings. His work includes relief printing, and dry-point, and soft ground acid etchings. Exhibitions His first solo exhibition was in 2011 at the Fabrica Gallery, Coupla in Moscow. He has since participated in numerous exhibitions both in the UK and internationally. He has exhibited twice in the A. Kasteev Art Museum in Almaty, Kazakhstan, and participated in exhibitions in Dubai and Monaco. In London he has exhibited twice at the Brick Lane Gallery, London. In May 2018 he has a solo exhibition \\"Way of Life\\" at The C. John Gallery, Mayfair. He is represented by the Maison d'Art Gallery in Monaco , and The Martix System in the U.K.. Birth and family Prince Rostislav Rostislavovich was born in Lake Forest, Illinois, the eldest son and second child of Prince Rostislav Rostislavovich and his second wife, Christia Ipsen, Baroness Ampthill (b. 1949). He has an older sister, Princess Alexandra (b. 1983), and a younger brother, Prince Nikita (b. 1987). From his father's first marriage to Stephena Verdel Cook, he has an older half-sister, Princess Stephena (b. 1963). Prince Rostislav belongs to the Mihailovichi branch of the Romanov family as a male line descendant of Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia, the youngest son of Emperor Nicholas I. He is also a descendant of Emperors Alexander II and Alexander III, being the great grandson of Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia (sister of the last Emperor Nicholas II) and her husband Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia. Prince Rostislav has been a member of the Romanov Family Association since 1985 and was a committee member between 2007 and 2013. As a descendant of the Electress Sophia of Hanover, he is also in the line of succession to the British throne. The Prince lived in Chicago until he was two months old, when his father moved his family to London. The family then moved to the village of Rye in East Sussex, where he spent his teenage years.Royal Bridges Prince Rostislav was educated at Brambletye and Milton Abbey Schools, and at Falmouth University where he read Fine Art. Prince Rostislav visited Russia in 1998 with his parents and siblings to attend the reburial rites of Emperor Nicholas II and his family. Six months later, on 7 January 1999, his father died during the Russian Christmas celebration. Though he had been treated for cancer, some speculate that he contracted a rare illness from the dust at the church where the Imperial funeral was held. The loss of the late Prince's income left his family facing financial difficulties. In order to provide for the family Princess Romanova started a bed and breakfast in an 18th-century mansion in Rye, East Sussex. The house was in a semi-derelict state, though, and in need of renovation. As there was initially no kitchen, the children had to carry buckets of water up to the bathroom in order to wash the dishes in the bathtub. His mother later married David Whitney Erskine Russell, the heir to the title Baron Ampthill. Russian prince On 23 September 2006, Prince Rostislav was a guest at the reburial and memorial service for his great-great grandmother the Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna (born Princess Dagmar of Denmark) at Roskilde Cathedral in Denmark.Reburial He then attended the reburial of his great-great grandmother's remains in Russia, where he announced that he was considering moving to Russia. The Romanov Family Association considers Rostislav to be fourth in line to the throne, but the line of succession is disputed by another branch of the family. Furthermore, the Romanov Family Association has essentially renounced any claims to the Russian throne upon its formation in 1979. In November 2007 Prince Rostislav was featured in a documentary produced by France 3 called \\"Un nom en h√©ritage, les Romanov\\" where he was filmed visiting St. Petersburg the former Imperial capital. In July 2009 accompanying his cousin Prince Dimitri Romanovich, he attended events in St. Petersburg to commemorate the 91st anniversary of the murder of Nicholas II and his family. It was also announced that he was visiting Russia to learn the language. Current life Prince Rostislav is the only descendant of the former ruling Russian Imperial dynasty to have moved back to Russia - in 2009 - where he lived for two years and studied Russian. He currently resides in East Sussex. The late president of the Romanov Family Association, Prince Nicholas, appointed him the official representative of the Association in Russia. Rostislav is currently serving as Vice-President of the Romanov Family Association. In 2010, Prince Rostislav was appointed honorary Director of the Board of Russia's oldest factory, founded by his ancestor Peter the Great: The Petrodvorets Watch Factory ‚Äì Raketa. He was also advisor to the factory's Creative department for a brief time. The Prince no longer has ties to the Raketa company. Prince Rostislav married in October 2019 property consultant Foteini Georganta (born in 1979), of Athens, and they have one son named Rostislav-George (born in September 2013).

It abrogated the Treaty of Relations of 1903.  Overview  The Cuban-American Treaty of Relations of 1934 replaced the Cuban‚ÄìAmerican Treaty of Relations (1903) in which Cuba committed to: # not permit a foreign power to obtain a naval base on the island # not go into excessive debt # grant the US the right to intervene in Cuba for the maintenance of (an adequate) government # approve all prior military actions by the United States # take measures to reduce infectious diseases # determine sovereignty over the Isle of Pines by a later treaty # lease lands for naval stations to the United States The purpose of the 1903 treaty was to force Cuba to agree to recognize all U.S. military during its occupancy as lawful, to allow the U.S. to maintain and be able to quarantine their naval base in times of outbreak, and to allow the U.S. to intervene on behalf of Cuba so that it may preserve Cuban independence. However, the events that transpired in the decades after, such as the overthrow of the standing Cuban government, caused the United States government to re-evaluate and revise the initial treaty, in the form of the Cuban-American Treaty of Relations of 1934. The purpose of this was to maintain that Cuba would agree to recognize all prior U.S. military actions as lawful and allow the U.S. to maintain (Article IV and Article V) and be able to quarantine their naval base but to also nullify the provisions of the 1903 treaty, whereby the involvement of the United States in the affairs of the Cuban government impeded the sovereignty of Cuba. The Cuban government expressed that the presence of a naval base on their island was a cause for concern on behalf of the sovereignty of the country. They argued that the right of the United States to establish naval bases in Cuba was self-granted, being both imposed and maintained by force. In addition, they argued that by being forced to lease and sell land to the United States, the Republic of Cuba was relinquishing territorial sovereignty, and thus the sovereignty of the nation was compromised.US Joint Publications Research Service, 1977, pdf, English translation of 1970 Spanish document \\"Crimes and Provocations\\".  Overthrow of the Cuban Government  The President of Cuba in 1933 was Gerardo Machado. At this time, there was a movement in opposition to Machado, to which he responded by using brutality. U.S. ambassador Benjamin Sumner Welles went to the American Embassy in Havana to advise Machado to restitute the constitutional guarantees. Machado rejected this advice and in the following months a large strike takes place in Havana, and soon spread throughout the entire island. A conspiracy against Machado is discovered within the Cuban army and when Machado attempts to look into it, several officers informed him that unless he resigns, he risks intervention from the United States. Machado resigned and fled the country. Carlos M. C√©spedes took his place as the president. Several weeks later, another uprising takes place, by dissatisfied sergeants lead by Fulgencio Batista. They took control of the island and forced C√©spedes and his cabinet out of the Presidential palace. He was replaced by Ram√≥n Grau San Mart√≠n as the president. The government under Ram√≥n Grau San Mart√≠n was never recognized by the United States, and he was forced to resign in January of 1934. The United States recognized the Cuban government under Carlos Mendieta, when he took the office of President on January 20th of 1934.\\"History of Cuba: 1929 thru 1955\\". Historyofcuba.com.

Most of the articles from the Platt Amendment were done away with. It contained five articles, which were conditions that the government of Cuba agreed to by signing. Article I stated that the Cuban-American Treaty of Relations of 1903 would be abrogated. Article II, carried over from the 1903 treaty, stated that the Cuban government would deem previous military actions of the United States as lawful. Article III, also carried over from the 1903 treaty, stated that the government of Cuba would allow the United States to keep its naval stations, specifically the station in Guantanamo. Article IV stated that the Cuban government would acknowledge the right of the United States to quarantine its naval bases in the instance of the outbreak of disease. Article V stated that both governments agreed to ratify the treaty in Washington as soon as possible.Cuban-American treaty, 1934 ‚Äî (full text) replacing the 1903 treaty The 1934 treaty In 1934, a new Treaty of Relations replaced the 1903 Treaty of Relations. Articles IV and V of the 1903 Treaty were carried forward to the new Treaty: Cuba agreed to continue to recognize as lawful all prior military actions taken by the United States and it was agreed that the base could be quarantined in times of contagion. The lease for the Naval Station, contemplated in article VII of the 1903 Treaty, was recognized as having been agreed to and its provisions continuing. One motivation for the 1934 Treaty of Relations was to remove the irritating provisions of the 1903 Treaty, as part of Franklin Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy. Provisions of the 1903 Treaty were seen to be an affront to Cuban sovereignty.

There are basically two similar models regarding OAI. This model focuses on the priority of the object over the actions (i.e. it emphasizes the object being selected first, and then any action performed on it. OAI adheres to this model.  Action‚Äìobject interface  This model suggests that the user of the interface specify the action before stating what object the action be performed upon. An example of this model can be command-line interface (e.g. \`copy \`, here the action \\"copy\\" is specified prior to the object \\"file\\"). In the present context, the interface design is overwhelmed by GUIs. And hence more concern is given to the visual representation of the user's task objects and actions. It helps to reduces the adverse effect in case the users switch their mind mode from task domain to tool domain. OAI model The OAI model graphically represents the users' workplace using metaphors and let the users perform action(s) on the object. The sequence of work is to first select the object graphically (using mouse or other pointing device), and then performing an action on the selected object. The result/effect of the action is then shown graphically to the user. This way, the user is relieved from memory limitation, and syntactical complexity of the actions. Moreover, it emulates WYSIWYG. This feature of OAI lets the user control their sequence of action and visualize the effects at the runtime. If an action results in an undesired effect, the user simply reverses his sequence of actions. In the action‚Äìobject model, the computer is seen as a tool to perform different action. Whereas in the object‚Äìaction model, the user gains a great sense of control from the feeling of a direct involvement. The computer in this case is seen as a medium through which different tools are represented, which is isomorphic to interacting with objects in the real world. Designing an OAI model starts with examining and understanding the tasks to be performed by the system. The domain of tasks include the universe of objects within which the user works to accomplish a certain goal as well as the domain of all possible actions performed by the user. Once these tasks objects and actions are agreed upon, the designer starts by creating an isomorphic representation of the corresponding interface objects and actions. The figure above shows how the designer maps the objects of the user's world to metaphors and actions to plans. The interface actions are usually performed by pointing device or keyboard and hence have to be visual to the user so that the latter can decompose his plan into steps of actions such as pointing, clicking, dragging, etc. This way DMUIs provide a snapshot of the real world situations and map the natural way of user's work sequence through the interface. This means that the users do not have to memorize the course of actions and it reduces the time required to familiarize themselves with the new model of work. Moreover, it reduces the memory load of the users significantly and therefore enhances the usability. Task hierarchies of objects and actions Tasks are composed of objects and actions at different levels. The positional hierarchy of any object and its related action may not be suitable for every user, but by being comprehensible they provide a great deal of usefulness. = For the user = The most natural way of solving a complex problem is to divide it into sub-problems and then tackle them independently. Then by merging the solutions, a solution for the main problem is reached. This is basically a Divide-and-Conquer approach to problem- solving. This approach is followed in the real world by users when they perform tasks. Each complex task is divided into simple tasks. It is easy to see then, that by managing different levels within a hierarchy, the process is simplified. Through this method, users learn to execute tasks without considering the issues of implementation. = For the designer = Ben Shneiderman suggests the following steps for designers to build a correct task hierarchy: # Know about the users and their tasks (Interviewing users, reading workbooks and taking training sessions) # Generate hierarchies of tasks and objects to model the users' tasks # Design interface objects and actions that metaphorically map to the real world universe Interface hierarchy of objects and actions This hierarchy is similar to that of the task hierarchy and contains: =Interface objects= Users interacting with system build up a basic concept/model of computer related objects like files, buttons, dialog box etc. They also acquire a brief experience of the properties of the objects and how to manipulate the object through its properties. Moreover, they learn how to perform actions on those objects to achieve their computing goals. Hence, a hierarchy of such objects is maintained (which represent the resource of the interface). =Interface actions= This hierarchy consists of decomposed low level units of complex actions that could be performed on objects relevant to the domain of computers as assigned in the interface objects hierarchy. Each level in the hierarchy represent different level of decompositions. A high level plan to create a text file might involve mid- level actions such as creating a file, inserting text and saving that file. The mid-level action of saving a file the file can be decomposed into lower level actions such as storing the file with a backup copy and applying the access control rights. Further lower level actions might involve choosing the name of the file, the folder to save in, dealing with errors such as space shortage and so on. = For the user = There are several ways users learn interface objects and actions such as demonstrations, sessions, or trial and error sessions. When these objects and actions have logical structure that can be related to other familiar task objects and actions, this knowledge becomes stable in the user's memory. = For the designer = The OAI model helps a designer to understand the complex processes that a user has to perform in order to successfully use an interface to perform a certain task. Designers model the interface actions and objects based on familiar example and then fine tune these models to fit the task and the user.

Two collieries were opened here during the Industrial Revolution, the Dunraven Colliery in 1865 and the Glenrhondda Colliery in 1911. Both had closed by 1966 and the sites have since been landscaped, leaving little trace of their industrial past. It is in the historic county of Glamorgan. Location Blaencwm is located in the upper Rhondda Valley about halfway between Treorchy and Hirwaun, and about one mile north of Treherbert. It is served by the A4061 road over Mynydd Ystradffernol.  History  Before the industrialisation of the Rhondda, Blaencwm was a forested agricultural and rural area. There is evidence in the area of Mesolithic and Neolithic human activity, mainly through the discovery of basic hunting, foraging and tool making items.Davis, Paul R. 'Historic Rhondda' Hackman (1989) p. 8 Blaencwm is also the site of three ruinous 16th century hafotai (summer houses ; Welsh language hafod), small agricultural dwellings discovered on the north-east slope of the village. Of all the hafotai discovered in the Rhondda the most important is Lluest discovered in Blaencwm and proof of the agricultural history of the area. In the 19th century with the coming of the Taff Vale Railway, coal mines began opening in the upper Rhondda Fawr. Two mines were sunk in Blaencwm, the first was the Dunraven Colliery opened by Thomas Joseph's Dunraven United Collieries in 1865. The business went in liquidation in 1866 and was taken over by Watts and Company in 1872. Between then and 1913 when it was purchased again, this time by the Cory Brothers, it changed its name to Tydraw Colliery. It closed in 1956. The second colliery, Glenrhondda (known locally as the Hook and Eye due to its reputation for improvisation), was opened in 1911 by Glenavon Garw Collieries. The mine was served by the Rhondda and Swansea Bay Railway which would travel through the Rhondda Tunnel. This pit was closed by the National Coal Board in 1966. The sites of both mines have since been cleared and landscaped to resemble the surrounding area.

Form  The Symphony in C major is in four movements: * I. Sostenuto e maestoso ‚Äì Allegro con brio (475 bars) * II. Andante ma non troppo, un poco maestoso (208 bars) * III. Allegro assai (447 bars) * IV. Allegro molto e vivace. (442 bars). The performance time is approximately 35 minutes. The first movement is in sonata form movement prefaced by a slow introduction. The second movement is in the key of A minor; the overall shape is A + B + B + A + coda, a strong contrast existing between the lyrical A and the signal-like B ideas. The movement begins with a motif from the coda of the first movement. The third movement is a scherzo and trio with the traditional structure A + B + A + B + A + coda. The scherzo is characterised by a dynamic rhythm, whilst the trio (un poco meno allegro) features a contrasting smooth melodic line. The fourth movement is structured in the same classical sonata form as the opening movement. The idea which follows the presentation of the first theme is equivocal in tonality. Wagner accelerates the tempo (pi√π allegro) half way through the coda to generate increased excitement as the music moves towards its close.  Instrumentation  The symphony is scored for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets in C, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns in C, 2 trumpets in C, 3 trombones, timpani and strings.  Composition  According to Wagner himself, in a letter to a friend, he composed the symphony in the brief space of six weeks at the beginning of the summer of 1832. The composition shows the influence of the symphonies of Beethoven (especially nos. 3, 5 and 7) and also of the late symphonies of Mozart.Millington (2001) 309. The orchestration is in the style of Weber. The work shows the composer's inexperience (he was less than 20 years old when writing it), in particular in a so-called diffuseness of the first and second movements.Overbeeke (2012) 6-7. Wagner also started in 1834 an incomplete symphony in E major (WWV35), of which only the first movement and part of the second movement exist.Millington (2001) 310. Early performances The symphony was performed in rehearsal by a student orchestra at the Prague Conservatory in November 1832, conducted by Dionys Weber, with Wagner in attendance. It received its first public performance on 15 December, at the Euterpe music society in Leipzig, conducted by Wagner's early teacher, Christian Gottlieb M√ºller.Deathridge (2008) 180 Clara Wieck described the performance in a letter to her later husband Robert Schumann dated 17 December 1832: The second public performance was at the Leipzig Gewandhaus on 10 January 1833, as part of the annual subscription concerts. The work received another performance at W√ºrzburg on 27 August 1833.Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed., 1954 The score was subsequently thought to have been lost after Wagner presented it to Felix Mendelssohn in 1836 (see below), but the parts from the Prague performance were found in Dresden in 1877 in a trunk which had been left behind by Wagner when he fled the city in 1849. The work was performed again at Christmas 1882, two months before Wagner's death, for the birthday of Wagner's wife Cosima at the La Fenice theatre in Venice; it was conducted by Wagner and by Engelbert Humperdinck.Newman (1976), 96, n. Wagner made several revisions to the full score for the performance.Overbeeke (2012) 7. In a subsequent \\"Essay on the Revival of Youthful Works\\" he wrote: \\"If there is anything at all in this work which shows the mark of Richard Wagner, it is the fact that it is not polluted by the hypocritical stance which was to appear later and which Germans find very difficult to get the better of, and the fact that, from the outset, he remained true to himself and was unwilling to be deflected from his proper course.\\" Mendelssohn and Wagner's Symphony The same 1882 essay contains a passage in which Wagner implies that Mendelssohn had tried to deliberately suppress the Symphony.Cited in Deathridge (2008), 181. The score had in fact been given by Wagner to Mendelssohn as a gift, as is demonstrable from a letter written by Wagner on 11 April 1836; Wagner perhaps had a grievance that Mendelssohn had not subsequently conducted it.Newman (1976), 95 n.2 In 1874 Wagner told Cosima that he thought Mendelssohn had destroyed the score \\"perhaps because he detected in it a talent which was disagreeable to him.\\" This invention was of a piece with Wagner's antisemitic attitude to Mendelssohn.Deathridge (2008), 182-7. Piano duet version Fragments exist of a piano duet version of the Symphony in Wagner's hand, probably prepared in 1832 or 1833. Most of the first movement is in the Stefan Zweig Collection at the British Library; other movements are at the Library of Congress in Washington DC.Searle (1999), 129-30.

The Cathedral Basilica of the Assumption of the Virgin (Spanish: ) is the main church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cusco. The cathedral is located on the Plaza de Armas. The entire building was built between 1560-1654, Adjacent and joined to the cathedral is the smaller Iglesia del Triunfo,Sara Benson, Peru, Lonely Planet, pp 230/231, 6th Edition, 2007. the first Christian church to be built in Cusco. The Iglesia de la Compania de Jesus,Dilwyn Jenkins, Rough Guide to Peru, pp. 254/255, 6th Edition, 2006 also on the Plaza de Armas, was built at a similar time as the cathedral. The Cathedral, in addition to its official status as a place of worship, has become a major repository of Cusco's colonial art. It also holds many archeological artifacts and relics. The cathedral was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site under the City of Cuzco listing in 1983. History=Kiswarkancha= The Incas built the temple known as KiswarkanchaCathedral, A Homage to the Mystical, Magical, most Famous and Oldest City of the American Continent on the main square in Cusco. It was the Inca palace of Viracocha, ruler of the Kingdom of Cusco around a century before the Spanish colonists arrived. The aboriginal name of this city was Qusqu. Although it was used in Quechua, its origin has been found in the Aymara language. The word itself originated in the phrase qusqu wanka (\\"Rock of the owl\\"), attending to the foundational myth of the Ayar siblings.Cerr√≥n-Palomino, Rodolfo (2007). \\"Cuzco: La piedra donde se pos√≥ la lechuza. Historia de un nombre.\\" Andina (Lima) 44: 143‚Äì174. ISSN 0259-9600. Near to the Kiswarkancha was the Suntur Wasi, an armoury and heraldry centre for the Inca royalty. When the Spanish conquistadores arrived in Cuzco, they decided to take down the temple and build their Christian cathedral in that prominent site. =Basilica Cathedral of our Lady of Assumption= The cathedral's construction began in 1559 on the foundations of Kiswarkancha. It is shaped like a Latin cross. The location of Viracocha's palace was chosen for the purpose of removing the Inca religion from Cusco, and replacing it with Spanish Catholic Christianity. Because 1559 was only 26 years after the conquistadores entered Cusco in 1533,Peru, Lonely Planet, Sara Benson, pp 222/223, 6th Edition, 2007 the vast majority of the population was still of Quechua Inca descent. The Spaniards used the Incas as a labour workforce to build the cathedral. The original designs for the large construction were drawn by the Spanish architect and conquistador, Juan Miguel de Veramendi. His design of a Latin cross shape incorporated a three-aisled nave, where the roof was supported by only 14 pillars. Over the 95 years of its construction, the building work was supervised by Spanish priests and architects, until its completion in 1654. Most of the stones from the building were taken from Sacsayhuam√°n, an Inca holy and defensive structure located on the hills above Cusco. Due to its large size, much of Sacsayhuam√°n remains intact. Just as the temple of Viracocha was removed and the holy stones of Sacsayhuam√°n were employed to build the cathedral, the intentional desecration of Inca religious architecture, once the Spaniards learned that the very sand spread on Cusco's main plaza was considered sacred, they removed it and employed it in the cathedral's mortar.Cummins, Thomas (1996). A Tale of Two Cities: Cuzco, Lima, and the Construction of Colonial Representations. In Converging Cultures: Art and Identity in Spanish America. p. 116. Architecture Plan of the cathedral The Gothic-Renaissance style of the cathedral reflects that of Spain during the period of the Spanish conquest of South America and also Cusco.\\"Cathedral of Cuzco\\" , Cusco-Peru There is also evidence of Baroque influence in the facade on the Plaza de Armas. The Incas incorporated some of their religious symbolism into the cathedral, for example, the carved head of a jaguar (an important god or religious motif found widely through much of ancient Peru) is part of the cathedral doors. Artifacts=Cathedral artifacts= Interior of the cathedral Roof of the cathedral There are many Catholic artifacts within the Cusco Cathedral, some of which are fine pieces of colonial craftsmanship. These include the following: *Altar: The cathedral has two altars, the original lambran (alder- tree) at the back, and in front of that, the neoclassical embossed silver altar, which is currently used. The silver altar was originally cedar wood covered in gold flakes, but in 1803 (according to the inscription on the front of the silver panel), Heras Bishop donated the silver to be beaten and applied to the altar. *Maria Angola Bell: The north tower of the cathedral supports the famous Maria Angola, a bell that is 2.15 metres high, and weighs approximately 5980 kg. It was cast in 1659 and named, according to local tradition, after an Angolan slave who threw gold into the crucible where the bell was being made. As the bell is cracked, it is rung only on special occasions. It has been claimed that the bell is audible from more than 20 miles away. *Sacristy: The sacristy, a highly decorated part of the cathedral, displays a large collection of allegoric paintings by Marcos Zapata from the 18th century. Also, many portraits of Cusco's bishops hang in the cathedral, beginning with Vicente de Valverde (see 'artwork'), the first resident bishop of Cusco. Within the sacristy, a large, dark painting of the crucifixion is commonly attributed to the Dutch artist, Anthony van Dyck. Some local guides say it is the work of the Spanish artist Alonso Cano, from the 17th century. *Christ of the Earthquakes: This wooden crucifix is black from centuries of smoke and dust. The Black Christ was not cleaned during restoration of the cathedral interior in the 1990s, when the burning of candles was ended. The crucifix is taken outdoors each year in the Lord of Miracles Procession during Holy Week, the Monday after Palm Sunday, in commemoration of the 1650 earthquake.\\"Peru\\", Reflections Europe =Artwork= Much of the artwork in the cathedral originated from the Escuela Cuzquena (Cusco School of art). This was a school that was built by the Spanish to educate the Incas and their descendants with the methods and disciplines of European renaissance style artwork. This school was famous throughout the colonial Americas, but the Quechua painters were limited to painting scenes of European and Catholic importance. The restrictions imposed on the Inca artists meant that they were not permitted to sign their own artwork, so much of it is unidentifiable. Here is a list of some of the most notable pieces found within the cathedral: *Pintura Senor de los Temblores. The oldest surviving painting in Cusco, which depicts the whole of the ancient city during the 1650 earthquake. Many of the townspeople can be seen carrying a crucifix (see the 'Cathedral Artifacts' section) around the Plaza de Armas, praying for the tremor to end. *Vicente de Valverde. A portrait of the friar who became a bishop at Cusco, after accompanying Francisco Pizarro on his conquests. *Christ's 12 Parables. An incomplete collection of twelve paintings by the Quechuan artist Diego Quispe Tito. There were initially twelve canvases (completed in 1681) to depict the twelve months and zodiac symbols of the year, incorporating the parables of Jesus into the pictures. Iglesia del Triunfo Facade of the Iglesia de El Triunfo (Church of The Triumph) The Church of Triumph, to use its English translation, was built in 1538, just three years after the conquistadores settled in Cusco. It was built over Suntur Wasi, which was an Inca ceremonial building adjoining the palace of Viracocha, in a similar way to the way that the Cathedral is now adjoined to the earlier Iglesia del Triunfo. The name of the Church of Triumph derives from the history of the Spanish settlers in Cusco. At one point, presumably between 1533, and 1536, the Spanish were cornered by a besieging army of Incas, led by Manko Inka. The final stand for the Spanish was in the Suntur Wasi, before its demolition, and just as it seemed that they were on the verge of defeat, the Spanish miraculously managed to drive back the Incas. The Catholic conquistadores attributed this victory to Saint James the Greater (the patron saint of Spain), who was reported at the time to descend from heaven to drive back the Incas. This is why the church is called the Church of Triumph, and also why there is a statue of St. James atop a horse within the Church, depicting him slaying an Inca.

The \\"serious\\" adjective is generally prepended to refer to video games used by industries like defense, education, scientific exploration, health care, emergency management, city planning, engineering, and politics. Serious games are a subgenre of serious storytelling, where storytelling is applied \\"outside the context of entertainment, where the narration progresses as a sequence of patterns impressive in quality ... and is part of a thoughtful progress\\". The idea shares aspects with simulation generally, including flight simulation and medical simulation, but explicitly emphasizes the added pedagogical value of fun and competition. History The use of games in educational circles has been practiced since at least the twentieth century. Use of paper-based educational games became popular in the 1960s and 1970s, but waned under the Back to Basics teaching movement. (The Back to Basics teaching movement is a change in teaching style that started in the 1970s when students were scoring poorly on standardized tests and exploring too many electives. This movement wanted to focus students on reading, writing and arithmetic and intensify the curriculum.\\"Education Update\\"; Back To Basics; Dr. Carole G. Hankin and Randi T. Sachs; 2002) Serious games talk The early 2000s saw a surge in different types of educational games, especially those designed for the younger learner. Many of these games were not computer-based but took on the model of other traditional gaming systems both in the console and hand-held formats. In 1999, LeapFrog Enterprises introduced the LeapPad, which combined an interactive book with a cartridge and allowed kids to play games and interact with a paper-based book. Based on the popularity of traditional hand-held gaming systems like Nintendo's Game Boy, they also introduced their hand-held gaming system called the Leapster in 2003. This system was cartridge-based and integrated arcade‚Äìstyle games with educational content. Also in the 2000s, educational games saw an expanse into sustainable development with titles such as Learning Sustainable Development in 2000 and Climate Challenge in 2006. University institute of Serious Games By 2010, serious games had evolved to incorporate actual economies like Second Life, in which users can create actual businesses that provide virtual commodities and services for Linden dollars, which are exchangeable for US currency. In 2015, Project Discovery was launched as a serious game. Project Discovery was launched as a vehicle by which geneticists and astronomers with the University of Geneva could access the cataloging efforts of the gaming public via a mini-game contained within the Eve Online massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG). Players acting as citizen scientists categorize and assess actual genetic samples or astronomical data. This data was then utilized and warehoused by researchers. Any data flagged as atypical was further investigated by scientists.  Application Areas = Health = On the one hand, the health sector includes digital games for the professional area of doctor training, e.g. to train an operation or to impart specialist knowledge, and on the other hand they address the private end user who uses them, for example, as motivation tools for a healthier lifestyle, nutrition or for rehabilitation purposes. In addition, Serious Games can be used as a training measure for patients who acquire knowledge about their clinical pictures and possible therapy options. On 15 June 2020, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first video game treatment, a game for children aged 8‚Äì12 with certain types of ADHD called EndeavorRx. It can be downloaded with a prescription onto a mobile device, and is intended for use in tandem with other treatments. Patients play it for 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week, over a month-long treatment plan. = Exercise therapy = These include serious games that animate the player to sport and movement. For example, hand-eye coordination and upper body muscles can be trained using Wii Sports, regardless of age and physical disabilities, alone or with others. Even simple Jump-'n'-Run games can have an educational purpose, depending on the user. They are partly used in rehabilitation therapies to restore the user's finger mobility, reaction speed and eye-finger coordination.The Seriousness of Life. = Politics, culture and advertising = Persuasive games are developed for advertisers, policy makers, news organizations and cultural institutions. They are politically and socially motivated games that serve social communication. They cover areas such as politics, religion, environment, urban planning and tourism. The aim is to lead to create a demand for product due to a generated positive exposure to the product in the game or introduce new ways of thinking through experience. See also: business simulation game = Security = Serious games in the field of security are aimed at disaster control, the defense sector and recruitment. Public, private and municipal institutions, such as fire brigades, police, Federal Agency for Technical Relief (Technisches Hilfswerk - Germany THW), DRK as well as crisis centres and NGOs benefit from them. Scenarios such as natural disasters, acts of terrorism, danger prevention and emergency care are simulated. Challenges such as acting under time and pressure to succeed can thus be realistically tested with fewer resources and costs. This area formed the second focal point. An example of serious games from this sector is the Emergency game series or the possibility to explore the response of communities in a game in disaster management. Psychological effect that exist in real life-threatening situation are not realistic in a serious game but the training in a serious game and exposure to the requirements and constraints in disaster management can prepare to a better response of the teams in a real disaster management case and lead to an improved risk mitigation strategies. = Military games = Games like America's Army are training simulations that are used in the training and recruitment of soldiers. The games try to represent warfare as realistically as possible in order to familiarize users with the dangers, strategies, weapons, tactics and vehicles. = Recruitment games = This type of serious games is intended to bring the user closer to tasks that would otherwise be less in the limelight. Companies try to present and profile themselves through such games in order to attract apprentices and applicants. Future tasks will be presented and carried out in a large context, for example \\"TechForce\\", in which various technical areas are combined into an end product with the aim of winning a race. = Product creation games = The aim here is to give the user an understanding of a company's products. The user can test the products in a simulation under real conditions and convince himself of their functionality. Technical basics, handling and security risks can be taught to the user. = Adult education = Real simulations and simulation games provide the user with the opportunity to gain experience. Actions generated from knowledge can be tested here according to the trial and error principle. Theoretical knowledge can either be acquired beforehand or imparted during the game, which can then be tested in a virtual practice. There is an educational policy interest in the professionalisation of such offers. With the research project NetEnquiry, the Federal Ministry of Education and Research supports a corresponding research project for education and training, implemented here with the focus on mobile learning.project page Netenquiry. Website of the project coordinator cevet - centre for vocational education and training. Retrieved 7 November 2013. = Youth education = The user is given tasks and missions that they can only solve with the knowledge that they will gradually discover during the game. The theoretical aspects of the game are always taught in small quantities at the right time to be able to solve the next task and thus test the theoretical approaches in practice. = Art Games = An art game uses the medium of computer games to create interactive and multimedia art. For the first time, the term was described scientifically in 2002 to emphasize games that attach more importance to art than to game mechanics. Mostly they convince by a special aesthetics and atmosphere and use the interactivity for creativity and the thought stimulation of the player. Art created by or through computer games is also called Art Game.

The HCHDS works collaboratively with community-based organizations, historically black colleges, and minority serving institutions to advance knowledge on the causes of health and health care disparities and develop interventions to eliminate them. Specifically, the HCHDS has collaborated with JHU- based organizational entities as well as the National Institute on Aging, Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology of the Gerontology Research Center; Shaw University; Operation Reach Out South West (OROSW); and Nora, LLC. The HCHDS has been designated as a national Comprehensive Center of Excellence in Health Disparities by the NCMHD of the National Institutes of Health, and in 2007 was awarded a second 5-year grant to continue its work. The Center has a national focus although much of the actual work takes place in the local Baltimore, Maryland community. History The Hopkins Center for Health Disparities Solutions was established in October 2002 with a 5-year grant from the National Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities (NCMHD), of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under the Centers of Excellence in Partnerships for Community Outreach, Research on Health Disparities, and Training program (Project EXPORT). Mission \\"Exploration and Intervention for Health Equality...\\" The mission of the Hopkins Center for Health Disparities Solutions is to generate and disseminate knowledge to reduce racial/ethnic and social class disparities in health status and health care through research, training, community partnerships, and advocacy. Research=Exploring Health Disparities in Integrated Communities Study (EHDIC)= This is a large-scale collaborative study consisting of determinants of disparities in chronic conditions. Progress in understanding the nature of health disparities requires data that are race-comparative while overcoming confounding between race, socioeconomic status (SES), and segregation. The EHDIC study is a multi-cohort study that addresses these confounders by examining the nature of health disparities within racially integrated communities without racial disparities in SES. =College Health and Wellness Study= Overweight and obesity is an epidemic in the United States, particularly among minority populations. This epidemic contributes to the development of chronic conditions that occur later in life such as Type 2 diabetes and hypertension. The center conducted a cross- sectional survey among students graduating from a Historically Black College or University (HBCU) in the Mid-Atlantic Region. Participants were 392 predominately African- American seniors graduating in the spring of 2003. Data were collected using a self-administered paper and pencil questionnaire which focuses on weight, weight management activities, weight history, and health status indicators. =Measuring Trust in Health Care= This is a study to examine the validity of the psychometric properties of a new measure of trust or mistrust of medical care systems. Trust is the foundation of the interrelationships that make civil society possible and the importance of trust within healthcare is no less critical. Patients are inherently vulnerable within medical encounters and must be trustful of the multiple institutional entities and individuals involved in their care. Patients must trust that individual healthcare providers are competent and will have their best interest in mind while making treatment decisions. They must trust that the pharmaceutical companies have developed effective drugs and that the regulatory agencies have adequately monitored them. And, they must trust that the healthcare organization and that its staff will manage their medical information with discretion and confidentially. =Environmental Influences on Tobacco Use in Urban Hispanic Young Adults= The Hispanic community in Baltimore City, the Baltimore City Health Department, HCHDS, and other important stakeholders worked together to examine the understanding of contextual factors (i.e., community/neighborhood and societal) that contribute to the high rates of tobacco use in the Hispanic community, with a focus on the population ages 18‚Äì24. =Developing Measures of Parental Knowledge in Physical Activity= Parental knowledge of child health and development issues can have important effects on child health. Greater awareness of the content areas in which parents require more guidance can help clinicians devise parent-centered strategies to reduce identified knowledge deficits and may both increase the quality of care and reduce disparities in child health. The primary goal of this pilot project is to develop a set of parental health knowledge assessment questions relevant to physical activity in children 5 years or younger and to conduct preliminary reliability and validity studies of these questions. Training and education The Kellogg Community Scholars and The Urban Health Institute Fellows are both Postdoctoral training opportunities found at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health that address health disparities-related issues. =Kellogg Community Scholars= The goal of the Community Health Scholars Program (CHSP) is to increase the number of faculty at health professional schools, with an emphasis on schools of public health, who possess the capacity to carry out community-based participatory research and teaching and who understand determinants of community health and how to build the capacity of communities, health-related agencies and academic centers to function as equal partners in community-based research, service and education. =Urban Health Institute Fellows= The goal of the UHI Postdoctoral Research Fellowship program is to promote future leaders in the field of urban health research. The fellows, each working in tandem with a Hopkins faculty member, carry out scholarly research and publication on such issues as crime, unemployment, poverty, substance abuse, diabetes, hypertension and other chronic diseases. =Graduate training opportunities= In addition to offering Doctoral and master's degrees, the Bloomberg School of Public Health also offers certificates of concentration in subspecialties in public health. Thus, a student can obtain a Doctoral or master's degree from any one of the ten departments that comprise the Bloomberg School of Public Health, and also earn an optional certificate in a specialized topic area. The school currently offers certificates in 21 topic areas, including the Certificate Program in Health Disparities and Health Inequality, established by Drs. LaVeist and Gaskin in 2003. The program is open to students enrolled in any graduate degree program at Johns Hopkins University. Tools=Clearview360= Clearview360 offers a suite of survey tools developed by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Our tools provide a 360-degree view of healthcare organizations by assessing patient experience, health literacy, cultural competency, and employee engagement * The Cultural Competency Organizational Assessment (COA360¬∞) * The Patient-Centered Medical Home Assessment (PCMH360¬∞) * The Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) * The Behavioral Health and Social Services Assessment (BHSS360¬∞) * The Cultural Quality Collaborative (CQC) International Conference on Health in the African Diaspora (ICHAD) ICHAD 2012 was an unprecedented gathering of researchers, policymakers, government leaders, health and development advocates, journalists and others concerned about the health of nearly 160 million people of African descent living in the Western Hemisphere. The event will be held July 5‚Äì8, 2012 at the Renaissance Baltimore Harborplace Hotel in Baltimore, Maryland, USA. The conference is organized by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and funded in part by a grant from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation. In 2011, HCHDS established the ICHAD project with a $400,000 grant from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, marking a planned expansion of the HCHDS vision and programs. Journal club Established in Fall 2003, Critical Issues in Health Disparities is a journal club that focuses on health disparities, inequalities and inequities. The aim of the club is to facilitate increased understanding of the issues and controversies relative to these topics by creating opportunities for students, staff and faculty members. *Hear from experts in the field *Engage in discourse with each other *Keep up with the current literature *Develop a community of researchers and scholars The journal club has a strong focus on racial/ethnic health disparities in the U.S. Topics for discussion include: *Conceptualization, definition and measurement of race/ethnicity in public health *How race/ethnicity is used in public health research and application *Intersection of race/ethnicity and other social determinants (e.g., gender, socioeconomic position, discrimination) *Interventions/solutions (design, implementation and evaluation) *Acculturation and immigrant health *Cultural competency *Social justice *Distinction between racial/ethnic disparities in health vs. in health care *Historical perspective of racial/ethnic disparities *Patient/provider interactions Publications * Gibbons, Michael. eHealth Solutions for Healthcare Disparities.

This series saw the show transition to a post- watershed time slot of 9pm, dropping from two episodes to one week-by-week as ITV aimed to save up to ¬£65 million. Producers used the post-watershed slot to introduce \\"darker, more gritty\\" storylines. DI Samantha Nixon left prior to the transition, after seven years on the show, in a special two-parter storyline that included a cameo appearance by her daughter Abigail (Georgia Tennant), who was a recurring character on the show from 2002 to 2005.

They emerged in 1871, after France had ceded the region of Alsace-Lorraine to the German Empire under the terms of the Peace Treaty of Frankfurt following the Franco-Prussian War. The railways of the private Compagnie des chemins de fer de l'Est (CF de l'Est; English: [French] Eastern Railway Company), with a total of trackage, were formally purchased from the French and then sold again to the German Empire. The purchase price of 260 million Goldmarks was counted as compensation for the war. The General Directorate of the Imperial Railways in Alsace-Lorraine (Kaiserliche Generaldirektion der Eisenbahnen in Elsa√ü- Lothringen) had its head office in Stra√üburg (now Strasbourg) and was subordinated directly to the Reich Chancellor. In 1878, however, it was re- subordinated to the newly created Imperial Ministry for the Management of Railways in Alsace-Lorraine in Berlin. The General Division managed six regional operating divisions, which had their headquarters in M√ºlhausen (now Mulhouse), Kolmar (Colmar), Stra√üburg I and II, Saargem√ºnd (now Sarreguemines) and Metz. It was also responsible for a seventh region, with a headquarters in Luxemburg, which ran the operations of the Wilhelm Luxemburg Railway. In the early days, railway vehicles were almost exclusively and forcibly taken from the German railways, because French troops had taken with them almost all rolling stock in the region during the retreat. The French side later built copies of German railway stock, mainly based on Prussian prototypes. Railway operations were carried out, in principle, in accordance with the regulations of the Prussian state railways. Because the CF de l'Est were also the leaseholders of the Wilhelm Luxemburg Railway with a route length of , the Imperial Railways took over the running of the network. An long railway line from Colmar to M√ºnster (French Munster), which belonged to the town of M√ºnster, was also purchased. In the succeeding years the network was expanded significantly. Shortly before the start of the First World War (1912) the Imperial Railway network in Alsace-Lorraine had a total length of , of which was narrow gauge (?). After the end of the war, these railways returned to France. Subsequently, the network of this region was managed independently again as the Administration des chemins de fer d'Alsace et de Lorraine until it merged into the Soci√©t√© nationale des chemins de fer fran√ßais (SNCF) in 1938. In Alsace and Moselle, many multi-track routes are still driven on the right, whereas in the rest of France they drive on the left.

It was produced by Tribune Entertainment and was created by Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert after leaving their show Sneak Previews, which ran on PBS from 1975 to 1982. Background For At the Movies, Siskel and Ebert adopted the same format they had used in their previous series, Sneak Previews: two critics from opposing newspapers view clips from the week's new movies, discuss them, then pass judgment expressed in thumbs up (to approve) or thumbs down (not worth seeing). During this run, they would adopt several elements that would make the show lively. For example, they would bring on an animal called \\"Spot the Wonder Dog\\" to help lead into a segment called \\"The Dog of the Week,\\" covering the week's worst movie. Later, they used another animal, \\"Aroma the Educated Skunk.\\" Siskel and Ebert would also occasionally feature an \\"X-Ray segment,\\" in which they discussed current trends happening in the movies. None of these features were carried over when Siskel and Ebert left Tribune/PBS in 1986 over a contract dispute and created Siskel & Ebert & the Movies with Buena Vista Television, whose title was later shortened to simply Siskel & Ebert. (The show re-adopted the At the Movies portion of the title in 2007.) They were replaced on At the Movies by film critics Rex Reed and Bill Harris, the latter a gossip correspondent for Entertainment Tonight (ET). Under Reed and Harris, the show expanded beyond movie reviews, adding show business news and gossip. Harris left in 1988 and was replaced by former ET host Dixie Whatley.

One specimen, found many years ago, which is in the fish collection at the American Museum of Natural History, was collected near Cocos Island. The Gal√°pagos damsel is a plankton feeder. It has been suggested that global climate change may have influenced the upwelling ecosystem of the eastern tropical Pacific causing the extinction of this damselfish (Jack Stein Grove / Senior Author of FISHES OF THE GALAPAGOS) Possible extinction The El Ni√±o‚ÄìSouthern Oscillation of 1982 and 1983 led to an increase in the water temperature near the Gal√°pagos Islands. Plankton production was reduced for at least one year, leading to drops in the populations of many planktivorous fish, such as the Gal√°pagos damsel. Despite intensive searches during the next decade, it was not seen again.

Bitton was a professor of history at the University of Texas at Austin until 1961 when he started teaching at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He then joined the University of Utah faculty in 1966 where he taught for 29 years until his retirement in 1995. Coming out of retirement, from 2005‚Äì2006 Bitton was a visiting professor at Brigham Young University Hawaii. He was an original member and founder of the Mormon History Association in 1965 and he served as president from 1971‚Äì1972. Bitton served as an official Assistant Church Historian to Leonard J. Arrington from 1972‚Äì1982. Bitton referred to this time as \\"Camelot\\", an exciting time of unprecedented development of new Mormon historical research. Bitton published several works with Arrington. With Arrington's help, Bitton was appointed as a consultant for BYU to the newly created Joseph Fielding Smith Institute with an honorarium of $1,000 per year. However, this position only lasted two years before it was terminated. Bitton married his wife Joan in 1984, and later in life they served together as guides on Temple Square for five years. He died at the age of 77 in Salt Lake City. Awards and honors Davis Bitton has been presented five awards by the MHA. His first award granted by the MHA was in 1975 for the Best Article By A Senior Author for his works Ritualization of Mormon History and The Making of a Community: Blackfoot, Idaho, 1878 to 1910. Two years later he won the Outstanding Bibliography Award for his Guide to Mormon Diaries and Autobiographies. In 1979, Arrington and Bitton were given the MHA Best Book Award for The Mormon Experience: A History of the Latterday Saints. For his biography on George Q. Cannon, Bitton was honored with the MHA Best Book Award in 1999; in 2006, the Mormon History Association awarded Bitton the Leonard J. Arrington Award for \\"distinguished and meritorious service to Mormon history.\\" Although his specialty was French history, Bitton made many contributions to Mormon history. Bitton was given the \\"Silver Award\\" from Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought for an essay on B. H. Roberts. Bitton's biography of George Q.

A PlayStation Portable version was also released in 2008. Gameplay It has several differences from previous titles in the series. The environment has become a modern setting presumably in a fictitious city somewhere in Japan, and instead of being only able to take on the role of a father, the player can now play as a mother or a father. The gameplay has received several major changes as well, including changes to the scheduling of her courses/work, which no longer follows the monthly timeline but follows a more lengthy weekly timeline. More detailed choices are available on how lenient you are on her diet, curfew, allowance and her disposition towards school, people around her, and how she should think. RPG elements have been implemented as well, though nowhere as intensively as Princess Maker 2, the player can now let his/her daughter go explore in the worlds that are parallel to her own. The player in this game is a retired hero of a human realm parallel to the modern world. The daughter is a girl from a royal heritage, and one of many candidates to assume the role of princess. However, following the assassinations of the other candidates, she became the target as well. Her entire family is killed during the attempt on her life.

Discontent among the subjugated Gauls prompted a major uprising amongst the Belgae against Julius Caesar in the winter of 54‚Äì53 BC, when the Eburones of north-eastern Gaul rose in rebellion under their leader Ambiorix. Fifteen Roman cohorts were wiped out at Atuatuca Tungrorum (modern Tongeren in Belgium) and a garrison commanded by Quintus Tullius Cicero narrowly survived after being relieved by Caesar in the nick of time. The rest of 53 BC was occupied with a punitive campaign against the Eburones and their allies, who were said to have been all but exterminated by the Romans. Prelude In 57 BC Julius Caesar conquered Gaul and also Belgica (modernday Northern France, Belgium and a southern section of The Netherlands to the Rhine River; and the north-western portion of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany) In the battle of the Sabis Caesar defeated the Nervii, Viromandui and Atrebates. After this he turned against the Atuatuci, captured their stronghold, and sold the tribe into slavery. The Eburones, who until Caesar's destruction of the Atuatuci were vassals of that Belgic tribe, were ruled by Ambiorix and Catuvolcus. In 54 BC there was a poor harvest, and Caesar, whose practice was to commandeer a part of the food supply from the local tribes, was forced to split his legions up among a larger number of tribes. To the Eburones he sent Quintus Titurius Sabinus and Lucius Aurunculeius Cotta with the command of a recently levied legion from north of the Po and a detachment of five cohorts, a total strength of 9,000 men. The Revolt of the Romans= First Attack and Deception = According to Caesar, Ambiorix and his tribesmen were equal in number of combatants to Sabinus' and Cotta's men. They attacked and killed several Roman soldiers who were foraging for wood in the nearby vicinity. The survivors fled back to their camp, followed by Ambiorix and his men. When the Romans counterattacked, Ambiorix set up a parley with the Romans in which he admitted his debt to Caesar who had taken his side in certain disputes with other Gallic tribes but said that, despite the limited strength of the Eburones, he was compelled to take action by pressure from the other tribes who were determined to win their freedom from the yoke of Rome. He claimed that a huge force of Germans, greatly angered by Caesar‚Äôs successes against them and his defeat of Ariovistus, were about to cross the Rhine and offered to give the Romans safe passage to the fort of either of two nearby legions to better resist this Gallo-German force. = Debate = The Roman representatives, Quintus Junius and Gaius Arpineius, took the news back to the beleaguered fort. A council of war, attended by the leading officers and centurions, was formed. During this council, two opposing opinions took form. Speaking first, Cotta argued that they should not move without an order from Caesar. He pointed out that experience had shown them that Germans could be resisted from behind their fortifications, that they had plenty of supplies, were within easy reach of assistance from nearby legions and that they should not take at face value neither the news nor the advice of an enemy. Denying that he was motivated by fear, Quintus Titurius Sabinus said that he believed that Caesar was on his way to Italy, that the Germans were about to add to the number of the besieging Eburones and that it seemed that they were about the face the combined wrath of grudge-ridden Germans and Gauls‚Äîfor surely the militarily weak Eburones would not dare to face a Roman legion otherwise. Moreover, he said it would be better to make for a nearby legion and face the trouble with their comrades than to risk famine through a prolonged siege. The officers told their commanders that whichever view prevailed was not as important as coming to a unanimous decision. Cotta was finally forced to give way and Sabinus prevailed. = Roman Defeat = The Romans spent the night in disarray, putting together their belongings and preparing to march out of the fort once morning came. The enemy heard the hubbub in the Fort and prepared an ambush. When dawn broke, the Romans, in marching order (long columns of soldiers with each unit following the other), more heavily burdened than usual left the Fort. When the greater part of the column had entered a ravine, the Gauls assaulted them from either side and sought to harry the rearguard and prevent the vanguard from leaving the ravine. Caesar notes that Sabinus lost his mind, running from cohort to cohort and issuing ineffectual orders. Cotta, by contrast, kept his cool and did his duty as a commander, in action his duty as a soldier. Due to the length of the column, the commanders could not issue orders efficiently so they passed word along the line to the units to form into a square. The troops fought bravely though with fear and in clashes were successful. Thus, Ambiorix ordered his men to discharge their spears into the troops, to fall back if attacked by a group of Romans and chase back the Romans when they tried to fall into rank. During the engagement, Cotta was hit full in the face by a sling-shot. Then Sabinus sent word to Ambiorix to treat for surrender, a proposal which was acceded to. Cotta refused to come to terms and remained steadfast in his refusal to surrender, while Sabinus followed through with his plan to surrender. However, Ambiorix, after promising Sabinus his life and the safety of his troops, distracted him with a long speech, all the while slowly surrounding him and his men and slaughtering them. The Gauls then charged down en masse onto the waiting Romans where they killed Cotta, still fighting, and the great majority of the troops. The remainder fell back to the fort where, despairing of help, they killed each other. Only a few men slipped away to inform Titus Labienus of the disaster. Overall, one legion and 5 cohorts, around 7500 Romans, were killed in the battle. Gallic casualties are unknown. Aftermath Statue of Ambiorix in Tongeren (a fanciful interpretation, rather than an archaeological reconstruction, of his possible appearance) After defeating Cotta and Sabinus, Ambiorix tried to raise a general revolt in Belgica. A Belgic attack on Quintus Tullius Cicero (younger brother of the orator Cicero), then stationed with a legion in the territory of the Nervii, led to a siege of the Roman camp during which Ambiorix unsuccessfully tried to repeat his earlier bluff. The attack ultimately failed due to the timely appearance of Caesar. Titus Labienus, the commander of the Fourth legion, which was stationed in the southern Ardennes, discovered that Indutiomarus and the Treveri were rebelling as well. The Treverian leader called for aid from the Senones and Germanic tribes east of the Rhine. The Fourth legion withstood the siege and Indutiomarus was killed after an unsuccessful attack. His relatives made their escape across the Rhine. Before targeting the Eburones themselves, Caesar first attacked Ambiorix's allies, forcing them to promise that they would not help the tribe who had destroyed Cotta and Sabinus. The Nervii were the first victims of the Roman retaliation. During that winter a force of four legions laid waste the fields, took a great many cattle and prisoners. The Menapii were then attacked by five legions to deprive Ambiorix of potential help. Five legions were sent because, according to Caesar, they, alone of all the tribes of Gaul, had never sent ambassadors to him to discuss terms of peace, and had ties of hospitality with Ambiorix. A renewed campaign of devastation finally forced them to submit, and Caesar placed his ally Commius of the Atrebates in control of them.Julius Caesar, Commentaries on the Gallic War 6.2-6 After this Caesar built a bridge across the Rhine and campaigned in Germania to punish the German tribes who had aided the Treveri. When the Roman Senate heard what happened, Caesar swore to put down all the Belgic tribes. The Roman campaigns against the Belgae took a few years, but eventually the Belgae were no match against 50,000 trained Roman soldiers. The tribes were slaughtered or driven out and their fields burned. The Eburones ceased to exist following the campaign. The fate of the leaders of the revolt is different but neither was taken to walk in Caesar's triumphal parade. Cativolcus was now old, weak and unable to endure the hardships of flight. He solemnly cursed Ambiorix for instigating the conspiracy, and then committed suicide by poisoning himself with yew. Ambiorix and his men, however, managed to cross the Rhine and disappeared without a trace.

The white dwarf primary has 63% of the Sun's mass but a radius of only about 1% of the Sun. As of 2009, it has the shortest known spin period of any white dwarf, completing a full revolution every 33.08 seconds. This spin is decreasing at a rate of 1.78 ns per year, which is unusually high. The secondary star has a stellar classification of K4-5 V, making it a main sequence star that is generating energy at its core through the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen. It has about 37% of the Sun's mass but 79% of the Sun's radius. This system displays flare activity that has been observed across multiple bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, including X-rays. Mass is being lost from the secondary star, most of which is being flung out of the system by the rapidly spinning magnetic primary.

Among the passengers of the inaugural trip was Sebasti√°n Lerdo de Tejada, President of Mexico at the time. The rail trip took three days due to a number of official presidential events along the route. The original structure was demolished by Ferrocarriles Nacionales de M√©xico in 1958 to construct a new station nearby. The plot on which the original station stood was redeveloped. Buenavista Station was re-inaugurated in 1961 by President Adolfo L√≥pez Mateos. The headquarters of Ferrocarriles Nacionales de M√©xico were built in front of the station and to the north of the station, an automated postal facility was constructed. To the south of the station, the borough hall of the Borough of Cuauht√©moc was inaugurated in September 1976.

Cooper and starring William Powell, Richard Arlen, Clive Brook and Fay Wray. The film is the third of numerous film versions of the 1902 novel The Four Feathers written by A. E. W. Mason. Plot As children, Harry promises to marry Ethne, but she consents only if he will dress as a soldier. When Harry is still a child, his father tells him stories about the Crimean War, including one where a runaway soldier is spurred into suicide by Harry's father, who sent him a white feather to show his disapproval of cowardice. As a young man, Harry joins the army and is engaged to Ethne. His best friends are Durrance, Trench, and Castleton. Harry receives a telegram that their regiment is being deployed in Sudan, and he resigns from the army. His friends and Ethne find out why Harry resigned and give him four white feathers. Harry's father also disapproves, and gives him a pistol and tells him to shoot himself. Harry decides to act courageously in front of his friends in order to get them to take back their feathers, and travels to Sudan. In Sudan, Trench has been captured by the enemy. Harry saves him, and Trench takes back the white feather. Harry stops a mutiny and saves Castelton from an ambush. Ethne and Harry get back together.

It was also released by Paramount Pictures in a version with a Movietone soundtrack with music and sound effects only.IMDB entry The studio considered making it a full talkie, and acquired the dialogue rights to the story for an additional $2,500 on top of the silent rights for which they had paid $12,500.Brant p.61 The book the film was based on, The Four Feathers (1902), was one of the only books in Cooper's possession while he served as a volunteer for the Polish resistance in Ko≈õciuszko's Squadron. Cooper found the book inspirational. Kamran Rastegar, associate professor of Arabic and comparative literature at Tufts University, noted several parallels between Cooper's life and that of the protagonist of Four Feathers: both were born into military families, expelled from naval colleges, voluntarily enlisted, and escaped from military prisons. Cooper embraced the ideology both of the masculine ideal and the colonial idea that white men had a right to rule over others. Cooper, Shoedsack, and Shoedsack's wife, Ruth Rose, traveled to Tanzania and Sudan to shoot parts of the film in 1927. Cooper wrote \\"Two Fighting Tribes of Sudan\\" for a 1929 National Geographic article using material from the expedition. Film from the expedition was interweaved with parts shot on sets in Hollywood. Actors were not transported to Sudan, which helped reduce filming costs. Four Feathers was one of the first films to use this technique. Cooper oversaw trapping hippopotamuses for a scene where they stampede into a river, and three people died in the process. After a few native villagers went home during the trapping of hippos, Cooper beat \\"every native he could find.\\" Cooper observed the baboons for three months before capturing them, and his notes filled 800 pages. Cooper also put baboons on a suspension bridge over a river and cut it down in order to film them trying to swim to safety. Back in California, the producers built a large camp between Palm Springs and Indio to shoot the actors themselves in fight scenes. Cooper and Shoedsack hired African-Americans from Los Angeles to stand in for Hadendoan Sudanese men. Adolph Zukor, Paramont studio head, insisted on the film being silent, though directors wanted it to be a talkie. The film was billed as the \\"last of the big silent films\\" even though it had a soundtrack and sound effects. According to Thomas Schatz, producer Selznick saved the film from disaster by conducting retakes and reediting the film after its initial preview. Cooper requested that Selznick stay off of the set, and Selznick complied. However, Cooper was supposed to approve of Selznik's edits, but was away during postproduction of The Four Feathers. He disliked the new takes. Criticism Peter Limbrick, assistant professor in film and digital media at the University of California, Santa Cruz, noted that Four Feathers is a masculine adventure that values power above other virtues and excludes women. Limbrick also noted that the way the film used African-American extras in California to stand in for Hadendoans in Sudan reflected the way white settlers like Cooper viewed their position in society in the United States as mirroring that of the British colonialists invading Sudan. Cooper's comments to others while abroad showed that he viewed all black people as racially inferior, a settler superiority that leads to the narrative found in The Four Feathers, which is \\"responding less to the facts of the land than to preexisting colonial visions of it, and disavowing indigenous habitation and meaning.\\" Jeffrey Richards referenced how the characters of the young soldiers fulfilled the \\"Imperial hero\\" archetype: tall, thin, and mustached. Kamran Rastegar notes that Cooper's Feversham shows resentment and anger when reincorporated into the military and reunited with Ethne. Rather than transforming from a coward to a hero, Feversham seems to be a hero who \\"has only now found recognition for what he always had been.\\" According to Rastegar, Cooper's Feversham improved on colonial forms of masculinity by having him display \\"a brooding sense of ressentiment.\\" Fear of \\"a corruption of masculinity\\" is a constant theme in this and other versions of The Four Feathers; the fantasy of redemption through service to an empire leads to \\"a revalorization of\\" colonialism.

New York, 500 U.S. 352 (1991), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court, which held that a prosecutor may dismiss jurors who are bilingual in Spanish and English from juries that will consider Spanish- language testimony. Peremptory challenges are used to remove jurors thought to be undesirable for virtually any reason by either side in a court case. However, in Batson v. Kentucky (1986), the Supreme Court ruled that peremptory challenges may not be used to remove jurors because of their race. In Hernandez, the Supreme Court had to decide whether the peremptory exclusion of two Hispanic jurors was tantamount to exclusion because of race--and therefore violated the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.The case is recognized as expanding a Batson challenge to a peremptory strike based on a juror's ethnicity.U.S. v. Fuentes-Montijo, 68 F.3d 352, 354-55 (9th Cir. 1995)  Procedural History of the Case  Dinosio Hernandez was convicted by a jury of attempted murder on January 30, 1987 in New York Supreme Court.People v. Hernandez, 140 A.D.2d 543 (N.Y. App. Div. 1988). He appealed his conviction, claiming that under the U.S. Supreme Court's recent decision under Batson v. Kentucky,Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986). the prosecutor unconstitutionally used peremptory strikes against jury panel members who had Hispanic last names. On appeal, the court found that because the prosecutor had only challenged the three potential jurors with Hispanic surnames.Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 358 (1991). However, the appellate court found the prosecutor has a nondiscriminatory reason for the challenge because the stricken jurors either had a relative prosecuted by the district attorney's office or spoke Spanish and may not accept the translated testimony as final. Hernandez proceeded with his Batson claim and appealed to the New York Court of Appeals.People v. Hernandez, 75 N.Y.2d 350 (N.Y. 1990) New York's highest court of appeals agreed with the appellate court that Hernandez made a prima facie case of discrimination.People v. Hernandez, 75 N.Y.2d 350, 353 (N.Y. 1990). The court did not find that striking a juror based on their language alone was reversible error as it was a \\"legitimate neutral ground\\" for the prosecutor to be concerned of the Spanish-speaking jurors fidelity to a translate court record.People v. Hernandez, 75 N.Y.2d 350, 356 (N.Y. 1990). The majority noted that the trial judge was present during the entirety of the questioning and was satisfied with the prosecutor's actions as the stricken jurors' body-language signaled doubt. Judge Kaye authored the dissent, criticizing the majority for the diminished protections of Batson for New York and for deciding the case on federal and not state law.People v. Hernandez, 75 N.Y.2d 350, 360 (N.Y. 1990) (Kaye, J., dissenting). Rather than allow Batson's contours be defined over decades of litigation, Kaye argued that deciding the matter on state law would allow clearer protections earlier for New York residents. On the merits, Kaye believed too much deference was provided to the trial court's decision and was concerned that while the prosecutor expressed an interest in removing Spanish- speakers because of the interpreter there was no indication that any non- Latino jurors were asked if they spoke Spanish as well.People v. Hernandez, 75 N.Y.2d 350, 363 (N.Y. 1990) (Kaye, J., dissenting). The Supreme Court granted a writ of certiorari to determine if a Latino juror struck from jury service because of their Spanish language in a court translated proceeding violated a defendant's Batson protections.People v. Hernandez, 75 N.Y.2d 350 (N.Y. 1990), cert. granted, Hernandez v. New York, 111 S. Ct. 242 (1990) (No. 89-7645).

New York, 500 U.S. 352 (1991) (No. 89-7645) 1990 WL 10013132. MALDEF's argument focused on the wide usage of Spanish by Hispanics and the sociolinguistic evidence that supported Hispanics as living in a world where they are constantly required to switch between Spanish and English without the ability to turn off the ability to speak either.Brief for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund et. al. as Amici Curiae in Support of Petitioner at *6-10, Hernandez v.

New York, 500 U.S. 352 (1991) (No. 89-7645) 1990 WL 10013132. = Oral Argument = At oral argument, Hernandez argued that it is a per se Batson violation to discriminate on language.Transcript of Oral Argument at 4, Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352 (1991) (No. 89-7645). Hernandez believed that every bilingual juror would express the same hesitance that the striked jurors in his case would because of their language ability. The Court was concerned with line drawing issues of potential multiple dialects or languages for a given foreign country and if a prosecutor could ever use a peremptory strike against a bilingual juror. New York argued that Hernandez's position was against Supreme Court jurisprudence for three main reasons: it uses the juror's answer as proof of a prosecutor's intent to discriminate, it prevents individualized assessment of jurors in favor of group stereotypes, and it would create no ability for prosecutors to excuse certain jurors.Transcript of Oral Argument at *26-27, Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352 (1991) (No. 89-7645). = Plurality Decision = Justice Kennedy wrote the plurality opinion. After outlining the facts of the case and procedural history of the case, the Court moved on to the Court's jurisprudence on Batson. It reiterated Batson's three step process: first, a defendant must make a prima facie case of racial discrimination, second, if it is made the burden shifts to the prosecutor to make a race-neutral showing for the strike, and finally the trial judge make a determination if the defendant's claim stands.Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 358-59 (1991). Even though Hernandez did not make a prima facie showing before the prosecutor presented a race-neutral reasoning, the Court found this did not impact the analysis because it rested with the trial judge's determination. The Court side-stepped Hernandez's argument on the correlation between Spanish-speaking ability and ethnicity because of the additional factors the prosecutor articulated in his reasoning for striking the two Latino jurors.Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 360-61 (1991). Kennedy argued that even assuming all bilingual speakers would hesitate it did not fail a race-neutral analysis because it does not show an intent by the prosecutor to remove all bilingual Latinos and a negative impact does not violate race neutrality.Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 362-63 (1991). The trial court's decision is afforded a high level of deference under Batson, and the Court assumed that the trial judge took into account the case-specific factors in making the decision to accept the prosecutor's justification: the high concentration of Spanish speakers in the local population, Spanish as the predominant language for many in that region, the ethnic backgrounds of the parties and witnesses, and the prosecutor's swift justification. This level of deference was based on a trial judge's ability to decide credibility questions that cannot be reviewed solely through the record on the appeal.Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 363-66 (1991). The plurality did not find any reason that the trial judge's decision presented a clear error and was a permissible view under the evidence. In a closing dicta discussion, the plurality cited linguistic studies noting the complexity of language and bilingual distinctions. It further counseled that excluding bilinguals is unwise and may be unconstitutional under a different set of facts. Specifically, Kennedy outlined that creating a blanket policy regardless of the case's specific facts or for particular ethnic groups in certain communities language could be treated similarly to skin color under Batson. However, this was not that case.Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 370-72 (1991). = Concurrence = Justices O'Connor and Scalia concurred in the plurality's judgement. O'Connor agreed with the plurality's deference to the trial court's decision, but believed it went to far in deciding the constitutional question.Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 372 (1991) (O'Connor, J., concurring). After outlining the Court's jurisprudence under Batson and Washington v. Davis, O'Connor limited the Equal Protection Clause analysis for racial discrimination to race only. \\"No matter how closely tied or significantly correlated to race . . . [it] does not implicate the Equal Protection Clause unless it is based on race.\\"Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 375 (1991) (O'Connor, J., concurring). O'Connor reasoned that if a trial judge accepted a prosecutor's nonracial explanation, then there was nothing more for an appeals court to decide on a Batson claim. = Dissent = Justice Stevens dissented and Justice Marshall joined. Under Batson, Stevens argued that a prosecutor who attempts to rebut a prima facie showing of discrimination must do so with \\"'legitimate reasons' that are 'related to the particular case to be tried.'\\"Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 376 (1991) (Stevens, J., dissenting). Stevens found the Court erred by allowing an illegitimate explanation for the prosecutor's actions that went to the heart of Batson's protections of the Fourteenth Amendment.Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 377 (1991) (Stevens, J., dissenting). Further, Stevens found that the prosecutor's justification would disproportionately affect Spanish- speaking jurors, alternatives were available to address the prosecutor's concerns, and his reasoning should be viewed skeptically because he did not use a for cause challenge.Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 379 (1991) (Stevens, J., dissenting). Justice Blackmun dissented in a separate statement agreeing with Justice Stevens' dissent on the prosecutor's insufficient explanation for dispelling an inference of racial animus.Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 375 (1991) (Blackmun, J., dissenting).  Criticism of the Decision  The decision received immediate attention with a New York Times article that broke down the arguments and the court's reasoning. Law professors were also skeptical of the decision and its implications. Professor Juan Perea argued that the interconnection between race and language is not properly addressed and that the Supreme Court should have found the prosecutor's peremptory strikes not race-neutral.Juan F. Perea, Hernandez v. New York: Courts, Prosecutors, and the Fear of Spanish, 21 Hofstra L. Rev. 1, 3-5 (1992). Professor Deborah Ramirez highlighted that this decision could permit bilinguals to systematically be removed from juries and the pervasiveimpact that may have on Latinos.Deborah A. Ramierz, Excluded Voices: The Disenfranchisement of Ethnic Groups from Jury Service, 1993 Wis. L. Rev. 761, 762-63 (1993). Professor Alfredo Mirand√© furthered this research on \\"bilingualism as an immutable characteristic\\" under Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Doctrine and noted lower courts had expanded the Supreme Court's reasoning to allow peremptory challenges when a juror understands a foreign language when the translation is disputed at trial.Alfredo Mirande, \\"Now that I Speak English, no me Dejan Hablar [I'm not Allowed to Speak']\\": The Implications of Hernandez v. New York, 18 Chicano-Latino L. Rev. 115, 147 n.187 (1996) (citing Pemberthy v. Beyer, 19 F.3d 857, 858 (3rd Cir. 1994)). The Supreme Court has not revisited the question of potential discrimination towards bilingual or multilingual jurors since which has created confusion for lower courts. An examination of twenty years after Hernandez v. New York in California courts found the case's reasoning to be \\"an arbitrary and flawed tool\\" but California courts were hesitant to rule contrary.Farida Ali, Multilingual Prosepective Jurors: Assessing California Standards Twenty Years After Hernandez v. New York, 8 Nw. J.L. & Soc. Pol'y 236 (2013). This has left open the question of how the Court would rule if non-Latinos who spoke Spanish were allowed to remain in a jury while Spanish speaking Latinos were struck because of their language ability. Professor Mirand√© notes that Latinos across the board are hurt, monolingual Spanish speakers are barred because they lack English while bilingual jurors are struck because they know too much Spanish. He continues that instead bilingual Spanish speakers should be wanted by the court to play an important check on court translations. Another commentator has argued the courts should embrace more bilingualism because of the benefits it provides to the legal system as the Hernandez dissent discussed.Jayesh M. Rathod, The Transformative Potential of Attorney Bilingualism, 46 Univ. Mich. J. Law Reform 863, 895-898 (2013).  Aftermath of the Decision  Five years later, the Supreme Court cited to Hernandez v. New York as outlining the Batson steps and what met the \\"legitimate reason\\" standard for a prosecutor to strike a juror.Purkett v. Elem, 514 U.S. 765, 767-70 (1995). With the Supreme Court limiting the protections of Batson, states may be able to protect them on a state constitutional basis.Andrew McGuire, Peremptory Exclusion of Spanish-Speaking Jurors: Could Hernandez v. New York Happen Here, 23 N.M. L. Rev. 467, 472-73 (1993). Today, the case is understood to expand the Equal Protection Clause's protections of an unbiased jury to apply to ethnic origin alongside Batson's protections for race.U.S. v. Martinez-Salazar, 528 U.S. 304, 315 (2000). In a habeas corpus case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit acknowledged the close connection between language and race noting Kennedy remarked how language can lead to discrimination.Pemberthy v. Beyer, 19 F.3d 857, 869-70 (3d Cir. 1994). However, it found language did not meet the same \\"heightened\\" or \\"strict\\" scrutiny that race and gender under equal protection doctrine. The Third Circuit did outline that Latino jurors could not be struck because of the theoretical use of Spanish and placed a greater burden on trial judges to be \\"sensitive to the potential use of language-based peremptories for discriminatory purposes.\\"Pemberthy v. Beyer, 19 F.3d 857, 872-73 (3d Cir. 1994).

Flemish Kermess by David Teniers the Younger (1652) Below are some of common festivities associated with, or observed by the Dutch ethnic group. Included are cultural feasts. National holidays, of for example the Netherlands (such as Queen's Day) are omitted. Major festivities include: *Feast of Saint Nicholas. The feast celebrates the name day of Saint Nicholas, patron saint of, among other things, children, who are the principal focus of the feast. They receive presents, candy and poems. The origins of Saint Nicholas appear to be Christian, but in fact originate from ancient Germanic mythology, with Dutch figure of Sinterklaas representing the god Odin. Both have a beard, hat and spear (nowadays a staff) and the cloth bag held by the servants to capture naughty children. Both Saint Nicolas and Odin ride white horses that can fly through the air. The letters made of chocolate given by the Zwarte Pieten to the children evokes the fact that Odin ‚Äòinvented‚Äô the rune letters. The poems made during the celebration and the songs the children sing relate to Odin as the god of the arts of poetry. It's celebrated on December 5 or 6. *Christmas. Among the Dutch, Christmas (which lasts two days) is a time of togetherness. Gifts are generally not exchanged. Usually it is celebrated with ones direct, and not extended, family. It's celebrated on December 25 and 26. *New Year's Eve. The Dutch generally celebrate New Year's Eve, which is called Old Years' Night in Dutch, with friends and family. On this day, traditional New Years pastries like Oliebollen are eaten. At mid-night the Dutch wish all the best to all in their presence and fire works are set off. Following these activities it is customary to express a good intention for the next year. The following morning is marked by visits to family, usually parents. It's celebrated on December 31. *Kermesse. Originally denoting the mass said on the anniversary of the foundation of a church (or the parish) and in honour of the patron. Today Kermesse denotes the celebrations of such an anniversary. Many towns and larger villages hold their own Kermesse once every year. It can best be described as a mix of feasting, dancing, sports and funfair attractions. *Birthday. Birthdays, called Year days in Dutch, are greeted with enthusiasm in Dutch culture. Family and friends will probably visit, call or send a card. It is considered to be anti-social for a person to ignore his or her own birthday. Among the Dutch, instead of people showering the birthday person with special treats, it is the birthday person's place to treat those around him or her. This is exemplified by the custom to bring pastries for colleagues to work; and at school children bring treats for all their classmates. Dutch people generally keep a special Birthday calendar, often to be found in the bathroom of their houses.

History The band formed in 1995 under the name Psychodrama by three sisters, guitarist Gel, bassist Lisa, and singer Laura Baca. The three auditioned both male and female drummers, but couldn‚Äôt find one suitable for their planned style of music. Laura began experimenting with the drum set they had been using for auditions, and soon picked up the drumbeat despite never having played the instrument. About halfway through the rendition of the song, she started to sing along. The sisters stopped auditioning and Laura became both lead vocalist and drummer. The band played their first show under the name Psychodrama and released a single, \\"Vivid\\". In 1996 the sisters changed their band name to The Eyeliners while touring the west coast, as more appropriate for their musical style. Under their new name, the group has released EPs on Sympathy for the Record Industry followed by albums on Lookout Records in 2000 and 2001.\\"CD REVIEWS: By Divine Right, Garbage, Machine Head and many more\\".

The programme's cast originally consisted of William Andrews, David Armand, James Bachman, Marcus Brigstocke, Anna Crilly, Justin Edwards, Mark Evans, Mel Giedroyc, Marek Larwood and Nick Mohammed, most of whom have also written parts of the show. The first series began in 2008, where sketches included Jasmine and Prudith, who think everything will cost \\"a thousand pounds\\", and the Fearsome Vikings, who are scared of everything. The second series began in 2009 and featured three new cast members; Kobna Holdbrook-Smith, Fergus Craig and Toby Davies. Marek Larwood did not return. New sketches include Embarrassed Louise, who struggles to deal with an unusual problem; the Witchfinder General, who calls people witches and peasants show up to take them away; an angry Snowman, who battles for equality in everyday life; and Ross from the Outer Hebrides, who has the dubious distinction of being the only pupil in a school with just one teacher and a sitcom featuring a family of dung beetles. The third and final series started in May 2011. Javone Prince and a returning Marek Larwood appeared in the new series. Repeats were shown on CBBC until 2014. The show started airing on YTV Canada in late 2009, and series 2 started airing in late 2010.http://www.ytv.com/videos/default.aspx?v=AJ2OIMMacAujR0ZrDWCgqj8eEsF7KJSS/ Pixelface, another programme by CBBC, is inspired by the Backstage Access sketches.

A notable campaign was initiated in 2002 and endorsed by South Africa's Desmond Tutu.Of Occupation and Apartheid Do I Divest? , Desmond Tutu, CounterPunch, 17 October 2002 Tutu said that the campaign against Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories and its continued settlement expansion should be modeled on the successful historical, but controversial, disinvestment campaign against South Africa's apartheid system. Initial call to action Divestment campaigns targeting Israel first received media attention in 2002, thanks largely to a high-profile divestment petition at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology early that year.Faculty Urge Divestment from Israel, David H. Gellis, Harvard Crimson, 6 May 2002 This was followed later that same year by calls from South African anti-apartheid activist Desmond Tutu for the international community to treat Israel as it treated apartheid South Africa: > If apartheid ended, so can this occupation, but the moral force and > international pressure will have to be just as determined. The current > divestment effort is the first, though certainly not the only, necessary > move in that direction. The origin of the Israeli divestment campaigns can be traced back to the early 1990s just after similar programs targeting South Africa proved successful in (1) rallying political activists and (2) contributing to pressures that ‚Äì along with other economic and political factors - led to an end to white minority rule in that country.The End of Apartheid, United States Department of State Bureau of Public Affairs Targets for disinvestment Caterpillar Disinvestment campaigns have been focused on high-profile organizations with large financial holdings such as endowed universities or churches and municipalities managing large portfolios of retirement fund investments. Such high-profile institutions, like Harvard University or the multimillion-member Presbyterian and Methodist Churches, provided divestment proponents a platform from which to spotlight their political activity. In addition, the wide financial holdings of these institutions generally provided divestment campaigns a list of stocks upon which to base their calls for divestment. Disinvestment efforts Much of the disinvestment activity that has been widely publicized has come from the English-speaking world, but many Muslim groups have also called for divestment. Efforts have ranged from general boycotts to targeting specific Israeli companies. =United States=Churches=Presbyterian Church (USA)= In July 2004, the 2.4-million-member Presbyterian Church (USA), voted 431 to 62 in July to \\"initiate a process of phased selective divestment in multinational corporations operating in Israel.\\". The Church manages a set of investment funds totaling approximately $7 billion USD. According to the Church's highest elected official, Rev. Clifton Kirkpatrick, there is no plan for a \\"blanket divestment\\" from Israeli companies, but instead the Church will \\"target businesses that it believes bear particular responsibility for the suffering of Palestinians and will give them a chance to change their behavior before selling their shares.\\" Church officials, according to the Washington Post, mentioned Caterpillar Inc. as a possible target of the selective divestment campaign because the company \\"manufactures bulldozers used by Israel to demolish Palestinian homes that are built without permits or belong to families of suicide bombers.\\" There was significant opposition in the American Jewish community to the Church's decision. The Washington Post reported in September 2004 that \\"Jewish-Presbyterian relations have been in turmoil\\" and that \\"the heads of several major U.S. Jewish organizations condemned the Presbyterian Church's decision to begin selective divestiture in companies operating in Israel.\\" The executive vice president of the Central Conference of American Rabbis, Rabbi Paul Menitoff, said the resolution was \\"lopsided\\" and that it unfairly blamed only one side in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. In response to the criticism, Church official Kirkpatrick said that the Church would also \\"pull its money out of any companies that are complicit in supporting terrorism.\\" On 29 June 2006, the Presbyterian Church (USA) General Assembly by a vote of 483-28 adopted a balanced resolution that replaced language adopted in 2004 mandating a process of divestment focused on Israel and endorsed instead a corporate engagement process. Instead of using the word \\"divestment\\", the resolution calls for the Church to invest only in companies who are involved in \\"peaceful pursuits\\" in Israel and Palestinian territories.Church adopts compromise resolution on Israel by Nathan Guttman (The Jerusalem Post) 19 June 2006 In July 2012, the Presbyterian Church (USA) General Assembly decided to reject divestment and instead focus on investment. By a narrow vote of 333‚Äì331, the members voted to discard a resolution proposing divestment from Israel. This was followed by a vote of 369‚Äì290, with eight abstentions, for the church to pursue positive investment in the territories. In June 2014, the General Assembly, meeting in Detroit, voted 310‚Äì303 to divest from Caterpillar, Hewlett-Packard and Motorola Solutions. Supporters of the resolution said those companies were involved with \\"demolition and surveillance activities against Palestinians in the West Bank\\". =World Council of Churches= In February 2005, the Geneva-based World Council of Churches followed suit. The resolution passed by WCC's 150-member Central Committee commended the selective divestment resolution passed by the Presbyterian Church (USA) saying that the previous resolution \\"in both method and manner, uses criteria rooted in faith and calls members to do the things that make for peace.\\" The WCC planned to focus \\"on companies that assist the Israeli government in demolishing Palestinian homes, constructing settlements, and erecting a controversial 'dividing wall' within the Palestinian territories.\\" \\"The unexpected resolution\\", according to a BeliefNet report, \\"caught many American Jewish groups off guard and confirmed fears among some that the Presbyterians opened a Pandora's box last summer that now has the tacit approval of global Protestant and Orthodox leaders. Rabbi Gary Bretton-Granatoor, interfaith director for the Anti-Defamation League, dismissed the WCC as 'irrelevant' but was nonetheless concerned that the divestment campaign has taken on a life of its own.\\" =United Church of Christ= The United Church of Christ also followed suit, endorsing a range of economic leverages that included divestment, but church leaders did not commit their pension or foundation assets to a divestment plan.. =United Methodist Church= In June 2005, the New England Conference of the United Methodist Church had voted to urge the divesting of funds from companies that support the Israeli occupation of Palestinian Territories. The resolution stated: * \\"Whereas the United Methodist Church should not profit from the illegal Israeli occupation of Palestinian land or the destruction of Palestinian homes, orchards, and lives,\\" * \\"Whereas we are committed to ensuring that our denomination‚Äôs money is used in a manner consistent with our beliefs, with international law, and with Christ‚Äôs teaching.\\" At the 2012 Tampa Conference, the United Methodist Church twice rejected resolutions on May 2, that called for divestment from companies that were accused of contributing to the \\"Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories\\", including \\"Caterpillar, Motorola Solutions and Hewlett-Packard.\\"Methodist church says no to Israel divestment initiative Approximately 2/3 of the 1,000 delegates in attendance rejected the divestment resolutions. The church also rejected similar resolutions in 2008. According to Reverend Bob Long, \\"Of course we care about the Palestinians, and what they've been through. But we also care about the Israelis and what they've been through.\\" In June 2014, the Methodist pension board voted to divest. =Episcopal Church= In July 2012, the Episcopal Church adopted a resolution at its General Convention Assembly that supported \\"a negotiated two-state solution\\" and \\"positive investment\\" rather than divestment from Israel. =Others= Other mainline churches have debated the subject of divestment. The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America rejected a pro-divestment resolution during the summer of 2005. The Episcopal Church USA ruled out the possibility of an Israel divestment later that year, and the United Methodist Church has also avoided divestment.

Court) * Stanford University (SU) 10-4-1 At universities the focus has largely been to pass resolutions supporting divestment in student government. Few campaigns have gone further than these resolutions in pressuring universities to agree to divest. Some student organizations support the broader Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign on campus, often in cooperation with other progressive campus groups. On 17 March 2010, a UC Berkeley Student Senate resolution asked that the university divest itself of companies that conduct business with Israel, especially targeting General Electric and United Technologies which supplies arms and technology to Israel, but it was vetoed on 24 March by the Student Body President who called it \\"a symbolic attack on a specific community\\".Tufts Daily UC Berkeley and the Israel divestment bill By Ariella Charny Published: Monday, May 3, 2010 In 2013, another UC Berkeley Student Senate resolution was passed as SB160, which proposed the university divest itself of companies complicit in Israel's abuse of human rights in Gaza. On February 8, 2015, the University of California Student Association passed a resolution calling on the UC Board of Regents to divest from companies violating Palestinian human rights in the West Bank and Gaza. The historic vote passed in an overwhelming majority of 9‚Äì1 with 6 abstentions. In May 2015, the Princeton graduate student community voted by a margin of 56%-39% (4.5% abstaining) in favor of a non-binding resolution to \\"divest from multinational corporations that maintain the infrastructure of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, facilitate Israel's and Egypt's collective punishment of Palestinian civilians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, or facilitate state repression against Palestinians by Israeli, Egyptian, and Palestinian Authority security forces, until these corporations cease such activities.\\" =United Kingdom= In 2006, the Church of England synod voted to end investments in companies supporting Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories. This was criticised by George Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury as \\"inappropriate, offensive and highly damaging\\". =Ireland= At its biennial delegate conference held in May 2008, IMPACT (the Irish Municipal, Public and Civil Trade Union), Ireland's largest public sector and services trade union, passed two resolutions criticising Israeli suppression of the Palestinians and endorsing a boycott of Israeli goods and services. The motions also supported divestment from those corporations engaged in or profiting from the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. =Canada=2006 The Toronto assembly of the United Church of Canada supports CUPE's boycott. In 2003, the Toronto assembly voted to boycott goods produced by Jewish settlements in the occupied territories.\\"United Churches in Toronto to endorse boycott of Israel\\", National Post, 28 June 2006 The national umbrella UCC absolved itself of a boycott by instead choosing to support pro-peace investment. On 27 May 2006, the Ontario section of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (which represents more than 200,000 workers) approved a resolution to \\"support the international campaign of boycott, divestment and sanctions against Israel until that state recognizes the Palestinian right to self-determination\\" and to protest the Israeli West Bank barrier.CUPE Ontario delegates support campaign against Israeli \\"apartheid wall\\".

The Congress of South African Trade Unions published a letter expressing their support for the CUPE boycott of Israel.South African union joins boycott of Israel by Ronen Bodoni (YnetNews) 8 June 2006 2009 In January 2009, CUPE's Ontario University Workers Coordinating Committee announced plans to introduce Resolution 50 that would ban Israeli academics from speaking, teaching or researching at Ontario universities. Sid Ryan, president of CUPE Ontario, stated that \\"Israeli academics should not be on our campuses unless they explicitly condemn the university bombing and the assault on Gaza in general.\\" Ryan stated that the resolution was a reasonable response to Israel's attack on the Islamic University, which he likened to the torching of books by Nazis during the Second World War.Ontario union calls for ban on Israeli professors by Vanessa Kortekaas, National Post, 5 January 2009CUPE Ontario to recommend support for ban on Israeli academics in response to Gaza bombings , Press Release from CUPE Ontarion, 5 January 2009. Janice Folk-Dawson, chairwoman of the university workers committee, stated that resolution will protect the quality of education by preventing Israeli academics from professing biased views. She also stated that \\"International pressure on Israel must increase to stop the massacre that is going on daily. We are proud to add CUPE voices to others from around the world saying enough is enough\\" and that support for the resolution \\"is coming from the rank-and- file members, not just the leadership.\\" Despite the expected backlash, Folk- Dawson stated that \\"We believe we are doing the right thing.\\" The resolution was immediately criticized by the Leo Rudner of the Canadian Jewish Congress, who stated \\"I think it's ironic individuals who speak about freedom of speech jump to the opportunity to take that freedom away from other individuals.\\" Emanuel Adler, chairman of Israeli Studies at the University of Toronto, also criticized the resolution, stating that \\"the conflict and the violence should not be brought inside the university.\\" Jonathan Kay, a columnist for the National Post, sharply criticized the resolution, stating that \\"Mr. Ryan and his fellow CUPE leaders care about demonizing only one country: the Jewish state.\\"Jonathan Kay on the disgusting anti-Israeli bigtory of Sid Ryan and CUPE Ontario by Jonathan Kay, National Post, 5 January 2009. Michael Neumann, a philosophy professor at Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario expressed support for the boycott. Neumann stated that \\"If people believe these are extreme circumstances and it will do some good, then I think it's reasonable and perhaps justified.\\" He argued that a boycott is not anti-semitic, stating that \\"It targets Israeli, not Jewish, professors.\\" He further stated that \\"People may always have bad motives underlying good motives. And it's not absolutely impossible that some of these people have anti-Semitic feelings deep down, but do I think that plays a large part? No, I certainly do not.\\"Ontario union's proposed Israeli ban not anti-Semitic: academics by Katie Daubs and Lee Greenberg, Canwest News Service (reprinted by the National Post), 6 January 2009. Costanza Musu, an associate professor at the University of Ottawa, called the boycott \\"wrong and maladroit in every possible way\\" and stated that \\"It is a very sad moment when someone in academia starts considering the boycott of colleagues as a valid an honourable instrument of political struggle.\\"University of Ottawa professor Costanza Musu: Why boycotting Israeli professors is wrong by Costanza Musu, printed in the National Post, 6 January 2009. The resolution will be put to vote at the committee's annual conference in February. If it passes, it will be on the agenda at CUPE Ontario's conference in May. However, some observers have questioned what practical effect the resolution could have since CUPE's 200,000 workers province-wide include some campus staff but almost no full- time faculty. On 14 January 2009, the University of Ottawa Centre for International Policy Studies, directed by Professor Roland Paris, published the following 'Statement on Freedom of Speech': > Freedom of speech is a core value of Canadian society, especially within its > universities where the expression and debate of different positions is > crucial to learning.

The three stated goals of the campaign are: # An end to Israel's \\"occupation and colonization of all Arab lands and dismantling the Wall;\\" # Israeli recognition of the \\"fundamental rights of the Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel to full equality;\\" and, # Israeli respect, protection, and promotion of \\"the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and properties as stipulated in UN resolution 194.\\" Attempts to create a similar movement focusing on divestment from Israel, such as the Palestine Solidarity Committee's \\"Don‚Äôt Pay for Occupation\\" campaign,The Ninth United Nations North American NGO Symposium on the Question of Palestine, failed to raise similar support, largely because (1) divestment was only one part of these program agendas which also focused on US foreign aid to Israel (as one activist put it \\"Although the campaign achieved many political aims, it failed to present a strategy of how one should not pay for occupation.\\");Divestment from Israel in its Fifth Year by Eyad Kishawi and (2) the notion that Israel was the natural successor to Apartheid South Africa as the next target for divestment was rejected not just by most American Jews and Jewish organizations, but also by human rights groups who had played a major role in the fight against Apartheid.Israel in a Weak Parallel with Apartheid Interview with Dennis Davis, High Court Judge in Cape Town Opinions=Supporters= Noam Chomsky argues that for maximum impact, disinvestment campaigns should target the corporations participating in the perceived human rights abuses, with Caterpillar Inc. given as an example due to their role in the demolition of Palestinian homes.Professor Noam Chomsky - Human Rights in 21st Century =Opponents= Critics of the proposals argue that making unilateral demands on Israel will not promote negotiation and a just peace.\\"Presbyterians' Shameful Boycott\\" , by Alan Dershowitz (Los Angeles Times) 4 August 2004 Furthermore, disinvestment, it is claimed, would hurt Palestinians more than any other, as all of the Israeli factories located beyond the Green Line employ Palestinian workers, providing 70,000 jobs for Palestinians.Calev Myers: Palestinians should protest The Times of Israel, 17 July 2013.

Brown, writing on February 4, 2015 in the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace website, suggests that the U.S. Presbyterian Church and its divestment plan have now become entangled with the U.S. Internal Revenue Revenue Code. He writes that Shurat HaDin \\"a deep-pocketed legal advocacy organization anxious to take action against those it deems hostile to Israeli interests, accused the church of violating the tax code by having contact with Hezbollah, which Washington has designated as a terrorist organization.\\"Nathan J.

Its flagship product is a large-scale, public access walkability index that assigns a numerical walkability score to any address in the United States, Canada, and Australia. The company is headquartered in Seattle, Washington. Company Walk Score was founded in July 2007, inspired in part by a Sightline Institute blog post that proposed the number of establishments within one mile as a simple test of walkability. The company's mission is \\"to promote walkable neighborhoods\\" with the belief that such neighborhoods are \\"one of the simplest and best solutions for the environment, our health, and our economy.\\" In January 2012, the company announced that it had recently raised $2 million from investors. On October 22, 2014 the company was bought by the residential real estate company Redfin.https://www.redfin.com/blog/2014/10/redfin-buys- walk-score.html Consumer products=Walk Score= The company's flagship product is the Walk Score, a walkability index and the namesake of the company. Walk Score is a type of automated efficiency model focused on location efficiency. The company serves more than four million scores per day to over ten thousand participating websites. A Walk Score may be assigned to a particular address or an entire region, and the company maintains a ranking of the most walkable cities in the United States. Josh Herst, CEO of Walk Score, has stated that he wants Walk Score to be a part of every real-estate listing in the future. He envisions the Walk Score of a home to be as important as how many bedrooms or bathrooms the property has. According to the site's creators, \\"The Walk Score algorithm awards points based on the distance to the closest amenity in each category. If the closest amenity in a category is within .25 miles (or .4 km), we assign the maximum number of points. The number of points declines as the distance approaches 1 mile (or 1.6 km)‚Äîno points are awarded for amenities farther than 1 mile. Each category is weighted equally and the points are summed and normalized to yield a score from 0‚Äì100. The number of nearby amenities is the leading predictor of whether people walk.\\" Relevant amenities include \\"businesses, parks, theaters, schools and other common destinations.\\" =Other features= Similar to the Walk Score, the company also assigns a Bike Score and Transit Score to points on the map. Walk Score can generate a commute report that shows the time required to travel between two points, providing a visual representation of the changes in elevation during the trip. Commuting options include walking, bicycling, driving, or taking public transport. In 2011, Walk Score unveiled an apartment search tool that locates available housing based on commute time to a given location. The tool calculates commute times for various modes of transport including walking, cycling, driving, and public transit. Walk Score has developed a variety of tools for real estate professionals, such as neighborhood maps and APIs. Multiple independent studies have demonstrated that above-average walkability correlates to increased housing values: in the metropolitan areas studied, higher Walk Score typically added US$4,000‚Äì$34,000 per home. The company also provides data to leading research institutions, academics, and city planners including: * Walk Score and Transit Score for all U.S. and some international addresses * Road metrics such as intersection density and block length * Heat maps for potentially walkable locations This data is available for download (including spreadsheet and GIS shapefile formats) or accessible through an API. =Criticism= Walk Score has received some criticism in the media, particularly from urban planning professionals, for the limits of its accuracy and relevancy in methodology and results. Specifically, Walk Score doesn't calculate whether there are sidewalks, how many lanes of traffic one must cross, how much crime occurs in the area, or what the weather is typically like. It also doesn't differentiate between types of amenities, for example a supermarket grocery store versus a small food mart selling mostly chips and liquor. Walk Score does not accurately score areas adjacent to international borders. The algorithm prioritizes locations across the border which leads to low and inaccurate scores. Professional products=Travel Time API= Walk Score's Travel Time API provides a programming interface to get travel times between an origin and a set of destinations. Travel Time API can sort multiple destinations based on walking time, taking a public transit, driving time, or biking. Suggested applications are ranking points of interest nearest to multiple destinations, such as hotels near multiple meetings or attractions; ranking multiple destinations nearest to a specific location, such as sorting of local deals; and for maps and visualizations. =Public Transit API= An API access to Transit Score and nearby public transit stops and routes. =Walk Score API= An API access to the Walk Score walkability index.

Since 1966, it has produced the annual Indianapolis Early Music Festival, the oldest continuous Early Music festival in the United States.Nuvo Newsweekly article 2009 Its annual summer festival spans three weekends and features American and international performers who perform on instruments of the period. Beyond the festival, IEM also presents other Early Music concerts throughout the year while also fostering educational programs in Indianapolis schools. History Indianapolis Early Music, originally known by its corporate name of the Festival Music Society, was founded in 1966 to provide music during the summer months when the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra, now one of the few full-year U.S. orchestras, was on vacation. The IEM initially concentrated on the major works of the baroque era, such as Bach, Handel and Vivaldi. The range of music presented was soon expanded to include that of the Renaissance and Medieval periods. Music played at IEM concerts is that of works generally composed between 900 AD and 1800 AD. Performances have included vocal music, both choral and solo; instrumental music, both ensemble and solo; and dance, court, folk and ballet. Among the more noteworthy early concerts was the 1977 performance of the cycle of seven Bach Partitas by harpsichordist Igor Kipnis in Indianapolis just before making his Grammy- nominated recordings of them for Angel Records.Source: Baker‚Äôs Biographical Dictionary of 20th Century Classical Musicians (1997) Outreach IEM has a long association with public radio.

The Cln3 protein is a budding yeast G1 cyclin that controls the timing of Start, the point of commitment to a mitotic cell cycle. It is an upstream regulator of the other G1 cyclins, and it is thought to be the key regulator linking cell growth to cell cycle progression. It is a 65 kD, unstable protein; like other cyclins, it functions by binding and activating cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK). Cln3 in Start regulation Cln3 regulates Start, the point at which budding yeast commit to the G1/S transition and thus a round of mitotic division. It was first identified as a gene controlling this process in the 1980s; research over the past few decades has provided a mechanistic understanding of its function. =Identification of CLN3 gene= The CLN3 gene was originally identified as the whi1-1 allele in a screen for small size mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (for Cln3's role in size control, see below). This screen was inspired by a similar study in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, in which the Wee1 gene was identified as an inhibitor of cell cycle progression that maintained normal cell size. Thus, the WHI1 gene was at first thought to perform a size control function analogous to that of Wee1 in pombe. However, it was later found that WHI1 was in fact a positive regulator of Start, as its deletion caused cells to delay in G1 and grow larger than wild- type cells. The original WHI1-1 allele (changed from whi1-1 because it is a dominant allele) in fact contained a nonsense mutation that removed a degradation-promoting PEST sequence from the Whi1 protein and thus accelerated G1 progression. WHI1 was furthermore found to be a cyclin homologue, and it was shown that simultaneous deletion of WHI1‚Äîrenamed CLN3‚Äîand the previously identified G1 cyclins, CLN1 and CLN2, caused permanent G1 arrest. This showed that the three G1 cyclins were responsible for controlling Start entry in budding yeast. =G1-S transition= The three G1 cyclins collaborate to drive yeast cells through the G1-S transition, i.e. to enter S-phase and begin DNA replication. The current model of the gene regulatory network controlling the G1-S transition is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: Regulation of the G1-S transition in budding yeast. The key targets of the G1 cyclins in this transition are the transcription factors SBF and MBF (not shown in the diagram), as well as the B-type cyclin inhibitor Sic1. Cln-CDKs activate SBF by phosphorylating and promoting nuclear export of its inhibitor, Whi5, which associates with promoter-bound SBF. The precise mechanism of MBF activation is unknown. Together, these transcription factors promote the expression of over 200 genes, which encode the proteins necessary for carrying out the biochemical activities of S-phase. These include the S-phase cyclins Clb5 and Clb6, which bind CDK to phosphorylate S-phase targets. However, Clb5,6-CDK complexes are inhibited by Sic1, so S-phase initiation requires phosphorylation and degradation of Sic1 by Cln1,2-CDK to proceed fully. =Cln3 activates a Cln1,2 positive feedback loop= Although all three G1 cyclins are necessary for normal regulation of Start and the G1-S transition, Cln3 activity seems to be the deciding factor in S-phase initiation, with Cln1 and Cln2 serving to actuate the Cln3-based decision to transit Start. It was found early on that Cln3 activity induced expression of Cln1 and Cln2. Furthermore, Cln3 was a stronger activator Start transit than Cln1 and Cln2, even though Cln3-CDK had an inherently weaker kinase activity than the other Clns. This indicated that Cln3 was an upstream regulator of Cln1 and Cln2. Furthermore, it was found, as shown in Figure 1, that Cln1 and Cln2 could activate their own transcription via SBF, completing a positive feedback loop that could contribute to rapid activation and S-phase entry. Thus, Start transit seems to rely on reaching a sufficient level of Cln3-CDK activity to induce the Cln1,2 positive feedback loop, which rapidly increases SBF/MBF and Cln1,2 activity, allowing a switch-like G1-S transition. The role of positive feedback in this process has been challenged, but recent experiments have confirmed its importance for rapid inactivation and nuclear export of Whi5, which is the molecular basis of commitment to S-phase. Cln3 and cell size control As discussed above, Cln3 was originally identified as a regulator of budding yeast cell size. The elucidation of the mechanisms by which it regulates Start has revealed a means for it to link cell size to cell cycle progression, but questions remain as to how it actually senses cell size. =Start requires a threshold cell size= The simple observation that cells of a given type are similar in size, and the question of how this similarity is maintained, has long fascinated cell biologists. The study of cell size control in budding yeast began in earnest in the mid 1970s, when the regulation of the budding yeast cell cycle was first being elucidated by Lee Hartwell and colleagues. Seminal work in 1977 found that yeast cells maintain a constant size by delaying their entry into the cell cycle (as assayed by budding) until they have grown to a threshold size. Later worked refined this result to show that Start specifically, rather than some other aspect of the G1-S transition, is controlled by the size threshold. =Translational size sensing= That Start transit requires the attainment of a threshold cell size directly implies that yeast cells measure their own size, so that they can use that information to regulate Start. A favored model for how yeast cells, as well as cells of other species, measure their size relies on the detection of overall translation rate. Essentially, since cell growth consists, to a great extent, of the synthesis of ribosomes to produce more proteins, the overall rate of protein production should reflect cell size. Thus, a single protein that is produced at a constant rate relative to total protein production capacity will be produced in higher quantities as the cell grows. If this protein promotes cell cycle progression (Start in the case of yeast), then it will link cell cycle progression to translation rate and, therefore, cell size. Importantly, this protein must be unstable, so that its levels depend on its current translation rate, rather than the rate of translation over time. Furthermore, since the cell grows in volume as well as mass, the concentration of this size sensor will remain constant with growth, so its activity must be compared against something that does not change with cell growth. Genomic DNA was suggested as such a standard early on, because it is (by definition) present in a constant quantity until the start of DNA replication. How this occurs remains a major question in current studies of size control (see below). Before the identification of Cln3 and its function, accrued evidence indicated that such translational size sensing operated in yeast. First, it was confirmed that the total rate of protein synthesis per cell increases with growth, a fundamental prerequisite for this model. It was later shown that treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide delayed Start in yeast, indicating that translation rate controlled Start. Finally, it was also shown that this delay occurred even with short pulses of cycloheximide, confirming that an unstable activating protein was required for Start. =Cln3 as size sensor= The model of budding yeast size control, in which a threshold size for Start entry is detected by a translational size sensor, required a \\"sizer\\" protein; the properties of Cln3 made it the prime candidate for that role from the time of its discovery. First, it was a critical Start activator, as G1 length varied inversely with Cln3 expression and activity levels. Second, it was expressed nearly constitutively throughout the cell cycle and in G1 in particular‚Äîunusual for cyclins, which (as their name suggests) oscillate in expression with the cell cycle. These two properties meant that Cln3 could serve as a Start activator that depended on total translation rate. Finally, Cln3 was also shown to be highly unstable, the third necessary property of a translational sizer (as discussed above). Thus, Cln3 seems to be the size sensor in budding yeast, as it exhibits the necessary properties of a translational sizer and is the most upstream regulator of Start. A critical question remains, however, as to how its activity is rendered size dependent. As noted above, any translational size sensor should be at constant concentration, and thus constant activity, in the cytoplasm as cells grow. In order to detect its size, the cell must compare the absolute number of sizer molecules to some non-growing standard, with the genome the obvious choice for such a standard. It was originally thought that yeast accomplished this with Cln3 by localizing it (and its target, Whi5) to the nucleus: nuclear volume was assumed to scale with genome content, so that an increasing concentration of Cln3 in the nucleus could indicate increasing Cln3 molecules relative to the genome. However, the nucleus has recently been shown to grow during G1, irrespective of genome content, undermining this model. Recent experiments have suggested that Cln3 activity could be titrated directly against genomic DNA, through its DNA-bound interaction with SBF-Whi5 complexes. Finally, other models exist that do not rely on comparison of Cln3 levels to DNA. One posits a non-linear relationship between total translation rate and Cln3 translation rate caused by an Upstream open reading frame; another suggests that the increase in Cln3 activity at the end of G1 relies on competition for the chaperone protein Ydj1, which otherwise holds Cln3 molecules in the Endoplasmic reticulum.

Twist-necked turtles have extremely flat shells that help them hide from predators under rocks and debris. When threatened, this turtle withdraws by twisting its head into its shell. P. platycephala is the only species of the genus Platemys and occurs in northern and central South America. Platemys platycephala means ‚Äúflat turtle, flat-head‚Äù and accurately describes the structure of the head and shell. This species inhabits shallow creek beds and frequently forages on the floor of the Amazon rainforest for insects, amphibians, and mollusks. Camouflage, head and body shape, and advanced sexual anatomy allow this species of turtle to effectively populate much of South America. Mating occurs during rainy months (March‚ÄìDecember) and egg deposit occurs during dry months (January‚ÄìMarch). Males have been known to behave aggressively towards females during copulation by squirting water from nostrils and biting. A few genomic studies show mosaicism exists among populations of the twist-necked turtle in Surinam. In other words, diploid and triploid levels exist among individuals at this particular location. No threats have been reported for this species and the International Union for Conservation of Nature does not have a current listing. Lack of human consumption due to the species' small size and its wide range explain why scientists are not concerned about this turtle species. Diagnosis The twist-necked turtle now represents the only species of Platemys and can be distinguished from close relatives (Acanthochelys) by its doubly flat body plan, both a flattened shell and a flattened head. Also, this turtle displays an unusual dual grooved pattern on the carapace. P. platycephala inhabits a wide range compared to other Acanthochelys turtles. Two subspecies, P. p. platycephala and P. p. melanonota is described based on the color pattern. Camouflage is highly useful for the twist-necked turtle because it inhabits shallow pools and creek beds. The orange and brown head pattern makes it difficult to spot from above because of similarly colored leaf litter along small pools and creek beds. Other distinctions include a hook at the base of the foot for copulation in males and a specialized opening at the base of the plastron for oviposition (egg deposit). Description P. platycephala is a medium-sized turtle ranging from 14‚Äì18 cm in shell length.Ernst, CH and Barbour, RW. Turtles of the World. Washington D.C., Smithsonian Institution, 1989. Print. Females are slightly smaller on average, with shorter tails. The carapace (top portion of the shell) is elliptical and flattened with two raised portions (keels) forming a trough (depression). The carapace is orange to yellow-brown and black in various amounts depending on subspecies. The plastron (lower portion of the shell) is dark brown or black in color while the bridge (side portion of the shell) is yellow with a black bar across. The consistency of these bars also depends on subspecies. Face and neck patterns consist of orange or yellow-brown dorsal stripes and black ventral and lateral stripes. The head is small, triangular, smooth, and undivided. The neck has some conical tubercles- rounded projections and scales that protect against predator attack. P. platycephala is a member of the Pleurodira- a suborder of turtles. These turtles withdraw their heads into their shells by bending their necks sideways instead of straight back like Cryptodira. The snout projects slightly and the irises are brown. Black limbs contain large anterior scales, while the tail is short and black. Intermediate webbing exists on both anterior and posterior limbs because this turtle moves in water and on land.Pritchard, P. C. H. Encyclopedia of Turtles. New Jersey, TFH Pub. 1979. Print. Genetics A few interesting genetics studies exist for the twist-necked turtle. Bickham et al. (1993) performed a small-scale cytological survey on the ploidy levels (number of sets of chromosomes) for somatic and gametic cells on a few specimens in Suriname.Bickham, JW, Hanks, BG, Hale DW, & Martin JE. 1993. Ploidy Diversity and the Reproduction of Balanced Gametes in Male Twist-Necked turtles (Platemys platycephala). Copeia, 3: 724-727. The authors examined multiple tissues (spleen, liver, blood, testis) of six specimens (five males, one female) and found cells contained various ploidy levels within and among individuals. One male individual even consisted of triploid-tetraploid cells. More genetic variation was found with respect to diploid (2n) to triploid (3n) ratio occurred among individuals than within individuals. Also, diploid cells exclusively participated in meiosis and subsequent sexual reproduction for males, so balanced gametes and normal fertility occurred. This is a rare event because of the limited viable polyploid individuals that occur in natural vertebrate populations. The lizard genus Lacerta and fish genus Phoxinus are the only other known examples of diploid-triploid mosaicism.Dawley, RM & Goddard, KA. 1988. Diploid-triploid Mosaics among Unisexual Hybrids of the Minnows Phoxinus-Eos and Phoxinus- Neogaeus. Copeia, 3: 650-660.Kupritanova, L. 2009. Cytogenetic and Genome Trends in the Evolution of Lizards. Cytogenetic and Genome Research, 2-4: 273-279. Additionally, P. platycephala contains several combinations of ploidy level (x n) in various cell or tissue types. This phenomenon is known as mosaicism or chimerism. In a follow-up study, Bickham & Hanks (2009) performed cytogenic analysis of the twist-necked turtle to determine how widespread this process is throughout South America, and discovered normal diploid populations exist in Bolivia, while variable mosaic populations persist in Suriname. Additionally, Darr et al. (2006) found turtle populations from French Guiana had increased triploid frequency compared to both Bolivia and Suriname.Darr, ER, Huebinger, RM, Williams, KS, & Bickham, JW. 2006. Ploidy Mosaicism and Molecular Differentiation among Populations of the South American Twist-necked Turtle Platemys platycephala. Ohio Journal of Science, 106: 46-47. Several hypotheses were tested using phylogenetic data from mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), but a high level of divergence was found for the three monophyletic populations. Distribution The twist-necked turtle inhabits a large area throughout northern and central South America, from the southern Orinoco drainage in Venezuela to the Amazon basin. However, P. platycephala does not inhabit large rivers, but instead is found in shallow creeks and on forest floors.‚ÄúTwist-necked Turtle.‚Äù Turtles of the World. NLBIF, n.d. Web, 31 March 2011. Ernst (1983) surveyed the extensive geographical range of the twist- necked turtle and determined the presence of a dark subspecies in its western range. The author uses the \\"Quaternary forest refuge theory\\" to explain the existence of this subspecies. The theory is based on significant climatic changes occurring in and around the equator during the Quaternary period. During these climatic changes of glaciation, the northern rainforests of South America received less rainfall and deteriorated, then subsequently expanded during interglaciation. This change caused allopatric speciation to occur among many species and gave rise to a new subspecies - P. p. melanonota.Ernst, CH. 1983. Geographic variation in the neotropical turtle, Platemys pltycephala. 17 (4): 345-355. =Subspecies= Two subspecies exist for the twist-necked turtle; P. p. platycephala inhabits most of the central and eastern territory (Brazil, Guianas, Venezuela, Colombia, Bolivia and most of its Peruvian range), while P. p. melanonata inhabits the western territory (Ecuador and adjacent northern Peru). The chief distinction between these subspecies is the carapace coloration. P. p. melanonata, (western twist-necked turtle or black-backed twist-necked turtle), has an entirely dark brown or black top shell. Ecology The coloration and shape of the carapace, head, and feet help conceal this species of turtle from Amazon predator species. Naturally, twist-necked individuals prefer amphibian eggs and consume various insects, mollusks (snails and slugs), amphibians, and some plant life through terrestrial and aquatic foraging. In captivity, specimens can flourish on reptile food, vegetables, insects, worms, and even fish. P. platycephala is likely to be found in shallow pools and can inhabit dry areas for long periods of time. Several individuals can even become heavily parasitized by leeches (81 suckers found on one turtle) during the dormant dry season and suffer accordingly.Fretey, J. 1975. Les Cheloniens do Guaye francaise. C.R. Seances Soc. herp. in Bull. Soc. Zool. 100 (4): 674-675. Life history The young or hatchlings typically resemble parents except for brighter coloration. Twist- necked hatchlings measure around 4‚Äì6 cm in carapace length and about 20 g or 0.04 lbs. Mating typically occurs during the rainy season of the Amazon rainforest (late March to early December). Males follow females, mount from behind, then proceed to rub their chin barbels (fleshy filament) against the top of females‚Äô heads. Some authors also report violent biting and water expulsion from the males' nostrils during copulation.Bonin, F, Devaux, B, and Dupre, A. Turtles of the World. Baltimore, Johns Hopkins UP, 2006. Print. Coupling has been observed on land and in water, and usually occurs late in the afternoon or at night. Oviposition occurs during the dry season (late December to early March) when the female deposits a large, oval egg (around 5 cm long and 2.5 cm wide). Many herpetologists report females depositing another egg a few weeks later while some recreational collectors report multiple eggs at a time. Shallow indentations are made to deposit eggs, and then they are lightly covered by sand and/or leaf litter. Conservation P. platycephala is rarely hunted for human consumption due to its small size. In captivity, this turtle is susceptible to fungal infections and is not considered a beginner's species.‚ÄúTwistneck.‚Äù Austins Turtle Page. ATP, n.d.

Early life and education Seiferheld was born in Villarrica, Guair√° into a Jewish family of German and Russian background. His parents fled Europe and settled years before in Paraguay. He received his high school diploma in 1967. At the beginning of the seventies, Seinferheld studied at the University of the Sorbonne in Paris. Subsequently, he pursued postgraduate studies at the School of Philosophy of the National University of Asunci√≥n where he received a gold medal. He was married to Bibi Yurita. Career In 1986 he received his doctorate degree for his thesis work titled Nazism and fascism in Paraguay. Seiferheld published Post and stamps Paraguayans in 1975 and Philately, fans without barriers in 1976. He was the founder and first president of the Philatelic Association of Paraguay. He authored a book The Jews in Paraguay in 1981, reflecting on the Jewish presence in Paraguay. He was an active journalist in the daily newspaper ABC Color in Paraguay, where he published numerous articles of historical content, some of them gathered in the 'Politico-Military Talks'. He was the creator of the Editorial Historical. Seiferheld's works during his last years were the most prolific in the field of culture. He died after a long illness on June 3, 1988, aged 37 years. He was a correspondent for the Associated Press news agency and the U.S. Times magazine.

Typically, these results concern the approximation capabilities of the feedforward architecture on the space of continuous functions between two Euclidean spaces, and the approximation is with respect to the compact convergence topology. However, there are also a variety of results between non-Euclidean spaces and other commonly used architectures and, more generally, algorithmically generated sets of functions, such as the convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, Zhou, Ding-Xuan (2020) Universality of deep convolutional neural networks; Applied and computational harmonic analysis 48.2 (2020): 787-794.

Sandberg (1991); Universal approximation using radial-basis-function networks; Neural computation 3.2, 246-257. or neural networks with specific properties.Yarotsky, Dmitry (2018); Universal approximations of invariant maps by neural networks. Most universal approximation theorems can be parsed into two classes. The first quantifies the approximation capabilities of neural networks with an arbitrary number of artificial neurons (\\"arbitrary width\\" case) and the second focuses on the case with an arbitrary number of hidden layers, each containing a limited number of artificial neurons (\\"arbitrary depth\\" case). Universal approximation theorems imply that neural networks can represent a wide variety of interesting functions when given appropriate weights. On the other hand, they typically do not provide a construction for the weights, but merely state that such a construction is possible. History One of the first versions of the arbitrary width case was proved by George Cybenko in 1989 for sigmoid activation functions.Cybenko, G. (1989) \\"Approximation by superpositions of a sigmoidal function\\", Mathematics of Control, Signals, and Systems, 2(4), 303‚Äì314. Kurt Hornik showed in 1991Kurt Hornik (1991) \\"\\", Neural Networks, 4(2), 251‚Äì257. that it is not the specific choice of the activation function, but rather the multilayer feed-forward architecture itself which gives neural networks the potential of being universal approximators. Moshe Leshno et al in 1993 and later Allan Pinkus in 1999 showed that the universal approximation property, as defined in , is equivalent to having a nonpolynomial activation function. The arbitrary depth case was also studied by number of authors, such as Zhou Lu et al in 2017, Boris Hanin and Mark Sellke in 2018, and Patrick Kidger and Terry Lyons in 2020. Several extensions of the theorem exist, such as to discontinuous activation functions, noncompact domains, certifiable networks and alternative network architectures and topologies. Arbitrary Width Case The classical form of the universal approximation theorem for arbitrary width and bounded depth is as follows.Haykin, Simon (1998). Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation, Volume 2, Prentice Hall. .Hassoun, M. (1995) Fundamentals of Artificial Neural Networks MIT Press, p. 48 It extends the classical results of George Cybenko and Kurt Hornik. > Fix a continuous function \\\\sigma:\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R} > (activation function) and positive integers d,D. The function \\\\sigma is not > a polynomial if and only if, for every continuous function > f:\\\\mathbb{R}^d\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^D (target function), every compact subset K of > \\\\mathbb{R}^d, and every \\\\epsilon >0 there exists a continuous function > f_{\\\\epsilon}:\\\\mathbb{R}^d\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^D (the layer output) with > representation : f_{\\\\epsilon} = W_2 \\\\circ \\\\sigma \\\\bullet W_1, where > W_2,W_1 are composable affine maps and \\\\bullet denotes component-wise > composition, such that the approximation bound : \\\\sup_{x \\\\in K}\\\\, \\\\ f( x ) > - f_{\\\\epsilon} ( x ) \\\\ < \\\\varepsilon holds for any \\\\epsilon arbitrarily > small (distance from f to f_\\\\epsilon can be infinitely small). The theorem states that the result of first layer f_\\\\epsilon can approximate any well-behaved function f. Such a well-behaved function can also be approximated by a network of greater depth by using the same construction for the first layer and approximating the identity function with later layers. Arbitrary Depth Case The 'dual' versions of the theorem consider networks of bounded width and arbitrary depth. A variant of the universal approximation theorem was proved for the arbitrary depth case by Zhou Lu et al. in 2017. They showed that networks of width n+4 with ReLU activation functions can approximate any Lebesgue integrable function on n-dimensional input space with respect to L^{1} distance if network depth is allowed to grow. It was also shown that there was the limited expressive power if the width was less than or equal to n. All Lebesgue integrable functions except for a zero measure set cannot be approximated by ReLU networks of width n. In the same paper it was shown that ReLU networks with width n+1 were sufficient to approximate any continuous function of n-dimensional input variables:Hanin, B. (2018). Approximating Continuous Functions by ReLU Nets of Minimal Width. arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.11278. > Universal approximation theorem (L1 distance, ReLU activation, arbitrary > depth). For any Lebesgue-integrable function f : \\\\mathbb { R } ^ { n } > \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb { R } and any \\\\epsilon > 0, there exists a fully- > connected ReLU network \\\\mathcal { A } with width d _ { m } \\\\leq {n + 4}, > such that the function F_{\\\\mathcal { A }} represented by this network > satisfies : \\\\int _ { \\\\mathbb { R } ^ { n } } \\\\left f ( x ) - F _ { \\\\mathcal > { A } } ( x ) \\\\right \\\\mathrm { d } x < \\\\epsilon Another variant was given by Patrick Kidger and Terry Lyons in 2020: > Universal approximation theorem (nonaffine activation, arbitrary depth). Let > \\\\varphi:\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} be any nonaffine continuous function which > is continuously differentiable at at least one point, with nonzero > derivative at that point. Let K \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R}^n be compact. The space > of real vector-valued continuous functions on K is denoted by C(K; > \\\\mathbb{R}^m). Let \\\\mathcal{N} denote the space of feedforward neural > networks with n input neurons, m output neurons, and an arbitrary number of > hidden layers each with n + m + 2 neurons, such that every hidden neuron has > activation function \\\\varphi and every output neuron has the identity as its > activation function. Then given any \\\\varepsilon>0 and any f\\\\in C(K; > \\\\mathbb{R}^m), there exists F \\\\in \\\\mathcal{N} such that :  F( x ) - f ( x > )  < \\\\varepsilon for all x\\\\in K. In other words, \\\\mathcal{N} is dense in > C(K; \\\\mathbb{R}^m) with respect to the uniform norm. Certain necessary conditions for the bounded width, arbitrary depth case have been established, but there is still a gap between the known sufficient and necessary conditions.

A foreign policy journalist and former partner at the global consultancy Control Risks, he is author of The Reckoning: Debt, Democracy and the Future of American Power, published in 2012 by Palgrave Macmillan. He is co-author of 'The Fastest Billion: The Story Behind Africa's Economic Revolution'. Moran served as Editor-in-Chief at the investment bank Renaissance Capital and has been a collaborator of renowned economist Nouriel Roubini as well commentator for Slate, the BBC and NBC News. He is also an adjunct professor of journalism at Bard College, a Visiting Fellow in Peace and Security at the Carnegie Corporation of New York, and conceived of and served as executive producer of the award-winning Crisis Guides documentary series for the Council on Foreign Relations. Biography Moran's career has included periods at major media outlets: Senior correspondent, MSNBC.com (2003‚Äì05); senior producer, International News and Special Reports, MSNBC.com (1996‚Äì2003); U.S. affairs analyst, BBC World Service (1993‚Äì96); senior editor, Radio Free Europe (1990‚Äì93), former reporter for Associated Press, St. Petersburg Times, Sarasota Herald-Tribune (1985‚Äì88). Moran also served as Hearst New Media Fellow at Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism and was a longtime board member of the Overseas Press Club, as well as a judge of its annual awards. His work has appeared in The New York Times, The Washington Post, Newsweek, The Economist, The Spectator (UK), The Guardian, The New Leader, and has spoken on National Public Radio and in many other outlets. He has lectured at dozens of universities and think tanks around the world. From 2005 to June 2009, he served as executive editor of CFR.org, the website of the Council on Foreign Relations. Moran was a foreign affairs columnist for Globalpost.com, and a member of the communications advisory board of Human Rights Watch. From 2009 to May 2011, he served as vice president, executive editor and senior geostrategy analyst at Roubini Global Economics, the macro/strategy consultancy founded by economist Nouriel Roubini. Publications Moran's book, The Reckoning: Debt, Democracy and the Future of American Power, was published in 2012 by Palgrave Macmillan. In the book, Moran argues that US policymakers reacted incorrectly to the 2008 financial crisis, exacerbating US problems, but that demographics and cultural factors still make the US the economy to watch in the 21st century - a good thing for the many smaller countries who undervalue the role American influence and power plays in their own economic stability. Starting in 2008, Moran led a team that received a series of Emmy awards for documentary work. In 2008, he served as Executive Producer of a team that won a News & Documentary Emmy award for Crisis Guide: Darfur, an interactive multimedia feature on the humanitarian crisis in Sudan's Darfur region. He repeated the following year (2009), winning the Emmy in the \\"New Approaches to Business and Financial Coverage\\" category for Crisis Guide: The Global Economy. In April 2011, \\"Crisis Guide: Pakistan\\" received an Overseas Press Club award. In 2012, Moran and his team won its third Emmy with Crisis Guide: Iran, the final in the series. As a columnist, Moran may be best known for his work during his years at MSNBC.com, Brave New World. One column in particular, written in December, 1999, was entitled \\"Times's Up for the Taliban\\" and, citing the threat Osama bin Laden presented to major cities in the United States, advocated a U.S.-led coalition of like-minded states invade and capture the al-Qaida leader. He broke the 2004 story of inadequate armor on American Humvee patrol vehicles, a revelation which, combined with the quick, angry response of service parents, ultimately forcing the Pentagon to spend tens of millions to \\"back-armor\\" the vehicles. Jack H. Jacobs, a retired U.S. Army colonel awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor during the Vietnam War, said of Moran's Humvee reporting was \\"an important story that helped save countless lives.

She struggled with friendship, her parents' near divorce, and the pressures of high school without a boyfriend. In her second last year of high school she broke into the popular crowd; however, she realized that being popular is not all it was cut out to be. When she began dating her long-term crush, Josh Miller, she soon discovered the relationship put her into compromising situations. Having recently committed her life to God, she then made another vow to 'kiss dating goodbye' in order to protect herself from compromising her convictions. While Josh and Caitlin did not date, they remained good friends. In college she was a role model for younger girls, particularly Josh's little sister, Chloe Miller. The fifth and final book, \\"I do,\\" Josh proposed to her. *Josh Miller is Chloe's older brother and Caitlin O'Connor's high school sweetheart and husband. First appearing in 'Becoming Me', Book 1 of the Caitlin O'Connor series, he is initially a jerk who breaks Caitlin's heart. Described as having 'Matt Damon good looks,' Josh is a typical high school jock. In college, he matures, eventually becoming a youth pastor and marrying Caitlin. *Chloe Miller was featured in the next series of books following Caitlin O'Connor. During these books, Chloe formed and became the leader of an all-girl Christian rock band and went on a tour of the United States with another Christian band. Problems arose when she became romantically involved with the other band's leader, an older boy with a girlfriend at home. *Kim Peterson was adopted as an infant from Korea and raised as an only child.

It is located at the south end of State Route 96 and the Pleasant Valley Branch of the Union Pacific Railroad (ex-D&RGW;). History Clear Creek was founded in the 1870s as a logging camp that supplied lumber to the nearby mining town of Winter Quarters. About twenty years after Clear Creek was founded, coal was discovered beneath the town and a mine was developed. In 1898, the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad built a spur line from Scofield to the mine at Clear Creek. Two years later, the Utah Fuel Company built 25 homes, a hotel, a store, a hospital, a schoolhouse, a workshop, and a water plant in the town. From 1910‚Äì1920, 2,000 tons of coal was being mined per day, and Clear Creek had about 600 residents. In 1930, the need for coal began to decrease, and by 1955, the mine had cut production and the town's population had decreased to 150. According to the 2010 Census, there were four people residing in town. The town is currently used as a recreation and camp area for various schools and programs, with cabins, a restroom and shower area, and a recreation and eating area. =Climate= Clear Creek has a warm-summer humid continental climate (K√∂ppen Dfb), bordering on subarctic (Dfc).

The plantation was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on May 22, 1978. History The land on which Mary Point Estate is located was originally held by Danish West India and Guinea Company officials during the early years of Danish settlement. Not being prime land for planting, the land was held until new settlers needed property. The van Stell family was the first controlling landholding on Mary's Point. In the aftermath of the 1733 slave insurrection on St. John, Franz Claasen was deeded the Mary's Point estate for alerting the family of the rebellion and assisting in their escape to St. Thomas, a nearby island. Franz Claasen's land deed was recorded on August 20, 1738 by Jacob van Stell. Claasen was the first \\"Free Colored\\" landowner on St. John. Augustus Kragh and the Grancis family were owners of the Mary Point Estate during the late 18th century. Hans Hendrik Berg, a governor and president of St. John and St. Thomas, was an owner of the Mary Point Estate during the 19th century. During this time an L-shaped factory and the one-story Great House were constructed on the property. In addition to the Great House, a servant's quarters, farm building, and cemetery remain.

In 1985, while a faculty member at Acadia University, his published doctoral dissertation Prelude to Quebec's Quiet Revolution was nominated for the Governor General's Award for English-language non-fiction.

The patterns of the 2004, 2006, and 2008 elections and the continuance of Harper's government, argues Behiels, has led many of Canada's political experts to the conclusion that a new political party paradigm has emerged.

RK was founded by Lowell Feld and Eric Grim in January 2005 with one of the main goals being to help \\"raise\\" Democratic Lieutenant Governor Tim Kaine to the position of Governor of Virginia. (The term \\"raising Cain\\" is an informal term for causing trouble.) In addition, the blog aimed to help elect other Democrats in Virginia, while promoting progressive causes and values. At its peak, RK had an average monthly traffic of about 80,000-100,000 visits. As with many leading state and local blogs, RK runs on the SoapBlox software. In late 2008, the blog ceased operations.

The other major source of content was the myriad comments posted in response to front page entries and diaries. Comments for popular or controversial diaries or front page threads could run into the thousands. Front page entries and diaries often took the form of a news story from an outside source interspersed with commentary from the author of the diary or post. Sometimes these stories contained a request for action from other members of the community, such as to get involved with a particular campaign, give money to a candidate or contact an elected official about an issue. Some front page entries were called \\"open threads,\\" which were open platforms for comments on any issue. One of the most popular versions of these open threads were \\"live threads\\" of commentary on important events happening in real time, such as debates or elections. Webb for Senate campaign During the 2006 US election cycle, RK helped found the \\"Draft James Webb\\" movement, an effort to draft Marine Corps veteran Jim Webb to run for US Senate against George Allen. The movement was ultimately successful, with Webb declaring his candidacy, defeating businessman Harris Miller in the Democratic primary, and defeating Allen in the general election over the course of the year. Throughout the campaign, RK was a major proponent of Jim Webb's nomination and election.

The theorem is named after Paul Erd≈ës and Wolfgang Heinrich Johannes Fuchs, who published it in 1956. Statement Let \\\\mathcal{A}\\\\subseteq\\\\mathbb{N} be an infinite subset of the natural numbers and r_{\\\\mathcal{A},h}(n) its representation function, which denotes the number of ways that a natural number n can be expressed as the sum of h elements of \\\\mathcal{A} (taking order into account). We then consider the accumulated representation function s_{\\\\mathcal{A},h}(x) := \\\\sum_{n\\\\leqslant x} r_{\\\\mathcal{A},h}(n), which counts (also taking order into account) the number of solutions to k_1 + \\\\cdots + k_h \\\\leqslant x, where k_1,\\\\ldots,k_h \\\\in \\\\mathcal{A}. The theorem then states that, for any given c>0, the relation s_{\\\\mathcal{A},2}(n) = cn + o\\\\left(n^{1/4}\\\\log(n)^{-1/2} \\\\right) cannot be satisfied; that is, there is no \\\\mathcal{A}\\\\subseteq\\\\mathbb{N} satisfying the above estimate.  Theorems of Erd≈ës‚ÄìFuchs type  The Erd≈ës‚ÄìFuchs theorem has an interesting history of precedents and generalizations. In 1915, it was already known by G. H. Hardy that in the case of the sequence \\\\mathcal{Q}:=\\\\\\\\{0,1,4,9,\\\\ldots\\\\\\\\} of perfect squares one has \\\\limsup_{n\\\\to +\\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\lefts_{\\\\mathcal{Q},2}(n)- \\\\pi n\\\\right}{n^{1/4}\\\\log(n)^{1/4}} > 0 This estimate is a little better than that described by Erd≈ës‚ÄìFuchs, but at the cost of a slight loss of precision, P. Erd≈ës and W. H. J. Fuchs achieved complete generality in their result (at least for the case h=2). Another reason this result is so celebrated may be due to the fact that, in 1941, P. Erd≈ës and P. Tur√°n conjectured that, subject to the same hypotheses as in the theorem stated, the relation s_{\\\\mathcal{A},2}(n) = cn + O(1) could not hold. This fact remained unproven until 1956, when Erd≈ës and Fuchs obtained their theorem, which is even stronger than the previously conjectured estimate. = Improved versions for h = 2 = This theorem has been extended in a number of different directions. In 1980, A. S√°rk√∂zy considered two sequences which are \\"near\\" in some sense. He proved the following: * Theorem (S√°rk√∂zy, 1980). If \\\\mathcal{A} = \\\\\\\\{a_1 < a_2 <\\\\ldots\\\\\\\\} and \\\\mathcal{B} = \\\\\\\\{b_1 < b_2 < \\\\ldots\\\\\\\\} are two infinite subsets of natural numbers with a_i - b_i = o\\\\big(a_i ^{1/2}\\\\log(a_i)^{-1} \\\\big), then \\\\\\\\{(i,j):a_i+b_j \\\\leqslant n\\\\\\\\} = cn + o\\\\big(n^{1/4}\\\\log(n)^{-1/2} \\\\big) cannot hold for any constant c > 0. In 1990, H. L. Montgomery and R. C. Vaughan were able to remove the log from the right-hand side of Erd≈ës‚ÄìFuchs original statement, showing that s_{\\\\mathcal{A},2}(n) = cn + o(n^{1/4}) cannot hold. In 2004, G. Horv√°th extended both these results, proving the following: * Theorem (Horv√°th, 2004). If \\\\mathcal{A}=\\\\\\\\{a_1 and \\\\mathcal{B}=\\\\\\\\{b_1 are infinite subsets of natural numbers with a_i-b_i = o\\\\big(a_i^{1/2}\\\\big) and \\\\mathcal{A}\\\\cap[0,n] - \\\\mathcal{B}\\\\cap[0,n] = O(1), then \\\\\\\\{(i,j):a_i+b_j \\\\leqslant n\\\\\\\\} = cn + o\\\\big(n^{1/4} \\\\big) cannot hold for any constant c>0. = General case (h ‚â• 2) = The natural generalization to Erd≈ës‚ÄìFuchs theorem, namely for h \\\\geqslant 3, is known to hold with same strength as the Montgomery‚ÄìVaughan's version. In fact, M. Tang showed in 2009 that, in the same conditions as in the original statement of Erd≈ës‚ÄìFuchs, for every h \\\\geqslant 2 the relation s_{\\\\mathcal{A},h}(n) = cn + o(n^{1/4}) cannot hold. In another direction, in 2002, G. Horv√°th gave a precise generalization of S√°rk√∂zy's 1980 result, showing that * Theorem (Horv√°th, 2002) If \\\\mathcal{A}^{(j)}=\\\\\\\\{a^{(j)}_1 (j=1,\\\\ldots,k) are k (at least two) infinite subsets of natural numbers and the following estimates are valid: 1. a^{(1)}_i - a^{(2)}_i = o\\\\big((a^{(1)}_i) ^{1/2}\\\\log(a_i^{(1)})^{-k/2} \\\\big) 2. \\\\mathcal{A}^{(j)}\\\\cap[0,n] = \\\\Theta\\\\big(\\\\mathcal{A}^{(1)}\\\\cap[0,n]\\\\big) (for j=3,\\\\ldots,k) :then the relation: :\\\\\\\\{(i_1,\\\\ldots, i_k):a^{(1)}_{i_1}+\\\\ldots+a^{(k)}_{i_k} \\\\leqslant n,~ a^{(j)}_{i_j} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{A}^{(j)} (j =1,\\\\ldots,k)\\\\\\\\} = cn + o\\\\big(n^{1/4}\\\\log(n)^{1-3k/4} \\\\big) :cannot hold for any constant c >0. = Non-linear approximations = Yet another direction in which the Erd≈ës‚ÄìFuchs theorem can be improved is by considering approximations to s_{\\\\mathcal{A},h}(n) other than cn for some c>0.

Biography  He was the son of a shoemaker, James Murray. He worked for eleven years for two mercantile firms, while studying in the evenings at the Glasgow School of Art under Robert Greenlees, finally devoting himself full-time to an artistic career from about 1875. He became an Associate of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1881, moving to London in 1882 where he was an immediate success. His 'My Love has gone a-Sailing' exhibited in 1884 was purchased by the Chantrey Trustees for the Tate Gallery. In 1891 Murray was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy, and a full member of the Royal Academy in 1905. About 1886 he broadened his horizons and travelled to the continent, but all of his more characteristic work was done in Scotland or England. Murray was a member of Glasgow Art Club and exhibited in the club's annual exhibitions.Glasgow Herald article 4 December 1909 ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Glasgow Art Club ‚Äì Interesting Exhibition‚Äô‚Äô Retrieved 2011-08-17 Glasgow Herald article 3 March 1923 ‚Äò‚Äô Glasgow Art Club - a notable spring show‚Äô‚Äô Retrieved 2011-08-17 He became president of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours in succession to Sir James Linton in 1917; the year before he was knighted in 1918.

He worked on album covers for Eric Clapton, Cream, Donovan, The Hollies and Jimi Hendrix. Early years Ferris was born in 1948 in Hastings, England, where he grew up. He studied at Hastings College of Art, and focused on Pre- Raphaelite painting. This inspired his psychedelic photography style. \\"A Gift From A Flower to a Garden\\", the first Rock/Pop box set \\"Wear Your Love Like Heaven\\", front cover After school, Ferris signed up as a steward on a P&O; liner that went to Australia via India. After returning to England, he served two years with the Royal Air Force for his National Service (Conscription) as an aerial photographer. During this period he became friends with a fellow conscriptee who was a member of a Liverpool \\"Mersey Beat\\" group, and he was introduced for the first time to this type of music. He was invited back to Liverpool to see a new group ‚Äì The Beatles ‚Äì who were appearing at the Cavern Club and was introduced to them there. From that point, he was hooked on \\"Beat\\" music from which The Beatles took their name. After his military service, Ferris emigrated to Vancouver, Canada working as an assistant there to master photographer Harry Nygard. From Nygard, Karl learned the skills of composition, form and texture. He also began an involvement in the \\"Beatnik\\" lifestyle and began hanging out in coffee bars, listening to poetry readings and the progressive jazz of such artists as Miles Davis, Herbie Hancock, John Coltrane, Eric Dolphy and Ornette Coleman. He photographed his first music subjects at these gatherings for local newspapers and magazines. He also began to take fashion shots of girlfriends and models, building up a respectable portfolio. Nygard told him that he had a real talent in this area, but to further expand his portfolio, he should return to London where the \\"Mod\\" fashion scene was creating new opportunities in the world of arts, music and fashion. In 1964 Karl returned to England and the \\"Happening\\" Beat scene. Ferris received commissioned work as a fashion and cover photographer for teen magazines 19, Honey, Petticoat, She and later for Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, Burda, French Mode and Marie Claire. These commissions brought him to such locations as Paris, Cannes, Munich, Ibiza and Morocco. When he wasn't working he would join into the \\"Scene\\", and after meeting (and eventually dating) Denmark's top \\"Superstar\\" model of the time (Maude Bertelsen), Karl was introduced to a Pop group called \\"The King Bees\\" who invited him to sing cover versions of Rolling Stones songs with them, and so he began touring in and around Copenhagen with this group. He eventually returned to England for a \\"fashion shoot\\" offer with Vogue. In 1966, The Beatles had just released \\"Rubber Soul\\" and Karl had the chance to meet up with their official photographer, Robert Freeman, who encouraged Ferris to experiment with different styles of images ‚Äì which he promptly did ‚Äì and created his unique psychedelic style. That summer on a trip to the Spanish island of Ibiza he discovered and began shooting the innovative psychedelic fashion work of designers Simon Posthuma and Marijke Koger ‚Äì aka The Fool ‚Äì and these photos were eventually printed in the fashion section of The Sunday Times. This was the first time such psychedelic photography and fashions had been seen anywhere. He and The Fool were then invited to come to London to shoot some more \\"Psychedelic\\" fashion features for other magazines, working from a shared studio in a former private dance theatre. There, they created \\"Art Happenings\\" with self played psychedelic music with Fashion shows, Freeform Dancing and Action painting, with Liquid Light and Photo slide projections superimposed on the performers by Karl Ferris who also shot music and fashion photos there. These Event parties became the talk of the Music and Art scene at the time and famous current Pop Stars and Artists would drop by and join in the action, \\"Drop In and Drop Out\\" was the common solgan used. Even the Beatles heard about the \\"Happenings\\" and came by and joined in. Also, Pink Floyd, Eric Clapton, The Cream, Donovan, T Rex, Mick Jagger, Grahman Nash, Graham Bond and artists Nigel Weymouth, Hapshas and the Coloured Coat, Peter Max and David Hockney dropped by. In 1967 Simon Posthuma and Marijke Koger with their colleges Josje Leger and Barry Finch aka \\"The Fool\\" were commissioned by The Beatles to paint their - \\"Apple Boutique\\" mural covering the entire building outside and in. Also they created a Psychedelic Fashion line that was to be sold inside the store, and Karl was there to photograph it all. and he was invited to do a stage \\"Liquid light show\\" for Pink Floyd, which is believed to be one of the first ever done in England. Jimi Hendrix 'Are You Experienced' - US Album Cover. Ferris was introduced to singer/guitarist Jimi Hendrix in 1967 through musician/producer Chas Chandler, who had \\"discovered\\" Hendrix. Hendrix then asked Ferris to be his photographer and to re-shoot the cover for the UK version of his album \\"Are You Experienced\\" ‚Äì which he was unhappy with ‚Äì for the US market. His images then appeared on all three US \\"Experience\\" album covers released during Hendrix's short life ‚Äì \\"Are You Experienced?\\", \\"Axis Bold As Love\\", \\"Electric Ladyland\\" and the Japanese \\"Smash Hits\\"...In the year 2000, Karl's Hampstead Studio 1968 shot of \\"The Jimi Hendrix Experience\\" was used as the Cover of the multi disc, purple velvet \\"Rolls Royce\\" Box Set. Ferris went on to create the album cover images for Donovan's \\"A Gift from a Flower to a Garden\\" (\\"Wear Your Love Like Heaven\\"/\\"For Little Ones\\") and the \\"Hurdy Gurdy Donovan\\" EP and (again, partnering with The Fool) for The Hollies' Evolution. He was also instrumental in creating their overall looks for the shoots, which then became their recognized public images. During the years 1967‚Äì69, Ferris was one of the preferred photographers to the British rock elite, shooting also many publicity photos for them. He was called \\"The Icon with the Nikon\\" by the musicians and Press back then. In 1968, Ferris accompanied Donovan on his US tour and was commissioned by Look to shoot a feature article on Donovan, after which he was retained as a 'Stringer' in Europe to shoot images for music articles there. In 1969, Karl's Donovan psychedelic shots were featured in an article in Twen, the famous German art magazine. 1970s‚Äì2000 Melonie Haller-Ferris, Playboy 1980 Ferris left London with his pregnant wife Anke in 1970 and went to live in Ibiza to bring up their son Lorien. Joni Mitchell visited Ferris in Ibiza in 1970 on the recommendation of Graham Nash and was photographed by Ferris. Ferris continued shooting fashion and glamour photographs for magazines in Europe and the USA. In 1980, Ferris received a commission from Playboy Magazine to photograph \\"Welcome Back Kotter\\" star Melonie Haller (John Travolta's love interest and the only female \\"Sweathog\\") for a \\"Celebrity Pictorial\\" in the famous Bo Derek issue.

The voltages produced are as high as 1.75 VDC in seawater. It is hypothesized that this voltage overwhelms the ampullary organ in sharks, producing a repellent action. Since bony fish lack the ampullary organ, the repellent is selective to sharks and rays. The process is electrochemical, so no external power input is required. As chemical work is done, the metal is lost in the form of corrosion. Depending on the alloy or metal utilized and its thickness, the electropositive repellent effect lasts up to 48 hours. The reaction of the electropositive metal in seawater produces hydrogen gas bubbles and an insoluble nontoxic hydroxide as a precipitate which settles downward in the water column.  History  SharkDefense made the discovery of electrochemical shark repellent effects on May 1, 2006 at South Bimini, Bahamas at the Bimini Biological Field Station. An electropositive metal, which was a component of a permanent magnet, was chosen as an experimental control for a tonic immobility experiment by Eric Stroud using a juvenile lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris). It was anticipated that this metal would produce no effect, since it was not ferromagnetic. However, a violent rousing response was observed when the metal was brought within 50 cm of the shark's nose. The experiment was repeated with three other juvenile lemon sharks and two other juvenile nurse sharks (Ginglymostoma cirratum), and care was taken to eliminate all stray metal objects in the testing site. Patrick Rice, Michael Herrmann, and Eric Stroud were present at this first trial. Mike Rowe, from Discovery Channel‚Äôs Dirty Jobs series, subsequently witnessed and participated in a test using an electropositive metal within 24 hours after the discovery.Video of test with electropositive metal In the next three months, a variety of transition metals, lanthanides, post-transition metals, metalloids, and non-metal samples were screened for rousing activity using the tonic immobility bioassay in juvenile lemon sharks and juvenile nurse sharks. All behaviors were scored from 0 to 4 depending on the response. It was determined that Group I, II, III, and Lanthanide metals all produced rousing responses, but the average score generally increased with electropositivity.AES 2007 Abstract: The Use of Highly Electropositive Metals as Shark Repellents. Eric Stroud, Patrick Rice, Craig O'Connell, Samuel Gruber Further testing using salt bridge electrochemical cells were conducted during 2006 and 2007 at the Oak Ridge Shark Lab. Using seawater as the electrolyte and a shark fin clipping as the cathode, voltages measured closely correlated with the standard reduction potential of the metal under test. SharkDefense now hypothesizes that a net positive charge from the cations produced by the electropositive metals accumulate on the electronegative skin of the shark. The net increase of the charge on the shark's skin is perceived by the ampullae of Lorenzini, and above 1.2 eV potential, aversion is produced. Electropositive metals are reducing agents and liberate hydrogen gas in seawater via hydrolysis, producing a half-cell voltage of about ‚àí0.86 eV. Simultaneously, an insoluble metal hydroxide precipitate is produced, which is inert for shark repellent activity. As such, metal is lost to corrosion in the process of generating cations. SharkDefense conducted corrosion loss studies in 2008 at South Bimini, Bahamas, and found that a 70 gram piece of a custom electropositive alloy retained more than 50% of its original weight after 70 hours of immersion. Losses due to corrosion are heavily a function of temperature, therefore, the cold seawater at fishing depths serves to reduce the corrosion rate.AES 2008 Abstract: Advances in Shark Repellent Research Using Highly Electropositive Metals. Eric Stroud, Patrick Rice, Craig O'Connell, Samuel Gruber  Research and testing  Stoner and Kaimmer (2008)\\"Reducing elasmobranch bycatch: Laboratory investigation of rare earth metal and magnetic deterrents with spiny dogfish and Pacific halibut\\". Stoner, Allan W. and Kaimmer, Stephen M. Fisheries Research, 2008. reported success using cerium mischmetal and Pacific spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias, a type of shark) in captivity, both with tonic immobility and feeding preference tests. Lead metal was used as a control. Encouraged by the results, a longline study was conducted off Homer, Alaska in late 2007 with the cooperation of the International Pacific Halibut Commission. Again, lead was used as a control. This study found a 17% reduction in Pacific spiny dogfish catch, and a 48% reduction in clearnose skate catch. However, Tallack et al. reported that cerium mischmetal was entirely ineffectiveTallack, M.S.L & J. Mandelman, (in prep). Do rare earth metals deter spiny dogfish? A feasibility study on the use of Mischmetals to reduce dogfish catches in hook and lobster gear in Gulf of Maine. against Atlantic spiny dogfish in the Gulf of Maine. Mandelman et al. reported that the repellent effect disappeared after starvation using captive Atlantic spiny dogfish, and that a species-specific variation in response to the mischmetals exist between captive Atlantic spiny dogfish and dusky smoothhounds (Mustelis canis).AES 2008 Abstract: The Shifting Baseline of Threshold Feeding Responses to Electropositive Metal Deterrents in Two Species of Dogfish. John Mandelman, Michael Stratton, Michael Tlusty, Shelly Tallack, Tom Fisher, Cheryl Harary, Nils Wernerfelt Stroud (SharkDefense, 2006) and Fisher (VIMS) observed captive cownose rays (Rhinoptera bonasus) changing swim elevation and ignoring blue crab baits in cages that contained neodymium-praseodymium mischmetal. The position of the treatment cages were alternated, and all cages were placed in the swim path of the rays. Brill et al. (2008) reported that captive juvenile sandbar sharks (Carcharhinus plumbeus) maintained a 50‚Äì60 cm clearance in their swimming patterns when a piece of neodymium-praseodymium mischmetal was placed in the tank. Wang, Swimmer, and Laughton (2007) reported aversive responses to neodymium- praseodymium mischmetals placed near baits offered to adult Galapagos (C. galapagensis) and Sandbar sharks on bamboo poles in Hawaii. In July 2008 Richard Brill of NMFS/VIMS and SharkDefense both conducted more at-sea trials with electropositive metals in an effort to reduce shark bycatch in commercial fisheries. As of August 2, 2008, Brill reported nearly a 3:1 reduction in sandbar shark catch when plastic decoys were compared to metals. A high statistical significance was obtained, as reported in the Virginian-Pilot by Joanne Kimberlin. SharkDefense later developed a simple on-hook treatment and a bait attachment which were being tested on Atlantic longlining vessels in 2008. Favaro and Cole (2013) determined through meta-analysis that electropositive metals did not reduce elasmobranch by-catch in commercial long-line fisheries, which raises concerns on the effectiveness of this approach as a shark deterrent or repellent to protect water users.  Selectivity  As expected, teleosts (bony fish) are not repelled by the electropositive metal's cation liberation in seawater. This is because teleosts lack the ampullae of Lorenzini. Teleost response was confirmed using captive Cobia (Rachycentron canadum) and Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis). In July 2008 swordfish (Xiphias gladius) catch was reported on experimental hooks treated with electropositive metal.  Limitations  As with all shark repellents, 100% effectiveness will not be achieved with electropositive metals. The metals are particularly effective when the shark is relying on its electrosense. It is likely that electropositive metals are ineffective for deliberately stimulated (chummed) sharks, competitively feeding sharks, and shark \\"frenzies\\". The metals are very useful in the environment of commercial fisheries, and possibly recreational and artisanal fisheries.

He intended to dispatch a separate force simultaneously to distract the defending Native American coalition. Delays in preparations caused St. Clair to initiate Wilkinson's raid prior to the main body's advance, however. Lieutenant Colonel Wilkinson had served under Brigadier General Charles Scott during the Blackberry Campaign of Spring 1791, in which mounted Kentucky militia raided Native American villages along the Wabash River and its tributaries. That campaign was considered a great success, and many called for a second raid before the end of Summer. Wilkinson's force of 523 Kentucky militia departed Fort Washington on 1 August 1791.Ward, 116 They covered about 70 miles in two and a half days, and arrived at Kenapacomaqua on 7 August 1791. Wilkinson immediately crossed the Eel River and attacked. Unknown to Wilkinson, the village was lightly defended. Alexander McKee had called a Grand Council of the Western Confederacy, and other leaders were travelling to Quebec for a meeting with Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester and Joseph Brant. The remaining residents were suffering from a severe flu-like illness, which- according to one British observer- caused them to bury two or three people each day. Thirty-four Miami prisoners were taken prisoner, mostly women and children. One of the captives was a daughter of Miami war chief Little Turtle. In addition, one U.S. captive was found at Kenapacomaqua and released. According to that captive, only eight warriors had remained at the village. Sixty warriors were patrolling the Wabash River, while others were at Vincennes purchasing ammunition or gathering food in the forests. Two Kentuckians were killed and another wounded. Nine Miami died in the encounter. By Wilkinson's own account, the Miami dead included only six warriors.Wilkinson's account of the expedition is found at Indiana University, Glenn Black Laboratory, American State Papers, Indian Affairs, March 3, 1789 to March 3, 1815, vol. 1, p. 134. Another account is found in James Handasyd Perkins and John Mason Peck, Annals of the West (1857) pp. 569-570. Two of the dead were women. One was a child. Wilkinson cut down the corn crops and burned the village houses. The militia made camp for the night, but decided not to proceed further due to fear of retaliation. Wilkinson followed the same route to Kentucky used by General Scott months earlier, stopping at Ouiatenon to destroy the crops newly planted since the June raid. Aftermath The Western Confederacy was enraged by the attack and sent calls to war. Within weeks, news arrived that the United States had begun a larger advance north from Fort Washington. Observers at Fort Detroit noted a constant stream of Native Americans going to war. Wilkinson exaggerated the report of his raid, claiming to have destroyed \\"the chief town\\" of the Wea. Although Wilkinson's success is now credited to circumstances which left Kenapacomaqua lightly defended, General St. Clair and President George Washington were both pleased with Wilkinson's raid. Secretary of War Henry Knox considered both the Blackberry Campaign and the Battle of Kenapacomaqua a success, writing \\"The consternation arising from the demonstration of their being within our reach must all tend to the great object, the establishment of peace.\\" As a reward, Wilkinson was given command of the Second United States Regiment during the main campaign that October. Ironically, Governor Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester urged peace that same August at his conference, held at the Chateau St. Louis in Quebec. The American Indian council departed with terms of peace to present to the United States. When the council arrived at Fort Detroit, however, they received news of Wilkinson's raid and St. Clair's advance. The entire council immediately departed to defend Kekionga, which ended on 4 November 1791 with St. Clair's Defeat, one of the worst defeats in U.S. Army history. The Northwest Indian War would continue another four years.

On 24 August, the net laying ship steamed to Melville, Rhode Island, for shakedown training which she completed on 11 September. After operating in the 5th Naval District out of Norfolk, Virginia, for two months, the net layer got underway on 16 November for the U.S. West Coast. She transited the Panama Canal on 27 November and reached San Francisco, California, on 20 December 1944. On 26 January 1945, Terebinth headed for Hawaii and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 7 February. The following week, the net layer joined a convoy which proceeded, via Johnston Island and Eniwetok, to Ulithi. She was there from 6 to 11 March when she joined units of Mine Squadron 10 bound for the Philippines. The ships arrived at San Pedro Bay 10 days later, prepared for the invasion of the Ryukyu Islands, and sortied on 19 March. They arrived off Kerama Retto on 26 March, and troops of the 77th Infantry Division landed on the beaches there at 0800 that morning. By afternoon, the main islands of the group were under American control, and Terebinth began net laying operations in the Aka Shima channel. The northern mooring was completed in the afternoon, and the last of the net was in place before nightfall. The southern mooring was completed the next morning. =Terebinth survives attack= The invasion fleet came under enemy air attack on the first day of the campaign, and raids continued throughout the struggle for the island. A new hazard appeared on the morning of 28 March when lookouts on Terebinth sighted an unlighted boat approaching the ship's starboard bow. When challenged, the craft did not reply. Since the unidentified vessel was too close for Terebinth to bring her 3-inch gun to bear, the ship's gunners opened fire with small arms. The boat dropped a depth charge near Terebinth, veered to starboard, and sped off as a violent explosion shook the net layer. Terebinth was not damaged. She then took station at the eastern side of the southern net entrance to Kerama Retto and directed traffic as it entered. The ship remained at this task until 6 April when she joined a salvage group off the Hagushi beaches to aid in retrieving landing craft. On 29 March, she went alongside the damaged and supplied the transport with electricity for four days while it attended to the needs of wounded men who had been evacuated from the beaches. Terebinth remained in the Ryukyus until 6 July when she retired to Leyte. =End-of-war operations= Terebinth departed San Pedro, California, on 12 August and was approximately south of Peleliu on 15 August when she received orders to cease offensive operations against Japan. Two days later, she anchored at Ulithi and began repairing, replacing, and salvaging buoys and nets. She then moved to Kossol Roads in the Palaus to continue the same tasks. On 14 October, the net laying ship set course for Tanapag harbor, Saipan, with a load of nets. She arrived there on 19 October and got underway for the United States on 26 October. Post-war decommissioning Terebinth arrived at San Diego on 27 November 1945 and, the next day, moved up the coast to San Pedro for inactivation. She was decommissioned on 31 January 1946 and struck from the Navy list on 26 February 1946. The ship was sold to Van Camp Sea Food Company, San Pedro, California, on 23 April 1946. Honors and awards Terebinth received one battle star for her participation in the Okinawa campaign.

Later he studied wood sculpture and cabinetmaker crafts in √àcole Boulle. In 1935 he held his first personal exhibition. After completing his studies in France Jonynas returned to Lithuania. His illustration for Kristijonas Donelaitis Metai became classics of the genre. At the time he was teaching at Kaunas Art School. In 1937 he was elected as a member of the International Sculpture Commission. The same year Jonynas was awarded Golden medal in the international exhibition in Paris for his woodcarvings and posters. In 1938 he was awarded a Cross of Order of the French Legion of Honour.

It was designed by Bruce Shelley and published by Avalon Hill in 1987. The game puts the player in command of an M4 Sherman tank belonging to George Patton's 4th Armoured Division in Northern Europe. The game is played on an abstract map which portraits hypotethical territory in Normandy, several tables and a depiction of the tank, on which the player puts cardboard counters to indicate the actions performed by each member of the crew, the kind of ammunition currently loaded in the main gun, the current state of hatches, turret and gun orientation, and other information. A game is played in turns, each one corresponding to 15 minutes of real time: when random die rolls indicate that combat occurs the action switches to combat rounds, during which the player directs the actions of each crew member (driver, assistant driver, gunner, loader and commander himself) moving the tank and firing its weapons, while the randomly determined enemy reacts with actions determined by random die rolls influenced by what the player does. The player wins by earning victory points by knocking out enemy units and capturing enemy territory, and preventing the enemy doing so. After a game is over the player has a chance to improve his tank, switching to a later or improved model, and to improve the skills of his crew. The game is quite detailed in terms of single-tank warfare simulation, including rules for machine guns, smoke deployment, target acquisition, enemy spotting, crew casualties.

Five years prior, the brothers had paid half that sum for their share.

Her grandmother, Elsba Mae Miller, a former English teacher, would often read and recite poetry to her, and Wolverton credits this for inspiring her love of language. Even as a child Wolverton was interested in the arts, especially writing, music, and drama; she graduated from the Performing Arts curriculum of Cass Technical High School in 1972. Terry Wolverton attended the University of Detroit as a student in its BFA Theatre Program. In 1973, she transferred to the University of Toronto, majoring in Theatre, Psychology, and Women's Studies. Wolverton participated in Sagaris, an independent institute for the study of feminist political theory, in 1975. She next enrolled in Thomas Jefferson College, an experimental school based at Grand Valley State Colleges in Western Michigan, and participated in its feminist Women, World, and Wonder program. Wolverton moved to Los Angeles in 1976, enrolling in the Feminist Studio Workshop at the Woman's Building. She spent the next thirteen years at the Woman's Building where, in addition to writing and performing, she was also instrumental in the Lesbian Art Project, the Incest Awareness Project, the Great American Lesbian Art Show (GALAS), a long-term performance project called \\"An Oral Herstory of Lesbianism\\", and a White Women's Anti- Racism Consciousness-Raising Group.

One notable writer that attended these workshops was Gil Cuadros, a Mexican-American poet who was diagnosed with AIDS in 1987. Cuadros started attending her writing workshops for people with HIV. It was because of Wolverton that Gil Cuadros was able to find a creative outlet to write for himself and his lover, John Edward Milosch, who died from AIDS in 1987. Shortly after, Cuadros published his only fictional book, City of God (1994). Wolverton played an important figure in Cuadros' life and career.

The predominant species of stingray in the inshore waters of the Hawaiian Islands, this benthic fish typically inhabits sandy or muddy flats at depths greater than . Usually growing to across, the broad stingray has a wide, diamond- shaped pectoral fin disc with a protruding snout tip and a long tail with a ventral fin fold. At night, this species actively forages for bottom-dwelling invertebrates and bony fishes, often near the boundaries of reefs. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous. As substantial threats to its population do not seem to exist, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed this species as least concern. Taxonomy and phylogeny American zoologist Samuel Garman described the broad stingray in an 1880 issue of the scientific journal Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, giving it the name Trygon lata from the Latin word for \\"broad\\".Hoover, J.P.

California Academy of Sciences. Retrieved on December 2, 2009. The type specimen was collected from what were then called the \\"Sandwich Islands\\", and measures across. Lisa Rosenberger's 2001 phylogenetic analysis of 14 Dasyatis species, based on morphological characters, found that the sister species of the broad stingray is the roughtail stingray (D. centroura), and that they form a clade with the southern stingray (D. americana) and the longtail stingray (D. longa). As D. centroura is found in the Atlantic, this suggests that it and D. lata evolutionarily diverged before or with the formation of the Isthmus of Panama (about 3 million years ago). Distribution and habitat The broad stingray has only been confirmed to occur around the Hawaiian Islands, where it is the most abundant stingray. A record of this species from off Taiwan has yet to be verified. Broad stingrays are common in coastal bays with mud or silt bottoms, including Ma'alaea Bay off the island of Maui and Kaneohe Bay off the island of Oahu, but may also be encountered in sandy areas or near coral reefs. It has been reported from depths of , though most are found deeper than . Description The tail of the broad stingray is very long, with a fin fold underneath. The broad stingray has a diamond-shaped pectoral fin disc a fourth wider than long, with nearly straight leading margins that converge at an obtuse angle, and curved trailing margins. The tip of the snout is rounded and protrudes past the disc. The mouth is arched and contains five or six papillae on the floor, two of which are in front of the others. The pelvic fins are short and rounded. The whip-like tail is twice or more the length of the disc, and bears a serrated stinging spine on the upper surface near the tail base. A long, narrow fin fold occurs beneath the tail, which eventually becomes a keel that runs all the way to the tail tip. Larger rays have three large, elongated tubercles in the middle of the back; the tail is roughened by small dermal denticles, along with an irregular row of conical tubercles on each side and several large, flattened tubercles in front of the spine. This species is plain olive to brown above and white below. Though rarely found so far west, the similar-looking diamond stingray (D. dipterura) is the only other nearshore stingray that occurs off Hawaii; it can be distinguished from this species by its tail, which is shorter and has both upper and lower fin folds. The broad stingray can reach across and in weight, though few exceed across.Dale, J. (2008). Life-History and Ecology of the Brown Stingray . HIMB Shark Lab. Retrieved on December 5, 2009. Biology and ecology The underside of a broad stingray During the day, the broad stingray is relatively inactive and spends much time lying half-buried on the bottom. A tracking study in Kaneohe Bay found that individuals rays roamed over an average area of at night, compared to an average diurnal activity space of , and did not rest consistently in any particular spot. Rays were most active 2 hours after sunset and before sunrise, and were more active in the higher water temperatures of summer than winter. The behavior of this species was not significantly influenced by tides, likely because they inhabit deeper water. The broad stingray feeds mainly on bottom-dwelling crustaceans, while also taking polychaete worms and small bony fishes. It excavates large pits to uncover buried prey, and is often followed by opportunists such as jacks. Foraging rays favor areas close to reef boundaries, where many parrotfish, wrasses, gobies, and other reef fishes shelter at night. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium chengi, Rhinebothrium hawaiiensis, Pterobothrium hawaiiensis, Prochristianella micracantha, and Parachristianella monomegacantha. Like other stingrays, the broad stingray is aplacental viviparous. Kaneohe Bay appears to be a nursery area for this species, where juvenile scalloped hammerheads (Sphyrna lewini) and it are the dominant predators. Human interactions The International Union for the Conservation of Nature has assessed the broad stingray as of least concern, as it faces no obvious threats from human activity and its range overlaps with several marine protected areas. This species has become a popular subject for display at public aquariums and resorts.

Biography Greer was born in Paris, Tennessee. He moved to Mississippi as a young man and took part in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War as a member of the 1st Mississippi Rifles, whose colonel was future Confederate President Jefferson Davis. He participated in the battles of Monterrey and Buena Vista. In 1848, Greer moved to Marshall, Texas, where he established himself as a planter and merchant, and for a time was a partner in a law firm. Three years later, he returned to Tennessee to marry a local girl named Anna Holcombe (whose famous sister Lucy Petway Holcombe married Francis Wilkinson Pickens, and became known during the Civil War as the \\"Queen of the Confederacy\\").McGehee, Larry T. \\"Iron Fist in a Velvet Glove,\\" August 5, 2002, Southern Seen, Wofford College web site Elkanah and Anna had five children.

After training and equipping his men, he led the regiment into combat at the battles of Wilson's Creek and Elkhorn Tavern in Arkansas. During the latter engagement, Greer was slightly wounded in the arm. In October 1862, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general and appointed as chief of the conscription bureau for the Trans-Mississippi region. Among his many responsibilities was trying to reconcile the laws of the central Confederate government with those of the State of Texas. In 1864, faced with a growing manpower shortage, the Confederacy formed a Reserve Corps department, and Greer commanded it for a time. After the war, he resumed his civilian career as a planter and merchant. He died during a visit with his sister in DeValls Bluff, Arkansas, on March 25, 1877.

NCHC has 1,342 members in the United States and abroad, providing support for institutions and individuals to develop and expand honors education. The organization has its national headquarters at The University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Through its annual conference, professional networking, and publications, NCHC provides a platform for honors curriculum development,http://www.nchchonors.org/honorscoursedesign.aspx Honors Course Design program assessment, national and international study opportunities,http://www.nchchonors.org/semestersforeignstudy.aspx Honors Semesters & Faculty Institutes internships, honors advising, scholarships, independent research, program assessment and job listings. NCHC also maintains links with regional and state honors organizations.  Mission  The National Collegiate Honors Council promotes academic opportunity for honors students and faculty at two-year and four-year undergraduate public and private colleges and universities. In recent years honors models have been developed in several countries, and international membership in the organization has expanded. Keyed to high-end students, it fosters an intellectual environment that values scholarship, creativity, and social engagement. NCHC is one of the few academic organizations in which students, faculty and administrators participate equally in shared experiences [4] . It has evolved developed several hallmark programs that bring participants from diverse institutions together expressly for integrative learning: City as Text‚Ñ¢ (shared explorations of urban settings), Honors Semesters (study abroad as a cohort of honors students and faculty), and Partners in the Parks (week-long adventures in American national parks). All have evolved as experiential‚Äîout-of- classroom‚Äîmodels of teaching and learning.  History  The concept of an honors education in the western university tradition can be traced to the establishment of ‚Äòpass‚Äô and ‚Äòhonors‚Äô degree designations at Oxford and Cambridge Universities in 1830. Harvard was the first American institution to offer a degree with honors. By the 1920s liberal arts colleges had developed honors curricula, and many departmental majors offered honors designations. By the late 1930s, over 100 honors programs existed in the United States, a number that remained stable until the Soviet launch of Sputnik in 1957; the ‚Äúspace race‚Äù that followed gave American educators the thrust needed to support enriched education for high-end students. In 1957, the Inter- University Committee on the Superior Student (ICSS) was formed as a clearinghouse for information on honors activities. ICSS received funds from the Carnegie Corporation, the National Science Foundation, and the U.S. Office of Education to help establish honors programs at colleges and universities across the United States. In 1965, ICSS disbanded when its external funding expired. Spearheaded by people committed to maintaining a professional association of honors educators, the National Collegiate Honors Council was formed in 1966. NCHC continues to grow as a resource and network for those involved in undergraduate honors education. Although honors programs and colleges are specific to individual institutions, all share a common philosophy of academic enrichment based on the theory that students profit from close contact with faculty, small courses, seminars or one-on-one instruction, individual research projects, internships, foreign study, and campus or community service. Officers and governance  NCHC is a non-profit (501c3) organization governed by a 24-member Board of Directors:http://www.nchchonors.org/nchcofficersboardstaff.aspx NCHC Board of Directors President, President-Elect, Vice-President, Immediate Past President, Secretary, Treasurer, and eighteen members at large elected by the membership, including six student members. The Executive Director is Mary Beth Rathe who works from the organization‚Äôs national office located on the campus of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The 2018 Office holders are: President Naomi Yavneh Klos, Loyola University New Orleans; President Elect Richard Badenhausen, Westminster College; Vice President Elaine Torda, Orange County Community College (SUNY); Immediate Past President Art Spisak, University of Iowa; Treasurer Steven Engel, Georgia Southern University and Secretary Kyoko Amano, Lock Haven University.  Publications  NCHC publishes two refereed journals and a monograph series. The Journal of the National College Honors Council (JNCHC) publishes scholarly articles on honors education. Honors in Practice (HIP) features articles on nuts-and-bolts operations and current practices in honors teaching and programming. The monograph series includes a variety of handbooks and texts addressing specific aspects of honors learning, teaching, and administration. These publications are indexed full-text in the following library databases: EBSCOhost, Gale and H.W. Wilson and are archived in the University of Nebraska-Lincoln‚Äôs Digital Commons repository.  Annual conference  Each fall, NCHC holds its annual conference in a major city in the United States. Honors educators and students gather for a variety of workshops and committee meetings as well as the opportunity to interact and exchange ideas. The conference is also open to non-members with an interest in honors education, such as high school college advisors seeking to place qualified students in honors programs. Among the workshops, Beginning in Honors, Developing in Honors, and Best Honors Administrative Practices are useful to people at particular stages in their career. Each conference also features student master classes in the arts, plenary speakers, City as Text‚Ñ¢, an experiential-learning exploration of the host city, and a Partners in the Parks exploration of a local National Park Service site.  Workshops  In addition to workshops offered at the annual conference, NCHC also hosts intensive workshops and institutes throughout the year on faculty development and on assessment and evaluation. Faculty development workshops are keyed to culture and environment in specific site locations. Recent workshops have taken place in Las Vegas/Death Valley, Kentucky Cave Country, and Santa Fe, New Mexico.  Recommended site visitors  NCHC maintains up-to-date listings of faculty and administrators willing to provide consulting services as external reviewers of honors programs and colleges. All site visitors have completed an NCHC Faculty Institute in assessment and evaluation.  Honors Semesters  Honors Semesters are designed to immerse highly motivated students in field studies, research, internships, and seminars at a host site. Past Honors Semesters have been in Washington, D.C., the Grand Canyon, New York City, El Paso, Appalachia, the Maine Coast, Iowa, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Greece, the Czech Republic, Spain, and the Southeast coast of the United States, on topics ranging from local culture to global concerns. Plans for another Grand Canyon Semester and a semester on Sustainable Development and Social Justice in Chile are in progress. Most recently, winter mini-semesters (winterims) have become popular, the latest taking place in the Peruvian Amazon.

Norton was born in 1923 in Asuncion, Paraguay on December 8, the day of the festival of the Virgin of Caacup√©, an important date for Paraguayans. His parents were Apolonio Benitez and Hermelinda Gonzalez. Early career Neneco got his start in music when he played trumpet in the battalion band of the Rojas Silva battalion of Salesianito, a private school in Asuncion. His lessons in elementary music theory were taken with Ernesto P√©rez Acosta. He learned theory and higher sight-reading with maestro Jose de Jesus Villalba, and then studied harmony with Professor Otakar Platill. While in the Rojas Silva battalion, he formed a musical group. Its members included Luis Meza Osmer, Rubito Medina on guitar, Benjamin Caba√±as on clarinet, and a singer who later would be famous: Luis Alberto del Paran√°. Norton was awarded the title of senior professor of theory and music theory at the Jorge Baez Conservatory. He formed his own orchestra, Los Caballeros del Ritmo, a remarkable grouping comprising Rudy Heyn, Chon Duarte, Paco Gomez, Victorio Ortiz and Nelson Mendoza. The band went on tour throughout Paraguay, as well as to cities in Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay. Song writing career Norton has written more than eighty compositions. The guarania \\"Aquel Ayer,\\" a renowned work, marked his first experience in the field of composition and was recorded by Luis Alberto del Paran√°, who catapulted it to success. He is the author of one of the most well known Paraguayan songs, \\"Paloma Blanca\\" (The White Dove). This song has been recorded by countless national and international performers, including Julio Iglesias. This success was joined by numerous compositions throughout his long career as a composer, conductor, and orchestral arranger. Other highlights include \\"Busc√°ndote\\" and \\"Tus Ojos\\". The song \\"Yo v√¨ un Amanecer,\\" with lyrics by journalist Humberto Rubin and with the voice of Ni√±o Pereira, represented Paraguay in the Third World Song Festival held in Rio de Janeiro. Singers such as Luis Alberto del Parana, Agust√≠n Barboza, Pura Ag√ºero Vera, √ëeco Gonzalez, and Oscar Barreto Aguayo sought the direction and orchestral arrangements of Norton for making records and for live presentations on television, radio, and in theaters. Singers such as Luis Alberto del Paran√°, Samuel Aguayo, Hannibal Lovera, Ramona Galarza, and Julio Iglesias; and groups such as Indios, Alberto y Los Trios Paraguayos, Los Gomez, and Los Tres Sudamericanos (Paraguayan); as well as Herminio Gim√©nez, Florent√≠n Gim√©nez, Luis Bord√≥n, and Bernardo Avalos have recorded compositions by Neneco Norton. Compositions for the stage In addition to writing songs, Neneco was devoted to compose musical works for the local theater, called Paraguayan Zarzuela. He collaborated with Paraguayan playwright and journalist Alcibiades Gonz√°lez Delvalle to create works such as Reseda, Naranjera, Ribere√±a, The Arribe√±os, La Morena, Del Trigal, El Delegado and Ca√±averal. Neneco also worked with playwright Mario Halley Mora in La Promesera of Caacup√© and Mustafa. With Cr√≠spulo Melgarejo he shared the authorship of Marido de Contrabando, El Gringo de la Loma and Escuela Pyhare. Librettist Rogelio Silverado was another creative companion of Neneco Norton. Their collaborations included the play La Candeladria de mi Barrio. Final years and Death Despite his age, in his final years Neneco Norton served as professor of Paraguayan popular folk music at the National Conservatory of Music and as a teacher in the school of Villa Elisa, Maria Auxiliadora School. He was an active member of the steering committee for the Autores Paraguayos Asociados (APA), and taught composition and the structure of Paraguayan music. He died on March 9th, 2013 at the age of 89 after being hospitalized for 2 months due to pneumonia complications.Fallece el maestro Neneco Norton Awards The Municipality of Asuncion gave Norton Neneco the distinction of beloved son of the capital city of Asuncion, because the city was one of the great inspirations for his work.

After a few attempts, she gains renown as a babysitter, and the calls come pouring in. One of her calls, however is to look after a fourteen-year-old (even though Chelsea is really only twelve) and his \\"72-month-old\\" brother.

It premiered in London on 13 September 1825 at the Haymarket Theatre and ran 114 performances. The play continued to be popular until the early 1870s. Synopsis The storyline is centered on a comical, idle, meddlesome and mischievous fellow consumed with curiosity. Unable to mind his own business, he's an interfering busybody who conveniently leaves behind an umbrella everywhere he goes in order to have an excuse to return and eavesdrop. At the end, however, Pry becomes a hero for rescuing papers from a well that incriminate more serious troublemakers. Cherry Ripe, the 17th-century English folk song to words by the English poet Robert Herrick, is adapted into the play. Analysis Rumors abounded that the Pry character was based on the eccentric Thomas (\\"Tommy\\") Hill, editor of the Dramatic Mirror, who took daily walks with Poole at Kensington Gardens. However, Poole was quoted in magazines as saying, > \\"The idea was really suggested by an old invalid lady who lived in a very > narrow street, and who amused herself by speculating on the neighbors, and > identifying them, as it were, by the sound of the knocks they gave... It was > not drawn from an individual, but from a class. I could mention five or six > persons who were contributors to the original play.\\" Productions John Liston as Paul Pry, circa 1825, from the collection of the Folger Shakespeare LibraryIn the original 1825 London production, Madame Vestris sang \\"Cherry Ripe\\", and John Liston portrayed the title character. His costume included striped pants, Hessian boots, top hat, and tailcoat. Liston's portrayal was so popular that images of Liston as Pry appeared on signs, shops, warehouses, handkerchiefs, and snuff boxes. Porcelain and pearlware factories in Staffordshire, Rockingham, Derby and Worcestershire produced figurines of Liston as Pry. The Liston as Pry image was even stamped on butter. The following year, in 1826, the play was produced in New York City at the Park Theatre, featuring Thomas Hilson. It was first produced in Australia in October 1835 at the Theatre Royal in Sydney, when Joseph Simmons took the title role. It returned to London's Adelphi Theatre, for the 1851-52 season, featuring Edward Richard Wright and Sarah Woolgar, receiving extensive, positive press comment.

The film is based on the life of Meera, a Hindu saint-poet who renounced princely comforts in pursuit of her love for Lord Krishna. The film portrays the life and times of Meera from a historical perspective rather than a mythological one. Through Meera's life, Gulzar has shown a woman's struggle to find her independence, dignity and spiritual satisfaction in a society where women are supposed to be worthy of only taking care of the household chores. The epic soundtrack by Pt. Ravi Shankar features the lilting dulcet tones of the award-winning playback singer Vani Jairam, the tunes of which resound in every memory that reveres this winning combination of film music. However the film did not perform well at the Indian box office, though it received critical acclaim. Plot The story is set around 1580, in the time of King Akbar. Biramdev (Dr Shreeram Lagoo) is the king of Medta, a province in Rajasthan. He has two daughters, Meera (Hema Malini) and Krishna (Vidya Sinha) and a son, Jaimal (Dinesh Thakur). Meera is in deep emotional love with Lord Krishna, so much so that she considers Lord Krishna to be her husband. Akbar (Amjad Khan) is becoming stronger day by day and hence other small provinces are trying to join against him. Medta, in one such political agreement, decides to join hands with Raja Vikramajit (Shammi Kapoor). As a part of this agreement Meera is married (against her wish) to Vikramajit's son, Rana Bhojraj (Vinod Khanna). But even after getting married her love for Lord Krishna remains the same and she follows her own ideals and way of living which are not very acceptable to Bhojraj and his family. One thing leads to another and one day Meera is declared as an outcast and traitor who failed to play a wife's duties towards her husband, a bride's duties towards her family, and a woman's duties towards society. She is jailed and a public trial is ordered to decide her fate. But Meera is still unshakable and her spirituality keeps her going. She is not even afraid of death. Finally she is given a death sentence and is ordered to drink a cup of venom in front of the public.

Doctrine The most important sources of Noorbakhshi doctrines are included within three books: Al-Fiqh al-Ahwat and Kitab al-Aitiqadia, both written by Muhammad Nurbakhsh Qahistani, and Dawat-e-Sofia, written by Ameer Kabir Syed Ali Hamdani, a Sufi preacher.Bashir, S: \\"Messianic Hope and Mystical Vision: The Nurbakhshiya Between Medieval and Modern Islam (Studies in Comparative Religion), \\"University of South Carolina Press\\", October 2003  History  In its country of origin, Iran, the order became outright Shi'a some decades after the Safavid dynasty made Twelver Shi'ism the religion of the state in 1501. The same partially occurred in Kashmir either during the lifetime of Shams ud-Din Iraqi, who died in 1527, or in the following decades, during the brief interlude of the Chak dynasty's reign. In Baltistan, the Sufia Nurbakhshiya still survive as a sect with doctrines of its own that combine elements of both Shi'ism and Sunni Sufi Islam.Reick Andreas: \\"The Sofia Nurbakhshis of Baltistan- Revival of the Oldest Muslim Community in the Northern Areas (Gilgit Baltistan) of Pakistan\\", Paper read at the International Conference \\"Karakurum-Himalaya-Hindukush-Dynamics of Change\\", Islamabad, National Library, 29.9-2.10.1995 and published in The Monthly Nawa- i-sufia Islamabad, Issue No. 28, March 1997. Muhammad Nurbakhsh Qahistani was the 15th-century Sufi master to whom researchers have paid less attention. Although Nurbakhsh had many scholar-disciples, including Assiri lahiji, none of his disciples made any serious effort to write Nurbakhsh's biography and to preserve his teachings. However, hundreds of thousands of his followers are still present in the most remote areas of Pakistan. They practise his teachings and are still the custodians of his works and teachings five centuries later.Dr. Naeem, G: \\"Mir Sayyid Muhammad Nurbakhsh and Nurbakhshiya Sect\\", Shah-e-Hamadan Publications, Islamabad, Pakistan, 2000 Nurbakhshis believe that the practices are not an assemblage of his personal views but were originally conceived by him from Muhammad through the masters of the spiritual chain. They state that anyone who questions this connection is invited to travel on the long road through the history of mysticism and to compare it with that of Nurbakhsh's teachings.Balghari S.H.\\"Shah Syed Muhammad Nurbakhsh Qahistani\\", Monthly Nawa-i-Sufia Islamabad, Issue No. 28, 1996 = Decline of Nurbakshi in Kashmir = Khanqah Shah Hamdan Srinagar, Kashmir was an important centre of Noorbakshi Muslims in Kashmir for many centuries. The dominance of Sunni Islam in the power corridors of Kashmir, after the period of Nurbakshi influence, was restored by Mirza Muhammad Haidar Dughlat when he conquered Kashmir. Dughlat sent Fiqh al-Ahwat to a Sunni council for its analysis, which resulted in a condemnatory fatwa by the council to ensure Orthodox Sunni and Shi'a Islam and tried to limit Sufi influence. Mir Danial Shaheed and other prominent figures were killed during the resulting clashes. The onslaught against the Nurbakshi led to bloodshed and the end of the once- popular Sunni Sufi order.

Seismic loading depends, primarily, on: * Anticipated earthquake's parameters at the site - known as seismic hazard * Geotechnical parameters of the site * Structure's parameters * Characteristics of the anticipated gravity waves from tsunami (if applicable).

His ceramics work received a variety of medals, including his 1862 exhibition in London, 1867 exhibition in Paris, and 1873 exhibit in Vienna.

In 1835 he published, with William Wyld, Voyage pittoresque dans la R√©gence d‚ÄôAlger (Paris, Charles Motte, 1835). In 1851, Lessore began his ceramics work in S√®vres, a southwestern suburb of Paris, France known for its porcelain manufacture. Lessore tapped into his artistic painting experience to produce a pair of large, decorated vases. These were purchased in 1853 by the Emperor of Russia for 1,000 guineas ($5,145). Lessore's unique artistic expression did not fit well with the techniques of the other artists in S√®vres and by 1858 Lessore had moved to England to work for English potter Thomas Minton. Lessore then moved to Etruria, Staffordshire, where he worked for the famous firm of Wedgwood. Lessore exhibits were well received and he received personal exhibition medals in London (1862), Paris (1867), and Vienna (1873).
