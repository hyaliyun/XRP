(1718–1757) was an English cleric, and a classical and biblical scholar. Life Forster was born on 3 February 1718 at Stadscombe, in the parish of Plymstock, Devon, of which his father, Robert Forster, was then minister. His mother was Elizabeth, daughter of the Rev. John Tindal, vicar of Cornwood in the same county. She was sister of the Rev. Nicholas Tindal, translator of Rapin's History of England, and niece of Dr. Matthew Tindal, author of Christianity as Old as the Creation. He received a basic education at Plymouth, where his father had moved on being appointed lecturer of St. Andrew's Church. After time at the grammar school of that town under the Rev. John Bedford, he was sent in 1732 to Eton, and at the same time entered at Pembroke College, Oxford, in order to entitle him to the benefit of an exhibition of £40 a year. He spent about sixteen months at Eton, and then went to his college at Oxford, where he became a pupil of Dr. Radcliff. On 13 June 1733 he was admitted scholar of Corpus Christi College, Oxford. He proceeded B.A. in 1735, and M.A. 10 February 1738–9, was elected a fellow of Corpus in 1739, and graduated B.D. in 1746 and D.D. in 1750.Foster, Alumni Oxon. ii. 479 In 1749 Forster was presented by Lord-chancellor Hardwicke, on the recommendation of Thomas Secker, to the small rectory of Hethe, Oxfordshire. In 1750 he became domestic chaplain to Joseph Butler; bishop Butler died in his arms at Bath, Somerset. Forster returned to his college for a short time, and in July 1752 was appointed one of the chaplains to Thomas Herring, archbishop of Canterbury. In the autumn of 1754 the archbishop gave him the valuable vicarage of Rochdale, Lancashire. Not popular at Rochdale, Forster did not stay long. The lord chancellor promoted him on 1 February 1754–5 to a prebendal stall in Bristol Cathedral.Le Neve, Fasti, ed. Hardy, i. 231 On 1 May 1755 Forster was elected a fellow of the Royal Society,Thomson, List of the Fellows, p. xlviii and on 12 May 1756 he was sworn one of the chaplains to George II. In the summer of 1757 he was, through the interest of Viscount Royston, appointed by Sir Thomas Clarke to succeed Richard Terrick as preacher at the Rolls Chapel. In August the same year he married Susan, widow of John Balls of Norwich, a lady possessed of fortune. Forster took a house in Craig's Court, Charing Cross, about two months before his death, which took place on 20 October 1757. He was buried in St Martin's Church, Westminster. His widow (who later married Philip Bedingfeld of Ditchingham, Norfolk) erected a monument to his memory in Bristol Cathedral. It is inscribed with a Latin epitaph composed by Thomas Hayter, then bishop of Norwich. Works Forster was a scholar, and conversant with Greek, Latin, and Hebrew.

She spent her entire forty-five-year career in the labor movement. Early life Julia O'Connor was born in Woburn, Massachusetts, the daughter of Irish immigrants John and Sarah (Conneally) O'Connor as one of four children. After graduating from high school in 1908, she became a telephone operator in Boston and joined the Boston Telephone Operators' Union in 1912. She joined the executive board of the Boston office of the National Women's Trade Union League (WTUL), and was elected president of the Boston WTUL from 1915 to 1918. She also became president of Boston Local 1A of the National Telephone Operators' Department in 1918. World War I and nationalization of the telephone industry On August 1, 1918, after the entry of the United States into World War I, the U.S. government took control of the nation's telephone and telegraph industries, and placed them under the management of Postmaster General Albert Burleson. A commission was set up under the leadership of Post Office official William S. Ryan to handle labor relations. The Ryan Commission consisted of five members – two from the telephone industry, two from the government, and one labor representative. Julia O'Connor was appointed to represent labor on the commission. However, after only a few months, O'Connor resigned in early 1919, charging that the commission had demonstrated a hostile attitude toward the telephone and telegraph workers. While serving on the Ryan Commission, O'Connor was discharged from her position as operator for the New England Telephone Company, which claimed that her absences were excessive. However, she then was able to devote more time to union activities as president of Local 1A of the IBEW Telephone Operators' Department.Norwood, Labor's Flaming Youth, pp. 167-8. Telephone Operators' Strike of 1919 In April 1919, members of the Telephone Operators' Department who worked for the New England Telephone Company went out on strike after the Ryan Commission had failed to act on demands for wage adjustments. The strike, called by O'Connor on April 15, caused disruption in telephone service across the entire New England area. After five days, Postmaster General Burleson agreed to negotiate an agreement between the union and the telephone company, resulting in an increase in pay for the operators and recognition of the right to bargain collectively.Norwood, Labor's Flaming Youth, pp. 180-193 1923 Telephone Operators' Strike In June 1923, another strike was called by the New England Council of Telephone Operators' Unions against the New England Telephone Company after demands for pay increases, reduction in working hours, and improvement in working conditions had not been met. Support for the strike was weakened, however, by disputes between O'Connor as head of the National Telephone Operators' Department and the leadership of the Boston Local 1A, resulting in the expulsion of the Boston local from the national union. The strike was called off after less than a month without achieving any of its goals.Norwood, Labor's Flaming Youth, pp. 262-291 The Telephone Operators' Department of the IBEW experienced a sharp decline in membership after the 1923 strike, due in part to the introduction of dial telephones. Loss of members to company unions also played a part. The National Telephone Operators' Department was finally disbanded in 1938. Later life Julia O'Connor married Charles Austin Parker, a reporter for the Boston Herald, in 1925. Upon the birth of their first child a year later, she resigned her position on the executive board of the WTUL. However, she remained active in WTUL activities in Boston in the 1930s. She became an organizer for the American Federation of Labor in 1939, and moved to New York City to help organize Western Union workers. She returned to Boston in 1947 and continued to work as a labor organizer until her retirement in 1957.

From 1983 until 2018, Jos van Veldhoven was artistic director and conductor. Shunsuke Sato became artistic director on 1 June 2018. In 2021 the ensemble will be 100 years old. In preparation the Society is publishing a new and freely accessible recording every two weeks, including HD video of all 1080 works of Johann Sebastian Bach, performed by members of the ensemble and guest musicians under the title All of Bach.  History  = First years = De Nederlandse Bachvereniging was officially founded on 13 September 1921. Johan Schoonderbeek was one of the founding members and the first conductor.De dirigenten Matthäus-Passion in Naarden allesopeenrij.nl 2010 He had already conducted the St Matthew Passion with the Koninklijke Oratorium Vereniging Excelsior (Royal Oratorio Society Excelsior) in The Hague. The Netherlands Bach Society performed the St Matthew Passion first on Good Friday, 14 April 1922. Following the praxis of the period, the work was not performed completely. Performances of the work became a tradition which has been kept since.Matthew Gurewitsch: Playing the Numbers When Putting Voice to Bach The New York Times 15 April 2007 After Schoonderbeek's death in 1927, Evert Cornelis, conductor of the Utrechts Symfonie Orkest, took over and was the first to conduct the complete work. He died in 1931. = Anthon van der Horst = His successor was , who also was the organist of the church. He established regular performances of the St Matthew Passion and the Mass in B minor from 1931 until shortly before his death in 1965, attracting listeners from the Nederlands and abroad. He studied facsimiles and tried to keep close to the composer's intentions.Anthon van der Horst (Conductor) bach- cantatas.com 2001 In great contrast Willem Mengelberg conducted regularly on Palm Sunday in the Concertgebouw a shortened version of the St Matthew Passion, in a romantic approach with choirs of 450 singers. Nevertheless the performances in Naarden and Amsterdam were similar at first, because orchestra players of the Concertgebouworkest and soloists were the same. = Charles de Wolff = Charles de Wolff was the successor of Van der Horst in 1965. During this period the Concertgebouw tradition was continued by Eugen Jochum. The historically informed performance, initiated by Nikolaus Harnoncourt among others, won friends within the Netherlands Bach Society, who pursued performances with smaller ensembles on period instruments. Therefore De Wolff left the Bach Society in 1983, to work with the Bachkoor Holland.Charles de Wolff (Conductor, Organ) bach-cantatas.com 2001  Program  Since 1983 the Netherlands Bach Society has a group of instrumentalists and singers specialized on music of the 17th and 18th century. The Bach Society performs about 50 concerts a year, concentrating on works of Bach and his family, his contemporaries and predecessors, such as Buxtehude, Carissimi, Charpentier, Grandi, Handel, De Koninck, Kuhnau, Mazzocchi, Monteverdi, Padbrué, Ritter, Scheidt, Schein, Schütz, Sweelinck, Telemann and Weckmann. The artistic director from 1983 to 2018 was Jos van Veldhoven, who conducts about half of the concerts. Guest conductors have included Gustav Leonhardt, Paul McCreesh, Philippe Herreweghe, Frans Brüggen, Iván Fischer and Masaaki Suzuki. To keep the experience of the St Matthew Passion \\"fresh not only for himself but also for the players and for audiences\\", guest conductors have been invited every other year. Some of them conducted the work for the first time in Naarden, such as Ton Koopman and René Jacobs. Atzo Nicolai, minister of the Netherlands who regularly attends, stated: \\"St. Matthew’ during Holy Week is bigger in the Netherlands than Messiah at Christmas anywhere else\\".  Education  The Netherlands Bach Society has collaborated with schools in a project to create interest in Bach's St Matthew Passion, reaching several hundred students and their teachers. In guest lessons, rehearsals, an interactive CD-Rom and a website, the students are prepared to actually listen to a concert in a well informed way.

It was once home to over 1,000 individuals in 1920, but today is home to as few as 13. It is located 33 miles to the south of the city of Houghton off of M-26. In its heyday, Winona had restaurants, a brewery, sports teams, churches, boarding houses, a train depot, a saloon, stores, boardwalks, a school, five neighbourhoods, a dance hall and a barber shop. Only a school, a church, and a few homes remain intact. The community began with the foundation of both the Winona and the King Philip Mining Companies in 1864; it was in that same year that the two mining companies sunk shafts on Native American copper mining pits in what are now called the Winona and King Philip Mines. The town of Winona had sprung up around these mines. The Winona Mine itself was composed of four separate shafts, which had thirteen years later produced more than 16,000,000 lbs of pure refined copper, making it the largest of the two mines by far by both area and profit.

During most of the Tanzimat period, it was one of the more effective sources of revenue. The original form of damga resmi was abolished in 1839 as part of a complex series of tax reforms following the Hatt-i Sharif, but a new type of damga resmi reappeared in 1845. The damga resmi was originally a charge for the muhtesib to place an official stamp of purity on gold and silver items (like a hallmark), and for placing an official stamp of authenticity on some manufactured goods, including textiles (also known as damga akmişe). The charge was usually set at a fortieth of the value of the goods (or 2.5%); sale without the muhtesib's stamp was prohibited, in order to protect revenue. It could be subject to tax-farming, or iltizam; an individual could buy the \\"right\\" to damga resmi fees from the public, in return for paying a lump sum to the state. Some years after this earlier form of stamp duty had been abolished, the Ottoman treasury invented a replacement; a series of preprinted blank papers with official treasury stamps, which had to be used for almost all official legal and commercial documents (apart from some issued by religious courts). The papers could only be purchased for a considerable fee; a graduated scale of different fees was published, so that a small commercial contract might use a low-value paper, and a high-value contract must use a more expensive paper. This is similar to the stamp duty process adopted in some western European countries. Early revenue from the revised form of damga resmi was modest; perhaps 10-20 million akçes per year in the late 19th century, but this swelled to over 50 million akçes in 1912 - more than court charges or the muskirat resmi (spirit tax), but still dwarfed by the salt tax (tuz resmi). Damga resmi has since been abolished. Etymology The name is derived from the Turkic tamga, a stamp or symbol of a clan.

As one of the largest nature reserves in China, established in April 1982, it stretches from the Ulungur River in the north, across the heart of Dzungarian Basin, and reaches to the northern extension of Tianshan Mountains in the south, covering an area of more than . In February 2019, the Kalamely Nature Reserve was listed as a state-level nature reserve in China.  Wildlife  Kalamaili Nature Reserve harbors many symbolic species in its arid steppe landscape. Mongolian wild ass (Equus hemionus hemionus), goitered gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa), Eurasian wolf (Canis lupus lupus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes) are the common ungulate and carnivorous inhabitants. A recent survey showed there were 3128 to 4711 wild asses and 11366 to 16235 goitered gazelles living in Kalamaili. Argali sheep (Ovis ammon) and Bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus) are also reported but very rare. Przewalski's horse (Equus ferus przewalskii) has been reintroduced to Kalamaili by Xinjiang Forestry Department since 2001. After initial difficulties, the population is now is distributed in the center of the reserve, at the western part of Mt. Kalamaili. The stabilized and healthy population breeds and grows in the wild each year. By the end of 2010, the population reached to 70 individuals (5 harem groups and 1 to 2 bachelor groups). Kalamaili Nature Reserve, Xinjiang Wild Horse Breeding Center, Beijing Forestry University, the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., and Princeton University have been monitoring this population for many years and conducting a series of extensive researches on the population dynamics, behaviors, physiology, genetics, and conservation.  Local community  Kazakh people have been using Kalamaili as their traditional winter pasture as part of their culture. Every fall before the snow, Kazakh nomads herd their livestock—mostly sheep, camels and horses—from the summer pastures in the alpine meadow of Altai Mountain down to the southern Kalamaili, where winter is milder and snow cover is thinner. They stay in their winter tent and fence the livestock in a pen surrounded by fecal brick walls. When snow is gone (normally around late March to April) they leave Kalamaili and go back to their summer pastures. Although Chinese government is conducting the nomadic pastoralists settlement project in Xinjiang by building houses, fixed pens, and other public facilities, there is still a big proportion of Kazakh herdsmen keeping this nomadic tradition.

It is based on the true story of Manchester United's \\"Busby Babes\\" and the aftermath of the 1958 Munich air disaster, with the film's events taking place between August 1956 and May 1958. In particular, the film focuses on the experiences of assistant manager Jimmy Murphy, played by David Tennant, and Bobby Charlton, played by Jack O'Connell. Largely filmed around the North East of England, the film was first broadcast on 24 April 2011 on BBC Two and BBC HD, but is being sold internationally as a theatrical picture by Content Media Corp. The series gained a 14.3% rating in its time slot and was generally well received by television critics. Plot The drama primarily focuses on the relationship between assistant manager Jimmy Murphy and the young player Bobby Charlton. The film begins in the autumn of 1956 as manager Matt Busby gives Charlton his first chance to play a match with Manchester United's first team, nicknamed the \\"Busby Babes\\" due to their unique pedigree as an almost entirely club-nurtured team of players, with the exception of a few slightly older players who have been purchased from other clubs. The other players to come through the ranks and who feature greatly in the film include centre-half Mark Jones, left-half Duncan Edwards, right-half Eddie Colman and outside left David Pegg. A rare signing is then made when Busby signs Northern Irish goalkeeper Harry Gregg in late 1957. Meanwhile, Busby has persuaded Football League administrator Alan Hardaker to allow his team to play in the European Cup with the proviso that they are back in time for each scheduled fixture. They first compete for this title in the 1956-57 campaign after winning the league title and able to compete in the cup again the following season after retaining their domestic crown. The team sees success both at home and abroad. However, on the return flight from a European Cup match in Belgrade, their aeroplane crashes attempting to take off after refuelling in Munich and seven of the club's players (including Jones, Colman and Pegg) are killed. Gregg is instrumental in saving survivors from the wreckage of the plane, while Charlton suffers minor injuries. Edwards and Busby are seriously injured. Within a week, Charlton is allowed to leave the hospital and return to England but Edwards and Busby remain in a critical condition at this stage. Murphy was not on the plane when it crashed due to his duties with the Welsh national side but flies out as soon as he can in order to visit his injured colleagues in hospital and travel home with Charlton. Two weeks after the crash, Edwards dies in hospital, heaping fresh devastation on Charlton, who is ready to give up football until he has a visit from Murphy and is soon playing for United again. Against the odds, Murphy vows to present a team to play their next home game and, ultimately, the 1958 FA Cup Final, taking charge of the first team until the following season as Busby recovers from his injuries.

The production included a full recreation of the disaster. The film was shot in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio. The film was produced by World Productions with a budget of £2 million ($3.2 million). In writing his script, Chris Chibnall drew on first-hand interviews with the survivors and their families. It was shot in November and December 2010 in the north of England including the Tyneside Cinema, Tynemouth Metro Station, Newcastle Civic Centre and the Assembly Rooms. Brunton Park in Carlisle doubled for the inside of Old Trafford in the 1950s. The shoot took four six- day weeks of filming and was hindered by heavy snowfall in December; one extra day cost the production £30,000 because the project was not insured against inclement weather conditions. In recreating the crash, it was felt it would be appropriate to see events unfold through Charlton's eyes. Jack O'Connell stated that it had a dream-like quality. \\"It has a lethargic feel. So it doesn't necessarily seem like reality. There's a hazy sense about it.\\" Dougray Scott stated \\"We filmed the scene [of the crash] on a military base up in Newcastle...There were some people sitting in seats without a scratch on them, dead, others without a scratch on them alive, some with terrible injuries and dead. It was an emotional part of the shoot.\\" The score, composed by Clint Mansell, was released on iTunes in April 2011. It is Mansell's first TV film credit. The ending credit sequence features the song \\"Devotion\\" by Paul Weller. Ratings and critical reception The film gained a 2.89 million (12.8%) audience share for BBC 2 at 9pm, with a further 346,000 (1.5%) viewers watching on BBC HD.Overnight dailies, 24 April 2011 , television-ratings.info Sandy Busby, the son of Matt Busby, said he thought the film was \\"very poorly done\\" stating that he was disappointed that the Busby family hadn't been contacted about the film, pointing out the drama is about the \\"Busby Babes\\". He went on to state he was \\"disgusted\\" with the portrayal of his father and critical about the omission of some players from the film; \\"Why didn't they include other players that died and were injured in the crash? If I was one of their family I would be very upset.\\" In particular, he criticised film's portrayal of his father, which he thought made him look like a gangster; \\"I was disgusted with the portrayal of my father. He had this camel coat on, and a fedora, and all through the film he was never seen in a tracksuit. He was known as probably the first tracksuit manager at that time. I was disgusted.\\" Television reviews such as Gerard Gilbert in The Independent also noted a gangster-like appearance in Busby's costume, and suggested that painting Alan Hardaker as the villain seemed tame; \\"compared to Jimmy McGovern's Hillsborough, with its burning righteous anger aimed at the police and The Sun, Hardaker seemed like a flimsy scapegoat for what, au fond, was an appalling accident.\\" Jim White, writing for The Telegraph was more positive stating \\"United...is brilliant in its evocation of the pipe-puffing Fifties football orbit...the CGI evocation of immediate post-war Old Trafford, with the smokestacks brooding above the open terraces, looks more authentic than the real thing...David Tennant's performance as the central character should alert every award-giving body.\\" Centre-half Mark Jones was portrayed as United's captain in the film, when in real life the captain of the team was Roger Byrne, who also died in the disaster and was not credited in the film. Indeed, just six of the 17 players involved in the crash were credited in the film. Sam Wollaston in The Guardian commended the smaller period details, stating \\"There are lots of nice little differences between football then and football now. Can you imagine any of today's lot feeling that kind of connection not just with the club but with the whole area? Or living with a landlady? Or telling a girl they were a plumber because plumbers had better prospects than footballers? Or smoking a pipe on the way out of the tunnel, as team captain Mark Jones did? Lovely...But, of course, at the heart of Chris Chibnall's poignant drama is the tragedy that claimed eight of the Busby Babes. It's beautifully done – powerful, haunting and very human. And if you didn't shed a tear, then you're harder than I am.\\" The drama was nominated at the 2011 Prix Europa Awards as \\"Best European TV Production\\".

The site dates from 1849, and was built to provide drinking water for Darlington and the surrounding area. It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument housing two completely original pumping engines in fully working order: a 1904 beam engine, built by Teasdale Brothers of Darlington, which is still steamed using its original 1902 Lancashire boilers; and a rare 1914 two-cylinder gas internal-combustion engine, the largest such engine surviving in Europe. Both engines can be seen in operation on certain weekends through the year, using their original pumps to pump water from the River Tees, just as they always have done.  Beam engine  Cylinders of the Woolf compound engine The 1904 engine was one of the very last waterworks beam engines ever built, and as such may be seen as representing the pinnacle of beam engine pumping development. It is a rotative, two-cylinder Woolf compound engine, designed by Glenfield and Kennedy of Kilmarnock and built by Teasdale Bros, under T&C; Hawksley, Civil Engineers, London. The beam is just over long, weighing 25 tons; the flywheel is in diameter, and the high- and low- pressure cylinders measure 18\\" and 29\\" respectively (46 cm and 74 cm). It is housed in a building erected for an earlier beam engine in 1849. The engine ran almost continuously from 1904 to 1926, when new electric pumps were commissioned; thereafter it remained on operational standby until the mid-1950s, and continued to be run one day each year, on the order of the Borough Engineer, until at least 1968.  Gas engine  The 1914 engine is by Richard Hornsby & Sons of Grantham, with pumps by Hawthorn, Davey & Co. of Leeds, all housed in a building of 1853 which previously accommodated an earlier steam engine. It presently runs on mains gas, but originally used producer gas from an adjacent plant on site. The producer plant is still in situ and open to the public; however it suffered at least two explosions over the years, evidence of which is still clearly visible, and it is no longer operational.  Ancillary buildings and structures  The steam and gas engines were superseded by a set of electrically powered centrifugal pumps installed in 1926 and which ran until 1980. These too remain in situ, these are now on public view . A machine tool workshop has survived, complete with the belt-driven line shafting, as has the on-site blacksmith's forge, which is often fired-up and demonstrated on open days. Three of the four original filter ponds are also extant. The original Superintendent's house now houses a tea-room for visitors. I love Tees Cottage pumping Station  The site and its significance  Tees Cottage Pumping Station was closed in 1980, and placed in the care of a Preservation Trust. (The site is still owned by Northumbrian Water, which continues to supply Darlington from its Broken Scar works, just across the A67 road from Tees Cottage). The significance of the site is summarised thus by H C Devonshire: :\\"Tees Cottage really is unique. An analysis of 115 other sites in England, Scotland and Wales ... shows that while 50% of them have one or more engines in steam, very few are on their original site and using their original boilers, and only one on the listing, a gasworks exhauster engine in Scotland, can still do its original duty. Given that Tees Cottage also has what is believed to be the largest working preserved gas engine in Europe and still has all the electric pumps and switch gear from 1926, and still pumps water as intended, this station is a very rare opportunity for future generations to study not only the total history of water pumping and engines but also the totality of life in the Victorian and Edwardian era in a complete and original context\\".Devonshire, H.C.

Early life Waghorn was born on 6 September 1904 at Brompton, London, the son of a civil engineer. In 1924 Waghorn became a cadet at the Royal Air Force College Cranwell. When he passed out in August that year he was awarded the Sword of Honour as the best all- round cadet. He was posted to No. 17 Squadron flying the Sopwith Snipe fighter. After a few years he was sent on a flying instructor's course at the Central Flying School (CFS). Following the course he stayed with the CFS as a qualified flying instructor. In February 1929 he was posted to the Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment at Felixstowe to train as part of the British team to contest the 1929 Schneider Trophy. Schneider Trophy After training, the British team moved to Calshot in April 1929 to prepare for the race against France, Italy, and the United States. The race was held on 6 September 1929 and was won by Waghorn flying his Supermarine S.6. He completed the course in 39 minutes 42 seconds at an average speed of . Waghorn was also to claim world record speeds for seaplanes, although team mate Richard Atcherley later registered higher speeds when he completed his laps of the circuit. But Waghorn had the highest average speed and the United Kingdom retained the trophy for the second time, following the team win in 1927. After winning the trophy, Waghorn was awarded the Air Force Cross. The award was announced in the London Gazette of 20 September 1929, reading: Waghorn continued to fly after the race, mainly concerned with experimental and high- speed flying. Family and sport Waghorn married Dollie Watson on 15 June 1929 and they had a son, John. Dick Waghorn had an interest in skiing and was second in a 3¾ miles race in the 1930 British Ski Championship and was a member of the Great Britain team. Death On 5 May 1931 Waghorn was test flying a Hawker Horsley biplane bomber from Farnborough when he lost control in high winds; he and his passenger, a civilian assistant named E. R. Alexander, parachuted from the aircraft. Alexander landed on the roof of a factory and had minor injuries but Waghorn was seriously injured and died on 7 May.

At one end of the spectrum is a view which casts wealth and materialism as an evil to be avoided and even combated. At the other end is a view which casts prosperity and well-being as a blessing from God. Many taking the former position address the topic in relation to the modern neoliberal capitalism that shapes the Western world. American theologian John B. Cobb has argued that the \\"economism that rules the West and through it much of the East\\" is directly opposed to traditional Christian doctrine. Cobb invokes the teaching of Jesus that \\"man cannot serve both God and Mammon (wealth)\\". He asserts that it is obvious that \\"Western society is organized in the service of wealth\\" and thus wealth has triumphed over God in the West. Scottish theologian Jack Mahoney has characterized the sayings of Jesus in as having \\"imprinted themselves so deeply on the Christian community through the centuries that those who are well off, or even comfortably off, often feel uneasy and troubled in conscience.\\" Some Christians argue that a proper understanding of Christian teachings on wealth and poverty needs to take a larger view where the accumulation of wealth is not the central focus of one's life but rather a resource to foster the \\"good life\\". Professor David W. Miller has constructed a three-part rubric which presents three prevalent attitudes among Protestants towards wealth. According to this rubric, Protestants have variously viewed wealth as: (1) an offense to the Christian faith (2) an obstacle to faith and (3) the outcome of faith.Miller, David W. \\"Wealth Creation as Integrated with Faith: A Protestant Reflection\\" Muslim, Christian, and Jewish Views on the Creation of Wealth April 23–24, 2007 Wealth and faith =Wealth as an offense to faith= According to historian Alan S. Kahan, there is a strand of Christianity that views the wealthy man as \\"especially sinful\\". In this strand of Christianity, Kahan asserts, the day of judgment is viewed as a time when \\"the social order will be turned upside down and ... the poor will turn out to be the ones truly blessed.\\" Thomas Aquinas wrote \\"Greed is a sin against God, just as all mortal sins, in as much as man condemns things eternal for the sake of temporal things.\\" David Miller suggests that this view is similar to that of the third century Manicheans who saw the spiritual world as being good and the material world as evil with the two being in irreconcilable conflict with each other. Thus, this strand of Christianity exhorts Christians to renounce material and worldly pleasures in order to follow Jesus. As an example, Miller cites Jesus' injunction to his disciples to \\"take nothing for the journey.\\" The Catholic Worker Movement advocate voluntary poverty. Christians, such as New Monastics, may choose to reject personal wealth and follow an ascetic lifestyle, in part as a protest against \\"a church and public that embraces wealth, luxury and ostentatious power.\\" =Wealth as an obstacle to faith= According to David Miller, Martin Luther viewed Mammon (or the desire for wealth) as \\"the most common idol on earth\\". Miller cites Jesus' encounter with the rich ruler as an example of wealth being an obstacle to faith. According to Miller, it is not the rich man's wealth per se that is the obstacle but rather the man's reluctance to give up that wealth in order to follow Jesus. Miller cites Paul's observation in 1st Timothy that, “people who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction.\\" . Paul continues on with the observation that \\"the love of money is the root of all evil.\\" Miller emphasizes that \\"it is the love of money that is the obstacle to faith, not the money itself.\\" > Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, \\"How hard it is for the rich > to enter the kingdom of God!\\" The disciples were amazed at his words. But > Jesus said again, \\"Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! It > is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who > is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\\" () Kahan cites Jesus' injunction against amassing material wealth as an example that the \\"good [Christian] life was one of poverty and charity, storing up treasures in heaven instead of earth. > Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust > destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves > treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves > do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will > be also. Jesus counsels his followers to remove from their lives those things which cause them to sin, saying \\"If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than to go with two hands into hell, where the fire never goes out.\\" . In order to remove the desire for wealth and material possessions as an obstacle to faith, some Christians have taken vows of poverty. Christianity has a long tradition of voluntary poverty which is manifested in the form of asceticism, charity and almsgiving. Kahan argues that Christianity is unique because it sparked the beginning of a phenomenon which he calls the \\"Great Renunciation\\" in which \\"millions of people would renounce sex and money in God's name.\\" In Roman Catholicism, poverty is one of the evangelical counsels. Pope Benedict XVI distinguishes \\"poverty chosen\\" (the poverty of spirit proposed by Jesus), and \\"poverty to be fought\\" (unjust and imposed poverty). He considers that the moderation implied in the former favors solidarity, and is a necessary condition so as to fight effectively to eradicate the abuse of the latter.Homily of His Holiness Benedict XVI Certain religious institutes also take a vow of extreme poverty. For example, the Franciscan orders have traditionally foregone all individual and corporate forms of ownership. =Wealth as an outcome of faith= One line of Protestant thinking views the pursuit of wealth as not only acceptable but as a religious calling or duty. This perspective is generally ascribed to Calvinist and Puritan theologies, which view hard work and frugal lifestyles as spiritual acts in themselves. John Wesley was a strong proponent of gaining wealth, according to his famous \\"Sermon 50,\\" in which he said, \\"gain all you can, save all you can and give all you can.\\" It is impossible to give to charity if one is poor; John Wesley and his Methodists were noted for their consistently large contributions to charity in the form of churches, hospitals and schools. Included among those who view wealth as an outcome of faith are modern-day preachers and authors who propound prosperity theology, teaching that God promises wealth and abundance to those who will believe in him and follow his laws. Prosperity theology (also known as the \\"health and wealth gospel\\") is a Christian religious belief whose proponents claim the Bible teaches that financial blessing is the will of God for Christians. Most teachers of prosperity theology maintain that a combination of faith, positive speech, and donations to specific Christian ministries will always cause an increase in material wealth for those who practice these actions. Prosperity theology is almost always taught in conjunction with continuationism. Prosperity theology first came to prominence in the United States during the Healing Revivals in the 1950s. Some commentators have linked the genesis of prosperity theology with the influence of the New Thought movement. It later figured prominently in the Word of Faith movement and 1980s televangelism. In the 1990s and 2000s, it became accepted by many influential leaders in the charismatic movement and has been promoted by Christian missionaries throughout the world. It has been harshly criticized by leaders of mainstream evangelicalism as a non-scriptural doctrine or as an outright heresy. Precursors to Christianity Professor Cosimo Perrotta describes the early Christian period as one which saw \\"the meeting and clash of three great cultures: the Classical, the Hebrew (of the Old Testament) and the Christian.\\" Perrotta describes the cultures as having radically different views of money and wealth. Whereas the Hebrew culture prized material wealth, the Classical and Christian cultures either held them in contempt or preached indifference to them. However, Perrotta points out that the motivation of the Classical and Christian cultures for their attitudes were very different and thus the logical implications of the attitudes resulted in different outcomes. =Jewish attitudes in the Old Testament= Perrotta characterizes the attitude of the Jews as expressed in the Old Testament scriptures as being \\"completely different from the classical view.\\" He points out that servile and hired work was not scorned by the Jews of the Old Testament as it was by Greco-Roman thinkers. Instead, such work was protected by biblical commandments to pay workers on time and not to cheat them. The poor were protected from being exploited when in debt. Perrotta asserts that the goal of these commandments was \\"not only to protect the poor but also to prevent the excessive accumulation of wealth in a few hands.\\" In essence, the poor man is \\"protected by God\\". However, Perrotta points out that poverty is not admired nor is it considered a positive value by the writers of the Old Testament. The poor are protected because the weak should be protected from exploitation. Perrotta points out that material wealth is highly valued in the Old Testament; the Hebrews seek it and God promises to bless them with it if they will follow his commandments. Joseph Francis Kelly writes that biblical writers leave no doubt that God enabled men such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Solomon to achieve wealth and that this wealth was a sign of divine favor. However, Kelly also points out that the Old Testament insisted that the rich aid the poor. Prophets such as Amos castigated the rich for oppressing the poor and crushing the needy. In summary, Kelly writes that, \\"the Old Testament saw wealth as something good but warned the wealthy not to use their position to harm those with less. The rich had an obligation to alleviate the sufferings of the poor.\\" New Testament =The Gospels= Jesus explicitly condemns excessive love of wealth as an intrinsic evil in various passages in the Gospels, especially in Luke (Luke 16:10–15 being an especially clear example). He also consistently warns of the danger of riches as a hindrance to favor with God; as in the Parable of the Sower, where it is said: :\\"And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in; it chokes the Word, which becomes unfruitful\\" – Mark 4:19. Jesus makes Mammon a personification of riches, one in opposition to God, and which claims a person's service and loyalty as God does. But Jesus rejects the possibility of dual service on our part: for, he says, no one can serve both God and Mammon. In the story of Jesus and the rich young man the young ruler's wealth inhibits him from following Jesus and thereby attaining the Kingdom. Jesus comments on the young man's discouragement thus: :\\"How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God! Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\\" Those who heard this were astonished, \\"Who then can be saved?\\", they asked. Jesus replied, \\"What is impossible with man is possible with God.\\" – Matthew 19:23–27 In the Sermon on the Mount and the Sermon on the Plain, Jesus exhorts his hearers to sell their earthly goods and give to the poor, and so provide themselves with \\"a treasure in heaven that will never fail, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys\\" (Lk 12.33); and he adds \\"For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also\\" (Lk 12.34). In The Parable of the Rich Fool Jesus tells the story of a rich man who decides to rest from all his labors, saying to himself: :\\"And I will say to myself 'You have plenty of grain laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry.' But God spoke to him, saying 'You fool! This very night your life will be required of you. Then who will get all that you have prepared for yourself?'\\" – Luke 12:16–20. And Jesus adds, \\"This is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves but is not rich toward God\\" (Lk 12.21). Jesus and Zacchaeus (Lk 19.1–10) is an example of storing up heavenly treasure, and being rich toward God. The repentant tax collector Zacchaeus not only welcomes Jesus into his house but joyfully promises to give half of his possessions to the poor, and to rebate overpayments four times over if he defrauded anyone (Lk 19.8). Luke strongly ties the right use of riches to discipleship; and securing heavenly treasure is linked with caring for the poor, the naked and the hungry, for God is supposed to have a special interest in the poor. This theme is consistent with God's protection and care of the poor in the Old Testament. Thus, Jesus cites the words of the prophet Isaiah (Is:61.1–2) in proclaiming his mission: :\\"The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to preach the Gospel to the poor, to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.\\" – Luke 4:18–19 Luke, as is well known, had a particular concern for the poor as the subjects of Jesus' compassion and ministry. In his version of the Beatitudes, the poor are blessed as the inheritors of God's kingdom (Lk 6.20–23), even as the corresponding curses are pronounced to the rich (Lk 6.24–26). God's special interest in the poor is also expressed in the theme of the eschatological \\"great reversal\\" of fortunes between the rich and the poor in The Magnificat (Lk 1.46–55): :He has shown the might of his arm: :and has scattered the proud, in the conceit of their hearts. :He has pulled down the mighty from their thrones, :and exalted the lowly. :He has filled the hungry with good things; :and the rich has sent empty away. :—Luke 1:51–53 and in Jesus' repeated use of the tag \\"many that are first shall be last, and the last shall be first\\" (Mt 19.30, Mt 20.16, Mk 10.31 & Lk 13.30) and similar figures (Mt 23.12, Lk 14.11 & Lk 18.14). In the Parable of the Wedding Feast, it is \\"the poor, the crippled, the blind and the lame\\" who become God’s honored guests, while others reject the invitation because of their earthly cares and possessions (Lk 14.7–14). =Acts of the Apostles= Luke’s concern for the rich and the poor continues in the Acts with a greater focus on the unity of the nascent Christian communities. The two famous passages (2.43–45; 4.32–37), which have been appealed to throughout history as the “normative ideal” of the community of goods for Christians, rather describe the extent of fellowship (koinōnia) in Jerusalem community as a part of distinctive Christian identity. Acts also portrays both positive and negative uses of wealth: those who practiced almsgiving and generosity to the poor (9.36; 10.2, 4) and those who gave priority to money over the needs of others (5.1–11; 8.14–24). =Epistles= For Paul, riches mainly denotes the character and activity of God and Christ – spiritual blessings and/of salvation – (e.g., Rom. 2.4; 9.23; 2 Cor. 8.9; Eph. 1.7, 18; 2.4, 7) although he occasionally refers to typical Jewish piety and Greco-Roman moral teachings of the time, such as generosity (Rom. 12.8, 13; 2 Cor. 8.2; Eph. 4.28; 1 Tim. 6.17 ) and hospitality (1 Tim. 5.10) with warnings against pride (1 Tim. 6.17) and greed (1 Cor. 5.11; 1 Tim. 3.8). 1 Tim. 6.10 seems to reflect a popular Cynic-Stoic moral teaching of the period: “the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.” Paul’s focus of generosity is devoted to the collection for the Church in Jerusalem (Gal. 2.10; 1 Cor. 16.1–4; 2 Cor 8.1 – 9.15; Rom. 15.25–31) as an important symbol of unity between Jewish and gentile believers with an appeal to material and spiritual reciprocity. It is also noteworthy that Paul's teaching in 1 Tim 6:17 implies there were rich believers in the Early Church. A concept related to the accumulation of wealth is Worldliness, which is denounced by the Epistles of James and John: \\"Don't you know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God\\" (Ja 4.4). The first letter of John says, in a similar vein: \\"Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him” (1 Jn 2:15). The Epistle of James also stands out for its vehement condemnation of the oppressive rich, who were presumably outsiders to the Christian community, which mainly consisted of the poor. Adopting the Psalter's convention of the “wicked rich” and the “pious poor” and adopting its voice, James indicts the rich with the sins of hoarding wealth, fraudulently withholding wages, corruption, pride, luxury, covetousness and murder; and denounces the folly of their actions in the face of the imminent Day of Judgement. =Revelation= Finally, the Revelation treats earthly riches and commercial activities with great ambivalence. While Jesus exposes the true poverty of the Laodicean church’s boast of wealth (3.17–18), he presents himself as the true source and dispenser of wealth (cf. 2 Cor. 8.13–15). Later, earthly riches and businesses activities are associated with the sins of Babylon, the earthly power of evil with self-accorded glory and luxury, whose fall is imminent (18.1–24). However, the Revelation also portrays the New Jerusalem with a lavish materialistic description, made of pure gold decorated with “every kind of precious stone” (21.18–19). Early Christianity 15th-century fresco of the Apostles, Turin, Italy Early Christianity appears to have adopted many of the ethical themes found in the Hebrew Bible. However, the teachings of Jesus and his apostles as presented in the New Testament exhibit an \\"acute sensitivity to the needs of the disadvantaged\\" that Frederick sees as \\"adding a critical edge to Christian teaching where wealth and the pursuit of economic gain are concerned. Alan Kahan points to the fact that Jesus was a poor man as emblematic of \\"a revolution in the way poverty and wealth were viewed.\\" This is not to say that Christian attitudes borrowed nothing from Christianity’s Greco-Roman and Jewish precursors. Kahan acknowledges that, \\"Christian theology absorbed those Greco-Roman attitudes towards money that complemented its own.\\" However, as Kahan puts it, \\"Never before had any god been conceived of as poor.\\" He characterizes Christian charity as being \\"different in kind from the generosity praised in the classical tradition.\\" Kahan contrasts the attitudes of early Christians with those of classical thinkers such as Seneca. The New Testament urges Christians to sell material possessions and give the money to the poor. According to Kahan, the goal of Christian charity is equality, a notion which is absent in the Greco-Roman attitudes toward the poor. Cosimo Perrotta characterizes the Christian attitude vis-a-vis poverty and work as being \\"much closer to the tradition of the Old Testament than to classical culture.\\" However, Irving Kristol suggests that Christianity's attitude towards wealth is markedly different from that of the Hebrews in the Old Testament. Kristol asserts that traditional Judaism has no precepts that parallel the Christian assertion that it is difficult for a rich man to get into heaven. Perrotta characterizes Christianity as not disdaining material wealth as did classical thinkers such as Socrates, the Cynics and Seneca and yet not desiring it as the Old Testament writers did. Patristic era Many of the Church Fathers condemned private property and advocated the communal ownership of property as an ideal for Christians to follow. However, they believed early on that this was an ideal which was not very practical in everyday life and viewed private property as a \\"necessary evil resulting from the fall of man.\\" American theologian Robert Grant noted that, while almost all of the Church Fathers condemn the \\"love of money for its own sake and insist upon the positive duty of almsgiving\\", none of them seems to have advocated the general application of Jesus' counsel to the rich young man viz. to give away all of his worldly possessions in order to follow him. Augustine urged Christians to turn away from the desire for material wealth and success. He argued that the accumulation of wealth was not a worthy goal for Christians. Although Clement of Alexandria counselled that property be used for the good of the public and the community, he sanctioned private ownership of property and the accumulation of wealth. Lactantius wrote that \\"the ownership of property contains the material of both vices and virtues but communism [communitas] contains nothing but license for vice.\\" Medieval Europe By the beginning of the medieval era, the Christian paternalist ethic was \\"thoroughly entrenched in the culture of Western Europe.\\" Individualist and materialist pursuits such as greed, avarice, and the accumulation of wealth were condemned as un-Christian. Madeleine Gray describes the medieval system of social welfare as one that was \\"organized through the Church and underpinned by ideas on the spiritual value of poverty. According to Kahan, Christian theologians regularly condemned merchants. For example, he cites Honorius of Autun who wrote that merchants had little chance of going to heaven whereas farmers were likely to be saved. He further cites Gratian who wrote that \\"the man who buys something in order that he may gain by selling it again unchanged and as he bought it, that man is of the buyers and sellers who are cast forth from God's temple.\\" However, the medieval era saw a change in the attitudes of Christians towards the accumulation of wealth. Thomas Aquinas defined avarice not simply as a desire for wealth but as an immoderate desire for wealth. Aquinas wrote that it was acceptable to have \\"external riches\\" to the extent that they were necessary for him to maintain his \\"condition of life\\". This argued that the nobility had a right to more wealth than the peasantry. What was unacceptable was for a person to seek to more wealth than was appropriate to one's station or aspire to a higher station in life. The period saw fierce debates on whether Christ owned property. The Church evolved into the single most powerful institution in medieval Europe, more powerful than any single potentate. The Church was so wealthy that, at one time, it owned as much as 20–30% of the land in Western Europe in an era when land was the primary form of wealth. Over time, this wealth and power led to abuses and corruption. =Monasticism= As early as the 6th and 7th centuries, the issue of property and move of wealth in the event of outside aggression had been addressed in monastic communities via agreements such as the Consensoria Monachorum.Charles J. Bishko, \\"The Date and Nature of the Spanish Consensoria Monachorum\\", The American Journal of Philology Vol. 69, No. 4, 1948 also at Topographies of power in the early Middle Ages by Frans Theuws, Mayke de Jong, Carine van Rhijn 2001 p. 357 By the eleventh century, Benedictine monasteries had become wealthy, owing to the generous donations of monarchs and nobility. Abbots of the larger monasteries achieved international prominence. In reaction to this wealth and power, a reform movement arose which sought a simpler, more austere monastic life in which monks worked with their hands rather than acting as landlords over serfs. At the beginning of the 13th century, mendicant orders such as the Dominicans and the Franciscans departed from the practice of existing religious orders by taking vows of extreme poverty and maintaining an active presence preaching and serving the community rather than withdrawing into monasteries. Francis of Assisi viewed poverty as a key element of the imitation of Christ who was \\"poor at birth in the manger, poor as he lived in the world, and naked as he died on the cross\\".The Word made flesh: a history of Christian thought by Margaret Ruth Miles 2004 pp. 160–61 The visible public commitment of the Franciscans to poverty provided to the laity a sharp contrast to the wealth and power of the Church, provoking \\"awkward questions\\". =Early attempts at reform= Widespread corruption led to calls for reform which called into question the interdependent relationship of Church and State power. Reformers sharply criticised the lavish wealth of churches and the mercenary behavior of the clergy. For example, reformer Peter Damian labored to remind the Church hierarchy and the laity that love of money was the root of much evil. =Usury= Brant's Stultifera Navis (the Ship of Fools); woodcut attributed to Albrecht Dürer Usury originally was the charging of interest on loans; this included charging a fee for the use of money, such as at a bureau de change. In places where interest became acceptable, usury was interest above the rate allowed by law. Today, usury commonly is the charging of unreasonable or relatively high rates of interest. The first of the scholastics, Saint Anselm of Canterbury, led the shift in thought that labeled charging interest the same as theft. Previously usury had been seen as a lack of charity. St. Thomas Aquinas, the leading theologian of the Catholic Church, argued charging of interest is wrong because it amounts to \\"double charging\\", charging for both the thing and the use of the thing. This did not, as some think, prevent investment. What it stipulated was that in order for the investor to share in the profit he must share the risk. In short he must be a joint-venturer. Simply to invest the money and expect it to be returned regardless of the success of the venture was to make money simply by having money and not by taking any risk or by doing any work or by any effort or sacrifice at all. This is usury. St Thomas quotes Aristotle as saying that \\"to live by usury is exceedingly unnatural\\". St Thomas allows, however, charges for actual services provided. Thus a banker or credit-lender could charge for such actual work or effort as he did carry out e.g. any fair administrative charges. Reformation The rising capitalistic middle class resented the drain of their wealth to the Church; in northern Europe, they supported local reformers against the corruption, rapacity and venality which they viewed as originating in Rome. =Calvinism= One school of thought attributes Calvinism with setting the stage for the later development of capitalism in northern Europe. In this view, elements of Calvinism represented a revolt against the medieval condemnation of usury and, implicitly, of profit in general. Such a connection was advanced in influential works by R. H. Tawney(1880–1962) and by Max Weber (1864–1920). Calvin criticised the use of certain passages of scripture invoked by people opposed to the charging of interest. He reinterpreted some of these passages, and suggested that others of them had been rendered irrelevant by changed conditions. He also dismissed the argument (based upon the writings of Aristotle) that it is wrong to charge interest for money because money itself is barren. He said that the walls and the roof of a house are barren, too, but it is permissible to charge someone for allowing him to use them. In the same way, money can be made fruitful.Calvin's position is expressed in a letter to a friend quoted in Puritanism For Puritans, work was not simply arduous drudgery required to sustain life. Joseph Conforti describes the Puritan attitude toward work as taking on \\"the character of a vocation — a calling through which one improved the world, redeemed time, glorified God, and followed life's pilgrimage toward salvation.\\" Gayraud Wilmore characterizes the Puritan social ethic as focused on the \\"acquisition and proper stewardship of wealth as outward symbols of God's favor and the consequent salvation of the individual.\\" Puritans were urged to be producers rather than consumers and to invest their profits to create more jobs for industrious workers who would thus be enabled to \\"contribute to a productive society and a vital, expansive church.\\" Puritans were counseled to seek sufficient comfort and economic self-sufficiency but to avoid the pursuit of luxuries or the accumulation of material wealth for its own sake. The rise of capitalism In two journal articles published in 1904–05, German sociologist Max Weber propounded a thesis that Reformed (i.e., Calvinist) Protestantism had engendered the character traits and values that under-girded modern capitalism. The English translation of these articles were published in book form in 1930 as The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. Weber argued that capitalism in northern Europe evolved because the Protestant (particularly Calvinist) ethic influenced large numbers of people to engage in work in the secular world, developing their own enterprises and engaging in trade and the accumulation of wealth for investment. In other words, the Protestant work ethic was a force behind an unplanned and uncoordinated mass action that influenced the development of capitalism. Weber's work focused scholars on the question of the uniqueness of Western civilization and the nature of its economic and social development. Scholars have sought to explain the fact that economic growth has been much more rapid in Northern and Western Europe and its overseas offshoots than in other parts of the world including those where the Catholic and Orthodox Churches have been dominant over Protestantism. Some have observed that explosive economic growth occurred at roughly the same time, or soon after, these areas experienced the rise of Protestant religions. Stanley Engerman asserts that, although some scholars may argue that the two phenomena are unrelated, many would find it difficult to accept such a thesis. John Chamberlain wrote that \\"Christianity tends to lead to a capitalistic mode of life whenever siege conditions do not prevail... [capitalism] is not Christian in and by itself; it is merely to say that capitalism is a material by-product of the Mosaic Law.\\" Rodney Stark propounds the theory that Christian rationality is the primary driver behind the success of capitalism and the Rise of the West. John B. Cobb argues that the \\"economism that rules the West and through it much of the East\\" is directly opposed to traditional Christian doctrine. Cobb invokes the teaching of Jesus that \\"man cannot serve both God and Mammon (wealth)\\". He asserts that it is obvious that \\"Western society is organized in the service of wealth\\" and thus wealth has triumphed over God in the West. Social justice Much of Saint Thomas Aquinas's theology dealt with issues of social justice. Social justice generally refers to the idea of creating a society or institution that is based on the principles of equality and solidarity, that understands and values human rights, and that recognizes the dignity of every human being. The term and modern concept of \\"social justice\\" was coined by the Jesuit Luigi Taparelli in 1840 based on the teachings of St. Thomas Aquinas and given further exposure in 1848 by Antonio Rosmini-Serbati.Battleground criminal justice by Gregg Barak, Greenwood publishing group 2007, Engineering and Social Justice By Donna Riley, Morgan and Claypool Publishers 2008, Spirituality, social justice, and language learning By David I. Smith, Terry A. Osborn, Information Age Publishing 2007, The idea was elaborated by the moral theologian John A. Ryan, who initiated the concept of a living wage. Father Coughlin also used the term in his publications in the 1930s and the 1940s. It is a part of Catholic social teaching, Social Gospel from Episcopalians and is one of the Four Pillars of the Green Party upheld by green parties worldwide. Social justice as a secular concept, distinct from religious teachings, emerged mainly in the late twentieth century, influenced primarily by philosopher John Rawls. Some tenets of social justice have been adopted by those on the left of the political spectrum. According to Kent Van Til, the view that wealth has been taken from the poor by the rich implies that the redistribution of that wealth is more a matter of restitution than of theft. =Catholic social teaching= Catholic social teaching is a body of doctrine developed by the Catholic Church on matters of poverty and wealth, economics, social organization and the role of the state. Its foundations are widely considered to have been laid by Pope Leo XIII's 1891 encyclical letter Rerum novarum, which advocated economic distributism and condemned socialism. According to Pope Benedict XVI, its purpose \\"is simply to help purify reason and to contribute, here and now, to the acknowledgment and attainment of what is just…. [The Church] has to play her part through rational argument and she has to reawaken the spiritual energy without which justice…cannot prevail and prosper\\",(Pope Benedict XVI, Deus Caritas Est, 28). According to Pope John Paul II, its foundation \\"rests on the threefold cornerstones of human dignity, solidarity and subsidiarity\\".(John Paul II, 1999 Apostolic Exhortation, Ecclesia in America, 55). These concerns echo elements of Jewish law and the prophetic books of the Old Testament, and recall the teachings of Jesus Christ recorded in the New Testament, such as his declaration that \\"whatever you have done for one of these least brothers of Mine, you have done for Me.\\"Matthew 25:40. Catholic social teaching is distinctive in its consistent critiques of modern social and political ideologies both of the left and of the right: liberalism, communism, socialism, libertarianism, capitalism,Quadragesimo anno, § 99 ff Fascism, and Nazism have all been condemned, at least in their pure forms, by several popes since the late nineteenth century. =Marxism= Irving Kristol posits that one reason that those who are \\"experiencing a Christian impulse, an impulse toward the imitatio Christi, would lean toward socialism ... is the attitude of Christianity toward the poor. \\" Arnold Toynbee characterized Communist ideology as a \\"Christian heresy\\" in the sense that it focused on a few elements of the faith to the exclusion of the others. Donald Treadgold interprets Toynbee's characterization as applying to Christian attitudes as opposed to Christian doctrines. In his book, \\"Moral Philosophy\\", Jacques Maritain echoed Toynbee's perspective, characterizing the teachings of Karl Marx as a \\"Christian heresy\\". After reading Maritain, Martin Luther King, Jr. commented that Marxism had arisen in response to \\"a Christian world unfaithful to its own principles.\\" Although King criticized the Soviet Marxist–Leninist Communist regime sharply, he nonetheless commented that Marx's devotion to a classless society made him almost Christian. Tragically, said King, Communist regimes created \\"new classes and a new lexicon of injustice.\\" =Christian socialism= Christian socialism generally refers to those on the Christian left whose politics are both Christian and socialist and who see these two philosophies as being interrelated. This category can include Liberation theology and the doctrine of the social gospel. The Rerum novarum encyclical of Leo XIII (1891) was the starting point of a Catholic doctrine on social questions that has been expanded and updated over the course of the 20th century. Despite the introduction of social thought as an object of religious thought, Rerum novarum explicitly rejects what it calls \\"the main tenet of socialism\\": > \\"Hence, it is clear that the main tenet of socialism, community of goods, > must be utterly rejected, since it only injures those whom it would seem > meant to benefit, is directly contrary to the natural rights of mankind, and > would introduce confusion and disorder into the commonwealth. The first and > most fundamental principle, therefore, if one would undertake to alleviate > the condition of the masses, must be the inviolability of private property.\\" > Rerum novarum, paragraph 16. The encyclical promotes a kind of corporatism based on social solidarity among the classes with respects for the needs and rights of all. In the November 1914 issue of The Christian Socialist, Episcopal bishop Franklin Spencer Spalding of Utah, U.S.A. stated: > \\"The Christian Church exists for the sole purpose of saving the human race. > So far she has failed, but I think that Socialism shows her how she may > succeed. It insists that men cannot be made right until the material > conditions be made right. Although man cannot live by bread alone, he must > have bread. Therefore the Church must destroy a system of society which > inevitably creates and perpetuates unequal and unfair conditions of life. > These unequal and unfair conditions have been created by competition. > Therefore competition must cease and cooperation take its place.\\" Despite the explicit rejection of Socialism, in the more Catholic countries of Europe the encyclical's teaching was the inspiration that led to the formation of new Christian-inspired Socialist parties. A number of Christian socialist movements and political parties throughout the world group themselves into the International League of Religious Socialists. It has member organizations in 21 countries representing 200,000 members. Christian socialists draw parallels between what some have characterized as the egalitarian and anti-establishment message of Jesus, who–according to the Gospel–spoke against the religious authorities of his time, and the egalitarian, anti-establishment, and sometimes anti-clerical message of most contemporary socialisms. Some Christian Socialists have become active Communists. This phenomenon was most common among missionaries in China, the most notable being James Gareth Endicott, who became supportive of the struggle of the Communist Party of China in the 1930s and 1940s. Michael Moore's film Capitalism: A Love Story also features a religious component where Moore examines whether or not capitalism is a sin and whether Jesus would be a capitalist, in order to shine light on the ideological contradictions among evangelical conservatives who support free market ideals. =Liberation theology= Liberation theologyIn the mass media, 'Liberation Theology' can sometimes be used loosely, to refer to a wide variety of activist Christian thought. In this article the term will be used in the narrow sense outlined here. is a Christian movement in political theology which interprets the teachings of Jesus Christ in terms of a liberation from unjust economic, political, or social conditions. It has been described by proponents as \\"an interpretation of Christian faith through the poor's suffering, their struggle and hope, and a critique of society and the Catholic faith and Christianity through the eyes of the poor\\",Berryman, Phillip, Liberation Theology: essential facts about the revolutionary movement in Latin America and beyond(1987) and by detractors as Christianized Marxism.\\"[David] Horowitz first describes liberation theology as 'a form of Marxised Christianity,' which has validity despite the awkward phrasing, but then he calls it a form of 'Marxist–Leninist ideology,' which is simply not true for most liberation theology...\\" Robert Shaffer, \\"Acceptable Bounds of Academic Discourse ,\\" Organization of American Historians Newsletter 35, November, 2007. URL retrieved 12 July 2010. Although liberation theology has grown into an international and inter-denominational movement, it began as a movement within the Roman Catholic Church in Latin America in the 1950s–1960s. Liberation theology arose principally as a moral reaction to the poverty caused by social injustice in that region. The term was coined in 1971 by the Peruvian priest Gustavo Gutiérrez, who wrote one of the movement's most famous books, A Theology of Liberation. Other noted exponents are Leonardo Boff of Brazil, Jon Sobrino of El Salvador, and Juan Luis Segundo of Uruguay.Richard P. McBrien,Catholicism(Harper Collins, 1994), chapter IV.Gustavo Gutierrez,A Theology of Liberation, First (Spanish) edition published in Lima, Peru, 1971; first English edition published by Orbis Books (Maryknoll, New York), 1973. The influence of liberation theology within the Catholic Church diminished after proponents using Marxist concepts were admonished by the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) in 1984 and 1986. The Vatican criticized certain strains of liberation theology – without actually identifying any particular strain – for focusing on institutional dimensions of sin to the exclusion of the individual; and for allegedly misidentifying the Church hierarchy as members of the privileged class.Wojda, Paul J., \\"Liberation theology\\", in R.P.

A year after his first marriage ended, he met Leslie Gale Shuman, a movie studio lawyer and social worker. They married in 2007 in a private wedding. The couple welcomed two children in quick succession, a daughter in 2008 and a son a year later. Controversy During a live on-air interview with actor Samuel L. Jackson on February 10, 2014, Rubin mistakenly asked Jackson about the success of the Super Bowl trailer advertised at the Super Bowl, which featured African American actor and former Jackson co-star Laurence Fishburne, who had reprised his role as Morpheus from The Matrix franchise for a car commercial. Jackson was offended by this mistaken reference and proceeded to 'roast' Rubin. In his apology, Rubin claimed he was referring to another commercial, also screened at the Super Bowl, for Captain America: The Winter Soldier, which did feature Jackson, and Rubin said he had not raised this during the interview itself because he felt \\"stupid\\". At the same time as saying that Jackson had misinterpreted him, Rubin nevertheless chastised himself for what he called \\"a very amateur mistake\\".

Biography Wolfgang von Dalberg was born in 1538, the son of Friedrich Kämmerer von Worms alias von Dalberg (1500–1574), and his wife Anna von Fleckenstein (d. 1564). When the cathedral chapter of Mainz Cathedral met on 19-20 April 1582 to elect a new Archbishop of Mainz, Dalberg narrowly beat out Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn, Bishop of Würzburg to become the new Archbishop. Pope Gregory XIII confirmed his election on 3 September 1582. He was ordained as a priest in 1583. In 1583 Dalberg signed a treaty with William IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, settling a long-standing border dispute between the Archbishopric of Mainz and Hesse- Kassel. In that treaty the archbishopric gave up its claims in Hesse, and Hesse-Kassel gave up its claim on Eichsfeld. Dalberg oversaw introduction of the Gregorian calendar in 1583. Dalberg was ordained as a bishop by Georg von Schönenberg, Bishop of Worms on 20 May 1584. Although a firm Roman Catholic, Dalberg strove for reconciliation with the Protestants. In the spirit of the Counter-Reformation, he performed a canonical visitation in his archdiocese. Dalberg died in Aschaffenburg on 5 April 1601 and is buried in Mainz Cathedral.

Chryst has 25 years of NFL coaching experience, working as an offensive coordinator, quarterbacks coach and tight ends coach. In San Francisco from 2011-2014 he coached Alex Smith and Colin Kaepernick. The 49ers won 54 games in that span and both quarterbacks set career records for passer rating in 2012 when Kaepernick took over for Smith Week 11 in a MNF win over the Bears. Neither QB had enough throws to qualify for the league rating title but Smith (104.3 rating) would have finished 3rd and Kaepernick (98.3 rating) would have been 7th. No NFL team has had two quarterbacks finish in the Top 10 the same season. In his 10th start of his career Kaepernick threw for over 300 yards in Super Bowl XLVII against the Ravens. Chryst worked as San Francisco's offensive coordinator in 2015 when Blaine Gabbert replaced Kaepernick Week 9. Kaepernick had played well in games early but struggled in losses to division foes Arizona, Seattle and St. Louis. Gabbert went on that year to lead the NFL in Red Zone Passing (120.5). He also has NFL experience with Denver (2017-18) Carolina (2006–10), Arizona (2001–03, 1996–98), San Diego (1999-2000) and Chicago (1991-95). Chryst is credited with developing the original Draft Value Chart in 1993. Chicago Bears head coach Dave Wannstedt had replaced Mike Ditka and wanted a chart that would mimic the philosophy that Jimmy Johnson was implementing in Dallas, where Wannstedt was his defensive coordinator. The chart was used on draft day by a handful of teams who kept it hidden from others to create value for the trading of draft picks. Wannstedt shared the chart back to Johnson, but others made copies and it worked its way throughout the league. In addition to his coaching and quality control duties Chryst has specialized in football analytics. He was involved in a Silicon Valley startup as a founder of Game Analytics, Inc. and has consulted both college and NFL teams on Game Management. Early years Chryst played football and baseball at Princeton University. Chryst earned his bachelor's degree in history from Princeton. He then went on to receive his master's degree in educational administration from Wisconsin. Coaching career =College= Chryst first became a coach at the University of Wisconsin-Platteville in 1987. While there, he also helped at the Chicago Bears training camp. In 1988, he was a coach with the Wisconsin Badgers before spending the next two years as the quarterbacks and offensive line coach of the Wyoming Cowboys. His professional coaching debut came as wide receivers/running backs coach for the Orlando Thunder of the World League in 1991. =NFL= Chryst began his NFL coaching career with the Chicago Bears in 1991, working for five seasons as the team's director of research/quality control. In the spring of 1992, Chryst took a 15-day hiatus from the Bears to long snap in three playoff games for the Orlando Thunder. Chryst then worked two different three-year stints with Arizona, coaching tight ends (1996–97) and quarterbacks (1998, 2001–03). In between Chryst's time in Arizona, he worked two seasons with the Chargers (1999-00) as the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. Chryst helped implement the no-huddle offense in San Diego in 1999. Chryst joined the Carolina Panthers in 2006 and spent five seasons as the tight ends coach and offensive quality control coach alongside Mike McCoy. Chryst left the Panthers after the 2010 season to become the quarterbacks coach for the San Francisco 49ers. He was eventually promoted to offensive coordinator prior to the 2015 season, under head coach Jim Tomsula. During Chryst's five seasons in San Francisco, the 49ers advanced to three consecutive NFC Championship Games (2011–13) in addition to competing in Super Bowl XLVII. Chryst helped San Francisco's passing offense rank among the most efficient units in the NFL from 2011-14 while working with QBs Alex Smith and Colin Kaepernick. Personal life Chryst is the brother of Wisconsin Badgers head football coach Paul Chryst and former Mid-American Conference commissioner Rick Chryst. Their father, George, was an assistant at Wisconsin and then became the head coach and athletic director at the University of Wisconsin–Platteville. His oldest son, Keller Chryst, played quarterback at the University of Tennessee. Prior to Tennessee he went 11-2 as a starter at quarterback for Stanford University (2014-17). His .846 winning percentage is the highest all-time for Stanford quarterbacks with a minimum of 10 starts. His younger son, Jackson Chryst was the 2018 San Francisco Chronicle Player of the Year as quarterback for Palo Alto High School, and is currently playing football as a quarterback at Oregon State University. He also has a daughter, Gillian Chryst, who made the Dean's List graduating from the University of Alabama and currently resides in Texas.

This innovative exercise—claimed to be a world first—caught media attention, making BBC television news, BBC Radio London, TalkSport, Radio New Zealand; and being written about by The Guardian, The Observer and MetroMetro, 15 April 2011 and mentioned on Twitter by Stephen Fry, the BBC's Rory Cellan-Jones and Jonathan Agnew (BBC cricket correspondent).  Background  The event was conceived by consultant John Popham after seeing two comments on Twitter; in the first Dan Slee expressed his hopes for keeping up with a local village cricket team via Twitter. Then, Chris Conder (@cyberdoyle) mentioned that she was testing a new 30Mbps, symmetrical internet connection, recently installed by Lancaster University in her village, Wray, in Lancashire, England, one of only three villages in the UK to have a symmetrical community network. On learning from Conder that Wray was to hold a special cricket match part of the village's annual Scarecrow Festival, billed as Wray vs. the Rest of the World, Popham decided to broadcast it to the world to demonstrate the potential of high-speed synchronous broadband. He explained: In a retrospective blog post, he explained: The match The match was 20 overs per side (the Twenty20 format), with any batsman reaching 20 runs required to retire. Wray won the toss, and elected to bowl first. After 20 overs, The Rest of the World were 69 for 5, leaving Wray needing 70 runs off 20 overs, which they achieved with a final six, in their eleventh over, winning by 8 wickets. The post-match tug o'war contest (won by Rest of World, 2 out of 3) was also streamed live, as were interviews with various participants. Media  One of the three cameras, plus crew. Note microphone on boundary-line, with red lead. The event was streamed online on Bambuser with technical support from Birmingham company Aquila TV who used two Sony Z1 cameras and a DSR 350. The stream was watched by a peak of 2,733 viewers. A separate audio commentary was broadcast on-line, by Radio Youthology, attracting 1,780 listeners; their highest figure ever. Also attending were a BBC North West television news crew, whose film was broadcast the same evening. The related hashtag #twicket was trending on Twitter shortly before the end of the match. The match also made a star out of local commenter, Brenda, who drank Pimm's throughout the game.

These surfaces have the symmetries of a crystallographic group. Numerous examples are known with cubic, tetragonal, rhombohedral, and orthorhombic symmetries. Monoclinic and triclinic examples are certain to exist, but have proven hard to parametrise.http://epinet.anu.edu.au/mathematics/minimal_surfaces TPMS are of relevance in natural science. TPMS have been observed as biological membranes, as block copolymers, equipotential surfaces in crystals etc. They have also been of interest in architecture, design and art.  Properties  Nearly all studied TPMS are free of self-intersections (i.e. embedded in ℝ3): from a mathematical standpoint they are the most interesting (since self-intersecting surfaces are trivially abundant). All connected TPMS have genus ≥ 3, and in every lattice there exist orientable embedded TPMS of every genus ≥3. Embedded TPMS are orientable and divide space into two disjoint sub-volumes (labyrinths). If they are congruent the surface is said to be a balance surface.  History  Schwarz P surface The first examples of TPMS were the surfaces described by Schwarz in 1865, followed by a surface described by his student E. R. Neovius in 1883.H. A. Schwarz, Gesammelte Mathematische Abhandlungen, Springer, Berlin, 1933.E. R. Neovius, \\"Bestimmung zweier spezieller periodischer Minimal Flachen\\", Akad. Abhandlungen, Helsingfors, 1883. In 1970 Alan Schoen came up with 12 new TPMS based on skeleton graphs spanning crystallographic cells.Alan H. Schoen, Infinite periodic minimal surfaces without self-intersections, NASA Technical Note TN D-5541 (1970) While Schoen's surfaces became popular in natural science the construction did not lend itself to a mathematical existence proof and remained largely unknown in mathematics, until H. Karcher proved their existence in 1989. Using conjugate surfaces many more surfaces were found. While Weierstrass representations are known for the simpler examples, they are not known for many surfaces. Instead methods from Discrete differential geometry are often used.  Families  The classification of TPMS is an open problem. TPMS often come in families that can be continuously deformed into each other. Meeks found an explicit 5-parameter family for genus 3 TPMS that contained all then known examples of genus 3 surfaces except the gyroid.William H. Meeks, III. The Geometry and the Conformal Structure of Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces in R3. PhD thesis, University of California, Berkeley, 1975. Members of this family can be continuously deformed into each other, remaining embedded in the process (although the lattice may change). The gyroid and lidinoid are each inside a separate 1-parameter family.Adam G. Weyhaupt. New families of embedded triply periodic minimal surfaces of genus three in euclidean space. PhD thesis, Indiana University, 2006 Another approach to classifying TPMS is to examine their space groups. For surfaces containing lines the possible boundary polygons can be enumerated, providing a classification.  Generalisations  Periodic minimal surfaces can be constructed in S3 and H3.K. Polthier. New periodic minimal surfaces in h3. In G. Dziuk, G. Huisken, and J. Hutchinson, editors, Theoretical and Numerical Aspects of Geometric Variational Problems, volume 26, pages 201–210. CMA Canberra, 1991. It is possible to generalise the division of space into labyrinths to find triply periodic (but possibly branched) minimal surfaces that divide space into more than two sub-volumes. Quasiperiodic minimal surfaces have been constructed in ℝ2×S1.Laurent Mazet, Martin Traizet, A quasi-periodic minimal surface, Commentarii Mathematici Helvetici, pp. 573–601, 2008 It has been suggested but not been proven that minimal surfaces with a quasicrystalline order in ℝ3 exist.

Swinburne was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm off break. He was born in Wath-upon-Dearne, Yorkshire and educated at Wath Grammar School and Leeds University.Published under Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians. Swinburne first played county cricket for Devon, making his debut for the county in the 1964 Minor Counties Championship against Berkshire. He continued to play Minor counties cricket for Devon until 1969, in which time he made 46 appearances for the county. Swinburne joined Northamptonshire in 1970, making his first-class debut in the County Championship against Warwickshire. He played first-class cricket for Northamptonshire from 1970 to 1974, making 29 first-class appearances. A tailend batsman, Swinburne scored 159 runs in first-class cricket at a batting average of just 5.67. His position within the team was that of a bowler. He took 83 wickets for Northamptonshire at a bowling average of 27.48, with four five wicket hauls and one ten wicket haul in a match. His best innings bowling figures came against Warwickshire in 1971, with Swinburne taking figures of 6/57 to guide Northamptonshire to a close 46 run win. It was also for Northamptonshire that he made his debut in List A cricket, in the 1971 John Player League against Middlesex. In this match he bowled 4 wicket-less overs in what was his only List A appearance for the county. Following the end of his first-class career at the end of the 1974 season, he joined Shropshire for the 1975 season, for whom he played 20 Minor Counties Championship matches till 1977, while playing at club level for Old Hill. He played his second and final List A match for Shropshire in the 1976 Gillette Cup against Yorkshire.

The episode originally aired on April 11, 2011 on NBC. In this episode, the police investigate a quinceañera massacre; one of them may pay the ultimate price, and a district attorney is set to take the law back into his own hands. Plot When a normal quinceañera erupts in violence when several men masked in bandanas open fire on the party leaving multiple people dead, Detectives Winters and Jaruszalski quickly follow leads. During their search for answers, they find an eleven-year-old Yaqui Indian boy from Sonora, Mexico named Fernando (Quinton Lopez) protecting acres of marijuana in Zuma Canyon, and discover he is the only witness that can help the case, although he doesn't talk and tell them who he is because he fears the man with \\"snakes feet\\" – Caesar Vargas (Jose Pablo Cantillo), who owned the marijuana field. The police place him in Eastlake Juvenile Facility, under a pseudonym for his own protection. As the detectives begin to close in on the suspect, Winters receives a surprise visit at home where a car slows down in front of his house, just before a gunman opens fire, Winters getting shot in the side protecting his daughter Lily (Caitlin Carmichael). While Casey (Teri Polo) performs CPR, their telephone rings; Cesar's filtered voice leaves an ominous message on the answering machine – Winters dies in the hospital, causing everyone to grieve, even various police officers and members of the district attorney's office that were in the waiting area. Meanwhile, DDA Morales risks upsetting the Mexican government by prosecuting the guilty. Morales calls Deputy Ortega (Al Espinosa) of the Mexican consulate corrupt and accuses him of knowing Vargas and leaking information about Fernando's location to Cesar Vargas, which Ortega denies, although to keep the police off him he told Morales that Caesar was seeking refuge and asking to be repatriated. Morales later takes heat from D.A. Jerry Hardin (Peter Coyote), who initially insisted on waiting until Vargas was back in Mexico to formally extradite him. Hardin secretly had the deputy assistant attorney general of Mexico listening in on the telephone to get Mexican Consul General Efraim Contreras and Ortega to deal to bluff Vargas into thinking he was going to Mexico. Instead, Jaruszalski pulls Cesar out of the back seat of an SUV and arrests him. Later, Morales promised to move Fernando's family to Los Angeles, in exchange for Fernando's testimony; but Bo Washburn; a representative from the State Department, declined his request. Morales ambushes him with an emergency petition to compel the State Department to grant asylum to Fernando's family in federal court. Morales appeals to the judge, and eventually Fernando is reunited with his family. Before trial is set to start and Fernando is set to be called to the witness stand, he is found in a pool of blood, his throat cut – a woman posed as the interpreter assigned to Fernando committed the crime, likely hired by Vargas. With Fernando dead, Morales's case got thrown out and Caesar Vargas walked – the courtroom shocked. Morales wonders how it will look for the DA's office if he quits and returns to the police force, because his boss is too vain to ask for help in bringing a cop killer to justice. Though Hardin turned the tables, spinning Morales' move as a resignation after being replaced as the prosecutor in Vargas' case, Hardin will say the case needed a fresh pair of eyes, and even if it took 10 years, they would prosecute Vargas. Later on, Morales walks in with a box of his belongings; wearing an LAPD badge, he sets them down on an empty desk while Jaruszalski is watching by a window. Production The episode was written by Richard Sweren and directed by Tom DiCillo. Stars Skeet Ulrich, Regina Hall and Megan Boone had to depart the cast due to a casting overhaul in January 2011, which in turn Skeet Ulrich was replaced by Alfred Molina whose role changed from lead prosecutor to lead detective in the next episode.

Leaves on the stem become smaller toward the top. The inflorescence is a number of clusters of flowers, one at the tip of the stem and a few along the sides of the upper stem. The flower is bright pink with a thin tubular throat up to long opening into five pointed lobes each nearly in length. Blooming occurs in July through September.Ipomopsis sancti-spiritus. New Mexico Rare Plants. The plant most often grows on steep, west-facing limestone slopes next to a road in one canyon in the Santa Fe National Forest. Other plants in the area include ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii), mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus montanus), Woods' rose (Rosa woodsii), poison ivy (Toxicodendron rydbergii), Indian hemp (Apocynum cannabinum), western yarrow (Achillea millefolium), and white ragweed (Hymenopappus newberryi). The plant grows on bare soils, and probably requires periodic disturbance to keep its habitat clear of competing vegetation. It does not tolerate shade or an accumulation of leaf litter. This buildup of tinder increase the likelihood of a large wildfire, which could conceivably destroy the whole population; conservation efforts include clearing overgrown brush and flammable material. This species has low fecundity, rarely reproducing successfully, with fewer than 10% of flowers producing fruits and the fruits containing few viable seeds.Ipomopsis sancti-spiritus.

Little Castle chapel Little Castle defense tower Little Castle () in Kamnik, Slovenia, once formed part of a castle constructed in the 11th or early 12th century at the strategic site above the narrow passage near an important trail. The Romanesque chapel of St. Eligius is one of the most important Slovene medieval monuments, despite later alterations, and is one of the oldest of its kind in Europe. The chapel features a wooden ceiling and exquisite fresco paintings. Kamnik's Medieval Days festival takes place at the foot of the castle every June.Culture SL: Mali grad  History  Archaeological evidence indicates a cultic centre here in pre-Antiquity. The castle was first mentioned in 1202, but is of older origin. At the end of the 13th century, the castle burned; the northeast part was demolished and never rebuilt. The remainder of the castle was torn down in the 16th century after the 1511 Idrija earthquake, leaving only the three- storey Romanesque chapel built between the 11th and 15th centuries. One can still see the remnants of defensive walls and the recently restored defensive tower.  Chapel  The first chapel of St. Margaret with a crypt, the presbytery of today's lower chapel, was built around 1100. When the nave was added, the Romanesque portal with a lunette was displaced. In the 13th century the chapel's second floor was built, dedicated to Bartholomew the Apostle, with a Gothic vault build after 1470. The lower chapel was than dedicated to St. Eligius, decorated again after 1771 with frescos by Janez Potočnik. The entire chapel was rebuilt in Baroque style around 1700. Inside there are also remnants of Gothic and Baroque frescos.  A folk legend  Countess Veronika, who was stingy, once lived in Little Castle. One day three priests visited her, asking her for money to renovate the church. Veronika replied that she would rather turn into a snake than to give them money. No sooner had she finished speaking when lightning struck her and she became half snake and half human. She can only be saved by seven-year boy who will whip her three times on the back.

The Mathias Colomb Indian band, now Mathias Colomb Cree Nation, was formed as a separate reserve in 1910 and officially recognized by the Canadian federal government in 2011.

A severe housing shortage had as many as 25 people sharing a small house, eating and showering in shifts. The community had few amenities because a diesel spill caused by faulty equipment installed by Indian Affairs and Manitoba Hydro during the 1970s had contaminated the town centre, causing the band hall, nursing station, school and about 100 houses to be torn down. Violence, substance abuse and poverty prevailed in Pukatawagan for decades while the community argued with mainstream officials about who was responsible and who would pay for cleaning up the mess and rebuilding. In his report, based on his visit to Pukatawagan and other First Nations and Inuit communities in Canada in October 2013, James Anaya, the United Nations special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, reported that \\"The well-being gap between aboriginal and non-aboriginal people in Canada has not narrowed over the last several years, treaty and aboriginals claims remain persistently unresolved, and overall there appear to be high levels of distrust among aboriginal peoples toward government at both the federal and provincial levels. Canada consistently ranks near the top among countries with respect to human development standards, and yet amidst this wealth and prosperity, aboriginal people live in conditions akin to those in countries that rank much lower and in which poverty abounds.

The name is probably a loanword of Armenian origin; in the Ottoman Empire, \\"bennâk\\" came to mean a landless peasant, or a man who had married but not yet established his own household. \\"Bennâk\\" was also a term for a small area of farmland, less than half a çift. The resm-i bennâk was usually paid annually, on 1 March, by the head of a family who is either landless or has very little land - not enough to be assessed for resm-i çift. The tax was payable to the timar-holder or to a tax-farmer in their stead. The rate of resm-i bennâk was generally lower than the resm-i çift. For instance, in the provincial tax code of Hüdavendigar in 1487, a married man with his own farm might pay the full resm-i çift rate of 40 akçes; a bennâk would pay 12 akçes, and a mücerred (bachelor) would pay 6 akçes (see also resm-i mücerred). In some cases, bennâk was only paid by peasants in the Ottoman Empire who had a small but nonzero area of land to farm; the truly landless peasants would pay a caba tax in which case the remaining bennak might be called \\"ekinlü-bennâk\\". Academics might be exempted. Miners were also exempted from many taxes, and the resm-i bennâk was no exemption - for example, sipahis who worked in saltpetre mines would be exempt from resm-i bennâk, resm-i çift, and caba; they would also be exempted from avariz and other taxes. Some of the sadat - those claiming descent from Muhammed - were initially exempted from paying resm-i bennâk, but this exemption was eroded over time. There were even cases of people forging certificates of ancestry in order to claim tax exemptions.

History  From 1882, the main library was in Reading Town Hall. However, as early as World War I complaints were being made there was insufficient space for books and readers. It was only in 1982 that plans started being laid for a new central library in Reading, and building starting in 1984. This new building was opened in 1985. The central library is in the heart of Reading on Abbey Square on the corner of the King's Road, on the former site of the Reading Abbey stables where the horses of medieval churchmen, nobility and royalty were stabled. It is also very near the old Abbey gateway, where Jane Austen went to school, and which is the ancestor of the current Abbey School. Reading Central Library is a four storey red brick building based on traditional Reading brick designs. The Holy Brook runs underneath the Library and it is near The Oracle to the south west and to the north lies the beautiful Forbury Gardens. The Central Library contains over 100,000 books including a children’s library, a large selection of fiction and non fiction books, and free Internet terminals provided as part of The People's Network. It also provides loans of CDs, DVDs, and videos for which there is a small charge and also has a large collection of vocal and drama sets on the second floor. The Third floor contains the Reading Local Studies Library which has large collections of books, photographs, maps and newspapers relating to the history of Reading and Berkshire, as well as a family history section. Special collections include books and letters by local author Mary Russell Mitford and local MP, judge and author Thomas Noon Talfourd. Books in the library are generally ordered by Dewey Decimal Classification, though the Local Studies collection has its own library classification system. The online library catalogue which includes a selection of digitised local Studies photographs can be found on the library website. It is run by a team of qualified librarians with the support of library assistants with the aim of providing good library services to the people of Reading.

They first entered the FA Cup in 1884 and, in 1885, reached the second round. Rovers were one of the founder members of the Lancashire League in 1889, but predominantly competed in the Lancashire Combination between 1894 and 1909. In 1909, after leaving the second division of the Combination, they played their final game in the FA Cup.  History  The team in the 1890s Oswaldtwistle Rovers were based in the town of Oswaldtwistle, near to Accrington, in Lancashire. Aside from friendly matches, they played in a number of competitions, including the FA Cup, the Lancashire League and the Lancashire Combination. The first of their 22 appearances in the FA Cup came in the 1884–85 season, where they lost 12–0 to local side Blackburn Olympic in the first round. However, Olympic were a strong team who had won the cup in 1882–83 – the first time it had been won by a northern team. They fared better in 1885–86, beating Lower Darwen 3–1 in the first round. They were then paired against another local side, cup-holders Blackburn Rovers in the next round. They lost the game 1–0, with the goal scored by Hugh McIntyre; only a thousand spectators attended the game, which suggests that the two Rovers were not big rivals, despite their proximity. Blackburn Rovers went on to retain the cup that year. Oswaldtwistle never again made it to the second round of the FA Cup. In the 1888–89 season, qualifying rounds were introduced for the first time. That year, Rovers entered at the second qualifying round, winning 3–1 at Blackburn Olympic, before losing to South Shore, who went on to become Blackpool F.C. In the same year, Rovers won the Lancashire Junior Cup. In February 1888, they also hosted Newton Heath – who would later change their name to Manchester United – in a friendly match that they won 6–0. In 1889, Oswaldtwistle were one of the founder members of the Lancashire League. However, they struggled in that league, and left at the end of the 1890–91 season, having finished bottom of the table with only one win from 20 matches. In 1894 they entered the Lancashire Combination, a league generally populated by small local sides and the reserve teams of the larger Lancashire clubs. They ended the campaign in fourth place in the division, their highest ever league position. The team left the Combination in 1897, but returned three years later. They were then relegated to the Second Division of the Combination in 1904. Oswaldtwistle left the league at the end of the 1908–09 campaign, during which the side had conceded 137 goals. Oswaldtwistle are not thought to have survived for long after leaving the league.

They were employed in the service of the British colonial administration as domestic gardeners in a number of cantonments. These Lodha acquired the name Ghasiara on the account of the fact that they were employed as grass cutters. The word ghahas in Hindi means grass, and ghasiara is literally means a grass cutter.

Generalizations: # An isoptic is the set of points for which two tangents of a given curve meet at a fixed angle (see below). # An isoptic of two plane curves is the set of points for which two tangents meet at a fixed angle. # Thales' theorem on a chord can be considered as the orthoptic of two circles which are degenerated to the two points and . Orthoptic of a parabola  Any parabola can be transformed by a rigid motion (angles are not changed) into a parabola with equation y=ax^2. The slope at a point of the parabola is m=2ax. Replacing x gives the parametric representation of the parabola with the tangent slope as parameter:  (tfrac{m}{2a},tfrac{m^2}{4a}); . The tangent has the equation y=mx+n with the still unknown n, which can be determined by inserting the coordinates of the parabola point. One gets  y=mx-tfrac{m^2}{4a}; . If a tangent contains the point , off the parabola, then the equation :y_0=m x_0 -frac{m^2}{4a}quad rightarrow quad m^2-4ax_0;m +4ay_0=0 holds, which has two solutions and corresponding to the two tangents passing . The free term of a reduced quadratic equation is always the product of its solutions. Hence, if the tangents meet at orthogonally, the following equations hold: :m_1m_2=-1=4ay_0 The last equation is equivalent to :y_0=-frac{1}{4a}; , which is the equation of the directrix.  Orthoptic of an ellipse and hyperbola  = Ellipse = Let ; E:; tfrac{x^2}{a^2}+tfrac{y^2}{b^2}=1 ; be the ellipse of consideration. (1) The tangents of ellipse E at neighbored vertices intersect at one of the 4 points (pm a, pm b), which lie on the desired orthoptic curve (circle x^2+y^2=a^2+b^2). (2) The tangent at a point (u,v) of the ellipse E has the equation tfrac{u}{a^2}x+tfrac{v}{b^2}y = 1 (s. Ellipse). If the point is not a vertex this equation can be solved:  y=-tfrac{b^2u}{a^2v};x;+;tfrac{b^2}{v}; . Using the abbreviations (I); m=-tfrac{b^2u}{a^2v},; {color{red}n=tfrac{b^2}{v}}; and the equation ; {color{blue}tfrac{u^2}{a^2}=1-tfrac{v^2}{b^2}=1-tfrac{b^2}{n^2}}; one gets: :m^2=frac{b^4u^2}{a^4v^2}=frac{1}{a^2}{color{red}frac{b^4}{v^2}}{color{blue}frac{u^2}{a^2}}=frac{1}{a^2}{color{red}n^2}{color{blue}(1-frac{b^2}{n^2})}=frac{n^2-b^2}{a^2}; . Hence  (II); n=pmsqrt{m^2a^2+b^2} and the equation of a non vertical tangent is :y=m;x;pmsqrt{m^2a^2+b^2}. Solving relations (I) for u,v and respecting (II) leads to the slope depending parametric representation of the ellipse: :(u,v)=(-tfrac{ma^2}{pmsqrt{m^2a^2+b^2}};,;tfrac{b^2}{pmsqrt{m^2a^2+b^2}}) . (For another proof: see Ellipse.) If a tangent contains the point (x_0,y_0), off the ellipse, then the equation :y_0=m x_0 pm sqrt{m^2a^2+b^2} holds. Eliminating the square root leads to :m^2-frac{2x_0y_0}{x_0^2-a^2}m + frac{y_0^2-b^2}{x_0^2-a^2}=0, which has two solutions (x_0,y_0) corresponding to the two tangents passing (x_0,y_0). The free term of a reduced quadratic equation is always the product of its solutions. Hence, if the tangents meet at (x_0,y_0) orthogonally, the following equations hold: Orthoptics (red circles) of a circle, ellipses and hyperbolas :m_1m_2=-1=frac{y_0^2-b^2}{x_0^2-a^2} The last equation is equivalent to :x_0^2+y_0^2=a^2+b^2; . From (1) and (2) one gets: * The intersection points of orthogonal tangents are points of the circle x^2+y^2=a^2+b^2 . = Hyperbola = The ellipse case can be adopted nearly exactly to the hyperbola case. The only changes to be made are to replace b^2 with -b^2 and to restrict to . Therefore: * The intersection points of orthogonal tangents are points of the circle x^2+y^2=a^2-b^2, where .  Orthoptic of an astroid  Orthoptic (purple) of an astroid An astroid can be described by the parametric representation :vec c(t)=left(cos^3t,sin^3tright), quad 0le t<2pi. From the condition :vec dot c(t)cdotvec dot c(t+alpha)=0 one recognizes the distance in parameter space at which an orthogonal tangent to appears. It turns out that the distance is independent of parameter , namely . The equations of the (orthogonal) tangents at the points and are respectively: :begin{align} y&=-tan t left(x-cos^3 tright)+sin^3t,  y&=frac{1}{tan t} left(x+sin^3 tright)+cos^3t. end{align} Their common point has coordinates: :begin{align} x&=sin tcos t(sin t-cos t),  y&=sin tcos t(sin t+cos t). end{align} This is simultaneously a parametric representation of the orthoptic. Elimination of the parameter yields the implicit representation :2left(x^2+y^2right)^3-left(x^2-y^2right)^2=0. Introducing the new parameter one gets :begin{align} x&=tfrac{1}{sqrt{2}}cos(2varphi)cosvarphi,  y&=tfrac{1}{sqrt{2}}cos(2varphi)sinvarphi. end{align} (The proof uses the angle sum and difference identities.) Hence we get the polar representation :r=tfrac{1}{sqrt{2}}cos(2varphi), quad 0le varphi <2pi of the orthoptic. Hence: * The orthoptic of an astroid is a quadrifolium.  Isoptic of a parabola, an ellipse and a hyperbola  Isoptics (purple) of a parabola for angles 80° and 100° Isoptics (purple) of an ellipse for angles 80° and 100° Isoptics (purple) of a hyperbola for angles 80° and 100° Below the isotopics for angles are listed. They are called -isoptics. For the proofs see below. = Equations of the isoptics = ; Parabola: The -isoptics of the parabola with equation are the branches of the hyperbola :x^2-tan^2alphaleft(y+frac{1}{4a}right)^2-frac{y}{a}=0. The branches of the hyperbola provide the isoptics for the two angles and (see picture). ; Ellipse: The -isoptics of the ellipse with equation are the two parts of the degree-4 curve :left(x^2+y^2-a^2-b^2right)^2tan^2alpha=4left(a^2y^2+b^2x^2-a^2b^2right) (see picture). ; Hyperbola: The -isoptics of the hyperbola with the equation are the two parts of the degree-4 curve :left(x^2+y^2-a^2+b^2right)^2tan^2alpha=4left(a^2y^2-b^2x^2+a^2b^2right). = Proofs = ; Parabola: A parabola can be parametrized by the slope of its tangents : :vec c(m)=left(frac{m}{2a},frac{m^2}{4a}right), quad m in R. The tangent with slope has the equation :y=mx-frac{m^2}{4a}. The point is on the tangent if and only if :y_0=mx_0-frac{m^2}{4a}. This means the slopes , of the two tangents containing fulfil the quadratic equation :m^2 - 4ax_0m + 4ay_0=0. If the tangents meet at angle or , the equation :tan^2alpha=left(frac{m_1-m_2}{1+m_1m_2}right)^2 must be fulfilled. Solving the quadratic equation for , and inserting , into the last equation, one gets :x_0^2-tan^2alphaleft(y_0+frac{1}{4a}right)^2-frac{y_0}{a}=0. This is the equation of the hyperbola above. Its branches bear the two isoptics of the parabola for the two angles and . ; Ellipse: In the case of an ellipse one can adopt the idea for the orthoptic for the quadratic equation :m^2-frac{2x_0y_0}{x_0^2-a^2}m + frac{y_0^2-b^2}{x_0^2-a^2}=0. Now, as in the case of a parabola, the quadratic equation has to be solved and the two solutions , must be inserted into the equation :tan^2alpha=left(frac{m_1-m_2}{1+m_1m_2}right)^2. Rearranging shows that the isoptics are parts of the degree-4 curve: :left(x_0^2+y_0^2-a^2-b^2right)^2tan^2alpha=4left(a^2y_0^2+b^2x_0^2-a^2b^2right). ; Hyperbola: The solution for the case of a hyperbola can be adopted from the ellipse case by replacing with (as in the case of the orthoptics, see above).

Scheinberg, No. 1:10-cr-00336 (2011), is a United States federal criminal case against the founders of the three largest online poker companies, PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker and Cereus (Absolute Poker/Ultimatebet), and a handful of their associates, which alleges that the defendants violated the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) and engaged in bank fraud and money laundering to process transfers to and from their customers. A companion civil case, United States v. PokerStars, et al., 11 Civ. 2564 (2011), included Full Tilt and Cereus as defendants and seeks the recovery of forfeiture equalling approximately $3 billion in assets belonging to the companies. After the indictment was unsealed on April 15, 2011, a date quickly dubbed Black Friday by the online poker community, PokerStars and Full Tilt stopped offering real money play to their United States customers. Three years after the start of the poker boom in 2003, the U.S. Congress passed UIGEA to extend existing gambling laws into cyberspace. The law made processing payments for illegal online gambling a crime; however, the defendant companies remained in the U.S. market in the belief that the law did not cover poker. A former payment processor for the companies turned state's evidence after initially being charged with violating UIGEA himself. On September 20, the civil suit was amended claiming individual fraud by Messrs. Howard Lederer, Chris Ferguson and Rafael Furst. The U.S. Department of Justice seized the .com internet addresses of the three online gambling sites, replacing them with a takedown notice, but let Full Tilt and PokerStars use them again once they pledged to no longer serve the U.S. About 76 bank accounts in 14 countries were frozen, including an unknown amount of player funds. The prosecutors are seeking jail sentences for the 11 criminal defendants including site founders and executives, U.S. payment processors, and an executive of a small Utah bank, who prosecutors maintain were engaged in an elaborate criminal fraud scheme, using the bank in Utah to mis-code transactions with other banks to bypass UIGEA restrictions. Antigua and Barbuda officials considered action in the World Trade Organization. The companies ceased their U.S.-facing ad campaigns, resulting in cancellations of poker-themed television shows. In June, Full Tilt's eGambling license was suspended, which halted all of its remaining online play. The Alderney Gambling Control Commission on the British Channel Islands later revoked its license on September 29. On July 31, 2012, US government dismissed \\"with prejudice\\" all civil complaints against all PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker companies after coming to a settlement with PokerStars which includes PokerStars purchasing Full Tilt. PokerStars and Full Tilt admitted no wrongdoing as part of the settlement, which ends all litigation between the government and the poker companies. The criminal indictments remain in place for the named individuals. Background =Growth of poker= In 2003, ESPN expanded its coverage of the World Series of Poker. Between 2003 and 2006 the number of contestants in the $10,000 No Limit Texas hold'em Main Event grew from 839 to 8773. After the UIGEA was passed the World Series of Poker main event decreased in size, to 6358 players in 2007. In 2015 6420 players participated. =Changes in gambling laws= On October 13, 2006, the United States Congress passed Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, which makes it a federal offense, punishable by up to five years in prison, for a gambling business to \\"knowingly accept\\" payments \\"in connection with the participation of another person in unlawful Internet gambling.\\" However, according to syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum, the law did not define or alter the definition of unlawful gambling, which under Federal law only applies to sports betting via the Wire Act. Nevertheless, Party Poker, at the time the largest provider for U.S. demand, decided to withdraw from servicing the United States poker market. The United States Department of Justice later indicted them for services provided prior to 2006 in violation of the Wire Act, a case they settled out of court in the hopes of being allowed to serve the U.S. market at a later date. Also in 2006, several other online poker service providers withdrew from the market, including Sportingbet's Paradise Poker, 888 Holdings' Pacific Poker, and the iPoker Network's CD Poker. Several other sites continued to facilitate the demand for online poker in the U.S., which had been growing about 20% per year. A 2006 law passed in Washington state that made it a felony to play online poker was upheld as constitutional by the Washington Supreme Court in September 2010. PokerStars immediately withdrew from Washington's market, and Full Tilt soon followed suit, but both sites continued to provide services to players in the other 49 U.S. states. This case was preceded by a 2009 seizure of $34 million worth of winnings in transit U.S. poker players (q.v. Southern District of New York action against online poker players). =Basis for the case= Since Federal law says nothing specifically about online poker, or any gambling other than sports betting, Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, bases his case on a New York law that makes it a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in prison, to run a game of chance where bets are placed within the state. Although none of the sites are actually run out of New York (PokerStars is based on the Isle of Man, Full Tilt Poker is in Ireland and Absolute Poker is from Costa Rica), he was able to obtain a felony indictment for UIGEA violations. In addition to the 2006 UIGEA, the defendants were charged with violating the Illegal Gambling Business Act (18 USC 1955). Additionally, in April 2010, the former head of Intabill, a defunct payment processor in Australia, Daniel Tzvetkoff, was arrested in Las Vegas by the FBI. He was charged with money laundering, bank fraud, and wire fraud. PokerStars and Full Tilt had previously claimed that Tzvetkoff cheated them out of at least $100 million. However, he was quietly let go a few months later in August 2010. He reportedly turned state's evidence after being threatened with a 75-year prison sentence for alleged UIGEA violations. The indictment also alleged that the executive officers of the sites had sought investment in SunFirst Bank in Utah, which they were using to obtain and pay out player funds by allegedly mis-coding transactions. Although no one was actually being defrauded per se, and money from an otherwise legal operation cannot be \\"laundered\\", these actions formed the basis for the fraud and money laundering charges. This case marks only the second time that the Department of Justice has alleged violations of the UIGEA, after the indictment of Daniel Tzvetkoff. A grand jury handed down a sealed indictment on March 10, 2011. Domain name seizure On April 15, the Department of Justice seized the .com internet addresses of the three online gambling sites, a total of five URLs: Pokerstars.com, Fulltiltpoker.com, Absolutepoker.com, Ultimatebet.com and UB.com. On April 20, 2011, use of two of the domain names were returned to PokerStars and Full Tilt by the U.S. Attorney's office, \\"to facilitate the withdrawal of U.S. players' funds held in account with the companies\\"; in exchange the companies agreed to continue prohibiting United States residents from playing until the case was resolved. Ultimate control of the domains remains in the hands of US Attorney's office. Because the charges against Absolute Poker and UltimateBet represent a much larger percentage of its revenues, their survival is in jeopardy. However, Cereus did eventually reach an agreement by which funds could be returned to United States players. On July 31, 2012, US government dismissed \\"with prejudice\\" all civil complaints against all PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker companies after coming to a settlement with PokerStars which includes PokerStars purchasing Full Tilt. PokerStars and Full Tilt admitted no wrongdoing as part of the settlement, which ends all litigation between the government and the companies. The criminal indictments remain in place for the named individuals. Accounts seized About 76 bank accounts in 14 countries were then frozen, preventing players from accessing balances held by the companies, according to the FBI's New York office. That Full Tilt and Pokerstars accepted a total of $500 million in total player deposits is a conservative estimate. Persons indicted The indictment named eleven individuals who were each charged with four crimes. The persons named in the indictment are: *Isai Scheinberg, founder of PokerStars *Paul Tate, Director of Payments for PokerStars *Raymond Bitar, CEO of TiltWare - software company for Full Tilt Poker *Nelson Burtwick, Directory of Payments TiltWare (current)- software company for Full Tilt Poker. Past Director of Payments for PokerStars *Scott Tom, part owner of Absolute Poker *Brent Beckley, Director of Payments and Risk Management at Absolute Poker (as of 2007) *Ryan Lang, payment processor *Ira Rubin, payment processor *Bradley Franzen, payment processor *Chad Elie, payment processor *John Campos, Vice chairman of the board and part-owner of SunFirst Bank The prosecutors are seeking jail sentences for the indicted executives and $3 billion from the poker companies. When the U.S. Department of Justice pursued Party Poker in 2006, it led to a $300 million plea agreement by PartyGaming co-founder Anurag Dikshit and a $105 million settlement with the company itself in 2009. In the criminal case, \\"The maximum penalty for violation of the UIGEA and operating a gambling business is 5 years in prison and a fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss for each charge, for conspiracy to commit wire fraud is 30 years in prison and a fine of $1 million or twice the gross gain or loss, and for money laundering conspiracy is 20 years in prison and a fine of $500,000 or twice the amount laundered.\\" Government position Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, expressed his view when the indictment was unsealed: > As charged, these defendants concocted an elaborate criminal fraud scheme, > alternately tricking some U.S. banks and effectively bribing others to > assure the continued flow of billions in illegal gambling profits. Moreover, > as we allege, in their zeal to circumvent the gambling laws, the defendants > also engaged in massive money laundering and bank fraud. Foreign firms that > choose to operate in the United States are not free to flout the laws they > don't like simply because they can't bear to be parted from their profits. FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Janice K. Fedarcyk added: > These defendants, knowing full well that their business with U.S. customers > and U.S. banks was illegal, tried to stack the deck. They lied to banks > about the true nature of their business. Then, some of the defendants found > banks willing to flout the law for a fee. The defendants bet the house that > they could continue their scheme, and they lost. In the amended complaint the government alleged that \\"Full Tilt Poker did not maintain funds sufficient to repay all players, and in addition, the company used player funds to pay board members and other owners more than $440 million since April 2007.\\" Furthermore, the amended complaint uses the term ponzi scheme prominently, including in its title. A lawyer for Ferguson has denied the allegations, suggesting that the issues may have been the result of mismanagement not malice. A lawyer for some of the defendants issued a press release stating that the phrase ponzi scheme was inaccurate, unfair and disingenuous and that its use was counterproductive. The parties reached a settlement on July 31, 2012, ending all litigation between the government and the PokerStars/Full Tilt companies. Player response \\"Along with everyone else in the poker world, I'm shocked,\\" said Brandon Adams, a poker professional who has appeared in televised tournaments on NBC and ESPN. \\"The expectation was that there would be warning signs. These sites went from multibillion-dollar enterprises to on the ropes overnight.\\" He added: \\"Some players have literally millions of dollars in their online poker accounts.\\" The Poker Players Alliance called upon poker players affected by the shutdown to contact their Congressional representatives. Poker player and then-current U.S. Congressman Barney Frank, in an interview with The Hill, lamented that the Justice Department is more focused on prosecuting online poker sites than those responsible for the mortgage crisis and financial meltdown. In an editorial in the Washington Post, poker player and former U.S. Senator Alfonse D'Amato, a long-time favorite of industry lobbyists, wrote: \\"This is an attack on Internet poker and American poker players like me. Through these strong-arm tactics, prosecutors think they can ban Internet poker. Instead, they are making millions of Americans victims in an attempt to make online poker illegal without the support of legislators or the public.\\" He called on President Barack Obama to rein in the prosecuting attorneys in the Southern District of New York. International response Antigua and Barbuda officials considered action in the World Trade Organization (WTO) saying that the United States violated global trade law by shutting down Internet gambling sites. Antigua and Barbuda have previously brought suit against the United States successfully with the WTO when it awarded monetary damages for violating international agreements on trade in services by prosecuting the operators of offshore internet gambling sites. Online poker is the second largest industry in Antigua's economy. Mark Mendel, the Caribbean government's legal adviser, told Reuters: \\"I don't think there's another country in the world that puts people in jail for engaging in trade that's lawful under international law. It's as if Antigua would put Americans in jail for selling pineapples.\\" On June 29, the Alderney Gambling Control Commission (AGCC) suspended Full Tilt's license as a result of an investigation that arose after earlier federal indictments in New York, accusing company executives and associates of bank fraud, money laundering and other crimes. The license is suspended pending a July 26 hearing in London. Immediately following the suspension, the companies real money completely ceased operations. The actions by the AGCC mandated the cessation of the following: *Registering new customers *Accepting deposits from existing customers; *Allowing existing customers to withdraw funds that are held in their accounts; and *Permitting customers to participate in any form of poker game play or gambling transaction. Various sources report that this opened the way for Jack Binion to buy Full Tilt and ensure all Full Tilt Poker players get refunded in the process. On June 30, European investors agreed to provide capital to repay Full Tilt Players in exchange for a majority stake in the company. On July 26, the hearing revealed that Full Tilt owed () in overdue licensing fees to the AGCC, which Full Tilt paid within seven days as promised clearing the way for approval of a refinancing deal. The hearing was suspended until no later than September 15 as a result of the revelation. The delay until September 15 offers Full Tilt a chance to complete its negotiated settlement. On September 29, the AGCC stripped Full Tilt of its license. The AGCC's statement said that Full Tilt had misrepresented its financial situation, while Full Tilt said the action would jeopardize its ability to repay its customers. Economic impact Prior to the indictments, the United States accounted for 25 to 40% the poker business for these companies. For PokerStars the International business share was 70 to 75% and for Full Tilt it was 50 to 60%, according to one source. Darren Rovell cites a source that says the three companies had a 95% market share in online poker in the United States. The companies combined for an estimated US$200 million in advertising and marketing in the United States and their withdrawal from the U.S. market left network shows such as Poker After Dark and The Big Game without advertising sponsors. On cable television, ESPN's contract with PokerStars was for $22 million. ESPN withdrew its Pokerstars advertising. On Sunday April 17, ESPN2 cancelled its scheduled broadcast of 2011 North American Poker Tour presented by PokerStars.net. On Game Show Network, prepaid episodes of High Stakes Poker continued to air for several months after the event, but the show was in danger of not returning. The companies accounted for a large proportion of World Series of Poker qualifiers via online satellites. As a result, the 2011 World Series of Poker main event had the highest percentage of foreign players (and lowest percentage of American players) in history with 2,265 foreign players. Wynn Resorts allied with PokerStars on March 25 to seek the legalization of Internet gambling in the U.S., but terminated the accord on April 15. U.S. citizens who play online poker for a living effectively lost their livelihoods due to the DOJ action. Pokernews pointed out a thread on the Two Plus Two forums where the PPA asked players to share their stories. Among the poker networks seen as potential destinations for U.S. Poker players looking for a new online home are Carbon Poker and DoylesRoom. According to Brandon Adams, live poker gambling at casinos might be a short-term beneficiary of the crackdown, but often online and live poker are not competitive but complementary, with players honing their skills in cheap, fast games online before gaining the nerve to play for higher stakes at a casino. According to Time, the opposition to legalized domestic online gambling is depriving the United States economy from a huge potential source of tax revenues. One political action committee that received approximately $300,000 from PokerStars returned the money. On April 26, PokerStars began processing cashouts. On May 4, Blanca Gaming of Antigua, the parent company to UB and Absolute Poker who had already laid off 95% of its employees, decided that it would have to pursue bankruptcy. On May 6, Pokerstars augmented their cashout policies to allow players to cashout frequent player points and pro-rata portions of partially earned VIP rewards bonuses. On May 27, the Department of Justice unfroze an Irish account containing more than one-third of the more than $100 million that was owed to players. The account belonged to Full Tilt and its co-founder, Raymond Bitar. This was one of nine frozen Irish accounts. Full Tilt Poker had failed to uphold its promise to return U.S. Poker players by May 15, following the April 15 events. As a result, Full Tilt Pro Phil Ivey announced he would not be playing the 2011 World Series of Poker and suing Full Tilt. Ivey voluntarily withdrew the suit on June 30.Clark County Courts: Register of Actions Arrests John Campos and Chad Elie were arrested on Black Friday. Campos is part-owner and vice chairman of the board of directors for SunFirst Bank. On Monday, April 18, Campos, of St. George, Utah, appeared in a Utah court, but did not enter a plea. He was released on $25,000 bond, ordered to surrender his passport and to appear in a New York court for his next appearance. Chad Elie, of Las Vegas, made his first court appearance in Manhattan on Tuesday April 19. He was released on $250,000 bail. Bradley Franzen made a court appearance in Manhattan on Monday April 18, entering a plea of 'not guilty' to the nine counts listed on his indictment, including bank fraud and money laundering charges. Franzen's bail was set at $200,000, for which his parents' house was used as collateral. Franzen pleaded guilty in a New York court on May 23, 2011. It is not known when he will be sentenced; however, it appears that Franzen struck a plea agreement with prosecutors, in which he agreed to cooperate in the probe, in return for which prosecutors would recommend leniency. Most of the other named defendants were out of the country. Ira Rubin, indicted on illegal gambling, fraud, and money laundering charges was arrested on Monday, April 25, 2011, in Guatemala. He made his initial court appearance in Miami on April 27, and was remanded in custody to his next appearance on April 29. Ray Bitar surrendered to authorities on July 2, 2012. Isai Scheinberg surrendered to authorities upon landing in New York on January 17, 2020. Scheinberg surrendered his passports, posted a $1 million bond, and was released with orders to remain in the New York area. He was the last of the 11 original defendants to face his charges in the US. In September 2020, Scheinberg was sentenced to pay a fine of $30,000 with no jail time.CardPlayer.com: Poker Site Operator Gets Slap On The Wrist For Charges Stemming From Black Friday Convictions On December 20, 2011, Absolute Poker co-founder Brent Buckley pleaded guilty to misleading banks. The plea deal calls for him to receive a sentence between a year and a year and a half in prison. Sentencing was set for April 19, 2012. Buckley was sentenced to 14 months. On January 17, 2012, Ira Rubin entered a plea agreement in a Manhattan federal court in front of US Magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein. Rubin agreed to plead guilty to three of the nine counts of conspiracy to commit bank fraud he faced and was expected to be sentenced to 18–24 months of prison. He received a three-year sentence. Judge Kaplan said, \\"You are an unreformed con man and fraudster,\\" and calling his actions a \\"brazen\\" defiance of US law. \\"A significant sentence is necessary to protect the community.\\" John Campos pleaded guilty in March 2012 to a single misdemeanor bank gambling charge. He was sentenced in June to three months in prison. During his plea, Campos said his processing of the gambling proceeds for PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker was not in return for a $10 million investment in the bank.Associated Press: Ex- Utah exec gets 3 months in NY poker case References External links *April 11 press release of Indictment *September 20 press release of amended complaint *Pokerstars U.S. Player FAQ United States District Court for the Southern District of New York cases United States computer case law United States gambling case law Online gambling Poker and society 2011 in United States case law 2011 in poker 2011 in American television 2011 controversies ","title":"United States v.

Activists drew some \\"red lines\\" for the new Ukrainian government (in particular for President, Parliament and executive branch) which it should not cross. In case the government do cross those lines, activists promise it will face an immediate resistance and protests from the civil society. Those \\"red\\" lines are divided into six topics: Ukrainization, European-Atlantic integration, decommunization, Armed Forces, relations with Russia, territorial structure and integrity. Any steps to revert or sabotage Ukrainization, European-Atlantic integration, decommunization or reforms in Armed Forces, to restore good relations with Russia, to rearrange territorial structure or to violate territorial integrity will be considered as crossing the red lines.

It was established in 1887 and merged with the Amalgamated Copper Company in 1901. The Amalgamated Copper Company changed its name to Anaconda Copper in 1910, and became one of America's largest corporations.Frederick, p. 106. Historian Michael P. Malone has written, \\"Well financed and well managed, the Boston and Montana came to rank among the world's greatest copper companies.\\"Malone, 2006, p. 48. Corporate history Adolph and Leonard Lewisohn were German Jews whose father had established in 1858 an American subsidiary, Lewisohn Brothers, which bought and sold bristles, feathers, hair, metals, and wood.Ingham, p. 792-793. In 1867, Adolph and Leonard emigrated to the United States and took over the company, focusing their attention on the trading of copper, lead, and zinc.Ingham, p. 793. In 1879, the brothers were invited to purchase some mines in Arizona, Montana, and Tennessee. With $75,000, they organized the Montana Copper Company, the Tennessee Copper and Chemical Company, and the Miami Copper Company (in Arizona). In 1887, Adolph and Leonard bought Lewisohn Brothers from their father and turned it into an independent company. C. X. Larrabee, who co-founded the Boston and Montana smelting company in the 1890s. The Boston and Montana was organized on July 22, 1887, by the merger of Lewisohn Brothers, the Montana Copper Company, and the mine holdings of C. X. Larrabee (owner of the highly productive and famous Larrabee and Mountain View mines).\\"A Montana Mining Deal.\\" New York Times. July 23, 1887; \\"Death of Leonard Lewisohn.\\" New York Times. March 6, 1902. It quickly became the second-largest company in Montana (only the Anaconda Copper Company in Butte was larger).Whitten and Whitten, p. 127. It owned mines in Arizona, Michigan, Montana, and Tennessee. For many years, it was managed by \\"Captain\\" Thomas Couch, a Cornish immigrant and expert miner. In Montana, the B&M; relied heavily on copper mined from the Leonard and the Colusa mines, near Butte. The company owned a small smelter in Meaderville, a small town just east of Butte (now consumed by the Berkeley Pit mine). Other productive mines (the Badger State, Comanche, Liquidator, Mountain View, Pennsylvania, Wandering Jew, and West Colusa) now added their ores to the stream needing smelting and refining.Malone, 2006, p. 49. The Meaderville smelter was too small, and any smelter would need cheap power and much water. Leonard Lewisohn considered both Helena and Great Falls for his new smelter. The balance was tipped in favor of Great Falls due to several factors. First was the existence of a railroad to Great Falls. James Jerome Hill, primary stockholder and president of the Great Northern Railway had established a subsidiary, the Montana Central Railway, on January 25, 1886.Hidy, Hidy, and Scott, p. 57. Few railroads served Montana at that time. But Butte was a booming mining town that needed to get its metals to market, gold and silver had been discovered near Helena, and coal companies in Canada were eager to get their fuel to Montana's smelters. Hill's close friend and business associate, Paris Gibson, had founded the town of Great Falls on the Great Falls of the Missouri River in 1883, and was promoting it as a site for the development of cheap hydroelectricity and heavy industry.Martin, p. xxi; Malone, 1996, p. 132; Guthrie, p. 20; Taliaferro, p. 120-121. Hill was building the Great Northern across the northern tier of Montana, and it made sense to build a north-south railroad through central Montana to connect Great Falls with Helena and Butte. Surveyors and engineers had begun grading a route between Helena and Great Falls in the winter of 1885–1886 (even before the company had been incorporated), and by the end of 1886 had surveyed a route from Helena to Butte. Construction on the Great Northern's line westward began in late 1886, and on October 16, 1887, the link between Devils Lake, North Dakota; Fort Assinniboine (near the present-day city of Havre); and Great Falls was complete.Hidy, Hidy, and Scott, p. 57-60. Service to Helena began in November 1887, and Butte followed on November 10, 1888.Hidy, Hidy, and Scott, p. 60; \\"St. Paul Minneapolis and Manitoba,\\" Railway News, November 30, 1889, p. 966. The second reason was Hill's own investment in the city of Great Falls. Hill organized the Great Falls Water Power & Townsite Company in 1887,The Montana Almanac, p. 381. with the goal of developing the town of Great Falls; providing it with power, sewage, and water; and attracting commerce and industry to the city.Report of the Bureau of Agriculture Labor and Industry of the State of Montana, p. 223. To attract industry to the new city, he offered low rates on the Montana Central Railway.Strom, p. 151. In case cheap power, plenty of water, and low shipping rates were not enough of an inducement, Hill also gave Leonard Lewisohn 1,500 shares in the Great Falls Water Power & Townsite Company. The Boston and Montana Smelter in Great Falls, Montana, circa 1907. Black Eagle Dam is to the left. On September 12, 1889, the Boston and Montana signed an agreement with Great Falls Water Power & Townsite Company in which the power company agreed to build a dam that would supply the mining firm with at least 1,000 horsepower (or 0.75 MW) of power by September 1, 1890, and 5,000 horsepower (or 3.73 MW) of power by January 1, 1891.Hyde, p. 86.McCormick, p. 3. In exchange, Boston and Montana agreed to build a $300,000 copper smelter near the dam.McCormick, p. 2. Black Eagle Dam began generating electricity in December 1890.Peterson, p. 86. Water was permitted to flow over the crest of the dam on January 6, 1891, and the dam was considered complete on March 15, 1891.Parker, p. 64. Ground was broken on the smelter in the spring of 1890.Hofman, p. 267-269. It was located on a bluff overlooking Black Eagle Dam next to the hamlet of Black Eagle, Montana.

The cost of the original plant was $2 million,Raymer, p. 18. and by 1892 more than 1,000 workers were employed at the smelter.Taliaferro, p. 121. Along with Anaconda Copper, the Butte and Boston Consolidated Mining Company,This company had been formed by the Lewisohn brothers and Albert S. Bigelow, a wealthy copper mine owner from Boston, Massachusetts. It was created in February 1897, and had an interlocking board of directors with the Boston and Montana. See: Malone, p. 48; McNeils, p. 211. and the Montana Ore Purchasing Company, the Boston and Montana was the most powerful mining and refining concern in Montana in the early 1890s.Frederick, p. 103. In 1890, 50 percent of all copper mined in the U.S. came from Montana.Malone, 2006, p. 53. In 1897, Anaconda Copper supplied of copper; Calumet and Hecla (in Michigan) supplied of copper; and the Boston and Montana . In 1899, Henry Huttleston Rogers, a business associate of John D. Rockefeller, proposed the creation of a giant copper company through the consolidation of smaller firms.Punke, p. 61; Morris, p. 162-163; Chernow, p. 378-380. F. Augustus Heinze, owner of Montana Ore, opposed these efforts. After losing several battles in Montana state courts, Rogers and his business associates incorporated in the state of New York and attempted to obtain control of several Montana copper mining and smelting companies. Their goal was to establish diversity of jurisdiction so that any future lawsuits would be heard by federal courts (which Rogers believed would be less considerate of Heinze's interests). Heinze's associates bought stock in the New York company, and then initiated a lawsuit (financed by Heinze) in which they claimed that the reincorporation had been done without shareholder consent. Rogers lost the suit, and was forced to re-reincorporate (a process which took several years). Rogers purchased Anaconda Copper in 1899, then established a new holding company (the Amalgamated Copper Company) to control Anaconda and the other firms Rogers coveted.Frederick, p. 105. By November 1900, Amalgamated had purchased the Colorado Smelter and Mining Company and the Washoe Copper Company, and had a controlling interest in the stock of the Parrott Silver and Copper Mining Company. The following year, Rogers obtained a majority stockholder position in the Boston and Montana and the Butte and Montana companies. Post-consolidation In 1903, the Amalgamated shut down its smelting operations in an attempt to force Heinze to shut down his mines. This would turn Heinze's miners, who idolized their young chief executive officer, against him. Unfortunately, Heinze kept his mining operations open. In 1904, he disobeyed a federal injunction and began mining an underground area whose ownership was in dispute. Heinze was fined $20,000, and held in contempt of court. John D. Ryan, president of the Daly Bank and Trust Co. in Butte and former president of the Anaconda Company,Morris, p. 227; \\"John D. Ryan Dies Unexpectedly.\\" New York Times. February 12, 1933. convinced Heinze to sell out to Amalgamated. Heinze did so in 1906, accepting $10.5 million in compensation and agreeing to end more than 110 lawsuits which had tied up $70 to $100 million worth of Amalgamated property. The B&M;'s site in Great Falls later became known for a record-setting smokestack. On April 7, 1908, construction began on the \\"Big Stack,\\" a chimney for dispersal of fumes high, with an interior measurement of in diameter at the base and in diameter at the top.\\"Great Falls, Montana,\\" p. 351. Built by the Alphonse Custodis Construction Co. of New York, it was completed on October 23, 1908, and was the tallest chimney in the world when finished.Marcosson, p. 289. The former Boston and Montana smelter in Great Falls closed in 1980.Mutschler, p. 14. In 2011, the old B&M; smelter was listed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a Superfund hazardous and toxic waste site.Puckett, Karl. \\"EPA Adds Black Eagle Site to Superfund List.\\" Great Falls Tribune. March 9, 2011. The EPA also said it would begin sampling for the riverbed above and below Black Eagle Dam, as well as residential areas in the town of Black Eagle, for heavy metals contamination. Historic records show that plant wastes were routinely dumped into the Missouri River below Black Eagle dam.Environmental Protection Agency. \\"EPA Adds Anaconda Copper Mining Co.

The Montana Department of Environmental Quality estimated in 2002 that between and of waste were dumped into the river between 1892 and 1915. EPA samples indicated that the contamination could extend as far downstream as Fort Benton, away. Toxins present in the water and riverbed, according to the EPA, include antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, lead, manganese, mercury, nickel, silver, sodium, and zinc.

It is the second promotional single released from their third studio album, A Star- Crossed Wasteland, and first to go for radio adds. The song is a duet with Otherwise vocalist Adrian Patrick. The music video for the song premiered in late September 2010. Song meaning Background Originally, Brink had written the male vocal parts of the song for Five Finger Death Punch frontman Ivan Moody. Due to record business issues, Moody was not able to lend his vocals to the track. Brink explains, \\"They (Five Finger Death Punch) would've had a single coming out at the same time as us, so it prevents problems business wise or whatever. [There] was nothing we could do for it...\\" Producer Kevin Churko instead enlisted Adrian Patrick, who sang on the demo version of the song to appear on the final version. Guitarist Chris Howorth says Patrick's vocals were a perfect match, \\"Adrian had this deep, rich voice. And together with Maria, it was a sound I have never heard before from any band or any duet. It was such a thrill to write such a powerful song and hear it sound so amazing in its rough form.\\" Promotion The music video was directed by David Brodsky and shot around the same time as the first single, \\"The Gun Show\\" in May 2010. The clip premiered on Century Media's YouTube channel in September 22, 2010. To perform the song live, Adrian Patrick has made appearances throughout the summers 2010 Mayhem festival to sing the duet while his band Otherwise opened for In This Moment on a few off festival shows. Patrick continued to sing the duet during the bands co headlining tour with Nonpoint during the fall of 2010. Maria Brink has invited other vocalists from touring bands to fill in Patricks vocals live. For Record Store Day 2011, a limited edition CD single of \\"The Promise\\" was released.

July 1973, p. 18. a process similar to electrogalvanization. In advertising materials, Bethlehem Steel claimed the process was more effective than hot dip galvanization, the most common means of using zinc to protect steel. The process is similar to that of Electrolytic sulfuric acid zinc plating, with few differences from bethanization. The electrolytic sulfuric acid zinc plating process uses zinc anodes, while bethanization uses inert mild steel anodes instead. The electrolytes used are manufactured by using zinc oxide dross, and dissolving it in sulfuric acid. In 1936, Bethlehem Steel spent $30 million (1936 dollars) to build a factory in Johnstown, Pennsylvania capable of creating large amounts of Bethanized wire.Special to the New York Times. \\"Open plant to make new Bethanized wire\\", The New York Times. April 17, 1936. Page 2.  Material Properties  Uniformity - The zinc coating surrounding the wire is tightly bonded to the steel and uniformly distributed; weak spots on the wire will not be found. Ductility - Bethanizing steel with 99.9 percent zinc, bonds them together tightly without any room for layers of zinc iron alloy. Zinc iron alloy is a brittle substance that induces cracking, leaving steel at critical points exposed. The zinc coating is more ductile and less brittle. Resistance to corrosion and fatigue - Bethanized wire is claimed to have protection against corrosion and corrosion fatigue equal to that of hot-galvanized steel wire. Strength - Wire that has been bethanized has breaking strengths claimed to be around 90 percent of bright wire strength.  Use in Fencing  Bethanization was applied to outdoor fencing by the Bethlehem Steel company in the 1930s. Pure zinc was bethanized to ensure that the wire used for fencing had attractive material properties. When coating wire with pure zinc, the wire is no longer contaminated with iron unlike previous processes such as galvanization, which the company claims gives wire more durability while still retaining Ductility. The bethanized fencing is claimed to also be Resistant to Sulfur gases that are present in earths atmosphere. The fence resists these gases more or less depending on the purity of zinc used to bethanize. Other fencing applications that have been bethanized by the Bethlehem Steel Company include: * Barbed wire * Gates * Fence posts * Silver Star bale ties  References  Corrosion prevention Metal plating Zinc ","title":"Bethanization"},{"id":"31526932","text":"Ya'qub ibn Ishaq al-Israili (; died 1208 CE) was a 12th-century Egyptian Jewish physician.

It bills itself as having \\"the third largest per capita public library collection of any major city in America with a collection of more than 2.4 million items—including books, DVDs, music, government documents.\\"About Minneapolis Central Library The building at 300 Nicollet Mall with two levels of underground parking was designed by César Pelli and opened on May 20, 2006. It has over 300 computers for use by the public, an atrium, an green roof planted with low-growing ground cover designed to \\"be sun- and drought-resistant\\", and a host of energy-efficiency measures. A photograph from around 1900 of the first central Minneapolis Public Library, which cost $324,894. The second central Minneapolis Public Library building opened in 1961 as part of urban renewal for downtown Minneapolis The new Central Library under construction in 2004 The atrium of the Central Library History The predecessor of Minneapolis's public library was a subscription library called the Minneapolis Athenæum founded in 1859. The Minneapolis Public Library was founded in 1885 and its first task was to build a main library. The first central library of the \\"Minneapolis Public Library\\" (also known as the main library) was built in 1889 along Tenth Street and Hennepin Avenue about six blocks south of the current building.Benidt, Bruce Weir, The Library Book, Centennial History of the Minneapolis Public Library, 1984, p. 40 The library contained an art gallery primarily of work from the collection of library benefactor T. B. Walker. After many decades the library was considered overcrowded and out of date and plans began for a new library at a different location. The Minneapolis Public Library and Information Center (MPLIC), opened on January 28, 1961 at 4th St. and Nicollet Ave. (the site of the current building). The new four-story glass-and-steel building replaced the old stone castle-like one, which was torn down (the space is now a parking lot). The building included a library, as well as a planetarium, auditorium, and a small museum in its basement which became famous to school children for its Egyptian mummies. The new location in the then run-down \\"lower loop\\" district made the library a \\"cornerstone\\" of the 1960 redevelopment of downtown Minneapolis.Benidt, Bruce Weir, The Library Book, Centennial History of the Minneapolis Public Library, 1984, pp. 169, 172, 173 Thirty years later library and community leaders again began to build support for a new, bigger library. Construction on the third and current library began (on the same location as the demolished second building) after Minneapolis voters approved a $140 million in funding to improve library services on November 7, 2000. The new building was designed by César Pelli, along with the Minneapolis firm Architectural Alliance, and opened to the public on May 20, 2006. At a cost of $250 per square foot, the library features a roof garden and substantial daylight. Its storage area was designed to be available to the public without staff assistance so that nearly all of the collection is accessible to the public. Between the closing of the second library and the opening of the new building, most services were provided at the interim \\"Central Library Marquette\\" location, on two floors in Marquette Plaza (formerly the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis). The cost of providing the interim site while the old library was demolished and rebuilt exceeded $10 million. The Minneapolis Public Library system, which consisted of 14 branch libraries in addition to Central, joined the 26-library Hennepin County Library system on January 1, 2008. The administration for the unified library system remained at Ridgedale Library in Minnetonka. The Minneapolis Planetarium Society was at the second MPLIC building using a projector machine literally older than the space age itself (delivered and installed originally in 1954, three years before the launch of Sputnik I). In 2005, the Minnesota Legislature apportioned funding for the inclusion of a planetarium in the new Central Library building. The Minnesota Planetarium was originally planned for the roof of the new building but was instead added to the plans for the new Bell Museum of Natural History at the University of Minnesota.Minnesota Planetarium official site References External links *Minneapolis Central Library website Hennepin County Library César Pelli buildings Minneapolis Public Library Libraries in Minnesota ","title":"Minneapolis Central Library"},{"id":"31526956","text":"Options of a Trapped Mind is the debut album by Slovenian Thrash metal band Negligence.

It is endemic to Argentina and Bolivia, and thrives as a weedy plant in rocky land, on stream banks, and scrub land between in elevation. It is also known as dwarf tamarillo, due to superficial similarities with Solanum betaceum. Both plants are noted for very rapid growth from seed, and very strongly fragrant foliage. Solanum abutiloides is also sometimes known by the archaic Cyphomandra sibundoyensis. Solanum abutiloides quickly matures into a shrub or small tree up to tall, though usually far smaller. Small flowers form on branches throughout the plant, and individual clusters of flowers can contain as many as 60 blooms. Blooms are followed by fruits - a small oblong berry that ripens to a yellow-orange color. The berries are around (or slightly larger) in diameter. When unripe, the berries are mildly toxic (as are tamarillos), though they are edible upon ripening. Uses The fruits are edible, though Solanum abutiloides is rare in cultivation and plants have not been bred for quality of flavor. Therefore, the fruit can often have an unpredictable or unpleasant flavor, and Solanum abutiloides is most often cultivated as an ornamental plant, as the clusters of ripe fruit are very decorative. As is common with solanaceae, pests like aphids, spider mites, and white flies are attracted to the trees.

Chase (February 4, 1930 – January 5, 2015) was an American businessman and politician who represented the Worcester District in the Massachusetts Senate from 1991–1995. He co-founded the Central Massachusetts Legislative Caucus. In 1991 he designed the Massachusetts Academy of Math and Science at WPI and in 1992 sponsored legislation to create it. He was the Republican nominee for Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1994, but lost in the general election to William F. Galvin.  Early life Chase was born on February 4, 1930 in Worcester, Massachusetts. He graduated from Commerce High School and founded Chase Paper Co. in 1947 and in 1951.Worcester Junior College, Worcester, Massachusetts Chase served in the United States Army from 1952 to 1954. Business career In 1947, Chase and his family founded Chase Paper Company, a stationery company. In 1977, Chase was selected by the U.S. Small Business Administration as the Small Business Person of the Year. That same year he received a certificate from the Harvard Business School Smaller Company Management Program The company was chosen to print the official invitations for the 1981 inauguration of Ronald Reagan. In 1984, Chase sold his interest in Chase Paper Company. In 1989, Chase founded a second stationery company, Checkerboard Ltd. Checkerboard specializes in personalized invitations and stationery. It was one of the first stationery companies to offer the products created with recycled paper. In 1992, Chase convinced his youngest son, Micah Chase, to join the company. He succeeded his father as Checkerboard's CEO in 1994. In 2011, Checkerboard received the Central Massachusetts Family Business Award from the Graduate School of Management at Clark University.  Worcester city government  Chase's career in public service began as a member the advisory board of Quinsigamond Community College. From 1978 to 1981 he was a member of the Worcester School Committee. During his tenure on the School Committee, Chase supported bilingual education and successfully pushed for public transportation in Latino neighborhoods where the children had been forced to take dangerous short cuts to get to school. He is also credited with leading the move to consolidate the Vocational and Public School systems in the City of Worcester. From 1983 to 1989, Chase served as an at-large member of the Worcester City Council. Councilor Chase was a fiscal conservative who led the fights for a water purification and filtration system, streamlining of the city's data processing system, proper handling of hazardous waste, affirmative action, broader representation on city boards and commissions, and cleaning up and improving the inner-city neighborhoods. Massachusetts State Senate Chase represented Boylston, Clinton, Shrewsbury, West Boylston and Wards 1, 2, 3, 4, 9 and 10 of Worcester in the Massachusetts Senate from 1991 to 1995. During this time he served on the Counties (1991–1994), Ways and Means (1991–1994), Health Care (1991–1992), Steering and Policy (1991–1992), Education (1993–1994), Arts and Humanities (1993–1994), Local Affairs (1993–1994), and Public Service Committees (1993–1994). During his tenure in the Senate, Chase co-founded the Central Massachusetts Legislative Caucus. He designed the Massachusetts Academy of Math and Science at WPI then the sponsored legislation to create it, and was a leader in the effort to abolish county governments, reform unemployment insurance laws, and correct flaws in the program that allowed students to attend school in neighboring districts., supported the creation of a commuter rail service between Worcester and Boston Chase was also pro-choice, which put him at odds with some members of his party. In 1991, Senator Chase fought against the way the School Choice bill was being financed, which he felt was a \\"reverse Robin Hood\\" that took money away from poorer communities to finance richer ones. Amendments were later made over the course of the next three years that changed the way that school choice would be funded. As part of the 17-member special commission to study the problem of state-operated hospitals, Chase was instrumental moving mental health patients from old and ill-equipped state hospitals into community-based services that were both more effective and less expensive than institutional care. In addition to improving the conditions for the mental health patients, this was estimated to have saved the Commonwealth of Massachusetts more than $35 million in annual operating costs and another $40 million in capital costs that would otherwise need to be spent to bring antiquated facilities up to the standards of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organization and the Health Care Finance Administration. In 1993, Chase opposed the legislative override of the Governor's veto of the Pacheco anti-privatization bill because he felt that the law \\"serves only to protect the monopoly of a government bureaucracy...\\" When the budget from the Senate Ways and Means Committee appeared to \\"punish\\" State Senator Chase's district for openly challenging the power of the President of the Senate, Billy Bulger, Chase managed to mobilize other key legislators and organization to undo most of the damage. In order to undo the move of the $1.5 million annual operating costs of Clinton's sewage treatment plant from the Massachusetts Water Authority to the local residents despite the agreement from 1897 to provide Clinton with free sewage in return for allowing 40% of the town to be submerged to create the Wachusett Reservoir, Senator Chase worked with Senator Robert A. Antonioni D-Leominster to get that change removed from the budget. The district of Senator Antonioni, who was from the Senate President's political party, included Lancaster which was tied into the Clinton sewage system and would have had to share the financial burden. In order to return a $22 million subsidy for the University of Massachusetts Medical School that is located in Worcester, Chase turned to the Central Massachusetts Legislative Caucus which he had co-founded, and received the support of the Speaker of the House and the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee in order to reinstate the subsidy into the final budget that came out of the Senate–House conference committee. After Senator Chase was unable to get the funding for the Massachusetts Academy of Mathematics and Science that was cut budget returned, managed to undo the damage by convincing Worcester Polytechnic Institute which hosted the academy, to loan the funds until they could be added as an attachment to a future bill. Campaign for Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts In 1994, Chase ran for Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. He was the first Republican candidate to enter the race. His candidacy was poorly received by some members of his party, who circulated buttons that said \\"Anybody But Chase\\" and \\"Another Republican for Augie Grace\\" (a Democratic candidate for Secretary of the Commonwealth). House Minority Leader Peter Forman later entered the race and defeated Chase at the state party convention 66% to 34%. However, because Chase received more than 15% of the vote, he earned a spot on the primary ballot. Chase defeated Forman in the primary by 753 votes, but lost to William F. Galvin in the general election 55% to 41%. Later campaigns After leaving the Senate, Chase continued to campaign to end county government and is credited with getting rid of the excesses of County Government. In 1995, Chase was named Massachusetts chairman of Arlen Specter's presidential campaign. In 1996, Chase ran for Treasurer of Worcester County, Massachusetts. He lost to incumbent Michael J. Donoughue 57% to 43%. Republican party Arthur E. Chase was a businessman whose political positions sometimes put him at odds with his Republican colleagues. He was considered a very pragmatic politician who was not afraid to take unpopular positions and who was highly respected by Democrats and Republicans alike. As a state senator from the minority party, he worked with Democratic legislators to create the Central Massachusetts Legislative Caucus, which was organized around issues related to Central Massachusetts. In 1988, Arthur Chase was a delegate to Republican National Convention from Massachusetts.  Civic leadership  Arthur Chase set an example as a leader willing to make changes at the expense of popularity. In 1992, he supported the use of less expensive flag men at construction site instead of paid policemen at construction site, thereby risking the votes policemen in his district. At meetings to prevent the siting of a group home for mentally handicapped adolescents in a neighborhood in his district, Chase openly opposed efforts to ban group homes within 1000 feet of a school on the grounds that it would effectively keep such homes out of the city of Worcester altogether. Chase regularly served as an emergency foster parent for abused, neglected and runaway adolescents through Y.O.U. Inc.  Community theater  Starting with a lead role as the Mikado in 1947, Arthur was an active member of the Worcester County Light Opera Club (WCLOC) Theater Company. He served as WCLOC President for the 1954–1955 season. In the 21st season he played Mayor Shinn in Music Man. Naples, Florida Arthur moved to Naples, Florida with his wife Elaine in 2004, and soon after, was on the board of directors for the Heron in Pelican Bay. While in Naples and on the board of directors, Chase worked to preserve the Clam Pass and its mangrove forest. He also supported Conservancy of Southwest Florida, the Naples Council on World Affairs, the Naples Botanical Gardens, the Neighborhood Health Clinic, Planned Parenthood of Collier County, the local Holocaust Museum and the Mangrove Action Group.

Pacific Rim Children's Choir Festival For seven years, Martin has also served as Artistic Assistant/Pianist for the Pacific Rim Children's Choir Festival in Honolulu, Hawaii. International performances and 2010 tour Ellis has performed at Westminster Abbey in London and toured much of Canada and Europe, including playing an organ concert on the Tambourini organ at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome during tours with the ICC. Most recently, Ellis toured Australia in November 2010, performing for the Organ Society of Western Australia on the Karrinyup Wurlitzer Organ in the Sterling Theatre Concert Season. Ellis was interviewed by John Crook of ATW Travel Radio Australia during his tour. Another highlight of the tour was the Pops on Pipes concert in Auckland, New Zealand. Trio con Brio With extraordinary sight- reading skills and the ability to musically adapt to a variety of situations, Martin was invited to be the fourth member of Trio con Brio by Donna Parker, Jonas Nordwall and Tom Hazleton. TCB uses three separate organs played simultaneously for grand orchestral effects and interesting concert programs. He performed for the Dickinson Theatre Organ Society and Fort Wayne's Embassy Theatre when Hazleton was unable to perform, and was ready to step in and play any of the other member's parts as the understudy. He became the third permanent member upon Hazleton's passing. Ellis is featured on three CDs from the group. Review In a 2007 issue of the Vox Humana newsletter, from the Incorporated Society of Organ Builders, Mark Dresden writes about a recent Trio con Brio concert: \\"The players are excellent musicians, well versed in their knowledge of the theater organ in general and of the Dickinson Kimball in particular. They are also well versed in the art of playing together with creative, original and exciting arrangements. It was also exciting to see and hear for the first time the two Dickinson consoles on stage. But there was more. Also on stage with the Dickinson consoles were two grand pianos and a third organ which was an Allen Organ. All in all, it was a visually exciting prelude to that which was about to follow. Whether playing together as the Trio or playing individually, their music was clean, crisp and imaginative. As a trio however, we were treated to sounds that were quite special. Six hands, thirty fingers and six feet can and did produce wonderful arrangements just not possible by a single organist.\\" Recordings Mr. Ellis has a solo CD, Martin on the Morton, featuring the Wheaton Fox Studio 4/26 Robert Morton Pipe Organ, and In the Key of Three, the Trio's most recent recording. Other TCB CDs with Ellis include Tales from the Chambers, and A Change of Seasons.. Ellis is featured on the Reynolds Associates Pipe Organ Builders, Inc. website, playing music on two different Reynolds organs. A solo theatre organ CD was recorded in Spring 2011, and the next Trio Con Brio recording using the 5 manual 108 rank Midmer-Losh organ at the Adrian Phillips Music Studio in Phoenix, Arizona. Organ Innovation Ellis, Parker and Nordwall worked for Rodgers Instrument Corporation, spearheading MIDI implementation with church music. Arranger Ellis has many published choral and orchestra arrangements with Hal Leonard and Colla Voce publishing companies. He recently orchestrated 15 pieces that were performed and recorded with the Moscow Chamber Orchestra and ICC. Novello and Co. Ltd published Ellis' arrangement of three organ pieces by Samuel Wesley. In 2012, his arrangement of The Star Spangled Banner was performed by Kelly Clarkson, the Indianapolis Children's Choir and percussion for Super Bowl XLVI at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. Ellis customized handbell music to benefit from the expanded octaves including chimes available at NUMC. Handbell ringers coined the term 'martinizing' to define Ellis' ability.Donald Stikeleather, personal communication, April 17, 2011. Editor Ellis selected and edited works for By Babylon's Streams, Organ Music of the English Romantic School. The book description from Boosey: \\"This music book presents some of the finest & most ambitious works written by English organ composers active between the late-Victorian period & the years following the First World War. Its contents include the Scherzoso of Walter Battison Haynes, the Nunc Dimittis of Charles Wood, the Fantasy on the Tune 'Babylon's Streams by William Harris, the Impromptu No. 2 by Sidney Nicholson, and the Lament.\\" Teacher Ellis taught privately in Indianapolis while working there. He was a featured instructor at the ATOS Summer Youth Camp in Eastern Massachusetts in June 2011, which provided young enthusiasts the opportunity to study and learn the art of the theatre pipe organ through lectures, master classes, and private instruction. Ellis currently works with Gresham High School (Oregon)'s Theatre Arts Department, accompanying their musical performances and student's competition pieces. Awards After becoming the first winner of the ATOS Young Organists Competition in 1986, Ellis premiered with Rex Koury at the Chicago Theatre Wurlitzer and was featured in concert at the ATOS National Convention the following year in Richmond, Virginia.

The film was directed by Paula van der Oest and premiered in the Netherlands on February 6 before being released on 31 March 2011. Plot Ingrid and Anna Jonker live in a seaside shack with their elderly grandmother. One night, Anna rushes into the bedroom and tells Ingrid that their grandmother is not breathing. As her body is carried away in a hearse, the wealthy Abraham Jonker (Rutger Hauer) arrives and expresses shock that the girls have no shoes. When Anna asks what they are to call him, Abraham replies, \\"Call me 'Pa.'\\" Decades later, in 1960, an adult Ingrid (Carice van Houten) is swimming in the ocean when she starts to go under. Hearing her cries, a man on shore (Liam Cunningham) dives into the water to save her. They reach the shore, and he introduces himself as novelist Jack Cope. Overjoyed, Ingrid says she has read his novel. Jack asks how she liked it. She replies that his novel saved her life. Jack is stunned to hear that she is \\"the poet Ingrid Jonker.\\" Her sister Anna interrupts to say their father is waiting for her. Abraham tells Ingrid that her estranged husband, Pieter, asked for a ride to her house. Ingrid says that she and Pieter have nothing in common. In the home Ingrid and her infant daughter share with Anna, Pieter pleads for another chance. Jack calls to invite Ingrid to a party with his friends. Ingrid refuses Pieter and goes to the party. There, a black writer says that the Censorship Board has banned his unpublished novel and the police have confiscated the manuscript. He laments four years of his life gone to waste. Jack and Ingrid drive the writer to the black township of Nyanga. On the way, they are stopped by a white cop, who tries to give the writer trouble. The writer tells Jack that Ingrid's father is the head of the Censorship Board and the man who banned his novel. Jack says Ingrid isn't like her father. Jack and Ingrid go to his flat, where he tells her he has two children and is going through an ugly divorce. Ingrid shows him a poem she wrote in his honor, and Jack is moved. He asks why she wrote it, and she says his novel saved her life. They become lovers. Later, Jack tells her he is madly in love with her and asks her and her daughter to move in with him. She accepts. However, Jack refuses to marry her. He eventually says he is unable to write and says being with her \\"drains him,\\" although Ingrid continues to write. He decides to visit his sons and their mother for two or three months. Ingrid is distraught at the idea of being apart for so long and begs him not to go. She quits her job to see him off at the train station, where she asks him to stay or take her with him. Jack leaves. Ingrid is shown having a private abortion. Jack calls to tell Ingrid that he will be away for another month. Angered, she seduces a writer named Eugene Maritz (the real-life André Brink). Eugene is a fan of Ingrid's poetry, and playwright Uys Krige lauds him as a new literary talent. Jack returns to find a pair of Eugene's shoes in his closet and kicks Ingrid out. Ingrid and Jack witness the police shoot at a car, killing a black child. The horror of this and the apartheid motivates Ingrid to write her most famous poem, \\"Die Kind.\\" Ingrid's father supports the Apartheid as the Chair of the parliamentary select committee responsible for censorship laws on art, publishing, and entertainment. He is a tyrannical man who never shows Ingrid affection and is embarrassed by her opposition to his political views, her support of writers whose work he censors, and her own writing. When she asks him to read a new poem of hers, he reads only part of it and rips it up. Ingrid's interpersonal issues with her father, Jack, and Eugene lead to her depression. She is committed to Valkenberg Psychiatric Hospital, where Jack visits her and learns about her previous pregnancy. He asks why she did not tell him. She says he would have married her only for that reason. Ingrid tells him the hospital took all her poems, but she still has them in her head. Jack finds a pocketbook full of poems in the box of her belongings. He and Uys find them good and feverishly work to compile them into a book. After Ingrid is released, the book is accepted by a publisher. She dedicates the book to Jack and Uys. The book is well reviewed and nominated for the prestigious APB Award. Ingrid is able to go to Europe for the first time. Before leaving, she visits her father at work to give him the news and ask him to accompany her. Her father tells her he wanted to ban her book and only did not do so because his colleagues said it would cause a scandal. He says he never wants to see her again. Ingrid asks Jack to accompany her to Europe, but he says the government would not issue him a passport because of his political views. She invites Eugene, and he accepts. During the trip, he finds her writing a poem about her love for Jack and is furious. He tells her he is returning to South Africa early. Ingrid performs an abortion on herself and is hospitalized. The hospital calls her father to ask for permission to conduct electroconvulsive shock therapy. He gives his permission. Ingrid is no longer able to write and no longer smiles. She goes to Jack's home one night and gives him her AFB medal along with a poem about her love for him. She takes her life by walking into the ocean. Later, Jack is shown watching from a distance her body being recovered. The film ends with a recording of Nelson Mandela's reading of Ingrid's poem in his address to the first democratically elected parliament.

She became known as \\"The Essence of Eccentricity\\". She dressed in ultra-tight skirts — so tight in fact, that she would lie down on the stage and shuffle back and forth on her back to pick up whatever she had contrived to drop. Her hat sported a lone daisy, feather, or fish bone, and once even a lit candle — supposedly, so she could see where she was going and where she had been. Biography Wallace was born in Glasgow in 1870 as Eleanor Jane Wallis Tayler. Her father, Francis George Tayler, was a vocalist and musician and her mother a retired actress who became a teacher and governess. Her first solo performance on the stage was as a clog dancer at the age of 12 in Birmingham. Prior to this, she had performed with her sisters Emma and Fanny, also singers and dancers. She had a rapid rise to fame and became much loved by her audiences. Not a naturally pretty woman, a reviewer noted her 'grotesque get-up', which started the audience laughing the moment she appeared on stage; her cleverness, vivacity and facial expressions were second to none. Wallace's London debut came in 1903, and by 1910 she was given billing at the London Palladium. In 1930 she played the part of Widow Twankey at the Dominion Theatre a rare exception to a comic role normally played by men. Her career lasted until her death in 1948; she appeared in the Royal Command Performance of that year. Her main character was a frustrated spinster, singing ribald songs such as \\"Under the Bed,\\" \\"Let's Have a Tiddley at the Milk Bar\\" and \\"Mother's Pie Crust.\\" Other well-known songs in her repertoire included: \\"Meet Me,\\" \\"The Sniff Song,\\" \\"Three Cheers for the Red White & Blue,\\" \\"Half Past Nine,\\" \\"Geranium,\\" \\"Tally Ho!,\\" \\"The Blasted Oak,\\" \\"Three Times a Day\\" and \\"Bang! Bang! Bang!\\" Her appearance made her unusually successful as a pantomime dame -- a role usually performed by men. She usually wore a fur stole, which she described as her \\"little bit of vermin\\". Wallace appeared in a \\"short\\", filmed in 1902, entitled: A Lady's First lesson On A Bicycle. She later moved into bigger budget productions and appeared in The Golden Pippin Girl (1920); The Wishbone (1933); Radio Parade of 1935 (1934), alongside fellow music hall performer Lily Morris and established actor Will Hay; Variety (1935) and Boys Will Be Girls (1936). Nellie Wallace died in a London nursing home on 24 November 1948, aged 78, after a serious bout of bronchitis.

Col. George Crook had recently arrived to assume command of the District of Boise in November, 1866. Crook set out with one company from the 1st U.S. Cavalry on December 18. Bad weather, rough terrain, growing opposition from his own ranks and unreliable guides all plagued Crook from the start. Yet, Crook pushed on until he reached the Paiute camp of Chief Howluck (Bigfoot) along the Owyhee River in southeast Oregon.Michno 2007, p.194 Battle On the morning of December 26, Crook's men caught the Paiutes asleep in their camp.Michno 2003, p.211 However, after the first shots were fired, Chief Howluck determined to stay and fight. The native warriors taunted the soldiers, who returned a deadly accurate fire on the warriors. Quickly into the fighting almost every mounted warrior was shot down. The rest sought refuge behind rocks, remaining there until mid-day when they retreated.Michno 2007, p.194 Aftermath Crook had caused considerable damage to Howluck's warriors. 30 were killed and another 7 captured.

Plot summary Oswald is spending some time in a house with a girl beagle and a boy beagle. The girl beagle plays the piano while Oswald dances on top of it and sings the song It Ain't Gonna Rain No Mo'. Taking the idea too literally, the boy beagle throws a set of umbrellas out the window, much to Oswald's annoyance. They then notice water dripping from the ceiling pipe of a nearby room. To check the problem, the boy beagle brings a ladder and Oswald climbs. Thinking of it more fun to create mischief than to help his friend, however, the boy beagle kicks and knocks down the ladder. Thus Oswald grabs and hangs onto the ceiling pipe which is very brittle. As a result, the pipe breaks, and large quantities of water pour in and flood the house. The girl beagle was frightened by this and therefore takes shelter inside a grandfather clock. After the clock was submerged, she tries to come out but could not because of the enormous pressure exerted by the flood. Oswald then comes and tries to bail her out. Enjoying the flooded indoors, the boy beagle rides on a tub and releases four fishes. Upon reaching Oswald who is still trying to free the other beagle still in the clock, he pulls the rabbit's shorts with a fishing rod and tosses a biscuit inside. The fishes aggressively go in, and Oswald is disturbed. Having enough disturbance, Oswald scares the fishes away but a giant marlin didn't take his gesture too kindly. The marlin began wrestling Oswald as well as stinging him with its pointed nose. When the marlin's attack suddenly misses Oswald, its nose strikes a wall instead, causing the big fish to become stuck and incapacitated. Oswald uses this as an opportunity to hit back. Following a few moments, the marlin was able to break loose but without its nose which remained stuck to the wall. Being on the marlin's side, however, the treacherous boy beagle gives the big fish a saw. In an attempt to put Oswald in much bigger trouble, the marlin saws a hole in the floor which starts to drain the water and anything nearby. This move, however, backfires as the marlin and the boy beagle are pulled into the opening. Oswald is able to keep himself in place until all the water disappears. The girl beagle finally comes out of the clock and embraces her boyfriend. The same song from the beginning plays as Oswald looks down on the first floor. The first floor was completely flooded while the boy beagle in a big wooden bucket swivels from side to side, singing the song. To ignore the beagle, Oswald pours down a big bucket of water and the bucket itself, and knocks down the boy beagle down into the water. Oswald and the girl beagle laughed at what the boy beagle did as the cartoon ends. Characters Oswald's two beagle pals make one of their best known appearances in this cartoon. The girl beagle serves as Oswald's third girlfriend, replacing the girl cat and the live stuffed doll respectively. Her typical outfit consists of a coif, coat, trousers, and high heeled pumps. Coincidentally, another female canine resembling her also appears in the Pooch the Pup cartoons but wearing different clothing. The boy beagle plays a role as the series' trouble maker. He is smaller than the girl beagle, and his garment is a very long shirt that covers all the way to his ankles.

Life Ibn al-Quff, also known as \\"al-Malikī al-Masīḥī\\" (The Melkite Christian), was born in the city of Al Karak (in modern-day Jordan). His father was Muwaffaq al-Dīn Yaʿqūb and was a Melkite Christian Arab. His father had a good job opportunity and moved his family to Sarkhad in Syria, where Ibn al-Quff was tutored by Ibn Abi Uṣaybiʿah who introduced him to the medical studies. He studied with Ibn Abi Uṣaybiʿah and learned a lot of medical information, read many biographies on earlier doctors, and spent a large amount of time meditating on the material he studied and learned. Ibn al-Quff ended up moving to Damascus where he improved his knowledge and studied metaphysics, philosophy, medicine, natural sciences, and mathematics. It is not completely clear as to who was teaching him all of this material but regardless he learned a large amount of information which would be very beneficial for his career. After he had studied for a while and proved he was a good knowledgeable physician and surgeon he was given the job of physician-surgeon in the army which was stationed in Jordan.Ibn Al-Quff, Amīn Al-Dawlah Abū Al-Faraj Ibn Muwaffaq Al- Dīn Ya‘Qūb Ibn Isḥāq Al-Masīhī Al-Karakī.

It was while serving in the army where he really became well known as a physician and a surgeon. His reputation became widespread in the Muslim empire for being a Christian Arab and actually caring for his patients and conducting his work with honesty.The Physician, Therapist and Surgeon, Ibn al- Quff. An Introductory Survey of his Time, Life and Works by Sami K. Hamarneh Review by: Albert T. Awad Pharmacy in History, Vol. 17, No. 2 (1975), pp. 77-78 After his time of popularity died down he was sent to Damascus and remained there teaching until his death at the age of fifty-two. Works During his time in Jordan being a physician-surgeon Ibn al-Quff was writing many books and teaching people. He was actually more well known as a writer and educator on medical topics than being a doctor. He wrote at least ten commentaries and books during his lifetime. Seven of these works are known to exist today whether fragments or the entire work. One of his allegedly most famous works was a commentary on Ishārāt of Ibn Sīnā but there is no evidence of this today, it is assumed to have gone missing or Ibn al-Quff never finished it and produced it. Some of his most well known surviving works are listed below with a brief description. * Kitāb al-ʻUmda fi 'l-ǧirāḥa (كتاب العمدة في الجراحة) or Basics in the Art of Surgery: a general medical manual covering anatomy and drugs therapy as well as surgical care, concentrating on wounds and tumors, however he excluded ophthalmology as he considered it to be a specialty with its own technical literature. The work was published in Hyderabad, India in 1937. This was by far the largest Arabic text on surgery during the entire medieval period. In this book Ibn al-Quff explained the connections between arteries and veins which was the earliest description of what would be known as capillaries. He did this work before the invention of a microscope and also explained how valves worked and the direction they opened and closed. * Al-Shafi al-Tibb (The Comprehensive of the Healing Arts): His first medical encyclopedia, completed early 1272 AD. * Jāmiʻ al-gharaḍ fī ḥifẓ al-ṣiḥḥah wa-dafʻ al-maraḍ (جامع الغرض في حفظ الصحة ودفع المرض): on preventive medicine and the preservation of health in 60 chapters, completed around 1275 AD.

It follows four FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) teams through the course of the 2009 season. Its main subject, however, is Team 1717 and the exploits of its students and its head mentor Amir Abo-Shaeer; the other teams followed were teams 217, 395, and 67, from Sterling Heights, Michigan, New York City, and Milford, Michigan respectively. Summary The book begins with a prologue set at the 2009 FIRST Championship in Atlanta and describes the exciting environment there. It then switches back to the kickoff event in January 2009 and describes Dean Kamen and how he founded FIRST. Afterwards, it details the history of team 1717 and the program that it is a part of, the Dos Pueblos Engineering Academy. Then the book describes how the 2009 team winds its way through a 6-week build season, enduring many struggles from mechanical failures to a bout of sickness. A chapter is dedicated to team 217, the Thunderchickens, who attempt to construct a robot with military style precision, and to team 395, 2TrainRobotics, whose students must deal with issues related to being in the poor inner city, as well as to team 67, Heroes of Tomorrow. After the build season, team 1717 competes in two regional competitions, Los Angeles and Sacramento. The team loses in the finals at Los Angeles, and wins in Sacramento after going undefeated. 1717 then competes in the FIRST Championship, where it loses to a heavily favored team, 111 WildStang, in the division finals.

Meier uses her experiences as the founding principal of the Mission Hill School in Boston, and previous experiences leading the Central Park East schools in New York, to illustrate her vision for school reform in America. The book is broken down into three sections that focus first on the importance of building trust among the various constituencies in schools, then the challenge or threat that high-stakes standardized testing presents to building trust in schools, and finally, a broader vision for how particular systemic and policy changes could be made to increase the likelihood that schools build the trust that is necessary for schools to be effective.  Summary  In the first section, she argues that the main failing of today's public schools is that students do not develop relationships with their teachers. She says that because the school system encourages a separation between a students' school life and their outside life, teachers are missing out on teaching to students' interests. Her main thesis in this section is that teachers need to focus on teaching to students' interests to help engage them in learning which, in turn, will lower drop out rates. Next, she emphasizes the need for parents to be present in their children's schools. She argues that because parents are rarely invited into schools it makes it difficult to place their trust in the school.Brown, Bonnie. \\"In Schools We Trust: Book Review\\". Educational Technology & Society, 2002, p. 3. Her hope is that if teachers and parents can join together in teaching their child that it will be much more effective. She also recognizes the inherent flaws in the educational system saying \\"We are-in short-perhaps the only civilization in history that organizes its youth so that the nearer they get to being adults the less and less likely they are to know any adults\\" Meier, Deborah. \\"In Schools We Trust: Creating Communities of Learning in an Era of Testing and Standardization.\\" Beacon, 2002. p. 13 Through her schools she has tried to reverse this trend and allow older students to have more personal relationships with adults and has found that these students are more likely to succeed. She then moves into a discussion of the history of standardized tests and her experiences with them through her own teaching. She explains that because of the high anxiety that comes with state standardized testing certain ethnic communities are put at a large disadvantage. She states that lower income students are set up to fail and thus closes their window of opportunity.Brown, Bonnie. \\"In Schools We Trust: Book Review\\". Educational Technology & Society, 2002, p. 3. She argues that if the test culture continues, tests will become the only factor of success and inspiration will become vastly undervalued. The final section is her responding to the criticisms of her ideas and restating her main points. She states that each student is different and each community is different and argues that national and state politicians are not the right people to be designing curriculum. She argues that large public schools can be broken down into many small communities, which will improve overall performance. She also hopes that standardized tests are given less weight in the future since, she believes, they do not give a complete picture of each student. She closes with an answer to her main question: \\"For me the most important answer to the question 'why save public education?' is this: It is in schools that we learn the art of living together as citizens, and it is in public schools that we are obliged to defend the idea of a public, not only a private, interest.\\" Meier, Deborah. In Schools We Trust: Creating Communities of Learning in an Era of Testing and Standardization.\\" Beacon, 2002. p. 176  Reception  This book has been celebrated in the education community since its release in 2002. In one review, Bonnie Brown states that Deborah Meier is \\"a legendary school founder and reformer\\" Brown, Bonnie. \\"In Schools We Trust: Book Review\\". Educational Technology & Society, 2002, p. 5. and states that this book is \\"a well-written book that acknowledges the trouble and turmoil our public schools are facing with standardized testing\\" Brown, Bonnie. \\"In Schools We Trust: Book Review\\". Educational Technology & Society, 2002, p. 5. Brown continues to praise the book and even argues that \\"If other educators read this beautifully written book with an open mind, and put her concepts into practice, it can possibly revolutionize the current state of our public school system.\\" Brown, Bonnie. \\"In Schools We Trust: Book Review\\". Educational Technology & Society, 2002, p. 5. In another review, Milly Marmur writes that she sees the book making a strong impact. She believes it has ideas that are useful to the wider educational community and may even be able to influence the political community to create the change she hopes for.Marmur, Milly. \\"In Schools We Trust.\\" Publishers Weekly, 2002, p. 2. Nicholas Meier also reviewed this book in April 2005 and was also impressed with the issues that were discussed. Overall, he feels that \\"Meier's writing style is engaging\\" Meier, Nicholas. \\"In Schools We Trust Review\\". 2005, p. 6. and states that throughout the book she presents the deepest and most profound questions that the American school system faces and presents reasonable solutions that have been shown to succeed.

The temple was the central building on Tàber Hill, currently in Carrer del Paradís number 10, in the city's so-called Gothic Quarter. The dedication to Augustus is traditional, but unproven. Archaeology If still in use by the 4th-century, the temple would have been closed during the persecution of pagans under the Christian emperors. At some point the temple was demolished, and its ruins were not discovered until the late 19th century, when three of its columns appeared on the construction site of Centre Excursionista de Catalunya.Pobles de Catalunya.cat retrieved on April 18 2011 A fourth column was then exhibited at the Plaça del Rei and was later added to the structure, as it can be seen nowadays. According to Josep Puig i Cadafalch, architect Antoni Celles wrote once a complete description and a map of the temple during excavations as early as 1830 financed by the Barcelona Chamber of Commerce. Puig i Cadafalch confirmed Celles's hypothesis that the temple would have been dedicated to Augustus. He also describes it formally as being a peripteral temple with eleven columns on each wing, including corner columns, and with six on the front and further six on the posticum. The whole building would have been 35 x 17.5 metres in size,http://www.emdn.cat/professors/josepm/barcino.doc erected on a podium a third the height of the columns.Puig i Cadafalch, J.; de Falguera, A.; Goday, J..

In particular, scholars have argued that the play is far more thematically complex than has traditionally been thought, and features profound insights into ancient Rome, Elizabethan society, and the human condition. Such scholars tend to argue that these previously unacknowledged insights have only become apparent during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries as only now has the ultraviolent content of the play achieved a sense of relevance. For example, in his 1987 edition of the play for the Contemporary Shakespeare series, A.L. Rowse writes; \\"in the civilised Victorian age the play could not be performed because it could not be believed. Such is the horror of our own age, with the appalling barbarities of prison camps and resistance movements paralleling the torture and mutilation and feeding on human flesh of the play, that it has ceased to be improbable.\\"A.L. Rowse, Titus Andronicus; Contemporary Shakespeare Series (Maryland: University of America Press, 1987), 15 Similarly, director Julie Taymor, who staged a production Off-Broadway in 1994 and directed a film version in 1999, says she was drawn to the play because she found it to be the most \\"relevant of Shakespeare's plays for the modern era;\\"Julie Taymor, DVD Commentary for Titus; 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, 2000 She feels that the play has more relevance for us than it had for the Victorians; \\"it seems like a play written for today, it reeks of now.\\"Charlie Rose interview; 19 January 2000 Because of this new found relevance, previously unrecognised thematic strands have thus come to the forefront. This article presents an overview of four of the most prominent themes in the play. Revenge Titus exacts his revenge for the rape of Lavinia by killing Chiron and Demetrius and draining their blood; illustration from The Works of Mr. William Shakespeare, edited by Nicholas Rowe (1709) Perhaps the most obvious theme is that of revenge. The story of Procne and Philomela is mentioned several times, and just as they are driven by a desire for revenge, so too are the characters in Titus; the entire narrative from midway through Act 1 is built around the plotting of revenge. According to Hereward Thimbleby Price, Shakespeare \\"is writing a Senecan play according to the rules, that is to say, a play in which the hero is a man who inexorably pursues revenge and who dies in the act of taking it.\\"Price (1943: 62) Bill Alexander, who directed a Royal Shakespeare Company production in 2003, argues that > the play is largely about revenge and the desire to take revenge. I think > that everyone understands on some level that revenge is something you might > feel from time to time. The play asks the question \\"At what point is it > right for an individual to take revenge because there is no other way of > redressing wrongs?\\" One of the great things about Shakespeare is that he > never attempts to answer such questions, he simply poses them. Titus > Andronicus poses the question of revenge, so it can't not be relevant. > Everyone has an opinion about when revenge becomes justified and whether the > nature of being civilised and human demands that something like revenge is > excluded, or must be excluded, from the imagination ... In a sense the play > is there to evoke our humanity and our sense of pity about what human beings > can do to each other and about what revenge does to human souls. Revenge can > drive people mad, and madness can drive people to revenge.\\" The theme of revenge is introduced very early in the play. In the opening scene, we learn that some of Titus' sons have been killed during the war with the Goths, and as a result, Titus feels compelled to sacrifice Tamora's son, Alarbus. Here revenge takes on a religious duty as Titus claims of his dead sons, \\"Religiously they ask a sacrifice\\" (l.124). The sacrifice of Alarbus, however, prompts a desire for revenge in his family. As Demetrius tells Tamora immediately after the sacrifice; > The selfsame gods that armed the Queen of Troy > With opportunity of sharp revenge > Upon the Thracian tryant in his tent > May favour Tamora, the Queen of Goths > (When Goths were Goths and Tamora was Queen), > To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes. > :::::::1.1.136-141 This ultimately leads to Tamora ordering her sons to rape Lavinia, which in turn leads directly to Titus killing and then cooking Chiron and Demetrius, his eventual murder of both Lavinia and Tamora, his own death at the hands of Saturninus, and Saturninus' death at the hands of Lucius. Revenge runs through the play from beginning to end; Coppélia Kahn argues that the basic trajectory of the plot is \\"Titus' transformation from Roman hero to revenge hero.\\"Kahn (1997: 55) After the sacrifice of Alarbus, when Saturninus has taken Tamora as his bride, she asks him to pardon Titus for what Saturninus sees as dishonourable conduct. Incredulous, Saturninus asks, \\"What, madam, be dishonoured openly,/And basely put it up without revenge\\" (1.1.432–433); any infraction or insult must be reciprocated. Later, Aaron tells Tamora that he too is preoccupied with revenge; \\"Blood and revenge are hammering in my head\\" (2.3.39). Ordering her sons to rape Lavinia, Tamora says \\"This vengeance on me had they executed./Revenge it, as you love your mother's life\\" (2.3.114–115). Then, prior to the rape, Tamora responds to Lavinia's pleas for mercy by outlining how important her revenge is, only Lavinia's pain can satiate it; Tamora concerned only with revenge; Samuel Woodforde illustration, engraved by Anker Smith (1793) > Hadst thou in person ne'er offended me, > Even for [Alarbus'] sake am I pitiless. > Remember, boys, I poured forth tears in vain > To save your brother from the sacrifice, > But fierce Andronicus would not relent. > Therefore away with her, and use her as you will; > The worse of her, the better loved of me. > :::::::2.3.161-167 As Chiron and Demetrius drag Lavinia into the forest, Tamora vows \\"Ne'er let my heart know merry cheer indeed/Till all the Andronici be made away\\" (2.3.187–188). Tamora will literally not be happy until she has avenged herself on the whole family. Later in the play, Titus makes a similar avowal. After the deaths of Martius and Quintus, he asks, \\"Which way shall I find Revenge's cave?/For these two heads do seem to speak to me,/And threat me I shall never come to bliss/Till all these mischiefs be returned again\\" (3.1.269–272). As with Tamora, he is here saying that his primary raison d'être has become to seek revenge. Similarly, prior to Lucius' departure to the Goths, he declares; > If Lucius live he will requite your wrongs, > And make proud Saturnine and his empress > Beg at the gates like Tarquin and his queen. > Now will I to the Goths and raise a power, > To be revenged on Rome and Saturnine. > :::::::3.1.295-299 Immediately after Lucius' departure, Titus prepares a meal, but warns Marcus \\"Look you eat no more/Than will preserve just so much strength in us/As will revenge these bitter woes of ours\\" (3.2.1–3). Later, Titus comes to feel that even God has become involved in his desire for revenge; \\"Here display at last/What God will have discovered for revenge\\" (4.1.73). Then, upon the discovery of who raped Lavinia, he declares > And swear with me, as, with the woeful fere > And father of that chaste dishonoured dame, > Lord Junius Brutus sware for Lucrece' rape, > That we will prosecute by good advice, > Mortal revenge upon these traitorous Goths, > And see their blood, or die with this reproach. > :::::::4.1.88-93 Young Lucius also becomes involved in a desire for revenge; > BOY > I say, my lord, that if I were a man, > Their mother's bedchamber should not be safe, > For these base bondmen to the yoke of Rome. > > TITUS > Ah, that's my boy! Thy father had full oft > For his ungrateful country done the like. > > BOY > And, uncle, so will I an if I live. > :::::::4.1.106-111 Later, Marcus urges Publius to \\"Join with the Goths, and with revengeful war/Take wreak on Rome for this ingratitude,/And vengeance on the traitor Saturnine\\" (4.3.32–34). The most obvious manifestation of revenge is when it literally enters the play, with Tamora attempting to dupe the apparently insane Titus; \\"I will encounter with Andronicus,/And say I am Revenge, sent from below/To join with him and right his heinous wrongs\\" (5.2.2–4). She then introduces herself as > I am Revenge, sent from th’infernal kingdom > To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind > By working wreakful vengeance on thy foes. > :::::::5.2.32-35 Titus then instructs Revenge that if she encounter Tamora and her sons \\"I pray thee, do on them some violent death;/They have been violent to me and mine\\" (5.2.108–109). Jonathan Bate sees this scene as especially important in the treatment of revenge. On how Titus manipulates the scene and turns the tables, Bate comments \\"the vehicle of Tamora's revenge against Titus for the death of Alarbus has become the vehicle of Titus' revenge against Tamora for the rape of Lavinia and the deaths of Bassianus, Quintus and Martius.\\" He also finds great significance in the physical entry of Revenge into the play; \\"by representing Revenge as a character's device rather than a 'reality' outside the action, [Shakespeare] suggests that retribution is a matter of human, not divine will.\\"Bate (1995: 22) Violence and the audience One of the main reasons that Titus has traditionally been derided is the amount of on-stage violence. The play is saturated with violence from its opening scene, and violence touches virtually every character; Alarbus is burned alive and has his arms chopped off; Titus stabs his own son to death; Bassianus is murdered and thrown into a pit; Lavinia is brutally raped and has her hands cut off and her tongue cut out; Martius and Quintus are decapitated; a nurse and a midwife are stabbed to death by Aaron; an innocent clown is executed for no apparent reason; Titus kills Chiron and Demetrius and cooks them in a pie, which he then feeds to their mother. Then, in the final scene, in the space of a few lines, Titus kills in succession Lavinia and Tamora, and is then immediately killed by Saturninus, who is in turn immediately killed by Lucius. Aaron is then buried up to his neck and left to starve to death in the open air and Tamora's body is thrown to the wild beasts outside the city. As S. Clark Hulse points out, \\"it has 14 killings, 9 of them on stage, 6 severed members, 1 rape (or 2 or 3 depending on how you count), 1 live burial, 1 case of insanity, and 1 of cannibalism – an average of 5.2 atrocities per act, or one for every 97 lines.\\"Hulse (1979: 107) An example of the violence in the play – Aaron cuts off Titus' hand whilst the already handless Lavinia looks on; Gravelot illustration, engraved by Gerard Van der Gucht (1740) J. Dover Wilson, following John Addington Symonds, defines the play as part of a subgenre called \\"Tragedy of Blood\\", directly influenced by Seneca, and places it alongside such plays as Thomas Sackville and Thomas Norton's Gorboduc, (c.1561), Thomas Hughes' The Misfortunes of Arthur (1588), Thomas Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy (c.1588), Christopher Marlowe's The Jew of Malta (1590), Henry Chettle's The Tragedy of Hoffman (1602) and the anonymous Alphonsus, Emperor of Germany (1654). As such, a common theory as to why the play is so violent is that Shakespeare was trying to outdo his predecessors, who catered to the blood-thirsty tastes of the Elizabethan groundlings (Alan C. Dessen refers to Titus as \\"the most 'Elizabethan' of Shakespeare's plays\\"Dessen (1989: 4)). In Thomas Preston's Cambyses (1569), for example, a character is brutally flagellated on stage, and various props and theatrical effects are used to simulate dismemberment and several instances of decapitation. In Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy, there are several graphic murders, and the protagonist bites out his own tongue. Dover Wilson thus suggests that Shakespeare was giving the audience what it wanted, but by giving it to them in such excessive quantities, he was in effect, mocking them, as he watched them \\"gaping ever wider to swallow more as he tossed them bigger and bigger gobbets of sob-stuff and raw beef-stake.\\"Dover Wilson (1948: lvii) However, many twentieth century critics, working with new research into Elizabethan culture, have suggested that the society may not have been as blood-thirsty as is often assumed, and as such, Shakespeare could not have been catering to the audience's predilections for violence. According to Ann Jennalie Cook for example, not all of Shakespeare's audience would have been groundlings, the intelligentsia would also have made up an important part of the box office; \\"the social and economic realities of Renaissance London decreed an audience more privileged than plebeian.\\"Ann Jennalie Cook, The Privileged Playgoers of Shakespeare's London (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1981), 271 With this in mind then, Eugene M. Waith makes the suggestion that Shakespeare was attempting to appeal to both levels of his audience, groundlings and intelligentsia; he embraced the traditions of violence so as to ensure high box office, but the style of the play and the numerous classical allusions suggest he was writing with an educated audience in mind.See Waith (1984: 67) Similarly, Sylvan Barnet argues, \\"Although the groundlings probably were delighted, the author must have felt he was creating a drama that would appeal also to the cultivated, who knew Seneca and Ovid.\\"Barnet (2005: 11) The vast range of mythological and classical references have often been pointed to as evidence of an educated target audience; references include Priam, the Styx, Scythia, Hecuba, Polymnestor, Titan, Phoebe, Hymenaeus, Ajax, Laertes, Odysseus, Olympus, Prometheus, Semiramis, Vulcan, Lucrece, Aeneas, Dido, Venus, Saturn, Philomel, Dian, Acteon, Jove, Pyramus, the Cocytus, Tereus, Cerberus, Orpheus, Tarquin, Cornelia, Apollo, Pallas, Mercury, Hector, Enceladus, Typhon, Alcides, Mars, Astraea, Pluto, Cyclops, Verginia and Sinon. With this in mind, some critics suggest that the violence in the play is much more than violence for violence's sake, and is instead a fundamental part of the thematic whole. For example, Brian Vickers argues that critics commonly express \\"an aesthetico-ethical dislike for the violence\\" because they fail to grasp that \\"any attentive and unprejudiced reading of the play will show that the violence is in no way gratuitous but part of a closely organised depiction of several cycles of harm and counter-harm.\\"Vickers (2002: 150) Similarly, for Waith, the violence \\"represents the political and moral degradation of Rome when Saturninus becomes Emperor of Rome. It also plays a major part in the presentation of the hero's metamorphosis into a cruel revenger. While no artistic device can be called inevitable, one can say with some assurance that Shakespeare's use of violence in Titus Andronicus is far from gratuitous. It is an integral part of his dramatic technique.\\"Waith (1984: 69) Working along the same lines, Jonathan Bate argues that Shakespeare, not content with presenting a play in which violence is a theme, may also have been making his audience wonder about the nature of the violence before them, and thus the play acquires a sense of social critique; \\"Would playgoers have drawn comparisons between the revenger's ritualised violence and the ritualised violence that they were familiar with in real life?\\"Bate (1995: 23) Thus, \\"Shakespeare is interrogating Rome, asking what kind of an example it provides for Elizabethan England.\\"Bate (1995: 17) Trevor Nunn, who directed an RSC production in 1972, sees the play in a similar light, arguing that the violence raises profound questions for an Elizabethan audience; \\"thinking about Rome was the only way an Elizabethan had of thinking about civilisation\\" and as such \\"if Roman power, law and virtue could fail in the end, what absolutes could men look to under heaven?\\" In this sense, the play depicts \\"the Elizabethan nightmare, for even golden ages come to an end in blood, torture and barbarism, and even Rome, the greatest civilisation the world had known, can fall, dragging mankind with it into the darkness.\\"Quoted in Dessen (1989: 35) Another director who has addressed this issue is Gale Edwards, who directed a Shakespeare Theatre Company production in 2007. In her notes, Edwards argues > this is a story, not about gratuitous violence, but about the results and > repercussions of violence on society, on family and on the human psyche. It > is a story about great pain and suffering, which is the inevitable result of > any act of revenge. It deals with our capacity for terrible cruelty and our > vulnerability as human beings. It deals with our nobility, our endurance and > our definition of ourselves. Our very identity. The lopping off of limbs, in > this reading of the play, becomes a powerful metaphor for the dismembership > of the state, the destruction of our moral codes and the disintegration of > our very humanity. Similarly, Peter Brook, when explaining why he thought his 1955 RSC production had been so successful, argues that the play is \\"about the most modern of emotions – about violence, hatred, cruelty, pain.\\"Quoted in Dessen (1989: 15) Breakdown of political order Another prominent theme in the play is political order, both its collapse and the desire to create a new order. Jacques Berthoud argues that one of the main ideas of the play is \\"an impression of disintegrating control.\\"Massai (2001: xlviii) Oftentimes, political order is supplanted by total chaos, and the characters can only yearn for a time when order will again reign supreme. As Eugene M. Waith argues of the highly formal nature of the opening scene, \\"the ceremonies of triumph, sacrifice, burial and election immediately establish the solemnity of public occasions on which an ideal political order is affirmed and individuals are valued to the extent that they support it. The repeated interruptions of the ceremonies suggest the fragility of that order while the mention of Titus' dead sons and the deaths of Alarbus and Mutius emphasise the terrible cost of maintaining it.\\"Waith (1984: 59) The political order that so many characters yearn for and would die to protect is presented as far from stable. The demise of order is represented by Titus himself; the once proud general who stood for everything that was good and honourable in Rome, but is now a madman lying on the road and preaching to the dirt (3.1.23–47); > Titus, noble, patriotic, but flawed by cruelty and an abysmal lack of > political judgement, is a mirror of Rome in decline. He, too, has spent his > life in repelling barbarism, but now his weariness, old age, and lack of > mental agility in coming to terms with new problems, reflect the lack of > real energy and capacity of Rome in dealing with the various crises that > beset it in its declining years. His subscription to the unhistorical > cruelty of making sacrifice of prisoners in the city streets is a symptom of > the coarsening of Roman life and values. In the figure of Rome's \\"best > champion,\\" therefore, we see Shakespeare's initial exploration in > microcosmic form of the painful and tragic collapse of a great > civilization.Taylor (1997: 147) The breakdown of order is also emphasised time and again throughout the play in a more literal sense. For example, Marcus alludes to the lack of leadership in Rome because of the death of the old Emperor, and thus asks Titus \\"Help to set a head on headless Rome\\" (1.1.186). Due to the appointment of Saturninus however, the breakdown of order accelerates; his wife is having an affair and bent only on revenge upon the Andronici, an invasion army is formed, Saturninus loses the support of the people, and his greatest general seemingly goes mad. The collapse of political order reaches an ironic apotheosis in the final scene, with the breakdown of all order as four murders are committed at a royal banquet in quick succession; Titus kills Lavinia, then Tamora, Saturninus kills Titus, and Lucius kills Saturninus. Immediately upon the restoration of harmony, however, Marcus urges a return to the Rome of old, \\"O, let me teach you how to knit again/This scattered corn into one mutual sheaf\\" (5.3.69–70), an order which Lucius subsequently promises to restore; \\"May I govern so,/To Rome's harms and wipe away her woe\\" (5.3.146–147). Thus the play ends with a promise of restored order, not with the actual restoration itself. Civilisation vs. Barbarism Another theme mentioned numerous times throughout the play is the conflict between civilisation and barbarism. For many of the characters, Rome is the epitome of a civilised society, with everything outside Rome seen as barbarous. This concept is introduced when Marcus intervenes in the debate between Bassianus and Saturninus, which is threatening to boil over into violence; > Let us entreat, by honour of [Titus'] name > Whom worthily you would have now succeed, > And in the Capitol and senate's right, > Whom you pretend to honour and adore, > That you withdraw you and abate your strength, > Dismiss your followers, and, as suitors should, > Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness. > :::::::1.1.39-45 Marcus feels that, as a civilised country, this is how Rome should act. He is also the great champion of civility when pleading with Titus to let Mutius be buried in the family tomb; > Suffer thy brother Marcus to inter > His noble nephew here in virtue's nest, > That died in honour and Lavinia's cause. > Thou art a Roman; be not barbarous: > The Greeks upon advise did bury Ajax, > That slew himself; and wise Laertes' son > Did graciously plead for his funerals; > Let not young Mutius then that was thy joy, > Be barred his entrance here. > :::::::1.1.377-384 However, not all of the characters agree with the simple equation that Rome is civilised and everything else barbaric. When Titus refuses to spare the life of Alarbus, for example; > TAMORA > O cruel, irreligious piety! > > CHIRON > Was never Scythia half so barbarous. > > DEMETRIUS > Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome. > :::::::1.1.130-132 Aaron too sees Roman civility as laughable, but in a different way to Chiron and Demetrius; \\"I urge thy oath; for that I know/An idiot holds his bauble for a god,/And keeps the oath which by that god he swears.\\" (5.1.78–80). Here, Aaron sees civilisation as nothing more than something foolish, peopled by idiots who keep their word. He returns to this theme in his final speech, glorying in his embracement of barbarism; > Ah, why should wrath be mute, and fury dumb? > I am no baby, I, that with base prayers > I should repent the evils I have done; > Ten thousand worse, than ever yet I did > Would I perform, if I might have my will. > If one good deed in all my life I did, > I do repent it from my very soul. > :::::::5.3.183-189 However, the play itself is ambiguous in its depiction of civilised characters and barbaric ones. For example, it ends with the apparently civilised Romans joining forces with the apparently barbarous Goths. However, according to both Jonathan Bate and Jacques Berthoud, the Goths at the end of the play are not the same Goths who had been led by Tamora. Bate believes the play \\"begins with a Roman stigmatisation of the Goths as barbarians, but modulates towards a very different view. If the Second Goth is a barbarian, what is he doing gazing \\"upon a ruinous monastery\\"? For the Elizabethans, history had lessons to teach the present, so this anachronism is purposeful.\\"Bate (1995: 19) Bate devises a thesis which suggests that the Goths who appear earlier in the play are 'evil' and those who follow Lucius are 'good'. Bate also argues that \\"at one level, the Goths at the end of the play are invading Rome because they wish to take revenge on their Queen Tamora for selling out and marrying Saturninus. But at the same time, they and Lucius share a language of faithful friendship, worthiness, honour and valour. They serve as a rebuke to the decadence into which Rome has fallen. This is of a piece with the play's persistent dissolution of the binary opposition which associates Rome and the city with virtue, the Goths and the woods with barbarism.\\"Jonathan Bate, \\"Lucius, the Severely Flawed Redeemer of Titus Andronicus: A Reply\\", Connotations 6.3 (Autumn 1997), 332 As Lucius tells Titus the tribunes are no longer listening to him, Titus begins to realise that the line between civilisation and barbarism is narrower than he thought; Jean-Michel Moreau illustration, engraved by N. le Mire (1785) Jacques Berthoud argues that the Goths at the end of the play are Germanic whereas Tamora is not a Germanic name, but is instead Asiatic, thus the Goths at the end of the play (the Germanic Goths) are not the Goths ruled over by Tamora (the barbaric Goths).Massai (2001: xlix) Speaking of Tamora's Goths, Berthoud argues \\"what these Goths have revealed about themselves is not that they are possessed by Satanic powers, but that they are, as it were, socially moronic. The Romans are Romans by virtue of the fact that they have internalised Rome; at an elementary level the Germanic Goths, too, are shown to have assimilated the qualities of a real, if unsophisticated culture. In contrast, these 'barbaric' Goths do not seem to have internalised anything ... they remain morally incomplete. It is for this reason that they regard the massively integrated Andronici as their pre-ordained foes.\\"Massai (2001: liv) On the other hand, Anthony Brian Taylor reads the end of the play as meaning that Rome has simply embraced barbarism, and \\"what motivates the Goths who have allied themselves to Lucius, is no sudden burst of uncharacteristic altruism but the prospect of revenge on Rome.\\"Taylor (1997:152) However, the question has been asked by many critics; is the Rome of Titus Andronicus really civilised itself? According to Robert Miola, it is not; \\"It devours its children – figuratively by consigning them to the gaping maw of the Andronici tomb, and literally by serving them in the bloody banquet at the play's end.\\"Miola (1981: 94) One of the inherent ironies of the play is the contradiction between Titus' civilised veneer when burying his sons, and the unfeeling cruelty he shows to Tamora regarding her own son. This is emphasised in his failure to adhere to his own doctrine that \\"Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge\\" (1.1.119). The simplistic distinction between the Romans as civilised and the Goths as barbarous is thus complicated. Markus Marti argues that the apparent contradiction in Titus, and in Rome at large, has more important ramifications beyond character psychology; > Behind a thin layer of cultural gloss lurks Mr Hyde, or rather, our cultural > achievements are a superstructure which consists of signifiers heaped upon > signifiers of signifiers, but which is ultimately grounded on a very ugly > material base which we try to hide, to forget, to dispel and ignore. Rome is > the right setting to show this, because this is the place where our culture > started in the eyes of an Elizabethan audience, and it is the place where it > reached its first peak, in literature, in law, in the building of an empire, > in the Pax Romana, in Christianity. But Rome was founded on murder and rape > – and if the cultural achievements of humanity – society, law, language, > literature – are followed back to their roots, if words are made flesh > again, all our cultural achievements turn out to be based on origins which > we now consider inhuman and beastly: on sacrifices, on rape and murder, on > revenge, on cannibalism.Marti (2004) Similarly, Jonathan Bate argues that the play depicts the Roman conversion from civility to barbarism; > The city prided itself on not being barbaric: the word \\"civilised\\" comes > from \\"civilis\\", which means \\"of citizens, of the city\\", and Rome was the > city. The religious rituals of a civilised culture, it was believed, > involved animal rather than human sacrifice. When Lucius demands that the > shadows be appeased through the lopping of the limbs of \\"the proudest > prisoner of the Goths\\" and the consuming of his flesh in the fire, barbarism > has entered the city. The first of the play's many reversals of expected > linguistic and behavioural codes takes place, and the supposedly barbaric > queen of Goths speaks a Roman language of valour, patriotism, piety, mercy > and nobility, whereas the Roman warriors go about their ritual killing.Bate > (1995: 6) Anthony Brian Taylor makes a similar argument concerning the character of Lucius, who he sees as \\"a deeply flawed Roman. Stolid, unimaginative, and soldierly, it never dawns on him that his readiness to commit unspeakable atrocities on man, woman, and child, is utterly barbaric and totally irreconcilable with the civilised values on which his life is centred. Moreover, in being a deeply flawed Roman, Lucius is his father's son, and as such, a fascinating extension of the play's central theme.\\"Taylor (1997: 145) Darragh Greene makes the point that it is Lucius and Marcus' mastery of rhetoric, the art of manipulating language, that undermines naive ideals of civilised order: \\"'Have we done aught amiss?' (5.3.126) asks Marcus, Tribune and so putative guardian and guarantor of the socio-moral order. Once the question is formulated, in an age of rhetoric that recognizes language is the tool for shaping perception, for making the world, the answer will be whatever Marcus or Lucius wish it to be for their own purposes.\\"Greene (2013: 73) References =Notes= All references to Titus Andronicus, unless otherwise specified, are taken from the Oxford Shakespeare (Waith), based on the Q1 text of 1594 (except 3.2, which is based on the folio text of 1623).

Titus Andronicus, probably written between 1588 and 1593, appeared in three quarto editions from 1594 to 1601 with no named author. It was first published under William Shakespeare's name in the 1623 First Folio of his plays. However, as with some of his early and late plays, scholars have long surmised that Shakespeare might have collaborated with another playwright. Other plays have also been examined for evidence of co-authorship, but none has been as closely scrutinised or as consistently questioned than Titus. The principal contender for the co- authorship is George Peele. The fact that Titus traditionally has the reputation of being Shakespeare's worst play is not unconnected to the in- depth examination of the play's authorship; and in fact many of the scholars who initially attempted to prove he had nothing to do with it did so in an effort to 'save' his reputation because they considered the play to be so badly written. Although the play's reputation improved somewhat in the latter half of the 20th century, the examination of authorship has intensified, generally along three possibilities: 1) Shakespeare wrote the play alone, 2) he co-wrote it with another author, and 3) he had nothing to do with the writing of it at all. Solid evidence Title page of the first quarto of Titus Andronicus (1594) Very little external evidence is extant regarding the question of authorship. None of the three quarto editions of Titus (1594, 1600 and 1611) name the author, normal practice for Elizabethan plays. Francis Meres lists Titus as one of Shakespeare's tragedies in Palladis Tamia in 1598, and John Heminges and Henry Condell included it in the First Folio in 1623. While this supports Shakespeare's authorship of the play, questions have tended to focus on the perceived lack of quality in the writing, and in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, the play's stylistic similarities to the work of contemporaneous dramatists. Pre-20th-century theories In 1687 Edward Ravenscroft was the first to question Shakespeare's authorship in the introduction his own adaptation of the play, Titus Andronicus, or The Rape of Lavinia, > I have been told by some anciently conversant with the Stage, that it was > not Originally his, but brought by a private Author to be Acted and he only > gave some Master-touches to one or two of the Principal Parts or Characters; > this I am apt to believe, because 'tis the most incorrect and indigested > piece in all his Works, It seems rather a heap of Rubbish then a Structure. Ravenscroft's vague comments tend not to be taken at face value by most critics.Waith (1984: 1)Hughes (2006: 10) Nevertheless, his idea seems to have been seized upon, and several 18th-century editors made similar claims; Nicholas Rowe in The Works of Mr. William Shakespear in Six Volumes (1709), Alexander Pope in The Works of Mr. William Shakespear (1725), Lewis Theobald in Shakespeare Restored (1726), Samuel Johnson and George Steevens in The Plays of William Shakespeare (1765) and Edmond Malone in The Plays and Poems of William Shakspeare (1790). All questioned Shakespeare's authorship, primarily due to the violence in the play, which they saw as far in excess of anything else in the canon, and what they perceived as uninspired verse, with each one concluding that at most Shakespeare wrote a scene or two. Other 18th- century scholars who questioned Shakespeare's authorship included William Guthrie in 1747, John Upton in 1748, Benjamin Heath in 1765, Richard Farmer in 1766, John Pinkerton in 1785, and John Monck Mason also in 1785.Vickers (2002: 152n11) So strong had the anti-Shakespearean movement become during the eighteenth century that in 1794, Thomas Percy wrote in the introduction to Reliques of Ancient English Poetry, \\"Shakespeare's memory has been fully vindicated from the charge of writing the play by the best critics.\\"Quoted in Waith (1984: 12) This trend continued into the 19th century. In 1817, for example, William Hazlitt denied the possibility of Shakespeare's authorship in Characters of Shakespear's Plays. Also in 1817, Samuel Taylor Coleridge made a similar claim in Biographia Literaria. Subsequently, in 1832, the Globe Illustrated Shakespeare went so far as to claim there was a universal agreement on the matter of authorship due to the un-Shakespearean \\"barbarity\\" of the play's action. Similarly, in An Introduction to the Literature of Europe in the Fifteenth, Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries (1840), Henry Hallam wrote \\"Titus Andronicus is now, by common consent, denied to be, in any sense, a production of Shakespeare.\\"Quoted in Vickers (2002: 155) In 1857, Charles Bathurst reiterated the claim that the play was so badly written, Shakespeare simply could not have had anything to do with it.Vickers (2002: 152) However, even in the midst of these doubts, there were voices arguing for Shakespeare's authorship. A major early defender of Shakespeare's claim to authorship was Edward Capell. In his 1768 ten-volume edition of the complete works of Shakespeare, Mr William Shakespeare, His Comedies, Histories and Tragedies, Capell acknowledged that the play was poorly written, but he argued that the violence was normal in the Elizabethan theatre, and he also pointed out the unlikelihood of Condell and Heminges including a play in the First Folio which they knew not to be by Shakespeare. Capell argued that nothing would be achieved by such a move, and in any case, there would have been any number of people who could have disputed such a thing. Capell also argued on aesthetic grounds that the play was Shakespearean, pointing specifically to Act 3 as being indicative of Shakespeare's style, and citing such elements as classical allusions and versification as more akin to Shakespeare than any other dramatist of the time. In 1843, Charles Knight, in the Preface to his pictorial edition of Shakespeare, specifically challenged claims that there was universal agreement that Shakespeare did not write the play. Knight pointed out that there was no such consent, especially in Germany, where Shakespeare was acknowledged by most major scholars as being the author. Knight made specific reference to August Wilhelm Schlegel and Hermann Ulrici.See Vickers (2002: 150-156) for a summary of the pre 20th century pro and anti-Shakespearean arguments. The question of co-authorship Twentieth century criticism has moved away from trying to prove or disprove that Shakespeare wrote the play, with most scholars now accepting that he was definitely involved in the composition in some manner, and has instead come to focus on the issue of co-authorship. The examination of the theory of co- authorship began in 1905, in John Mackinnon Robertson's Did Shakespeare Write Titus Andronicus? In an analysis of the feminine endings and general vocabulary, Robertson concluded that \\"much of the play is written by George Peele, and it is hardly less certain that much of the rest was written by Robert Greene or Kyd, with some by Marlowe.\\"Robertson (1905: 479) Robertson also suggested that Thomas Lodge may have contributed. Similarly, in 1919, T.M. Parrott reached the conclusion that Shakespeare revised the original work of Peele. Like Robertson, Parrott paid particular attention to feminine endings, which he argued were more abundant in Shakespeare than in any of his contemporaries. In Shakespeare's other work, feminine endings tended to be distributed evenly throughout the plays, but in Titus some scenes had far more than others. This led Parrott to conclude that there were two authors, and upon comparison with the distribution of feminine endings in other plays of the era, that the other author must be Peele. Parrott specifically concluded that 2.1 and 4.1 were by Peele (feminine endings of 2.3% and 2.5% respectively).Parrott (1919: 21-27) In 1931, Philip Timberlake modified Parrott's methodology and concluded that feminine endings composed 8.4% of the entire play, with Act I only 2.7%, and both 2.1 and 4.1 only 2.4% each. Other parts of the play had substantially more, such as 5.1 for example, which had 20.2%, or 3.2 which had 12.6%. In a comparative analysis, Timberlake discovered that Greene averaged 0.1-1.6%, Marlowe 0.4-3.7%, Kyd 1.2-10.2% and Peele 1.5-5.4%, with Shakespeare averaging 4.3-16.8%. These figures led Timberlake to conclude that Shakespeare definitely had a major hand in the play, but was not the sole author. He did not posit any specific collaborator, but suggested that his findings were in line with those of scholars who found traces of Peele or Greene.Timberlake (1931: 114-119) Why Peele? The main rationale for the predominance of Peele as co-author is due to certain linguistic characteristics which have been detected in the play. For example, J. Dover Wilson writes of the repetition of phrases and sentiments in Act 1 that \\"most of the clichés and tricks are indubitably Peele's. No dramatist of the age is so apt to repeat himself or so much given to odd or strained phrases.\\"Dover Wilson (xxix-xxx) Robertson identified 133 words and phrases in Titus which he felt strongly indicated Peele. Many of these concern Peele's poem The Honour of the Garter (1593). One word in particular has advanced the Peele argument; \\"palliament\\" (1.1.182), meaning robe and possibly derived from the Latin \\"pallium\\" and/or \\"palludamentum.\\" As first illustrated by George Steevens in 1773, this word occurs in only one other place outside Titus, in The Honour of the Garter. In relation to this, however, Hereward Thimbleby Price has argued that borrowing by Shakespeare is just as likely, if not more so, than repetition by Peele,Price (1935: 505) something reiterated by Jonathan Bate; \\"the problem with all the arguments based on verbal parallels is that imitation is always as likely as authorship.\\"Bate (1995: 82) Alan Hughes further points out that because the play appears to have undergone a period of revision, the situation is complicated even more, as it is unknown when the word was added; initially or during the revision.Hughes (2006: 5) Another commonly cited word is \\"architect\\". Titus is the only play in which Shakespeare used the word, whereas Peele used it four times. However, it was also commonly used by their contemporaries, so it provides no solid evidence of Peele's authorship.Waith (1984: 14-15) This is because, as Jonathan Bate has argued, a major problem with the vocabulary/grammar argument is that not only must certain words and grammatical constructions be shown to be common to Peele and uncommon to Shakespeare, they must also be shown to be uncommon to every other dramatist of the period as well, as only then do they provide direct evidence of Peele's authorship.See Bate (1995: 79-83) A similar argument has been made regarding the perceived lack of quality in the play. Sylvan Barnet, in his 1963 edition of the play for the Signet Classic Shakespeare argues \\"however displeased we may be by part or all of Titus, there is no utterly convincing evidence that it is not entirely by Shakespeare.\\"Barnet (2005: 2) Similarly, Eugene M. Waith argues, \\"That Shakespeare had a grander tragic vision or wrote finer dramatic poetry in other plays is no argument that he did not write this one.\\"Waith (1984: 13-14) Shakespeare as sole author The first major critic to challenge Robertson and Parrott was E.K. Chambers. Writing in 1930, in an essay entitled \\"The Disintegration of Shakespeare\\"; Chambers reacted to Robertson's general dismissal of the authoritativeness of the First Folio, and although he never mentions Titus specifically, he does set about countering Robertson's parallel vocabulary theory in general. Chambers’ criticisms of Robertson's methodologies have been accepted ever since, and Robertson's findings are no longer considered valid.Vickers (2002: 137) Subsequently, in 1933, Arthur M. Sampley employed the techniques of Parrott to argue against Peele as co- author. In his analysis of four of Peele's plays, The Arraignment of Paris (1584), The Love of King David and fair Bathseba (1588), The Famous Chronicle of King Edward the First (1593) and The Old Wives' Tale (1595), Sampley concluded that characteristics of Peele include complex plots, extraneous material in the dialogue, and a general lack of unity, none of which are present in Titus. Sampley argued that Act 1 in particular, usually cited as the most likely part of the play to have been written by Peele (such as by Dover Wilson for example, who provides a damning close reading of the theatrical quality of the actDover Wilson (1948: xxv-xxxiv)), is extremely tightly unified and sets up everything that follows perfectly. This is unlike anything found in any of Peele's plays.Sampley (1936: 693) In 1943, building on Sampley's work, Hereward Thimbleby Price wrote, \\"the best parallel by which we can test authorship is construction. Phrases may be borrowed here and there but construction refers to the planning of the work as a whole.\\"Price (1943: 55) Price concluded that the best examples of similar constructions to Titus are found in other plays by Shakespeare, not Peele. Like Sampley, Price concludes that although the opening scene does sound like Peele it is nothing like him in either construction or intent; \\"nothing in the work of Shakespeare's contemporaries can be compared to it for a moment.\\"Price (1943: 58) In a more general sense, Price argues that the play as a whole exhibited \\"intricacy with clearness, a firm hand on the story, a swift succession of effective situations logically leading out of what precedes and on to what follows, these are qualities lacking in the dramatists who are supposed to have shared in the composition of Titus.\\"Price (1943: 59) He also argued that the uneven distribution of feminine endings noted by Parrott and Timberlake was typical of Shakespeare's early plays.Price (1943: 65) Shakespeare as co- author In 1948, Dover Wilson rejected Chambers, Sampley and Price, and instead supported Parrott and Timberlake, believing that Shakespeare edited a play originally written by Peele; \\"we must look to George Peele for the authorship, not only of Act 1, but of most of the basic text upon which Shakespeare worked.\\" However, he goes on to assert that Shakespeare so thoroughly revised Peele \\"that Meres and the editors of the Folio were fully within their rights in calling it his. The aesthetic responsibility for it is therefore his also.\\"Dover Wilson (1948: xxv) He dismisses the involvement of Marlowe, Greene and Kyd and uses evidence of grammatical and metrical repetition in Act 1, especially the use of the vocative case.Dover Wilson (1948: xxvii-xxxii) He lists many pages of parallels with Peele's work; the poems The Tale of Troy (1579), The Honour of the Garter, An Eclogue Gratulatory (1589), Polyhymnia (1590), Descensus Astraeae (1591) and the plays The Arraignment of Paris (1584), The Battle of Alcazar (1588), David and Bathsheba (1588) and Edward I (1593). His theory is that originally, Peele wrote a short play for provincial performance by a touring company during the plague years of 1592–1594. However, upon returning to London, the play was deemed too short, and needed expanding, which is where Shakespeare got involved. Dover Wilson suggests that the reason Shakespeare was asked was because he was working on the thematically similar poems Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece at the time. However, because Shakespeare was unhappy working on the play, he purposely wrote badly. According to Dover Wilson \\"you can see him laughing behind his hand through most of the scenes he rehandled.\\"Dover Wilson (1948: xxxvi-xxxvii) In his Arden Shakespeare 2nd Series edition of the play in 1953, J.C. Maxwell stated that he wished he could assert that Shakespeare was the sole author, but because he was reminded so much of Peele's grammatical constructions, especially in Act 1, he could not.Maxwell (1953: xxxiii) In 1957, R.F. Hill approached the issue in another way; using rhetoric. He took 130 rhetorical devices and analysed their occurrence in eleven early Shakespearean plays, finding Titus anomalous in several ways. Alliteration was far more frequent in Titus than elsewhere, but Titus also contained far less sustained metaphors than in other plays in the canon. Both frequent alliteration and absence of lengthy metaphors occur most in Act 1.Hill (1957: 65) Hill also analysed antimetabole, epanalepsis, epizeuxis and \\"the repetition of a clause with an inversion in the order of its grammatical parts.\\"Hill (1957: 68) His discovery that Act 1 was unique in the amount of all of these rhetorical devices when compared with the rest of the canon led him to conclude that Shakespeare did not write it. In 1979, MacDonald P. Jackson approached the issue from another new perspective; a rare word test. His results showed a marked difference between Act 1, 2.1 and 4.1 on the one hand, and the rest of the play on the other. He showed that in Act 1, 2.1 and 4.1, rare vocabulary occurred much less frequently than in any other Shakespeare play, whereas in the rest of the play rare words are more common, placing it closest to The Taming of the Shrew. Jackson acknowledged that this discrepancy could possibly have arisen from Shakespeare returning to edit a play he wrote in his youth, and complicating the vocabulary at that time, but he favours the suggestion of Peele as co-author, especially insofar as the rare word distribution of Act 1 is roughly analogous to Peele's own plays.Studies in Attribution: Middleton and Shakespeare (Salzburg: Salzburg University Press, 1979), 147-153 In his 1984 edition of the play for The Oxford Shakespeare, Eugene M. Waith argued for Shakespeare's sole authorship. Believing that Titus was Shakespeare's first attempt at tragedy, he argued that any lapses can be attributed to uncertainty and inexperience rather than co-authorship. Brian Vickers, however, is highly critical of Waith's analysis, attacking his \\"blanket refusal either to report the case for co-authorship fairly, or to engage in a series evaluation of its arguments.\\" He also believes that Waith's \\"evidence consists largely in suppressing the evidence of other scholars.\\"Vickers (2002: 201-202) In the Oxford Shakespeare Complete Works of 1986, in his introduction to the play, Stanley Wells makes no reference to the authorship debate whatsoever, but in the 1987 Textual Companion, Gary Taylor explicitly states that Shakespeare appears to have written only part of the play. Accepting the evidence of feminine endings which seem to suggest that Shakespeare did not write Act 1, 2.1 and 4.1, Taylor supported Jackson's findings in 1979. In 1987, Marina Tarlinskaja used a quantitative analysis of the occurrence of stresses in the iambic pentameter line, producing a stress profile for each play studied. Her complex analysis divided Titus into an A part (Act 1, 2.1 and 4.1) and a B part (everything else). She ultimately concluded that part A was written in a more archaic style than part B, and that each part was almost certainly written by a different person. Part B corresponded to stress analysis elsewhere in Shakespeare's early drama; part A to Peele's later drama.Shakespeare's Verse: Iambic Pentameter and the Poet's Idiosyncrasies (New York: P. Lang, 1987), 121-124 In his 1994 edition of the play for the New Cambridge Shakespeare, Alan Hughes dismissed the possibility of Shakespeare having a co-author. He believes that in a first draft of the play written before Shakespeare came to London, and which is now lost, Shakespeare was heavily influenced by Peele, but when he returned to edit the play c.1593 he removed much of the Peele influence, although he left Act 1 untouched.Hughes (2006: 12) Again, Vickers is highly critical of Hughes' methods, believing that he simply wasn't familiar enough with the scholarship to make any kind of claim regarding authorship, and criticising his \\"refusal either to cite the scholarly tradition fairly or to think for himself about the large stylistic discrepancies within the play.\\"Vickers (2002: 206) In his 2006 revised edition of the play, Hughes' arguments remained unchanged, and he makes no response to Vickers' criticisms. In 1995, Brian Boyd tackled the issue by focusing on repetition in the parts of the play attributed to Peele. He illustrated that references to Rome (\\"Romans\\", \\"Rome's\\" etc.) occur 68 times in 495 lines (1 in every 7 lines), but elsewhere in the play such references occur only 54 times in 1944 lines (1 in 36). This low figure matches Shakespeare's other Roman plays; Julius Caesar (1 in 38), Coriolanus (1 in 34) and Antony and Cleopatra (1 in 39). This suggested to Boyd that Act 1 was unique. He also analysed the use of the words \\"brother\\" and \\"brethren\\". In Act 1, \\"brethren\\" is used four times, but elsewhere in the play only once. However, Act 1 uses \\"brother\\" only once, but elsewhere it is used seven times. In their other plays, Shakespeare uses \\"brother\\" much more often than \\"brethren\\", whereas Peele tended to favour \\"brethren\\", again indicative of the uniqueness of Act 1 and tentative evidence for Peele's co-authorship.Boyd (1995: 301-306) In his 1995 edition of the play for the Arden Shakespeare 3rd series, Jonathan Bate argued that Shakespeare almost certainly wrote the play alone. However, since that time, Bate has come out in support of Brian Vickers' 2002 book Shakespeare, Co-Author which restates the case for Peele as the author of Act 1.Chernaik (2004: 1030) Writing in the program for the 2003 Royal Shakespeare Company production of the play, Bate states > if the play has a fault, it is that the formality of both language and > action in the opening scenes create a sense of stiffness that suggests > classicism at its most tedious. This is probably not Shakespeare's fault: > modern scholarship has persuasively demonstrated by means of close stylistic > analysis that Titus Andronicus was begun by another dramatist, George Peele, > who had a high-level classical education and a taste for large-scale > symmetrical stage encounters spoken in high-flown rhetoric. We don't know > whether the play was written as a purposeful collaboration or whether > Shakespeare came in to do a re-write or to complete an unfinished work. Nor > do we know at precisely what point the writing became his alone - though > there is no doubt that he is the author of all the most dramatic scenes, > from the rape through the hand-chopping to the fly-killing banquet to the > feast at the climax.Program for 2003 RSC production, n.p. In 1996, Macdonald Jackson returned to the authorship question by focusing on the stage directions in the 1594 quarto (Q1) and compared them to stage directions in Peele. In particular, the phrase \\"and others as many as can be\\" is found in both Titus (1.1.69) and Peele's Edward I (1.1.1). Due to the lack of specificity, this stage direction is usually taken as authorial (stage directions added by the theatre or acting company tend to be more specific). Jackson pointed out that these two examples are the only recorded examples in all of Elizabethan theatre.Jackson (1996: 136) He also identified a hybrid form of speech headings combined with stage business in Q1; e.g. \\"Marcus Andronicus with the Crowne\\" (1.1.17) and \\"all kneele and say\\" (1.1.386). Nowhere else in all of Shakespeare is this hybridisation seen, but it is common throughout Peele, especially in Edward I e.g. \\"Longshanks kisses them both and speaks\\", \\"Bishop speaks to her in her bed\\". Jackson found twenty examples in Edward I; six each in The Battle of Alcazar and David and Bathseba and eleven in The Arraignment of Paris.Jackson (1996: 139) He combined these discoveries with a new metrical analysis of the function words \\"and\\" and \\"with\\". In Act 1 of Titus, the rate of these words is every 12.7 lines, but elsewhere in the play it is every 24.7 lines. Elsewhere in Shakespeare, the lowest rate is in The Comedy of Errors (17.6), but in Peele's plays, the rate is always between 8.3 and 13.6. Jackson concluded that the chances of this being a coincidence are less than one in ten thousand, arguing that \\"Peele shows the same partiality for \\"and\\" and \\"with\\" that distinguishes Act 1 of Titus Andronicus from the rest of the Shakespeare canon.\\"Jackson (1996: 145) Subsequently, in 1997, Jackson revised Boyd's figures somewhat, pointing out that \\"brothers\\" and \\"brethren\\" occur nine times each in Titus; eight of the examples of \\"brethren\\" are in Act 1, but only one example of \\"brothers\\". In Shakespeare's early plays, there are twenty-three uses of \\"brothers\\" and only two of \\"brethren\\", whereas in Peele there are nine uses of \\"brethren\\" and only one of \\"brothers\\".Jackson (1997: 494) Brian Vickers The most extensive analysis of the co-authorship theory is that of Brian Vickers in 2002. A strong advocate of the Peele theory, Vickers opens his preface by arguing \\"given that collaboration was very common in Elizabethan, Jacobean and Caroline theatre, and that every major and most minor dramatists shared in the writing of plays, it would be highly unusual if Shakespeare had not done so.\\"Vickers (2002: vii) As well as elaborating on the work of previous analysts such as Parrott, Timberlake, Dover Wilson, Tarlinskaja, Boyd and Jackson, Vickers devises three additional authorship tests.Vickers (2002: 219-230) The first is an analysis of polysyllabic words (words of three syllables or more, excluding names), a test which has been successfully used to distinguish the work of John Webster and Thomas Dekker. Vickers shows that in Act 1, 2.1 and 4.1, polysyllabic words occur every 2.8 lines, a comparable number to elsewhere in Peele. Elsewhere in Titus, however, the rate is every 3.3 lines, similar to elsewhere in Shakespeare. His second test involves counting examples of alliteration, a technique favoured by Peele throughout his career. In Act 1, 2.1 and 4.1, alliteration is found at a rate of once every 2.7 lines. Elsewhere in the play, it occurs every 4.3 lines. The high rate of Act 1 corresponds to the average rate in Peele and the low rate elsewhere to the rate in Shakespeare. The third test is counting vocatives. In Act 1, 2.1 and 4.1, the rate of vocatives is once every 4.2 lines. Elsewhere it is once every 8.7 lines. As comparison, in Peele's Edward I, the rate is once every 4.3 lines, and throughout Shakespeare, it never falls below once every 6.3 lines. Again, the numbers seem to equate Peele with Act 1, 2.1 and 4.1 and Shakespeare with the rest of the play. Vickers also attempts to show that Shakespeare is much more adept at employing rhetorical devices than Peele; and gives numerous examples throughout the play of the use of antimetabole, anadiplosis, epanalepsis, epizeuxis, articulus, epanorthosis, epistrophe, aposiopesis, anaphora, polyptoton, synoeciosis, polysyndeton and asteismus. His analysis of these devices leads him to conclude \\"whether using the same rhetorical figures as Peele had used, or deploying his own much wider thesaurus, Shakespeare distinguishes himself from his co-author by the economy, functionality and the expressive power with which he employs these traditional resources.\\"Vickers (2002: 239) References =Citations= =Further reading= * Barnet, Sylvan (ed.)

The first book in the series was written when Davies was only eight years old. The books chronicle the adventures of a tweenage spy, her friends, parents and pets. While the main protagonist shares the same name as the author, the account is not autobiographical but rather the relationship takes the form of an alter ego. The first two books were initially non-commercially self-published, but were subsequently picked up by a third-party commercial publishing house. All four books are now commercially published and available both online and through physical bookshops. The books are of \\"Kids-for-Kids\\" (K4K) genre—books written by kids, for kids. Plot The plot revolves around a normal ten-year-old girl and who one day discovers her parents are spies and that she, in turn, is a \\"spyling\\" (a young spy). She is introduced to the secret spy organisation, \\"Silggem\\", which is commanded by the mysterious Director C. Each book involves her being sent on a mission, assisted either by her parents or her friends. Each spyling has a spy pet, who sometimes also helps with missions. The spylings are also provided with many Silggem gadgets such as rocket boots and hover boards. In early books, the missions involve adult supervision, while in later books the missions are conducted solo and, in some cases, involve rescuing grown-ups. The main character ages by about six months between each book. Author The first book in the series was written by the author at the age of eight, for her own entertainment. Because her parents did not allow her to use electronic gadgets to entertain herself in cafes and restaurants, she had taken to writing stories in a notebook. On a family holiday, it was one of these stories that continued to grow and grow in scope, until after a period of several months, it attained a length of 6500 words. The story was subsequently typed up and POD printed for consumption by family and friends. Enthused by this, encouraged by her school, and captivated by the character, she then went on to write the second book in the series. Both books were given to friends and family, with more than one hundred being given out. Editing Although professionally edited, the work stays true to the \\"K4K\\" genre by retaining the child's voice. The finished product is grammatically correct with correct punctuation and spelling. Only relatively light editing was required to attain this standard. The books include line-art illustrations by the author, drawn on paper, scanned and contrast-adjusted by the author before final insertion in the manuscript. Critical reception The ideal reading age for these books is eight to ten years. Early non-commercial distribution established that children consumed the books with great enthusiasm, even when the capability of the reader was slightly above the level of the writing. Subsequent investigation showed that child readers were particularly enthused because: * they could \\"hear\\" the author was a child, and thus the material was different in character to other chapter books, and was clearly aimed at them. Put another way, it was written in \\"kid language\\", rather than an adult, or an adult feigning kid language * the notion that a kid could write a book frequently inspired them to pick up a pen and do likewise Reviewed by Ursula Dubosarsky, the books were rated as Highly Recommended. Because JJ Halo encouraged non-readers to read, and encouraged readers to write, it was also met with enthusiasm by parents and some educational institutions. Publisher Around this time, a new publishing company called ACE Press was being launched. ACE became aware of the works and decided to add them to its initial stable of titles. ACE Press subsequently launched on 18 September 2010 at a function hosted at Gleebooks in Sydney, Australia, with two JJ Halo books and three other books. The launch was covered by Television Sydney on its Shelf Life program. The author and her best friend performed readings from her book, and she was interviewed. At this time, the third book in the series was already finished. Some years later, ACE Press decided to substantially trim its catalog and removed many of its titles, including the JJ Halo series. The books are now available on Amazon. The ISBNs of the original ACE Press editions are: 9780980786415, 9780980786422 and 9780980786439. Books =First Mission= JJ Halo, First Mission () is the first book in the series where we meet the main character, her parents, the spy organisation Silggem. JJ is trained in the use of various gadgets and sent on her first mission, where she meets her new friend, Ava. The mission involves an evil stationery brand which intends to take over the world, and the friends must defeat the stationery brand to save the day. =Shaddow Returns= The second book in the JJ Halo series JJ Halo, Shaddow Returns ( ) commences with the bad news that Shaddow, another evil brand, has broken free of the Silggem jail and stolen the brain controller gadget. Director C provides JJ with a collection of cool gadgets and then assigns her to the case. JJ and Ava track Shaddow through a dangerous forest full of carnivorous plants and animals to an alpine environment which tests their snowboarding skills to the limit. After several close shaves, they eventually find the Shaddow HQ where they are able to sneak in. They are unfortunately captured and incarcerated, and discover their parents have become henchmen of the evil Shaddow organization. It turns out her parents are under the influence of the brain controller, which Ava and JJ manage to overcome through a combination of bravery and happenstance. After breaking a code, the four heroes escape from the HQ and activate a self- destruct mechanism. Upon returning to Silggem there is a huge celebration. =Time Travel Trouble= The third book in the JJ Halo series JJ Halo, Time Travel Trouble () opens with JJ's parents being thrown down a volcano to their death by the fiendish Mr Gnop. Director C breaks the bad news to JJ, and JJ resigns herself to her new life, but then decides to make unauthorised use of a Time Turner gadget to travel back in time and rescue her parents before they meet their doom. As always, JJ is issued with a collection of cool new gadgets, including a necklace of figurines that are able to deploy amazing functionality. They teleport to the volcano island where Mr Gnop has his HQ and conduct reconnaissance during which they find a pet which is being badly cared-for, and which they rescue. They continue searching the HQ, and JJ teaches Ava how to scuba dive so they can penetrated through sunken passageways. They finally find the correct location, and then use the Time Turner to travel through time, first mistakenly traveling a million years into the past, and then mistakenly traveling into the future where they encounter a very cool and futuristic shop and an amusement park. They then travel back in time to the correct time and place where JJ's parents were thrown into the volcano to their deaths. The two girls set up a holographic project to disguise their activities, and manage to save the two grown-ups just at the moment they were about to hit the lava. In the process, JJ over-balances and falls towards the lava, but manages to self-rescue using a combination of gadgets and pluckiness. Joining forces, the two girls and two adults go in pursuit of Mr Gnop, and discover he has two daughters. The daughters turn out to be quite nice, so they rescue the girls while teleporting Mr Gnop to jail. Finally, they return to Silggem HQ where a large celebration ensues. An epilogue reveals Mr Gnop is not content to languish in jail, but is already plotting his revenge. =Spy Pet Chaos= Spy Pet Chaos In Spy Pet Chaos (), the fourth book of the JJ Halo series, the evil Mr Gnop and Mr Grimm kidnap JJ's spy pet and threaten to destroy the world. Secret agent JJ Halo must break codes, fly a helicopter, pilot a rocket and avoid asteroids to save the day. But just when it seems like Mr Grimm has been defeated, everything goes seriously wrong and the whole of Silggem depends on rescue from a very unusual agent. The fourth book has a slightly older reading age than the earlier titles. It was written straight after book three, but there was a delay in publishing due to school activities. =Sidekick= Written in collaboration with two other tweenage authors, Sidekick is aimed at ten- to thirteen-year- olds and examines issues confronting tweenage girls in school and social settings, all placed in an adventure setting. This book is completely separate from the JJ Halo series, featuring all new characters. Illustrations were provided by a tweenage illustrator, and for this book, she performed all the editing, formatting, pagination, cover design and paste-up. It is not only written by a kid (kids, actually), but it is also produced by a kid.

Her older brother was Henry Fitzhugh. Ann Fitzhugh and Gerrit Smith's Peterboro, New York home was a station on the Underground Railroad.

Ann Fitzhugh Smith frequently traveled via an enclosed carriage to permit her carriage to be used, in her absence, to convey veiled fugitives on their way to Canada.U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service, Elizabeth Smith Miller (Apr. 15, 2011). In 1822, Fitzhugh – living in Rochester, New York and formerly of Hagerstown, Maryland – married Gerrit Smith. She was devout and was influential in Gerrit Smith's religious conversion and beliefs about social reform and slavery. Abolitionist The Smith household hosted both abolitionist and early suffrage meetings in the pre-Civil War period. As a child in Chewsville, near Hagerstown, Maryland, she was given a slave, Harriet Sims, who was sold and was further enslaved in Kentucky, with her spouse Samuel Russell. Ann and Gerrit located the Russells, purchased their freedom in 1841 and aided them in settling at Peterboro.Gerrit Smith Estate, National Historic Landmark Nomination NPS Form 10-900 USDI/NPS NRHP Registriation Form (Rev. 8-86) OMB No. 1024 0018. The Smith couple had joined the abolition movement fully in October 1835, after a meeting of the New York State Anti-Slavery Society in Utica, New York was forcibly broken up by local slaving sympathizers. The couple interceded from the audience, and offered the Peterboro mansion as a safe haven to reconvene the gathering.Judith Wellman, The road to Seneca Falls: Elizabeth Cady Stanton and the First Women's Rights Convention (2004) at page 38. While Ann's daughter Elizabeth attended a Quaker school in Philadelphia, Ann stayed in the city for extended periods during 1836-37 and 1839. These stays brought Ann into the circle of Lucretia and James Mott, abolitionists C.C. Burleigh and Mary Grew. Ann and her daughter taught Sunday school in one of Philadelphia's African- American communities.Judith Wellman, The road to Seneca Falls: Elizabeth Cady Stanton and the First Women's Rights Convention (2004) at page 38. The Ann Fitzhugh and Gerrit Smith Household Ann was seventeen when she married Smith. According to one historian, \\"Ann brought warmth and cheerful serenity to her new home, and she and Gerrit had a very loving marriage, 'Heaven has broke loose!' Gerrit once exclaimed when Ann entered the room. \\" The Smiths lived in a large frame house facing Peterboro green. It was built in the hall- and-parlour style, with a large central hall front to back. The library of about 2,000 volumes, dining room and kitchen flanked the central hall on one side; a parlour and conservatory lay on the other. The Smiths emphasized equality, simplicity, intellectualism and spirituality in their domestic life. After 1835, the two would not serve food grown with slave labor. During the 1830s, the Smiths deemphasized their Calvinist theology and began exploring the perfectionist and ultraist beliefs common in the Christian Union movement. This led to their founding Free Churches at Oswego and Peterboro, New York in 1839 and 1843 respectively.

Fitzhugh descended paternally from William Fitzhugh of Bedford, England, born in 1570. Henry Fitzhugh, also of Bedford, was born to the eponymous William in 1615. The first Colonel William Fitzhugh, son of Henry, was also born in 1651 at Bedford. The first Colonel William emigrated to Westmoreland County, Virginia. He married Sarah Tucker (May 1, 1674), and died in 1701. His son, George Fitzhugh, farmed in Stafford County, Virginia, and was spouse to Mary Mason. The next Colonel William Fitzhugh, also of Stafford County, Virginia, was George's son born on January 11, 1721. He was Ann Fitzhugh Smith's grandfather and died February 11, 1798. He married Mrs. Anne Rousby (1727–1793), née Frisby, of Cecil County, Maryland, on January 7, 1752. She was born September 15, 1727, and died March 26, 1793. Colonel William Fitzhugh (1761–1839) of the Hive Ann's father, was born in Calvert County, Maryland.\\"William D. Fitzhugh\\" in Augustus H. Gansser The History of Bay County, Michigan (1905). Ann's mother, Ann Hughes (1771–1828), was daughter to iron mongering entrepreneur Daniel Hughes of Washington County, Maryland. Ann Hughes married Colonel William at Saint John's Episcopal Church, Hagerstown, on October 18, 1789. The Fitzhughs and the Hughes were communicants at Saint John's Episcopal Church, Hagerstown, Maryland. The Ascension Window in St. John's north transept was donated in memory of Ann Fitzhugh's mother. Their daughter Ann, and her spouse Gerrit, were relatively secure financially, except immediately after the Panic of 1837. After that crash, the Smiths moved from the Peterboro mansion to a cottage. Both Ann and her daughter. Elizabeth, clerked in Gerrit Smith's land office to economize.Western New York Suffragist, Elizabeth Smith (April 15, 2011 ). Ann and Gerritt joined the Peterboro Presbyterian Church in 1826. They had seven children, five of whom died young.Gerrit Smith Estate, NPS Form 10-900.

It was located on the southwest shore of Meadow Lake, about 18 miles northwest of Truckee as the crow flies. Situated at an elevation of above sea level, the reservoir of the same name is one of the highest lakes in elevation within the Tahoe National Forest. History The area was first developed to help satisfy the demand for water to work the gold-bearing claims scattered in the foothills and valleys of Northern California's Nevada County and Sierra County. The area contained an inexhaustible supply of water, which could be collected in reservoirs and conducted by aqueducts and flumes to lower elevation mining locales. In the summer of 1858, the South Yuba Canal Company erected a stone wall across a 900 feet (270 m) ravine through which flowed a tributary of the South Yuba River, forming the Meadow Lake reservoir.Bean, Edwin F., (1867) History and Directory of Nevada County, (hereafter Bean ), p. 305-6; Fatout, Paul, (1969) Meadow Lake Gold Town, (hereafter Fatout), p. 28. From it, parts of Nevada City and southwestern Nevada County obtained their principal supply of water during several months of the year. It measures 50 feet (15 m) in height, 15 feet (4.6 m) width at its apex, and is built of granite. In 1860, Henry Hartley, a trapper, built a cabin in the area. In 1863, he noticed some gold flakes in granite ledges. With John Simons and Henry Feutel, he formed the \\"Excelsior Company\\" to work their claims about one mile south of the lake. The next year, the California Company staked out several additional claims.Bean, p. 307, Fatout, pp. 29-31. The town's heyday occurred from 1865 to 1868 with the economy built on the prospect of finding substantial gold ore. In 1865, rumors of abundant gold around the lake began to spread. One newspaper reported that its assay showed $55,000 in gold and silver to the ton of rock.Virginia Union, June 14, 1865, quoted in Fatout at page 33. There were of course, skeptics. The Nevada Gazette was \\"inclined of the opinion that the richness of that locality has been somewhat overrated.\\" July 11, 1865. Judge Tilford, the respected author of the section on Meadow Lake in Bean’s History, commented: “The writer is happy to have it in his power to state that assays since made, as well as results of milling on a large scale, have confirmed the judgment of the original locators, and demonstrated that these claims are among the foremost of the district.”Bean, p, 307. Soon, thousands of miners and speculators rushed in staking out over a thousand claims and creating a boom in mining shares.Chinese miners were driven out. Grass Valley Union, Aug. 15, 1865. Many were from the Virginia City area, where concerns had spread that the local mines were “played out.”Bean p. 307-8. By late June, a 160-acre townsite was laid out by a surveyor hired by Virginia City promoters A. C. \\"Alex\\" Wightman and Charley Parker.Fatout, p. 37.Bean at p. 308 identifies the surveyor as Erick Prahm. Fatout at p. 35 identifies the surveyor as J.A. Brumsey. Summit City, as it was named, was a planned community with streets intersecting at right angles and named in lettered order in one direction and numerical order in the other, and a plaza at its heart.Bean p. 308; Fatout, p. 36. By late summer, Summit City reportedly had 10 stores, five lumberyards, 10 hotels, five blacksmith shops, many, many bars, gambling houses, a brewery, a book and stationary store, a cigar store, a barbershop, a church, and a 10 piece brass band. An excursion vessel ferried revelers to four hurdy-gurdy houses (dance halls) at the lake’s upper end.Comstock, David and Zimmerman, Bernard (2018). Exploring Nevada County: Historical Landmarks. You Bet Press. (electronic edition), site 143; Fatout, p. 48. Not satisfied with a private school, the citizens petitioned the Board of Supervisors to create a school district. Soon, the Board created the Altamont school district.Nevada Gazette, Nov. 14, 1865. Summit City had more businesses than any other town in Nevada County except Nevada City and Grass Valley.Nevada Gazette, Aug. 30, 1865. About 150 houses had been erected.Bean, p. 309. A stage ran daily to Virginia City and a tri-weekly Pony Express ran from Nevada City.Nevada Gazette, July 18, 1865. Tollroads spidered out from the town in various directions, including to the Henness Pass road, and to the Central Pacific Railroad in Cisco.Fatout, pp. 40-48;. 40; Lardner, W.B. and Brock, M.J. (1924) History of Placer and Nevada Counties California, (hereafter Lardner), p. 437. Prominent residents included Mark Twain‘s brother, lawyer Orion Clemens. The town had a court, presided over by Judge Jones, a jail, a marshal and several other lawyers.Fatout, p. 61. In the fall of 1865, immigration all but ceased. Many residents left and the town’s population dropped to about 200 people. Heavy as the snows were, the town was never completely cut off. Pack trains ran regularly to Dutch Flat and Granville Zachariah, known as “Zack’s Snowshoe Express,” carried mail, newspapers and the like. The locals passed the winter by skiing and snowshoeing.Fatout, p. 56. In February 1866, The Nevada County Board of Supervisors formed the County’s ninth township, called Meadow Lake, consisting of 884 sq. mi. with Shasta Lake, California its center.Nevada Transcript, Feb. 17, 1866; Bean, p. 305. Soon, the gold rush resumed and Summit City rapidly expanded.Fatout, p. 68. That spring, Wells Fargo opened an express office, and a bank was formed.Nevada Gazette, April 27, 1866. Stage service to Grass Valley was increased to meet the demand.Grass Valley Union, June 23, 1866. federal government opened a post office in June and appointed Melvin Wilson as postmaster.Janicot, Michel, A History of Nevada County Post Offices (1994), pp. 23-4. June also saw the founding of a daily paper, the Meadow Lake Morning Sun.Fatout, p. 73. Capitalizing on its explosive growth, the town petitioned the legislature to incorporate Summit City, with a name change to Meadow Lake to avoid confusion with another Summit City in Alpine County.Nevada Gazette, March 12, 1866. The California legislature incorporated the town of Meadow Lake, effective June 13, 1866.Fatout, pp. 66-7. By midsummer, the town had over 600 houses and other buildings, 4-5,000 residents. and six functioning ore processing mills, all of which had come into being the prior 15 months at an estimated cost of more than $2 million.Fatout, p. 89. On June 14, 1865, the Virginia City Union reported “very rich specimens of gold and silver bearing rock, which fully equal if not surpass anything we have heretofore seen.”Fatout, p. 33. Its reporter Alfred Doten wrote that the rock \\"promises to be the richest discovered on this coast, and perhaps in the world.\\" Doten, Alfred, An Early Report on Meadow Lake, Nevada County Historical Society Bulletin, Vol. 41, No. 2, (April 1987), pp. 16-17. The reality was that the gold in the granite ledges was often combined with many other metals, such as iron and manganese, in combinations called sulphurets, which made it difficult to extract the gold. Some of the minerals in the \\"rebellious\\" ore neutralized the effect of mercury and prevented the gold from amalgamating.Thompson, Thomas H. and West, Albert A. (1970 ed.) History of Nevada County -1880, (hereafter Thompson), p. 196. Mills to crush the rock were necessary but initially there were none and rock had to be taken to Virginia City, Nevada or Nevada City, California to be crushed. The dollar returns on the crushed rock were much less than had been predicted.Fatout, pp. 50-51, 64. When the town was established out in 1865, good lots sold for $25. By late summer of that year, the price of lots had soared to $800. In 1866, fueled by continuing exaggerated reports of rich gold strikes and by an exploding influx of gold seekers, the price of lots soared again, to the $1500–2500 range.Bean, p. 308, 311; Fatout, p. 48. Construction of buildings continued at a rapid pace, slowed only by shortages of lumber.Fatout, pp. 68-9. At the same time, that summer saw the creation of the Excelsior Stock and Exchange Board which helped fuel speculative trading in mining shares. Judge Tilford had this to say about the Stock Board: “Considering that there was not at the time a mine developed, or ledge visible, in the whole district, the transaction was unique and refreshingly cool. With solemn visages, night after night the members assembled, a long roll of stocks was called, and no bids made. Verily the sellers were many, but alas! purchasers were few! In the town the whole affair was regarded as a farce...”Bean, p. 312. As the difficulties being encountered in separating the gold from the metals to which it was bound became known, people begin to wonder whether the oft-discussed riches were just speculative.Fatout, p. 70. By late summer, a recession began as people started to leave the area, often abandoning their homes. In August, the citizens voted to suspend town government.Nevada Transcript, Aug.11, 1866. The price of land and mining stocks plummeted.Fatout, pp. 83-4. During August 1866, a total of about $5000 in gold was shipped from Meadow Lake, a tiny fraction of what was shipped from Virginia City.Fatout, p. 87. By one estimate, the $2 million investment in the mines yielded gold worth a total of about $100,000.Thompson, p. 74. Mark Twain visited the city in 1866 and described it as: “the wildest exemplar of speculation I have ever stumbled upon….they have built a handsome town and painted it neatly and planned long wide streets, and got ready for a rush of business, and then - jumped aboard the stage coaches and deserted it!… A bright, new, pretty town all melancholy and deserted, and yet showing not one sign of decay or dilapidation. I never saw the like before!”Fatout, p. 91. That winter was very severe with snow drifts of 20 to 30 feet. The town was practically isolated. Still the residents found time for men's and women's snowshoe races, with handsome prizes.Nevada Transcript, March 19, 1867. In the spring of 1867, few people returned. The newspaper suspended publication that November. By the summer of 1868, the town was reduced to a hotel, two restaurants, four stores, a brewery and six saloons, and the post office.The post office closed September, 211969. Janicot, ibid. The population was about 150. By 1869, most of the homes were empty and decaying. The population was less than 50.Fatout, pp. 106-09. In 1873, a fire that began in the Excelsior Hotel destroyed much of the town center.Lardner, p. 437; Fatout, p. 116. Following the fire, one observer reported “the site was dreary enough to glad the eyes of a broken Meadow Laker, whose chief occupation was to drink whiskey and curse the day he ever saw the place.\\"Thompson, p. 75. When Hartley died in the fall of 1892, not a single permanent resident remained in Meadow Lake. For many years, periodic finds of new gold deposits, or reported improvements in the process of removing gold from the sulphurets, kept some of the mines going.Thompson, p. 196; Fatout, p. 110-11. But few of these dreams ever materialized. Instead, the place earned sobriquets such as \\"the Mushroom City\\" and \\"the City of the Day.\\"Thompson, p. 195. By the 1940s nothing remained of the buildings which had once housed thousands.Fatout, p. 146. = Today = Meadow Lake lies within the Tahoe National Forest. The Ranger Station is located in Sierraville, California. Remaining are several mining sites, foundations, the cemetery, and the dam. A campground is located near the lake shore.Campground information can be found at https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/tahoe/recarea/?recid=55556 Not too far from the old townsite are several rocks covered with petroglyphs attributed to the Martis people. That site is on the National Register of Historic Places.Comstock, ibid, site 142.

According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 4.19 million viewers in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Jon Glaser, Larry Murphy, and Andy Kindler. Plot Tina is hitting puberty by lying on the kitchen floor, groaning in front of her family. Bob orders Tina to do her grill cooking job as their father-daughter time. Gene and Louise later show Tina a surprise outside the restaurant while Bob works alone, revealing to Tina a capoeira class where she begins to have a crush on the long-haired headmaster, Jairo (Jon Glaser). Tina signs up for the class and practices capoeira a lot at home, but the rest of the family compares capoeira to dancing. Tina becomes more interested in Jairo and extends her classes to see him more. Meanwhile, the other kids fail at taking over Tina's grill cooking position and Bob needs to go to the toilet at 4:30 like he usually does (he refers to it as an afternoon meeting) but Tina is not at the restaurant to cover for him. Bob postpones his meeting and goes to the capoeira studio to demand that Tina go back into the restaurant. While there, Bob meets Jairo and criticizes him and capoeira. Jairo forces Bob to have a duel with him, which he easily wins by whipping his hair at him and making him fall and embarrassingly poop in his pants. Bob wants his family to never mention what happened at the class and forbids Tina from continuing to attend the class. Tina resumes lying on the floor and groaning throughout the rest of night. Jairo visits the restaurant the next day after receiving a letter from Tina (which was actually from Louise who forged Tina's name to get her father to take revenge on Jairo for the incident) and suggests that Tina should come back because next week all attenders will get promoted to yellow cord. Tina goes with Jairo and quits her job at the restaurant. The family goes to Tina's promotion except for Bob who stays to take care of the restaurant. While Tina is getting ready for her yellow cord, Bob gets in a huge argument with Teddy but later calms down and closes the restaurant to watch Tina with Linda and the kids. The other attendants receive their yellow cord, but not Tina who did not perform the studio's five elementary motions. Bob criticizes this and claims that Tina deserves the cord. They later get into another fight at 4:30 as Bob is aware of his 'meeting'. Jairo frequently trips and embarrasses Bob during the fight, but Tina supports her father for getting beat up to defend her. Angry with Jairo, Tina quits and returns to the grill, enjoying her father-daughter time with Bob where he gives her yellow gloves. Bob tries to make Gene and Louise stay and work as well, until Louise points they're not on the schedule, and they leave for the pier to record the sounds of poking and slapping a dead seal.

Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club, gave the episode C+, saying \\"This episode was also weaker overall than most of the previous Bob's Burgers. Bob going and confronting the capoeira instructor while skipping his 4:30 “meeting” causes some laughs, both in its dancing-around-the-meeting issue and in its outright hammering home of its poop jokes.

The film asks the question: \\"What is wrong with the world, and what can we do about it?\\", and explores Shadyac's personal journey after a bicycle accident in 2007 which led him to the answers \\"the nature of humanity\\", \\"the world's ever-growing addiction to materialism\\", and \\"human connections\\" Shot with Shadyac and a team of four, the film contrasts sharply with the director's most notable comedic works. Background Tom Shadyac suffered post-concussion syndrome after a bicycle accident in Virginia in 2007, experiencing months of acute headaches, hyper-sensitivity to light and noise, and slept in a closet due to chronic tinnitus that lasted beyond a six- month period. It was this constant ringing that the doctors could not treat that led him to suicidal thoughts. The injury followed the cumulative effects of previous mild head injuries Shadyac had suffered surfing, mountain biking and playing basketball. In 2011, a New York Times article stated that \\"the symptoms of a concussion [didn't] go away. Something as simple as a trip to the grocery store was painful for Shadyac, whose brain was unable to filter various stimuli. Shadyac subsequently gave away his excess fortune, opening a homeless shelter in Charlottesville, Virginia and making a key donation to Telluride, Colorado's effort to set aside a natural area at the town's entrance. He reoriented and simplified his life, sold his Los Angeles mansion and moved into a trailer park - albeit the exclusive Paradise Cove park in Malibu. As medical treatments failed to help, he isolated himself completely, sleeping in his closet and walling the windows of his mobile home with black- out curtains. Later, as his symptoms finally began to subside, the director wanted to share his inner quest in the way he knew best: through film.\\" Shadyac likened the experience to Dante's Seventh Circle of Hell. Film context In the film, Shadyac conducts interviews with scientists, religious leaders, environmentalists and philosophers including Desmond Tutu, Noam Chomsky, Lynne McTaggart, Elisabet Sahtouris, David Suzuki, Howard Zinn, and Thom Hartmann. The film asks two central questions: What’s Wrong With the World? and What Can We Do About it?. It is about \\"human connectedness, happiness, and the human spirit\\", and explores themes including Darwinism, Western mores, loneliness, the economy, and the drive to war. The documentary includes animated scenes explaining scientific concepts, as well as clips from the films Wall Street and It's a Wonderful Life. Proceeds from the documentary went to the Foundation for I Am, which supports various charities. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 36% based on 47 reviews, with an average rating of 5.16/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"I Am is undeniably well-meaning - and unfortunately proof that a filmmaker's best intentions aren't enough to guarantee a worthwhile viewing experience.\\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 38 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". The Los Angeles Times said the film was \\"a collection of sound bites that validate the filmmaker's point of view. What lifts the film above its dubious boilerplate assemblage of talking heads and archival images is Shadyac himself. With his gentle, self-mocking humor, he comes across as an exceptionally mellow, earnest and likable guy.\\" Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film a mixed review, awarding the film two stars out of four and stating that \\"the film is often absurd and never less than giddy with uplift, but that's not to say it's bad. I watched with an incredulous delight, and at the end, I liked Tom Shadyac quite a lot...he offers us this hopeful if somewhat undigested cut of his findings, in a film as watchable as a really good TV commercial, and just as deep. \\" See also * Materialism (economic) * Materialism (physical) References External links 2010 films Documentary films about spirituality American documentary films American films English-language films Films directed by Tom Shadyac 2010 documentary films Autobiographical documentary films 2010 LGBT-related films Documentary films about LGBT topics Desmond Tutu Noam Chomsky Films with screenplays by Tom Shadyac ","title":"I Am (2010 American documentary film)"},{"id":"31527745","text":"Briggs & Stratton Vanguard V-twin engine in a portable generator A small engine is the general term for a wide range of small-displacement, low-powered internal combustion engines used to power lawn mowers, generators, concrete mixers and many other machines that require independent power sources. These engines often have simple designs, for example an air-cooled single-cylinder petrol engine with a pull-cord starter, capacitor discharge ignition and a gravity-fed carburettor. Engines of similar design and displacement are also used in smaller vehicles such as motorcycles, motor scooters, all-terrain vehicles, and go-karts.  Characteristics  The engines are small in both physical dimensions and power output, relative to larger automobile engines. Power outputs are typically less than . The smallest of all are used in handheld garden machinery, such as string trimmers and chainsaws, which have a displacement as small as . Production cost is often a key consideration for small engines, resulting in relatively simple designs (compared with automotive engines, for example). The most common configuration is a single- cylinder engines that is air-cooled. The combustion cycle can be either two- stroke (which results in a lighter engine for a given power output) or four- stroke (which produce lower levels of exhaust gas emissions). The fuel is usually either petrol or diesel.One-cylinder Diesel engines In 1973, a small Wankel (rotary) engine manufactured by NSU was used in a lawn mower.\\"Now You Can 'Mow' with a Wankel!\\" Popular Science, July 1973 p. 18  Design  = Electrical system = When a manual starter system is used (such as a recoil starter with a pull-cord), only a basic electrical system is required, since the system's only purpose was to power the spark plug. Older engines used a magneto to achieve this, while newer engines often use a capacitor discharge ignition (CDI) system with an ignition coil. These systems do not require a battery or charging system. Before the invention of the recoil starter, a notched pulley was attached to the engine's flywheel; the operator would manually wind a rope around the pulley then jerk the rope to rotate the engine so that it would start. Following the introduction of the sprag clutch in the 1960s, the \\"impulse\\" or \\"wind-up\\" starter was popular for a brief period. These used a heavy spring which the operator placed under tension using a rotating crank handle. However, these systems were potentially dangerous as it was possible to leave the starter wound up and ready to start the engine unintentionally, even long after the crank was wound up. Electric starting, which has become more common over time, requires a more complex electrical system. These engines also require a starter motor, a battery to power it and an alternator to keep a battery charged. =Fuel system= Petrol engines often use simple fuel systems consisting of a float-type carburetor with a fuel tank located above it (so that the fuel is delivered by gravity, avoiding the need for a fuel pump). Sometimes, the fuel tank is located below the carburettor and fuel is delivered using engine vacuum or crankcase pressure pulsations. Diesel engines use fuel injection. =Governor= Most small engines use a governor to maintain a constant engine speed under varying loads. Some engines also have a mechanism for the user to adjust the engine speed. Rather than directly controlling the opening of the carburetor throttle, this is usually achieved by adjusting the governor, which in turn regulates the engine speed higher or lower. = Valvetrain = The most common design is an overhead valve configuration, as used by the Honda GX range since the 1980s for example. A sidevalve configuration is used instead by some engines, owing to its simplicity for both manufacture and basic maintenance. Some engines in recent years, for example the Honda GC series, now use an overhead cam configuration. =Crankshaft= Small engines can have the crankshaft oriented either horizontally or vertically, according to the intended application. Vertical axis engines were originally developed for rotary lawnmowers, but the size of this large market has encouraged a supply of cheap engines and they are now also used for other purposes such as generators.  Manufacturers  The six largest manufacturers of small engines for power equipment in 2014 were Honda, Briggs & Stratton, Kohler, Generac, Subaru and Kawasaki.  Repairs/maintenance  The repairing of small engines in a vocational occupation. While often touted as a separate job by commercial education institutions, it may also be a skill someone uses as part of a larger job, such as rancher or park ranger. Various safety precautions need to be taken when working on small engines.  See also  * Motorcycle engine * Non-road engine * Article on Small SI Engines.

He was baptized \\"Peter\\" in honor of his grandfather, Boutros Ibrahim Hilal. He had three brothers, Ghanem (December 16, 1931 Cairo – September 17, 1998 of Plymouth, MN), Adel (September 29, 1935 Cairo – August 18, 2016 of Golden Valley, MN), and Fayiz (July 11, 1940, Cairo – August 1, 1915, Poughkeepsie, NY), and a sister Hoda (of Greenwich, CT). The family was Melkite Catholic. Sadek was born into a medical family with a tradition of community service. His father, Dr. Kamil Boutros Hilal, was part of a humanitarian mission sent to Adana, Turkey during the Adana Massacres of Armenian Christians in 1909, and was a founding member of the Alumni Association of the American University of Beirut Medical School. Sadek followed his father's footsteps into a medical career. He attended the French Jesuit College de Sainte Familie in Cairo for his primary and secondary education, and received his Medical Degree from Cairo University. While attending Cairo University, Sadek had to hide his Christianity from his professors by omitting his grandfather's name and using his great- grandfather's instead; going by Sadek Kamil Ibrahim Hilal rather than Sadek Kamil Boutros Hilal. As fair, blue-eyed Christians of Syrian and Lebanese descent, the family faced regular discrimination from Egyptian society and institutions. When the Egyptian government of Gamal Abdul Nasser began persecuting Christians in the late 1950s, the family decided to fulfill their late father Kamel's dream of immigrating to the United States. Sadek arrived in the United States first, and was accepted into the radiology Ph.D. program at the University of Minnesota. Brothers Ghanem \\"George\\", Adel \\"Marc\\", and Fayiz; sister Hoda \\"Mimi\\", and mother Alice joined Sadek in Minnesota after short stays in Brooklyn and Endicott, NY. Adel and Fayiz joined Sadek in studying at the University of Minnesota, where Adel earned a Master of Electrical Engineering and Fayiz earned a Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering. Ghanem and Marc spent their careers working for IBM, Control Data Systems, and Honeywell and its successor companies: Alliant TechSystems and Orbital ATK. Fayiz was a businessman and philanthropist, founder of Cetek Technologies, a high-tech ceramics manufacturer. Hoda was a master Librarian in Greenwich. Dr. Hilal married Cynthia Ann Tutundgy on June 28, 1964. She was a guidance counselor at a parochial school in Brooklyn. They had three sons and a daughter, and lived in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. The children are Paul, Philip, and twins, Drs. Peter Hilal and Diane Hilal Campo. Kamil, sometimes spelled Kamel, is a patronymic middle name. An Arabic speaker understands \\"Sadek Kamil Hilal\\" to mean \\"Sadek, son of Kamil Hilal\\". Career He received his medical degree from the Cairo University School of Medicine in 1955 and earned a doctorate in radiology from the University of Minnesota in 1962. His thesis entitled, The Measurement of Blood Flow by Radiologic Technique, became one of the most frequently cited references in the field, according to the journal Radiology. Columbia University recruited him in 1963 as an assistant professor and assisting attending radiologist. He then became the director of Columbia's division of radiology and was a professor of radiology and neurological surgery at the College of Physicians and Surgeons from 1979 until his emeritus status four years before his death. At his death in 2000, age 70, he was president of the International Society of Neuroradiology, a position he held since 1998. In 1968, he developed the technique of embolization, a way to treat malformations of blood vessels in the brain by injecting substances to occlude them.

Directed by Thomas N. Heffron, it starred John Barrymore as a young husband who pretends to join the Masons as an excuse to get out of the house. It was based on a 1901 play by Leo Ditrichstein.The AFI Catalog of Feature Films:Are You a Mason? This film is presumed lost. Plot summary Frank Perry discovers that his wife desires him to become a Mason. Taking advantage of the opportunity, Perry goes out for several nights to carouse and have fun while telling his wife that he is undergoing initiation at the Masonic lodge. When his wife invites her father, a Grand Master of the Masons, for a visit, Frank goes to comedic lengths to avoid being found out. The farce is magnified by the circumstance that his father-in-law has also been lying about his Masonic association. Cast Production The film was based on a 1901 farce by Leo Ditrichstein, who in turn adapted it from a German play, Die Logenbrüder (The Freemason), by Curt Kraatz and Carl Laufs. Are You a Mason? was Barrymore's third feature-length film as well as his third film under contract to Famous Players.

In Moving Picture World, reviewer Lynde Denig also liked the picture and thought that Barrymore improved on his earlier good performances. The Variety reviewer was unimpressed, describing it as \\"a decidedly mild comedy\\" and saying that it had \\"innumerable opportunities for comedy situations, most of which have been sadly neglected\\"; the reviewer went on to credit Barrymore with whatever laughs the film was able to deliver.

The main focus of the congress was to introduce economic, social, and political reforms in order to modernize the country's socialist system. The Congress also elected Raúl Castro as First Secretary, the position vacant since Fidel Castro's stepping down in 2006. Background The Party hadn't convened since 1997, when Cuba's economy was undergoing a severe depression, known as the Special Period. Nevertheless, no significant economic reforms emerged during the Fifth Congress. The 6th Congress had been scheduled for 2009, but was postponed due to the global economic crisis. On November 9, 2010 the Draft Guidelines of the Economic and Social Policy of the Party and the Revolution were released, followed by a period of public discussions and consultations between December 1, 2010 to February 28, 2011. According to the Cuban government, 8.9 million people were involved in this phase, resulting in changes to 68% of the guidelines and increasing their number from 291 to 311. Organization The congress was opened on April 16 with a large military parade in Havana, commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of thwarting the Bay of Pigs Invasion. It was followed by the President of Cuba and the party's Second Secretary Raúl Castro's presentation of the Central Report. In terms of economics, some of the key notes include proposal to gradually abolish the practice of distributing subsidized goods by means of rationing, blamed for hoarding and providing disincentive to work, while firmly rejecting the idea of a shock therapy. Concerning the non-strategic parts of the economy, Castro talked about the benefits of reducing the role of the public sector, as well as of decentralization and deregulation. The speech also addressed the need for political reforms, including the suggestion to limit those holding high political offices to two five-year terms in order to rejuvenate the country's institutions. On April 17 – 18, 997 delegates, representing some 800,000 party members, divided into five commissions, debated on the Draft Economic and Social Guidelines and approved the Central Report. On April 19, the delegates approved 313 guidelines from the Draft, having modified 86 and added 2. Raúl Castro was elected to be the party's First Secretary, while the position of the Second Secretary went to José Ramón Machado Ventura, Cuba's First Vice President. Members of the Central Committee, Secretariat, and the Politburo were elected as well, while the size of the latter was reduced from 24 to 15 members. During the closing ceremony- attended by Fidel Castro, making a rare appearance- Raúl Castro expressed satisfaction with the results of the Congress, stating that the reforms are to be gradually implemented over a five-year period.

On 1 December 2004 he helped raise the Morning Star flag at a ceremony in Jayapura, for which he was charged with treason and given a fifteen-year prison sentence. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have protested on his behalf, the former designating him a prisoner of conscience. He was released on 19 November 2015. Background Born in 1959 in Jayapura, Papua, Karma was raised in an upper-class family active in local politics. His father, Andreas Karma, was a civil servant educated by the Dutch who had continued to work in the Indonesian government after independence, serving as a regent of Wamena, and Constant Karma, one of Filep Karma's cousin, served as deputy governor of Papua. Filep Karma was influenced as a child by a midnight raid on his home by Indonesian soldiers who broke the family's furniture. He later studied at Sebelas Maret University for a time in Solo, Java which he earning undergraduate degree and becoming a civil servant like his father. In 1997, he traveled to Manila to study for a year at the Asian Institute of Management. He was unable to finish his studies. Karma has two children. Flag-raisings and prison terms The Morning Star flag, used by supporters of Papuan independence When Karma returned from Manila, he found Java engulfed in protests against President Suharto. He became involved in the movement and began advocating the secession of Papua from Indonesia. On 2 July 1998, he led a ceremony to raise the West Papuan flag in Biak, following which, activists clashed with police, resulting in injuries to a dozen officers. The Indonesian military occupied Biak Island four days later and fired on the activists; Karma has alleged that more than 100 protesters were killed and buried on nearby islands, though a precise death toll is unknown. Human Rights Watch protested the Indonesian government's actions, noting that in the months that followed, it \\"continuously failed to carry out a serious investigation of these incidents, or hold accountable the perpetrators of abuses against the people in Biak\\". Karma himself was wounded in both legs by rubber bullets. He was then arrested, tried, and sentenced to six-and-a-half years' imprisonment for treason; the sentence was overturned on appeal after Karma had been in prison for ten months. On 1 December 2004, he participated in a second flag-raising ceremony, marking the anniversary of Papuan independence from the Dutch. Indonesian security forces were again alleged to have fired into the crowd, killing pro-independence activists, and Karma was again arrested on charges of treason against the Indonesian state, this time along with fellow activist Yusak Pakage. At Karma's trial, the judge mocked his Christian beliefs and gave him triple the sentence that the prosecution had requested. Karma is serving this fifteen-year sentence in Abepura Prison in Jayapura. Pakage was imprisoned on a ten-year sentence, which he served until early release in 2010. After the trial, Karma's lawyers reportedly found a dog's severed head on their doorstep accompanied by a note reading \\"Kill Karma\\". Reports of abuse and international attention In August 2008, 40 members of the US Congress sent a letter to Indonesia calling for Pakage and Karma's release, in response to which a 100-person rally protested in front of the US Embassy in Jakarta. In 2009, the Asian Human Rights Commission stated that guards had beaten Karma for returning late from a prison leave on 1 February, breaking his glasses and tearing one of his eyelids. In 2010, Karma was allowed to give an interview to a local radio station, in which he stated that he had been regularly abused by prison authorities: \\"I have been punched, kicked, pulled. But what hurts more is the mental torture we are subjected to.\\" A spokesman for Indonesia's Foreign Ministry responded to the BBC News that \\"allegations of prisoner abuse were always investigated and dealt with properly.\\" In May 2010, prison officials denied the request of Karma's doctors to take him to Jakarta for proper medical treatment, and Amnesty International again issued an alert for his safety. In December 2010, Karma was transferred to a Jayapura police station following a riot at the prison, causing Human Rights Watch to reiterate its call for him and his fellow political prisoners to be freed, and to protest his lack of access to legal counsel. He was soon transferred back to Abepura Prison. Amnesty International issued another alert on Karma's behalf in April 2012, when the organization alleged that prison officials were refusing to provide him medical treatment for a possible tumor. He received treatment in September of that year.

As an invasive species, Daphnia lumholtzi disrupts aquatic habitats by spreading throughout the warmer waters of lakes and reservoirs. Description Daphnia lumholtzi is a small crustacean that is 2–3 mm in length. It has a large helmet and a long tailspine, usually longer than the length of its body, that fluctuates in size. Its body structure is arched, extending to a sharp point. There are roughly 10 prominent spines on the margin of the abdominal shield covering. Ecology =Temperature= D. lumholtzi is typically found in the warm, shallow regions of bodies of water with larger surface areas. While most species of Daphnia see high mortality at temperatures greater than 25 °C, D. lumholtzi individuals can survive and reproduce at temperatures up to 30 °C, with a thermal optimum occurring at 29 °C. Studies have shown that population density and water surface temperature are positively correlated. Once favorable temperatures are reached, such as those in the late summer, the previously deposited eggs hatch. The lower temperature range of D. lumholtzi extends to 5 °C, where some individuals are able to survive, with survival increasing significantly at 10 °C and reproduction beginning to occur at 15 °C. This significantly broad temperature range in which D. lumholtzi can survive has led to it being labeled a eurythermal species. =Behavior= Both adult and juvenile D. lumholtzi exhibit a vertical migration pattern, moving upward as the sun sets and downward as the sun rises. This behavior leads to large population densities close to the water surface at night and also occurs in the absence of a suggested predator threat. =Diet= Daphnia lumhotzi mostly feeds on phytoplankton ranging from 1 to 25 micrometers in size, but will also eat foods that contain organic detritus, bacteria, and protists which provide an excellent source of nutrients. =Dispersal= Daphnia lumholtzi was originally restricted to the tropical lake and pond regions of southwest Asia, Australia, and most of Africa. The exact location of geographic origin in the United States has not been identified, but scientists believe the introduction of exotic African fish to lakes most likely caused the distribution. It was first detected in Missouri and Texas reservoirs in 1991 and has since been found in more than 16 states and over 125 lakes and reservoirs. Studies have shown that the ability of D. lumholtzi to disperse widely is most likely due to human activity. Heavy boat traffic on lakes and reservoirs during warmer seasons when D. lumholtzi thrive enable them to expand into other nearby bodies of water. The long spines and hairs on eggs act as hooks and enable attachment to boats, facilitating dispersal. The presence of D. lumholtzi in smaller ponds is atypical; however it is unlikely that non-human dispersal mechanisms, such as smaller invertebrates moving between bodies of water, have contributed to its widespread distribution. =Reproduction= D. lumholtzi deposits eggs in lake sediment that can remain dormant for long periods of time. The eggs are characterized by long spines and hairs that act as hooks. Ephippia are protective shells that cover the egg until favorable conditions occur, such as warmer temperatures or a larger amount of resources. These ephippia are able to survive in environmental conditions, including oxygen, salinity, and temperature ranges, that are inhospitable to adult daphnids, although exact ranges for D. lumholtzi ephippia have not been found. This ephippia stage is an example of diapause, a state of suspended animation an organism can enter in order to survive a harsh environment. D. lumholtzi is capable of producing 10 times more ephippia than other daphnid species. In temperatures above the optimal temperature for reproduction, 25 °C, the rate of egg development decreases. In temperatures below 25 °C, egg development slows. =Predators= The main predators of D. lumholtzi are fish and small invertebrate species. Larger fish are almost always successful in their encounters with D. lumholtzi. Small invertebrate predators are less efficient than large fish in catching D. lumholtzi.  Physiology  Being an invasive species, the physiology of D. lumholtzi is relatively well studied for a daphnid. = Respiration = D. lumholtzi individuals prefer areas with high levels of dissolved oxygen and avoid areas where oxygen levels are low. Population surveys have found robust D. lumholtzi populations in water with oxygen saturation levels ranging from 65-163%, while no populations were found in water with saturation levels ranging from 7-50%. The mechanism D. lumholtzi uses for respiration is very similar to that used by other species of Daphnia, with gas exchange occurring through gills that are fed oxygenated water by appendages on the thorax. = Response to salinity = As with most other members of the order Cladocera, D. lumholtzi lives in freshwater and is hyperosmotic to its environment. D. lumholtzi is generally found in habitats with a salinity near 0 grams per liter, but can withstand slightly saline water, up to 1.5 grams per liter, for short amounts of time. This ability to survive short bouts of salinity has likely contributed to D. lumholtzi’s ability to invade North America. As an invasive species D. lumholtzi exhibits higher survivorship and reproduction in the late summer, under high heat conditions, when compared to other crustaceans living in these conditions. It has been suggested that D. lumholtzi’s more tropical origins may have enabled it to live in these higher temperatures due to evolutionary changes that resulted in enzymes that are better adapted to the heat. This advantage allows them to be a better competitor and ultimately out-compete other species, specifically native zooplankton species, within the same habitat and come out as a successful invader. In accordance with the competitive exclusion principle, no other species can inhabit the same late summer niche as D. lumholtzi; another factor that allows it to have higher survivorship than other Daphnia species and is ultimately a better invader. It is important to note, however, that high survivorship and reproduction are not the only factors that make D. lumholtzi an invasive species. Competition between D. lumholtzi is increased in habitats that favor the high light intensity of shallow waters. D. lumholtzi showed greater survivorship than other Daphnia species (specifically D. pulex), which made them a stronger competitor for light reception and resources in bodies of water receiving high light intensity. It was found to out-compete other species in areas with high light intensity which in turn contributes to its invasive success. D. lumholtzi is capable of producing 10 times more ephippia than other daphnid species, which can remain dormant until favorable conditions occur. This egg bank gives them an advantage over other species whose eggs cannot withstand desiccation or lower temperatures, enabling them to produce more offspring that survive longer. The reproductive rate also increases with a higher concentration of food. Areas exhibiting high food abundance will therefore attract more D. lumholtzi, and in turn result in a higher rate of reproduction. The greater number of offspring puts pressure on the habitat’s resources and other competitors. D. lumholtzi is highly plastic, meaning it has the ability to morphologically adapt to factors within the environment by developing structures that enable it to successfully avoid predation. A long tail spine, large helmet, and additional spines on the abdomen are produced in response to predator kairomones, which are predator hormones, within the water. D. lumholtzi does not produce these protective structures when there are no predators present, and looks morphologically similar to other Daphnia species. When predators are detected, D. lumholtzi responds by producing a tail spine, helmet, abdomen spines for protection; other Daphnia species do not adapt this way to predator threats. With the development of these morphological features, predators have a more difficult time preying on D. lumholtzi. This excess energy the predators put into eating D. lumholtzi lessens predator efficiency, making the predators more likely to choose another prey. This prey-switching puts an extra strain on other native zooplankton species, reducing predation on D. lumholtzi and allowing it to outperform other competitors. Control Eradication of D. lumholtzi is almost impossible once it has invaded a lake or reservoir. D. lumholtzi is sensitive to various pesticides and manmade chemicals, but the introduction of chemicals to natural lakes is often harmful to other species. The focus of most control measures is the prevention of initial invasion. For now, scientists recommend simple practices, such as thorough cleaning of boats and avoiding aquarium water dumps, to slow the spread of the species.

Due to the country's large landmass, many climates are experienced including equatorial, tropical, subtropical, desert, monsoonal, temperate, and alpine. These differing climates influence Australia's snake distribution and abundance, and provide many different and unique habitats for them. Western Australia 80% of Western Australia falls into the desert or semi-arid climate section meaning that it receives no more than a foot of rainfall all year long. The soil is not rich in nutrients and over half of the days are sunny with no clouds. There is a large variety of snakes in this area. The highest temperature ever recorded here is 123 degrees Fahrenheit and averages are in the 80's (F) and 90's (F) during more than half of the year. Because of these hot temperature the snake habitats in Western Australia are mostly out in the open. They enjoy soaking up the sun since they are not warm blooded. It is a wrong belief that snakes are cold blooded. They are actually 'poikilothermis', meaning that they cannot control their body temperature and depend upon external sources to stay warm. Habitats are typically on top of rocks or out on the desert sand area that cover most of this province. Several species of snakes can also be found in the grassy expanses surrounding wetlands and lakes in the wetter south west region of the state. Northern Territory The Northern Territory is located to the northeast of Western Australia. Here the climate ranges from desert to tropical. This wide climate variety is accompanied by a wide variety of snakes making use of the different habitats. The highest recorded temperature in this region is 48.3 degrees Celsius and averages are around 26 degrees Celsius year round. The further south in the province you go the cooler it is, and record lows such as -7.5 degrees Celsius have been recorded in the arid inland desert. MacLeay's water snake is a largely nocturnal species that is typically found in coastal Northern Territory. The water snakes spend most of their time in or near water where they feed; they will only leave to bask in the sun or breed. They are found mostly in freshwater lagoons, swamps and creeks and can also be found sheltering in vegetation near water. Their range increases markedly during wet season flooding. Their most defining characteristic is their stout bodies and strongly keeled scales. In terms of breeding, water snakes are viviparous which means that they give birth to up to 15 live offspring instead of laying eggs. They are a mildly venomous species with rear-facing fangs.http://www- public.jcu.edu.au/discovernature/herps/JCUDEV_009968 Queensland Western Brown Snake Located on the east coast, Queensland is the second largest state and has a wide range of climates due to its vast size. The coastal area is very humid and warm year round with the dry season being in the winter. The inland section of the state is dominated by grassland. The majority of the snakes found in Queensland are in the north of the state where there is tropical rainforest, which provides dense vegetation for the snakes to shelter in, and a wide variety of forest animals for them to prey upon. Snakes also inhabit natural caves and soft soil near cliffs, where there are ample sunny rocks for them to bake on during the day. The snakes are also capable of digging themselves into the soil. The Eastern brown snake is a species that is found in Queensland. The snake is named after its predominating color, however colour can range from uniform tan to grey or dark brown. The belly is cream, yellow or pale orange with darker orange spots. This species is a slender, small headed member of the cobra family. They are alert, fast moving, and highly venomous. Being very active during the day time, they feed on small lizards, mice, and ground dwelling birds. South Australia To the south of the Northern Territory is South Australia. This state is mainly temperate with occasional desert areas. Sand dunes are common breeding grounds for snakes of this region. Most of the venomous tend to be in this area. This is because it receives large amounts of sun but at the same time allows for enough cover for protection. The Tiger snake is a species that represent South Australia. They usually have striped markings hence their name; the markings can also change due to the seasons and the age of the snakes. They are very territorial, so they will live in the same place for years, and are found in a broad range of habitats including suburbs. Because of the fact they are territorial their habitats remain the same and they do not move around for any reason. For diet, these snakes feed on all types of creatures such as frogs, small fish, and other mammals. New South Wales New South Wales is the central state on the east coast of Australia. This region surrounds the Australian Capital Territory) where the nation's capital Canberra is located. Most of the state is in a temperate climate zone which is not very conducive to snakes that need extended periods of heat in order to survive. NSW has large mountain ranges, and snow is present during the coldest winter months. Snakes are not found in the snowy regions, and are most common in the rural bushland which is interspersed with agricultural areas. CommonTreeSnake The Common Tree Snake is found in multiple provinces in Australia including New South Wales. Something unique about these snakes is that they stiffen in the shape of a beam to cross from branch to branch. Commonly hiding among the vines such as ivy, they are able to blend well with their habitat. They have a tiny head, and thin foreparts; however, they can reach up to 1.8 metres in length. They prey on birds, arboreal lizards, and frogs. Victoria This state experiences a temperate climate and has a large coastal area. Fewer snakes are present than in warmer states, for snakes prefer a warmer and sunnier environment where they can bask. Being poikilothermic, they depend heavily upon external heat for survival. The white-lipped snake is one of few species that is able to survive in the cold highland regions on Victoria. Its preferred habitat is tussock grass or sedge fields where the small snake finds shelter under logs or dense vegetation. Since the habitat is so frigid, its oviparous characteristic is very remarkable; the snake's small size and secretive habits most likely play a role in its survival under such conditions. Although these harsh conditions do not have much of an impact on the snake's eggs, it does affect its fecundity by limiting reproduction to every 2 to 3 years.

The first known printed book in Spanish Philippines was a Chinese language catechism using the Chinese method of printing, produced by the non-Christian Chinese printer Keng Yong in Manila under commission from the Spanish branch of the Order of Preachers.National Historical Institute (1991) p.iv The Spanish historian Carlos Sanz believes that this catechism, Doctrina Christiana en letra y lengua China, compuesta por los padres ministros de los Sangleyes, de la Orden de Sancto Domingo. Con licencia, por Keng yong, China, en el parian de Manila (\\"Christian Doctrine in the Chinese Letter and Language, composed by the minister fathers to the Sangleys, of the Order of Saint Dominic.

Background The Chinese method of preparing block prints \\"was used in Manila by the early printers.\\" \\"The wooden block\\" was \\"probably made of batikulíng or a similar wood.\\" \\"The Chinese printer usually held in his right hand two brushes at the opposite extremities of the same handle; with one he inked the face of the characters and, the paper being then laid on the block, he ran the dry brush over it so as to take the impression. This was done with such speed that one man could finish a couple of thousand copies in a day.\\" National Historical Institute (1991) p.ix The implication is that Keng Yong was an established printer in the Chinese quarter, and that the Chinese had been printing in Manila for some time using the traditional Chinese wooden block method, perhaps since before the establishment of the Spanish East Indies. Since the first known book printed under Spanish ecclesiastical authority was Keng Yong's printing probably between 1590 and 1592, the suggestion that the Spanish introduced printing to the Philippines has no basis in historical fact.

Much of her career was spent in France and in Australia, where she was associated with the movement known as the Heidelberg School. Life Ethel Carrick was born in Uxbridge, Middlesex, to Emma (Filmer) Carrick and Albert William Carrick, a draper. She trained in London at the Guildhall School of Music and at the Slade School of Fine Art under Henry Tonks (ca. 1898-1903). She married the Australian Impressionist painter Emanuel Phillips Fox in 1905. They moved to Paris, where they remained until 1913. She travelled widely in Europe, North Africa, and the South Pacific (e.g. Tahiti) during this period and made trips to Australia in 1908 and 1913. The outbreak of World War I brought Carrick and her husband to Melbourne, Australia, where they did organizing work to raise war funds from artists and to support the French Red Cross. Emanuel died of cancer in 1915, and the following year Carrick began two decades of travels that took her through the Middle East, South Asia (e.g. India), and Europe. She returned intermittently to Australia to exhibit her work and go out on painting expeditions around the country. In the 1920s, she was recommended by the Académie de la Grande Chaumière in Paris as a private teacher of still life painting, and she counted a number of Australians and Americans in Paris among her students. She died in Melbourne in 1952. Art career and critical estimation Paris. Flower market. 1907. National Gallery of Victoria Untitled (Royal Avenue, Versailles), c.1909. Castlemaine Art Gallery and Historical Museum Mainly a painter, Carrick is known for her flower paintings, landscapes and scenes of outdoor urban life in parks and on beaches. Some of these draw on her international travels, such as her paintings of outdoor markets in the Middle East and elsewhere. In the 1920s, she began painting flower studies, which overall are more conventional than her earlier work. In the 1930s, she created some lithographs, and during World War II, which she spent in Australia, she painted some scenes of women war workers. Carrick began as an Impressionist plein air painter but fairly quickly moved to a more Post-Impressionist style featuring blockier compositions and sharper color contrasts. Some of the works produced around 1911-12 are distinctly Fauvist in their strong colors, high abstraction, and loose handling of the paint. Her canvases of urban life tend to be dense with human activity and feature patches of vibrant color. Carrick first showed her work in London in 1903. She exhibited at the Paris Salon d'Automne (from 1906 on), the London Royal Academy of Arts, the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts (from 1906 on), and various progressive galleries in Melbourne and Sydney, Australia (from 1908 on). In addition to her own solo and group exhibitions, she was in dual shows with her husband at the Melbourne Athenaeum in 1914 and again in 1944. In 1911, she became sociétaire of the Salon d'Automne, and she served as a jury member from 1912 to around 1925, both unusual positions for women to hold and marks of the high regard in which she was held by the Paris art world. Prior to World War I, she also served as the vice-president of the International Union of Women Artists. Late in her career, in the 1940s and 1950s, she exhibited with the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors. In her lifetime, Carrick's reputation was eclipsed by her husband's, in part because she spent a good deal of her time promoting his career rather than her own, lobbying Australian collectors and curators to buy his work and arranging exhibitions both while he was alive and posthumously. In recent years, her reputation has been rising, and critics today consider her work more adventurous than that of her husband. In 1996, one of her paintings set an auction record of A$105,500 (since surpassed) for works by Australian women artists, and the following year saw the publication of a biography, Ethel Carrick Fox: Travels and Triumphs of a Post- Impressionist by art historian Susanna de Vries. In 1993, the Waverley City Gallery in Melbourne held the exhibition \\"Capturing the Orient: Hilda Rix Nicholas & Ethel Carrick in the East\\", and in 2011, the Queensland Art Gallery held a joint retrospective of the work of Carrick and her husband.

These conflicts were separate from the Argentine War of Independence (1810 — 1820), though they first arose during this period. The main antagonists were, on a geographical level, Buenos Aires Province against the other provinces of modern Argentina, and on a political level, the Federal Party against the Unitarian Party. The central cause of the conflict was the excessive centralism advanced by Buenos Aires leaders and, for a long period, the monopoly on the use of the Port of Buenos Aires as the sole means for international commerce.

Wagner was born in Linz, and studied in Linz and Munich. In 1947, she made her debut at the Vienna State Opera. Two years later, she was hired by Wilhelm Furtwängler to sing in The Magic Flute at the Salzburg Festival. After this successful collaboration, Furtwängler signed her to sing Floßhilde and Grimgerde in Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen at La Scala. This was the beginning of a career that included many of Wagner's alto roles (she and the composer were not related). In 1950, Sieglinde Wagner sang as a contralto, as Orlovsky, a blase young nobleman in Die Fledermaus. In 1952, she made her first appearance at the Städtischen Oper in Berlin as Maddalena in Rigoletto. She sang Carmen there in December of the same year. This was the start of a 34-year relationship. Sieglinde Wagner had a very wide repertoire, including Clairon in Richard Strauss's Capriccio, Annina in Der Rosenkavalier, Magdalena in Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, Fenena in Nabucco, the mother in Hansel and Gretel and Mary in The Flying Dutchman. In 1963, she was awarded the title of Kammersänger by the senate of Berlin. She was active for many years at the festivals in Bayreuth, Edinburgh, Glyndebourne, and Salzburg under conductors such as Otto Klemperer, Wilhelm Furtwängler, Clemens Krauss, Fritz Busch, Karl Böhm, Herbert von Karajan, and Wolfgang Sawallisch. She made numerous recordings with illustrious casts, including The Magic Flute with Karl Böhm, Fritz Wunderlich, Roberta Peters, and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau. She retired from singing in 1986.

It is the owner of a Heritage railway , operated by the Indiana Transportation Museum, over former Norfolk Southern trackage from Tipton, Indiana, to Indianapolis, a distance of 37 miles (59.5 km). This trackage is the southernmost section of the former Indianapolis to Michigan City main line operated by several railroad companies since its original construction in the mid-19th Century, the best known being the Nickel Plate.  Overview  The HHPA was first established as the Historic Railroad Multi- Jurisdictional Port Authority (HRMJPA) in 1994, for the purpose of preserving this section of rail corridor that then-owner Norfolk Southern wished to abandon. In 1995, the HRMJPA closed on its purchase of these 37-miles of rail tracks, which are located in Hamilton County and two other Indiana counties. The following year, the City of Indianapolis (Marion County) joined in this entity and its name was changed to become the Hoosier Heritage Port Authority (HHPA). In 1997, the former NS interchange at Tipton was cut. The far southern section near 10th Street in Indianapolis had also been removed several years earlier. Additionally the interchange with the Indianapolis Belt Railroad where the tracks crossed the CSX double main line were removed by CSX inc. in the Spring of 2010. This leaves the system isolated from the national railroad system. As of 2011, only occasional tourist railway trains run along these tracks, such as the Indiana State Fair Train between Fishers and the State Fairgrounds (near 39th Street and Fall Creek in Indianapolis). However, one of the goals of the HHPA is to eventually establish a commuter rail system using this corridor although it is unlikely any action will be taken as the senate committee had passed a Mass Transit bill for Bus Rapid Transit and busway for the corridor.  Corridor history  This rail corridor, one of the oldest in Indiana, traces its heritage back to the Peru and Indianapolis Railroad Company, which was incorporated on January 19, 1846, to construct a rail line from downtown Indianapolis to the Wabash and Erie Canal at Peru. Construction began at Indianapolis in 1849, reaching Noblesville in 1851, Tipton in 1852, Kokomo in 1853, and finally reaching Peru in the spring of 1854. Reorganized as the Indianapolis, Peru & Chicago Railway Company (IP&C;) in 1864, that entity subsequently acquired the Chicago, Cincinnati and Louisville Railroad Company seven years later to complete a unified 161-mile (259 km) route between Indianapolis and Michigan City. The IP&C; was leased by the Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway in 1881, but upon that company's financial collapse five years later it was sold by that line's creditors to the Lake Erie & Western Railroad Company (LE&W;) in March 1887. By 1899, the LE&W; was under the control of the New York Central System (NYC). In 1923, the NYC sold the LE&W; to the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad, better known by its nickname, the Nickel Plate Road (NKP). On October 16, 1964, the Nickel Plate merged into the Norfolk and Western Railway (N&W;), which later became the Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) in 1982.

Although this is a fiction, there have been countless real reports of attacks by cephalopods since ancient times. A significant portion of these are unverifiable tabloid stories, or at least questionable. This article tries to collect these. Since some of the species in the stories are not always identifiable, the article deals generally with cephalopods. Cephalopods are members of the class Cephalopoda, which include all squid, octopuses, cuttlefish, and nautiluses. Some members of the group are capable of causing injury or even death to humans. Defenses =Tentacles= Tentacles are the major organs used by squid for defending and hunting. They are often confused with arms—octopuses have eight arms, while squid and cuttlefish have eight arms and two tentacles. These tentacles are generally longer than arms and typically have suckers only on their ends instead of along the entire length. The giant squid and colossal squid have some of the largest tentacles in the world, with suckers capable of producing suction forces more than ) and with pointed teeth at the tips. =Beak= A comparison of the size of a colossal squid beak and a human hand The cephalopod beak resembles that of a parrot. It is a tough structure made of chitin and marks the beginning of the cephalopod's digestive system. Colossal squid use their beaks for shearing and slicing prey's flesh to allow the pieces to travel the narrow esophagus. One of the largest beaks ever recorded was on a colossal squid. The beak had a lower rostral length of . Many beaks have also been discovered in the stomachs of sperm whales, as the stomach juices dissolve the soft flesh of the squid, leaving the hard beaks behind. The largest beak ever discovered this way had a lower rostral length of , indicating that the original squid was . =Venom= All octopodes have venom, but few are fatally dangerous. The greater blue- ringed octopus, however, is considered to be one of the most venomous animals known; the venom of one is enough to kill ten grown men. It uses the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin, which quickly causes respiratory arrest. Estimates of the number of recorded fatalities caused by blue-ringed octopuses vary, ranging from seven to sixteen deaths; most scholars agree that there are at least eleven. Attacks on humans = Common octopus = Common octopus * Alfred Brehm (1829–1884) in the 19th century was one of the most significant naturalists of the 20th century. In the section on the giant squid in his famous book, Animal World, he mentions: \\"Most of the data on these giant octopuses can be found in Montfort’s book, The Natural History of Mollusks. There is talk of a sea monster grabbing the mast of a ship off the coast of Angola with its arms and almost pulling the ship down into the abyss, on the occasion of which the lucky crew painted this great danger in a vow. in the chapel of St. Thomas of Maló. He further talks about another polyph in the wake of Montfort, Captain Dens; it pulled some sailors off the ship's rack with his arms near St. Ilona; the end of one arm, which was stuck in the rigging of the ship and which had been cut off, proved to be 25 feet long and had several rows of suction discs on it.\\" * American traveler Frederick O'Brien (1869–1932) reports during his research in the Marquises Islands that a relative of one of the locals was killed by a large octopus living in the coastal countryside.Frederick O'Brien: A haldokló szigetvilág, Dante Kiadás, Budapest, 1930s * An undetermined date (sometime in the early 20th century): a diver was attacked by a large octopus in the military port of Toulon. The diver almost drowned and lost consciousness. Luckily, the diver's companions were able to pull him out of the water and only there could he take the animal off of it. The octopus weighed about 60 kilograms and had legs 8 meters long.Leidenfrost Gyula: Keserű tenger, Franklin Társulat, Budapest, 1936, 82p * According to a certain Pernetti (\\"Voyage aux iles Malouines\\") off the coast of Angola, a huge 8-armed octopus climbed aboard. It was so severe that the ship capsized halfway. The rest of the story is unknown.Leidenfrost, 83p While octopuses generally avoid humans, attacks have occasionally been verified. For example, a Pacific octopus, said to be nearly perfectly camouflaged, \\"lunged\\" at a diver and \\"wrangled\\" over his camera. Another diver recorded the encounter on video. The supposed attack on a Staten Island ferry in New York, leading to the loss of the ferry and commemorated by a bronze sculpture (installed in 2016), never actually occurred, nor was there any such ferry disaster. The artist responsible admitted it was \\"a multimedia art project and social experience – not maliciously – about how gullible people are\\". In the 1960s, divers would willingly grapple octopuses in octopus wrestling, a then- popular sport in coastal United States. = Giant Pacific octopus = Giant Pacific octopus * In another part of \\"River Monsters\\", in \\"Terror in Paradise\\" Jeremy Wade reports that a fisherman has been attacked by a giant octopus on the North American coast of the Pacific Ocean.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3L8U3kllj_s = Giant or colossal squid = * The French ship Ville de Paris participated in the American War of Independence.

He also mentions a case in which an English ship sank in World War II, with the few survivors being able to cling to a small raft in which not everyone could fit. The first night, a giant squid attacked them and dragged a companion down into the deep.

The animal tried unsuccessfully to grip the ship with his tentacles before being killed by the propellers.Michael Bright, There are Giants in the Sea, 1989 The story was validated by Commander Arne Groenningsaeter of the Royal Norwegian Navy, stating that the ship had not one, but three encounters with giant squids between 1930 and 1933.Robert Hendrickson, The Ocean Almanac, 1992 * A giant squid allegedly attacked a raft with survivors from the Britannia in 1941, which had been sunk in the South Atlantic.

Berger, Ocean: Reflections on a Century of Exploration but in 1956, Cox himself contacted writer Frank W. Lane to tell his story. They required marine naturalist John Cloudsley- Thompson to examine Cox's scars at Birkbeck College, and the former further validated the story, assuring the marks, of 1-1/4 inches in size, belonged to a 23-feet long squid.Michael Bright, Man-Eaters: Horrifying True Stories of Savage, Flesh-Eating Predators... and their Human Prey!, 2013, St. Martin's Publishing Group, 9781466859692Bernard Heuvelmans, Kraken & The Colossal OctopusMysterious World, episode \\"Monsters of the Deep\\", 1978 The story has been called the only substantiated report of a giant squid killing humans. * In 2003, the crew of a yacht competing to win the round-the-world Jules Verne Trophy reported being attacked by a giant squid several hours after departing from Brittany, France. The squid purportedly latched onto the ship and blocked the rudder with two tentacles. Olivier de Kersauson (captain of the yacht) then stopped the boat, causing the squid to lose interest. \\"We didn't have anything to scare off this beast, so I don't know what we would have done if it hadn't let go,\\" Kersauson said. =Humboldt squid= Humboldt squid * Humboldt squid are notorious for their aggression. In Mexico, they are known as diablo rojo (Spanish for 'red devil'): local fishermen's tales claim that people who fell into the waters were devoured within minutes by packs of squid. Wildlife filmmaker Scott Cassell made the documentary \\"Humboldt: The Man-Eating Squid\\" for the Dangerous Waters series of the Discovery Channel. * There is some disagreement on the veracity of Humboldt squid aggression. Some scientists claim the only reports of aggression towards humans have occurred when reflective diving gear or flashing lights have been present, acting as provocation. Roger Uzun, a veteran scuba diver and amateur underwater videographer, swam with a swarm of Humboldt squid for approximately 20 minutes, later saying they seemed more curious than aggressive.Jumbo squid invade San Diego shores, spook divers , Associated Press, 16 July 2009 When not feeding or being hunted, Humboldt squid exhibit curious and intelligent behavior.Behold the Humboldt squid  Outside Online * Jeremy Wade (1956–) deals with the Humboldt squid in his documentary River Monsters. Here, a California fisherman claims to have been attacked at a fish table one night as he tried to swim from one boat to another. In the same film, a Peruvian fishermen consider this animal to be life-threatening: if one gets between them, they will be dragged down into the deep. * In another film by naturalist Steve Backshall, fishermen report, among other things, that a fisherman was caught in the abyss by a squid.

Factory, 2010 In the introduction, Lehrer describes the song as an adaptation of a routine that Danny Kaye did to honor the Russian actor Constantin Stanislavski. (The Danny Kaye routine is sung from the perspective of a famous Russian actor who learns and applies Stanislavski's secret to method acting: \\"Suffer.\\") The Stanislavski routine performed on the Danny Kaye Radio Show Lehrer sings the song from the point of view of an eminent Russian mathematician who learns from Lobachevsky that plagiarism is the secret of success in mathematics (\\"only be sure always to call it please 'research'\\"). The narrator later uses this strategy to get a paper published ahead of a rival, then to write a book and earn a fortune selling the movie rights. Lehrer wrote that he did not know Russian. In the song he quotes two \\"book reviews\\" in Russian; the first is a long sentence that he then translates succinctly as \\"It stinks\\". The second, a different but equally long sentence, is also translated as \\"It stinks.\\" The actual text of these sentences bear no relation to academics: the first phrase quotes Mussorgsky's Song of the Flea: \\"Once there was a king who had a pet flea.\\" The second references a Russian joke: \\"Now I must go where even the Tsar goes on foot\\" [the bathroom]. The song was first performed as part of The Physical Revue, a 1951–1952 musical revue by Lehrer and a few other professors. It is track 6 on Songs by Tom Lehrer, which was re-released as part of Songs & More Songs by Tom Lehrer and The Remains of Tom Lehrer. In this early version, Ingrid Bergman is named to star in the role of \\"the Hypotenuse\\" in The Eternal Triangle, a film purportedly based on the narrator's book. It was recorded again for Revisited (Tom Lehrer album), with Brigitte Bardot as the Hypotenuse. A third recording is included in Tom Lehrer Discovers Australia (And Vice Versa), a live album recorded in Australia, featuring Marilyn Monroe as the Hypotenuse.

The central-passage house, also known variously as center-hall house, hall-passage-parlor house, Williamsburg cottage, and Tidewater-type cottage, was a vernacular, or folk form, house type from the colonial period onward into the 19th century in the United States. It evolved primarily in colonial Maryland and Virginia from the hall and parlor house, beginning to appear in greater numbers by about 1700. It partially developed as greater economic security and developing social conventions transformed the reality of the American landscape, but it was also heavily influenced by its formal architectural relatives, the Palladian and Georgian styles with their emphasis on symmetry. Architectural features Locust Grove, a wood-frame example near Dillwyn, Virginia. Built prior to 1794. The central-passage house was built much like the earlier hall and parlor house, except that its hall and parlor were divided by a central passageway. In fact, in many of the earliest examples a hall-parlor arrangement had a second partition added inside the existing structure or an additional room was added to one side to form a central-passage house. In form it was one-and-a-half storied, on a raised foundation, and had gable-end chimneys. Earlier examples were always one room deep (single-pile) and had a steeply pitched roof. The single-pile eventually gave way to two-room-deep, or double-pile types and a more gentle-sloping roof with dormer windows by the end of the 18th century. Also, the earliest examples display some asymmetry, but this was quickly superseded by a strictly symmetrical facade. It usually employed the \\"double square\\" formula, that is, the house was twice as long as it was high. Timber-framed with weatherboarding and brick examples are known equally. Stylistic elements that were typical of the type were massive bookend chimneys with rectangular caps, flat or segmented arches over door and window openings, and a raised, often molded brick, water table. When built with brick masonry load-bearing walls, decorative detailing often included Flemish bond and English bond. Diapering (diagonal diamond patterns done with darker brick) was also common on gable ends.

Within two years the organisation had spread across Australia, with the Guild being established in NSW in 1946. Guild clubs were established to support war widows across Sydney and NSW. Secretaries, including Mrs Una Boyce AM OBE, who was State Secretary of the Guild from 1961 to 1989, succeeded in achieving a range of concessions and benefits for war widows.

War Widows’ Guild of Australia NSW Limited website  Motto  The Guild's Motto is an extract from King George VI’s Christmas message of 1941 and was adopted by the national Guild in 1949 at its third annual conference. The extract was considered a suitable expression of their ideals:Burge, Roslyn (2008), No Peacetime Cinderellas: a history of the War Widows’ Guild of Australia in New South Wales 1946-2006, Australia: War Widows’ Guild of Australia NSW Ltd, (hbk.) p31 \\"We all belong to each other. We all need each other. It is in serving each other and in sacrificing for our common good that we are finding our true life.\\"  War Widows' Badge and Logo  The Guild’s founder, Mrs Jessie Vasey, was the originator of the idea for the design of the Guild’s badge. It features the kookaburra, an industrious and cheerful bird who mated for life, was fearless and aggressive in the defence of its young and the area of territory it regarded as its own. The bird also had a unique call, not a song but a laugh; a chortle of rollicking mirth (to bring the widows back to laughter His Excellency Major General Michael Jeffery AC CVO MC, speech, 20 April 2007, Canberra). Also the kookaburra is a typically and completely Australian symbol, one that could be worn proudly by every widow whatever her creed or ideals. The kookaburra was also the mascot of the 7th Division , commanded by Mrs Vasey’s husband, Major-General George Alan Vasey.Clarke, Mavis Thorpe (1986), No Mean Destiny: The Story of the War Widows’ Guild of Australia 1945-85, Hyland House Publishing Pty Ltd, South Yarra, Victoria, p18, p144 Mrs Vasey asked the Hungarian sculptor, Andor Meszaros, who was living in Melbourne, to design a badge featuring this Australian bird. The badge was made of sterling silver in England, and depicted a kookaburra alighting in flight on to a branch of gum leaves. Sometime later, as membership increased, smaller badges were made out of base metal as the price of sterling silver had become prohibitive.Clarke, Mavis Thorpe (1986), No Mean Destiny: The Story of the War Widows’ Guild of Australia 1945-85, Hyland House Publishing Pty Ltd, South Yarra, Victoria, p144-145 The Guild has adopted the kookaburra badge design as its logo.

Amy depicts the journey of Amy, an autistic child with supernatural powers, and her protector Lana. In a city suffering from a zombie-type infection which Amy is immune to (and can heal Lana from), Lana must stay near her young charge, for frequent healing, while protecting her from the infected, and the Phoenix Foundation who hopes to exploit her. Amy received negative critical reviews, due to technical issues, clunky controls, voice-acting, game design, and poorly implemented gameplay and story ideas, although its story concept, gameplay ideas, music, sound design and art direction were praised, with most noting that it had unique ideas and a good atmosphere. Updates were released to address some of the complaints, primarily technical issues. Gameplay The player controls Lana, the woman escorting Amy and protecting her as the two attempt to escape their disease-ridden town. They encounter monsters and the military, among other foes, in their attempt to escape. The player is forced to protect Amy from the zombies, often making her hide, to avoid detection. However, Lana starts succumbing to the plague without medicine, and thus must remain close to Amy, to return for healing. There are syringes infrequently, which allow Lana to heal without returning to Amy. However, when Lana is somewhat infected, she can safely walk past zombies, which necessitates a balance between healing and zombification. At certain times, Lana must rely on Amy for other abilities: Amy can use shockwaves, to push enemies and objects, causing distractions, as well as a sound bubble, muffling glass either being smashed or stepped on, defending Lana. Amy also hacks computers and climbs through vents when Lana needs her to. Plot The player must escort Amy, an autistic 8-year-old as they try to get her out of a city overrun with wild creatures and enemies. Lana (Sabine Crossen) and Amy are traveling to a doctor in Silver City via train, when an explosion derails the train, and their plans. They discover that the people have been turned to monsters via a strange infection, and must escape the monsters, as they continue their journey to the city. They must also fend off the Phoenix Foundation, an organisation who intends to control Amy and exploit her strange powers. Development On 3 April 2012, VectorCell announced a patch for Amy on the game's official Facebook page. The patch was released on 6 April. Major changes include the saving of the player's progress during chapters, the addition of more checkpoints, skipping of sequences in-game and several corrections to the subtitles. Reception Amy received \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\" on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. IGN's Colin Moriarty stated at the end of his review that he \\"spent at least a dozen hours with [Amy], got as far as the end portion of the fifth chapter, and gave up out of sheer anger and frustration.\\" Game Informers Jeff Cork stated that \\"as a downloadable title, I wasn't expecting [Amy] to measure up against the triple-A juggernauts of the survival horror genre. However, I was expecting a game that was at least playable and contained some kind of entertainment. Make no mistake: Whether [Amy] is delivered to you via download, retail SKU, direct brain wave, or retinal implant, it is terrible and should be avoided.\\" Jim Sterling of Destructoid went as far in his review as to describe Amy as \\"one of the worst games ever made\\". Ben \\"Yahtzee\\" Croshaw of The Escapist criticized the game's awkward camera views, poor optimization to Xbox, and also gave up the game in frustration due to the addition of poorly implemented stealth mechanics, and later stated that it was the worst game of 2012. The most positive PlayStation 3 review was given by Thomas Pichler from GamingXP. He praised the main protagonist, but criticized the periodical lack of explanation of what to do next. Alan Bradley of GamesRadar+ said Amy was boring and no fun to play and really unpleasant for most of the time. He also criticised the combination of a bad control system and widely spaced checkpoints that meant the player would have to repeat sections numerous times. 411Mania gave the Xbox 360 version a score of 3.3 out of 10 and said that it \\"tries to offer something new. The good news is that it does introduce some new gameplay concepts that can be toyed with by developers. The bad news, the controls and gameplay are implemented in such a way the game will just leave you frustrated and angry.\\" Susan Arendt of The Escapist gave the same console version one-and-a-half stars out of five and stated, \\"Pick something to hate about videogames, and Amy has it. Graphics glitches, lousy design, repetitious gameplay, mushy controls, bad acting, horrible save system ... it's all there. The game's few good ideas simply aren't enough to suffer through the amount of crap surrounding them.\\" The A.V. Club gave the same console version a D, saying, \\"Oddly, it is tempting to look forward to a second outing, however unlikely. Because videogame disasters this gruesome are fascinating. And, to be dangerously optimistic, Amy can't get much worse.\\" Metro UK gave the same console version one out of ten, saying, \\"Awful in almost every possible aspect, this hugely disappointing download is not just a failure as a survival horror but as a video game.\\" The Digital Fix gave the PlayStation 3 version a score of one out of ten, saying, \\"If you need to satiate your survival-horror appetite go revisit the Resident Evil series, Clock Tower or Parasite Eve as you will get much more interesting and developed games despite them being released over a decade ago.\\" It was included among the worst games of all time by GamesRadar+ in 2014 and in 2017.

Girls are encouraged play with dolls. Gender polarization is a concept in sociology by American psychologist Sandra Bem which states that societies tend to define femininity and masculinity as polar opposite genders, such that male- acceptable behaviors and attitudes are not seen as appropriate for women, and vice versa.Christine Monnier, 2011, Global Sociology, Gendered Society – Basic Concepts , Retrieved Aug. 22, 2014, \\"...

When genders become polarized, according to the theory, there is no overlap, no shared behaviors or attitudes between men and women; rather, they are distinctly opposite. She argued that these distinctions become so \\"all-encompassing\\" that they \\"pervade virtually every aspect of human existence\\", not just hairstyles and clothing but how men and women express emotion and experience sexual desire.1993, Yale University, The Lenses of Gender: Transforming the Debate on Sexual Inequality, Sandra L.

The scripts can have a powerful influence on how a person develops; for example, if a person is a male, then he will likely grow to develop specific ways of looking at the world, with certain behaviors seen as 'masculine', and learn to dress, walk, talk, and even think in a socially-approved way for men. Further, any deviation from these scripts was seen as problematic, possibly defined as \\"immoral acts\\" which flout religious customs, or seen as \\"psychologically pathological\\".Bem, S. (1993).

On the same day, the Syrian government lifted its four-year ban on YouTube and Facebook. = Death of Osama bin Laden = The USAbilAraby YouTube channel posted its first content three days after Osama bin Laden was killed by US Navy SEALs in Abbottabad, Pakistan. = US State Department = USAbilAraby can be considered part of US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton's 21st Century Statecraft project. 21st century statecraft is defined as \\"complementing traditional foreign policy tools with newly innovated and adapted instruments of statecraft that fully leverage the networks, technologies, and demographics of our interconnected world.\\" In the same vein, four days after USAbilAraby began tweeting, USAdarFarsi (meaning \\"USA in Persian\\") was launched. The USAbilAraby Twitter profile describes the account as being connected to the US Department of State's Arabic Media Hub. However, the State Department's website doesn't specifically provide any information about such an organization by name. As a result, it is unclear what responsibilities it may have. Its set of responsibilities may, for example, resemble those of the US State Department's East Asia and Pacific Media Hub, the mission of which \\"is to help media organizations in the East Asia and Pacific region find U.S. Government officials to interview, on whatever topic or issue is of interest.\\" The East Asia and Pacific Media Hub offers to arrange film, radio, and telephone interviews with US officials for the media, and currently has presences on both Twitter and Facebook and can be reached by email. The use of the word \\"hub\\" in \\"US Department of State Arabic Media Hub\\" suggests that the USAbilAraby Twitter account and YouTube channel may be joined by additional Arabic-language presences in social media in the future.  Reactions  The launch of the USAbilAraby Twitter account received more attention in US media than in Arab media. However, an article on AlBaghdadiya.com attributes the appearance of the USAbilAraby Twitter account to the events in Tunisia and Egypt and the value of channels like Twitter and Facebook for publishing news quickly and widely within this context. Similarly, an article on Raya.fm locates USAbilAraby within a larger phenomenon of new Arabic-language offerings from Western news outlets and bloggers, inspired by these events.  Language  It has been noted that USAbilAraby's tweets employ Modern Standard Arabic, a formal register commonly used in media and official discourse. This contrasts with other forms of Arabic used in social media contexts, particularly by non-institutional actors; these forms often employ dialect and may be typed in the Roman alphabet (see, for example, Arabizi).

These high moisture levels create lawns that attract a large amount of grazing by marsupials. Commonly found in Tasmania, the lawns function as habitats for local animals. Background/History Similar turfs have been discovered in New Zealand that are maintained by small mammals such as rabbits or sheep. Similar patterns of feeding and use have been recorded in both New Zealand and Tasmania. These lawns are also similar to the famous mammalian lawns of Serengeti. In Tasmania, the lawns form sporadically within woody landscapes as well as sheltered areas along the coast. They are found at altitudes ranging from alpine to coastal, and are often associated with wetlands. Marsupial lawns are also frequently found behind dunes along the eastern coast. Coastal shores are often lined with tea-tree, banksias, and eucalypts, marshes and marsupial lawns in sheltered areas where mud can slowly accumulate. The lawns can only evolve from constant grazing. The Bay of Fires is a common tourist area for visitors to view the various land structures and forms, including marsupial lawns. Along with their habitats in woody forests and behind sand dunes, indigenous marsupials patrol domestic lawns nightly. The animals chew off any growth in the grass from the previous night. Fire risk is reduced by this frequent trimming, and the soil remains fertilized and conditioned by fecal matter the marsupials leave behind. Many farmers have found that using the marsupials to aid their plants works great. They allow the marsupials to come in at night and trim grasses in their gardens. This also reveals weeds or other shrubs, making extraction of unwanted plants easier. The marsupials leave vegetables and fruits alone while focusing only on eating grass. While this may be beneficial to crop farmers, others are frustrated with constant efforts to keep marsupials out of their grass cattle pastures. Expensive fencing and repair to keep marsupials out of pastures has caused much controversy. Marsupial lawns have become home for many of Tasmania's animals, marsupials in particular. The most prevalent of these animals in the lawns are known as the Big Five. They are the forester kangaroo, the Bennett's wallaby, the Tasmanian pademelon, the common wombat, and the Tasmanian devil. Role of grazing Environmental observations and enclosure experiments have been used to test whether vertebrate grazers are a critical element in maintaining marsupial lawns, or if water inundation played a larger role in formation. Results have shown that both woody and non-woody plants became much taller in the lawns when marsupial grazers were excluded, while the inundation had no effect on woody growth. This shows that marsupials are essential to maintaining lawns, and without them the structure of the lawns would deteriorate. Human impacts Local human activity has the potential to have a profound influence on the factors that affect marsupial lawn creation and sustainment. In addition to altering these variables, humans also destroy lawn habitat through farming and grazing. In order for these lawns to flourish, natural grazing patterns and fire cycles must be maintained. Humans are encroaching on marsupials’ habitat and altering fire patterns, meaning that Australia's marsupial lawns are under threat. As one might expect, land use changes, such as farming and grazing, are one of the biggest threats for marsupial lawns. These lawns are prime areas for agricultural use because they are naturally located in areas of high soil moisture and nutrient content. This high moisture content and soil richness can be attributed to natural topography and rainfall patterns. In contrast, much of the rest of Australia's tropical savannas experience sporadic rainfall, meaning they can support very little vegetation growth. As a result, while marsupial lawns are able to cope with small scale disturbances, such as roads or power lines, when large tracts of lawn are destroyed, there is nowhere for the animals or plants to migrate to. Furthermore, herbivore grazing is essential to prevent the invasion of woody species into the lawns. Therefore, destruction of large herbivorous marsupial habitat will also negatively affect lawn growth. Unfortunately, decreased agricultural production has resulted in pressure to develop these economically valuable areas, and it is important that such development is undertaken in a way that acknowledges the value of this unique ecosystem. =Impact of the cattle industry= With the acceleration of the Australian cattle industry over the past decade, Australian geography has undergone serious environmental changes which have affected marsupial lawns.Newsome, A.E. 1975. An ecological comparison of the two arid-zone kangaroos of Australia, and their anomalous prosperity since the introduction of ruminant stock to their environment. The Quarterly Review of Biology 50: 389-424 Australia is the second largest beef exporter in the world and the cattle industry its largest agricultural sector. Increasing beef demand expanded the size of farms and numbers of livestock into areas previously unsuitable for sustained pasture farming. Since Australian farmers use irrigation to water crops and nourish animals, dry landscape can be converted into fertile soil. Changing the environment from desert to grassland extends fertile land into herbivore habitat. Marsupials that once scavenged the dry deserts for scarce grasses and sparse leafy shrubs now find an abundance of vegetation, particularly in areas being farmed. With this large amount of resources now available, marsupials, have been able to reproduce more than ever before. Most cattle are free range, yet a few are fenced in by a three line barbed wire fence that red kangaroos have no problem jumping over to feed on irrigated grasses. Farmers also erect agricultural settlements near rivers or flood-outs. Although farms may be in the desert, these oases can provide the water for an entire crop or herd if managed correctly. Marsupials use these creeks and flood-outs as natural habitats; however, once farmers irrigate these bodies of water, their habitats are extended. Instead of feeding on dry grass with low nourishment, kangaroos and other marsupials seek the plush grasses growing off irrigated moist soil. As farmers continue to use these methods, the marsupial population will continue to increase. However, while some agricultural development has enabled kangaroos to expand their population in the harsh conditions of arid Australia, other human developments pose problems to these marsupials. For example, many farmers have reported seeing kangaroos drowning in the watering holes of free-range cattle. As the cows drink and wallow in the ponds, the desert clay becomes an adhesive substance. When kangaroos come to replenish themselves in the ponds they sink into the inescapable goo and die from starvation or heat stroke. Role of fire on lawns In addition to grazing, fires have a significant effect on the health of marsupial lawns. One of the defining characteristics of lawns is a lack of woody plants. As a result, fires play an important role in the creation and maintenance of these habitats because fires curtail woody plants, and return nutrients to the soil to allow for future growth. Human caused fires have contrasting effects on marsupial lawns. On one hand, they are often set by indigenous people who use the fires to concentrate marsupials for hunting, which in turn results in lower lawn grazing and more woody plant growth. On the other hand, these fires destroy woody plants and allow grass to grow in its place, which increases potential marsupial lawn area. Consequently, fire suppression efforts may prevent some lawns from getting the woody growth pruning they need. In addition, fire suppression causes unnatural brush buildup, so when an area finally burns it can become hot enough to reduce the viability of the soil for years. Potential effects of climate change In addition to local impacts such as land use and fire management, global issues such as climate change also have the potential to impact marsupial lawn ecosystems. Because of the scope of the predicted changes, global warming has the ability to affect precipitation levels, temperature, and fire cycles in Australia. This in turn will alter where and to what extent marsupial lawns can exist. However, currently it is not possible to predict whether or not climate change will increase or decrease the total acreage of marsupial lawns. Climate models predict that northern Australia may see slightly increased rainfall in the coming decades.However, the precipitation may be less reliable, and as a result there may be long periods of drought or at the very least a longer dry season each year. In addition, climate change will bring with it higher overall temperatures, as well as continually elevating levels of carbon dioxide (CO2). Preliminary research shows that higher temperatures, higher rainfall, and elevated CO2 levels may lead to increased woody plant growth. This in turn would decrease marsupial lawn habitat. However, higher temperatures and a long dry season mean increased fire frequency, which could serve to offset the new woody growth. To further complicate matters, it is possible that the higher levels of evaporation brought on by increased temperatures could compensate for the increased rainfall. However, research has not been done to determine whether higher precipitation or higher temperatures will have a greater effect on water availability in the region. The overall effect of climate change on marsupial lawns, and the greater northern Australia area, is needed to be studied in greater detail. Currently the counteracting and overlapping effects make it difficult to discern the overall impact human induced climate change will have on marsupial lawns.

Unbeknownst to Sawyers, just a few miles from the ford, Connor had attacked the Arapaho of Chief Black Bear just 4 days prior. As the wagons crossed the river, Arapaho warriors attacked and scattered the expedition's cattle herd. The cavalry unlimbered a howitzer while Sawyers corralled the wagons. The Arapaho appeared to have left and Sawyers continued along the trail but was attacked a second time. Retreating to the river they were attacked trying to find an alternate route downstream. Heading back upstream Sawyers corralled the wagons, but two members of his team were killed and he decided to move and corral his wagons for a third time.Doyle p.350 Sawyers was in desperate measures by nightfall. The next morning the Arapaho leaders met with Sawyers. The Arapaho had been part of the group recently attacked by General Connor and believed Sawyers’ expedition was military reinforcements. The Arapaho chiefs stated Connor's troops had captured their ponies and they wanted them back.Johnson p.167 The Arapaho and Sawyers agreed to send 3 men each to find Connor. While the Arapaho were hoping to have their animals back, Sawyers was looking for military reinforcements to continue his expedition. For several days Sawyers’ men and the Arapaho faced off at each other through bad weather. On September 12 with no word from Connor the men of Sawyer’ expedition mutinied and replaced Sawyers in command. Under new command the expedition broke away from the Arapaho and began its return to Fort Connor on September 13. Aftermath The withdrawal did not last long as reinforcements sent from Connor arrived along the road back to Fort Connor under the command of Captain Albert E. Brown. With Brown's help Sawyers reasserted his authority over the expedition and turned back toward Virginia City.Johnson p.168 This third attempt to reach Virginia City encountered almost no hostile Natives.

CQ measures the ability of people to communicate effectively with one another. The first scholarly article referring to CQ was by Robert Service in CQ: the Communication Quotient for IS professionals. The article was published in 2005 in the Journal of Information Science. In 2010 at TED Women, Clare Munn spoke about the importance of our Communication Quotient in an increasingly digital world. History The development of CQ as a theory and a concept can be traced back to the challenging of IQ as fully explaining cognitive ability in 1983, by Howard Gardner with his Theory of multiple intelligences. In Gardner's view, traditional types of intelligence, such as IQ, fail to fully explain cognitive ability. The development of CQ is part of the trend to analyse and fully understand human intelligence, a trend led by Daniel Goleman's emotional intelligence and social intelligence. Definition The Times of India in 2005 , in an article entitled A Shift from IQ, referred to CQ as an ability multi-national corporations were testing for amongst Indian graduates. In 2005 Craig Harrison in Improving Your Communication Quotient described CQ skills specifically in terms of workplace communication. In 2007 Clare Munn defined CQ as \\"Expressive & Receptive Intelligence\\" the communication bridge between IQ and EQ. In 2011 Alistair Gordon and Steve Kimmens in The CQ Manifesto defined CQ as \\"saying the right thing in the right way to the right people at the right time in a such a way that the message is received and understood as it was intended\\". In Robert Service’s 2005 article he presented the communication quotient as a measurable and improvable type of intelligence, specifically for IT and IS professionals. Service argues that the improvement of communication ability will allow individuals the opportunity to move up in the organisational ranks. The article presents two models to explain communication, the first is the model of two-way communications and the second is the CQ measurement and improvement matrix.

It is paired with the Cello Concerto on Vol. I of Glass' Concerto Project, a set of eight concerti by the composer. A typical performance of the work lasts 25–28 minutes.http://www.chesternovello.com/Concerto_Fantasy It was written for Jonathan Haas and later recorded by Evelyn Glennie, and was premiered by Haas and Svet Stoyanov with the American Symphony Orchestra in Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, conducted by Leon Botstein. The work was commissioned jointly by the American Symphony Orchestra, the Peabody Symphony, the Milwaukee Symphony, the St. Louis Symphony and the Phoenix Symphony.http://www.chesternovello.com/commission In 2004, a transcription for wind ensemble was written by Mark Lortz,GLASS, P.: Concerto Fantasy for 2 Timpanists and Orchestra (arr. M. Lortz) which debuted at Peabody Institute in 2005.Local teacher's version of Glass' work to be played; Art Notes - Baltimore Sun, February 04, 2005 Orchestration The concerto is scored for a large orchestra with particular emphasis on percussion:reference page at publisher (Chester Novello) *Woodwinds: piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, E clarinet, 2 B clarinets, bass clarinet in B, 2 bassoons *Brass: 4 horns in F, 3 trumpets in B, 2 trombones, bass trombone, tuba *Percussion (4 players): snare drum, glockenspiel, xylophone, tenor drum, bass drum, piano, triangle, tambourine, tom-tom, tam-tam, chime, wood block, cymbals, suspended cymbals, vibes, marimba *Strings: harp, piano, violins I, violins II, violas, cellos, double basses *Two solo timpanists Structure Glass wrote this work in standard three-movement concerto format. =Movement I= The first movement begins with an immediate presentation of the opening thematic material, a ten- note statement of the strings in conjunction with powerful timpani strikes. The strings and brass proceed to develop this statement while the soloists provide relatively constant rhythmic undertone. After perhaps two minutes, woodwinds introduce a new, less fierce theme which leads into a slightly varied recapitulation of the first statement. Glass then inserts a characteristic series of chord progressions often present in his mature style. These rise in intensity, flying into a complex, ecstatic tutti. Playing throughout the majority of the movement, the timpani guide the orchestra into a quick descent, and, having quieted the ensemble, provide gentle pulse. Brass play some short chords, and then settle onto a lingering resolution. The movement, approximately six minutes in length, draws to a tranquil close. =Movement II= The slow movement opens with a distant trumpet call, with both timpani playing quietly. This presents an ominous feel; the introduction closely resembles an approaching, marching army. Soon the strings play an eerie, shimmering accompaniment to this scene. A quiet woodwind section gives a low pulse typical of Glass, in accordance with a similar throb of the tambourines. Although there are periodic rises, there is no apparent climax and the movement concludes quietly. Its duration is nine minutes. =Movement III= A cadenza, for both timpani, opens the final movement. Occasionally it is set aside as a separate section of the concerto, but on most recordings, it is featured as part of the third movement. During the cadenza, both timpani engage in exchanges, whose character range from almost inaudible to deafeningly loud. At one point Glass instructs the timpanists to abandon their mallets and play with their bare hands, creating higher pitch. The orchestra reenters with a sudden burst of cymbals, after which the cadenza segues directly into the third movement proper, with a rapid rhythm set by wood block and other auxiliary percussion. The orchestra gradually builds up intensity; the movement grows into a passionate, major-key high-point consisting of quick triplets from a number of instruments, with the timpani providing unceasing, driving pulse. Suddenly the excitement dies; nevertheless, the woodblocks continue the rhythm set earlier. As if the first period of animation was a mere precursor, the movement rebuilds itself into an even louder and more enthusiastic climax, the timpani performing complex maneuvers in coordination with one another. Set into full-force vigor, the movement concludes triumphantly on a version of Glass' signature four-note concerto motif, which is also used to conclude the Cello Concerto No. 1, the Harpsichord Concerto (Glass), and the Tirol Piano Concerto. This motif is probably inspired by Rachmaninoff's signature concerto ending, which is a similar burst of four notes. Throughout the entirety of the last movement (and for much of the concerto), the timpani have intense, constant involvement, which is taxing for the performers. Therefore, this piece has developed a reputation of requiring energetic soloists. Premiere The concerto was premiered on November 19, 2000, in New York's Lincoln Center. The two soloists were Jonathan Haas and Svetoslav Stoyanov, playing with the American Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Leon Botstein.http://www.philipglass.com/music/compositions/concerto_fantasy_for_2_timpanists_orchestra.php The work has become popular and was later performed by Haas and John Chimes with the BBC Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Marin Alsop. In addition, the work has been conducted under Gerard Schwarz, performed by Evelyn Glennie, Haas and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra.

The small leaves are semi-succulent, and have a distinctive arrowhead shape. They grow along long, vine-like branches spreading out form the centre of the plant. Both the leaves and the branches are of a light green colour. Flowers are inconspicuous green balls, which form on top of terminal spikes during summer. These transform into very conspicuous, tiny, bright-red berries during early autumn. Human uses The plant was boiled along with other species of saltbush for use as a greens substitute by early European settlers in the Adelaide region. The plant is easily propagated, making it a particularly attractive and useful plant for revegetation projects. It has recently been enjoying increasing popularity as a garden plant, for its low maintenance, low water usage properties.

The consequence is poor regeneration of such plants without intensive greenhouse acclimation for outdoor growth.Kei-ichiro U, Susan C and Kalidas S (1998). Reduced hyperhydricity and enhanced growth of tissue culture-generated raspberry (Rubus sp.) clonal lines by Pseudomonas sp. isolated from oregano. Process Biochemistry 33(4): 441-445. Additionally, it may also lead to leaf- tip and bud necrosis in some cases, which often leads to loss of apical dominance in the shoots.Cassells A and Curry R (2001). Oxidative stress and physiological, epigenetic and genetic variability in plant tissue culture: implications for micropropagators and genetic engineers. Plant Cell, Tissue and Organ Culture. 64(2-3):145-157 In general, the main symptom of hyperhydricity is translucent characteristics signified by a shortage of chlorophyll and high water content. Specifically, the presence of a thin or absent cuticular layer, reduced number of palisade cells, irregular stomata, less developed cell wall and large intracellular spaces in the mesophyll cell layer have been described as some of the anatomic changes associated with hyperhydricity.Franck T, Kevers C, Gaspar T, Dommes J, Deby C, Greimers R, Serteyn D and Deby-Dupont G (2004). Hyperhydricity of Prunus avium shoots cultured on gelrite: a controlled stress response. Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, 42: 519-527 Causes The main causes of hyperhydricity in plant tissue culture are those factors triggering oxidative stresses such as high salt concentration, high relative humidity, low light intensity, gas accumulation in the atmosphere of the jar, length of time intervals between subcultures; number of subcultures, concentration and type of gelling agent, the type of explants used, the concentrations of microelement and hormonal imbalances.2 Hyperhydricity is commonly apparent in liquid culture-grown plants or when there is low concentration of gelling agent. High ammonium concentration also contributes to hyperhydricity.Franck T, Kevers C, Gaspar T, Dommes J, Deby C, Greimers R, Serteyn D and Deby-Dupont G (2004). Hyperhydricity of Prunus avium shoots cultured on gelrite: a controlled stress response. Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, 42: 519-527 Control Hyperhydricity can be monitored by modifying the atmosphere of the culture vessels. Adjusting the relative humidity in the vessel is one of the most important parameters to be controlled. Use of gas-permeable membranes may help in this regard as this allows increased exchange of water vapor and other gases such as ethylene with the surrounding environment. Using higher concentration of a gelling agent, on top of the use of a higher-strength gelling agent may reduce the risk from hyperhydricity. Hyperhydricity can also be controlled by bottom cooling, which allows water to condense on the medium,Pérez-Tornero O, Egea J, Olmos E and Burgos L (2001). Control of Hyperhydricity in Micropropagated Apricot Cultivars. In Vitro Cellular & Developmental Biology.

In the 2011 census, there were 71,284 Protestants in Serbia (excluding the territory of Kosovo) and they comprised 1% of the population of the country. Ethnic Slovaks constitute majority of Serbia's Protestant community. Some members of other ethnic groups (especially Serbs in absolute terms and Hungarians and Germans in proportional terms) are also adherents of various forms of Protestant Christianity. Most of the Protestants (64,029) are located in the province of Vojvodina. The largest percentage on municipal level is in the municipalities of Bački Petrovac and Kovačica, where the absolute or relative majority of the population are ethnic Slovaks (most of whom are adherents of Protestant Christianity). Other relatively large Protestant community is found in the second largest Serbian city Novi Sad with 8,499 Protestants. Outside Vojvodina, sizable concentration of Protestants in the rest of the country are recorded in Leskovac (2,493) and Belgrade (1,606).http://pod2.stat.gov.rs/ObjavljenePublikacije/Popis2011/Knjiga4_Veroispovest.pdf There are various Protestant groups in the country, including Methodists, Seventh-day Adventists and Evangelical Baptists (Nazarene). Many of these groups are situated in the culturally diverse province of Vojvodina. Prior to the end of World War II, the number of Protestants in the region was larger. Protestantism (mostly in its Nazarene form) started to spread among Serbs in Vojvodina in the last decades of the 19th century. Although the percentage of Protestants among Serbs is not large, it is the only religious form besides Orthodoxy which is currently widespread among Serbs. Denominations =Christian Nazarene Community= Prayer House of Nazarene Christian Community in Novi Sad. Services are performed in Serbian language. The Nazarene form of Protestant Christianity, known as Apostolic Christian Church (Nazarene) in North America, appeared among Serbs during the 1860s in the region of Vojvodina, which in that time was administered by the Austrian Empire (renamed to Austria-Hungary in 1867). The religious group also spread to what was then the Principality of Serbia as early as in 1872. Due to their commitment to non-violence and refusal to carry weapons and serve in the army, the Nazarenes were persecuted and imprisoned by all three state authorities under which they lived: the pre-World War I Austro-Hungarian and Serbian and post-World War I Serb-Croat-Slovene (i.e. Yugoslav). In 1892, most of 210 prisoners in Pest who were imprisoned because they refused to carry weapons were Serbs from Bačka.Bojan Aleksov, Nazareni među Srbima, Beograd, 2010, page 120. During the last two decades of the 19th century, a sizable Nazarene communities were formed in several (mostly ethnic Serb) settlements in Vojvodina: Melenci, Dolovo, Mokrin, Lokve, Mramorak, Padina, Debeljača, Bavanište, Banatski Karlovac, Perlez, and Banatsko Novo Selo. Larger Nazarene communities were also present in some sizable cities of the region, such are Sombor, Novi Sad, Pančevo, and Veliki Bečkerek. The settlement with largest percentage of Nazarenes among population was the Serb village of Nadalj (in the end of the 19th century, 250 of total number of 2,000 villagers were Nazarenes).Bojan Aleksov, Nazareni među Srbima, Beograd, 2010, pages 122–124. According to 1891 census, there was 6,829 Nazarenes in the Kingdom of Hungary (one of two parts of Austria-Hungary), of which 4,400 were Serbs (the presented numbers did not included territory of autonomous Kingdom of Croatia- Slavonia).Bojan Aleksov, Nazareni među Srbima, Beograd, 2010, page 126.

Although the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century were periods in which Nazarene religious group was widely spread among Serbs, later parts of the 20th century recorded certain decline of the Nazarene community. The decline of the community had various reason: many members of the community emigrated across the ocean and settled in the United States and Canada, some of the Nazarenes who originally were of Eastern Orthodox background converted back to Eastern Orthodox Christianity, while others converted to other Protestant denominations. Since World War I, the largest Protestant community among Serbs became the Adventists.Bojan Aleksov, Nazareni među Srbima, Beograd, 2010, page 295.

It was carrying a mixed cargo of general mechanical equipment owned by a major multinational company.Colin Freeman, Abandoned at sea - the forgotten hostages of the Somali pirates, The Daily Telegraph, 29 August 2012 The ship was heavily insured and was bound for Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates. The vessel was originally carrying 25 crew members consisting of nationals from Yemen, India, Ghana, Sudan, Pakistan and the Philippines. One of the crew members, Wagdi Akram, committed suicide on 27 October 2010 by jumping overboard. The Azal Shipping company have told Wagdi Akram's family that reports of him being beaten and starved to death could have contributed to his death.

On December 22, the Police Force was able to board the ship and rescue the 22 surviving crew members after almost three years in captivity. They were taken to a hospital in Puntland for basic health checks, then flown home. Five Indian survivors were invited to a two-day recovery workshop in Mumbai, directed by the Maritime Piracy Humanitarian Response Programme. It was reported that many of them were suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome. The Indian government guaranteed survivors better-paying jobs in Indian waters.

He was the president of the Teamsters union Local 282 between 1976 and 1984, during which time he utilized strikes, extortion and mafia intimidation to bend developers to his will and gained a fearsome reputation within the New York construction industry. Biography Cody was born in the Hells Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan. Cody got his start in the Teamster's union as a $1-a-day trucker's helper in his teens. He was imprisoned for armed robbery in his early 20s shortly after serving as a U.S. marine towards the end of World War II. At the height of his power Cody was considered the \\"construction industry's most powerful union leader.\\" In 1982, federal prosecutors convicted him of extortion, at a time when Cody was so feared by construction workers that they built his beach house for him in South Hampton and provided him with chauffeurs free of charge. Cody used the mafia in New York to further intimidate developers, first working with the Gambino crime family and then Paul Castellano. Cody would kickback at least $200,000 a year to the mafia and was also convicted of providing a $2 million loan to Chicago mobsters. Cody was responsible for delivering cement and building materials for virtually every major building site in Manhattan from the mid-1970s to the mid-'80s. Tom Galvin, who was chief operating officer of the Battery Park City Authority, the agency that oversaw the construction Gateway Plaza, said, \\"LeFrak didn't get around John Cody. Nobody did.\\" (Sam LeFrak was the developer of the Gateway Plaza). It was reported that John Cody added millions of dollars to the Gateway Plaza's costs. At the work site of the AT&T; Building, Cody blamed black workers for creating dangerous work conditions in order to ensure additional union members would receive jobs. He told contractors that extra union workers equipped with walkie-talkies would be required at the job site to ensure safe working conditions. Cody threatened strikes if developers did not comply with his demands, and considering the huge costs a strike would incur, developers often capitulated. Cody was known for his cautious behavior, including installing anti-bugging devices in his phones and patting guests at his home for bugs. As a result, federal prosecutors described him as a tough case to crack. However, Cody eventually went to jail for racketeering and Robert Sasso, the Treasurer of 282, took power. In what federal prosecutors described as a \\"desperate attempt\\" to regain power, Cody hired a former jailhouse inmate to assassinate Sasso. The inmate was an informant for the FBI, and recorded conversations about the plot, including Cody discussing \\"relative merits of using explosives or a gun with a silencer,\\" to kill Sasso. Cody went to prison for attempted murder as a result. Cody died of Alzheimer's disease in 2001, at the age of 79.

The Academy is focused in the research of the ruining processes of Taipei that keep the city alive.Ruin Academy – Greek Architects 2011 The element of Ruin is viewed as something man-made having become part of nature.Chen House by C-Laboratory – Dezeen 2009 Third Generation City follows the first generation where humans' peacefully coexisted with nature and the second generation built walls and stone structures everywhere in an attempt to shut out nature. In the third generation however, nature, which can never be truly shut out, grows back through the ruins, through the cracks in the wall, sucking human nature back into the wider nature. Third Generation City concentrates on local knowledge and urban acupuncture.Returning Humans to Nature and Reality – Nick Couson, eRenlai 2011 Third Generation cities are those that have grown from the ruin of industrial society but lie beyond its fordist structure of social and economic organization. Principally, Third Generation cities can be conceived of as rhizomatic in nature and ultimately, bound up with pre-existing and future conditions of human construction.Ruin Academy - Lee-Michael J. Pronko, Art & Science Journal, 2012 The Third Generation City is the industrial city ruined by the people – human nature as part of nature.Cross-Over Architecture and the Third Generation City – Epifanio 2009 The elements of the Third Generation Taipei are: * Anarchist Gardener  Spontaneous community gardens and urban farms operating outside the official urban development. * Urban Nomad / Instant Taipei  Light weigh and movable citizen architectural actions attached on top of the static city. * Urban Acupuncture  Architecture that is in the position of producing needles for the urban Qi. * Compost  Independent, self organized and often illegal communities that are organically editing the official city. * River Urbanism  A form of landscape urbanism – city developed from the viewpoint of river nature. Ruin Academy – Epifanio 14, 2011 Ruin Academy’s workshops bring an ecological approach to a mapping of the city’s informal activities. In this sense, lodging a constructed nature within an architecture of decay dramatizes the incursion of the organic in the city.

Jaff tribe, the biggest tribe in Kurdistan, native to the Zagros area, which is divided between Iran and Iraq. Adela Khanem was of the famous aristocratic Sahibqeran family, who intermarried with the tribal chiefs of Jaff.Adela Jaff Lady Adela exerted great influence in the affairs of Jaff tribe in the Sharazor plain. She was born in 1847 the ruling family in Sanandaj, second largest city of Iranian Kurdistan. She married Kurdish King Osman Pasha Jaff, whose headquarters was in Halabja. Her husband Osman Pasha Jaff, was a Pasha and she ruled in his place at her husband’s absence. Her father was the grand visir of Persia and her uncles were grand visirs of the Ottoman Empire and Saudi Arabia. Adela Jaff was one of the few rulers that were women in the region. The British invaded German Ottoman Iraq during World War I and conquered it with the treaty of Mudros in 1917. They wished to give the Kurds Autonomy by setting up the Mosul commission in 1918. They gave Mahmud Barzanji power, but he revolted and launched a campaign to murder all British political officers assigned to each tribe in 1919. She was even revered by the British because of her acts of mercy towards British captives, who were a part of the Mesopotamian invasion during World War I. Adela Khanum Jaff gave all British political officers refugee within her houses. This is when Adela Khanum defended, supported, fed, and gave the British refugee.Then they would ultimately give her the title Khan-Bahadur by Major Fraser, called her Princess of the Brave, and she would reign with the British far beyond the death of Osman Pasha Jaff in 1909. The Jaff dialect (called Jaffi) is part of Sorani, a south-southeastern branch of Kurdish language family. The region inhabited by this tribe is southwest of Sanandaj all the way to Javanroud, and also areas around the city of Sulaimaniyah in Southern Kurdistan. Once nomadic, the Jaffs have more recently settled into a predominantly agricultural way of life and are often known as the most educated and intellectual tribe of the Kurds. Lady Adela (center), ruler of Halabja, meeting with Major Soane in 1919. Gertrude Bell, British politician and writer, describes Adela Khanem in a letter in 1921 as follow: \\" The feature of Halabja is 'Adlah Khanum the great Jaff Beg Zadah lady, mother of Ahmad Beg. She is the widow of Kurdish King Osman Pasha Jaff, sometime dead, and continues to rule the Jaff as much as she can and intrigue more than you would think anyone could, and generally behave as great Kurdish ladies do behave. She has often written to me, feeling, I've no doubt, that we must be birds of a feather, and I hastened to call on her after lunch. She is a striking figure in her gorgeous Kurdish clothes with jet black curls (dyed, I take it) falling down her painted cheeks from under her huge headdress. We carried on in Persian, a very complimentary talk in the course of which I managed to tell them how well 'Iraq was doing under Faisal and to assure them that all we wished was that our two children, 'Iraq and Kurdistan, should live in peace and friendship with one another\\". Vladimir Minorsky has reported his meeting with Lady Adela in the region of Halabja in 1913. Major Soane wrote about her in his book To Mesopotamia and Kurdistan in Disguise: \\"a woman unique in Islam, in the power she possesses, and the efficacy with which she uses the weapons in her hands.... In a remote corner of the Turkish Empire, which decays and retrogrades, is one little spot, which, under the rule of a Kurdish woman has risen from a village to be a town, and one hill-side, once barren, now sprinkled with gardens; and these are in a measure renovations of the ancient state of these parts.\\"  See also  * Kurdistan * Kurdish women * Jaff tribe  References  * Cecil J.

Undomesticated and very rare in cultivation, it is known as fuzzyfruit nightshade, naranjilla silvestre or chichilegua. The fruit somewhat resembles the related cocona (Solanum sessiliflorum), and Solanum candidum will apparently hybridize with a number of close relatives, including cocona, naranjilla, and pseudolulo. One notable difference is the extremely hirsute fruits, which – unlike most of its relatives – do not detach easily upon full ripening, which is a hindrance to eating the ripe fruit. Nonetheless, S. candidum is a close relative of other nightshades cultivated for their edible fruit, including the tomato (S. lycopersicum), the naranjilla (S. quitoense) and the eggplant (S. melongena). Its relatively strong resistance to pests and disease (in comparison with its more appetizing relatives) has drawn some agricultural interest. Scientifically, S. candidum is of additional interest, as it appears to be the closest relative and a possible ancestor to Asian members of the same botanical clade, notably Solanum lasiocarpum, which is native to India, but is cultivated for its naranjilla-like fruits, and will likewise readily hybridize with S. candidum. Distribution and habitat Solanum candidum is presumed to be native to the temperate Andean regions of Colombia, Peru and Chile. Like the cocona, naranjilla, and Indian nightshade, S. candidium can bear fruit within 1 or 2 years from seed. A short-lived perennial, fruit production requires a rather long growing season, which limits its agricultural potential in more temperate climates. Like the naranjilla and cocona, S. candidum is best adapted to subtropical cloud forest climates, where frost is unknown, but extreme heat is likewise very rare or unknown. The fruits are round berries, covered in a persistent fur even when ripe, to 2 cm in size, which ripen to yellow or red. Ripe fruits are less juicy than more commonly cultivated relatives, though the flavor is reportedly appealing. Like most edible nightshades, the S. candidum is attractive to pests such as aphids, white flies, beetles, and spider mites, all of which can destroy naranjillas and coconas quickly. S. candidum reportedly has a slightly higher resistance to those pests.

In other words, it was intended to demonstrate that it is possible to significantly reduce the amount of bio-waste at a local level. The project was co-funded by the LIFE+ programme of the European Commission. The project emphasized the efficiency and sustainability of bio- waste reduction actions at source, in particular by organising demonstration actions and trainings for the population, and by offering a better way of evaluating and controlling waste prevention. Main goals The project endeavors to demonstrate, in accordance with the recent Waste Framework Directive, that it is possible to significantly reduce the amount of organic waste (also called \\"bio-waste\\", covering both food and green waste) at the source in a sustainable way, and to monitor actions for waste reduction in an efficient manner. The Miniwaste project has four main objectives: * to gather and share good practices and case studies, which allow to reduce bio-waste and are implemented by European local and regional authorities (for instance, composting); * to reduce bio-waste in the partner countries (namely France, Portugal and the Czech Republic), by implementing demonstration actions at different scales; * to develop and implement monitoring procedures, such as a computerised tool, allowing to assess the quality and the quantity of the compost; * to disseminate the deliverables and results obtained by the partners, in order to provide guidance for European authorities in terms of bio-waste reduction. Partners The Miniwaste partners are the local authorities of Rennes Métropole (project leader, France), Brno (Czech Republic) and Lipor (urban area of Porto, Portugal), together with ACR+ (Association of Cities and Regions for Recycling and Sustainable Resource Management) and Cemagref (a French composting research centre). Within the project, the three local authorities will seek, test and disseminate appropriate tools that will allow implementation and monitoring of actions for organic waste reduction on their territories. The project thus presents a way of integrating demonstrative actions at different scales (from pilot actions to large-scale actions) with different European partners. Events Apart from setting up a set of communication tools (project website, leaflet, newsletter, final report), two key events will take place in the course of the project: * A technical workshop, which was held on 12–13 September in Brno (Czech Republic); * Miniwaste final conference, which will take place on 20–21 November 2012 in Rennes (France). Reduction of bio-waste Bio-waste is kitchen waste (raw or cooked food waste) and green waste (garden and park waste). Reducing bio-waste can mainly be obtained by limiting food waste and by practicing collective or individual composting of food and green waste. According to studies, an average European produces between 100 kg and 250 kg of organic waste per year. 10% of this waste can be avoided by limiting food waste and almost 30 to 70% can be composted, including at source.

He was fast- tracked into the club's under-18 side when he was still aged 16 after having scored 52 goals for the under-16s during the 2008–09 season, and was included in a first team matchday squad for the first time on 1 May 2010, when he was an unused substitute in a 3–0 home defeat at the hands of Norwich City. He signed his first professional contract two months after his seventeenth birthday, when he put his name to a two-year deal on 19 November 2010. He was an unused substitute five times during the 2010–11 season before making his senior debut on 16 April 2011 when he came on as an 86th-minute replacement for player-manager Stuart Campbell. He was released by Rovers at the end of the 2012–13 season, before eventually signing for Bath City on a short-term deal in September 2012. He was included in the Romans' squad to face Bromley on 8 September, and was brought on as a half-time substitute, but after suffering an asthma attack less than half an hour after coming on he had to be substituted himself.

He had a career as a fashionable portrait painter in London for more than forty years, working in a style similar to that of John Vanderbank. In 1732, he was commissioned by Lord Barington to paint a portrait of Frederick, Prince of Wales on horseback. In 1733, he moved to 55, Great Queen Street, which had formed part of the house of Sir Godfrey Kneller until his death two years before. He played a part in the development of the conversation piece, making groups of model figures to judge effects of light and shade. His portraits of the historian Nathaniel Hooke and of Frederick, Prince of Wales are in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery, as is another painting by Dandridge, believed to be of William Kent.

Route description Spur 729 has an eastern terminus at an at-grade intersection with US 83 near the buildings of the Guthrie Common School District. The short route travels to the west along 6th Street, ending at a barricaded dead end. History Spur 729 was designated on July 26, 2007 after TxDOT rerouted US 82 / SH 114 around Guthrie. Originally, US 82 entered Guthrie from the west and was duplexed with US 83 southbound for approximately one mile before the two routes separated past the South Wichita River bridge. The concurrency was eliminated with the construction of the US 82 bypass to the west of Guthrie and the upgrading of the southern intersection of the two highways to an interchange. Spur 729 is a section of the former US 82 into Guthrie, while the remaining portion of the former route was deleted from the state highway system. Previously, the roadway extended beyond the current western terminus and functioned as a ramp to westbound US 82; this ramp was eventually obliterated, as originally proposed by TxDOT to AASHTO, though its footprint is still visible past the barricades and fencing.

Burt won two bronze medals, in the giant slalom and super-G, but failed to finish his other events. Prior to the 1998 Winter Paralympics in Nagano, Japan, Burt, and other members of the British team, experienced difficulties in obtaining funding for their training. In 1996 UK Sport, which replaced the Sports Council of Great Britain, became responsible for distributing National Lottery grant money.

Life He was born at Leicester in 1634, and baptised on 27 March. His father was a mercer. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, and graduated B.A. in 1653, M.A. in 1657. His first preferment was as rector of Beeby, Leicestershire. On the resignation of John Bryan, the nonconformist vicar of Trinity Church, Coventry, Wanley was instituted his successor on 28 October 1662. Wanley kept in touch with the prevailing Puritanism of Coventry. With Bryan, who attended his services though ministering also to a nonconformist congregation, he was intimate, and on Bryan's death in 1676 he preached his funeral sermon of warm appreciation. It was published posthumously, with the title ‘Peace and Rest for the Upright,’ 1681. Wanley died in 1680; he was succeeded by Samuel Barton on 22 December. Wanley gave or bequeathed to the grammar school library at Coventry a copy of the Imitatio Christi, described as ‘Ecclesiastical Music, written on Parchment, about the time of King Edward IV.’ Works His first publication, ‘Vox Dei, or the Great Duty of Self-reflection upon a Man's own Wayes,’ 1658, was dedicated to Dorothy Spencer, Countess of Sunderland. He published ‘War and Peace Reconciled … two books,’ 1670 and 1672, a translation from the Latin of Justus Lipsius. Wanley's major work is ‘The Wonders of the Little World; or a General History of Man. In Six Books,’ 1678, dedicated (17 June 1677) to Sir Harbottle Grimston, 2nd Baronet. The work, which is meant to illustrate anecdotically the prodigies of human nature, shows wide reading but is credulous; authorities are fully given and referenced. Later editions include that of 1774, with revision, and index; and 1806–7, 2 vols., with additions by William Johnston who worked with John Aikin on the General Biography. Wanley also compiled a history of the Fielding family, which is printed in John Nichols's Leicestershire. Family He was married on 24 July 1655; by his wife Ellen (b. 30 April 1633, d. 28 June 1719), daughter of Humphrey Burton, coroner and town clerk of Coventry, he had five children, among them Humfrey Wanley.

Only partially domesticated and very rare in cultivation outside of its native range, it is also known as kokoua or huou. Solanum repandum will apparently hybridize with a number of close relatives, including the South American naranjilla, pseudolulo, and Solanum candidum, along with the Solanum lasiocarpum, from India. Solanum repandum is, in fact, so similar in growth habit and in its fruit that it has been possibly considered a subspecies of either Solanum quitoense (naranjilla) or Solanum lasiocarpum. The three species are native to different geographical areas, and tolerate slightly different climatic conditions, but their overall habit of growth is nearly identical, as is the use for the fruit in local cuisines. Each of them features a unique ring of emerald green juice surrounding the seeds in fruit that otherwise ripen to yellow or orange. The immature fruit is covered is bristles, which detach easily upon full ripening. Like many of its relatives, S. repandum is a close relative of other nightshades cultivated for their edible fruit, including the tomato (S. lycopersicum), the naranjilla (S. quitoense) and the eggplant (S. melongena). It will readily hybridize with Solanum candidum, Solanum quitoense (naranjilla), Solanum lasiocarpum (Indian nightshade), and Solanum sessiliflorum (cocona), though in some cases those hybrids are sterile. Scientifically, S. repandum is of additional scientific interest, as is S. candidum, as they appear to be the closest relatives and a possible link species between the Asian and South American members of the same botanical clade. Distribution and habitat Solanum repandum is presumed to be native to a wide areas scattered around the archipelagos of the southern Pacific. Like the cocona, naranjilla, and Indian nightshade, S. candidium can bear fruit within 1 or 2 years from seed. A short-lived perennial, fruit production requires a rather long growing season, which limits its agricultural potential in more temperate climates, though hybridization and breeding might make this a species worthy of further investigation. Like most edible nightshades, the S. repandum is attractive to pests like aphids, white flies, beetles, and spider mites, all of which can likewise destroy naranjillas and coconas quickly.

Thieves Like Us consider themselves a pop group.Thieves Like Us Music . RCRD LBL The band are noted for their strict branding, with all releases following the same format for their covers and associated music videos, the latter created personally by Andy Grier by chopping up films from 1970s European cinema to impressionistic effect. In its early days the band was a trio consisting of Andy Grier (vocals), and Swedish musicians Pontus Berghe (drums) and Björn Berglund (keyboards), who met the American Grier in Berlin's Mauerpark in 2002.Biography on Seayou Records website. They started DJing together and eventually began producing their own electronic music. After several years self-producing (including the release of the instrumental and semi-ambient \\"Berlin, Alex\\") they were discovered by the French imprint Kitsuné who released their first commercial single, \\"Drugs In My Body\\", in 2007. 2008's \\"Play Music\\", their second album, was released under Shelflife Records and was recorded in Berlin, London, New York City and Stockholm given the band members were spread across multiple continents.Lou Thomas (20 May 2009) BBC Review: Thieves Like Us- Play Music. BBC.co.uk. Retrieved 18 April 2011. Their third album, \\"Again And Again\\", featuring popular track Never Known Love, was released in 2010. After moving labels to Captured Tracks, \\"Berlin, Alex\\" was reissued (stylised as \\"Berlin Alex\\", and with a different cover) and the band begun work on their fourth album, Bleed Bleed Bleed, a darker and somewhat political album with less of the electronica influence of their earlier work. It was at this point that backing vocalists Martine Duverglas and Anna De Marco, and drummer Dani Imhoff, were added to the lineup, with Duverglas taking an equal role alongside Grier on vocal duties on this fourth album. Existential conflict within the trio and weak marketing by the label (alleged by Grier) upon the album's release in 2012 led to poor sales and both Berghe and Berglund left, leading to a hasty tour staffed mostly by session musicians. After writing several more songs the next year Grier recruited the British Thomas Franklin from the Berlin bar 'Sameheads' where Grier was working as a bartender and Berliner Tore Knipping through a friend, before touring extensively with the new material and heading back in the studio to record the self-titled Thieves Like Us, which was released in January 2017 to positive comments from Pitchfork and Consequence Of Sound. This was preceded by a cover of Blood Orange's \\"Sutphin Boulevard\\" and an accompanying video.

Biography  A school trip in the 1970s to Captain James Cook’s Birthplace Museum started a lifelong interest in maritime art and history for James Taylor. Taylor was educated at the Universities of St Andrews and Manchester. Early in his career, Taylor spent time as an auctioneer with Phillips Fine Art Auctioneers, where he was the Victorian paintings specialist. From 1989, he was a curator of paintings, drawings and prints, exhibition organiser and Corporate Membership Manager at the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich.James Taylor, Conway Publishing. He began to publish on marine art in the mid 1990s. Taylor has since written several books, including illustrated histories on maritime and yachting art, and, in 2008, 'The Voyage of the Beagle', charting the story of the ship made famous by Charles Darwin. In March 2009, Dr John Van Wyhe wrote in BBC History Magazine, that 'The Voyage of the Beagle' ‘brings together a wonderful mixture of old and new illustrations and information about the voyage from wildly scattered sources.’John Van Wyhe, BBC History Magazine, March 2009. He has also produced a study on the popular English 20th century cartoonist and Punch magazine editor, Fougasse, who created the anti-rumour and gossip posters during World War II. His publication Your Country Needs You - The Secret History of the Propaganda Poster (Saraband, August 2013) was timed to coincide with the start of the World War I commemorations in 2014. Dazzle - Disguise & Disruption in War & Art and Pack Up Your Troubles - How Humorous Postcards Helped to Win World War One were published in September and October 2016 by The Pool of London Press and Bloomsbury respectively. Taylor guest-curated the exhibition 'Dazzle - Disguise and Disruption in War and Art' at the St Barbe Museum & Art Gallery in Lymington (16 June -23 September 2018) that included loans from private and public collections including: the British Museum, Imperial War Museum, National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, Russell-Cotes, Southampton City Art Gallery, Tate Britain and the V & A. Also, co-organised the Dazzle study day at the University of Southampton on 30 June 2018. See: https://www.southampton.ac.uk/greatwar_unknownwar/news/events/2018/06/30-dazzle- study-day.page Awards and recognition Among Taylor’s professional achievements are several Sir James Caird Awards for writing, and the Sir Geoffrey Callender Award for outstanding achievement in supporting the public lecture programme and developing the corporate membership scheme of the National Maritime Museum. Since 1999, he has worked as a freelance writer and lecturer. In 2001, he was appointed an official lecturer for the National Association of Decorative and Fine Arts Societies (NADFAS), now renamed The Arts Society. According to the Mere Literary Festival, Taylor ‘lectures regularly to a wide range of societies, including NADFAS [The Arts Society] around the world.’James Taylor , Mere Literary Festival, UK, 2009. https://theartssociety.org/about-us In June 2015 Taylor was awarded a PhD from the University of Sussex for his thesis on William Westall (1781-1850) the 'landscape and figure draughtsman' who sailed with Matthew Flinders on the voyage of HMS Investigator (1801-3) – the first recorded circumnavigation of Australia. His publication The Voyage of the Beagle... was short-listed for the Mountbatten Maritime Prize in 2016.http://www.bmcf.org.uk/awards/nominations-2016/ Taylor is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts.

A typical traditional pack of playing cards consists of up to 52 regular cards, organized into 4 suits, and optionally some additional cards meant for playing, such as jokers or tarot trumps. The cards of each suit typically form a hierarchy of ranks. However, some traditional packs, especially from Asia, follow a different scheme. French suited packs French-suited cards are the most popular design and can be found in most countries. Historically, kings were the highest cards and aces were the lowest, and this hierarchy is sometimes still prescribed for cutting. Aces are now the most common high card in most games. In Ace–Ten card games such as Pinochle, tens have the second-highest card-point value and therefore tend to rank high between ace and king rather than in their natural position. Other common high cards are twos, threes, and jacks. =Full French-suited pack= The full French-suited pack contains 52 cards, organized into the 4 French card suits spades, clubs, diamonds and hearts and 13 ranks. The modern common hierarchy is ace > king > queen > jack > 10 > 9 > 8 > 7 > 6 > 5 > 4 > 3 > 2, i.e. aces are high and twos are low. Many decks in France and Belgium use the numeral \\"1\\" for the ace. Full French-suited packs often contain anywhere from one to four jokers with two being the most common, which are needed for some games. Zwicker decks come with six jokers. Jokers have neither suit nor rank. Some packs are sold with accessories needed for specific games like cribbage boards, bidding boxes, or cut cards. Double packs (2x52 plus jokers) and triple packs (3x52 plus jokers) with the same back designs are sold for Canasta and Samba. These decks may contain point values marked on the cards. =Stripped French-suited packs= 24-card stripped decks are often sold in Germany and Austria for Schnapsen. These decks go from nines to aces in each suit. Doubled versions of this deck (2x24) are used to play Pinochle and Doppelkopf. 32-card packs have ranks seven through ace in each suit and are very common in Europe. They are used to play Piquet, Belote, Skat, Klaverjas, and Préférence. Doubled decks (2x32) are sold for Bezique. They are sometimes known as Piquet packs. 36-card packs go from ranks six through ace in each suit. This pack is in use in western Switzerland as the French-suited Jass pack and is quite common in Russia for playing Durak. It was once used to play Piquet until the sixes were dropped. 40-card packs are found mostly in Latin countries where they compete against local Italian or Spanish suited decks. These sets range from two to seven and jack to ace in each suit. An exception is Portugal where the ranks go from two to six, eight, and jack to ace. =Expanded French-suited pack= 63-card packs are produced for playing the six-handed version of 500, a variant of Euchre. These decks add elevens, twelves, red thirteens, and a single joker to the standard 52 card pack. The decks are mostly sold in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. =French-suited Tarot packs= The 78-card Tarot Nouveau deck is the most widely used set for Tarot card games in France, Belgium, Denmark, and parts of Switzerland. A full set contains the standard 52 cards plus a Knight face card for each suit ranking between the Queen and Jack. Aces are marked with \\"1\\" and are the lowest ranked cards. There are 21 numbered trump cards and one unnumbered and suitless card, The Fool, which excuses the player from following suit. The 54-card Cego and Industrie und Glück decks omit the aces through sixes in black suits and fives through tens in the red suits. They are found in Germany, Switzerland, and throughout the former Austro-Hungarian empire. In games played with these decks, The Fool is part of the trump suit. Plain suit cards don't have corner indexes. German suited packs German-suited cards are still common in large parts of Central Europe, although they generally compete with French-suited cards, which are often more popular. =Full German-suited pack= Full German-suited packs are largely confined to southern Germany and Austria where Bavarian Tarock, Tapp, Bauerntarock and Jass are played. They contain 36 cards, organized into the four German suits of Acorns, Leaves, Hearts and Bells and 9 ranks. The role of the Queen is played by another male figure, the Ober, and that of the Jack by the Unter. The Ober has its suit sign placed in a high position and the Unter in a lower position. Aces are styled as Deuces. The modern natural hierarchy is Ace > King > Ober > Unter > Ten > 9 > 8 > 7 > 6, i.e. Aces are high. In Austria and South Tyrol, the Six of Bells is often used as a wild card known as the Weli. Bavarian pattern pack Italian manufacturers also started producing 40-card packs for South Tyrol since the 1980s. This set includes the 5s which allows players to play Italian card games that require 40 cards. Austrian Piatnik 33-card pack =Standard German-suited pack= This is a German-suited pack without the sixes, as used for many Central European games such as Skat, Schafkopf and Sixty-Six / Mariáš. Some packs add the Six of Bells to make it into a 33-card deck. =Stripped German-suited packs= 24-card sets are available for Schnapsen. They go from ranks nine to ace in each deck. The doubled deck version (2x24) is used for Doppelkopf. Another doubled deck version for Binokel and Gaigel replaces rank nine with sevens. Swiss suited packs Swiss-suited cards are used only in part of the German- speaking area of Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Locally they are known as \\"German\\" cards. =Jass pack= The only frequently encountered Swiss-suited pack is known as the Jass pack. It contains 36 cards and is very similar to the southern German-suited pack. The main difference is that instead of leaves and hearts there are shields and roses, and the ten is styled as a banner. =Kaiser pack= The 48-card Kaiser pack is only produced to play Kaiserspiel, which requires 40 or 48 cards. If the banner and deuce are regarded as a ten and ace, the pack is equivalent to an extended Jass pack. If the banner and deuce are regarded as ace and deuce, the pack is equivalent to a full Spanish-suited pack. Spanish suited packs Spanish-suited cards are used in most Spanish-speaking countries and in the south of Italy. =Full Spanish-suited pack= The full Spanish-suited pack contains 48 cards, organized into the 4 Spanish suits swords, clubs, cups and coins and 12 ranks. These decks usually include two jokers. The court cards are usually numbered. The role of the queen is played by the caballo (cavalier), visually distinct from the sota (jack) by riding a horse. The common ranking from to low to high is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, jack (10), cavalier (11), king (12), and ace (1). =Standard Spanish-suited pack= The standard Spanish-suited pack consists of 40 cards in the ranks ace, king, cavalier, jack and 2–7. Standard Spanish- suited pack of 40 cards French Catalan pattern-style cards =Spanish-suited Tarot pack= The uncommon 64-card Tarocco Siciliano set uses Spanish styled straight swords and crude clubs like other southern Italian decks. It omits the Two and Three of coins, and numerals one to four in clubs, swords and cups. One card, the Ace of Coins, is almost never used as it was added solely for the purpose of the stamp tax. It is one of the rare sets to feature female knaves. Italian suited packs Italian-suited cards are used only in the north of Italy. =Full Italian-suited pack= The full Italian-suited pack contains 52 cards, organized into the 4 Spanish suits swords, batons, cups and coins and 13 ranks. It is very similar to the full Spanish-suited pack, but does have tens as pip cards. =Standard Italian-suited pack= Like the standard Spanish-suited pack, the standard Italian-suited pack consists of 40 cards in the ranks ace, king, cavalier, knave and 2–7. =Italian-suited Tarot packs= Italian game packs are largely confined to Italy and parts of Switzerland. Among them, the 78-card Tarocco Piemontese is the most popular. Each suit now includes the Queen between the King and Knight. The hierarchy of the pip cards depends on its suit. The Fool is labelled 0 while trump 20 is usually the strongest, even beating trump 21. A rarer 78-card set is the Swiss 1JJ Tarot found in a few pockets in Switzerland. Despite using Italian suits, the trumps labelled in French. The 62-card Tarocco Bolognese omits pip cards 2 to 5, has Ace instead of 1, and makes the bottom four of the trumps equal in rank. It is used to play Tarocchini. Ganjifa packs The Ganjifa packs are associated with India and Persia. They are typically hand painted and many different designs are known. The suits vary and can number 8, 10, 12 or more. A feature of Ganjifa cards is that they are often circular, although rectangular designs also exist. Hanafuda pack The Japanese Hanafuda pack contains 48 cards. There are 12 suits representing months, and three ranks: normal, poetry ribbon and special. Every normal card exists twice.

The gravestone bears a copy of several bars of the autograph manuscript and the inscription \\"... with his strength gone, and his heart in the dust, like a tree ...\\"[sic], borrowed from the chorus. The Wandering Madman (in Czech: Potulný šílenec, JW 4/43) is a choral composition for soprano, tenor, baritone and male chorus, written in 1922 by the Czech composer Leoš Janáček to the words of a poem by Rabindranath Tagore. It was inspired by Tagore's 1921 lecture in Czechoslovakia. The Wandering Madman is considered one of the most important of Janáček's choral works.  Background and structure  In June 1921, Janáček attended a lecture in Prague given by Tagore. He later mentioned the lecture in an article for the Lidové noviny newspaper. He took down the writer's \\"speech melodies\\" and apparently found an inspiration in his poems. The next year, from July to November, he composed a choral work based on a poem by Tagore. The poem was translated to the Czech language under the title Potulný šílenec (transl. F. Balej). The Wandering Madman premiered in Rosice u Brna on 21 September 1924 in a performance by Pěvecké sdružení moravských učitelů (PSMU) (The Choral Society of Moravian Teachers) with soprano solo Eliška Janečková and conductor Ferdinand Vach. The same year, the composition was performed with the composer in attendance in Prague's Mozarteum, as a part of a concert organized by the Prague Conservatory. The composition is scored for soprano, tenor, baritone and TTBB choir. The duration of the work is approximately five minutes. The autograph is dated 12 November 1922. The Janáček specialist Alena Němcová wrote about the composition: \\"Janáček in this work examines the human fate and looks back on the extremely difficult finding his own way, in which each step was a step of fierce searching. In the fate of the wandering madman, who again looks for a \\"touchstone\\", we see a true picture of Janáček's life...\\" The gravestone of the Janáček's grave at the Central Cemetery in Brno bears a copy of several bars of the autograph manuscript and the inscription \\"... with his strength gone, and his heart in the dust, like a tree ...\\", borrowed from the work.

Thanks to a long-term effort on the part of the city, the school system has been involved in a consolidation effort, bringing the total number of elementary schools down from twenty-eight as recently as the 1990s to nine today: Spencer Borden Elementary in the southern Highlands, John J. Doran Elementary in the downtown area, Mary L. Fonseca Elementary in the Flint, William S. Greene Elementary near the city's center, Alfred S. Letourneau in the Maplewood neighborhood, Frank M. Silvia Elementary in the far North End, James Tansey Elementary in the middle Highlands, Carlton M. Viveiros Elementary in the South End, and Samuel Watson Elementary in the lower Flint. Of the old twenty-eight, only Watson, Tansey and Doran remain in their original buildings; Silvia was relocated from its old location downtown to a new building in the northern part of the city, and the other five were rebuilt on the sites of their original schools. Also, most of the closed school names (except for Wiley and Dubuque) live on in the schools they were consolidated into.Names of closed city schools will live on - WickedLocal.com There are three middle schools: Matthew J. Kuss Middle School (which was relocated to the west side of the city), James Morton Middle School (serving the North End), and Edmond P. Talbot Middle School (serving the east side of the city). The site of the former Henry Lord Middle School now serves as an elementary and middle school named Henry Lord Community School. The city has one public high school, B.M.C. Durfee High School. The school was founded in 1886, replacing an older high school. The original grand school building was a gift of Mrs. Mary B. Young, in the name of Bradford Matthew Chaloner Durfee, her late son, whose name also graces a dormitory at Yale University. The current school building was opened in 1978, and it was recently announced that a replica of the Durfee Chimes, the original school's red-capped bell tower, will be recreated on the grounds. Durfee's teams wear black and red (in honor of the old school's black roof and red observatory dome and tower spire), and are called the Hilltoppers, sometimes shortened to Toppers. The nickname dates back to the old school's perch on top of the hill north of the Quequechan River. The school is a member of the Big Three Conference, where it competes with Brockton High School and its longtime natural rival, New Bedford High School.

It is said that in copying the originals of his master, he attained so high a degree of excellence, that such of his pieces as were retouched by Titian, bid defiance often to the judgment of the most expert connoisseurs. He also produced works of his own design; the altar-piece attributed to him at San Giovanni Nuovo, representing SS. Cosmo and Damianus, reflects credit on the school to which he belonged.

Plot Drug dealer Jarvis Tanner (Clint Howard) uses steroids to enhance marijuana plants. Run-off from his operation has mutated the local ticks. Tyler Burns (Seth Green) is sent to join an inner-city wilderness project in an attempt to conquer his fear of the woods, led by Holly Lambert (Rosalind Allen) and Charles Danson (Peter Scolari). Tyler meets his fellow campers Darrel “Panic” Lumley (Alphonso Ribeiro), Charles’ daughter Melissa (Virginya Keeyne), Dee Dee Davenport (Ami Dolenz), Rome Hernandez (Ray Oriel), and Kelly Mishimoto (Sina Dayrit). They stop at a store to get supplies. While there, Melissa is confronted by Sir (Michael Medeiros) and Jerry (Barry Lynch), two locals. Jerry harasses Melissa, but is told to leave her alone by Sir. Jarvis’ hamster is killed by a tick. When Jarvis investigates, he is attacked by a tick before stepping into a bear trap and has several tick eggs drop on him. The group arrives at camp. While in their cabin, Tyler, Panic, and Rome discover a tick egg, which Tyler destroys. While taking a hike, Melissa is attacked by a tick which Tyler fends off. When Ryler and Melissa inform Charles, he dismisses them. Panic’s dog Brutus is attacked and killed by another tick. Upset, Panic leaves camp. Tyler takes Brutus’s body to a veterinarian, who discovers a tick inside Brutus. The tick, still alive, runs around the room until the veterinarian kills it. Panic, while walking in the woods, is attacked by a tick. He pulls most of it off, but its head burrows inside him. While fishing, Kelly and Mellissa discover Sheriff Parker’s (Rance Howard) corpse. Didi finds Jarvis, who has amputated his legs and had ticks burrow inside him. Jarvis is caught in another bear trap and his face explodes, causing a tick to latch on to Didi, but Tyler kills it. Panic stumbles onto Sir and Jerry’s marijuana farm, and Sir shoots Panic, but accidentally causes a propane tank to explode, causing a forest fire. The group takes shelter from the raging fire in the cabin. Charles lets Sir and Jerry in, but a wounded Panic arrives and tells the group that Sir shot him before dying. Sir shoots Charles while Jerry attempts to take the van. A tick kills Jerry, who crashes the car into the cabin, injuring Sir. A large tick emerges from Panic’s corpse and mauls Sir. Tyler drives the van outside the window, but the large tick attacks Rome. Tyler lights it on fire, killing it, and the survivors drive back into civilization. At a junkyard, a pulsating tick egg falls from underneath the van.

He was particularly skilled in traditional styles and was highly involved in the restoration of historic buildings, researching his subjects well before any project. Biography The grave of John Kinross, Grange Cemetery, Edinburgh He was born in Shore Road in Stirling, the second son of William Kinross (1810-1874), a builder and owner of William Kinross and Sons, and his second wife, Ann Marshall. He was educated at Stirling High School. Kinross was articled to Glasgow architect John Hutchison around 1870, and moved to the Edinburgh firm of Wardrop and Reid in 1875. He travelled to Italy in 1880 to study Renaissance buildings. In 1882 Kinross he established a partnership with Henry Seymour, which lasted until 1889. At this time he lived at 15 Leven Street in the Tollcross district.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1883 Kinross was president of the Edinburgh Architectural Association (EAA) between 1890 and 1892, and was elected to the Royal Scottish Academy in 1905. Ebenezer James MacRae trained under him in 1908. He completed many commissions for the Scottish Episcopal Church in his early years. During the 1890s he developed a style strongly influenced by Scottish architecture of the 17th century. He carried out extensive research to complete a number of important restorations, including Falkland Palace and the 15th-century Priory Church in South Queensferry. Several commissions came from the 3rd Marquis of Bute, an enthusiastic restorer. He also carried out numerous domestic commissions, among the most important was his rebuilding of Manderston in Berwickshire (1901–1905). After 1905 he experienced a decline in commissions for new houses, and began submitting competition proposals. After the First World War he completed several war memorials, and also contributed time to Edinburgh College of Art. He suffered a breakdown in 1920, but continued in practice, and continued his involvement with the RSA.

Though imprisoned for his teachings, he avoided charges of blasphemy by signing a recantation. Life and work Robins, a ranter, was a man of little education. By his own account, \\"As for humane learning, I never had any; my Hebrew, Greek, and Latine comes by inspiration\\". He appears to have been a small farmer, owning some land. This he sold, and, coming to London with his wife Mary (or Joan) Robins, was known in 1650 to Lodowicke Muggleton (1609–1698) and John Reeve (1608–1658) as someone claiming to be something greater than a prophet. He was commonly spoken of as \\"the ranters' god\\" and \\"the shakers' god\\", and was effectively deified by his followers. His wife expected to become the mother of a Messiah. Robins probably viewed himself as an incarnation of the divine being; he asserted that he had appeared on earth before, as Adam, and as Melchizedek. He claimed a power of raising the dead. Robins put forward a scheme for leading a host of 144,000 persons to the Holy Land; Joshua Garment was to be his Moses for this expedition; the volunteers were prepared by a vegetarian diet of dry bread, raw vegetables, and water. Robins publicly declared that \\"the Lord Jesus was a weak and Imperfect Saviour, and afraid of death\\", unlike himself who had no fear of death.Tristram, Stuart. (2006). John Robins: The Shaker's God. In The Bloodless Revolution: Radical Vegetarians and the Discovery of India. HarperCollins. pp. 15-25. Robins acted as a cult leader and promised his followers he would lead them to the Mount of Olives in the Holy Land of Jerusalem where he would feed them on manna from heaven. He also stated he would part the water of the English channel and march his followers over dry land to bliss and safety. On 24 May 1651 Robins, his wife, and eight of his followers were apprehended at a meeting in Long Alley, Moorfields, and jailed in the New Bridewell at Clerkenwell, where three other disciples were sent to join them. During three days they held a kind of public reception of the \\"gentry and citizens\\" who \\"resorted thither to dispute with them\\". Robins reduced his former claim to one of inspiration, and rested his hopes of salvation on the merits of our Lord; his followers stoutly maintained his higher pretensions. Among the disputants was \\"an Oxford scholar\\", who referred to the previous fanaticism of William Hacket, Edmund Coppinger, and Henry Arthington, giving this last name as Arthingworth, perhaps because among the followers of Robins was a Mary Arthingworth. Robins remained in prison for more than ten months. On 5 February 1652, Reeve and Muggleton, who had just received their own \\"commissions\\" as prophets, visited Robins in his Clerkenwell prison, and passed sentence of eternal damnation upon him. The scene is graphically narrated by Muggleton. Robins said afterwards that he felt \\"a burning in his throat\\", and heard an inward voice bidding him recant. Accordingly, about two months later, he addressed to Oliver Cromwell, the Lord Protector of England at the time, a letter of recantation, and as a result was freed. Afterwards, he returned to the country, repurchased his land, and lived quietly. Though he professed to expect to \\"come forth with a greater power\\", he was not heard of again. Vegetarianism Robins was one of the earliest vegetarians in England. Robins claimed he was the third Adam and that his followers should eat a vegetable diet like Adam did before the fall of man. Robins also condemned the use of alcohol as a poisonous liquor. Robin commanded his followers to eat a strict vegetable diet and abstain from meat until they should be fed with manna from heaven. Some of his followers starved to death on this diet. See also *Thomas Tany (1608 - 1659), a disciple of Robins.

Although Lebanese Mexicans made up less than 5% of the total immigrant population in Mexico during the 1930s, they constituted half of the immigrant economic activity. Lebanese influence in Mexican culture can be seen most particularly in Mexican cuisine, where they have introduced many foods and dishes and created their own recipes such as al pastor. Interethnic marriage in the Lebanese community, regardless of religious affiliation, is very high; most have only one parent with Lebanese ethnicity. As a result, some of them speak Arabic fluently. But the majority, especially among younger generations, speak Spanish as first language. Carlos Slim, formerly the richest man in the world, is an example of Lebanese Mexican success in Mexican society. Migration history Lebanese immigration to Mexico started in the 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1892, the first Lebanese arrived in Mexico from Beirut in French ships to Mexican ports such as Puerto Progreso, Jalisco and Tampico. At that time, Lebanon was not an independent nation; the territory was held by the Ottoman Empire and later became a French protectorate. Roughly 100,000 Arabic- speakers settled in Mexico during this time period. They settled in significant numbers in Yucatán, Veracruz, Puebla, Mexico City and the northern part of the country (mainly in the states of Baja California, Nuevo León, Sinaloa, Chihuahua, Coahuila, and Durango, as well as the city of Tampico and Guadalajara). Although Lebanese people made up less than 5% of the total immigrant population in Mexico during the 1930s, they constituted half of the immigrant economic activity. During the 1948 Israel-Lebanon war and the Six- Day War, thousands of Lebanese left Lebanon and went to Mexico, first arriving in Veracruz. Another concentration of Lebanese-Mexicans is in Baja California facing the US-Mexican border, especially in the cities of Mexicali and Tijuana across from San Diego with a large Lebanese-American community (about 280,000), some of whose families have relatives in Mexico. Lebanese culture in Mexico Image of Saint Charbel in a Roman Catholic church in San Luis Potosí, San Luis Potosí Statue with prayer requests at the Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral One Lebanese cultural tradition in Mexico itself is to place colored ribbons to the image of St. Charbel to ask some favor or some miracle (see Intercession of saints). The tradition arose in the Candelaria Church in Merced in the historic center of Mexico City. The immigration of Lebanese to Mexico has influenced Mexican culture, in particular food, including introducing kibbeh and tabbouleh, and even creating recipes such as tacos árabes. By 1765, dates, which originated in North Africa and the Middle East, were introduced into Mexico by the Spaniards. The fusion between Arab and Mexican food has highly influenced the Yucatecan cuisine. Religion The majority of Lebanese-Mexicans are Christians who belong to the Maronite, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Melkite Catholic confessions. The Lebanese initially practiced Catholicism independently from other Mexicans, but learned to speak Spanish; Lebanese-Mexican children quickly joined the country's mainstream religious activities. A few Lebanese Muslims settled in Mexico. They were responsible for the opening of the first mosque in Mexico, built in the city of Torreon, in Coahuila, and named Suraya.

It features the first appearance of Merlin the Magic Mouse and Second Banana, both voiced by Daws Butler. This cartoon was also final appearance of Sam Cat in a Warner Brothers. cartoon. Plot Merlin puts on a magic show but he is not really popular. Upon their entry into the auditorium, Merlin's sidekick Second Banana counts the house, where he finds only one member of the audience: a cat. He tells Merlin that there will be trouble if the cat finds out that Merlin's a mouse. Cleverly, Merlin puts on a fake moustache to disguise himself. The curtain rises and, when Merlin introduces himself, the cat boos. Second Banana is instructed to create applause using a machine that has several hands on a wheel. For his first trick, Merlin decides to pull a live rabbit from his empty hat. When Merlin puts in his hand, the rabbit bites his thumb, which causes it to throb. From the side of the stage, Second Banana tells Merlin to use the carrot. Merlin pulls out the carrot and the rabbit reaches out its paw to grab it, pulling Merlin into the hat along with him, prompting Merlin to say, \\"I shall have a talk with that rabbit later.\\" After getting his hat back to normal, Merlin proclaims that, for his next \\"feat of legerdemain,\\" he will need a volunteer from the crowd. He chooses the cat, who is incredulous, and the cat comes up on stage. Merlin informs him that he is going to saw him in half. While Second Banana retrieves the box, the cat runs away, not wanting to be sawed in half by Merlin. He trips and Merlin grabs him by the tail. Pulling him across the stage, Merlin says to the cat, \\"Get back here! It's only a trick. Besides, you've got nine lives; what have you got to lose?\\" The cat starts crying because he knows what is going to happen. He bawls, \\"You're gonna hurt my itsy-bitsy body... with a sharp saw... boo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!\\" Merlin has Second Banana go get the (rubber) saw in the trunk. Second Banana finds trick cards and magic flowers but no rubber saw, so he is forced to give Merlin a real one. Merlin starts sawing the box and Second Banana finally finds the rubber saw. Merlin throws the real one away and he apologizes to the cat. When he bends over, his mustache falls off. The cat says, \\"Hey! You're a mouse! I hate mouses!\\" The cat breaks out of the box and goes after the two mice. Merlin calls on some real magic to turn out the lights and, once the lights come back on, the cat is entangled in a locked chain. The cat chomps down on the chain, breaking it. He then goes back to the mice. They stop him and Merlin tells him that they have a gift for him, and he \\"will get a bang out of it.\\" It is actually a large piece of dynamite. The cat blows out the one fuse, not knowing there is one at the bottom. The fuse ends and it blows up. Merlin and Second Banana are still trying to run away when they get to a brick wall. Merlin pulls out his Indian trick rope and they climb up it. The cat follows but, once at the top, the mice are nowhere to be found. Merlin says that he should join them down below and he pulls the rope, causing the cat to fall to the ground. Merlin and Second Banana go out the back door. Merlin pulls out his magic carpet. He says, \\"Escadido...Atascadero...and all that jazz!\\" He flies off, but he accidentally leaves Second Banana behind. Noticing the cat is in hot pursuit, Second Banana calls for Merlin to come back to get him. Merlin returns and the two fly off, leaving the cat behind...or so they think. While in the air, Merlin asks Second Banana where their next booking is, which is revealed to be in Peoria. Merlin proclaims, \\"Peoria, here we come!\\" The cat, paddling a gravity-defying canoe-like boat suspended by balloons, remarks, \\"And Peoria, here I come!\\" Merlin then says, \\"In that case, we open in Hoboken.\\" He chuckles and the screen fades to black.

Many vendors have also moved towards opening small restaurants and shops, and \\"street food\\" is now commonly eaten indoors at established locations. Bing, a flatbread made of flour and fried in oil, was once a Northeastern street food that can also be found in many areas around the country. They can be served plain or stuffed with meat or eggs, or seasoned with scallions, sauces, or other flavours. One variety originating in Shandong and now found throughout China, jianbing guozi (煎饼果子), is made with the batter poured directly onto an iron skillet and evened out into a thin pancake.

Vegetarian dishes include sabzi kachauri (sabzi is usually spicy potato curry; kachauri can be plain as well as stuffed), dahil bhalla, and various other varieties of chaat. Certain parts of Old Delhi which include Chandani Chowk and Chawri Bazar have numerous street food vendors who have been selling street food for three or more generations.Street food in Delhi Indian Street Food in India = Indonesia = Satay stall in Indonesia Street foods are sold by hawkers peddling their goods on carts, bicycles, motorbikes, by five foot way (kaki lima) trader, or by road-side stalls with easy access from the street. The food being sold may include Indonesian food like nasi campur, nasi goreng, gado-gado, soups (such as soto ayam), satay, desserts and beverages like bubur kacang hijau, es cendol, and es cincau. In most cities, it is common to see Chinese dishes such as bakpao (steamed buns with sweet and savoury fillings), bakmie (noodles), and bakso (meatballs) sold by street vendors and restaurants, often adapted to become Indonesian-Chinese cuisine. One common adaptation is that pork is rarely used since the majority of Indonesians are Muslims. =Nepal= Nepalese street foods mainly includes momo (dumpling), cephali, fried potato, fish, chicken drumstick (poultry), alu-paratha (chapati with boiled and crushed potato inside), pakoda, sausage, panipuri, chatpate, different types of chat, paan, and various other Nepali dishes. = Pakistan = Some of the common items in Pakistan include bun kabab sandwiches, samosas, kulfi ice cream, popcorn, fried or grilled fish, sugar cane juice, chickpea juice (sutthu), lemonade (limno paani), sliced coconut, dried fruits and nuts (almonds, peanuts, walnuts, figs, pine nuts, etc.), haleem, biryani, pakoras, falsa fruit (Grewia asiatica), grilled chicken (chicken charga), french fries (often called 'finger chips'), paan, gol guppay, spiced chickpeas (chana masala) and papri chaat. = Philippines = Street foods in Manila, Philippines.

Canal food has been sold from boats on Thailand's rivers and canals for over two centuries, but since the early 20th century King Rama V's modernizations have caused a shift towards land-based stalls. In Bangkok parlance, a housewife who feeds her family from a street food vendor is known as a \\"plastic-bag housewife\\", which originated from streets vendors packaging the food in plastic bags. = Vietnam = Street vendors, like these two in Ho Chi Minh City, often set out tables and plastic stools for customers. Pho was originally sold from elaborate carrying poles. From the pole hung two wooden cabinets, one housing a cauldron over a wood fire, the other storing noodles, spices, cookware, and space to prepare a bowl of pho. Today, however, pho is usually sold at fixed stands surrounded by tables and stools.  Europe  = Balkans = Buregdžinica in Zagreb Street food in the Balkans is heavily influenced by the cuisine of the Ottoman Empire. Variations of the burek, a filled flaky pastry, are common throughout Turkey and the Balkans. Ćevapi is a sort of kebab served in Yugoslavia and Romania, where it is called mititei. Pljeskavica, a grilled dish of spiced meat patty mixture of pork, beef and lamb, is also very popular. = Benelux = In the Netherlands and Belgium, french fries are served with sauces such as mayonnaise, ketchup, curry, or tartar sauce (the latter mainly in Belgium).

In Belgium, French fries are traditionally fried in suet (beef fat) but this has become less common and people tend to fry them in oil. Liège-style waffles (Dutch wafel or French gaufre) are served warm as a street snack, somewhat similar to what is known in other countries as \\"Belgian waffles\\" (which are called in Belgium \\"Gaufres de Bruxelles\\" or \\"Brusselse Wafels\\") but richer, denser and sweeter. The pancake is fluffier than the French crêpe or the Russian blin. =Czech Republic= The most common and traditional Czech street food is smažený sýr, which is a soft piece of cheese deep-fried and served on a hamburger bun. = Denmark = A Pølsevogn (sausage wagon) in Kolding City, Denmark. In Denmark, one can purchase sausages and hot dogs from sausage wagons. These are technically considered hot dog stands and are one of the most popular food trucks in the country. =Finland= A porilainen sandwich In Finland, street food can mostly be found at market squares and kiosks, although hamburger chains Hesburger, McDonald's, and Burger King are also available. A variety of savoury pastries such as lihapiirakka and karjalanpiirakka, and sweet pastries such as pulla, usually served with coffee, are very common. Fish stands at the market squares also serve gravlax on rye bread as an open sandwich or loimulohi. Regional specialties sold at the market squares include sultsina and kalakukko. In addition to hamburgers and hot dogs, Finnish meat pastries with sausages are available at kiosks, especially a sausage sandwich called a porilainen. Condiments include ketchup, Finnish mustard, pickle relish, mayonnaise, and mustard relish, as well as lettuce, tomato, and onion. Other common late night street food fare found at kiosks are doner kebabs, Finnish meatballs (lihapulla), and french fries with condiments. = France = In France, sandwiches are a common street food. Most of them are baguette bread sandwiches with different kinds of fillings such as \\"jambon/beurre\\" (ham with butter), \\"jambon/fromage\\" (ham with cheese) or \\"poulet/crudités\\" (chicken with vegetables). Crêpes are another common French street food. A crêpe complète containing ham, shredded cheese, and an egg provides a filling lunch. Sweet crêpes or waffles are sold with Nutella and banana or Grand Marnier and sugar. Other street foods include pizza, kebab-type sandwiches and panini, a grilled and pressed sandwich. During the winter, roasted chestnuts can be bought. = Germany = Bratwurst and Glühwein in Garmisch Bavarian Fleischkäse (also called Leberkäse), is similar to meatloaf, sliced to the thickness of a finger and generally served with either hot mustard or sweet mustard in a roll. Germany is also known for its various types of sausage, as well as the recent hybrid curry-sausage, currywurst. French fries (pommes in German, derived from French but pronounced according to German orthographic rules) are popular, served with ketchup and/or mayonnaise, and sometimes with sausage. In northern Germany rolls with pickled or smoked fish (e.g. matjes) are also a common snack, occasionally sold out of mobile smoke houses. Beer is sold at all sidewalk snack stands, which usually feature beers and small bottles of whiskey, schnapps, or vodka. Turkish-influenced street foods include shawarma and Döner. North African stalls sell shawarma, falafel and halumi. = Hungary = Street food is not particularly common in Hungary, although gyros shops are becoming more common. Rétes (strudel) is fairly common, and lángos (a deep fried bread) is usually available at markets and during celebrations. In general, Hungarians looking for quick food will stop to sit down and eat, even if only at a Chinese buffet or a főzelékfaló (vegetable purée bar). = Italy = Pizza al taglio shop in Rome The most notable Italian street food is pizza, sold in take-aways and bakeries. Take-away pizza (or pizza al taglio) is quite different from pizzeria pizza. Unlike the round pizza normally found in restaurants, which originated in Naples as a street food itself, it is generally baked on large square trays, and square or rectangular portions are sold. It usually has quite a thick base, again unlike the traditional Italian restaurant pizza. Toppings include margherita, mushrooms, Italian sausage, ham, and vegetables. Other street foods are the Genoese focaccia di recco (a double layer of thin dough filled with quark cheese and baked); farinata (a thin, baked chickpea-flour batter, topped with salt, pepper and olive oil), which is often served with focaccia (a thin bread, also with salt and olive oil); Florentine trippa and lampredotto (ox stomach cooked in a seasoned broth and served in a bread roll); and Roman supplì; (rice balls filled with cheese and/or various fillings, covered in egg and breadcrumbs and deep fried), which is similar to Sicilian arancini, where the usual filling is a meat sauce with green peas. Pani ca meusa served in a rotisserie in Palermo In Palermo, a street food would be Pani ca meusa (bread rolls with sliced, cooked pork spleen), and \\"panelle\\", deep-fried chickpea flour batter. In central Italy porchetta is common, which is a spicy roasted pork meat (from the whole, boned animal), usually served in a panino (bread roll). In Naples, fried food stalls, friggitorie, sell filled, deep-fried pastries and other foods. A street food made of offal, commonly found in fairs and religious festivals in Naples and in the whole of Campania, is the 'O pere e 'o musso (\\"the paw and the muzzle\\"): calves' heads and pigs' feet are boiled, sliced and chopped, then seasoned with salt and lemon juice. This is also called musso re puorco (\\"pork muzzle\\"), although only calf heads are normally used. In Lecce popular snacks are Rustico, a salty snack made of puff pastry filled with besciamella, tomato sauce and pepper and Pasticciotto (sweet pastry usually filled with egg custard but also varieties with chocolate, cherries, lemon). Vendors sell watermelons during the summer months, as well as roasted chestnuts (caldarroste) stalls during the winter, and especially before Christmas. Rosticcerie, while most often selling food to be eaten at home, also sometimes have a counter for immediate consumption of their goods, the most common of which are roast chicken, roast potatoes, fried polenta and other accompaniments. Substantial immigration from Turkey and the Middle East has also gained shawarma (best known in Italy as kebab) an increasing popularity, as well as other middle-eastern traditional dishes. Gelato (ice cream) and granita are commonly available. In the Romagna subregion, and especially in the Forlì-Cesena province, a flatbread called piadina is available. It is sold in kiosks, usually as a sandwich filled with mixed cold cut meats, cheese, and/or vegetables. A common variant is the crescione, a piadina cooked like a turnover; in this version the most common filling are tomato sauce with mozzarella, and pumpkin with boiled potato and sausage. = Malta = Pastizzi are small, ricotta cheese- or pea-paste- filled puff-pastry squares that can be bought from vendors in practically every village in Malta. Ricotta pastizzi (pastizzi tal-irkotta) are diamond-shaped with a hole in the middle where the ricotta stuffing can be seen, while pea pastizzi (pastizzi tal-pizelli) are of the same shape but are more like an envelope of puff pastry with no holes. The shops selling these pastries are called pastizzeriji. They also sell items such as pies, pizza al taglio, sausage rolls, baked rice, baked macaroni (timpana), and sometimes arancini. Another local street food found in such pastizzerias is the \\"qassatat\\". This is a ball-shaped pie crust with an open top, with the same two basic fillings of ricotta or peas, and sometimes a tuna and spinach mixture. Imqaret are deep fried pastries filled with a mashed date mixture. Hamburgers, hot dogs, and other such products being sold from vans, replace perennial Maltese favorites such as Ħobż biż-żejt, bigilla, and timpana. Ħobż biż-żejt is usually bought from the inside of shops rather than stalls. This is the local sandwich, made from a local flat-bun called a ftira or a rounder one called hbejza which is filled with various ingredients available at the counter displays. The basic Ħobż biż-żejt recipe consists of filling the bread with oil and kunserva (tomato paste), tuna fish, pickles, and other delicacies which vary from shop to shop. These shops usually serve tea with milk in small glasses to their regulars. Occasionally a street vendor will sell sinizza, a deep-fried ball of fish, batter, and other ingredients. = Netherlands = In the Netherlands, the French fries are thinner and generally referred to as patat (the word for potato in the south of the Netherlands and in Flanders) or friet (from the French frire meaning deep- frying) or patat friet. Some shops in the Netherlands also sell Vlaamse friet (Flemish fries, similar to the type sold in Belgium) but this is less common than the thinner variant. In the Netherlands, French fries are traditionally fried in vegetable oil. herring and chopped onions In the Netherlands, street foods are usually sold by a small store which is a mix of a cafe/bar and a fast-food restaurant, known as a snackbar or cafetaria. These stores may also contain the typically Dutch vending machine, an automatiek. While patat friet forms the main portion of the foods sold, many other items are also on offer including different types of deep-fried snack meats such as kroketten and frikandellen, and cheese snacks such as the kaassouffle (cheese deep fried inside a crispy bread crumb crust). Often, the product range includes other foods such as hamburgers, ice cream, bread rolls with different fillings, and occasionally pizza, falafel, doner kebab and shoarma. Also sold may be deep- fried Vietnamese spring rolls and other originally Asian and/or Surinamese snacks like bapao (a baozi filled with minced meat) and barra (a deep-fried savoury doughnut). Street stalls also sell different fried, smoked and raw fish products, and are called a viskraam or haringkar (Dutch for \\"fish stall\\" or \\"herring cart)\\". Besides raw herring served with chopped onions sometimes with bread rolls and pickled cucumber, these stalls also sell fish products such as smoked mackerel, smoked eel and kibbeling (deep fried cod nuggets). At festivals, markets and especially on New Year's Eve, street stalls around the country sell a type of beignets called oliebollen (literally 'oil balls'). They may also sell other sweet pastries such as waffles and apple beignets. = Poland = A zapiekanka Obwarzanki salesman in Kraków Popular street snacks in Poland include zapiekanki, essentially Polish-style French-bread pizzas with a variety of toppings; the obwarzanki krakowskie of Kraków, which are like bagels (only with bigger holes); and precle (pretzels). The most common street food in Poland, seems to be lody, or ice cream. Long lines outside ice cream shops, and scores of pedestrians toting cones, are a regular fixture of Polish streetscapes. Many fast food shops offer waffles (gofry), topped with whipped cream, powdered sugar, fresh fruit, or fruit jelly. Some of them also serve rurki z kremem, pipes similar to ice-cream cones, filled with whipped cream. Hot dogs, hamburgers, and french fries are also very popular, often sold in the same shops and kiosks as zapiekanki. Pizza vendors commonly offer pizza in slices. Kebab (döner kebab in pita) vendors are also present and popular, as they are often open late in the night. =Romania= In Romania the most commonly available street foods during the day are covrigi, hot pretzels covered in sesame or poppy seeds, and plăcinte. \\"Plăcinte\\" can refer to sweet or savory pies with various fillings or to large pieces of fried dough eaten with garlic sauce, sour cream, cheese, or jam, similar to Hungarian lángos. In the south and along the Black Sea, plăcintă dobrogeană is available. This type of plăcintă is more like the burek encountered in other parts of the Balkans. Doughnuts called gogoși are also commonly available. At fairs and in the winter, kürtős kalács (tulnic in Romanian) with nuts or cinnamon is very popular. Mititei or mici, small grilled skinless sausages, are often available in the summer in marketplaces and at fairs. Other street foods include popcorn, steamed ears of corn, roasted chestnuts in winter, and ice cream in summer. = Russia = Traditional Eastern European items such as blini, pirozhki, vatrushki and sausages are widely available. Kvass, a small beer made (usually) from bread, with honey being a frequent additive (medoviy kvass), is sold cold out of tanks or barrels on the street. The cuisine of Russia's Turkic minorities is popular, with dishes like chebureki, shashlik, shawerma, tandoor bread, and plov (pilaf). In areas with Chinese immigrant populations, Chinese dishes are sold. Ice cream is enjoyed even on the coldest days. Pizza is also available. Kiosks sell candy, snacks, produce, beer and other beverages. = Slovakia = In Slovakia street offerings include steamed sweetcorn cobs, fried flat bread loaves with garlic and salt or other condiments (langos), fried buns with poppy seed, jam, or cream cheese filling (pirozky). Ice-cream is eaten in summer and roasted chestnuts in autumn. Ciganska pecienka (Roma-style roasted pork), roasted sausage and more are sold at Saturday markets. Crepes and fresh sandwiches are available. = Spain = The concept of eating in the street is very rooted in the Spanish culture, even though in the last few decades the law has forbidden the sale of food in the streets due to hygiene concerns. The most common way to eat is still inside a bar with friends (tapeo), however, in winter, roast chestnuts can be bought in the street, especially in the north, and during fiestas, churros are also sold. Additionally, the typical bocadillo is the most common snack all around Spain for school children and workers. Bocadillos can be filled with various foodstuffs typical of the province (anchovies, sweet peppers, tortilla de patatas, tuna, ham, meat, cheese, Empanada Gallega, etc.) and are very convenient as \\"food on the go\\". Some major cities will have vendors selling ice cream, nuts and snacks from kiosks. During summer in Málaga (and many small towns nearby), the fruit of the higo chumbo (a local cactus) is often sold. =Sweden= A very common street food in Sweden is hot dogs, and the traditional korvkiosk (\\"sausage kiosk\\") also often serve meatballs with mashed potatoes, brown sauce and lingonberry jam. Tunnbrödsrulle (\\"flatbread roll\\") is also often sold as street food. It is a soft flatbread normally filled with a sausage and mashed potato and sometimes with prawn salad, lettuce and onion. Hamburgers and kebab are also popular street food; occasionally (up north, or at festivals/events elsewhere) with moose or reindeer meat. = Switzerland = Street foods available in Switzerland are sandwich-like, either the typical grilled panini, but also pretzels, grilled chicken, hot dogs or the traditional Bratwurst served with a slice of bread and sometimes mustard. Sweet foods include ice cream and crêpes. Stalls will typically be motorized trucks, rather than smaller wheeled carts. =Ukraine= Kvass vendor in Kiev, Ukraine Common Ukrainian street foods include various kinds of stuffed buns and dumplings, such as perohy, pyrizhky and varenyky that are either boiled or fried and frequently served with a sour cream dill sauce. Fillings include mushrooms, onions, potatoes, ground meats and cabbage. Holubsti, cabbage rolls with rice or meat filling and a tomato sauce are also frequently serves, particularly around the holiday of Easter. Tatar influence can be found with shashliks being popular. Kvass is a slightly fermented beverage made from rye bread, yeast and water. Dried apples and plums are steeped in sugar water which is then sold as a beverage called uzvar, particularly during festivals and fairs. =United Kingdom= Converted or purpose-built vans sell kebabs, baked potato, hamburgers and chips, especially at night. Individual portable ovens capable of being wheeled by a single man serve baked potatoes along with fillings such as cheese or chili con carne. On the coast fresh seafood is often sold straight from the catch cooked in mobile kitchens. At fairs, stalls sell candy floss and doughnuts. In Lancashire, hot parched peas (black peas) are bought from stalls, especially in the colder months. During winter there are stalls selling hot chestnuts. British street foods include fish and chips, which are frequently sold in and eaten out of a paper package. The most common street food in the capital in earlier periods was jellied eels or pie and mash made from meat, which would be covered in the liquor from cooking the eels, although this tradition is no longer as common as in the early 20th century. Ice cream vans are considered one of the signs of summer, and they usually play well-known tunes such as \\"Greensleeves\\" or \\"Teddy Bears' Picnic\\" through a PA system. Street carts can be seen in some cities selling products such as roast nuts and hot dogs, especially in places frequented by tourists.  Eurasia  = Turkey = In 1502 Ottoman Turkey became the first country to legislate and regularize street food standards. In Turkey, street foods vary considerably from region to region.

Fishcakes are commonly eaten with saltbread, a thick, round bread; the sandwich is called a \\"bread-and-two\\" and can be found at most village shops throughout the island. = Canada = The first BeaverTails stand in Ottawa's Byward Market. While most major cities in Canada offer a variety of street food, regional \\"specialties\\" are notable. Poutine (french fries with gravy and cheese curds) is available virtually everywhere across the country with thousands of different flavours and combinations. Similarly, hot dog stands can be found across Canada, but are far more common in Ontario (often sold from mobile canteen trucks, usually referred to as \\"chip wagons\\") than in Vancouver or Victoria (where the \\"Mr. Tube Steak\\" franchise is notable). Originating in Montréal, the Steamé is a different type of sausage than the traditional hot dog found elsewhere, it is steamed. A more expensive version is called the toasté and is toasted. These types of sausage have spread across the country to some degree but they remain most popular in Montréal. Falafel and pizza slices are foreign dishes that are popular nationwide, to varying degrees in different cities. Shawarma is quite prevalent in Ottawa, while Halifax offers its own unique version of the Doner kebab called the Donair, which features a sauce, made from condensed milk, sugar, and vinegar. The donair has spread across the country in pizza chains and other fast food restaurants. Also originating in Halifax, and now having spread somewhat are garlic fingers, a pizza-like dish with baked dough, cheese, and garlic but no tomato sauce and a different crust. Ice cream trucks can be seen (and often heard) nationwide during the summer months.Corn on the Cob is found commonly as well, often grilled, particularly at country fairs. British influence is seen nationwide with the very popular fish and chips often sold at chip wagons. Crêpes are also found, with sweet or savoury fillings.

Yaniqueques (from Jonnycake) are essentially round flour shaped cakes which are fried and usually eaten with salt and/or ketchup. Other vendors sell plantain fritters and fried or boiled salami. Hamburgers are sold at stands called chimis, which also offer sandwiches called chimichurris, though these bear little to no resemblance to the Argentine sauce of the same name. Chimis occasionally also offer hot dogs and other sandwich varieties. Corn on the cob can be bought on the street, usually sold by traveling vendors who move around on a tricycle. Sweets vendors who sell treats such as candied coconut and dulce de leche sell their goods at major intersections in cities and sometimes have their own stand. Often, fruit vendors also prepare platters of chopped pineapple, mango, banana and/or papaya topped with honey or syrup. =Haiti= In Haiti street vendors sell dishes such as fried plantains, griot (deep-fried pork or beef), frescos (fruit soda drink), cassava bread, pig's ears, and Haitian patties (pastry filled with choice of chicken, fish, beef, or pork). =Jamaica= A plate of jerk chicken, with rice, plantains, carrots and green beans The most common Jamaican street food is jerk chicken or pork and can be found everywhere on the island.

These foods can be found on the side of just about any busy street, but also typically in kiosks, often near the beach. Sorullos a fried cornmeal batter shaped like fat fingers; they can be sweet or savory. Sorullos are stuffed with Puerto Rican white cheese, Cheddar or mozzarella and is served with Russian dressing. Sweet sorullos contain sugar and are filled with Puerto Rican white cheese and fruit paste such as goiabada. Arañitas get their name from their shape, a play on araña, or spider. These shredded green plantain fritters are mixed with mashed garlic, cilantro and fried. Cuchifrito is about as simple a dish. Essentially, slice off a chunk of pork (the ear, the stomach, or the tail), cover it in batter, and deep-fry. The almojábana is a fritter made flour from rice, baking soda, cheese (Creole, cheddar, or mozzarella), Parmesan cheese, milk and egg. This mixture is used to make a dough that is fried into a ball. This frying is done mostly in the Western region of the island where one could find on sale in stalls, cafés and festivities. =Trinidad and Tobago= In Trinidad and Tobago there are roti wrap and shark and bake stands that provide quick foods like roti, dhal puri, fried bake, and the most popular, Doubles. Roti is a thin flat bread originating from India that is fluffy on the inside and crispy and flaky on the outside. It is cooked on a flat iron plate called a tawah (Hindi tawa) or platain and served with curried chicken, pork or beef. Dahl puri is similar to the roti but is softer and pliable and has crushed dahl lentils cooked with saffron and placed in the centre of the dough before it is rolled out and cooked. This is also served with either curried chicken, pork or beef. Fried bake is made by frying flattened balls of dough that becomes fluffy and increases in height as it is fried. It can be served with fried ripe plantains, meat or gravy. At the shark & bake stands fried bakes filled with well-seasoned shark fillets and dressed with many different condiments including pepper, garlic and chadon beni can also be found. Doubles is made with two flat breads called baras (from Hindi bara, \\"big\\") that are filled with channa (from Hindi \\"chick peas\\") and topped with pepper, cucumber chutney, mango chutney, coconut chutney or bandania/chadon beni. It can be eaten either wrapped up as an easy to eat sandwich, or open it up and eat each bara separately. = United States = Street food vendor in New York City. Los Angeles serving a bacon-wrapped hot dog In the United States, hot dogs and their many variations (corn dogs, chili dogs) are perhaps the most common street food, particularly in major metropolitan areas such as New York City. Roasted nuts and gyros are often sold in the cities. Cheesesteaks, breakfast sandwiches, and soft-pretzels are common in Philadelphia. Throughout the US, ice cream is sold out of trucks. Tacos and Tortas are sold from open food stalls. Pizza and egg rolls are available from window counters. Some vendors operate out of food trucks and food carts, which offer a low overhead for entrepreneurs and often serve a huge variety of cuisines. Like restaurants, they are regulated and subject to inspections by local municipal or county health departments. Food trucks surged in popularity after the success of the Korean–Mexican fusion truck Kogi Korean BBQ in Los Angeles in 2009. According to Smithsonian Magazine, the hip new generation of food trucks \\"are the new incubators of culinary innovation,\\" with Kogi serving novel concoctions such as kimchi quesadillas, and gourmet ice cream truck Coolhaus serving inventive flavors such as Avocado Sriracha, Brown Butter Candied Bacon, and Fried Chicken & Waffles. Diversity and the lack of a strictly defined national cuisine means that, in most urban areas in the US and Canada, vendors sell hot dogs, pizza, falafel, gyros, kebobs, tortilla-based snacks such as tacos and burritos, panini, crêpes, french fries, egg rolls, and other various dishes. =Virgin Islands= Popular street foods in the Virgin Islands include patés, fried fish, fried chicken leg and johnnycake (fried dough). Pates, similar to the empanadas of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, consist of fried flour filled with various meats, including conch, saltfish, beef, chicken and lobster. Oceania An ice cream van at Batemans Bay, New South Wales, Australia =Australia= The most common street food in Australia is the sausage sizzle, usually consisting of a thin sausage or sandwich steak cooked on a barbecue and served on a slice of bread with optional fried onions, cheese, mustard and tomato or barbecue sauce. The stalls are usually run by local sporting or charity groups as fundraiser. Some parts of Adelaide with higher percentages of Greek and Lebanese residents prefer to serve sausage sizzle wrapped in pita rather than on a slice of bread. A pie floater is a meal served at pie carts in Adelaide and elsewhere in South Australia. It was once more widely available in other parts of Australia, but its popularity waned. It consists of an Australian meat pie covered with tomato sauce, sitting in a plate of green pea soup. People can buy soft serve and other ice creams from vans which drive around the streets. The vans alert potential customers with a tinkling tune, for example \\"Greensleeves\\" or \\"The Entertainer\\". In Melbourne and Sydney, kebabs and souvlakis have taken over as the main street food due to the high percentage of Greek and Lebanese people in both cities, and is popular as a late night snack, especially after a few beers. They are known to curb late night drunken violence as punters gather around and enjoy a meal together and share stories of their night. In Adelaide, this food is called \\"yiros\\" and is more commonly sold as takeaway rather than as street food. Banh mi, sometimes advertised as \\"Vietnamese pork roll\\" have recently become more popular as street food in Australia. Cold rolls and sushis are also commonly available a take-away finger food. = New Zealand = Vans selling burgers, New Zealand hotdogs (a battered sausage on a stick), toasted sandwiches and chips are the most common type of street food in New Zealand. The White Lady food van in downtown Auckland is a well-known icon of the city. Many coffee carts and coffee vans operate on the streets, both independent ones as well as vans operating as part of a franchise system such as The Coffee Guy. Like Australia, ice cream vans and sausage sizzles are also common in New Zealand. The most well known ice cream franchise is Mr Whippy, a franchise that originally came from England, and also operates in Australia. Mr Whippy soft-serve ice cream is an iconic symbol of a New Zealand summer to many Kiwis.  South America  =Argentina= In Argentina, vendors sell choripan, a barbequeued sausage served wrapped in French bread, or morcipan, using a blood sausage (morcilla) instead. Pizza is very popular, in part due to the country's heavy Italian immigration in the early 20th century. Local versions include the fugazzeta, a pizza made with mozzarella cheese and onions, and the fainá: a pizza made with garbanzo bean flour with no toppings, generally served as a side dish to regular pizza. The empanada, which in gourmet versions is baked, is usually deep-fried in this case. Empanadas can be made with beef, fish, ham & cheese, neapolitan (using the same toppings as that pizza) or vegetarian. Sandwiches are usually served hot, like the tostado or the lomito, the latter having a great number of versions, with food courts offering all kinds of ingredients and combinations. Other local street food includes local versions of the hotdog called pancho, and the hamburger or hamburguesa. Despite being very popular in the past, these have been displaced by a number of reasons, mainly a local perception that American-style foods are unhealthy and of low quality. Sweets and desserts usually found in Argentine streets include caramel apple (manzana acaramelada), cotton candy (algodon de azucar), sweet popcorn (pochoclo) and a local snack called garrapiñada, which is made of peanuts, vanilla and sugar caramel, and sold in small bags in the shape of tubes. =Brazil= Cheese buns Pão de queijo (lit. \\"cheese bread\\") is a street snack in the southeast of Brazil and, increasingly, the rest of the country. Hot dogs, containing one or more sausages cooked in a tomato-based sauce with bell peppers and onions, are often sold with many toppings, including but not limited to: grated cheese, catupiry, ketchup, mayonnaise, green peas, onions, corn kernels, tomatoes, bacon, shredded chicken, , potato salad and mashed potatoes. Hamburgers are also offered with an assortment of toppings, such as mozzarella cheese, bacon, fried eggs, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, ketchup and mustard, the popular \\"X-Tudo\\" (or cheese-all, a souped up cheeseburger). Sandwiches of calabresa sausage, which is similar in taste to pepperoni, are also popular. All over the country, popcorn is offered in push carts, both savory or sweet (with sugar and cocoa powder). Churros push carts (sausage shaped deep fried dough filled with a choice of doce-de-leite caramel or chocolate sauce) are also found on any major city street. Hot dogs with a topping of shoestring fries and catupiry being torched in Paraguaçu Paulista In the northeastern state of Bahia, the region's African heritage is reflected in the iconic acarajé (deep fried black eyed pea bun filled with caruru, made from salted dried shrimp, and vatapá, a creamy combination of coconut milk, palm oil and cashew nuts) and sweets such as cocada (candied coconut) and pé-de-moleque (peanut brittle). Biscoito Globo and Matte Leão, at Copacabana beach Rio de Janeiro beach vendors sell Mate Gelado (erva mate iced-tea), biscoitos de polvilho (sour manioc flour puffs), empadas or empadinhas (a smaller version of a chicken pie, but with fillings ranging from chicken, cheese, shrimp and such), roasted peanuts and queijo coalho (grilled cheese on sticks, barbecued on the spot), as well as popsicles (and the sacolé variant), cold beer, esfirras and home-made sandwiches (sanduíche natural). Due to health concerns, the city of Rio de Janeiro prohibited in 2009 the sale of many beloved foods such as queijo coalho, shrimp skewers, caipirinha and churrasco. It was argued that the careless disposal of charcoal on beaches would often harm children and the elderly, and that the uncertain precedence of certain items could impose a health risk. Beach vendors, however, have not refrained from selling those items. Other cities have since followed the lead, and have also banned the usage of grills for beach vendors. =Chile= In Chile, the street cart menus tend to include: sopaipillas (a deep fried dough made out of flour and pumpkin), Anticucho (a type of kebab), completo (local version of hot dog, usually topped with mayonnaise, chopped tomatoes and sauerkraut), calzones rotos (sweet deep-fried dough with pulverized sugar sprinkled on top), fresh fruit juices (preferently orange or grapefruit), fruit salads, soft drinks, French fries, pizza, churros, empanadas (ether fried ones filled with cheese or baked ones filled with minced meat, black olives and hard-boiled eggs), savory or caramelized peanuts, local sweets and others. =Colombia= Carimañolas, empanadas, arepas and egg filled arepas In Colombia, the empanada, a deep-fried meat-filled patty, is sold. It is also a very popular side dish. Various types of arepa are also a common street food. Also popular is the chuzo (meat skewer), consisting of pork or chicken speared shish-kebab style on a thin wooden stake (hence the name chuzo, from chuzar meaning \\"to pierce or spear\\") and cooked over charcoal on a pushcart. Most chuzos are garnished with a small arepa at the top and a small roasted potato at the bottom. Morcilla, various sausages, chicharrón and chinchurria are also sold by street vendors. A very common street treat is corn on the cob (mazorca) cooked over charcoal and buttered. Lechona (roasted pig stuffed with yellow peas, green onion, yellow rice, and spices cooked in an outdoor brick oven for about ten hours) is sold in the vicinity of many marketplaces. Mango Biche is green mango cut in slices or strings with salt, lime juice and/or adobo (spice mix). Buñuelos and natilla are popular especially during the Christmas season. In the Paisa Region, pan de bono, pan de yuca, pan de queso, pastries and wine cake are sold at street stalls. Ice cream treats and paletas are also popular at street vendors. Fruit salad with condensed milk, granizado shakes, salpicon, and fresh fruit are also sold in the land of \\"eternal spring\\". Carimañolas, butifarra (Butifarra Soledeñas), arepas de huevo (Deep-fried egg filled arepa) and cocadas are sold in coastal regions. Also Almojábana, pastel de yuca (deep-fried rice and meat filled cassava patty) are commonly sold on the streets of Bogotá. =Peru= In Peru, anticuchos, a type of kebab, are often sold by street vendors called anticucheras. Also, cuy, a species of Guinea pig, is served as a delicacy on religious holidays. =Venezuela= In Venezuela, the arepa is a common fast-food meal. It consists of a flattened cornmeal bun, about the size and shape of an English muffin, split open and usually stuffed with soft cheese. Other fillings include shredded chicken salad with mayonnaise and avocado (reina pepiada), shredded brisket cooked with onions, red bell peppers and tomatoes (carne mechada) and pickled octopus. Also popular are cachapas, flat cakes made from fresh corn, rather than corn flour. Empanadas are also eaten in Venezuela, and are made out of corn flour, rather than wheat flour, as in the rest of the continent. They are filled with the same ingredients as arepas.

If k is a field, a commutative k-algebroid is a cogroupoid object in the category of k-algebras; the category of such is hence dual to the category of groupoid k-schemes. This commutative version has been used in 1970-s in algebraic geometry and stable homotopy theory. The generalization of Hopf algebroids and its main part of the structure, associative bialgebroids, to the noncommutative base algebra was introduced by J.-H. Lu in 1996 as a result on work on groupoids in Poisson geometry (later shown equivalent in nontrivial way to a construction of Takeuchi from the 1970s and another by Xu around the year 2000). They may be loosely thought of as Hopf algebras over a noncommutative base ring, where weak Hopf algebras become Hopf algebras over a separable algebra. It is a theorem that a Hopf algebroid satisfying a finite projectivity condition over a separable algebra is a weak Hopf algebra, and conversely a weak Hopf algebra H is a Hopf algebroid over its separable subalgebra HL. The antipode axioms have been changed by G. Böhm and K. Szlachányi (J. Algebra) in 2004 for tensor categorical reasons and to accommodate examples associated to depth two Frobenius algebra extensions. Definition A left Hopf algebroid (H, R) is a left bialgebroid together with an antipode: the bialgebroid (H, R) consists of a total algebra H and a base algebra R and two mappings, an algebra homomorphism s: R → H called a source map, an algebra anti-homomorphism t: R → H called a target map, such that the commutativity condition s(r1) t(r2) = t(r2) s(r1) is satisfied for all r1, r2 ∈ R. The axioms resemble those of a Hopf algebra but are complicated by the possibility that R is a non- commutative algebra or its images under s and t are not in the center of H. In particular a left bialgebroid (H, R) has an R-R-bimodule structure on H which prefers the left side as follows: r1 ⋅ h ⋅ r2 = s(r1) t(r2) h for all h in H, r1, r2 ∈ R. There is a coproduct Δ: H → H ⊗R H and counit ε: H → R that make (H, R, Δ, ε) an R-coring (with axioms like that of a coalgebra such that all mappings are R-R-bimodule homomorphisms and all tensors over R). Additionally the bialgebroid (H, R) must satisfy Δ(ab) = Δ(a)Δ(b) for all a, b in H, and a condition to make sure this last condition makes sense: every image point Δ(a) satisfies a(1) t(r) ⊗ a(2) = a(1) ⊗ a(2) s(r) for all r in R. Also Δ(1) = 1 ⊗ 1. The counit is required to satisfy ε(1H) = 1R and the condition ε(ab) = ε(as(ε(b))) = ε(at(ε(b))). The antipode S: H → H is usually taken to be an algebra anti-automorphism satisfying conditions of exchanging the source and target maps and satisfying two axioms like Hopf algebra antipode axioms; see the references in Lu or in Böhm-Szlachányi for a more example-category friendly, though somewhat more complicated, set of axioms for the antipode S. The latter set of axioms depend on the axioms of a right bialgebroid as well, which are a straightforward switching of left to right, s with t, of the axioms for a left bialgebroid given above. Examples As an example of left bialgebroid, take R to be any algebra over a field k. Let H be its algebra of linear self-mappings. Let s(r) be left multiplication by r on R; let t(r) be right multiplication by r on R. H is a left bialgebroid over R, which may be seen as follows. From the fact that H ⊗R H ≅ Homk(R ⊗ R, R) one may define a coproduct by Δ(f)(r ⊗ u) = f(ru) for each linear transformation f from R to itself and all r, u in R. Coassociativity of the coproduct follows from associativity of the product on R. A counit is given by ε(f) = f(1). The counit axioms of a coring follow from the identity element condition on multiplication in R. The reader will be amused, or at least edified, to check that (H, R) is a left bialgebroid. In case R is an Azumaya algebra, in which case H is isomorphic to R ⊗ R, an antipode comes from transposing tensors, which makes H a Hopf algebroid over R. Another class of examples comes from letting R be the ground field; in this case, the Hopf algebroid (H, R) is a Hopf algebra.

There is around 340,000 to 500,000 people of Lebanese ancestry. Migration history Lebanese immigration to Venezuela started when the first wave began to arrive to the country during 1862, in the last months of the Federal War. Once disembarked in the ports of Venezuela, they were classified by the authorities as Turks, because they had only been issued passports with that nationality. According to research, 2 the entry points were Margarita Island and Puerto Cabello. The first contingent of Lebanese settled in these ports and also in Cumaná, La Guaira and Punto Fijo, from where they spread to the interior of the country. They worked mainly in the commercial sector, helping to develop this sector in the national economy that until the moment presented little progress. The second wave of Lebanese immigration developed after 1918. Next to the defeat of the Ottoman Empire after World War I, the French Mandate of Syria was established, with one of its subdivisions being the State of Greater Lebanon. The harsh conditions of the postwar period once again motivated the Lebanese to embark on a path similar to that of the 19th century towards the American continent, including Venezuela. Despite the fact that the Lebanese had arrived in Venezuela on several occasions, it was not until the mid-1960s and early 1970s that immigration became more forceful, since at that time Venezuela had many employment opportunities and of good living. The Lebanese were able to maintain their traditions and their identity already in Venezuelan territory, which they prioritize in relation to the education of young people in their community. Religion In religion, the majority of Lebanese-Venezuelans are Christians who belong to the Maronite Catholic Church, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Melkite Catholic. A scant number are Muslims.

His parents were Count Gyula Szapáry de Szapár, Muraszombat et Széchy-Sziget and Countess Adél Etelka Hadik de Futak. One of his great-grandfathers was Gyula Szapáry, the Prime Minister of Hungary between 1890 and 1892. After the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 he emigrated to Austria then Belgium. He holds a master's degree and a doctorate in economics from the Catholic University of Leuven. His academic opponent was Sándor Lámfalussy. Career Between 1965 and 1966, he worked for the European Economic Community (EEC). Between December 1966 and April 1990, he worked at the International Monetary Fund in Washington, D.C., most recently as assistant director. Returning home and granting Hungarian citizenship in 1990, Szapáry was senior resident representative of the International Monetary Fund in Hungary (1990–1993). Then he served as deputy governor of the Hungarian National Bank and thus a member of the Monetary Council on two occasions (1993–1999 then 2001–2007), under governors Péter Ákos Bod, György Surányi and Zsigmond Járai, as well as senior advisor to György Surányi, the Governor of the Hungarian National Bank (1999–2001). Other positions include alternate governor for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (1994–1995); president of the Board of Directors for the International Training Centre for Bankers in Budapest (1993–2001); board member of the Budapest Commodity Exchange (1997–2001); president of the Foundation for Enterprise Promotion for the Hungarian province of Jász-Nagykun-Szolnok (1995–99); member of the Economic and Financial Committee of the European Commission and of the European Central Bank’s International Relations Committee (2004–07); and member of the Hungarian Economic Social Council (2004–07).

He has been a member of the Euro50 Group since 2001. From July 2010 to January 2011, he was chief economic policy advisor to Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. He was appointed Hungarian Ambassador to the United States of America in early 2011. He replaced Béla Szombati in this position. Due to his appointment, the Second Orbán Government changed the law on the appointment of ambassadors by abolishing the age limit of 70 years. Szapáry was 72-year-old when Prime Minister Viktor Orbán invited him to fill the position. As a result, critics called the law as \\"lex Szapáry\\". He served in that capacity until January 2015, when he was replaced by Réka Szemerkényi. Currently he is Chief Adviser to the Governor of the Hungarian National Bank and honorary professor at Corvinus University of Budapest. György Szapáry is Doctor honoris causa of the University of Miskolc, Hungary; the recipient of the Sándor Popovics Award in recognition for outstanding contribution in the field of banking and monetary policy; a recipient of the OTP Bank's András Fay award; and a recipient of the insignia of the French Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur.

The parish includes the hamlet of Westcot about west of the village. Sparsholt was part of Berkshire until the 1974 boundary changes transferred the Vale of White Horse to Oxfordshire. Geography Sparsholt village is a spring line settlement at the foot of the Berkshire Downs escarpment. The parish measures more than miles north – south but less than east – west. It is bounded to the north by Stutfield Brook, a tributary of the River Ock. On other sides it is bounded by field boundaries. In 1924 the parish's area was . The highest point in the parish is Sparsholt Down, a chalk hill south of the village, whose summit is above sea level. Toponymy The earliest known record of the place-name is as Speresholte or Speresholt in an Anglo-Saxon charter from AD 963 now reproduced in the Cartularium Saxonicum. The Domesday Book of 1086 records it as Spersolt and a pipe roll from 1156 records it as Speresholt. It is derived from Old English and probably means \\"wood where spear-shafts were obtained\\". Manor The Domesday Book records that Sparsholt was a large manor of 16 hides. It was a royal manor from the Norman conquest of England until the reign of KingHenry I, who granted it with the manor of Aldermaston to Robert Achard for one knight's fee. Sparsholt remained with Aldermaston until 1622, when Sir Humphrey Forster sold it to Elizabeth, Lady Craven. She left it to her son William Craven, 1st Earl of Craven, who in 1660 conveyed it to his cousin Anthony Craven, who was made a baronet in 1661. It then passed to Anthony Craven's descendants in the Palmer, Richmond and Gabbit families until 1807, when it was sold to a Rev. John Hippisley. The Hippisley family still held the manor in 1924. Parish church Inside Holy Cross parish church The oldest part of the Church of England parish church of Holy Cross is the nave, which was built in the 12th century. The church has a 13th-century west tower, and 13th-century arches leading to the chancel and south transept. In the 14th century the chancel and transept were rebuilt and several new windows were inserted. The chancel was given a Decorated Gothic piscina and triple sedilia with ornate cusped arches. A pair of tomb recesses in a similar style was installed, one on the south side of the chancel beside the sedilia and the other on the north side. In the transept are three rare 14th-century oak effigies, two of them under canopies like those in the chancel. Some 13th- and 14th-century stained glass survives in the church. Monument to John and Bridget Playdell in Holy Rood church Late in the 15th century a vestry was added on the north side of the chancel, more windows were inserted in the nave and the nave roof was replaced. On the north wall in the nave is a large Renaissance monument with strapwork flanked by Doric columns. It commemorates John Playdell who died in 1591 and his wife Bridget who died in 1623. In the south transept is a smaller Renaissance monument with strapwork flanked by Ionic columns. It commemorates Sir George Hyde KG of Kingston Lisle who also died in 1623. The chancel has a 17th-century collar truss roof. The north porch is late 18th-century, as probably is the transept roof. In the 19th century a Gothic Revival traceried wooden screen was inserted in the chancel arch. The church is a grade I listed building. The west tower has a ring of four bells. Joseph Carter of Reading cast the treble and third bells in 1578 and the tenor bell in 1603. Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast or re-cast the second bell in 1914. Holy Cross parish is part of the Ridgeway Benefice, along with the parishes of Childrey, Kingston Lisle, Letcombe Bassett, Letcombe Regis and West Challow. Griffin Memorial Hall (right) and adjoining cottages (centre and left) School and village hall A small annual income to run a parish sunday school was established by private donations in the 18th century. In 1874 a school and adjoining cottages were built at the junction of Sparsholt Street and Church Way. In 1964 the school was closed and in 1968 the building was bought for conversion into a village hall. The hall was modernised in 2007. Canal Between 1805 and 1807 the section of the Wilts & Berks Canal between Longcot and Challow was completed. It passes through the parish less than north of the village. Traffic on the canal had all but ceased by 1901 and the route was formally abandoned in 1914. The Wilts & Berks Canal Trust is currently restoring the canal.

1999 Latakia incident)George, Alan. Syria: neither bread nor freedom. 2003. p.115. were violent protests and armed clashes, which erupted in Latakia, Syria following 1998 People's Assembly's Elections. The violent events were an explosion of a long-running feud between Hafez al-Assad and his younger brother Rifaat. Two people were killed in fire exchanges of Syrian police and Rifaat's supporters during police crack-down on Rifaat's port compound in Latakia. According to opposition sources, denied by the government, the protests left hundreds of dead or injured.Taylor & Francis Group. Europea World Year Book 2004. Europa Publications, 2004. Volume 2, p.4056 Background =Attempted 1984 coup d'etat= When Hafez al-Assad suffered from heart problems in 1983, he established a six-member committee to run the country. Rifaat was not included, whereas the council consisted entirely of Sunni Muslim loyalists close to Hafez. This caused unease in the Alawi-dominated officer corps, and several high-ranking officers began rallying around Rifaat, while others remained loyal to Hafez's instructions. Rifaat's troops, then numbering more than 55,000 with tanks, artillery, aircraft and helicopters, began asserting control over Damascus, with a clear attempt to succeed his brother. Tensions between forces loyal to Hafez and those loyal to Rifaat were extreme, but by early 1984, Hafez had recovered and assumed full control, at which point most officers rallied around him. In what at first seemed a compromise, Rifaat was made vice-president with responsibility for security affairs, but this proved a wholly nominal post. Rifaat was then sent abroad on \\"an open-ended working visit.\\" Both his closest supporters and others who had failed to prove their loyalty to Hafez were purged from the army and Ba'ath Party in the years that followed. Rifaat was, thereafter, confined to exile in France and Spain. He nominally retained the post of vice president until 1998, when he was stripped even of the title. He had retained a large business empire both in Syria and abroad, partly through his son Sumer. =1998 People's Assembly elections= Elections to the People's Assembly in Syria were held on 30 November and 1 December 1998, at which the NPF, led by the ruling Ba'ath party, won the majority of seats. On 11 February 1999, a national referendum verified the Assembly's decision to nominate President Assad for a fifth term in office. It was also speculated that Bashar al-Assad to be promoted to vice-presidency, after already acquiring colonel army rank in January that year. In June, Syrian authorities undertook a campaign by Bashar to counter corruption in public office, which resulted in several officials and businessmen detained. In October, after a nine-month trial, former Syrian intelligence service director got a lengthy prison sentence for alleged corruption and embezzlement of public funds. Protests In September, large scale arrests by security forces of some 1,000 people in Damascus and Latakia aimed on supporters and relatives of Rifaat al-Assad. In October, subsequent closures of Rifaat's interests provoked several days of violent clushes between Rifaat's supporters and security forces. The official version was that Rifaat had ignored a series of decrees from the Syrian Transport Ministry, ordering a demolition of his 'jetty' and an accompanying complex that had been established on 11,410 sq. meters of public land. When the police were sent to enforce the closure of the compound, they encountered small-arms fire and retreated. The security forces then attacked and occupied the port, resulting in two people killed. Opposition reports of those events, rejected by the Syrian Government, indicated that hundreds of people were killed of injured. After the events, the Information Minister, Muhammad Salman, warned that if Rifaat returns to Syria he would face criminal charges. It was never explained why the 'illegal' port of Rifaat had been tolerated for four years (1995–1999), before the crack-down. The 1999 crackdown in Lattakia destroyed much of Rifaat's remaining business network in Syria; large numbers of Rifaat's supporters were arrested. This was seen as tied to the issue of succession, with Rifaat having begun to position himself to succeed the ailing Hafez, who in his turn sought to eliminate all potential competition for his designated successor, his son Bashar al-Assad. Rifaat's reaction to Bashar's presidency succession In France, Rifaat loudly protested the succession of Bashar al-Assad to the post of president, claiming that he himself embodies the \\"only constitutional legality\\" (as vice president, alleging his dismissal was unconstitutional). He made threatening remarks about planning to return to Syria at a time of his choosing to assume \\"his responsibilities and fulfill the will of the people.\\" He also exclaimed that he will rule benevolently and democratically, which he will do so with \\"the power of the people and the army\\" behind him.

The school has approximately 850 pupils on roll and around 100 teaching and non teaching staff. The school specialises in Mathematics and the Performing Arts. Blessed Hugh Faringdon is one of the many Catholic schools in and around Reading but the only secondary and is under the Trusteeship of the Diocese of Portsmouth. The school is a member of the Partners in Excellence group of schools. History Blessed Hugh Faringdon was founded in the 1958 by and for the Catholic Community in Reading. £200,000 was raised by the Catholic Community to purchase the land and build the school. The efforts were led by Archbishop John Henry King who encouraged the parishes of Reading to raise money through subscriptions, garden fetes, bazaars and bank loans. The school was named after Hugh Faringdon, who was a member of the Order of Saint Benedict and was elected abbot of Reading Abbey in 1520. He frequently entertained King Henry VIII at the abbey, but in 1539, at the time of the dissolution of the monasteries, he was indicted for high treason and was executed opposite the present St James's Church. He was declared a martyr and beatified by Pope Leo XIII in 1895. The school opened in 1958 to 60 pupils and the first Governing Body consisted of 9 people including Canon Murphy, and Fathers Kirk, Collins, O'Malley and Donnelly. The first of the school's Headteachers was appointed, Mr MP Healy, and he stayed for 18 years. The school celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2008. The current Headteacher is Dr Simon Uttley, who has led the school since Easter 2017. In 2013 72% of pupils achieved 5 A*-C GCSE grades including English and Maths, and 100% of pupils achieved 5 A*-C grades. Its Value Added figure for this was 1,043.3, against a national average of 1,000. This placed the school in the top 2% of schools in England using the Raiseonline measure. In November 2013 the Sunday Times published its list of the top 500 state schools and BHF was placed at number 472, placing it in the top 10% of schools in England. The school was reinspected by Ofsted in 2017 where it was again judged to be \\"Good\\" with behaviour described as \\"typically superb\\". The following year the school secured a judgement of 'Outstanding' from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Portsmouth. The school holds the International Schools award, the UNICEF Rights Respecting Foundation Award and is part of the iCan charity Secondary Talks programme. In 2019 the school opened a £1.9m facility for students on the ASD spectrum. In 2020 the school increased its year on year admissions number from 150 to 180 to meet increasing demand.

It took place in the port of Saigon in the early hours of May 2, 1964, and was mounted by commandos from the 65th Special Operations Group (). Card was first commissioned into the United States Navy during World War II. Decommissioned in 1946, Card was reactivated in 1958 and entered service with the Military Sea Transport Service, transporting military equipment to South Vietnam as part of the United States military commitment to that country. As a regular visitor to the port, Card became a target for local VC commando units. Shortly after midnight on May 2, 1964, two Viet Cong commandos climbed out of the sewer tunnel near the area where Card was anchored, and they attached two loads of explosives to the ship's hull. The attack was a success and Card sank , and five civilian crew members were killed by the explosions. The ship was refloated 17 days later, and was towed to the Philippines for repairs. Background USNS Card was a that had served in the United States Navy. In 1946 Card was decommissioned and was transferred to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. On May 16, 1958, Card re-entered service with the Military Sea Transport Service, under the control of the United States Navy. The ship was manned by a civilian crew and was prefixed \\"USNS\\" (United States Naval Ship) instead of \\"USS\\" (United States Ship) as it was in service but not commissioned.Grey, p. 146 With the escalation of the Vietnam War, the United States government stepped up military support for South Vietnam's fight against the Viet Cong. On December 15, 1961, USNS Card left Quonset Point, Rhode Island, with a cargo of H-21 Shawnee helicopters and U.S. soldiers from Fort Devens, Massachusetts, bound for Vietnam. At Subic Bay in the Philippines, the cargo and troops were transferred to , which arrived and unloaded off the coast of Da Nang the following month. BATTALION HISTORY, 93rd Trans / 121st AHC, Early History, Web January 4, 2013. Card while in service with the United States Navy From 1961 onwards, Card and USNS Core regularly docked in Saigon to unload heavy artillery, M113 armored personnel carriers, aircraft, helicopters and ammunition for the South Vietnamese government. The Port of Saigon was situated between the Te and Ben Nghe Canals, and was about wide from one side to the other.Ho, p. 11 To facilitate the arrival of Card and other American ships which pulled into Saigon, the South Vietnamese military often deployed navy vessels to conduct patrols around the port, while the surrounding shores were protected by an elite Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) Airborne battalion. The port itself was guarded round the clock by Republic of Vietnam National Police, as undercover South Vietnamese agents operated across the river in the Thu Thiem area to disrupt VC activities there. Undeterred by the level of protection which the South Vietnamese government normally afforded to American ships, Tran Hai Phung—commander of the Viet Cong's Saigon-Gia Dinh Military District—ordered the 65th Special Operations Group to attack USNS Card. Sinking of USNS Card =Failed attempt on USNS Core= Despite their best efforts to control VC activities across the river in the Thu Thiem area, the South Vietnamese military and police could not stop VC agents from operating there. So VC members of the 65th Special Operations Group were able to watch US and South Vietnamese military activities at the port, while they were preparing to attack American targets. Lam Son Nao, a commando of the 65th Special Operations Group, was also an employee at the port facility. As his unit was assigned with the mission to attack the carrier, Nao took advantage of his position as an employee at the port facility, to reconnoitre Card to design the best strategy to sabotage the ship and all the military hardware on board. Nao's father had previously worked at the port facility as a tradesman, so he memorized all the tunnels and sewage systems at the facility. He advised Nao that the best way to enter the area where American ships normally anchored was through the sewer tunnel opposite Thu Thiem. While bathing in the Saigon River, Nao inspected the sewer tunnel, which his father had advised him to use. Nao concluded that the tunnel would provide the best access to the American area, but it also presented challenges. The sewage tunnel contained waste and toxic oils which could cause blindness, so Nao and his men would have to close their eyes as they moved through it to avoid blindness.Ho, p. 12 Nao and his men must bathe to purge deadly odours to avoid detection, and probably arrest, by South Vietnamese authorities. After Nao had surveyed the tunnels leading to the port, he presented his plan to the Saigon-Gia Dinh Military District Headquarters. Nao decided to utilise high explosives, enough to sink a ship, and to detonate them using a timer so that his men could get away safely. Nao's superiors approved the plan and they ordered him to launch the attack before sunrise to avoid killing local Vietnamese civilians. Nao returned to Saigon and began assembling the equipment required for the attack, which included C4 plastic explosives, TNT, wire, mine detonators and batteries. Nao trained new commandos, namely Nguyen Phu Hung and Nguyen Van Cay, to support his operation. To ensure success, Nao measured the height, length and width of the sewer tunnel to assemble the bomb devices to the right size, to be carried through the tunnel unhindered. Towards the end of 1963, Nao received news that Card had arrived in Saigon with another load of armored personnel carriers, artillery and aircraft. But the carrier turned out to be her sister ship, USNS Core. On the evening of December 29, 1963, Nao and Cay carried their bomb devices, which had about of explosives, through the sewer tunnel. They attached the explosives to Cores hull, set the timer and retreated into the sewer to await the outcome. The bombs failed to explode because the battery had expired due to protracted storage. Determined the operation would remain a secret, the commandos snuck back to Core and retrieved the explosive devices. Soon, Core and its crew sailed from Saigon without any damage. Nao reported the mission failure to the Saigon-Gia Dinh Military District Headquarters. His superiors did not express disappointment in the failure, but they encouraged Nao and his men to destroy Card at all costs. On May 1, 1964, Viet Cong reconnaissance teams spotted USNS Card as she sailed through Ganh Rai Bay and entered Long Tau River. They reported this information to the 65th Special Operations Group in Saigon.Ho, p. 13 As usual, Card docked at the commercial port to unload a shipment of cargo and military helicopters, and pick up helicopters to be returned to the US.Bartholomew & Milwee, p. 247 =Successful attack= When Nao received news Card had arrived in Saigon, he inspected the equipment which included a new battery and a redesigned bomb. Nao decided to set off the bombs during the early hours of May 2, so that he and his fellow operative could escape safely and avoid inflicting casualties on the local population. Due to illness, Cay declined to take part in the operation, so Hung had to replace him. At around 9am on May 1, Nao rushed to Hung's home, where the latter was given a hand grenade and was notified of an upcoming operation without much detail. At 6pm, after Nao had finished loading the bombs onto one canoe, he and Hung traveled down the Saigon River in two separate canoes, toward the commercial port district. They pulled over in the Thu Thiem area. To avoid detection by South Vietnamese authorities they mingled with the local workers. While awaiting the right time, Nao briefed Hung on the objectives of the operation, which was to sink the largest American ship at the Saigon Port, and report the results to headquarters. Shortly after 6:30pm as both men headed toward Warehouse Number 0 at the commercial port, a police patrol boat spotted them and gave chase. Nao ordered Hung to throw the hand grenade and both men would retreat toward the local village if their bombs were discovered by police. The police patrol stopped about away from Nao's canoe, and the patrol boat commander questioned both men about their activities during that evening.Ho, p. 14 Nao claimed that he and Hung intended to go to the other side of the river to buy new clothes at the market. To avoid delaying the operation, Nao bribed the patrol boat commander 1000 Vietnamese dong, as the South Vietnamese police were widely known for their corruption. When the patrol boat commander received the bribe, he gave both Nao and Hung permission to move on but demanded another bribe when they return. When the commandos arrived at the sewer tunnel, they assembled the bomb device with each man carrying of explosives through the tunnel. When the commandos emerged from the tunnel, they swam toward the broadside of Card which anchored near the sewer opening. Nao and Hung attached two bombs to the ship, with one near the bilge and one at the engine compartment, just above the waterline. Nao then inspected both bombs to ensure proper assembly.Ho, p. 15 Nao then stuck the battery onto a pole and connected it to the bombs with wires, then set the timer. At 1.10am, the bombs were completed and both commandos retreated to the sewer tunnel, boarded their canoes on the other side and rowed back to Thu Thiem. Again, the police patrol boat was waiting for Nao and Hung to arrive, because the commander wanted another bribe. As Nao and Hung approached the patrol boat, an explosion was heard and a bright light could be seen in the commercial port area. The South Vietnamese police patrol boat then started its engine and raced towards Card, instead of extracting another bribe. Aftermath For the VC commandos of the 65th Special Operations Group, the explosion on Card signalled a successful mission. By sunrise, Card had settled into the river with its engine compartment completely flooded. Five American civilians who worked on the ship died as a result of the attack.Bowman, p. 37 Due to rapid response from the ship's crew and local authorities, flooding inside the ship was quickly stopped and it was stabilized. An inspection revealed that the explosion had torn a hole long and high, on the starboard side of the ship.Bartholomew & Milwee, p. 248 In the days that followed, five US Navy divers were deployed to Saigon from the Philippines, in addition to several salvage teams from US bases in Japan and the Military Sea Transport Service Command. Amongst the divers was founding US Navy Seals member Roy Boehm, who claimed to have recovered the remains of a Hagerson Demolition Pack, a specialised explosive charge used by US navy frogmen. Bohem speculated that the explosives used in the attack had been stolen from his own South Vietnamese Navy unit by a group of deserters who had been mistreated by a South Vietnamese officer.First Seal by Roy Boehm and Charles Sasser pp. 294–296 , a rescue and salvage ship, bound for the Philippines, was ordered to change course and sail for Saigon. The tugboat based at Subic Bay in the Philippines was placed on standby, and later received orders to sail to South Vietnam. Upon arrival in Saigon, US Navy divers and salvage teams tried to pump water from Cards flooded compartments. Their initial attempts were hindered by malfunctions in the pumping equipment, and poor diving conditions in the river. It took salvors 17 days to refloat Card. They then began the process of moving the ship by installing a 6-inch pump and generators in Card to pump bilge water. Reclaimer and Tawakoni then towed Card to Subic Bay where it underwent further repairs.Bartholomew & Milwee, p. 250 After Card was sunk, North Vietnam made use of the incident for propaganda purposes. On October 20, 1964, the North Vietnamese government issued a postage stamp which proclaimed an \\"Aircraft Carrier of America sunk in the Harbor of Saigon\\", to praise the Viet Cong commandos who carried out the attack.Thompson, p. 64 The US Navy refused to admit Card had been sunk even for a brief period of time, instead stating Card was damaged and quickly repaired.Thompson, p. 65 For the remainder of 1964, the VC launched further attacks on US targets such as the Brinks Hotel and Bien Hoa Air Base, but there were no significant responses from the US military.Cosmas, p. 172 Card returned to service December 11, 1964 and remained in service until 1970, when she was placed in the Reserve Fleet.

The region has been known by several names, including al-Bashgird, Bashgirdia, Bascardia, Fiyafi Bashqyrt (The Bashqyrt steppes), Pascatir and similar variants. As with previous names, the modern federal subject of Bashkortostan was named after the native Bashkir people. Early history The first settlements in the territory of modern Bashkortostan were set up in the early Paleolithic period. Major expansion, however, occurred during the Bronze Age with the arrival of people from the Abashevo culture. They possessed skills in manufacturing bronze tools, weapons and decorations and they were the first to establish permanent settlements in the region. The ethnonym Bashkirs first became known in the 7th century. According to Ibn Ruste, the Bashkirs were \\"an independent people, occupying territories on both sides of the Ural mountain ridge between Volga, Kama, Tobol and upstream of Yaik river\\". The earliest source to give a geographical description of the territory is Mahmud al-Kashgari's Divanu Lugat’it Turk (1072–1074) which includes a map with a charted region called Fiyafi Bashqyrt (The Bashkir Steppes).Умняков И.

Even earlier, in the 10th century, Ahmad ibn Fadlan mentions \\"the country al-Bashgird\\" in his itinerary and enumerates the rivers he had to cross during his trip.Путешествие Ибн-Фадлана на Волгу.

William of Rubruck,The Journey of William of Rubruk to the Eastern Parts (London, 1900, ) as well as Bashkir epic poetry and genealogies (shejere) suggest that an independent local governance had existed in the region before the 13th century.

Introduction of Islam Islam was introduced to the Baskirs by the Volga Bulgars, who had adopted Islam in the 10th century. One of the earliest remnants of the introduction of Islam is the historical site near Chishmy, Chishminsky District. The site contains a rock with an Arabic inscription saying that Husein-bek, the son of Izmer-bek, resides at the location, who died on the 7th day of the month Muharram in year 444 of Hijra, i.e. 1066 AD. Evidence also exists that Islam came to the Southern Urals from Middle Asia. For example, the 13th century burial site of two Muslim missionaries is preserved in the Bashkir Trans-Uralia, near the village of Starobairamgulovo, Uchalinsky District. Mongol Empire In the 13th century, Historical Bashkortostan fell under the influence of the Mongol Empire. Some sources, including G.Carpine and I.Rudenko, report that Bashkortostan was conquered by Mongols after the fall of Volga Bulgaria. I. Rudenko believes Volga Bulgaria was conquered by Mongols in 1229, while in 1236 \\"...the entire Bashkiria was conquered...\\" Lev Gumilev says, perhaps using Friar Julian’s report as his source, that \\"the war between Mongols and Bashkirs continued for 14 years... The Bashkirs won multiple battles and, after all, concluded a treaty of friendship and cooperation, after which the Mongols forged an alliance with the Bashkirs for further conquests...\\".Гумилев Л. Н. Древняя Русь и Великая Степь. С. 459. In his opinion, this happened in 1220–1223. In Z.I. Enikeev's view, these two statements do not conflict each other. Those Bashkir tribes which were previously controlled by Volga Bulgaria, had to declare themselves dependents of the Mongol Empire after the fall of Bilär. However, the bulk of the Bashkir tribes, headed at that time by Muyten-biy, voluntarily entered the Mongol Empire. The authors of the \\"History of Bashkortostan\\" maintain that the Bashkirs entered the Mongol State in 1207 or 1208, suggesting that \\"the entrance was both promoted by coercion and, at the same time, a voluntary act of recognition\\". In this respect, it is important to cite German Fedorov-Davydov’s opinion, who was an outstanding historian of the Golden Horde. When speaking of the fact that the Bashkirs had their own khan ruling over them, he pointed out that this was a special privilege granted to the Bashkirs as they willfully accepted the Mongol rule; normally, the Mongols would never keep alive the former rulers of the nations they conquered by force.История Башкортостана с древнейших времен до наших дней: В 2 т. / И. Г. Акманов, Н. М. Кулбахтин, А. З. Асфандияров, и др.; Под ред. И. Г. Акманова. Т.1. История Башкортостана с древнейших времен до конца XIX в. — Уфа:Китап, 2004. — 488 с.: ил. — С.66. The very fact that the Bashkirs, as an individual nation, survived while the Mongols exterminated many other peoples who had lived in the adjacency, suggests that special relations existed between the conquerors and the medieval Bashkirs. By 1294, though, the Mongol Empire had fractured, leaving the Bashkirs under the authority of the Golden Horde, one of the Mongol successor states. Russian Empire After the Golden Horde, too, had broken apart, the territory of modern Bashkortostan was divided between the khanates of Kazan and Sibir and the Nogai Horde. After Kazan fell to Ivan IV in October 1552, the Bashkirs joined the Russian Empire. Whether this was voluntary or the result of conquest is still debated. =Accession by negotiation= According to one version, after Ivan's victory over Kazan, the Russian government appealed to the peoples of the khanate, including the western Bashkirs who had been subjects of the Kazan Khanate, to become subjects of the Russian tsar. The neighboring Nogai Horde at that time was stricken with internecine dissention, unrest and famine. Most its population had migrated to the southern steppes and abandoned their camps; however, the danger of Nogai raids remained. The western Bashkirs became subjects of the Russian empire, and received credentials from the tsar confirming their patrimonial rights to their traditional lands as well as to the abandoned Nogai camps. Annexation commemoration As attested in the Bashkir legends, the negotiations with the Russian government's representatives were preceded by Bashkir nationwide meetings at which the annexation terms and conditions were discussed, alongside with who should be sent to \\"the White Padishah\\" as Bashkir delegates. Patents were received from the Russian government which provided detailed description of the annexation terms, defined the land allotments and the taxes; the received patents were then again discussed at nationwide assemblies. The annexation negotiations were expedited by the fact that Kalmucks and later Kazakhs began laying claims on the Bashkirs’ lands. In 1555–[1557], Bashkir councils in central and southern Bashkortostan sent their delegations to Kazan asking the Russian tsar to take them under his protection and patronage. The Bashkir shejere kept the names of the four biys (noblemen) who traveled to Kazan for negotiations: Tatagach-biy (the tribe of Yurmaty), Buranqul-biy (the tribe of Burzyan), Krakujak-biy (the tribe of Qypchaq), and Qanzafar-biy (the tribe of Meñ). The negotiations between the Bashkir noblemen and the Russian tsar's representatives are also attested in the Russian chronicles and testimonies left by the contemporaries. By accepting the Russian citizenship, the Bashkirs confirmed their patrimonial rights to the land, and ensured protection from the Nogay trespassers. =Accession by conquest= Meanwhile, an alternative viewpoint exists, primarily in Western historiography, which maintains that Bashkortostan never joined the Russian Empire of its own volition, but was conquered. This viewpoint is spearheaded by the American historian Alton S. Donnelly,Donelly S. Alton. The Russian Conquest of Bashkiria 1552-1740. Yale University Press, 1968. who analysed the factors of Bashkir's joining the Russian Empire and concluded that Bashkortostan was in fact conquered by the Russians and converted into Russia's internal colony. Donnelly studied tsarist policy adopted after the Bashkirs entered the Russian Empire, and emphasised the fact that the Bashkir rebellion (1662–64) and Bashkir Uprising (1704–11) were primarily caused by the Russian government's violations of the terms and conditions previously agreed between the Bashkirs and the Russian authorities. From this, Alton Donelly concludes that Russia pursued an \\"imperialistic\\" policy in the newly joined Bashkortostan and included a consistent infringement of the Bashkirs’ interests. Russian historians also state that the Bashkir riots were primarily caused by the fact that the Russian government violated the conditions under which Bashkortostan joined the Russian Empire. However, they maintain that this fact cannot give ground to re-evaluations of the accession's circumstances: its free-will basis is attested by both Russian and Bashkir historical sources. =Growth within the Russian Empire= Starting from the second half of the 16th century, Bashkiria's territory began taking shape as a part of the Russian state. In 1798 the Spiritual Assembly of Russian Muslims was established; an indication that the imperial government recognised the rights of Bashkirs, Tatars, and other Muslim nations to profess Islam and perform religious rituals. Ufa Governorate, centred at Ufa, was formed in 1865: another step towards territorial identification. Soviet era After the Russian Revolution, the Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR) was established, firstlyБСЭ т.4 1950 год стр 347 as Little Bashkortostan, but eventually all of Ufa Governorate was incorporated into the newly established republic. During the Soviet period, Bashkiria was granted broad autonomous rights- the first among other Russian regions. The administrative structure of the Bashkir ASSR was based on principles similar to those of other autonomous republics of Russia. The extraction of crude oil in Bashkiria began in 1932. At the end of 1943, large crude oil deposits were discovered. During World War II, Bashkiria became one of the major regions of the Soviet Union to accommodate plants and factories evacuated from Western Russia, as well as great masses of people, as well as providing the country with weaponry, fuel, and foodstuffs. After the war, a good number of industries were further developed there, such as mining, machine construction and, especially, oil-refining. Bashkiria's industry became a solid base for the further economic growth of all European outlying territories of Russia. Modern Bashkortostan On October 11, 1990 the Supreme Soviet of the Republic adopted the Declaration on State Sovereignty of the Bashkir ASSR. On February 25, 1992 the Bashkir ASSR was renamed the Republic of Bashkortostan. On March 31, 1992 a Federative Compact \\"On separation of authorities and powers among federal organs of power of the Russian Federation and the organs of power of the Republic of Bashkortostan\\" was signed. On August 3, 1994 a Compact \\"On separation of authorities and mutual delegating of powers among the organs of power of the Russian Federation and the organs of power of the Republic of Bashkortostan\\" was signed.

It aired on April 18, 2011. Plot The episode starts with Barney and his father, Jerry, parting in 1983 after his mother Loretta forbids them further contact due to Jerry's wild lifestyle. Back in the present, Barney is disappointed in Jerry's normal suburban lifestyle, and is reluctant to pursue any further contact. However, when Jerry invites Barney to go fishing with him and his son JJ, Barney resolves to take his dad out to lead him back to his old \\"party hard\\" lifestyle. He creates alternate identities for the group so as to impress Jerry: Marshall is a playwright in an open marriage with Lily, while Robin and Ted are dating. The next night, the group meets Jerry at MacLaren's where, after a brief discussion on which club to head to, which leads to a confusing exchange as all the clubs they name are named after normal words, like Lame and Okay. They ultimately decide on one called Hopeless. Jerry is reluctant to drink, as he is going fishing with JJ the next day, but finally agrees and begins downing several shots. Jerry and Barney have a great time, eventually roaming the streets of New York and pulling various pranks, such as picking a fight with a heavyset biker and yanking out a parking meter, but are eventually arrested after Jerry throws up on a police car. As they sit handcuffed on the curb, Jerry reveals that he was in fact never drunk, having only pretended to take the shots, while the various pranks really did not happen: due to Barney's drunkenness, he could not tell Jerry was faking, and it was Barney who had thrown up. Jerry wanted to hang out with Barney while at the same time showing him he cannot keep partying forever. However, because Jerry is also an aspiring magician, like Barney, they manage to free themselves from the handcuffs, and head back to Jerry's house, getting a ride with one of Jerry's driving students so that he can make it on time for the fishing trip. On the ride back, Barney asks Jerry how he managed to settle down and live a \\"normal\\" life, and confides that someday he too wishes to settle down. Jerry tells him he will not reveal his secret, but says he must first meet the right girl. Barney says that maybe he has already met the right girl. When they arrive at the house, Jerry produces a memento from their last day together when Barney was a kid: the \\"Legalize It\\" button they had gotten together, and expresses how much it meant to him over the intervening years. Barney then decides to go fishing with Jerry and his son. Meanwhile, Marshall and Lily make a bet to see who can pick up five numbers from people at the club the fastest, with either winner getting to have sex in the bathroom. Lily ends up winning, though Marshall claims to have “won the race” of the prize. Robin runs into an old crush of hers at the club; before she has a chance to ask him out, Ted claims to be dating her, to keep up the ruse for Jerry. Robin had met the man several years before at a clothing store; Ted realizes he and Robin had been dating at the time, and promptly decides to announce to everyone in the club that he and Robin are to get married, ruining any chance Robin has with the man. Robin points out Ted's hypocrisy as had only bought his red cowboy boots that day because another woman had told him he would look good in them. As the gang head home, Lily apologizes for Robin's secret crush not working out. Robin replies that it is okay, and maybe it was not meant to be. Lily asks her why she is smiling and she says she does not know. Meanwhile, Robin's crush talks to someone on his cell phone saying that he met \\"that\\" girl again and that she is engaged to Ted. Future Ted hints there would be more between them later. Reception Donna Bowman of the A.V. Club graded the episode an A−. She stated that the episode has moments that are part of people's transformation into married adults, and Barney's moments with his father are a step in the right direction, while praising John Lithgow's acting as definitive of the episode. Henry Hanks of CNN.com's Marquee blog stated the episode was a \\"great example\\" of emotional arcs filling up the show. Vlada Gelman of Showtracker.com said the episode dropped clues about the wedding seen in \\"Big Days\\" and added speculation as to whether Robin or Nora is the \\"right girl\\". Robert Canning of IGN rated the episode 8.5 out of 10, saying that the episode paid homage to the history of the series and added much laughs in the process. This is the second least viewed episode of the entire series, and only earned 6.49 million viewers.

In a research career spanning more than half a century, Bose published 120 papers on various aspects of fungi in an array of academic journals across Europe, America, and Asia. Bose is credited for pioneering work on mycology and the antibacterial properties of fungi.  Biography  =Early years= Sahay Ram Bose was born on 15 February 1888. =Career= Bose was Professor of Botany in Bangabasi College in 1909, and Carmichael Medical College in 1916. In 1918 he went to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) on a deputation to the Royal Botanical Gardens, Perudeniya for training in systematic of Bengal Polyporacae (bracket fungi) under the famous mycologist Tom Petch. Polyporaceae became the subject for his lifetime study. Bose published his findings in Polyporaceae of Bengal, a monograph in 11 parts with photo-prints, between 1918 and 1947. Bose’s work on ‘Golgi Bodies’ in the basidia of Polypraceae attracted criticism from renowned Botanist J. B. Gatenby. The debate that ensued was covered in several issues of ‘'Nature'’ between 1927 and 1929. Ultimately Bose’s views prevailed. Bose's paper on \\"the spore- forming bacterium on rice grains\\" in Lancet in May 1924 refuted the old \\"rice-toxin\\" theory of Knowles, Acton and Chopra. Bose’s comments on the problem of wheat rust were published in issues of ‘'Nature'’ (1950) and ‘'Science’' (1953). He investigated luminous fungi and ant-hill fungi from termite nests. He proved with the help of P.W.Wilson of Wisconsin University that, contrary to prevailing view, Phoma casuarinae did not fix nitrogen directly from the air. Bose studied edible fungi in India and advised widely on their cultivation. One of the crowning achievements of Bose was his discovery of two antibiotics obtained from higher fungi, polyporin from Polistictus sanguineus and campestrin from Psalliota campestris, which were not concentrated. He studied the effects of radiation on some polypores in culture in 1938. Bose worked as a Director of Research under the C.N.R.S of the government of France from 1957 to 1959, for which he studied the movement of chemicals from the host trees with isotope P32 that induced the formation of bracket fungi on the tree. Bose built up over the years a herbarium for bracket fungi by collections from different parts of the world. The herbarium, containing about 4000 specimens of Polyporaceae, was entered in the list of World Herberia, Index Herbarium, Utrecht, Netherlands. It includes one specimen contributed by Emperor Hirohito of Japan, who was an amateur Botanist. The herbarium is now housed in the Presidency College, now Presidency University, of which Bose is an alumnus. His collection of local and foreign reprints of about 1000 packages is also located at the College.  Awards  * Three-time winner of the Griffith Memorial Prize of Calcutta University in 1925, 1927 and 1929 for studies on higher fungi. * Winner of Bruhl Memorial Medal & Barclay Memorial Medal of Asiatic Society in 1947 and 1953, respectively. * Bose was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1925 and Honorary Member of Societa Internationale di Microbiologia of Italy since 1930. * Elected fellow of National Institute of Sciences of India at the first year of its election of Fellows in 1935. * President of the Botany section of the Indian Science Congress in 1937 and twice President of the Botanical Society of India for 1937 and 1938. * Elected Honorary Member and Fellow of the Bengal Botanical Society in 1965 and of the Indian Phytopathological Society in 1964.

Since November 2015 RGS is undergoing a rebuild, a new campus on the same site is due to be completed by August 2016. In February 2016 RGS was placed into special measures after an Ofsted inspection rated the school as 'inadequate'. The inspection highlighted problems with leadership, management and quality of teaching at the school.

Initially analyzed by Jacques Lacan, he 'became the first French \\"Lacanian\\"'.Elisabeth Roudinesco, Jacques Lacan (Oxford 1997) p. 248 Subsequently he developed into 'one of the most respected and distinguished of all French analysts'.David Macey, \\"Introduction\\", Jacques Lacan, The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis (London 1994) p.xxxii Career Leclaire was born in 1924 in Strasbourg under the name Liebschutz, his family changing their name in wartime to escape persecution. Initially interested in Eastern philosophy, he then turned to psychoanalysis, and studied medicine and psychiatry in Paris (where he met Wladimir Granoff). He successfully defended his medical dissertation in 1957. =Psychoanalytic politics= At the start of the fifties, Lacan 'was beginning to gather round him the most brilliant members of the third generation of French psychoanalysis. Among them were the musketeers of the future troika: Serge Leclaire, Wladimir Granoff, and Francois Perrier'.Roudinesco, p. 196 All three followed Lacan into the Societe Francaise de Psychanalyse during the 1953 split. There Leclaire 'was made an associate member in 1954 and served as secretary from 1957 to 1962. He became president of the society in 1963, the year of the second split of the French psychoanalytic groups'.Sedat He was also, between 1961 and 1965, a member of the International Psychoanalytical Association (IPA). Leclaire believed passionately that 'any break between Lacan and the IPA would be a calamity at once for Freudianism in France, for Lacan, and for the IPA',Roudinesco, p. 248 and worked tirelessly to prevent one on Lacan's behalf. He was ultimately unsuccessful, and indeed Lacan, despite the way 'Leclaire kept him informed of every important development' eventually 'accused Leclaire of betraying him'.Roudinesco, p. 255 Notwithstanding, Leclaire followed Lacan into the Ecole Freudienne de Paris, founded in 1964, but continued to work on the unification of French psychoanalysis. In 1969, Leclaire was the originator of the first Department of Psychoanalysis at the University of Paris VIII (Vincennes), a project first opposed and then taken over by Lacan. After the latter's death, and the disintegration of the Lacanian movement, 'Serge Leclaire had refused to found a school; he wanted to give the younger generation a chance. But ten years later he made a great come-back on the French psychoanalytic scene'Roudinesco, p. 430 in an attempt to reuify the fragmented Lacanians. '\\"His initiative triggered things off. To begin with, everyone was against the founding of an order...But his analysis of the situation was accurate\\"'.Roudinesco, p. 431 'Because of his unique position and his intellectual openness, he was able to maintain friendly relations with numerous colleagues from different schools in spite of splits and divisions'.Sedat Writings In the fifties, Leclaire's writings might at times come close to the parody-picture whereby 'Lacanians mirror the master...a Lacanian ventriloquist's dummy'Adam Phillips, On Flirtation (London 1994) p. 162 On fantasy, 'Serge Leclaire, who is summarizing Lacan's thinking on the fantasm in the late 1950s, points out that the fantasm is at the heart of the dream'Herman Rapaport, Between the Sign and the Gaze (1994) p. 21 in orthodox Lacanian fashion. Similarly orthodox is his 1959 study of the obsessional \\"Philo\\", where he stresses that 'the psychoanalysts must...introduce a cleavage between demand and desire, between the world of the law and that of the dream'; and, on the role of the father, that 'this third person, the father, appears especially as a being to whom one refers (to honor or to scorn)...as to a law'.Serge Leclaire, \\"Philo, or the Obsessional and His Desire, in Stuart Schneiderman, Returning to Freud (New York 1980) p. 129 and p. 121 When preparing to present his famous analysis of the dream of the Unicorn with Jean Laplanche at the Symposium of Bonneval in 1960, the two disciples found themselves in disagreement, and 'this difference of opinion severely disturbed Leclaire',Michael Vannoy Adams, The Mythological Unconscious (2001) p. 357 still very much the good pupil. Lacan indeed referred 'to what my pupil Leclaire contributed, at the Congres de Bonneval, by way of an application of my theses....'Leclaire's work illustrates particularly well the crossing of significant interpretation towards signifying non-sense...thus enabling him to introduce into his sequence a whole chain in which his desire is animated'.Lacan, Fundamental p.212 and p. 250 In his subsequent book Psychoanalyzing, Leclaire 'emphasizes that he interprets the desire to drink not physically but psychically' in the unicorn dream: '\\"Li\\" is the signifier that leads from \\"Lili\\" to \\"lolo\\" to \\"licorne\\" [unicorn]...these puns extend from infantile oral desire to adult genital desire'.Adams, p. 363-4 Similarly centred on the signifier is his work on erotogenicity. 'The erotogenic body, he proposes, is a symbolic or represented body':M. K. Blasing, Lyric Poetry (2007) p. 78 'erogeneity depends closely on the \\"sexual value\\" projected onto the child's body by another'.Roland Gori, \\"Erotogenicity\\" By the start of the seventies, however, Lacan was increasingly turning from his old doctrines of the signifier and the Symbolic, in favour of new mathematical formulations, and 'despite many attempts, especially by Serge Leclaire, to maintain links between the majority of clinicians in the EFP'Roudinesco, p. 344 and the new approach, a gulf with his old master inevitably loomed. Indeed, by 1975 Leclaire concluded publicly 'that whilst the mathemes might have a certain pedagogic utility, they were basically no more than \\"graffiti\\"'.Macey, p. xxxii As 'Lacan had a hard time tolerating the autonomy of his pupils', not least with 'Serge Leclaire, the most senior of the group',Elisabeth Roudinesco, Jacques Lacan & Co (1990) p. 573 despite the latter's continuing personal loyalty, the two men inevitably drifted apart. It is then perhaps not surprising that much of Leclaire's later work addresses questions of autonomy and its stages - 'The goal of the analysis does, as Serge Leclaire used to say, depend on our ability to speak in the first person...but only after we have spoken in the third person'D-R Dufour, The Art of Shrinking Heads (2007) p. 135  and of the problems of finding a distinctive voice.

It was aired on May 2, 2011. Plot In the cold open, Future Ted narrates that when Marshall resigned from GNB, his boss Arthur Hobbs asked to be put as his character reference when applying for a new job at an environmental organization. However, the organization rejects his application, revealing that Hobbs gave them negative feedback by recalling his supposed unprofessionalism and stories about his disdain for the environment (including clubbing a seal with an even cuter seal). Marshall returns to GNB to confront Hobbs and runs into Zoey, who offers him a job as her group's lawyer. At MacLaren's, Barney hands out invitations to the Arcadian's demolition. Zoey introduces Marshall as her lawyer, which upsets Barney because he helped Marshall land a job at GNB in the first place. He launches a prank war against Marshall by doing questionable disgusting things to anything Marshall's mouth touches and sending photographs to him. Marshall retaliates by ruining Barney's hookups at the bar over several days, for instance by pretending to be a doctor and telling Barney he had crabs with \\"super-herpes\\". The pranks go too far and Carl bans them both from the bar, as well as Lily and Robin, who were irritated by a woman lurking by their booth for a chance for her and her friends to sit there. Meanwhile, Ted goes off to spend the weekend out of town with Zoey at Martha's Vineyard. When Lily tells him what happened between Marshall and Barney, he confronts Zoey while on the road, despite an agreement to never talk about the Arcadian, and told her that it was okay for her to disrupt his own plans, but seeing his friends turn on each other was too much. Ted proposes that if Zoey can spend one night in the decrepit hotel, she will have him on her side to save it from demolition, a proposal which Zoey accepts. Ted asks her why saving the Arcadian was so important to Zoey. She reveals that she grew up in the hotel as a child, and its destruction would see part of her identity gone with it. When they see the cockamouse creep around the room and discover its offspring, Zoey admits defeat and they spend the night at Ted's apartment. Distraught by the rift, Lily and Robin decide to have Marshall and Barney make up using various drinks and discover that certain party drinks trigger various situations — daiquiris makes Marshall narcissistic, red wine brings out Barney's self-pitying side, while absinthe makes Robin hallucinate and martinis exacerbate Lily's attraction to Robin. Armed with this knowledge, the two plan a drinking binge for Marshall and Barney by ordering drinks in such a way that they would get angry at each other first, then eventually reconcile. However, while the plan is underway, Marshall and Barney drink tequila shots and return to MacLaren's, where Barney tries to hit on a lesbian and Marshall eats chicken wings while smoking. The two forgive each other after Carl gives them beer and he lifts the ban on the four. However, a round of champagne that Lily ordered results in Marshall and Barney blacking out and resuming their feud at Ted's apartment the next morning, which is only worsened when Ted tells them he is on Zoey's side as well. Seeing their plan go to waste, Robin suggests that she and Lily drink absinthe, which puts them in a dream-like state. The last scene of the episode shows Lily and Robin pulling a prank on the women who stole their booth. When Barney's assistant shows the women a photograph, they scramble out of the bar in disgust. Lily and Robin immediately come back to clean up the booth. Reception Reviews of the episode were mixed. The A.V. Club's Zack Handlen gave the episode a B−, stating the prank war was funny, but the execution of the drink gag was not well-timed. Lindsey Bahr of Atlantic Monthly said it had \\"fast-paced energy\\" that the Zoey and Ted angle spoils, and nothing is resolved by the end of the episode. James Poniewozik of Time.com said the episode was a \\"single, extended running gag.\\" References External links * How I Met Your Mother (season 6) episodes 2011 American television episodes ","title":"The Perfect Cocktail"},{"id":"31530382","text":"\\"Landmarks\\" is the 23rd episode of the sixth season of the CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother and the 135th episode overall. It aired on May 9, 2011. Plot Marshall presents his case for preserving the Arcadian at a meeting of the Landmark Preservation Commission (LPC), where the fate of the Arcadian would be decided once and for all. When Ted is called up to present his opinion, Future Ted explains how difficult it was for him to come to his decision. Ever since Zoey had explained how she had grown up in the Arcadian, Ted had sided with her, hoping to keep their relationship strong. However, Barney learns from his boss Arthur Hobbs that not only will Ted be fired if the project does not go through, but Barney will also be fired for having suggested Ted as the architect in the first place. When Ted hears of this, he refuses to budge, but Robin explains that no matter what happens to the Arcadian, his relationship with Zoey will end badly: Zoey will feel betrayed if the Arcadian is not accepted as a landmark, otherwise Ted will blame Zoey for ruining his own dreams. Ted soon has a dream with Barney dressed up as the original architect of the Arcadian. He convinces Ted that the Arcadian must go, as being able to design a building in New York would undoubtedly help his career and future. The next day at the LPC meeting, Ted ultimately says he does not wish for the Arcadian to be preserved. This prompts Zoey to present voice recordings of Ted saying how he was in support of the Arcadian's preservation, particularly mentioning its ornate stonework of a lion head. With the LPC poised to give a decision the next morning, Ted is saddened to realize they will vote to preserve the Arcadian, causing him and Barney to lose their jobs. However, Lily comes up with a plan to have the Arcadian demolished. They go to Hobbs to explain their plan, but Hobbs is upset about losing everything, including his dog Tugboat, to his divorce. Marshall hugs Hobbs to comfort him, resolving their feud, and Lily then explains her plan on the condition that Ted and Barney keep their jobs, but Future Ted says that he cannot mention the specifics for legal reasons. The next day, the LPC explain although they had been persuaded by Ted's description of the lion head stonework to preserve the Arcadian, the lion head had vanished the night before (the group got two construction workers to remove it), thus prompting them to ultimately decide not to preserve the Arcadian. Realizing what has happened, Zoey angrily confronts Ted; when he says sometimes things have to fall apart to make way for better things, she silently storms out on him, ending their relationship. Later that night, Ted calls Barney so Barney can complain about Zoey. However, Barney admits that Zoey may have been right about the lion head, which he had mounted on a wall in his room. Reception The A.V. Club's Donna Bowman gave the episode a B+ rating. This is the least viewed episode of the entire series, and only earned 6.41 million viewers.

Ted mentions that he ran into his ex-girlfriend Zoey after breaking up and she asked to get coffee, which Robin and Barney say is a signal that she wants to get back together. The episode flashes-forward to September 2011. Marshall is feeling down, so Lily decides to get them both some of their favorite soup from a filthy rundown restaurant, but Lily gets ill and begins throwing up presumably from terrible food poisoning. Desperate to stop Marshall from eating any, she runs from the school to their house, where she stops him before he takes a spoonful of his third bowl. Marshall has a business meeting with a prospective employer and has figured out the time when he'll begin vomiting. After disgusting images and stories, Marshall runs out of the room to vomit. He comes home and lies down to get some rest before his \\"countdown\\" finishes. He wakes up the following morning to find out that he was not ill and Lily is pregnant. Ted is distraught about the lighting for the new building and decides that this warrants getting back together with Zoey. He decides to meet her and buys an orchid like he first did, but Barney and Robin stop him. While on their way to stop Ted, they have a tender moment, but decide they need to move on. Barney lets Ted press the button to blow up the Arcadian, and Barney meets Nora again, and asks her to coffee, which Nora accepts. Robin becomes upset as she sees that Barney wants to get back together with Nora.

Ted goes inside to check on the groom, who is Barney. Production According to show co- creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas, a majority of this Season 6 finale takes place in September instead of May \\"so we can pick up Season 7 exactly where we left off\\". Said Thomas, \\"This is the first time in the history of our show we're doing a finale that is not set in May. We jump ahead to September, basically to the beginning of next season.\\" This episode was shot with extra security because of the two major revelations at the end: Lily being pregnant and Barney being the groom at the future wedding.

In 1775, the Royal Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans was built with a part dedicated to house workers. In the 19th century the cités ouvrières (company towns) appeared, inspired by the Phalanstère of Charles Fourier. After World War II the population increased at a rate previously unknown, the rural exodus increased and war damage had reduced the number of houses in many cities. Rental prices dramatically rose so the government passed a rent control law in 1949. That effectively ended the economic benefits of housing investment. Also, construction was strictly regulated, which made building very difficult without political support. The government launched a huge construction plan, including the creation of new towns (\\"villes nouvelles\\") and new suburbs with HLM (Habitation à Loyer Modéré, \\"low-rent housing\\"). The state had the money and the legal means to acquire the land and could provide some advantages to the companies that built the huge housing complexes of hundreds of apartments. Quality was also effectively regulated, resulting in decent or even top- quality housing for the 1950s and 1960s. HLM construction was also a major source of political financing, and building companies were sometimes made to pay back the political party of the mayor who launched an HLM program. That resulted in corruption scandals in the Paris region and elsewhere. In 1998, a law required every town in France to have at least 20% HLM.Article 55 of the Applies to towns of more than 3,500 inhabitants (1,500 in Île-de-France) located in urban agglomerations of more than 50,000 inhabitants, with at least one commune of more than 15,000 inhabitants.

The most accepted source is a New Year's Eve religious service in the 1300s. Reference has been made to a source originating in a battle song of the year 912 by Notker the Stammerer, a monk of the Abbey of Saint Gall, however, the Synod of Cologne declared in 1316 that no one should sing this without the prior permission of the residing bishop.  Text  Media vita in morte sumus quem quaerimus adjutorem nisi te, Domine, qui pro peccatis nostris juste irasceris? Sancte Deus, sancte fortis, sancte et misericors Salvator: amarae morti ne tradas nos. In the midst of life we are in death of whom may we seek for succour, but of thee, O Lord, who for our sins art justly displeased? Yet, O Lord God most holy, O Lord most mighty, O holy and most merciful Saviour, deliver us not into the bitter pains of eternal death. The English translation is a poetic adaption from the Book of Common Prayer. Latin liturgical use In the York Breviary \\"Media vita\\" was sung as an antiphon at Compline on the Fourth Sunday of Lent, Laetare. In the Sarum Breviary it was the antiphon from the Third (Oculi) to the Fifth (Judica) Sundays of Lent, a position it also occupies (in reduced format) in the Dominican Rite. In addition to its uses in the ordinary liturgy, \\"Media vita\\" was sung as a hymn to ask God for aid in times of public need, and sometimes even as a sort of curse. In 1455 a group of nuns in Wennigsen, resisting the attempt of the Augustinian canon Johannes Busch and Duke William of Brunswick to reform their house, \\"lay down on their bellies in the choir with the arms and legs stretched out in the form of a cross, and bawled all through, at the top of their voices, the anthem \\"In the midst of life we are in death\\" ... Wherefore the Duke was afraid, and feared lest his whole land should go to ruin.\\" Busch assured the Duke that no harm could come from the chant, so he responded to the nuns: \\"How were ye not afraid to sing the anthem \\"Media vita\\" over me? I stretch my fingers to God's holy gospels, and swear that ye must reform yourselves, or I will not suffer you in my land.\\" In the Ambrosian Rite, \\"Media vita\\" was said with the Litany of the Saints on the Tuesday before Christmas, the Wednesday before Palm Sunday, and the Greater Rogation on 25 April. Adaptations Popular in the Baroque period, the Latin phrase was translated into the vernacular early and has continued to circulate especially widely in German and English, in literature and in song. = German = \\"Media vita\\" appears in Hartmann von Aue's Middle High German narrative poem Der arme Heinrich (V. 93f.). In 1524, Martin Luther translated it as \\"Mytten wir ym leben synd\\" and consequently it is now in the Evangelisches Gesangbuch hymnbook as number 518, or 654 in the Gotteslob hymnbook.

Graham initially trained as an actor at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art. He directed his first plays at the Pegasus Theatre (home of the Oxford Youth Theatre), in East Oxford, in his teens. He devised his first piece in 1982, entitled A Way Of Life, under the benevolent eye of the theatre manager there, Fred Ritchings. A further devised piece, Yop!, played to packed houses at the Pegasus Theatre in 1983. Approach It was during his time at Pegasus Theatre that Graham developed his approach to devising theatre, which is predominantly realistic in style and based on Konstantin Stanislavski's writings. Graham's method of working starts with an initial period of exploring characters through improvisations. Following detailed director's notes, then presents complex scenarios to the actors. The resulting scenes are reworked with copious notes after each run. The script is fixed by Graham one to two weeks before opening night. In the early days, a written play text would only emerge following the show's stage run. However this did not preclude actors being given sections of dialogue penned by Graham as the piece developed, an approach that became increasingly predominant. Graham was in a fight in prison and blamed his part on \\"Frank\\". Career Graham teamed up with West End theatre actress Sarah Scott in 1985, for his production of Children of a Lesser God performed in Oxford. This collaboration with Scott saw the beginning of Graham's exploration on themes of disability, particularly deafness. Between 1987 - 1994 Graham and Scott performed signed songs as part of several series and one-off programmes for Channel 4 introducing the form to a mainstream UK audience for the first time. They also performed in International Disability Arts Festivals UK, USA, Holland and Germany. In 1988, Graham began work on a major new work, Gary, involving both hearing and deaf actors. This premiered at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, in 1989, winning a Fringe First award. The piece returned to London, playing at the Arts Theatre in the West End, in 1990. Graham's groundbreaking drama Sympathy For The DevilPublished in GRAEAE Plays 1, Aurora Metro Publications, 2002. resulted from a collaboration with Graeae Theatre Company at the Oval House Theatre and then the Tricycle Theatre in 1996. This went on to take a Raspberry Ripple Award the same year. The Guardian′s theatre review pages said of the play: \\"It is rare and rewarding to find a piece as dense and intelligent as this.\\" Success followed on television, with Graham writing and directing two BAFTA winning plays (Strong Language for Channel 4 in 2000, and Lion Mountain for the BBC in 2003).BAFTA Database. His other television work includes writing and directing a Rush series for Channel 4. Four series of this drama were aired in the UK between 1998 and 2003, telling the story of a group of deaf friends who first met at college in series one.

Distribution It is known from southern Louisiana and south- western Mississippi. It originally may have been endemic to forested wetlands, but has undergone a population explosion and expansion of its range since 1983. Description The length of the forewings is 6.8-8.5 mm for males and 8–10 mm for females. Biology The larvae feed on Taxodium distichum and are considered a serious pest of that tree species. There is one generation per year, with overwintering egg masses attached to the bark of thin twigs of the host plant in obligate diapause. Dormant eggs hatch by bud break of baldcypress trees during late February and early March. The first instar larvae disperse and seek out the terminal portions of expanding foliage, burrow within the cluster of young needles and begin feeding. They feed on the opening leaf buds and elongating leaves. As the foliage expands, developing larvae produce silk to roll adjacent needles and branchlets into a tight mass, surrounding themselves individually and then feeding on the foliage inside. Larvae undergo five larval instars before pupation. Adults emerge between late April and mid May. Etymology The species is named for Richard A. Goyer of the Department of Entomology, Louisiana Agricultural Experiment Station, Louisiana State University Agricultural Center, Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He collected the holotype as well as most of the paratypes, and is responsible for the majority of the research on the biology and ecology of the species. External links *Archips goyerana, n. sp.

It is responsible for civil registration, the census in Scotland, demography and statistics, family history and the national archives and historical records. National Records of Scotland was formed from the merger of the General Register Office for Scotland and the National Archives of Scotland in 2011, and combines all the functions of the two former organisations. The offices of Registrar General for Scotland and Keeper of the Records of Scotland remain separate, but since 2011 both have been vested ex officio in the Chief Executive of National Records of Scotland, currently Paul Lowe. Location View of Register House from North Bridge, looking across Princes Street. National Records of Scotland is based in HM General Register House on Princes Street in the New Town in Edinburgh. The building was designed by Robert Adam for the Register House Trustees, and was opened to the public in 1788. History :For earlier history, see Lord Clerk Register, General Register Office for Scotland and National Archives of Scotland . The first official tasked with the care and administration of the public records was first recorded in the role of Clericus Rotulorum (Clerk of the Rolls) in the Kingdom of Scotland in 1286. Registers, rolls and records were kept in Edinburgh Castle from about the 13th century. The role of the Clerk of the Rolls eventually became known as the Lord Clerk Register, the oldest surviving great offices of state in Scotland.A L Murray 'The Lord Clerk Register' 53 Scot Hist Rev 2 No 156, pp 124–156 (October 1974) However, records held by the Scottish Crown did not typically include personal data such as birth, death and marriage records. Instead, the clergy and other officials of the Church of Scotland kept parish records, which recorded personal data such as baptisms and marriages, but only for their own church members so parish records were limited in scope. In 1551, a council of Scottish clergy enacted that all parish ministers should keep a record of baptisms, burials and marriages. However, in 1801, the first national Census found that, out of the 850 parishes in Scotland, not more than 99 had regular registers. This was in part due to sporadic recording keeping and accidental destruction of registers. In 1806, a Royal Warrant established the office of Deputy Clerk Register,Royal Warrant 1906: National Archives of Scotland C3/24, No 184. effectively reducing the record keeping duties of the Lord Clerk Register to an honorary title with no day-to-day management of the Registers and Records of Scotland. However, personal data continued to be managed by the clergy, now largely ministers of the Church of Scotland. The Industrial revolution radically changed the population demographics of Scotland, with central belt parishes being swamped by migrants from the Highlands and Lowlands which also contributed to the poor record keeping in registers. A bill came before the United Kingdom Parliament in 1829 and several others in subsequent years to introduce a system of state registration, following the similar introduction of public registration in England & Wales in 1837, but the bills were unsuccessful. One of the main reasons they were unsuccessful was the opposition, including the Church of Scotland, to attempts in the bills to reform the Scots laws of marriage, which had historically been very informal as The Scotsman newspaper describes: > \\"Everybody knows that, by the law of Scotland, the marriage ceremony can be > performed with as perfect legal effect by a blacksmith as by a clergyman\\" However, the proposals for reform were dropped and in 1854, the Deputy Clerk Register's duties were also extended to the care of the records of births, deaths and marriages in the role of Registrar General under the Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages (Scotland) Act 1854, which established the General Registry Office of Births, Deaths and Marriages. The 1854 Act also provided that the Registrar General should produce an annual report to be forwarded to the Home Secretary to be laid before Parliament, containing a general abstract of the numbers of births, deaths and marriages registered during the previous year. The first general abstract (relating to 1855) was submitted in 1856. By the time of his first annual detailed report, published in 1861, the first Registrar General for Scotland, William Pitt Dundas, claimed that: \\"there is good reason for believing that very few births indeed now escape registration.\\"Higgs, Edward, The development of the General Register Office (Scotland) Retrieved 26 March 2016 In 1855 and 1860, two further Acts, the Registration (Scotland) Act, 1855 (18 & 19 Vict., c.29) and the Registration (Scotland, Amendment) Act, 1860 (23 & 24 Vict., c.85), were passed which amended some of the sections of the 1854 Act. The 1854 Act had placed considerable burdens on the sheriffs of the Scottish counties, who had already played a role in the taking of decennial censuses. The amending Acts reduced their responsibilities by appointing registration district examiners to inspect the registers. They also made revised provision for the transmission of the parochial registers up to the year 1820 to the General Register Office Scotland (GROS), and the registers for the years 1820–1855 to the custody of the local registrars. These registers were to be retained by the local registrars for 30 years, after which they were to be sent to the GROS. In 1879, The Lord Clerk Register (Scotland) Act 1879 further provided that the office of Lord Clerk Register would remain as a ceremonial Great Officer of State,Lord Clerk Register (Scotland) Act 1879 (c 44), ss 1, 2. with all record keeping duties passing to the Deputy Clerk Register.Lord Clerk Register (Scotland) Act 1879 (c 44), section 6. In 1909 by Sir James Patten McDougall was appointed as Deputy Clerk Register, the last holder of the combined offices of Registrar General and Deputy Lord Clerk Register. The Registrar General (Scotland) Act 1920 provided for the appointment by the Secretary of State for Scotland of a full-time Registrar General, separate from the Deputy Clerk Register. The recording of personal data was in effect severed from the Deputy Clerk Register, who continued to maintain the records and registers of Scotland. Dr James Crawford Dunlop, who had served as medical superintendent of statistics since 1904, held the office of Registrar General from 1921 to 1930. The 12 subsequent Registrars General were drawn from the civil service in Scotland and headed the General Register Office for Scotland independently from the Deputy Clerk Register. In 1928, the office of Deputy Clerk Register itself was abolished by the Reorganisation of Offices (Scotland) Act 1928, becoming the Keeper of the Registers and Records of Scotland. However, it came to be recognised that the keeping of records and the keeping of registers was too cumbersome a task to be entrusted to a single department.Report by the Committee of the Scottish Records Advisory Council, July 1943 (National Archives of Scotland HH1/1832) In 1948, the Public Registers and Records (Scotland) Act 1948 provided that the Registers of Scotland and Records of Scotland were to be split into two separate government organisations with two separate officials: (1) the Keeper of the Registers of Scotland and (2) the Keeper of the Records of Scotland. The Keeper of the Registers of Scotland was given the duties to maintain and preserve the General Register of Sasines, the Register of Hornings, the Register of Inhibitions and Adjudications, the Register of Deeds and other chancery and judicial registers.Public Registers and Records (Scotland) Act 1948 s.1(2) The Keeper of the Records of Scotland, was given the duties to preserve the public registers, records and rolls of Scotland.Public Registers and Records (Scotland) Act 1948 s.1(3). From 1949, the Keeper of the Registers headed the Department of the Registers of Scotland. The Keeper of the Records of Scotland headed the Records Office, later called the National Archives of Scotland.

In the case of pro-union violence, a goon squad may be formed by union leaders to intimidate or assault non-union workers, strikebreakers, or parties who do not cooperate with the directives of union leadership. In the case of anti-union violence, goon squads are traditionally hired by employers as an attempt at union busting, and resort to many of the same tactics, including intimidation, espionage, and assault. During the labor unrest of the late 19th century in the United States, businessmen hired Pinkerton agent goon squads to infiltrate unions, and as guards to keep strikers and suspected unionists out of factories. One of the best known such confrontations was the Homestead Strike of 1892, in which Pinkerton agents were called in to enforce the strikebreaking measures of Henry Clay Frick, acting on behalf of Andrew Carnegie, who was abroad; the ensuing conflicts between Pinkerton agents and striking workers led to several deaths on both sides. The Pinkertons were also used as guards in coal, iron, and lumber disputes in Illinois, Michigan, New York and Pennsylvania, as well as the Great Railroad Strike of 1877. In some cases, corporations have been formed specifically to provide the services of goon squads. The Corporations Auxiliary Company was a corporation created to conduct \\"the administration of industrial espionage\\",Richard C. Cabot, Introduction, The Labor Spy--A Survey of Industrial Espionage, by Sidney Howard and Robert Dunn, Under the Auspices of the Cabot Fund for Industrial Research, published in the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen's Magazine, Volume 71, Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen, 1921, page 27 providing goon squads and labor spies in exchange for payment. In 1921 the Corporations Auxiliary Company was known to masquerade under a dozen different names, and specialized at electing its agents to union office in order to control or destroy unions.Sidney Howard, The Labor Spy, A Survey of Industrial Espionage, Chapter 1, The New Republic, reprinted in Mixer and server, Volume 30, Hotel and Restaurant Employee's International Alliance and Bartenders' International League of America, April 15, 1921, page 43 Etymology The term \\"goon\\" was reputedly coined by F. L. Allen in 1921,John Ayton. The Oxford Dictionary of Slang (1998), pg. 309 perhaps a variant of the US slang \\"gooney\\" which had been around since at least 1872, meaning a simpleton or fool,John Ayton. The Oxford Dictionary of Slang (1998), pg. 308 which may have derived from \\"gony\\", applied by sailors to the albatross and similar big, clumsy birds (c.1839). In the late 1930s, E. C. Segar’s comic strip Popeye had a character named \\"Alice the Goon\\". It was from this character that large stupid people or stupid things came to popularly be called \\"goons\\" and the term entered into general use. Robert Hendrickson. Word and Phrase Origins, 4th ed., Facts on File, 2008, pg. 358. \\"Goon\\" evolved into slang for a thug (1938), someone hired by racketeers to terrorize political or industrial opponents (1938),John Ayton.

It is designed to assist project managers in developing plans, assigning resources to tasks, tracking progress, managing budgets, requirements, changes and risks as well as analyzing workloads. The tool automatically stores all project results in a central repository shared by all users. Individual project management methods can be supported as well as the agile method Scrum, official methods like the British PRINCE2, the German V-Model XT (Version 1.4), the Swiss HERMES method and methods for the automotive industry according to ISO/IEC 15504, also known as SPICE. The software is available in English and German and has more than 34,000 registered users worldwide. Features In-Step BLUE supports process- based IT-project management with these features: ;Project management, project portfolio management and resource management: :The tool supports project planning and task management by structuring the specific project in phases, iterations, milestone (project management)s, work packages and activities based on the process used. The project plan gets continually updated. Editable product templates for project results are provided and versioned. Individual ToDo-lists are assigned to the team members. The progress of the project, time, cost and effort planning can be reported and monitored at all times as time tracking is integrated. The collaboration software can be accessed by all team members via LAN or internet. In case an organization wants to collectively manage several projects running at the same time, the tool supports cross-project views, reports and evaluations. Available resources of an organization can hence be allocated to several projects. ;Requirements management and change management: :All project stakeholders‘ requirements and changes are documented by use of forms, analyzed and prioritized with the tool. Converted into tasks they are visible in the project plan. in-STEP BLUE provides graphic requirements modeling with the UML and standardized documentation. Automatic document versioning guarantees requirements traceability from documentation to test cases to implementation. ;Configuration management and document management: :All activities and project results are versioned and automatically stored in a central product library. To alter a document it has to be checked out and in again. All changes to a configuration item can be seen in the revision history. Baselines can be used to mark significant states within a series of several changes. ;Risk management: :Identified potential risks can be recorded with the tool. Filter functions support the assessment of risks. When the risks are assessed, counter measures can be planned and integrated in the project plan. ;Quality management : Requirements can be linked with test cases and release processes. The tool supports the planning, scheduling and controlling of quality assurance measures. It tracks all documents relevant to an evaluation and offers automated workflows for reviews and QA-cycles. Individual evaluations of tests and test cases can be implemented. ;Process management :In organizations running several projects process standards can be established. The tool enables the user to tailor the process to best fit a project’s specific needs. Process standards can be deduced and further improvements gained from successful projects. Process maturity can thus be improved according to CMMI. ;Integration with Microsoft programs :in-STEP BLUE is integrated with Microsoft OfficeWord and Excel for corporate documentation. Since version 4.8 it offers features for integration with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 and Microsoft SharePoint. History Version 1.0 of the process and configuration management software in-Step was launched in 1997. Since many companies introduced process-based management according to the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) to improve their software development, the tool was designed to assist project teams in complying with process-based project management. Especially users of the standard for German federal administration and defense, the V-Modell 97, took up the software. In 2002 in-Step integrated core tasks like project, requirements and configuration management resulting in a multi-user-tool. Version 3.0 was released in 2004 and offered new editions for requirements-oriented development, for agile projects according to Extreme Programming and for projects according to PRINCE2. When the new standard for the German federal administration V-Modell XT came out in 2005, a V-Modell XT Edition was launched with features for tailoring the process, project planning and quality assurance. In 2008 in-Step Scrum Edition and in- Step SPICE Edition for Automotive were completed. In 2010 in-Step HERMES Edition for the Swiss project management method was launched. In 2014 in-Step got a new name: in-STEP BLUE as another tool with features for requirements engineering was launched: in-STEP RED.

History 1794 post office notice of reward concerning the robbery of the mail between Chester and Liverpool In the UK stage coach (from 1784 Mail coach) robberies by highwaymen were common, despite the death penalty. For example, in 1722 two were executed for robbing the Bristol mail. Robberies from trains also began early. An early example was on the Bristol and Exeter Railway in 1849. In the USA, the period immediately following the First World War witnessed a large number of mail robberies. Eventually, the frequency of these thefts caused the Department of the Navy to place armed Marines on all mail trains. A number of high-value mail robberies occurred in the UK after the Second World War, as a result of a lack of improvements in security in the transport of money. One major example was the Eastcastle Street robbery in 1952, involving the theft of £287,000 from a post office van in London. Overall that year, 629 mailbags went missing, and in the following year the figure was 738. The two most significant mail robberies both occurred in the early 1960s. In the UK, £2.6 million was taken in the 'Great Train Robbery' of 1963. A year earlier, $1.5 million was stolen from the hold-up of a U.S. Mail truck in Massachusetts. By the end of the 1960s, however, mail robbery had become less common.

Life He was born of poor parents in Buckinghamshire. He matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, on 4 May 1604, and graduated Bachelor of Arts (BA) on 17 October 1607. When he proceeded Oxford Master of Arts (MA Oxon) on 22 June 1610, he was described as of St Mary Hall. Taking holy orders, he became about 1614 chaplain to Edward la Zouche, 11th Baron Zouche of Haringeworth, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports and governor of Dover Castle. After preaching at Dover many sermons before his patron, Reading was on 2 December 1616, at the request of the parishioners, appointed minister of St Mary's Church, Dover. He secured a position of influence in the town, and subsequently became chaplain to Charles I and Bachelor of Divinity (BD) Although his sermons advocated Puritan principles, he supported the king's cause in the English Civil War. In 1642 his study at Dover was plundered by parliamentary soldiers, and he was imprisoned for nineteen months. By direction of Charles I, William Laud, then a prisoner in the Tower of London, gave Reading the rectory of Chartham, Kent, on 27 January 1643. The House of Commons declined to sanction Reading's institution, and appointed Edward Corbett. Laud refused to abandon Reading, and the house passed on that ground an ordinance sequestrating the archbishop's temporalities. A prebend in Canterbury which was bestowed on Reading at the same time brought him no advantage. In July 1644 he was presented by William Brockman to the living of Cheriton, Kent, and in the same year Reading was appointed by the Westminster Assembly to be one of nine commissioned to write annotations on the New Testament. These were published in ‘Annotations upon all the Books of the Old and New Testament, wherein the Text is explained, Doubts resolved, Scriptures paralleled, and various Readings observed,’ London, 1645, 1651, and 1657. But shortly after 1645, on the discovery of a plot for the capture of Dover Castle by the royalists, he was arrested by command of Major John Boys, and hurried to Dover Castle, and next day to Leeds Castle. There he composed the “Guide to the Holy City.”’ He was at length discharged by the parliamentary committee for Kent, and the restitution of his goods was ordered; but his livings were sequestered. On 8 January 1647 he was a prisoner in the Fleet Prison. On 10 March 1650 he attacked the right of unordained preaching in a public disputation with the baptist Samuel Fisher of Folkestone. Fisher used arguments from Jeremy Taylor's “Discourse of the Liberty of Prophesying,”’ which Reading had already criticised in print. Reading was restored to his Dover living shortly before the English Restoration of 1660. On 25 May 1660 he presented to Charles II, on his first landing, a large bible with gold clasps, in the name of the corporation of Dover, and made a short speech, which was published as a broadside. He was shortly afterwards restored to Chartham, made canon of the eighth prebend of Canterbury, and reinstituted to Cheriton on 18 July . In October following the university of Oxford conferred on him the degree of Doctor of Divinity (DD) per literas regias. Before August 1662 he resigned the living at Dover. He died on 26 October 1667, and was buried on the 30th in the parish church of Chartham. His son Thomas, of Christ Church, Oxford, born in 1623, proceeded MA Oxon in July 1647 when ‘lately freed from prison.’ Works The works of Reading, who in doctrinal terms was a strict Calvinist, include: * ‘A Grain of Incense, or Supplication for the Peace of Jerusalem, the Church and State,’ London [8 April], 1643. * ‘An Evening Sacrifice, or Prayer for a Family necessary for these calamitous Times,’ London, 1643. * ‘Brief Instructions concerning the holy Sacrament for their use who propose to receive the Lord's Supper,’ London, 1645. * ‘Little Benjamin, or Truth discovering Error; being a clear and full Answer unto the Letter subscribed by forty-seven Ministers of the Province of London, and presented to his Excellency, January 18, 1648 … by J.

During the 15th century, households working in the salt industry were exempted from taxes such as avariz, in return for their contributions to tuz resmi. In one case, an entire village involved in salt-production was exempted from the cizye, avariz-i divaniyye and tekalif-i örfiye taxes. An emin could play a key role in salt taxation; most of the surviving records of the emin stationed in Ragusa (who handled customs and tariffs on foreign trade) are receipts for salt duty. There were even dedicated salt-duty officers, who were granted the title tuz emini. Tuz resmi was usually arranged through the muqata'ah system; the government would grant a salt-producing resource to a contractor or tax- farmer, who would then be obliged to return a proportion of salt production (or the cash equivalent) to government coffers. There was usually a separate muqata'ah for each salt-mine. During the Tanzimat reforms, the Ottoman government took over complete control of salt production, and prices were fixed; in 1879, the salt industry was given to bankers as collateral against government borrowing, and then in 1881 it was made part of the Regie Company which gave all salt revenues to the Public Debt Commission - in an attempt to help pay off the Ottoman government's foreign debts. In the face of this government control of salt production (and of salt prices), smuggling became a problem. In the later 19th century, government revenue from tuz resmi was typically 70-80 million kurus per year; by 1912 revenue had risen to 130,476,788 kurus - much higher than other tariffs such as the muskirat resmi (spirits tax) or the damga resmi (stamp duty), although taxes on land and crops continued to return more revenue.

Flight 1 was a regularly scheduled TWA Sun Racer flight from Newark, New Jersey, to Los Angeles, California, with almost a dozen intermediate stops between. Approaching the flight's second stop, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania's Allegheny County Airport, pilot Otto Ferguson lost contact with the airport's radio navigation signal, and tracked several miles in a southwestern line off course. Fearing icing conditions, he descended in an attempt to find visual landmarks for navigation. Thick fog hindered him, and his descent continued until Flight 1 hit ice-covered trees atop Cheat Mountain, about south of Pittsburgh on the West Virginia line and near Uniontown, Pennsylvania. When the plane crashed it was aiming in a northern flight direction indicating that the pilot finally realized he had tracked south of his flightplan and may have been trying to correct it (the flight should have been aimed due west not north or hours prior south-southwest). The plane's two pilots were killed instantly, as were several passengers. Flight attendant Nellie Granger, though injured in the crash, got help for the surviving passengers by following nearby telephone wires to a home, where she called for help. Though one of the survivors later died of his injuries, Granger was hailed as a hero for her efforts to help them despite her own injuries.

In October 1930, T&WA; pioneered the first U.S. transcontinental scheduled service, a 36-hour affair that included an overnight stay in Kansas City, Missouri. As the airline became more experienced with long-distance flying, its service improved. In 1934, it introduced the Douglas DC-1, flying it coast to coast in February 1934 in a then-record 12 hours, 4 minutes. On May 18, 1934, the DC-2, the production version of the DC-1, entered commercial service on TWA's Columbus–Pittsburgh–Newark route. The aircraft's success quickly led to its introduction on most TWA routes, and the growth of others. The most prominent of these was the Sun Racer, also known as TWA Flight 1, which promised to deliver passengers from coast to coast in a single day.\\"Sun Racer\\", DC3airways.com.

Retrieved April 18, 2011. In Camden, pilot Otto Ferguson and co-pilot Harry C. Lewis received the weather report for their trip, which indicated heavy clouds and icing conditions in western Pennsylvania below 15,000 feet. The DC-2 was certified to operate in these conditions, which required instrument flying rules. Ferguson's plan was to fly west from Camden, using compass readings and radio beacons as guidance, then make an approach into Allegheny County Airport from the northeast. During the trip, he kept in radio contact with TWA Flight 21, a direct flight from Newark to Pittsburgh. That flight was scheduled to arrive about the same time as Flight 1, and Ferguson wanted to avoid potential problems. Unbeknownst to Ferguson, the course he flew was about 8 degrees south of his plan. After passing the Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, radio beam, TWA Flight 1 began to drift south. Heavy cloud cover prevented Ferguson from seeing any landmarks, and he was relying wholly upon instruments. Shortly after 10 a.m., Ferguson began his descent to Pittsburgh, believing it to be much closer than it actually was. At 10:09, he asked for weather conditions and was told the skies were overcast, with thick clouds above .

Investigators later concluded that during these final moments before the crash, Ferguson realized he was lost and began following a small creek to the northwest. The heavy clouds forced him to fly lower to follow the creek, which turns into a small valley before its source. After entering the valley, Ferguson would have had only three-quarters of a mile (1.5 kilometers) to climb over the mountain he was then faced with. About 10:20 a.m., Flight 1 crashed into the south side of Cheat Mountain's summit.

A handful of passengers were more fortunate, as they were thrown from the aircraft as it tore itself apart, then flipped over and began burning. Flight attendant Nellie Granger was the first of these passengers to realize what had happened. She remembered nothing of the crash itself and awoke about from the plane's wreckage. Though stunned by the concussion and bleeding from several injuries, she managed to pull two passengers away from the burning aircraft and administered first aid. Realizing they needed immediate medical attention, she went to find help.

Lewis, co-pilot  Investigation  Even before the survivors had been rushed to the hospital, investigators had begun to determine the reason for the crash. The Bureau of Air Commerce, predecessor to the modern Federal Aviation Administration, was put in charge of the investigation, but TWA sent independent investigators as well. Bad weather was pointed to as an early suspect, and TWA backed the idea that a faulty radio beacon was to blame,\\"TWA leans to view beam was faulty\\", The New York Times. April 9, 1936. Page 2. resuming an argument that had begun in February, when TWA's president testified to the U.S. Congress that airplane radio beacons were being poorly maintained. At the crash scene, investigators measured the plane's slide and found the DC-2 had cut a swath more than long, indicating the plane had been going at a fast pace rather than a landing speed. Interviews with Nellie Granger established the plane had not been readied for landing, indicating pilot Ferguson did not believe he was in a final descent. Government tests revealed the landing beam was not faulty, but TWA refused to accept those results and was persuaded only when independent testing confirmed the results. Major R. W. Schroeder of the Department of Commerce said, \\"In my opinion the cause of this catastrophe will never be known,\\" but investigators gradually uncovered the truth through interviews with people who had seen the plane's course diverge from schedule. In the end, the Bureau of Air Commerce concluded pilot Ferguson was at fault and demonstrated \\"poor judgment\\" by descending to a dangerous altitude in an attempt to navigate visually. By the time he realized his mistake, ice buildup on the plane's wings prevented it from gaining enough altitude to avoid the mountain.\\"Air pilot blamed in crash killing 12\\", The New York Times. September 3, 1936. Page 14. TWA disagreed with the report's conclusions but did not offer an alternative explanation.  Aftermath  In 1935, the Bureau of Air Commerce encouraged a group of airlines to establish the first three centers for providing air traffic control along the airways. Following the crash, the Bureau itself took over the centers and began to expand the network, leading to the development of the modern air traffic control system. For her efforts, flight attendant Nellie Granger from nearby Dravosburg, Pennsylvania was acclaimed as a hero.

Achuthan Nair is a steward to her house. Malootty Amma is quiet aged and she is unable to manage the household works by her own. She asks Nair to find a housemaid for her. She has a little caste bias, but the difficulty of getting a maid these days force her to accept anybody who is out of her caste. One day a poor girl, Kunjumalu with her grandma comes to ‘Kizhakkampattu’ Malootty Amma’s house. On their way they hear a beautiful humming which is later revealed as a musician’s near the temple. When they reach ‘Kizahkkampattu’ her grandma reveals to Malootty Amma that they are a different caste or family named ‘Veluthedathu’. The girl soon gets acquainted with the duties of the house and she gains the appeal of Malootty Amma. Kunjimalu, the maid befriends a girl named Ammini and they maintain a good friendship. Ammini has some mysterious problems which are not explained overtly. Anyway, she talks elaborately about her sister’s husband and their children at home. One day Haridasan returns home. He soon gets attracted with the housemaid Kunjimalu. One day he asks her to come to his room in night. She has an inner torment whether to follow the words of her employer (Haridas). But after she puts money in the holy steps of the temple and pray to show her a sign whether to follow his words by blooming the Blue Lotus of the pond, she decides to go to her room. And the two have a romantic and physical relationship. Kunjimalu prays to show the sign of Blue Lotus when she hears he is going to attend an interview. In all of these pleasant occasions a beautiful humming of the musician is heard, but he never appears. Haridas then gets a job in town. In a letter sent by Haridas after some days he coolly asks about the wellbeing of the family members and informs about his stay there. This letter is later read by Kunjimalu who is in bereavement after Haridas left. She is disappointed to find not a single word is written about her. But she consoles herself with the belief that Haridas will not be able to enquire about her since she is just a maid. Later plans for Haridas’ marriage go on. They find an alignment with Haridas’ cousin Ratnam. Kunjimalu is quiet worried and is sad but she goes on with her chores. After this she comes to know that the musician lost his sound from a man who sits under the banyan tree near the temple. Haridas later visits his cousin Ratnam’s house and stays a night there. That night, just like that is with Kunjimalu he tries to make Ratnam come to his room. But she rejects the idea telling that it will not be good for them to have physical relationship before the marriage. Their marriage takes place and Kunjimalu understands Haridasan was cheating her. On the first night Kunjimalu tells Ratnam things to take care in their (Haridasan’s and Ratnam’s) room including the creaking sound in one of the steps to his room. Ratnam becomes suspicious about Kunjimalu’s concern for him. She then finds some letters and notes written by Haridas and one of his photos in Kunjimalu’s belongings. She asks Kunjimalu to come with them to their rented house in town. Haridas who has a difficulty of meeting Kunjimalu after the marriage rejects his wife’s idea. She then questions her husband and she is now sure that her husband Haridas had relationship of all means with Kunjimalu. But surprisingly Ratnam is sympathetic toward Kunjimalu. Next day Malootty Amma asks Kunjimalu to leave her house. After that day they find she is not at house. They are a little worried now. News come to the house that a body has been found near the temple pond. Everyone worries that it will be Kunjimalu’s. Ratnam blames Haridas for what might have happened. Haridas goes to the spot and finds that it was not Kunjimalu’s body but her friend Ammini’s. He comes home. Next day they plan to leave house and Ratnam bid farewell Kunjimalu. In the end Kunjimalu is taken back home by her cousin who was going to marry her and who knows much of the story between Haridas and his cousin. On their way back, near the river they meet two people who ask them the way to ‘Padinjattu’ for sending the younger girl as a servant there. At this question Kunjimalu and her cousin look at each other. It is written on screen ‘End’ later ‘But there is no End’.

Lynch attended NUI Galway. Born in Quin, County Clare, Lynch first arrived on the inter-county scene playing at under-age level for Clare. He made his senior debut in the 2002 National Hurling League. Lynch went on to play a key part for Clare and won one All- Ireland medal. At club level Lynch is a Munster medallist in the intermediate grade with Clooney-Quin. He has also won one intermediate championship medal in Clare. Throughout his career Lynch made 24 championship appearances. His retirement came following the conclusion of the 2013 championship. He will be part of the Clare Hurling back-room team for 2014 as a forwards coach. Playing career =Club= Lynch started playing with Clooney-Quin's top team as a sixteen-year-old in 1999, however, it was 2006 before he enjoyed his first major success. On 22 October that year he won an intermediate championship medal following a two-point win over Killanena. Clooney-Quin subsequently represented Clare in the provincial club championship, eventually facing Bishopstown in the Munster decider. After twenty minutes Bishopstown led by four points; three minutes into the second-half they had stretched that to six and were hurling with supreme confidence. But they were made pay for twelve wides while their opponents were much more ruthless in front of the posts. A 0-14 to 1-8 victory gave Lynch a Munster medal. =Inter-county= Lynch made his senior debut with Clare during the 2002 National Hurling League. He remained on and off the team for a number of years, before making his championship debut in an All-Ireland semi-final defeat by Cork on 14 August 2005. On 13 July 2008 Lynch lined out in his first Munster final, when he came on as a substitute for Declan O'Rourke against Tipperary. Clare were punished for a sluggish first half on that occasion, and were eventually defeated by 2-21 to 0-19. On 8 September 2013 Lynch lined out against Cork in his first All-Ireland final when he was introduced as a late substitute once again. Three second-half goals through Conor Lehane, Anthony Nash and Pa Cronin, and a tenth point of the game from Patrick Horgan gave Cork a one- point lead as injury time came to an end. A last-gasp point from corner-back Domhnall O'Donovan earned Clare a 0-25 to 3-16 draw. The replay on 28 September was regarded as one of the best in recent years. Clare's Shane O'Donnell, who Lynch replaced as a brief blood sub, was a late addition to the team, and went on to score a hat-trick of goals in the first nineteen minutes of the game. Patrick Horgan top scored for Cork again, however, further goals from Conor McGrath and Darach Honan secured a 5-16 to 3-16 victory for Clare.

She is currently contracted with the Adelaide Thunderbirds playing in the Suncorp Super Netball competition in Australia. She is predominately a wing attack, but can also play goal attack. Domestic career Pitman's career began in New South Wales, representing the state at underage national championships before moving to the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra where she was noticed by national head coach Norma Plummer. In 2010, she was signed by New Zealand ANZ Championship franchise the Canterbury Tactix. However, in round 6 against the Northern Mystics, she suffered an ACL injury that ended her season. After a successful ACL rehabilitation, she joined the Queensland Firebirds in 2011. Significant improvement throughout the season resulted in Pitman becoming the starting wing attack and helping the Firebirds win the ANZ Championship in an undefeated season. Her breakthrough season was capped off with selection in the Australian Netball Diamonds team for the 2011 World Netball Championships in Singapore, where Australia retained the title. In 2013, Pitman was part of the Firebirds team who made it to the ANZ Championship Grand Final for the second time in 3 years where they were defeated by the Adelaide Thunderbirds 50-48. At the conclusion of the season, she and Firebirds teammate Natalie Medhurst, announced that they had signed with the West Coast Fever for the 2014 season. Towards the end of the 2014, Pitman announced that she would take the following season (2015) off from the ANZ Championship to consider her netball future. In July 2014, she signed a one-year contract with Netball Superleague side Manchester Thunder for the 2015 season in England. For the 2016 season, she returned to play in the ANZ Championship, signing for New Zealand side Central Pulse. After the dissolution of the ANZ Championship in July 2016, Pitman signed with the Adelaide Thunderbirds for the 2017 Suncorp Super Netball season. Pitman starred for the Thunderbirds during their 2017 campaign and was ultimately named the 2017 Club Champion after a highly successful season. Pitman has been a co-captain of the Thunderbirds since 2019, sharing the role initially with English international teammate Layla Guscoth and later sharing it with Australian team-mate Hannah Petty. International career Pitman made her international debut against the Silver Ferns during a series of international matches prior to the 2011 World Netball Championships in Singapore. During the world championships, she featured regularly at wing attack in her first major international tournament. In the gold medal match against New Zealand, she was brought onto wing attack at half time when the Diamonds were six goals down and helped the Diamonds draw level at the end of regulation time to send the game into extra time. The Diamonds went onto win the match 58-57 and claim the world championship with Pitman playing a major role in the Diamond's comeback. She represented the Australian Netball Diamonds throughout 2012 during the Quad Series against South Africa, New Zealand and England. However, she was unable to make a return to the national squad after this series. In 2017 Pitman was selected into the England National Netball Team through her Yorkshire-born father. She later made her international debut for England against South Africa in the 2017 January Quad Series, and helped them claim two historic wins over the New Zealand Silver Ferns in 2017. She was part of the England team which won the Gold Medal at the 2018 Commonwealth Games, defeating Australia in the final which was an historic moment for netball in England. In 2019, Pitman was selected in the England National Netball Team for the 2019 Netball World Cup where the team won the Bronze Medal.

They are native to the Oju and Obi local government areas of Nigeria, where 2006 population figures stand at an estimated 267,198 people. However, many Igede people are dispersed across the state and the Nation. For instance, the Igede language is also spoken in Nigeria's Cross River State, and many Igede communities exist in Osun State and Ogun State. The Igede language is a member of the Benue-Congo subgroup of the Niger-Congo language family. Geographical location The Oju Local Government Area was created in 1976 and shares boundaries with present-day Obi, Ado, Konshisha and Gwer East Local Government Areas of Benue State, Ebonyi and Izzi Local Government Areas of Ebonyi State, and Yala Local Government Area of Cross River State. It is headquartered in Oju Town. The Obi Local Government Area was created in 1996 and has its headquarters at Obarike-Ito. The local government area derives its name from the Obi stream that flows in the area and shares boundary with Ado, Otukpo and Oju local government areas of Benue State. History =Origin: Oral tradition = The Igede trace their origin to Sabon Gida Ora in present-day Edo state. They are said to be the descendants of Agba, a high chief in Sabon Gida Ora. A skirmish between the Igede and the natives of Ora led to their migration from that region to present-day Benue state through Nsukka in Enugu state. This historical event in Igede history is commonly recounted in song and drama, for instance the record and drama piece \\"Ego ny'Igede\\". = Origin: Archival records = Archival records portray them as migrants from Ogoja province who have increasingly adopted the culture and practices of the Idoma.

It was typically a fixed fee, a divani tax; it was paid around the time of marriage, to the timar-holder, or even to a tax-farmer in their stead. The tax-collector might record details of individual marriages, although this was not equivalent to the church marriage-registers in contemporary western Europe and some of the tax records are unclear. Resm-i arusane is first recorded in the fifteenth century AD. Although it was arguably incompatible with the shari'ah law, the resm-i arusane continued to be a small, but significant, source of tax revenue in the Ottoman Empire. For instance, tax records for the village of Sakal Dutan in 1550 show a total 810 akçes of tax revenue, of which 30 akçe were from resm-i arusane. One 16th-century fatwa specifically stated that the resm-i arusane and the resm-i hinzir (pig tax) were illegal, but these taxes on \\"forbidden\\" transactions continued - sometimes under the guise of \\"gifts\\". Various sources suggest that the fee was paid either by the bride or the husband; rates might vary according to the bride's personal status and religion. One preserved document sets resm-i arusane at double the rate for virgins compared to widows; and Muslim rates paid twice as much as unbelievers. The kannunname of Rhodos and Cos, in 1650, set resm-i arusane at 30 aspers for widows (regardless of their religion), and 60 aspers for virgins. A Christian couple who wished to marry in a church would also have to pay nikâh resmi to the metropolitan, and a further fee to the local parish priest; this could be considerably more expensive than the resm-i arusane itself. There would also be a charge for registering the marriage with the government.

It is the standard hand pump in Zimbabwe, and is used in Zimbabwe and Namibia. There are approximately 40 000 pumps (2009) in Zimbabwe, and annually about 3000 pumps are installed. History The original version was designed in 1933 as a closed-top cylinder pump. Around 1960 the design was modernized. The base of the well was from then on bolted to the well casing. It was at this point the pump got its current name, and this design became the national standard for hand pumps in Zimbabwe. After Zimbabwe’s independence in 1980, the government created its own modernized version of the pump, B-type Zimbabwe Bush Pump. The new pump integrated the features from the earlier pumps. This is the current standard (2009). The pump is today regarded by many as a national treasure, and was in 1997 pictured on its own postal stamp. Technical description As other positive displacement pumps the Bush Pump is constructed around a down-hole cylinder containing a piston, that lifts water with every lever stroke. The pump's signifying feature is the hardwood block that acts as a bearing and its lever mechanism. Besides this, the pump has an untraditional construction where the well base is bolted directly to the top of the well casing, sticking out of the bore hole. It extracts water from a depth up of 18 to 100m, and can support a usage up to 250 people. Installation and maintenance The bush pump is easy and inexpensive to build, modify and maintain; still the pump has to be installed by experienced mechanics. Lifting tackles and other special equipment is used to install the component that are inserted into the bore hole. The installation is mostly done by the government of Zimbabwe and different NGOs. The pump is maintained through a system consisting of three levels of responsibility: 1. At the direct user level, a committee and a caretaker is chosen by the users. They are responsible for minor functional maintenance, for instance oiling the pump and tightening bolts. 2. At the ward level there is a trained pump mechanic who repairs broken pumps, and keeps maintenance records. 3. At the district level a water supply operative is in charge of larger maintenance operations, and has access to vehicles and equipment for transporting larger pump components. Analysis The bush pump has been the subject of scholarly studies. In their article, “The Zimbabwe Bush Pump: Mechanics of a Fluid Technology\\", Marianne de Laet and Annemarie Mol analyze the pumps role as an appropriate technology. They focus on the fluidity of the pump, meaning its flexibility both when it comes to how it was invented, how it is used, and what function it has. They make their case by showing that the pump was not invented by one human actor (the opposite of what they call heroic actorship), but through a slow process of fluid actorship, where there is not one clear human creator. The use of the pump is also fluid, it does not only give water to a community, but the construction of the pump can serve an important ceremonial function both locally and nationally. The pump can also be said to be fluid in how it reacts to decay. Even if seemingly essential parts of it mechanics is broken; it can serve functions not intended by any of its creators. The pump is not only its physical appearance or its technical description, Laet and Mol argues: :The first aspect of the pump’s fluidity is that its boundaries are not solid and sharp. The Pump is a mechanical object, it is a hydraulic system, but it is also a device installed by the community, a health promoter and a nation-building apparatus. It has each of these identities – and each comes with its own different boundaries. ... In each of its identities the Bush Pump contains a variant of its environment. Laet and Mol argue that their way of analyzing the bush pump can be helpful when trying to understand a wide variety of objects and practices.

There are ten suspected victims, all African-American women, and the remains of eight have been recovered. Officers suspect that Antwan Maurice Pittman, a registered sex offender charged with a murder fitting a similar profile, was responsible for the Edgecombe deaths. All of the victims had a history of drugs and/or sex work. History In June 2008, the sheriff's office requested assistance from the State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) and formed a task force of local, state and federal officials to try to find out if the killings are connected. In 2010, the remains of Roberta Williams, missing since 2008, were discovered off Seven Bridges Road between Battleboro and Whitakers, North Carolina. In January 2011, a hunter found more human remains in Edgecombe County. The remains were 37-year-old Yolanda Lancaster, who was listed as missing. In September 2009, a suspect, Antwan Maurice Pittman, a registered sex offender, was charged with at least one of the cases, Taraha Shenice Nicholson, 28, who was found strangled. Authorities are still questioning whether Pittman may have been connected to some of the other killings. The first victim found was Melody Wiggins, 29, back in 2005. In 2007, Jackie Thorpe, 35, was found nude in a pile of trash. In 2008, the body of Ernestine Battle, 50, was found in a wooded area. In June 2009, a farmer found the skeleton of Jarniece Latonya Hargrove, 31, also in a wooded spot. Conviction of Antwan Pittman On September 28, 2011, a jury convicted Antwan Pittman of first-degree murder of one of the women, 28-year-old Taraha Nicholson. Although he has never been charged in relation to the deaths of any of the other alleged victims of the Edgecombe County serial killer, authorities have stated that Pittman is a suspect in at least seven of the other cases. Public awareness In July 2012, a motorcycle ride was held in contribution to the five women found murdered. The ride was organized to help raise awareness for the nine women found dead who are suspected to be victims of the Edgecombe killer.

The modest Jewish community in Sardinia consisted of Sephardic Jews of Spanish and Italian descent. Early history The first recorded mention of Jews in Sardinia occurred in the year 19, during the reign of Roman emperor Tiberius. 4000 Jews were exiled from Rome to Sardinia. Little recorded Jewish history of early Sardinia remains but it is presumed they led a quiet, provincial life with full rights along with the natives. They even left a mark on Sardinian itself in words like Friday that, unlike the other Romance languages, is actually chenàpura or cenàpura, deriving its name from the Latin cena pura in order to designate the food prepared for Shabbat eve.Sa limba sarda (article written in Italian) When Christianity became the state religion of Rome, Jewish rights everywhere, including Sardinia, became curtailed. After the fall of Rome, a succession of foreign rulers became the governors of Sardinia and life for the Jews became increasingly harsh. Sardinia is one of the few places in Italy where there are catacombs containing Jewish inscriptions. The catacombs of Sant'Antioco date from the 4th and 5th centuries. The inscriptions are in a form of Hebrew- Latin, a language closely related to Italki. Medieval history In 1325, Sardinia fell under the rule of the Spanish Kingdom of Aragon. For the first century during Spanish rule, life was more or less pleasant for Sardinian Jews. During this time Spanish Jews began to arrive and settle the island. The Jewish inhabitants of Marseille fleeing violence 1484 and again in 1485, and leading to an exodus of Jews from the city, settled in Sardinia which became home to about 200 Jewish families from Marseille Also, in 1485, the Jews of Sardinia were declared property of the King of Aragon and were governed by his authority alone. Many Jewish families lived the Sardinian capitol of Cagliari where there was a large synagogue. This synagogue was eventually forcibly converted into the Roman Catholic Church of Santa Croce The largest Jewish community in Sardinia was located in the city of Alghero. Many Jewish families were engaged in trade and other respected professions such as banking and medicine. While life was good for the Jews in Alghero, the Jews living in other Sardinian cities endured increasing intolorence. This included the establishment of Jewish ghettos and special identifying clothing as well as forced baptism. Jewish immigration to Sardinia was halted under pain of death. A decree issued in 1481 fixed the penalties for an offense against Christianity and for the employment of Christian servants. In 1492, the Spanish crown with the Alhambra Decree ordered the expulsion of Jews in Spain. Later that year the Jews of Sardinia and CorsicaCowans, J. Early Modern Spain: A Documentary History. 2003 were also ordered to leave. Many Sardinian Jews arrived in Malta, Greece, and Calabria, Italy, which became a temporary home for other Sephardic refugees as well. Sardinia is also mentioned in the Inquisition records pertaining to a population of Marranos. Later history During the 19th century a modest number of Jewish families from Italy settled back on the island. Sardinian Jews were emancipated on March 29, 1848. In the years that followed, 180 Jews joined the Sardinian army. The Prime minister of Sardinia became embroiled in the Edgardo Mortara affair. A secret plot was hatched to kidnap the boy and bring him secretly to Sardinia. By Italian law regulating Jewish communal organization in 1931, Sardinian Jews were under the jurisdiction of the Jewish community in Rome. Most of the Sardinian Jews were murdered during the Holocaust. After World War II and the establishment of the state of Israel the last surviving Jews of Sardinia never returned to the island. Today there is no organized Jewish life in Sardinia. There is no trace of the former Marrano population as well.

History According to an early Baroque project of Christoph Dientzenhofer, the house was rebuilt in the 16th century, as all the neighbouring houses were after the fire of 1541. In 1601 it was bought by Kašpar Kaplíř of Sulevice, who was executed on the Old Town Square. The house acquired its Baroque shape during 1705–1727, when it was owned by a famous baroque architect, Jan Blažej Santini-Aichel. However, when Santini died, a renowned goldsmith bought the house and built up the third floor. This town house served its tenants until 2002, when it was closed.

It is administered under South Coast Railway zone. In 2017, as part of Swachh Rail campaign, the Quality Council of India declared Visakhapatnam as the cleanest railway station in the country. The station is a major stop on the Howrah–Chennai main line. The city's railway station was originally called Waltair railway station. In around 1987, Mr. D. V. Subbarao, the then mayor of Visakhapatnam, changed the name to Visakhapatnam which is the largest railway station under then east coast railway and A1 category station . Visakhapatnam railway station is administered by the South Coast Railway of Indian Railways which is headquartered in Visakhapatnam and the same was announced on Feb 27 2019 by union railway minister Piyush Goyal.  Overview  The station is a terminal station; trains must go back the same way as they come. With many trains arriving at the same time platforms are not always available. In case any train is late, the other trains are stopped at Duvvada or Vizianagaram. The Route Relay Interlocking (RRI) system, an arrangement of signal apparatus that prevents conflicting movements through an arrangement of tracks such as junctions or crossings, is reported to be one of the major causes for these trains being delayed after Duvvada Station. Over 5,000 people travel between Visakhapatnam and Secunderabad every day. To clear the rush, there are over 18 trains connecting Visakhapatnam and Secunderabad. The Godavari Express, one of the most prestigious trains of the South Central Railway is considered the best way between the cities. However, the rush for the train is too high, that tickets have to be booked before two months from the journey. It was one of the busiest stations when it was part of East Coast Railway zone. On average, every train has a minimum halt period of 20 minutes.  History  During 1893–1896, the long tracks covering the entire coastal stretch from Cuttack to Vijayawada, was built and opened to traffic by Bengal Nagpur Railway which was later renamed as South Eastern Railway.Bengal Nagpur Railway’s line to Cuttack was opened on 1 January 1899. The long northern portion of the East Coast line to Cuttack, including the branch line to Puri, was taken over by Bengal Nagpur Railway in 1902. The southern part was subsequently merged with Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway. East Coast Railway zone of Indian Railways came into existence in its present form with effect from 1 April 2003. The geographical jurisdiction of the railway is however extended over three states encompassing almost all parts of Orissa along with parts of Srikakulam, Vizainagaram and Visakhapatnam districts of North Eastern Andhra Pradesh, and Bastar and Dantewada districts of Chhattisgarh State. As such, these regions with a long coastal line are rich in mineral and other natural resources, and are on the threshold of an industrial upsurge.  Structure and amenities  The station is spread over an area of , maintained by 222 employees. The station has 08 platforms and all the tracks are broad gauge and electrified. Almost all platforms are in same size. The station has East and West terminals equipped with reservation counters and has Inter Model Transport Facility for Bus Station.

Plot  A widowed mother of a young girl, Annie Benchley (Jennie Garth) has been unhappy since her husband - Annie's childhood sweetheart - died of leukemia when her daughter Taylor (Dannika Northcott) was only three years old. She has since been struggling to support herself and her daughter while working as a waitress at a diner. When working, her mother Carol (Marilu Henner) looks after Taylor. Carol feels that Annie should start dating again and constantly tries to set her up with a plastic surgeon, Jeffrey (Todd Babcock), whom Annie does not like. One day, Annie accidentally hits the car of Eddie Avedon (Ethan Erickson), an arrogant and jaded actor who is already late for an appointment. Both parties blame each other for the car accident, and Annie is finally able to steal Eddie's license and registration to make sure that he will pay for her damage. Eddie leaves immediately, and is later arrested for speeding without a license. Annie is phoned to bail him out, which she reluctantly does, on condition that Eddie will pay for her car to be repaired. When Jeffrey bothers her yet again, Annie calls Eddie and blackmails him into running by, threatening to press charges against him if he does not. Eddie stops by, and gets acquaintanted with Taylor, the biggest fan of a children's show in which Eddie happens to portray Mulligan, a rabbit in a costume. Eddie, wanting to star in big blockbuster films like his brother Scott (Zack Ward), detests his job, until Taylor makes him realize that he touches children's lives with his role. Grateful, he invites Taylor to meet first Mulligan, and then his spoiled co-star Kenny (Adam Karelin). Over time, Eddie grows closer to both Annie and Taylor, and is desperate to help Taylor out with an operation that could restore her current bad sight. Annie reluctantly allows him to arrange a doctor meeting, though fearing that the operation will not succeed, thus giving Taylor false hope. Eddie is more optimistic, however, and even raises a large amount of money to pay for her operation. Bad luck strikes again when Eddie is informed that the scheduled operation will take place in three to five years. Not wanting to disappoint Annie and Taylor, he tells them that the operation will be in a few weeks, and meanwhile begs with his manager Dick Brocton (Fred Willard) for a big loan to push forward the operation. Annie is outraged when she finds out the truth about the operation date through a letter, and breaks contact with Eddie. She is unaware, though, that Eddie has arranged for the operation to take place within a week by selling his house and car. Eventually, Taylor's sight is successfully restored and Annie reconciles with Eddie. Two years later, Eddie is a successful movie star and is the father of Annie's second child.

In addition to its function as a junction station it also serves the towns of Hüttlingen and Buch in the municipality of Rainau, both about two kilometres away. The station was named after the nearby farmhouse of Goldshöfe, which today is part of the Aalen district of Hofen. History  The station was opened on 3 October 1863 with the line to Nördlingen was opened as part of the Rems Railway (Remsbahn). A connection to Crailsheim was being planned at that time and the station was designed from its beginning as a junction station. The line to Crailsheim (the Upper Jagst Railway) went into operation in 1866, which subsequently became the more important of the two lines, as part of the main line between Stuttgart and Nuremberg. Nevertheless, in 1972 the line to Nordlinger was electrified as an alternative route for traffic between Stuttgart and Munich to the line via Ulm for the Olympic Games in Munich. The Crailsheim line was electrified in 1985. Infrastructure Sign to \\"Rems\\" and \\"Jagst\\" platforms The station building, which is T-shaped, is typical of stations built in Württemberg at the time and is built between the two lines that separate the front of the station. Each of the two sections has two platform tracks. Later both the line to Nördlingen and the line to Crailsheim are single-track, while the line from Aalen has two tracks. The platform tracks of both lines are numbered 1 and 2, and are distinguished by the prefix of \\"Jagst\\" or \\"Rems\\". In the timetable the prefixes are abbreviated to \\"J\\" and \\"R”. The tracks are crossed via planks crossings on the level rather than by subways. The \\"Rems 1\\" track is now closed. Until 1985 there was a rail connection from the \\"Rems\\" parts of station to the Upper Jagst Railway, which was built when the local freight yard was established. The goods shed still exists, but in the meantime it has lost its function. Operations  Signal box 2 (east) The station is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 5 station. Its main purpose is as a junction station. It is also used for turning, parking and maintaining trains serving the nearby Aalen station. Goldshöfe is served by Regionalbahn services to Donauwörth and Regional-Express services on the line to Crailsheim, with the regular interval timetable providing good interchange opportunities. The InterCity services between Karlsruhe and Nuremberg run through without stopping. The station has a bus stop, a park-and-ride facility and a covered bicycle stand.

At the urging of Oliver, Susan visits Dr. Andrew, who tapes a hypnosis session with her in his office. Initially she reverts to a childlike state before becoming possessed by the demonic entity. Andrews ends the session prematurely, and Susan reverts to her normal self. Disturbed, Andrews consults his colleague, Dr. Logan. The following morning, Susan kills another landscaper sent to her house. That night, Oliver returns home and finds blood smeared on the kitchen telephone. He attempts to confront Susan, but she says she is tired and they will have to talk in the morning. Meanwhile, Andrews and Logan begin researching demonic possession, convinced that Susan's problem is supernatural and beyond the help of medicine. After analyzing a journal kept by Susan's grandfather, Andrew informs Oliver that the Nomed family is subject to a curse in which firstborn daughters fall prey to a demon. Susan visits a shopping mall alone, and steals an abstract painting from an art gallery. When the gallery owner confronts her, she causes him to levitate over an atrium before he falls multiple stories, and his body is impaled on a sculpture below. Andrews retrieves a crown of thorns from the Nomed family mausoleum, which, according to Susan's grandfather's journal, will expel the demon. Simultaneously Susan transforms into a fully formed demonic state at home, and brutally kills Oliver. Andrews arrives shortly after and manages to crown Susan, banishing the demon to the mausoleum. Andrews brings Susan to the mausoleum, and she cries as the demon returns to its tomb. Before they depart, Andrews instructs a gravekeeper to keep the mausoleum sealed from the public. As they drive away, the gravekeeper laughs maniacally. It turns out the gravekeeper is actually Ben, the landscaper from earlier in the film.

He is best known for his appearances with All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW) under the ring names Jim Steele and Wolf Hawkfield.  Professional wrestling career  =Early career (1991–1993)= Rocha began his career in Florida for International Championship Wrestling Alliance in October 1991. He would also wrestle for the United States Wrestling Association (USWA) in Tennessee between February and March 1992. =World Championship Wrestling (1993–1994)= Rocha trained in the WCW Power Plant and turned pro in late 1993 where he used the name \\"Jungle\\" Jim Steele. Steele worked for WCW for the next year but was not pushed. He left the promotion in 1994. = Extreme Championship Wrestling (1995) = Steele appeared in ECW at Barbed Wire, Hoodies & Chokeslams in June 1995 to face 911. =All Japan Pro Wrestling (1994–2002)= Steele debuted in All Japan Pro Wrestling in late 1994, where he continued to wrestle as Jim Steele. In late 1994, Steele entered the 1994 World's Strongest Tag Determination League tournament, forming a team with Dan Spivey but the team finished in last place with 2 points. In 1995, Steele was given a new name: Lacrosse but the new name did little for his All Japan career as he spent the next 2 years having little to no direction as he received only 1 title shot at the All Asia Tag Team Championship and was left off tournaments. In early 1997, Steele helped form the Triangle of Power with \\"Dr. Death\\" Steve Williams and Gary Albright, however it did little for his career. In late 1997, Steele left the Triangle of Power and was given another gimmick becoming Wolf Hawkfield, a gimmick based on the Wolf Hawkfield character from the Virtua Fighter video game series. The character proved to be successful as Steele's stock rose. He formed a team with Johnny Smith and the two entered the 1997 World's Strongest Tag Determination League where they finished in 5th place with 10 points. On January 9, 1998, Hawkfield and Smith defeated Jun Akiyama and Takao Omori to win the All Asia Tag Team Championship. In the spring, Hawkfield then entered the 1998 Champion Carnival but finished in 12th place with 4 points. On October 6, Hawkfield and Smith lost the All Asia Tag Team Championship to Tamon Honda and Jun Izumida. Following the title loss, Hawkfield's stock once again dropped as he wasn't used for either the 1998 World's Strongest Tag Determination League and the 1999 Champion Carnival and he also received no title shots in 1999. Hawkfield returned to an All Japan tournament by entering the 1999 World's Strongest Tag Determination League teaming with Gary Albright but they finished in 7th place with 2 points. In early 2000, Hawkfield entered the 2000 Champion Carnival, but lost in the first round to Jun Izumida. In the summer of 2000, Mitsuharu Misawa left All Japan and went on to form Pro Wrestling NOAH. Misawa would ultimately take the majority of the native roster and a few foreigners with him. Hawkfield, along with the majority of the gaijin side, remained in All Japan. Following the exodus, Hawkfield reverted to Jim Steele and formed a new tag team with Mike Barton. The new team entered the 2000 World's Strongest Tag Determination League where they finished in 4th place with 10 points. In 2001, Steele entered the 2001 Champion Carnival where he finished 8th place with 2 points. For the rest of 2001, Steele would continue to team with Barton, in the fall of 2001, the two joined the All Japan Branch of Masahiro Chono's stable: Team 2000. In late 2001, Steele and Barton entered the 2001 G1 Tag League where they became the runners-up, losing to Tencozy in the finals. In 2002, Steele would have a busy year as he and Barton challenged for the World Tag Team Championship on two occasions but came up short each time. In the spring, Steele entered the 2002 Champion Carnival finishing in 3rd place with 6 points. In the summer, Steele and Barton won the Stan Hansen Cup in a four-way tag team match. By the end of 2002, Steele and Barton left All Japan and signed with New Japan Pro Wrestling. =New Japan Pro Wrestling (2002–2004)= Steele and Barton entered New Japan in the fall of 2002. They entered the 2002 Triathlon Tournament teaming with Yuji Nagata. They made it to the finals but lost to Manabu Nakanishi, Osamu Nishimura, and Yutaka Yoshie. In February 2003, Steele and Barton entered a #1 Contenders Tournament for the IWGP Tag Team Championship which they emerged victorious defeating Makai Club members: Tadao Yasuda and Kazunari Murakami, unfortunately the title match would be delayed when Steele suffered a leg injury putting him out for months. After recovering from his injury, Steele returned in the fall of 2003 as he teamed with Barton in the 2003 G1 Tag League. During the tag league, Steele and Barton would receive their IWGP Tag Team Title shot against champions: Hiroshi Tanahashi and Yutaka Yoshie, but they lost. In the tag league, Steele and Barton finished in 6th place with 6 points. After a few more months in New Japan, Steele and Barton left in early 2004. =All Japan Pro Wrestling (2004)= In late 2004, Steele returned to All Japan now using the gimmick Love Machine Steele. Steele teamed with the GREAT MUTA in the 2004 World's Strongest Tag Determination League but the team finished 4th place in their block with 4 points. After the tournament, Steele left All Japan again. =World Wrestling Council (2005–2008)= During his time in Japan, Steele competed for the World Wrestling Council promotion in Puerto Rico. In November 2001, Steele won the WWC Puerto Rican Championship, but lost the title three weeks later. Steele worked for WWC on and off until 2008, in which he retired shortly thereafter.

The species is a leaf-mimic katydid; when it is in repose its camouflage resembles a diseased or dead leaf. The katydid owes both its common name and its specific epithet (ocellata, meaning \\"marked with little eyes\\") to its startle display, in which it shows false eye spots on its normally hidden hind wings. Characteristics The adult Pterochroza ocellata is about 45mm to 65mm in length. In its protective camouflage it resembles a dried leaf. If in spite of its camouflage it is threatened, the katydid exposes its hind wings, displaying two conspicuous eye spots.Naskrecki, Piotr (2013). \\"The Beautiful Katydid,\\" The Beautiful Katydid, N.p. No two individual Pterochroza ocellata are identical in their color pattern or the shape of the wings; this reduces the risk that predators could learn to recognize a fixed visual pattern. As in all katydids, their organs of hearing, or tympana, are on their front legs just below the joint between the femur and the tibia. The antennae are long, even for Tettigoniidae, being two to three times the length of the body. Habitats Pterochroza ocellata was described by Carl Linnaeus in the 18th century. In tropical regions such as northern South America, monkeys are among its major predators, actively searching for katydids by sorting through leaf litter. Eating habits The diet of Pterochroza ocellata includes plant and animal detritus, as well as fresh leaves. It is not a predator.Naskrecki, Piotr (2013). \\"The Smaller Majority by Piotr Naskrecki.\\" The Smaller Majority by Piotr Naskrecki, N.p. Reproductive behavior As in most Tettigoniidae, the male attracts females with a high-pitched call, which it produces by rubbing one fore-wing over a scraper on the other fore-wing.Sinha, Ankur (2013). \\"Save Our Green,\\" Save Our Green, N.p. This sound has been suggested to double as interference for the echolocation of bats, one of its many natural predators. When a female appears, the katydids first inspect each other with their antennae, then shake their bodies to gauge each other's size and strength. If the male does not retreat, the female will approach and they couple. Coupling lasts a few hours, during which the male will produce the spermatophylax and attaches it to the female's ovipositor. The spermatophylax is a gelatinous structure that contains the male's sperm cells as well as nutrients in the form of carbohydrates and proteins as a contribution towards the survival of the female and the offspring. The male's investment in the spermatophylax is considerable; it may exceed more than 20% of his body mass. The couple then separate and the female doubles over and consumes the spermatophylax.Naskrecki, Piotr (2013). \\"The Beautiful Katydid,\\" The Beautiful Katydid, N.p.

TsNIIMash () is a Russian rocket and spacecraft scientific center, dealing with all phases of development from conceptual design to flight test. It specializes in the development of long range ballistic missiles, air defense missiles, and propulsion units the defense industry. It was established in 1946. The name TsNIIMash is an initialism for Central Research Institute of Machine Building (). History Originally called NII-88 (Scientific-Research Institute No.88), the entity was established on May 13, 1946, located at what was then called Kaliningrad, Moscow Oblast (now Korolyov), northeast of Moscow. Based on his Plant No. 88, Dmitriy Ustinov had successfully lobbied to control post- war research and development of rockets in late 1945. Impressed by his work in Germany on the analysis of the V-2, Ustinov appointed Sergey Korolev chief designer of section 3 on long-range missiles, later called OKB-1. In 1956, OKB-1 was removed from NII-88 to become an independent bureau. Helmut Gröttrup headed a group of German scientists working for the Soviets at Branch 1 of NII-88 located on Gorodomlya Island. Their job was to help reconstruct a Russian Version of the V-2, called the R-1, after which they were returned to Germany. The facility was also spied on by American U-2 spy planes in the late 1950s. It was renamed Central Research Institute of Machine Building in 1967. Activities TsNIIMash performs the following activities: * Fundamental scientific and system research to prepare the basic strategy for spacecraft and rocket technology development.http://inspirehep.net/search?ln=en&p;=TsNIIMash&of;=hb&action;_search=Search&sf;=earliestdate&so;=d * Theoretical calculations and experimental research on aeronautical and gas dynamic loads in the atmosphere of the Earth and other planets, and in outer space. * Analysis of the thermal resistance of thermal shields in high- temperature gas flows. * Theoretical calculations and experimental qualification of designs under the influence of static, dynamic, shock, and thermal loads. * Ground control of spacecraft, as well as research and development of new methods and algorithms for guidance, ballistics and navigation. * Development of methods and instruments for mission control during orbital insertion, attitude re-orientation, stabilization, orbital maneuvering, re-entry and landing. * Reliability aspects of spacecraft and rocket engineering. * Standardization and harmonization of spacecraft and rocket engineering products, as well as certification and quality control. * Introduction of space technology in the national economy.

In Indochina, leopards are rare outside protected areas and threatened by habitat loss due to deforestation as well as poaching for the illegal wildlife trade. The population trend is suspected to be decreasing. As of 2016, the population is thought to comprise 973–2,503 mature individuals, with only 409–1,051 breeding adults. The historical range has decreased by more than 90%.  Taxonomy  Panthera pardus delacouri was described in 1930 by Pocock based on a leopard skin from Annam.  Characteristics  Skull of an Indochinese leopard at Museum Wiesbaden Pocock described an Indochinese leopard skin as almost rusty- red in ground colour but paler at the sides. It had small rosettes that were mostly in diameter and so closely set that it looked dark. The fur was short with less than long hair on the back. He commented to have seen only black leopards from Johor and other areas in the Malay Peninsula exhibited in menageries. He therefore assumed that the proportion of black leopards increases farther south. Records from camera trapping studies conducted at 22 locations in southern Thailand and peninsular Malaysia between 1996 and 2009 show that Indochinese leopards recorded north of the Kra Isthmus are predominantly spotted. South of the Isthmus, only melanistic leopards were recorded. Melanism is quite common in dense tropical forest habitat, and black leopards are thought to have a selective advantage for ambush.  Distribution and habitat  The Indochinese leopard is distributed in Southeast Asia, where today small populations remain only in Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, Cambodia, and southern China. In Laos, Vietnam and Singapore it is suspected to have been extirpated. Peninsular Malaysia and the Northern Tenasserim Forest Complex on the Thailand-Myanmar border are at present considered strongholds, and eastern Cambodia a priority site. In Myanmar's Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary, the leopard population declined so drastically between the 1940s and 1980s, that by 2000 it was estimated as being close to locally extinct. In 2015, leopards were recorded for the first time by camera traps in the hill forests of Karen State. In Thailand, the Indochinese leopard is present in the Western Forest Complex, Kaeng Krachan-Kui Buri and Khlong Saeng-Khao Sok protected area complexes. But since the turn of the 21st century, it has not been recorded any more in the northern and south-central forest complexes of the country. In Hala Bala Wildlife Sanctuary on the Thai-Malaysian border, only two leopards walked past camera traps deployed between October 2004 and October 2007. In Malaysia, the leopard is present in Belum-Temengor, Taman Negara and Endau-Rompin National Parks. In April 2010, a spotted leopard was camera trapped in Taman Negara National Park, where previously only black leopards were thought to occur. It has also been recorded in secondary forests in Selangor and Johor states. In Laos, 25 different leopards walked past camera traps set up over an area of in the Nam Et-Phou Louey National Biodiversity Conservation Area between April 2003 and June 2004. Leopards are reported to occur in Nam Kan National Protected Area as well. In Cambodia, leopards were recorded in deciduous dipterocarp forest in Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary between December 2008 and August 2009, and in Sre Pok Wildlife Sanctuary in 2009 and 2014. In southern China, camera trap surveys were conducted in 11 nature reserves between 2002 and 2009, but leopards were only recorded in Changqing National Nature Reserve in the Qinling Mountains.  Ecology and behaviour  Since the mid-1980s, leopard-oriented field research was carried out in three protected areas in Thailand: *Between 1985 and 1986, leopard scats were collected in an evergreen dipterocarp mountain forest in Chiang Mai Province of northwestern Thailand. Prey species found in scats comprised foremost Indian muntjac, followed by wild boar, long-tailed goral, dusky leaf monkey, Malayan porcupine, and Indian hog deer only in the hot season from February to April. * In 1996, three leopards were fitted with radio collars in the south–central part of Kaeng Krachan National Park, a hilly terrain with seasonal evergreen forest. The study revealed home ranges of two male leopards of , and of a female of . They all preferred habitat where prey species accumulated and offered potential hunting opportunities, namely at altitudes of , river and valley corridors, and the main road, prior to higher elevations and forested terrain. Both male leopards slightly extended their home range during the wet season of June to October. Red muntjac, Malayan porcupine and gaur are the most abundant potential prey species in this protected area. * Between 1994 and 1999, ten leopards were fitted with radio collars in the northwestern part of Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary and followed over 9–41 months. The analysis of tracking data revealed mean annual home ranges of adult males of . Six adult females had the largest in Asia recorded home ranges of , which they all extended in the dry season from November to April. All leopards preferred dry evergreen and mixed deciduous forest with flat slope near water courses. Wild boar, macaque and lesser mouse deer were identified as the main potential prey species for the leopard in a highly fragmented secondary forest in Malaysia's Selangor area.  Threats  There are few contiguous areas left where leopards have a chance of long-term survival. They are primarily threatened by habitat destruction following large–scale deforestation, and prey depletion through illegal hunting.Sanei, A., Zakaria, M. (2011). Impacts of human disturbances on habitat use by the Malayan leopard in a fragmented secondary forest, Malaysia. Asia Life Sciences Supplement 7: 57-72. An increasingly growing threat is hunting for the illegal wildlife trade, which is showing its potential to do maximum harm in minimal time:Nowell, K., Jackson, P. (1996) Wild Cats: status survey and conservation action plan. IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group, Gland, Switzerland. leopards are increasingly being used as substitutes for tiger parts in traditional Chinese medicine, with the price of leopard parts rising as tiger parts become scarce. = Habitat destruction = Human traffic inside protected areas negatively affects leopard movements and activity. They show less diurnal activity in areas more heavily used by people. In villages located in Laos' protected areas, local people consume about meat of deer and wild boar annually per household. This offtake amounts to ungulates per , which is equivalent to the meat required to sustain several leopards per .ICEM (2003). Lao PDR National Report on Protected Areas and Development. Review of Protected Areas and Development in the Lower Mekong River Region, Indooroopilly, Queensland, Australia. In a highly fragmented tropical rain forest within Malaysia's capital agglomeration of Klang Valley leopard density has been estimated at 28.35 individuals per , which is one of the highest leopard densities reported. As a result of rapid shrinking of the forests, individuals may have been pushed into the remaining forest in this area, so that their population is unexpectedly high. Leopards were mostly affected by construction activities conducted inside the forest. = Illegal wildlife trade = Substantial domestic skin markets exist in Myanmar, in Malaysia for traditional medicines, and in China for skins and bones, the latter particularly as a substitute for the tiger in traditional Asian medicines and tonics. In China, the use of stockpiles of leopard bone is still permitted by the government by medicinal manufacturers, despite the domestic trade ban.Nowell, K. (2007). Asian big cat conservation and trade control in selected range States: evaluating implementation and effectiveness of CITES Recommendations. A TRAFFIC Report, June 2007. In Myanmar, 215 body parts of at least 177 leopards were observed in four markets surveyed between 1991 and 2006. Among the body parts, a leopard penis and testes were openly traded, along with other parts of freshly killed animals. Three of the surveyed markets are situated on international borders with China and Thailand, and attract international buyers, although leopards are completely protected under Myanmar's national legislation. Effective implementation and enforcement of CITES is considered inadequate. In early 2018, the carcass of a black leopard was discovered in Thailand's Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary, along with other animals. They were in the possession of a businessman who presided over the construction company Italian-Thai Development.

In motor racing, the drag reduction system (DRS) is a form of driver-adjustable bodywork aimed at reducing aerodynamic drag in order to increase top speed and promote overtaking. It is an adjustable rear wing of the car, which moves in response to driver commands.\\"2011 F1 Technical Regulations, Section 3.18\\" DRS often comes with conditions, such as the pursuing car must be within a second (when both cars cross the detection point) for DRS to be activated. DRS was introduced in Formula One in 2011. The use of DRS is an exception to the rule banning any moving parts whose primary purpose is to affect the aerodynamics of the car. The system is also used in the Formula Renault 3.5 since 2012,New Formula Renault 3.5 racer unveiled at Silverstone – Autoblog, 24 August 2011 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters since 2013,DTM's DRS system will be limited at Brands Hatch – Mattias Ekstrom – Autosport, 14 May 2013 Super Formula since 2014, GP2 Series later FIA Formula 2 Championship since 2015, GP3 Series later FIA Formula 3 Championship since 2017. An adjustable wing was also used by the Nissan DeltaWing at the 2012 24 Hours of Le Mans, although with free usage. Formula One In Formula One, the DRS opens an adjustable flap on the rear wing of the car, in order to reduce drag, thus giving a pursuing car an overtaking advantage over the car in front. The FIA estimate the speed increase to be between 10–12 km/h by the end of the activation zone. When the flap is closed it increases downforce, giving better cornering. The device can only be used during a race after two racing laps have been completed, and when the pursuing car enters a designated \\"activation\\" zone defined by the FIA. In , the FIA increased the number of DRS zones to two on some circuits featuring multiple long straights. In Valencia and in Montreal, two zones were endorsed on consecutive long straights, whilst in Monza and in Buddh, two zones were created on separate parts of the circuit. Two zones had originally been planned for every race with multiple long straights from Montreal onwards (depending on Montreal/Valencia success), but this was not implemented. However, at the penultimate round of the 2011 season, two zones on consecutive long straights saw a return at Yas Marina. When usage of the DRS remained legal for the season, a second zone was added to the opening round's track in Melbourne. A third DRS zone was added during 2018 and 2019 seasons in Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Austria, Singapore and Mexico.Third DRS zone added for F1 Australian GP at Albert Park - Luke Smith, Crash.net, 21 May 2018 =Functional description= The horizontal elements of the rear wing consist of the main plane and the flap. The DRS allows the flap to lift a maximum of 50 mm from the fixed main plane. This reduces opposition (drag) to airflow against the wing and results in less downforce. In the absence of significant lateral forces (straight line), less downforce allows faster acceleration and potential top speed, unless limited by the top gear ratio and engine rev limiter. Sam Michael, sporting director of the McLaren team, believes that DRS in qualifying will be worth about half a second per lap. The effectiveness of the DRS will vary from track to track and, to a lesser extent, from car to car. The system's effectiveness was reviewed in 2011 to see if overtaking could be made easier, but not to the extent that driver skill is sidelined. The effectiveness of DRS seems likely to be determined by the level of downforce at a given circuit (where the cars are in low drag trim at circuits like Monza, the effects may be smaller), by the length of the activation zone, and by the characteristics of the track immediately after the DRS zone. = Rules on use = DRS zones on the Sepang International Circuit in 2011. 1: DRS detection point. 2: DRS activation point. 3: approximate DRS deactivation point (braking zone before Turn 1) Use of DRS is restricted by the F1 rules; it is permitted only when both: * The following car is within one second of the car to be overtaken, which may be a car being lapped. The FIA may alter this parameter, race by race. * The following car is in an overtaking zone as defined by the FIA before the race (commonly known as the DRS zone). Further: * The system may not be activated on the first two laps after the race start, restart, or a safety car deployment. * The system cannot be used by the defending driver, unless within one second of another car in front. * The system may not be enabled if racing conditions are deemed dangerous by the race director, such as rain, as was the case at the 2011 Canadian Grand Prix. For , the drivers are only permitted to use DRS in the designated overtaking zones.

Reception  There has been a mixed reaction to the introduction of DRS in Formula One amongst both fans and drivers. Some believe that this is the solution to the lack of overtaking in F1 in recent years while others believe this has made overtaking too easy. Former Formula One and current Team Penske IndyCar Series driver Juan Pablo Montoya described it as \\"like giving Picasso Photoshop\\".Juan Pablo Montoya reckons DRS has made Formula 1 less challenging – Autosport, 26 April 2014 The principal argument for the opponents of DRS is that the driver in front does not have an equal chance of defending his position because they are not allowed to deploy DRS to defend.

Why do hens sham dustbathe when they have litter? Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 76: 53–64Merrill, R.J.N., Cooper, J.J., Albentosa M.J. and Nicol, C.J., 2006. The preferences of laying hens for perforated Astroturf over conventional wire as a dustbathing substrate in furnished cages. Animal Welfare, 15:173–178van Liere, D.W., 1992. The significance of fowls' bathing in dust. Animal Welfare, 1:187–202 This behaviour often has all the activities and temporal patterns of normal dustbathing, i.e. the bird initially scratches and bill-rakes at the ground, then erects its feathers and squats. Once lying down, the behaviour contains four main elements: vertical wing-shaking, head rubbing, bill-raking and scratching with one leg. Normal dustbathing is a maintenance behaviour whose performance results in dust collecting between the feathers. The dust is then subsequently shaken off which reduces the amount of feather lipids and so helps the plumage maintain good insulating capacity and may help control of ectoparasites.Olsson, I.A.S. and Keeling, L.J., 2005. Why in earth? Dustbathing behaviour in jungle and domestic fowl reviewed from a Tinbergian and animal welfare perspective. Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 93: 259-282 Terminology Sham dustbathing is sometimes referred to as \\"vacuum dustbathing\\". In the Konrad Lorenz model of behaviour regulation, vacuum activities occur when motivation for a certain behaviour builds to a sufficiently high level that the behaviour is performed in the complete absence of relevant stimuli. However, hens \\"dustbathing\\" on wire floors commonly perform this close to the feed trough where they can peck and bill- rake in the food.Lindberg, A.C. and Nicol, C.J. 1997. Dustbathing in modified battery cages: is sham dustbathing an adequate substitute? Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 55: 113–128 Because it seems the birds appear to treat the feed as a dustbathing substrate, the term \\"sham dustbathing\\" is more appropriate. Motivational basis A hen performing normal dustbathing Sham dustbathing, like normal dustbathing, appears to have both internal and external causal factors. =Internal causal factors= Under unrestricted conditions, adult birds dustbathe about every second day, with a diurnal rhythm peaking in the middle of the day, and an average dustbathing bout lasting about 27 minutes. Hens without litter (i.e. an absence of external causal factors) will perform sham dustbathing with a similar temporal pattern. Some hens deprived of litter until they had developed sham dustbathing and then given access to litter, showed sham dustbathing although litter was available. Thus, there is some support for an effect of habit or early experience on sham dustbathing. Depriving hens of the opportunity to dustbathe results in a rebound when hens are again allowed access to dust. Birds work for access to litter, in which case they sometimes, although not always, dustbathe. There are indications of stress when hens are deprived of the possibility to dustbathe, and if this deprivation is sufficiently long, sham dustbathing behaviour develops. =External causal factors= It has been suggested that the sight of other hens performing the behaviour increases the probability of sham dustbathing, i.e. social facilitation; however, when tested, the sight of stimulus birds had no effect on the sham dustbathing behaviour of test birds. As indicated above, hens \\"dustbathing\\" on wire floors commonly perform this close to the feed trough where they can peck and bill- rake in the food, indicating this may be an external causal factor. Welfare Sham dustbathing raises an interesting question in animal behaviour, motivation and welfare. Hens that have been reared in captivity without ever having encountered litter will perform sham dustbathing.Wichman, A. & Keeling, L.J., 2008. Hens are motivated to dustbathe in peat irrespective of being reared with or without a suitable dustbathing substrate. Animal Behaviour, 75: 1525-1533 Therefore, it can be questioned how these birds, which have never had the possibility to dustbathe in a functional substrate, perceive sham dustbathing; do they yearn for something that they have never had or known (i.e. litter), or are they content to sham dustbathe? A weighted push-door was used as the operant method to quantify motivation to dustbathe in adult hens with different previous experiences of litter. There was no difference between hens in the weight of doors they pushed open to gain access to peat. Hens that had no previous experience of peat were as motivated to work to gain access to this substrate as birds used to dustbathing in peat. This implies that sham dustbathing is not satisfying to the hen nor is it perceived as normal dustbathing.

The statue is a part of the city's Statues of the Liberators collection and is a tribute to former president of Mexico, Benito Juárez. Description The bronze sculpture is a full bust of Benito Juárez standing with his right arm raised and pointing into the distance. His right hand rests on a book, called Reforma, on top of a low pedestal. He wears a short double-breasted jacket with a long cape over his shoulders. The sculpture sits on a granite base and is inscribed: :A. CENCETFI (sic) :SCULTORE :ROMA 1891 The front base reads: Respect for the rights of others is peace BENITO JUAREZ 1806–1872 The people of Mexico to the people of the United States of America _Translation to Spanish:_ El respeto al derecho ajeno es paz BENITO JUAREZ 1806–1872 El pueblo de Mexico al pueblo de los Estados Unidos de America The names of the sculptors, Luis Sosa Villasenor and Louis Ortiz Macedo, are written on the lower back corner of the base, along with the date: Diciembre 1968 (December 1968). Information The sculpture was a gift to the United States from the people of Mexico in exchange for a statue of Abraham Lincoln from President Lyndon B. Johnson. The original statue of Juarez, which stands in Oaxaca, Mexico, was cast in Rome by the Nelli Foundry in 1891. The Washington statue is a cast of the original. It was authorized on October 17, 1968 and was cast at Fundidores Artísticos in Mexico City under the guidance of R. Moreno. The plasterwork was completed by Luis Ortiz Monesterio. The granite base was designed in the United States. The back of the base has a hidden urn which contains soil from San Pablo Guelatao, where Juárez was born. The piece sits in a plaza at an intersection with an inscription that reads: :En este sitio fue depositada :tierra de Guelatao, Oaxaca, :lugar de origen del presidente :Benito Juarez :7 de enero de 1969. (\\"In this site was laid soil from Guelatao, Oaxaca, birthplace of President Benito Juarez – 7 January 1969\\".) The sculpture is owned and maintained by the National Park Service (NPS). Condition The statue before undergoing conservation by the National Park Service In 1993 the Smithsonian Institution's Save Outdoor Sculpture! surveyed the sculpture and stated its conservation status as well maintained. Starting in November 2011, the National Park Service began repairs and rehabilitation on the monument and plaza. The base of the statue deteriorated, needing repair, and in November 2005 temporary restraining was placed around the base of the statue to help control the slippage of the facing stones on the monument base. A temporary barrier was placed around the base to deter pedestrian access. In 2010 the NPS contracted Oehrlein & Associates Architects to survey the sculpture and develop a repair plan. Using that report, NPS planned to repair the granite on both the pedestal and in the plaza, clean and repair the statue, repair loose lettering and reinstall missing lettering, and finally, waterproof the statue. The work, due to be completed by spring 2012, will be completed on site.

Military service Boehm joined the Kaiserliche Marine on 1 April 1903 as a cadet and did his basic training on SMS Stein. He was promoted to Kapitänleutnant on 19 September 1914 and during the First World War commanded various torpedo boats (such as SMS G41 during the Battle of Jutland and later SMS V 69). In 1919 he was dismissed from the service, but when the navy was reactivated as the Reichsmarine in 1920 he was recalled to it, mainly serving in staff posts until 1933. On 3 October 1933 Boehm was made the commander of the Hessen for a year, until he was promoted to Konteradmiral in autumn 1934 and appointed commander in chief of the navy's reconnaissance forces. From 25 August 1936 to 3 August 1937, during the opening stages of the Spanish Civil War, he commanded the German naval forces off the Spanish coast. On 1 April 1937 he was promoted to vice admiral and put in command of the North Sea Station. Early in 1938 he became a full admiral and in November the same year Flottenchef (fleet commander). Shortly after the Battle of the River Plate, Boehm was relieved of command and left without a post for several months. After the invasion of Norway in April 1940, he was made the commander of German naval forces there on 10 April 1940, being promoted to General Admiral on 1 April the following year. In March 1943 he was recalled from Norway and on 31 May that year officially discharged from active service, effective on the following 1 June. From 1 March 1944 to 31 March 1945 he commanded the inspectorate of the Kriegsmarine's education programme, at the end of which post he was fully discharged from the Kriegsmarine.

The adet-i deştbani may have arisen as a result of tension between nomadic livestock- herders and settled farmers; the former's animals would encroach on, and damage, the latter's arable land; to discourage this, an official called a deştban (who was responsible to a sipahi) was responsible for crop protection - they also guarded against crop theft. If a farmer's horses, cattle, sheep or goats escaped and damaged another person's crops, then the farmer was liable to pay a fine, of a fixed amount per animal. This was separate from any compensation to the owner of the crops. The level of adet-i deştbani could vary from time to time and from place to place; in Mosul in 1540, it was set at 5 akçes per animal. A later kanunname (for the Morea and Anavarin in 1716) set a combined tariff of taxes and corporal punishment; after any damage had been estimated, a straying horse, mule, or ox would earn its owner 5 blows in addition to a 5 akçe fine; 4 akçes for a cow, 1 akçe for a calf or sheep - plus 1 blow per 2 sheep. The adet-i deştbani was considered to be a bad-i hava tax along with fines from crimes, the tapu charge for registration of land ownership, and the resm-i arusane (bride tax). It was a relatively minor tax, accounting for a small proportion of revenue from the raya. Surviving tax records for the village of Sakal Dutan in 1550 show a total of 30 akçes for adet-i deştbani - far smaller than the 300 akçes paid on wheat and barley crops, or the 170 akçes of land-tax such as resm-i çift. One source even describes adet-i deştbani as a fee for the protection of crops; the fee being half a pinte of butter (worth 30 akçes).

His best event was the 880 yard run, in which he became the national champion three times and established a long-lived world record time of 1:53.4. Biography Charles Henry Kilpatrick was born in Albany, New York on October 23, 1874 to an Irish-American family. Kilpatrick became a noted runner while at the New York State Normal High School. He went on to study at Union College, joining the Beta Theta Pi fraternity there. It was at Union College that Kilpatrick reached his peak as a runner, breaking the world record in the 880 yards and becoming both intercollegiate and national champion in that event. In 1896, Kilpatrick switched to Princeton University, continuing his running career there. He then became athletic director at University of Wisconsin before returning to his home state and entering the employ of Spalding. Kilpatrick died of heart failure in New York City on December 5, 1921. Running career While at Union College, Kilpatrick became the world's leading half-miler, becoming intercollegiate champion in 1894 and US champion three times between 1894 and 1896. In a September 21, 1895 dual meet between the New York Athletic Club (which Kilpatrick represented) and the London Athletic Club, described by Sports Illustrated as the first major international track meet ever, Kilpatrick easily won the 880 yards, establishing a new world record of 1:53.4. This time demolished Walter Dohm's previous record of 1:54.5, and was only beaten 14 years later by Emilio Lunghi of Italy. Kilpatrick also represented his club in the three mile run, in which he quit after five laps; this was of no consequence, as only wins counted and teammate Thomas Conneff easily took the race home.

In 2011, he was charged with treason in a high-profile trial and named a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International. Olympics scandal and arrest Kavumbagu is director of the Burundian Internet news agency Net Press. Net Press website On 11 September 2008, he was arrested following the publication of an article in which he alleged that the cost of President Pierre Nkurunziza's trip to see the Beijing Olympics (an estimated 100 million Burundian francs) caused some civil servants’ salaries to be paid late. Following a government statement that the trip had only cost half of the alleged amount, Kavumbagu was charged with \\"libelous writing and insulting remarks.\\" Amnesty International, the Committee to Protect Journalists, and International PEN protested his arrest and called for his immediate release. Kavumbagu was cleared by a court in March 2009 and released from prison.. However, the prosecutor appealed the case, and as of July 2010, it remains open. Bombing response and second trial On 11 July 2010, Kampala, Uganda was attacked by suicide bombers from Al-Shabaab, a Somali Islamist militia, killing 74 and injuring 70. The following day, Kavumbagu published a blog post on his site which criticized the ability of Burundian forces to defend the country in the face of a similar attack: “The anxiety has been palpable in Bujumbura and all those who have heard about [the bombings] yesterday in Kampala were convinced that if the al- Shabaab militants wanted to try ‘something' in our country, they would succeed with disconcerting ease, [as] our defense and security forces shine in their capacity to pillage and kill their compatriots rather than defend our country.\\" On 17 July, he was arrested, charged with treason, questioned without the presence of a lawyer, and imprisoned in Mpimba Central Prison, Bujumbura. In Burundi, treason carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. His arrest was again denounced by a number of international human rights organizations, including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and Front Line. A number of journalism and press freedom organizations have called for the charges against Kavumbagu to be dropped, including the Committee to Protect Journalists, the International Federation of Journalists, International PEN, the Federation of African Journalists, the Eastern Africa Journalists Association, and Reporters Without Borders. In November 2010, Kavumbagu was denied a request for bail, and was housed with violent offenders. On 13 April 2011, the trial's prosecutor announced his intention to seek a life sentence. On 3 May, World Press Freedom Day, around 100 Burundian journalists marched into Bujumbura to demonstrate support for Kavumbagu. On 13 May, Kavumbagu was acquitted of treason, but found guilty on the charge of publishing an article \\"likely to discredit the state or economy\\". He was sentenced to eight months' imprisonment and released for time served. Human Rights Watch and the Committee to Protect Journalists protested the verdict, the latter reiterating its belief that \\"Burundi should decriminalize press offenses and allow journalists to speak and write freely without fear of harassment or arrest\\".

This species is native of the steppes of Central Asia, but it is also present in most of Europe, in the eastern Palearctic realm, in North Africa, and in the Near East. Distribution and habitat Calliptamus italicus is found in Western Europe and Central Asia.Fauna europaea Its range extends from North Africa and the countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea to Central Europe, Central Asia, Mongolia and western Siberia. These grasshoppers can be encountered from July through October. It thrives in warm dry habitats with sparse vegetation cover such as grasslands and rocky steppes, old quarries, gravel pits, rock-strewn areas beside rivers, sand dunes and fallow land. Description Young Calliptamus italicus is a medium-sized grasshopper characterized by a significant sexual dimorphism. The adult males grow up to long, while females reach of length. This species is quite variable in size and colour. The basic coloration of the body varies from gray to brownish- reddish. The wings have a characteristic reddish or pinkish coloration, better visible when the insect is in flight. Quite evident is the dilating membrane ('pallium') of the subgenital plate of males. Ecology Calliptamus italicus is a polyphagous species, able to feed upon various wild plants, but also on crops, especially legumes. Alfalfa (Medicago sativa) is among the species preferred by juveniles, but there have been reported sporadic cases of infestation on grains and grapevine. It feeds on a variety of plants in the families Asteraceae, Chenopodiaceae and Poaceae. Their life cycle lasts one year. The egg-laying takes place in late August - early September, usually in rocky areas exposed to the south. The female lays eggs in the soil within an ootheca that can hold 25 to 55 eggs wrapped in a spongy secretion. The appearance of the larvae takes place in May–June; the first adults appear in July. In certain circumstances this species may develop a tendency to gregariousness with formation of very numerous aggregates, potentially harmful to crops. It normally occurs in low densities in undisturbed sparse grassland but disappears when the land is cultivated. It occurs in high densities in uncultivated land that is invaded by Artemisia, and on overgrazed pastures with weeds and bare ground. Under these conditions it can become gregarious and form locust swarms. After the breakup of the USSR in 1991, much agricultural land was left uncultivated.
