The couple had eleven children and she successfully ran a plantation allowing her to acquire numerous other properties, to become the wealthiest free black woman in the colony at the time of her death. Life Amaryllis Renn Phillips was born into slavery in 1745 on Barbados, during British colonial rule where records indicate she was a mulatto. She was purchased by Robert Collmore in 1780, from Rebecca Phillips, a free coloured hotelier, along with her five mulatto children, four of whom were Robert's children. In 1784, Robert arranged their manumission by selling her and the children to a friend, James Scuffield. Selling a slave to a trusted third-party to avoid high manumission fees was a common practice during the period in Barbados. Robert acquired Lightfoots, a 42-acre sugar plantation with its 44 slaves, to provide for her and the children. Collymore expanded the estate to over a hundred acres and was able to buy seven properties throughout Bridgetown, on Canary Street, High Street and James Street, which she rented out. She also ran a successful shop. By 1805, Collymore owned another property, on Roebuck Street, which she sold for ¬£800. She and her daughter, Katherine Anne Collymore, were the recipients of a bequest from Renn Phillips in his 1809 will. In 1824, when Robert died, he bequeathed she and her eleven children, full title to Lightfoots and the slaves working on the plantation. Among her children, besides Katherine were Frances Lasley, Margaret Jane, and Robert (baptized 18 February 1792), Thomazin Ashby (baptized 6 June 1795), Elizabeth Clarke (baptized 13 June 1798), Samuel Francis Collymore, Jackson Brown Collymore and Renn Phillips Collymore, who would become the great-great grandfather of Frank Collymore. Collymore's will, dated 1826 (or 1829 but which was probably the date the estate was probated), left her estate, worth over ¬£10,000 to relatives. She devised a home in Bridgetown and a plantation known as Haggat Hall, and 67 slaves, as well as silver and personal property. At the time of her death she was \\"the richest free woman of color in pre-emancipation Barbados\\". Death and legacy Collymore died on 16 December 1828 and was buried in the St. Mary's Churchyard in Bridgetown. The house that Collymore and her children occupied is now the Morningside Building, and houses the Arts Department of the Barbados Community College.

Christmas in Finland begins, as is commonplace on public holidays in Finland, on Christmas Eve. Especially the evening of Christmas Eve has become the most important day of the Christmas period, and is nowadays a paid holiday in most workplaces. Unlike on other public holidays, public transportation stops almost completely on the afternoon of Christmas Eve (linkin sis√§lt√∂ lienee muuttunut) in Finland. The Christmas period ends on Epiphany.  History  In the Finnish tradition, the Christmas period has usually been considered to start on Tuomas‚Äôs nameday on December 21 and to continue until St. Knut's Day on January 13. This is reflected in several rhymes and jingles, such as Hyv√§ Tuomas joulun tuopi, paha Nuutti pois sen viepi (‚ÄúGood Tuomas the bringer, bad Nuutti the taker of Christmas‚Äù). Prior to 1774, Finland also celebrated a third Christmas Day, the day of apostle John the Evangelist on December 27, and a fourth Christmas Day, Massacre of the Innocents on December 28. However, King Gustav III of Sweden cut them down to two, because the nobility and bourgeoisie believed that long holidays made the workers too lazy.Harjumaa, Marika: What a miracle Christmas plum ?. Evening messages plus, 2009, no. 23.12.2009, p. 7. The third and fourth Christmas Day have also been called little holidays or midweek holidays. The Finnish Orthodox Church spends Christmas at the same time as the Western Christianity. A Finnish Father Chrtistmas. The Finnish Christmas has acquired some characteristics from the harvest festival kekri, that used to take place around the old All Saints' Day. In Sweden, Estonia and Finland, joulupukki (Christmas goat) was a man who dressed as a fertility rite character, a goat. He put goat horns on his head as in shamanistic tradition to look like a goat. The outfit also included a mask made of birch bark and a sheepskin coat worn inside-out. Feeding small birds at Christmas is an old tradition and the peasant culture‚Äôs ritual that brought good luck to farming. The purpose of the barley or oat sheaf was to keep the birds away from the crop in the summer. The Finnish pagans may have believed that the dead, i.e. soul birds, celebrated the mid-winter holiday with the living. They may have also believed birds to bring good luck to the home.Lempi√§inen 2008, s. 96. In Sweden, the church was against this tradition, and it was about to disappear in Finland too, until some newspapers and charitable organisations revived it. Some traditional Christmas decorations are himmeli (a hanging decoration made of straw) and Yule Goat. Decorations made of straw have their source in kekri, the harvest festival.Aurej√§rvi- Karjalainen 1999, s. 192. The first Christmas trees came to Finland in the middle of the 1800s. Early-morning Christmas church on Christmas Day morning is part of the Protestant tradition. The Christmas gospel is heard and Luther‚Äôs hymn 21 Enkeli taivaan (Vom Himmel hoch, da komm ich her) is sung. Previously the Lutheran church was very strict about attending the Christmas church. If you did not attend, you were reprimanded publicly in the annual catechetical meeting. Reading the Christmas gospel before the meal became common at the end of the 1800s as a consequence of the Christian revival. Having a sauna at Christmas is an old tradition. People washed in the Christmas sauna before the festivities, and food and drink gifts were left there for the elf. People in wealthy families started giving each other presents at the beginning of the 1800s.Aurej√§rvi-Karjalainen 1999, s. 193. Christmas calendars arrived in Finland after the second world war.Aurej√§rvi- Karjalainen 1999, s. 191. The tradition to visit cemeteries to light candles on family graves was started in the 1900s. It became a common practice at the graves of fallen soldiers after the Winter War and soon at other graves too. The Kekri tradition of leaving presents for the dead was moved to Christmas. Nowadays candles may be lighted as a common experience to honor the dead.Aurej√§rvi-Karjalainen 1999, s. 190. Eating abundantly at the Christmas meal comes from the ancient Finns and relates to the agricultural year cycle and the festival of light celebrated around the winter solstice. At a time when food was grown at home, gluttony and eating meat at Christmas was rare luxury. Lutefisk and porrige are some of the oldest Christmas foods. Barley was replaced by rice in the 1800s. Casseroles, prune soup and gingerbread biscuits were adopted from the upper classes in the 1800s and 1900s. The Christmas ham replaced the kekri lamb, and in the 1940s it was challenged by the wild turkey. Posti Group has been publishing Christmas stamps since 1973. Christmas has traditionally been a family celebration, but in the 2000s it has become common to spend Christmas alone.  Celebrating Christmas  The usual Christmas decorations are spruce twigs, Christmas tree, Christmas wreaths, straw goats, himmelis, apples, candles, Christmas tablecloths, Christmas flowers, outdoor torches, ice lanterns and sheafs. To preserve nature, some people choose a tree in the garden or nearby forest to decorate for the birds, instead of buying a Christmas tree. The tree is decorated with fat balls. Before giving out the presents, some may light candles for the dead. It is commonplace to go in the sauna at Christmas. The Finnish Yule table normally features different casseroles made usually of carrot, swede (lanttulaatikko) or potato (sweetened potato casserole) and various fish, such as cold smoked salmon, gravlax and Coregonus lavaretus (graavisiika). On Christmas Eve people usually eat rice porridge.

It was produced on Broadway in 1935 by Martin Jones, where it ran for 11 months and 373 performances. It is one of the early Broadway plays to combine father-son conflict with race issues. Plot Act One On the Norwood Plantation in Polk County, Georgia, Colonel Norwood and his African slave, Cora Lewis, have four children together: William, who still lives on the plantation and who has a son of his own; two daughters, Bertha and Sallie, who are light enough to pass for white; and Robert, a.k.a. Bert, who is 18 and who has Norwood's facial features. Robert has been away at an all-Colored school since he was a young boy and is visiting the plantation for the first time in many years. In Act One, we learn that Robert has been refusing to follow all the expected behaviors for Mulatto people and has been asserting himself as Norwood's heir, much to the shock of the local townspeople and to Norwood's anger. Cora, meanwhile, is revealed to have secretly sent her daughters to secretarial school, so that they can move up north and have good jobs, but has been telling the Colonel that they are learning to be cooks. Act Two * Scene 1: Cora calls in Robert and leaves him alone to speak with Norwood. Norwood tells Robert he is to leave his property for his behavior, bringing out his pistol as a threat. Norwood tells Robert that his overseer Talbot and the storekeeper are coming to ensure that Robert leaves. Robert and Norwood get into a heated argument that ends with Robert strangling Norwood and taking his gun. Cora comes in and tells Robert to run away as he will most certainly be executed when found. When Talbot and the storekeeper arrive at the house and find Norwood's corpse they call for help and immediately begin a search for Robert. * Scene 2: The undertaker arrives to take Norwood's body to town. Sam and William decide to leave the property, fearful of getting caught up in the violence of the mob hunting Robert. They ask Cora to go with them but she refuses and stays behind to wait for Robert. Cora is clearly unstable and throughout the scene, she speaks to Norwood as if he were alive and in the room with her. Robert shows up back at the house, the sounds of the lynch mob close behind. He goes upstairs and kills himself with the Colonel's gun as the mob breaks into the house to seize him. Characters *Colonel Thomas Norwood: originally played by Stuart Beebe. Norwood is 60 years old. He has a quick temper. He Is a commanding colonel. His wife is dead so he took up Cora as a lover and fathered 4 of the mulatto children, but he refuses to acknowledge them as his own, even though he allows them to go to school. He is also Cora's boss. Cora's mother helped raise him. He cares greatly about what people think of him. *Cora Lewis: originally played by Rose McClendon. She is Norwood's mistress. Cora met Norwood when she was 15, which is when they first had sexual relations. Her relationship with Norwood is encouraged by her mother on the grounds that her life would be better with him than if she stayed in the fields. She lives with him separate to the other slaves. She has four children with him. She did not move into the house until Norwood's wife died, at that point she was carrying their first child William. She knows her \\"place\\" in this hostile and racist world and cares for her family's survival over everything. She even risks her safety for the salvation of her children by sending them off to school. By the end of the play, she has become more defiant against the white people, refusing to answer Talbot. *William Lewis: originally played by Morris McKenney *Sallie Lewis: originally played by Jeanne Green *Robert Lewis: originally played by Hurst Amyx. Robert is the youngest son of Cora, and he is rebellious. He stands up for his rights, doesn't want to bow down to the \\"whites,\\" even though his mother asks him not to be rebellious because she wants him to be safe and alive. Robert is the only one who wants things to change, the rest just want to be safe. But, he says if they all stay quiet things, will never change. *Fred Higgins: originally played by Frank Jaquet *Sam: Sam is a servant that does everything he is told to do by Norwood. He is loyal to Norwood, and he will tell on anyone who does not obey Norwood's orders. Even though he is loyal to Norwood, he is relived from all his fear after he finds our Norwood is dead. *Billy: *Talbot: originally played by John Boyd. He is the overseer of the slaves that work on Norwood's plantation. Always angry and wanting to punish the slaves for the most minuscule mistakes. *Mose: *Storekeeper: originally played by Clark Poth *Undertaker: originally played by Howard Negley. The undertakers job was to remove the body. He likes to drink, Yells for Cora to get liquor she doesn't because she doesn't work for him. He is A man who is probably white due to the way he treats Cora. *Undertaker's Helper: *Mob Reception Historian Joseph McLaren notes that the play was popular with audiences because they were intrigued by the tragic mulatto theme. Critics, however, were more negative, perhaps in part because director/producer Martin Jones altered much of the plot, moving the play away from tragedy and into melodrama. Melinda D. Wilson notes that Jones's addition of a rape scene may have helped sell tickets, but also may have reinforced stereotypes of violent and promiscuous blacks‚Äîthe kinds of stereotypes that Negro and Mulatto writers of the time were trying to stamp out. Literary scholar Germain J. Bienvenu argues that the play also examines the ways Negro/Mulatto people of the time held prejudices against other Negro/Mulattoes.

Cats exposed to allergens may develop allergies or allergic reactions. Allergies tend to become evident and intensify over extended periods of time and can take years to develop. Some allergic diseases and allergies in cats include feline atopic dermatitis, flea allergy dermatitis, feline-mosquito hypersensitivity, and food-induced allergy. In the case of feline atopy, hypersensitivity to allergens is due to genetic predisposition. However, various allergies may arise due to environmental factors. Allergens, ingested, inhaled, or airborne, can be seasonal or non-seasonal, similar to allergies in humans. Suspected seasonal allergens include but are not limited to pollen, fleas, and mosquito bites; suspected non-seasonal allergens include but are not limited to plastic materials, food, dust, trees, and grass. After exposure to suspected allergens, symptoms may be immediate or delayed, arising within a few minutes to two hours. Symptoms can include both dermatological and gastrointestinal signs such as itchy skin, hair loss and excessive scratching. In cases of feline atopic dermatitis or atopy in cats, pruritic skin diseases may result; however, signs can also include miliary dermatitis, symmetrical alopecia, and lesions of the eosinophilic granuloma complex. Food allergies account for approximately 10% of allergies in both dogs and cats. Food allergies are often mistaken for food intolerances, which can result in vomiting and diarrhea instead of dermal issues. In most cases where food allergies occur, they do so with foods that cats eat most often. Common food allergens in cats include beef, dairy, fish, eggs, and chicken. Preservatives and other additives are also occasionally involved in triggering an allergic reaction. There is no specific breed or age range that food allergies target; however, there are certain breeds that are more susceptible to food allergies than others. For example, Siamese and Siamese crosses may have a higher risk of food allergies than other breeds.  Allergy identification and treatment  While it is possible to identify what type of symptoms the cat is suffering from, it is best to seek attention from a veterinarian to identify the best treatment possible. In order to identify to which allergens the cat is allergic, veterinarians will commonly use a serum allergy test. Veterinarians will often recommend over the counter allergy relief products to alleviate mild problems. If the allergy is more severe, allergy immunotherapy may be recommended.  Hypoallergenic elimination diets for cats  =Limited ingredient diets= A limited-ingredient diet, also known as limited-antigen food, is an elimination diet that restricts the problematic foods that cause a reaction. Usually these diets focus on removing specific proteins (protein-elimination diets) due to dietary allergies usually being caused by water-soluble glycoproteins, but they can also be targeted towards the removal of gluten/wheat, vegetables, or a combination of both. In commercially available versions of these diets, producers usually include one protein and one carbohydrate source, in an effort to minimize reactions to any foods. =Homemade diets= Homemade diets are a type of elimination diet, which are made specifically for the cat with allergies, either by the owner or a third-party person like a chef. Studies suggest that commercial elimination diets may still react negatively with a cat, even if they are devoid of the target protein/other problematic foods. Many pet owners, for this reason, choose the homemade option, as it allows them to personally identify the pet's history, tailor the diet with various ingredients, and consider the process a bonding experience. Some drawbacks to a homemade diet are the time needed to shop for the ingredients and the potential financial setback. Also, homemade diets are generally nutritionally deficient. For example, a study found that 90% of homemade elimination diets are not adequate in terms of nutrition. However, homemade diets are a great way to determine which ingredient is causing the negative symptoms in the cat. =Hydrolyzed proteins= Hydrolyzed proteins are often used as the primary source of protein in a diet, particularly in elimination diets, since these proteins do not cause allergenic responses. This is because the digestive tract breaks down the protein into individual amino acids that the body is unable to recognize as the offending protein, allowing the protein source to bypass the allergenic immune response associated with IgE. This avoidance of the immune reaction allows the animal to eat a sufficient protein source without the immune system interfering. =Novel proteins= A novel protein is a protein source used in hypoallergenic diets to which the cat has not previously been exposed. Common examples of novel proteins are lamb, rabbit, venison, duck, elk, kangaroo, ostrich, emu, goose and goat. However, there is a chance of cross-reactivity when there is a higher taxonomic relationship between the two species. For example, cross-reactivity could be caused by other ruminant meats if the cat reacted negatively to beef, or avian meats if the cat reacted negatively to chicken. Rabbit meat Novel proteins can be used in elimination diets as well for long-term management. Many commercialized novel protein diets are nutritionally adequate and balanced. They have only one protein source and one carbohydrate source that the cats are unlikely to have ingested before. Owners are more likely to be compliant when feeding a commercial novel protein diet than when feeding a home cooked diet. This is due to the fact that it can be difficult to obtain novel proteins for food preparation, and it takes less time to provide a commercial diet than to prepare a home cooked one. In the early '90s, an experiment was performed showing that novel protein diets had a 70 to 80% success rate. However, commercialized novel protein diets are not always effective, since they are not always tested on animals that have food sensitivities, and the manufacturing process of the diets can cause adverse reactions due to the inclusion of additives which may be allergens to some cats. It is recommended that human-grade meat be used in the diet instead of pet food meats since pet food meats can include preservatives, which can be detrimental to the success of the diet. Also, a study showed that if the processing machinery was not cleaned properly, ground meat that came from one animal could be contaminated with the ground meat from another animal.

It is endemic to Taiwan and found in the eastern and southern parts of the island. Buergeria japonica, with whom Buergeria otai was confused before described as a distinct species in 2017, occurs in northwestern Taiwan. The two species have only a narrow contact zone and can be distinguished based on genetic markers, calls, and morphology. Etymology The specific name otai honours professor Hidetoshi Ota, in recognition of his \\"great contribution to herpetology and biogeography in East Asia\\". Common name Ota's stream tree frog has been suggested for this species. Description Adult males measure and adult females in snout‚Äìvent length. The body is elongated and moderately slender. The tympanum is barely discernible, whereas the supratympanic fold is prominent. Males have comparatively large subgular vocal sac. The fingers are slender, without webbing, and bear medium-sized discs. The toes are long, partially webbed, and also bear medium-sized discs. Dorsal coloration is variable, depending on light conditions and the background. During daytime, resting frogs are usually grayish. Calling males at night show a range of colors, from gray, yellow, gold, light brown, to dark orange. There is a dark dorsal marking resembling letter X or H that may almost fade away. Females usually turn brownish during amplexus. The chin and the belly are gray-white. The chin has small irregular mottling and there are tiny white spots on the ventral side of the thighs. Buergeria otai can emit two types of calls, \\"short calls\\" consisting of regular, long and lasting consecutive pulses (usually about 16‚Äì17), and \\"long calls\\" that have a major peak at the beginning, a serial of vary rapid pulses, and usually an ending with another short peak. The former call is similar to the call of Buergeria japonica, whereas the latter is unique. Calling male Dorsal view Habitat and conservation Buergeria otai is associated with streams at elevations below . They are primarily found in small ditches or shallow waters near the streams, rather than in the major river course. Reproduction can take place year round, but peak breeding occurs in April to July. The tadpoles are benthic herbivores or detritivores and live in shallow waters. Similarly to Buergeria japonica, this species has tolerance to high temperatures found in hot springs. The tadpoles may even seek high temperatures. Whether this species also shares the salt tolerance of Buergeria japonica is unknown. Wang and colleagues suggest that Buergeria otai might the most abundant rhacophorid in Taiwan; there are huge populations especially in the eastern part of Taiwan. As of late 2017, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has not yet assessed this species.

Since 2013, he is Scientific Director of the Research Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP) in Vienna. Early life and education Jan-Michael Peters grew up in Schleswig-Holstein and referred to an interest in biology that goes back to his childhood. Peters started studying at the University of Kiel in 1982, where he received his pre-diploma in Biology. In 1988, he completed his diploma studies at the University of Heidelberg, where he also obtained his PhD in cell biology in 1991. Working with Werner Franke during his PhD studies, Peters discovered p97-ATPase and first characterized the 26S proteasome. Career and research Between 1992 and 1993, Peters continued working with Werner W. Franke as a postdoctoral fellow at the German Cancer Research Center DKFZ in Heidelberg, where he worked on the first purification and electron microscopy of 26S proteasome. In 1994, Peters joined the lab of Marc W. Kirschner at Harvard Medical School in Boston as a postdoctoral fellow. There, he discovered the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) and other enzymes required for chromosome segregation. In 1996, Peters moved to Vienna to become Junior Group Leader at the Research Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP), and was promoted to Senior Scientist in 2002. In 2011, he became the institute‚Äôs Scientific Deputy Director and in 2013 Scientific Director, succeeding Barry Dickson. Peters‚Äô research group studies the molecular mechanisms of chromosome organization, chromosome segregation and cell division in a variety of model organisms. Peters characterized the regulation and operating principle of a number of proteins that are responsible for the correct chromosome segregation during mitosis. Using the enzyme Polo-like Kinase 1 (Pik1), Peters characterized a cell division enzyme that has shown to be a promising target for chemotherapy against certain cancers. Peters was the coordinator of the European Science Foundation network grant EuroDYNA (2005-2008) that is fostering interaction among various collaborative research projects. He contributed to this program when he discovered the relationship between two proteins, cohesin and CTCF, in regulating the expression and transcription of genes. Between 2004 and 2009, Peters also coordinated the EU funded research project MitoCheck, aimed at the identification of genes that play a key role in the process of mitosis. Between 2010 and 2015, he headed the follow-up project MitoSys, through which biologists, mathematicians, biochemists and biophysicists collaborated to reveal how genes and proteins orchestrate mitosis in human cells. This project was accompanied by an art project seeking to link science and society.

BRILL, Jan 1, 2001. pp.51.), also abbreviated as PERMI, was a political party espoused Islamic-nationalism based in Padang Panjang, founded in 1930. The party was dissolved due to the crackdown by the Dutch East Indies colonial government in 1937. PERMI is regarded as a political party active against the colonial repression by the Dutch. Unlike other political parties, PERMI was unique in its embracing of both political Islam and nationalism and placed them two in a parallel position. History PERMI was originated from the mass organization Persatuan Sumatera Thawalib, which was founded in 1928 by the former members of Sumatera Thawalib after its dissolution. At the third congress held in Padang Panjang, Persatuan Sumatera Thawalib had transformed itself into the political party.Sumatera Thawalib, Sekolah Islam Modern Pertama di Indonesia. Padang Kita. Retrieved November 29, 2017. Initially, the center of activity was placed in its place of origin, however, later it had moved to Padang. Two years after the establishment, PERMI had grown into one of the prominent parties in West Sumatra, and expanded its influence to other regions such as Tapanuli, East Sumatra, Aceh, Bengkulu and South Sumatra. At its peak in December 1932, PERMI held 7,700 members, among them 4,700 men and 3,000 women. Its activity ranged from education, scouting, publishing of news outlets and pamphlets, and holding of public meetings.Ingelson, 1979. pp.230. =Repression= Since its establishment, PERMI had already reaped suspicion among the Dutch colonial government which saw the organization as a threat. This was due to the PERMI spokespersons and politicians often referred to the Dutch repression during their campaigns. By the end of 1932, its activity began to get restricted and figures were getting apprehended. Rasuna Said, one of the leaders of PERMI who voiced against the Dutch colonization was arrested in December 1932.Hj. Rasuna Said. Pahlawan Center. Retrieved November 29, 2017. Other figures who got arrested simultaneously including Rasimah Ismail, a women's rights activist.Blackburn, Susan. Indonesian women and political Islam. Journal of Southeast Asian Studies / Volume 39 / Issue 01 / February 2008, pp 83‚Äì105. pp.87. Muchtar Lutfi, an intellectual of PERMI was arrested in July 1933. Several other PERMI leaders were put under house arrest. Eventually, the party was restricted from the gathering. Under this condition, PERMI leaders had attempted to communicate each other through written methods, however, they also got confiscated. The author Ilyas Ya'kub and the publisher Djalaluddin Thaib were arrested in September. Lutfi, Ya'kub and Thaib were deported to Boven Digoel Regency in 1934. These repressions had effectively disabled the party, and the remaining leader Muhammad Sjafei had dissolved the party on October 18, 1937. Ideology PERMI's position on both Islam and nationalism reflected the understanding of these issues shared among the Minangkabau society during the time. This position criticized the other nationalist parties which were chiefly modeled after the nationalist movement in India and inclined to be reluctant to see Islam as a unifying factor of the national struggle. In PERMI's view, as a nation whose 90% of the population adheres to Islamic identity, the fear of accepting Islamic principle was as if \\"tiger is afraid to enter into the jungle, or water refuses to flow into the sea.\\" Because of this, PERMI often challenged both secular nationalist parties and Islamic parties which perceived as taking one-dimensional approach. Mohammed Natsir, a leading figure of PERSIS, an Islamic mass organization founded during the National Awakening Era, scoffed PERMI as Islam in the name only, and he attempted to build the authenticity of PERSIS on the ground of dedication toward Islam in contrast with PERMI. The philosophy of PERMI also differed from the certain Minangkabau figures such as Mohammad Hatta who, albeit himself a Muslim, opposed to the idea of a religious political party from the position of the separation of church and state. PERMI's ideology was highly influenced by Islamic Modernism promoted by Rashid Rida, who advocated for the return to the Qur'an and hadith, compatibility of Islam and modern scientific education and abolishing of non-orthodoxy and innovations. Modernism in Indonesia was already proliferated among the Muslim society in West Sumatra. However, it was only after the establishment of PERMI that such philosophy had gained the vehicle for political mobilization. PERMI's position was further reinforced by the return of two Minangkabau Islamic intellectuals from Cairo, Iliyas Ya'kub and Muchtar Lutfi. Ilyas Ya'kub, in the header of the February 1931 issue of the political magazine Medan Rakjat, grieved the situation of Indonesian society for what he called a split between the Muslim and nationalist blocs. In his view, although two ideologies have different origins, they have no contradiction in their respective aims. He called for the inclusion of the PERMI slogan \\"Islam and nationalism\\" into the political arena in order to solve the crisis.

It is based in Toronto, Canada, is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, and is a constituent of the S&P;/TSX 60. The company was founded by Mark Leonard, a former venture capitalist, in 1996. It went public in 2006, and now has 13,000 employees spread over 6 operating segments.  Business  The company's business strategy is to acquire software companies, and then hold them for the long term. It has acquired over 500 businesses since being founded. It focuses on vertical market software companies (i.e. those that create software for a particular industry or market, as opposed to creating software usable for a wide variety of markets). Most of its acquisitions are relatively small (for less than $5 million), although the company has indicated that it may pursue larger acquisitions in the future. For instance, Constellation acquired Acceo Solutions for $250 million in January 2018, the second-largest acquisition in its history. Although the company has experienced great success with this strategy in the past (its stock has increased 30 times since its IPO in 2006), it has experienced more competition in acquiring companies in recent years, especially from private equity and hedge funds. As of 2016, 67% of revenue was from customers in the public sector, while the other 33% was from customers in the private sector. 12% of revenue was from Canada, 52% from the US, 30% from Europe, and 5% from the rest of the world.  Operating Segments  Constellation Software has six operating segments: * Volaris Group: focuses on acquiring software businesses serving various areas, including agri-business, financial services, and education. It has approximately 45 constituent software businesses. * Harris Computer Systems: primarily serves the public sector, including utilities, education, and healthcare. It has 31 constituent businesses. * Jonas Software: operates 70 companies, primarily in the hospitality and construction sectors. * Vela Software: operates 8 divisions, primarily focuses on the industrial sector, including oil and gas and manufacturing * Perseus Operating Group: operates in a variety of industries, including home building, pulp and paper, and real estate * Total Specific Solutions: focuses on software companies in the UK and Europe. Total was acquired in December 2013 for $360 million.  Controversy  In 2016, the founder of Innoprise Software sued Harris Computer Systems for giving away its software for free, thus reducing the value of a revenue-sharing agreement. The founder and chairman of Constellation Software, Mark Leonard, has maintained a low profile, declining media interviews and making few public appearances.

Federal level  On the federal level the Richterwahlausschuss elects the federal judges (Bundesrichter) to the federal courts (Bundesgericht), like e.g. the federal tribunal (Bundesgerichtshof - BGH), the federal labor court (Bundesarbeitsgericht - BAG), the federal administrative court (Bundesverwaltungsgericht - BVerwG), the federal tax court (Bundesfinanzhof - BFH), the federal social court (Bundessozialgericht - BSG), and the federal patent court (Bundespatentgericht - BPatG). The source of law for the federal Richterwahlausschuss is Art. 95 Sec. 2 of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz - GG), The Act on Electing Judges (Richterwahlgesetz - RiWG), and The Act on Judges (Deutsches Richtergesetz - DRiG). Members of the Richterwahlausschluss are the sixteen ministers of justice of the German (in some states called senators) and sixteen further members which are chosen by the lower house of the German parliament (Bundestag - BT). Members of the Richterwahlausschuss do not have to be judges themselves, and usually they are not. Judges of the Federal Constitutional Tribunal (Bundesverfassungsgericht BVerfG) are elected according to Art. 94 of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz - GG) by the federal parliament without the involvement of the Richterwahlausschuss. = Procedure of electing judges = Candidates for the federal judges are chosen by the federal minister of justice (Bundesjustizminister) or the Richterwahlausschuss. Non-binding opinions of the candidates are issued by the governing body of the court, in which the candidate is supposed to work, vide ¬ß 57 DRiG. The federal minister of justice then sends the file of the candidate to the Richterwahlausschuss. The Richterwahlausschuss makes the decision in a secret ballot with a simple majority of the votes cast. If the federal minister of justice approves the chosen candidate, (s)he applies to the federal president (Bundespr√§sident) to appoint the chosen candidate as a judge. The federal president together with the federal chancellor (Bundeskanzler) or the federal minister of justice appoints the judge.  State level  In five states the election and appointment of judges is taking place only within the state ministries of justice without the involvement of a Richterwahlausschuss. * According to Art. 51 Sec. 3 of the Constitution of Lower Saxony a Richterwahlausschuss may be installed. It has not been installed so far. * According to Art. 79 Sec. 3 of the Constitution of Saxony a Richterwahlausschuss may be installed. It has not been installed so far. * According to Art. 83 Sec. 4 of the Constitution of Saxony-Anhalt a Richterwahlausschuss may be installed. * North Rhine-Westphalia and Saarland do not have a Richterwahlausschuss. Eleven states do have a Richterwahlausschuss. Its capacity is different in every state: = Baden- W√ºrttemberg = The election and appointment of judges is taking place only within the state ministry of justice without the involvement of a Richterwahlausschuss. However, if the governing body of the court in question rejects the chosen candidate, a Richterwahlausschuss is appointed to solve the conflict. = Bavaria = The election and appointment of judges is taking place only within the state ministry of justice without the involvement of a Richterwahlausschuss. There is a Richter-Wahl-Kommission which only elects the judges to the Bavarian Constitutional Tribunal (Bayerischen Verfassungsgerichtshofes - BayVerfGH). Members of the Richter-Wahl-Kommission are the speaker of the Bavarian parliament and nine of its members. = Berlin = Richterwahlausschuss has 14 members of which eight are chosen by the Berlin parliament. = Brandenburg = Richterwahlausschuss has 12 members of which eight are chosen by the Brandenburg parliament. = Bremen = Richterwahlausschuss has 11 members of which five are chosen by the Bremen parliament. = Hamburg = Richterwahlausschuss has 14 members of which nine are members of the Hamburg parliament, vide Art. 63 of the Constitution of Hamburg. = Hesse = Richterwahlausschuss has 13 members of which seven are members of the Hessian parliament, vide Art. 127 Sec. 3 of the Constitution of Hesse. = Mecklenburg-West Pomerania = There is a Richterwahlausschuss, vide Art. 76 Sec. 3 of the Constitution of Hamburg. = Rhineland-Palatinate = Richterwahlausschuss has 11 members of which eight are members of the Rhineland-Palatinate parliament, vide Art. 102 of the Constitution of Rhineland-Palatinate. = Schleswig-Holstein = There is a Richterwahlausschuss with 2/3 of its members being members of the Schleswig- Holstein parliament, vide Art. 43 of the Constitution of Schleswig-Holstein. = Thuringia = Richterwahlausschuss has 12 members of which eight are members of the Thuringian parliament, Art. 89 Sec. 2 of the Constitution of Thuringia.  Legitimation chain theory  According to the understanding of democracy in the German legal doctrine (Demokratieprinzip), every government authority, also the judiciary, has to be traced back to the people by an uninterrupted chain of democratic legitimation (demokratische Legitimationskette). In accordance with this doctrine judges need to be appointed either directly by the people or by a representative of the people chosen in an election, e.g. by the parliament, the minister appointed by the parliament, a person appointed by the minister. The bigger the amount of chain links between the election by the people and the election of the judge, the weaker is the democratic legitimation.

The show's tagline is \\"A Star Trek podcast by two guys who are a little bit embarrassed to have a Star Trek Podcast.\\" The show started on January 25, 2016, and after 30 episodes joined the Maximum Fun network on May 9, 2016. The show, as of August 2018, is the highest-rated Star Trek podcast on iTunes. History and format From January 2016 to September 2017 the podcast was posted twice-weekly (on Mondays and Wednesdays), with each show reviewing an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation (where the podcast gets its name). After completing its run of The Next Generation, the show switched to once a week (Mondays) and moved on to review episodes of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine in October 2017. The podcast has a number of running gags, such as referring to the listeners as \\"viewers\\" and Pranica and Harrison parodying This Old House or impersonating the character of Kevin Uxbridge (played by John Anderson) from The Next Generation episode \\"The Survivors\\". =Maron open and review= Every show starts with a Maron Open (named after comedian Marc Maron's podcast, WTF with Marc Maron). There are a few standard opening segments including opening trading cards, reading fan mail, or \\"Bible Study\\" (where they open up the show bible and compare the plan for the show to its eventual execution). The opening for episode 152 (which was published on July 10, 2017 and reviewed \\"Descent, part II\\") featured Pranica and Harrison interviewing LeVar Burton, who portrayed Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge in The Next Generation. Following the Maron Open, Pranica and Harrison give a walk- through of the selected Star Trek episode scene by scene, followed by a review. Pranica and Harrison, both of whom have professional video production experience, use their knowledge of cinematography to provide commentary on the show, offering insight into some of the aspects of Star Trek while also pointing out some of the areas where it could be better. Using their experience, they critique the show's sets, special effects, acting, hairstyles, writing, and directing. =Drunk Shimoda= After the review of the episode, Pranica and Harrison designate their \\"Drunk Shimoda\\" for that episode, which is the character or actor (or in some cases TV crew member) having the most fun or just being the silliest in the episode. The term \\"Drunk Shimoda\\" is a reference to the second episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, \\"The Naked Now,\\" in which assistant chief engineer Jim Shimoda is inebriated by a virus and removes all of the isolinear chips from the engine control station. =Episode vetoes= At the end of each episode, Harrison reads the preview for the next episode they are to review from Amazon and Netflix. During their reviews of The Next Generation, Pranica and Harrison each had the chance to veto one episode per season of The Next Generation, meaning they would skip that episode and review the one after instead. However, the vetoes could be nullified if the other host chose to use their veto to counter the decision, which is what happened every time the vetoes were used. In Season 1 Pranica vetoed \\"Haven\\" because it featured Lwaxana Troi, but this was nullified by Harrison. In Season 2 Harrison attempted to veto the episode ‚ÄúUp the Long Ladder,‚Äù but Pranica nullified as he felt they should watch a low quality episode. In Season 3 Harrison described \\"The Ensigns of Command\\" as one of his favorite episodes, leading Pranica to veto it and forcing Harrison to counter-veto. In Season 4 Harrison vetoed ‚ÄúRemember Me\\", describing it as \\"a turkey\\", but Pranica nullified. In Season 5 Harrison attempted to veto ‚ÄúNew Ground\\", incorrectly thinking it featured Lwaxana Troi, but Pranica nullified as he felt Harrison was \\"vetoing blind\\". In Season 6 Pranica vetoed \\"Rascals\\" (in which four adult characters are turned into 12-year-old children) stating he was \\"anti-kids\\", Harrison countered because he liked the episode and thought it needed a second chance. In Season 7 Pranica attempted to veto \\"Dark Page\\", again because it featured Lwaxana Troi, but Harrison countered it because he did not have detailed intelligence about the episode. =Board game= As Pranica and Harrison's knowledge of Deep Space Nine was not as strong as it was for The Next Generation, instead of vetoes, for the last fifteen episodes of the first season of Deep Space Nine, Harrison rolled a virtual die. If they rolled a 1 (out of a potential 1 thru 15), they would have to be drunk for that episode, something they achieved twice. From the second season onward, Pranica and Harrison created a Snakes and Ladders style board game called \\"Game of Buttholes: The Will Of the Prophets \\". At the end of each episode the virtual die is rolled and Pranica and Harrison advance as many spaces on the board, resulting in either a blank tile (meaning a normal next episode) or an action tile containing a theme for the next episode. There are 100 tiles out of which 76 are blank, 18 are action tiles and 6 are Bajoran Wormholes (meaning they would move to a lower part of the board, the equivalent of snakes in Snakes and Ladders). The action tile themes are: * Quark's Bar: A \\"Drunkisode\\", where Pranica and Harrison have to be drunk recording the show (9 tiles) * CoCo NoNo: A tiki-themed Drunkisode * Mornhammered: Power Hour, where Pranica and Harrison have to take a one shot of beer every minute while recording * Starship Mine: Where Pranica and Harrison have to build a spaceship model while recording the show * Caught in the Nebula: Where Pranica and Harrison have no notes and cannot scroll through the episode while recording * The Nth Degree: Where Pranica and Harrison have to undertake extensive research about the episode * Measure of a Man: Pranica and Harrison flip a coin at the start of the recording and then vehemently argue the pros and cons of the episode depending on the result of the coin toss * The Naked Now: Pranica and Harrison record the show in a bathtub * Looking At Each Other During: One host has to fly to the other host's city and record in-person * Fuck It, We'll Do It Live!: Livestream the recording session The Greatest Discovery In 2017 Pranica and Harrison started a new podcast, The Greatest Discovery, following the launch of Star Trek: Discovery. It was billed as \\"the unofficial, irreverent and filthy aftershow Discovery didn't know it needed.\\" The podcast, which is released the Tuesday after a new episode of Star Trek: Discovery is aired, reviews each episode in the same format as The Greatest Generation. When Star Trek: Discovery is off the air, the podcast is released monthly with Pranica and Harrison discussing Star Trek related news, interviewing guests and reviewing other Star Trek media related to Star Trek: Discovery, such as comics and specific episodes of The Original Series. Guests featured on The Greatest Discovery include Anson Mount, J. K. Woodward and Chris Black. Following the launch of Short Treks and the announcement of Star Trek: Picard, Pranica and Harrison announced that The Greatest Discovery would be used to review all upcoming Star Trek television properties, including Short Treks, Picard and Lower Decks, in addition to Discovery. Reception On February 14, 2016 arsTechnica published a review of the podcast titled \\"If you grew up watching ST:TNG, then you'll love this new podcast.\\" On July 29, 2016, Slate's Sarah Archer offered a review of the podcast noting that the \\"show has lost a few listeners thanks to their willingness to bust the show's chops, other listeners (like me) delight in their clear affection for it and their admiration for its progressive ideals.\\" Archer also stated the podcast was \\"more Mystery Science Theater 3000 than Comic-Con.\\" References  External links  * 2016 podcast debuts Audio podcasts Comedy and humor podcasts Film and television podcasts Maximum Fun Star Trek fandom ","title":"The Greatest Generation (podcast)"},{"id":"55924160","text":"from Louisa Knightleys 1915 book The journals of Lady Knightley of Fawsley Louisa Mary Knightley, Lady Knightley (25 April 1842 - 2 October 1913) was a British Anglican and women's rights activist. Life Born on Lower Grosvenor Street in London as Louisa Bowater, she was the daughter of General Edward Bowater and Emilia Mary Barne. She was educated at home and kept a diary from the age of fourteen. The family were close to the British Royal Family, and Louisa was a lady-in-waiting at the marriage of Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany and Princess Helena of Waldeck and Pyrmont. In 1869, she married Rainald Knightley, a Conservative Party Member of Parliament twenty-three years her senior. Knightley devoted much of her time to the church, serving as a national vice-president and the Peterborough diocese president of the Girls' Friendly Society. She was also a founding committee member of the Working Ladies Guild. She was also interest in politics, and when the Primrose League was established in 1883, she soon joined, and from 1885 until 1907, she served on its Ladies' Grand Council. In line with the organisation's aims, she was very active in mobilising women in support of the Conservative Party, and was credited with saving Rainald's seat in the 1885 and 1886 UK general elections. The experience of involvement in an election campaign without being able to vote convinced her of the case for women's suffrage. In about 1888, she was elected to the parish council of Badby, Northamptonshire, and later chaired the body. Probably due to Louisa's lobbying, Rainald was created Baron Knightley in 1892, Louisa therefore becoming Lady Knightley. Rainald died in 1895, and Louisa thereafter devoted more of her time to women's rights. She was a founder member of the National Union of Women Workers, serving as a vice-president from 1906, also serving on the committee of the Freedom of Labour Defence League, and as president of the Northamptonshire Society for Promoting the Return of Women as Poor Law Guardians. Knightley was also active in support of imperialism, serving as president of the South African Colonisation Society, and editing the Imperial Colonist journal from 1901 to 1913. In her last years, she also served on the Northamptonshire Higher Education Committee, and from 1908 to 1910 was the founding president of the Conservative and Unionist Women's Franchise Association. Lady Knightley was appointed a Lady of Grace of the Order of St John of Jerusalem on 7 March 1900.

In 1913 she volunteered her services to the Women's Social and Political Union and was initially warning against getting arrested. She learnt about politics by chairing and talking at WSPU meetings across County Durham. She tried to set alight a pier of Durham Cathedral but failed. She later committed what she called the \\"perfect crime\\". In 1914 she burnt down a railway building at Esh Winning. She had designed a system where a jar of flammable liquid was set alight when a candle burnt down. This meant that by the time the wooden building was alight she was miles away establishing an alibi. She was also lucky to have the assistance of a miner named Joss Craddock. They had met and they had worked together at meetings where he could hold back the stewards whilst she made her point. This meant that Lewcock avoided the bruises she used to get before they met. The railway building at Esh Winning burnt down but the Police could not make formal charges as she had over thirty witnesses who could testify that she was with them at the time of the fire. However her employers did not need proof and she was told that she must stop her political actions or give up teaching. She gave up teaching, but this was just as suffragette activity disappeared. That year the WSPU agreed a truce with the government for the period of the war. Lewcock increased her activities for the Independent Labour Party. From 1960 she represented the Benwell ward on Newcastle city council. She was w awarded an OBE in the New Years Honours List in 1966 and she ceased being a councillor in 1971. In 1978 she was asked to come to Westminster Hall where leading politicians were leading celebrations of the suffragists achievements as it was fifty years since all women had the right to vote.

There is no definite evidence of what the properties were used for, but at least some of them were likely to have been hotels or boardinghouses.Candlin & Pybus (2015), p. 89. =Slaves= As was common for free blacks, Ostrehan dealt in slaves herself once she had the means to do so. Some of the people she owned were family members, including her mother and probably her siblings ‚Äì she \\"clearly felt that personal ownership of her family members was the safest option in a society ruled by private property\\".Candlin & Pybus (2015), p. 83. Others she purchased solely in order to free. Barbados had extremely strict manumission laws at the time, which had been imposed in order to limit the number of free blacks on the island. Owners had to pay ¬£200 for male slaves and ¬£300 for female slaves, and also had to show cause to the local authorities.Candlin & Pybus (2015), p. 80. It was often cheaper to manumit in other colonies, and Ostrehan assisted manumissions in Grenada, Dominica, and Berbice at various times. She also used agents to manumit family members, like her mother and niece Elizabeth Swain Bannister, in London.Candlin & Pybus (2015), p. 92. However, a number of her slaves were kept simply to work on her properties, and no attempts to free them were made before her death. Death and estate By the time of her death in late 1809, Ostrehan's wealth was concentrated in \\"two very large houses\\" in Bridgetown, which were valued at a combined total of ¬£2,850. The total value of her estate was around ¬£4,000, which included several smaller properties, household effects (mahogany furniture, silverware, porcelain), and thirteen slaves. Ostrehan had no children of her own, and willed most of her fortune to her two nieces, Mary and Susannah II.Candlin & Pybus (2015), p. 90. Her mother was still enslaved at the time of her death, and thus unable to inherit property; she was willed to a friend, Christian Blackman, with instructions to free her and provide her a house.Candlin & Pybus (2015), p. 82. Four white acquaintances received ¬£100 each, demonstrating the extent of her connections in Barbadian society. Ostrehan's nieces carried on the same line of business, operating hotels in the new colonies of Demerara and Berbice; Susannah II continued to own slaves up until the abolition of slavery in 1833, and received compensation for her loss.Candlin & Pybus (2015), p. 99.

The company has partnerships with Novartis and Regeneron.  History  Intellia Therapeutics was founded in May 2014 to develop biopharmaceuticals using CRISPR. It was backed by Atlas Venture and Novartis; the founding CEO was Nessan Bermingham from Atlas and the founding CSO was John Leonard, formerly CSO of AbbVie. The academic scientists involved in the founding included Rodolphe Barrangou, Rachel Haurwitz, Luciano Marraffini, Eric Sontheimer, and Derrick Rossi. The intellectual property around CRISPR was contested from the beginning; Intellia in-licensed patents from Caribou Biosciences, which had licensed patents from University of California invented by Jennifer Doudna. Note - the article's second page appears here. Novartis had funded the Series A round because of its interest in applying CRISPR in CAR-T, and in January 2015 Novartis and Intellia reached a deal through which Novartis obtained rights to use CRISPR for its CAR-T program, and the companies agreed to collaborate on ways to use CRISPR to treat diseases involving hematopoietic stem cells including beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease. Note - the second page of the article appears here. Intellia formed a division called eXtellia Therapeutics to manage the CAR-T collaboration with Novartis. As of February 2015, Intellia's competitors included CRISPR Therapeutics (with IP invented by Emmanuelle Charpentier), Editas Medicine (with IP invented by Feng Zhang from the Broad Institute) and Horizon Discovery. Among large pharmaceutical companies, AstraZeneca had the broadest set of collaborations in CRISPR. In April 2017 Intellia entered into a partnership with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals under which Regeneron gained the exclusive right to use Intellia's CRISPR platform on up to 10 drug targets, of which up to five could be outside of the liver, and the companies agreed to co-develop other targets. Regeneron paid $75 million upfront, as well as milestones and royalties. The company said it planned to put $10 million of the funds into its bioinformatics program, to help it evaluate targets. In December 2016, the company moved to its new 80,000 sq. ft. laboratory and office space in Cambridge, Massachusetts. By that time, it had in-licensed a lipid nanoparticle drug delivery system to help with its efforts to deliver its CRISPR drugs to the liver, without being degraded in the bloodstream; at that time it had not disclosed the licensor. In March 2017 Intellia and Regeneron, its partner in co-developing a CRISPR-based treatment for transthyretin amyloidosis, presented data from a gene editing experiment in mice. By that time, University of California had lost a challenge to Broad's CRISPR patents, putting Intellia at a disadvantage relative to Editas. In December 2017 Leonard, who had experience in drug development, took over as CEO. In October 2019, Intellia named Glenn Goddard as its executive vice president and CFO. Prior to Intellia, Goddard was the CFO at Generation Bio Company and senior vice president of finance at Agios Pharmaceuticals. Funding In November 2014, Intellia Therapeutics raised $15 million in Series A round. In September 2015, a Series B round secured $70 million. In May 2016, Intellia announced the closing of its initial public offering which raised approximately $112.1 million. In the course of going public, the company disclosed that it had licensed the lipid drug delivery system from Novartis, and that it involved creating lipid droplets to encapsulate the CRISPR agents.

She is an expert on parenting practices and the influence of parent-child social interaction on language, cognitive, and social development. She has co-edited numerous volumes on parenting and early child development including the Handbook of Father Involvement: Multidisciplinary Perspectives (with Natasha J. Cabrera) and Child Psychology: A Handbook of Contemporary Issues (with Lawrence Balter) and Gender Roles in Immigrant Families (with Susan Chuang). Tamis-LeMonda is a Fellow of the Association for Psychological Science. She has served as an expert consultant on infant and child development for The New York Times, Discovery Channel, American Baby magazine, Scientific American, and The Wall Street Journal. She serves as an associate editor of the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General and Infancy.  Biography  Tamis-LeMonda graduated magna cum laude with her Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology from New York University (NYU) in 1983. She went on to complete her PhD in experimental psychology with a concentration in developmental psychology at NYU in 1987, working under the supervision of Marc Bornstein. She joined the faculty of the Department of Applied Psychology at NYU Steinhardt in 1991 and was promoted to full professor in 2002. Tamis-LeMonda has received multiple grants for her research on parenting, child development, and school success from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institute of Mental Health, the Ford Foundation, the Robin Hood Foundation, and the National Science Foundation. She serves as an appointed member of the Committee on Fostering School Success for English Learners: Toward New Directions in Policy, Practice, and Research of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.  Research  Tamis-LeMonda's research program examines the impact of parental involvement on children's language and cognitive skills. Her early work emphasized sensitive and responsive parenting (i.e., maternal sensitivity), defined as the ability to perceive and infer infants' communicative intentions and respond to them appropriately, as a crucial factor promoting children's language development. In later studies, Tamis-LeMonda and colleagues examined the involvement of fathers as well as mothers in their children's development. An especially influential paper titled Fatherhood in the Twenty-First Century discussed the impact of various factors that influence children's upbringing, such as women's contributions to the labor force, the role of fathers in families where both parents reside at home, the detachment and distance of fathers who do not reside with their children, and cultural diversity in parenting practices. Tamis-LeMonda has been involved in many large-scale longitudinal studies of children growing up in low-income families, including the Early Head Start Research and Evaluation Project. One of Tamis-LeMonda's more recent studies examined longitudinal relationships between the early learning environments of toddlers assessed at 14 months, 2 and 3 years and their academic skills at 5th grade. The study found mothers‚Äô engagement with their toddlers in book reading and conversation and the provision of developmentally appropriate learning materials to be strong predictors of children's subsequent cognitive development and school success. This study also documented adverse effects of stress associated with single parenting, teenage parenting, and financial hardship on children's academic success.

She was later promoted to the rank of brigadier- general and in doing so became the first female general in West Africa. Kale was promoted to major-general in 1994 and became the first Nigerian woman to achieve that rank. She was also the first female major-general in West Africa. Her role was initially as chief psychiatrist to the army. Kale later became director of the entire Nigerian Medical Corps and was its Chief Medical Officer until 1996. This was the first time in the history of the Nigerian Army that a woman was given responsibility for the healthcare of all Nigerian soldiers at all levels in preparation for and during war. She retired in 1997. Personal life Kale's father was a pharmacist and her mother a teacher and they ensured she had a good education.

The particular naval base of Peru-nefer was one of the bases established in the Eighteenth Dynasty of the New Kingdom of Egypt. Perunefer is, according to Manfred Biatek, identified with Tell el-Daba/ Ezbet Helmy. Support for this theory comes from excavations and digs that were conducted around the area the naval base was believed to be.  Overview  The pharaohs believed to be responsible for this 18th Dynasty naval base are Tuthmosis III and Amenhotep II, located near the Nile Delta. According to Labib Habachi's research, Perunefer was located at Tell el-Daba and Qantir, which he identified with Avaris/Piramesse. These identifications were proved by the excavations of the Austrian Institute and the Pelizaeus Museum, Hildesheim respectively. Although this information is provided, no Eighteenth Dynasty remains were missing from the site. When military installations were made from the Eighteenth Dynasty, evidence was found in Perunefer's favor. Detailed work from Tuthmosis III and Amenhotep II were found in the form of paintings. These paintings were later to be known as the Minoan wall paintings. Along with these recent discoveries, two large harbor basins were found. Jean-Phiippe Goiran and Herv√© Tronch√®re were the paleogeographers who found the evidence of the two harbours. These two men were specialists in the study of ancient harbours, and had access via the canals to the harbours. According to their evidence, they make the assumption that Perunefer accommodated hundreds of ships in the eighteenth dynasty. The first harbour was hard to date, but early evidence pointed to the time of Horemheb. Horemheb created a project to build a wall which covered access to the canal which was examined. The second harbor was just beside a recently discovered Hyksos palace, probably belonging to Khyan, which hints at its date. It was found in a strange spot of the Nile channel, which was believed to have a seasonal lake from time to time. On the stela of King Kamos of the Seventeenth Dynasty, he mentions destroying hundreds of ships in a large basin, which leads us to believe that our second harbor of Perunefer would be located here. The significance of Perunefer goes slightly beyond the Eighteenth Dynasty though. The harbours were still in use during the Nineteenth Dynasty, according to Papyrus Anastasi III. An interesting fact about these particular harbours of Perunefer was that some evidence points to the fact that these were the basins in use around the time of the biblical character of Moses. The palaces involved and some of the pottery found were excavated around this area, and Tuthmosis III and Amenhotep II are mentioned along with that. Biatek actually was one of the historians involved with this project, and uncovered an even more interesting find. A pot was found that some believe was the pot that Moses could have used during that time. Perunefer is very obscure and there is not much information about this ancient naval base. The Egyptians and their leaders found Perunefer to be of importance, and it continued to thrive. All of the historic information of the naval base is primarily covered by the historian, Manfred Bietak, University of Vienna. In one of his most recent articles about Perunefer, he discusses more about the Minoan paintings and just how pharaonic Perunefer was. When the Austrian Archaeological Institute dug the site of Tell el-Daba, as discussed earlier, it was revealed that the site spanned thirteen acres. Two palaces were located on this land which had a unique taste. The Minoans used a lot of symbolism involving the bull. The bull shows up many times in these palaces and paintings, which were of high quality. According to Biatek, the existence of the hitherto enigmatic palace complexes were supported by the discovery. Keftiu ships were also found to be docked at Perunefer as according to the British Museum Papyrus 10056. The location of Perunefer is believed to be at the site of Tell el-Daba. Tell el-Daba is located on the East end of the Nile River on the Delta. The map above shows the alleged location of Tell el-Daba, and the believed to be location of the naval base, Perunefer. Other ports‚Äô locations are also given on this map, and it seems as if Perunefer had one of the more desirable locations than nearly all of them. The other ports and their harbours are located out of the way of the Nile and more East than the Delta. Perunefer appears to be right on the Nile, and shows to be a good location for trade and a great location for civilizations to reside. Perunefer is much more significant than the average port. This important naval base was used by two well known pharaohs and in use throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties. Manfred Biatek and other smaller historians helped to bring Perunefer to others, but it seems as if it didn't catch on. The Minoans, Egyptians, Moses, and many others are involved in the history of Perunefer.  References  *Kingdom Naval Base,\\" Egyptian Archaeology 34 (2009), 15-17.  Manfred Bietak - Academia.edu.

The program consists of six men, who are gradually eliminated from the competition by Trump. The program was announced in September 2004, with its premiere scheduled for that fall on Fox, before being changed to January 2005. The program did not air as scheduled, and Fox later confirmed that it had shelved the project. Oxygen acquired the program from Fox in February 2006, and broadcast it on April 29, 2006. Overview Ivana Young Man is hosted by Ivana Trump, who aids 40-year-old Kathy Dahl in finding a younger man. Dahl is a wealthy divorced mother from Minnesota. Trump chooses six men, ages 22 to 32, for Dahl to choose among. Trump also offers her advice to Dahl. The men perform several intellectual and physical challenges over the course of several days, including rock climbing. At the end of each day, after a challenge, one of the men is chosen by Dahl to join her in a hotel room so they can spend time together. The men are gradually eliminated from the competition by Trump, who tells them, \\"You're not desired.\\" Jeff Lindell, a model, won the competition. Trump's younger boyfriend, 32-year-old Italian dancer and model Rossano Rubicondi, appears as one of the six men. For the program, he was given the name of Paulo, to keep his identity secretive from the other men. Dahl was made aware of Rubicondi's true identity, and he served as an informant to her regarding the other men. Production and broadcast Ivana Young Man was announced in September 2004. Casting had already begun at that time, and the program was initially scheduled to air on Fox later that fall. Scott Stone, Sharon Levy and Anthony Ross were executive producers for the project. Stone devised the idea for the program while going up a ski slope, saying \\"It was in the zeitgeist, with Demi and Ashton, and Madonna and Guy Ritchie. And I have a lot of female friends always looking for me to help find men for them, but the men their own age are (sometimes) intimidated by their success.\\" Stone then discussed the program with Trump, who enjoyed the idea of hosting it. Stone said, \\"The reason we went to Ivana for this show is she is the prototype for this type of relationship.\\" Stone also said, \\"We really matched the guys up with Kathy's interests. We wanted to give her the gamut. We have kind of the all-American hunky quarterback-looking guy. We got the quirky, funny, great-sense-of-humor guy and we got the hot European sexy guy.\\" Thousands of men auditioned to be on the program. Filming had concluded by November 2004, after seven days of shooting in Manhattan, and the program was scheduled to air on Fox in January 2005, with the potential to become a regular series. However, the program did not premiere on its scheduled air date. In August 2005, Fox confirmed that the project had been shelved with no plans to air it. A reason was not disclosed for the decision. Trump said she did not know why the project was shelved. Stone said that Fox had not definitively ruled out broadcasting the program, but that such a possibility was unlikely. Stone also said that if the program did not air on Fox, \\"I will do everything in my power to see that it airs somewhere else.\\" Stone further stated that he and Trump were satisfied with the program. Oxygen acquired the program from Fox in February 2006, and premiered it in the United States on April 29, 2006. Ivana Trump said she did not care about suggestions that she was trying to compete with her ex-husband's reality television series, The Apprentice.

Schulman (born 1941) is an American-Israeli physicist known for his work on path integrals, quantum measurement theory and statistical mechanics. He introduced topology into path integrals on multiply connected spaces and has contributed to diverse areas from galactic morphology to the arrow of time.  Biography  He was born to Anna and Louis Schulman in Newark, New Jersey, USA. He first went to the local public school, but switched to more Jewish oriented institutions, graduating from Yeshiva University in 1963. While still in college he married Claire Frangles Sherman. From Yeshiva he went to Princeton where he received the Ph.D. in physics for his thesis (under Arthur Wightman) A path integral for spin. After completing his thesis he took a position as Assistant Professor at Indiana University (Bloomington), but in 1970 went to the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa on a NATO postdoctoral fellowship. At the Technion he accepted a position as Associate Professor, but only resigned from Indiana several years later as Professor. In 1985 he returned to the United States as Chair of the Physics Department of Clarkson University and eventually (1988) also resigned from the Technion (as full Professor). In 1991 he left the chair-ship and since then has stayed on at Clarkson as professor of physics. In 2013 he spent part of a sabbatical at Georgia Institute of Technology and has since been adjunct professor at that institution. Visiting positions, honors, etc.: See the . Of particular mention is his relation to the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems (Dresden), where he has been a frequent visitor since being awarded the Gutzwiller fellowship in 2005. He is the father of Leonard Schulman, noted Computer Science professor at the California Institute of Technology and David Schulman, an intellectual property attorney at the law firm of Greenberg Traurig, LLP.  Scientific activities  The foray into topology led to topological views of other phenomena in physics, for example an alternative phrasing of the Aharonov-Bohm effect. Together with Phil Seiden (of IBM) he began the first studies of randomized cellular automata, an area that morphed into a theory of star formation in galaxies, once they were joined by Humberto Gerola (an astrophysicist at IBM) who realized that star formation regions - as well as epidemic models- could be viewed as random cellular automata. Besides providing an explanation for spiral arms, this work ultimately solved the mystery of why dwarf galaxies can vary in their luminosity by large factors. In 1981 Schulman published Techniques and Applications of Path Integration, from which many physicists learned about Feynman's path integral and its many applications. The book went on to become a Wiley classic and in 2005 came out in a Dover edition (with a supplement). Once Schulman proved that (contrary to published work) there was no infinite cluster for long-range percolation in one dimension for sufficiently small but non-zero connection probability, it became of interest whether for sufficiently large connection probability there was an infinite cluster. Together with Charles Newman (then of Univ. Arizona) they used rigorous real- space renormalization methods to prove that indeed there was. About this time, Schulman lowered his Erd√∂s number to two by collaborating with Marc Kac (and others) on Feynman's checkerboard path integral, realizing that a particle only acquires mass by scattering, reversing its speed-of-light propagation. Later the path to Erd√∂s was reinforced by another collaboration, with his son Leonard, whose Erd√∂s number is also one. Quantum measurement had always seemed an oxymoron and in the 1980s Schulman conceived of a way to retain unitary time evolution while at the same time having a single \\"world\\" (in the sense of the many worlds interpretation). So measurements in quantum mechanics could yield definite results. The mechanism for achieving definite outcomes was the use of \\"special states\\" in which pure unitary evolution led to only a single outcome, when in the absence of special initial conditions many outcomes were conceivable. The need for those states at all times led to an examination of the arrow of time and of determinism (achieved here, but in a way that might have surprised Einstein, at least according to his collaborator - and Schulman's Technion colleague - Nathan Rosen). These ideas have not been accepted in the mainstream of physics and Schulman himself has expressed doubts about them - his claim though is that other ideas on the quantum measurement process are even less believable. As of 1997, the work was summarized in a book, Time's arrows and quantum measurement. Despite the apparent finality of book publication, more than a decade later practical experimental tests of these ideas were conceived and published. The arrow of time, of significance in the measurement problem, became a topic in and of itself. This goes back to Schulman's attempt to understand the Wheeler-Feynman absorber theory. Using similar tools he was able to demonstrate that two systems with opposite arrows of time could coexist, even with mild contact between them. There was also examination of other ideas on the arrow, including Thomas Gold's contribution (relating the thermodynamic arrow to the expansion of the universe) and a critique of Boltzmann's notions (now known as Boltzmann's Brain) as a form of solipsism. See Schulman's critique on page 154 of. For a while Schulman was interested in the quantum Zeno effect, the deviation from exponential decay for short times. He predicted that the slowdown in decay that occurred in pulsed observation and the slowdown resulting from continuous measurement would differ by a factor of 4. This was verified on Bose-Einstein condensates by a group at MIT. Schulman has also contributed to very practical matters through his collaboration with a group in Prague interested in luminescence and scintillators. This was first realized in a study anomalous decay caused by KAM tori in phase space (and the associated data fits) and more recently has led to studies of quantum tunneling. When funds were available undergraduate students from Clarkson were sent to Prague to work in the optical materials laboratories. Together with Bernard Gaveau (University of Paris VI) Schulman developed an embedding of a stochastic dynamical system in low dimensional Euclidean space, known as the \\"observable representation.\\" This has proved useful in numerous areas from spin-glasses to ecology.

French Le Journal illustr√© named her \\"the greatest tragedy performer in all of Slavic South\\". Early life and singing career Marija Terezija Ru≈æiƒçka was born on 3 August 1850 in a Moravian town of Litovel to Leopold R≈Ø≈æiƒçka and Terezija Mauler. When Strozzi was four months old, actor Josip Freudenreich recommended her father to Dimitrija Demeter who invited him to join the Croatian National Theatre's orchestra so the family moved to Zagreb. At first, she attended German monastery school and performed for the first time in the monastery festivities. At the age of 15, she enrolled at the singing course of the Croatian Music Institute where she was trained by Vatroslav Lichtenegger. In 1878, she was trained in Burgtheater. In 1864, Strozzi performed at the Zagreb premiere of Ivan K√∂ck's operetta ≈†ere≈æanin as Clementine. In 1866, at the concert in Croatian Music Institute, she sang the soprano aria from Giuseppe Verdi's opera Nabucco. In the same time, Strozzi was preparing for the study at the Vienesse University of Music and Performing Arts but damaged the vocals (alto) and had to give up singing. She was so devastated that she wanted to commit suicide. Acting career After medical treatment, Strozzi started taking private acting lessons from Josip Freudenreich, as recommended by Dimitrija Demeter. On 2 January 1868, she debuted in the Croatian National Theatre (HNK) as Jeane d'Eyre in the Charlotte Birch-Pfeiffer's drama Orphan of Lowood. On 17 February, she got permanent employment at HNK, at first playing sentimental naive girls and women, and girls and women in conversational cheerful games, occasionally performing in operas and operettas. Gradually, she played more complex characters from classical comedies, tragedies, civil dramas and conversational pieces. Her inseparable partner was Andrija Fijan with whom she performed in thirty-three seasons and performed in some of her major roles between 1880 and 1910. She performed in theaters in Dubrovnik, Pazin, Pula, Rijeka, Split, Zadar, Trieste, Brno, Sofia and Prague. Before the performance in Zadar, members of the Autonomist Party threatened her with a murder if she spoke Croatian on the stage which she ignored. She was also translating plays from Italian, Czech, and French into Croatian. Private life Marija Ru≈æiƒçka Strozzi married marquess Ferdinand de Strozzi on 20 February 1871. Her husband was a member of the old Florentine noble family. Strozzi's were the largest Croatian art dynasty. Couple had 8 children, 5 of which died of diphtheria and tuberculosis shortly after they were born so only three survived into adulthood, one of which died in the First World War. When her son Tito wanted to leave Zagreb and start building a career in Vienna, just before the First World War, she wrote to him: \\"Tito, you, as a Croat, intend to leave your homeland so relentlessly?\\" She was an honorary member of the Brethren of the Croatian Dragon, National Theater in Prague and Yugoslav-Czechoslovakian League. In 1928, President Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk awarded her the Order of the White Lion.

Georges Charpentier (December 22, 1846 - November 15, 1905) was a 19th-century French publisher who became known as a champion of naturalist writers, especially √âmile Zola, Gustave Flaubert, and Guy de Maupassant. He also promoted Impressionist painters and together with his wife, Marguerite Charpentier, built a small but significant art collection. Publishing house Georges Charpentier was the son of Gervais Charpentier, a French bookseller and publisher. After spending a few years a journalist, he took over his father's publishing house, Biblioth√®que Charpentier, in 1872 and began to publish adventurous contemporary authors, especially those known as proponents of naturalism. Besides Zola, Flaubert, and de Maupassant, his firm's author list included Joris-Karl Huysmans, Edmond de Goncourt, and (continuing from his father's day) Th√©ophile Gautier. In 1876 he created the Petite Biblioth√®que Charpentier, a line of affordable editions illustrated with etchings that were targeted at bibliophiles. Despite the success of Zola's and Flaubert's books in the mid 1870s, Charpentier's firm ran into financial difficulties. This state of affairs worsened when Charpentier launched a new illustrated newspaper, La Vie moderne (1879-1883) with √âmile Bergerat as managing editor and Pierre-Auguste Renoir as one of the illustrators. In 1883-84, Charles Marpon and Ernest Flammarion acquired a three-quarters interest in the firm. As more changes of ownership took place over the next decade, the firm's publications declined in number and authors moved on to other publishers. Art collection Charpentier's wife, Marguerite, was a salonist whose Friday salons drew writers, artists, actors, musicians and politicians to their house. The Charpentiers were champions of Impressionism and began buying Impressionist painting in the mid 1870s. They gave a number of portrait commissions to Renoir, who in the course of the decade painted all of the family members. Renoir's portrait of Georges, Portrait of a Man (Monsieur Charpentier), painted in 1878, is in the collection of the Barnes Foundation. Praise from contemporaries :\\"[Georges Charpentier was] created for the word 'sympathetic', unless the word was invented for him\\". (Guy de Maupassant) :\\"He had the audacity to bring us in as other doors closed before us. I speak especially for myself, who was repulsed everywhere\\". (√âmile Zola) :\\"[He] had the courage to welcome the first young authors of the so-called naturalist school, and he was well rewarded since he is the editor of Mr. Zola\\".

Early life and education  Liv Lisa Fries was born on 31 October 1990 in Pankow, Berlin, Germany. She was raised in the Berlin borough of Pankow. As an exchange student, Fries studied in Beijing. In addition to her native tongue German, she speaks English, French and Mandarin. After receiving her Abitur in 2010, she enrolled again at university to study philosophy and literary science, but had to drop out as her career as an actress progressed. Career Fries wanted to become an actress when she was fourteen years old after watching L√©on: The Professional because she was impressed by Natalie Portman's performance. After making her debut in 2002, Fries has gone on to appear in almost 40 acting roles, the majority of which have come in German films and TV series such as Zurich, Add a Friend and The Wave.https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2020/03/13/babylon-berlin-liv-lisa-fries- german-actress-instagram/ Her first film role was in Atomised (2005) (German: Elementarteilchen); however, her role was cut from the film. She then appeared in 2006 with an episode of Schimanski, in which she played the female lead role. She performed in the German made-for-television film ' (2010) as an aggressive, frustrated teenager named Linda who tortures one of her peers. Fries said that during filming, she started feeling lonely and isolated, just like her character. In 2013, she starred in the German tragicomedy Zurich (original title Und morgen Mittag bin ich tot). She received wide critical acclaim for her performance as Lea, a young woman with cystic fibrosis. According to Fries, she prepared for the role by meeting with a patient with the disease, in addition to running up stairs while breathing through a straw. For her role, she was awarded the Bavarian Film Prize 2013, the Max Oph√ºls Prize, a German Film Critics Award, and the German Director's Prize. Fries received her most prominent role to date when she was cast in 2016 as Charlotte Ritter in the German prestige television show Babylon Berlin. In Babylon Berlin, Fries stars as a police stenographer from a poor background who uses her resourcefulness and connections to investigate a series of crimes in Weimar Republic-era Berlin. The first two series of the show were filmed over eight months beginning in May 2016 and released consecutively in the Autumn of 2017. Babylon Berlin has been very popular in Germany as well as with international audiences, and has elevated Fries to international prominence; Fries is considered one of Germany's upcoming stars and has been featured in many magazines. For her portrayal, Fries shares an Adolf Grimme Award with the Babylon Berlin team. The show went on a year-long production hiatus during which Fries filmed two projects; she played a recurring role in both seasons of the 2017 American TV series Counterpart, and also co-starred in the film Pr√©lude with Louis Hofmann. In late 2018, Fries began the six- month shoot for the third season of Babylon Berlin which premiered in Germany in January 2020 and arrived on Sky Atlantic on 5 March. All three series of Babylon Berlin are now sold on DVD. In June 2020 a Series Four production was underway and is expected to premier in 2021 or even early 2022.https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/1312416/Babylon-Berlin- season-4-release-date-cast-trailer-plot-when-series-4-out-Sky-Netflix  Personal life  A private person, as of 2020 Fries lives in a village in Brandenburg where her favorite hobby is horse-riding.

Born in Tring in Hertfordshire, Janes was educated at a school in Chesham before undertaking voluntary work, initially managing various clubs associated with the church in Apsley, then later as secretary of the Girls Friendly Society in St Albans and then as the volunteer matron of the Magdalen Hospital in Streatham. In 1882, Janes met Ellice Hopkins, the two being introduced by Louisa Hubbard, and worked for four years as her private secretary. Hopkins' work focused on reforming legislation regarding girls, and Janes was central to forming the Ladies' Associations for the Care of Friendless Girls, becoming its organising secretary in 1886. She toured the country, giving speeches on its behalf, and also on behalf of the National Vigilance Association. She was motivated in these efforts by a strong religious belief, holding that \\"right\\" would ultimately triumph. Janes also became the founding secretary of the Central Conference Council, a body established in 1891 by Hubbard to co-ordinate local organisations representing women workers. In addition to giving speeches and organising the body, she was editor of its journal, the Threefold Chord. In 1895, it became the core of the new National Union of Women Workers (NUWW), with Janes again as organising secretary. Janes devoted much of the remainder of her life to the NUWW, although she also found time to edit the Englishwoman's Yearbook and Directory.

Rea is a British biochemist, science writer and educator, who is currently Professor of Biology and Rebecka and Arie Belldegrun Distinguished Director of the Vagelos Program in Life Sciences & Management at the University of Pennsylvania. His major contributions as a biochemist have been in the areas of membrane transport and xenobiotic detoxification, and as a science writer and educator in understanding the intersection between the life sciences and their implementation. In 2005, he and Mark V. Pauly founded the Roy and Diana Vagelos Program in Life Sciences & Management between the School of Arts and Sciences and Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, which he continues to co-direct in his capacity as Belldegrun Distinguished Director. Rea's work on serendipity in science has been featured in The Wall Street Journal. Additionally, he has served as a subject matter expert for 'The Scientist.  Education  Rea was educated in the comprehensive school system at Gartree High School, and Beachamp Upper School, Oadby, Leicester, before receiving his BSc in Biological Sciences with First Class Honors from the University of Sussex in 1978, and his DPhil in Plant Biochemistry from the Department of Plant Sciences and Magdalen College, University of Oxford in 1982. After his doctorate, he served as an MRC Research Fellow at the John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford from 1982-1984 before joining the Department of Biology at McGill University in 1984 as a Merit Research Associate. From 1985 to 1987, he was an AFRC Research Fellow in the Department of Biology at the University of York, UK. Immediately before his appointment by the University of Pennsylvania in 1990, he was a Group Leader in the Department of Biochemistry, Rothamsted Research (formerly Institute of Arable Crops Research), UK.  Research  Rea is known for his work on vacuolar proton (H+) pumps, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, and the enzyme phytochelatin (PC) synthase. His early work on plant vacuolar H+-pumping ATPases resulted in the first definitive determination of the subunit composition of one of these enzymes and contributed to the concept of a new category of ATPases, so-called ‚ÄòV-type ATPases‚Äô (Manolson et al 1985). These studies, in turn, opened the way for biochemical and molecular investigations of these enzymes from many different sources, leading to recognition that the plant enzyme is just one example of a category of primary H+ pumps common to both plant and animal cells. Other contributions made by Rea in this specific area included elucidation of the gross topography of the V-ATPase, demonstrating that its organization is analogous to that of the F-type ATPases of ‚Äòenergy coupling‚Äô membranes (Rea et al 1987a; Rea et al 1987b), and purification of the enzyme in its entirety to establish that the holoenzyme is a 12-15 subunit, complex comprising a peripheral, nucleotide-binding V1 sector and an intrinsic, H+-conductive V0 sector (Parry et al 1989). Collectively, these discoveries provided some of the earliest evidence that V-type and F-type H+-ATPases are paralogous. When Rea entered the field of vacuolar energetics, there were indications that plant vacuolar membranes also contained H+-pumping inorganic pyrophosphatases, which he confirmed by demonstrating that the membrane-associated vacuolar inorganic pyrophosphatase (V-PPase) of plants catalyzes pyrophosphate- (PPi-) energized electrogenic H+ translocation (Rea and Poole 1985) and is both functionally and chromatographically separable from the ATP-energized V-ATPase found on the same membrane (Rea and Poole 1986; Rea and Sanders 1987). What then followed was a broad range of discoveries made by Rea‚Äôs group concerned with defining the basic organization and core catalytic capabilities of the V-PPase. These included: (1) Purification of the pump, in parallel with identification of the major subunit through its substrate-protectable covalent modification with radiolabeled ligands (Britten et al 1989); (2) Molecular cloning of the pump (AVP1) from Arabidopsis thaliana (Sarafian et al 1992), the very first V-PPase to be cloned from any source; (3) In vitro reconstitution of the transport activity of the purified pump (Britten et al 1992); (4) Definition of the pump as a new category of ion translocase, together with speculations (which were subsequently confirmed) that the D[X]7KXE motif common to both vacuolar and soluble PPases participates directly in catalysis (Rea et al 1992); (5) Heterologous expression of the pump from Arabidopsis in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), to demonstrate that the ‚Äòsubstrate-binding subunit‚Äô alone is sufficient for PPi-dependent H+-translocation (Kim et al 1994); (6) Identification of aminomethylenediphosphonate (AMDP) as a potent type-specific inhibitor of the pump from both plant and photosynthetic bacterial sources (Baykov et al 1993; Zhen et al 1994); (7) Protein chemical identification of the maleimide-reactive domain of the pump and modeling of the topology of the C-terminal half of the molecule by peptide mapping and the deployment of both membrane-permeant and membrane-impermeant maleimides (Zhen et al 1994); (8) Identification of acidic residues required for coupling PPi hydrolysis to H+-translocation by the pump (Zhen et al 1997); (9) Isolation and functional characterization of a thermostable sequence-divergent homolog from the extremophilic archaeon Pyrobaculum aerophilum (Drozdowicz et al 1999); (10) Molecular identification, isolation and functional characterization of a type II (K+-independent) version of the pump from Arabidopsis and the first demonstration that members of this pump category fall into two distinct classes (Drozdowicz et al 2000); (11) Comparative genomic analyses of V-PPases to disclose examples of this pump category in all three domains of life and confirm the notion of two paralogous series, typified by the type I and type II enzymes (Drozdowicz et al 2001); (12) Molecular isolation, functional characterization and cellular localization of a type I pump from the parasitic protist responsible for toxoplasmosis, Toxoplasma gondii (Drozdowicz et al 2002). Rea‚Äôs research on ABC transporters has largely focused on members of this superfamily from plant and fungal sources. His group, in collaboration with Dr. Dennis J. Thiele‚Äôs group (then at the University of Michigan) molecularly and biochemically defined yeast cadmium factor 1 (YCF1), a yeast (S. cerevisiae) MRP- (ABCC-) type ABC transporter to show that it catalyzes the ATP-energized vacuolar uptake of glutathione- (GS-) conjugates (Li et al 1996). This resulted in the discovery of a new pathway for heavy metal detoxification: YCF1-catalyzed vacuolar sequestration of GS-heavy metal complexes, as exemplified by the bis(glutathionato)cadmium and tris(glutathionato)arsenic complexes formed between glutathione and cadmium (Li et al 1997) and arsenic, respectively (Ghosh et al 1999). Using tools developed in the course of their studies of YCF1 for parallel screens for similar functionalities from plant sources, Rea‚Äôs group was the first to both functionally and molecularly define an ABC transporter from a vascular plant (Arabidopsis thaliana) (Lu et al 1997; Lu et al 1998). The ABC transporters identified, AtMRP1 and AtMRP2 (alias AtABCC1 and AtABCC2), were shown to be involved in the ATP-energized vacuolar sequestration and detoxification of both endogenous and exogenous toxins, largely amphipathic anions primarily in the form of GS-conjugates (Lu et al 1997; 1998; Liu et al 2001). In compiling the first complete inventory of ABC proteins from a plant source, Rea and colleagues established that these organisms allocate a substantial fraction of their genomes to members of this protein family. The genome of Arabidopsis thaliana, for instance, contains more than 130 ORFs for these proteins of which more than 100 are transmembrane proteins (S√°nchez-Fern√°ndez et al 2001; Rea 2007). This gene count far exceeds that of humans and other animals. It was Rea‚Äôs group (Vatamaniuk et al 1999) and two others (Clemens et al 1999; Ha et al 1999) that simultaneously and independently first identified genes encoding the enzyme, phytochelatin (PC) synthase responsible for the synthesis of phytochelatins (PCs) by transfer of a Œ≥-Glu-Cys unit from one thiol peptide to another or to a previously-synthesized PC for the detoxification of heavy metals. Thereafter, he and his colleagues: (1) Defined the basic catalytic mechanism and mode of activation of the enzyme by heavy metals by establishing that blocked thiols are sufficient for PC synthase-catalyzed transpeptidation of glutathione (GSH) and related thiol peptides via a substituted enzyme mechanism (Vatamanaiuk et al 2000); (2) Determined that PC synthase is a dipeptidyl transferase that forms an enzyme Œ≥-Glu-Cys acyl-intermediate during catalysis (Vatamaniuk et al (2004); (3) Demonstrated that PC synthase is a distant cousin of papain-like cysteine proteases and deploys a Cys-His-Asp catalytic triad to catalyze the dipeptidyl transferase reaction through the formation of a Œ≥-Glu-Cys-thioester intermediate (Rea et al 2004; Romanyuk et al 2006); results that were subsequently independently confirmed by crystallographic analyses of a PC synthase homolog from the cyanobacterium Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 (Vivares et al 2005; Rea 2006). One of the most surprising findings to come from the cloning of PC synthase and its equivalents from other plants and the fungus Schizosaccharomyces pombe was the discovery of a similar gene in an animal. Routine database searches disclosed a homologous single-copy gene (ce-pcs-1) in the genome of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which Rea and colleagues took a step further to demonstrate that CePCS1 is a PC synthase, and that targeted suppression of ce-pcs-1 by the double-stranded RNA interference (RNAi) technique confers a cad1-like heavy metal-hypersensitive phenotype on C. elegans (Vatamaniuk et al 2001; Vatamaniuk et al 2002). While other gene products had been inferred to contribute to heavy metal tolerance in C. elegans, CePCS1 was the first for which to a firm biochemical basis for the effects seen at the level of the whole organism was established. Rea's current research, which owes its origins to his leadership of the Vagelos Program in Life Sciences & Management, focuses on case studies of the interface between life sciences research and its implementation; the difficult transition from discovery in the laboratory to success in the market and/or toward the expansion of humanitarian efforts. Examples of such case studies are 'Statins: from fungus to pharma,‚Äô 'Ivermectin and river blindness,‚Äô 'Can skinny fat beat obesity?', and 'Metformin: out of the backwaters and into the mainstream'; four articles aimed primarily at the educated non-specialist. The book Managing Discovery: Harnessing Creativity to Drive Biomedical Innovation (2018), coauthored with Mark V. Pauly and Lawton R. Burns, which is an extension of this research effort, addresses the link between life sciences discoveries and their dependence on the investor-driven market system. It looks at how the science actually played out through the interplay of personalities, the cultures within and between academic and corporate entities, and the significance of serendipity not as a mysterious phenomenon but one intrinsic to the successes and failures of the experimental approach. With newly aggregated data and case studies, the fundamental economic underpinnings of investor-driven discovery management are considered, not as an obstacle or deficiency, but as the only means by which scientists and managers can navigate the unknowable to discover new products.  Awards  Rea has received several awards and honors for his research and educational accomplishments. His awards and honors in the research sector include the President‚Äôs Medal from the Society for Experimental Biology, UK for pioneering investigations of primary proton pumps (1990), a Cozzarelli Prize from the National Academies of Science, USA for coauthorship of a paper of outstanding scientific excellence and originality (2010), and election as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science for outstanding fundamental research discoveries on the membrane transport and detoxification of xenobiotics, and for distinguished accomplishments and creativity in science education (2013). His awards and honors in the educational sector include an Ira H. Abrams Memorial Award for Distinguished Teaching (the College of Arts and Sciences‚Äô highest teaching honor) (2009), a Christian R. and Mary F. Lindback Foundation Award for Distinguished Teaching (the University's highest teaching honor) (2014), the Department of Biology‚Äôs Award for Excellence in Teaching (1996, 2005, 2013, 2019), and a Wharton Teaching Excellence Award (2019). In recognition of his seminal biochemical research, and dedication and devotion to teaching, science-communication, and mentorship, Rea was recently bestowed with an honorary Doctorate of Science (D.Sc.) by the University of Oxford, UK (2020).  Publications  Rea is the author of over 100 papers and commentaries, and the author of two books, Fall (2004) and Managing Discovery: Harnessing Creativity to Drive Biomedical Innovation (2018). Fall (2004), a photo-book for which Rea wrote the text, is a \\"hyper-macroscopic analysis of the color transformations characteristic of tree foliage in the Northeastern United States autumn...[featuring] vivid and brilliant images.\\" This book was a joint project with Rea's former biochemistry mentee, Christopher Griffith, who is now a professional photographer. Managing Discovery: Harnessing Creativity to Drive Biomedical Innovation (2018), coauthored with Mark V. Pauly and Lawton R. Burns, addresses the link between life sciences discoveries and their dependence on the investor-driven market system through in-depth considerations of the challenges that both scientists and managers must face in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries.

Early life and career Vera Stein Ehrlich was born on 4 October 1897 in Zagreb to Adolf and Ida Ehrlich.Ja≈°a Romano, 1980, p. 491 She grew up in Zagreb with her younger sister Ina Jun-Broda (1899-1983) who later become notable writer and translator. She studied pedagogy and psychology in Berlin and Vienna. At the age of 19, she began publishing works on psychological and pedagogic problems. In 1933, 1934, and 1936, she published books on the issues of education of children and youth. As part of the fifteen studies conducted in those years, she was writing about the methods and meaning of drawing and books for children. Her paper on the impact of illness on the character of the child was a result of cooperation with her husband Dr. Ben Stein. At that time, Ehrlich was particularly concerned with individual psychology, probably influenced by the achievements of Austrian psychologist Alfred Adler to whom she wrote an obituary in the \\"Jew\\", Gazette of the Jewish Community of Zagreb. In that same period, she became interested in the problem of the position of women in the Yugoslav society. She was among the first to start discussing these issues scientifically in order to encourage the change of policy, legal norms and the attitude of society towards the woman and to help so they would stop being treated as second-class citizens. She also studied the activities of women in the economy. With her writing, she encouraged woman activism in society and struggle for the right to vote. Already in 1935, she emphasized the successes of the feminist movement in her works. She was interested in the process of liberating women from the tutoring of a man who was still legally superior. Disempowerment and the lack of protection of women in, at the then conservative patriarchal society, motivated her to conduct research and start teaching. She studied the life of rural families and intergenerational relationships. Psychological analysis of life situations has introduced her to the field of social anthropology. At the time, she had already prepared a survey on issues that enabled her to gain insight into the social situation in rural areas which also provided her with an analysis of the status of women and the relationship between the family members. The survey was forwarded to many associations in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. By the beginning of World War II, she received responses from 300 villages.Etnolo≈°ka tribina (Gazzete of the Jewish Community of Croatia); Vesna ƒåulinoviƒá-Konstantinoviƒá; Vera Stein Erlich (In memoriam); p. 275, 276, 277; no. 24, vol. 31 December 2001, Zagreb. Later work By the beginning of the Second World War, Ehrlich belonged to a group of prominent advanced Yugoslav intellectuals. After Nazi invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941, she fled to Split where she joined Yugoslav Partisans. During the Holocaust, the Usta≈°e killed Ehrlich's husband Ben Stein and nephew Aleksandar Saviƒá. After the war, she gained Ph.D. in cultural anthropology at University of California, where she also lectured on the anthropology of Croats and South Slavs from 1952 to 1960. In the United States, she was a close associate of American anthropologist Alfred L. Kroeber. She considered collaboration with him and Robert Lowie an important incentive which helped her grow into a good social anthropologist. She considered their influence to be crucial for her acceptance of the anthropological discoveries she approached earlier in her pre-war studies. After her return to SFR Yugoslavia, she lectured social anthropology at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences and Faculty of Political Science of the University of Zagreb. During that time, she studied the position of women in traditional societies and transformation of a rural family. In her post-war work, Ehrlich developed the evolutionary phases of the relationship and structure of rural families, analyzing the examples of collectivism as the indicative phase of the pre- individualist processes in the South Slavic social milieu. According to individual and social behavior, she defined a regional traditional cultural complex. She also noticed changes in the \\"tribal\\" society of mountain regions of SFR Yugoslavia. She analyzed the values and their valorization by the social group, that is, indications of intercultural impacts. Intergenerational relationships, family transformations, changes in the perceptions and behaviors of a group, individual and phenomenon of authority were constantly at the core of her interests. Her two works, 1964 \\"Family in Transformation\\" and 1968 \\"In Society with Man\\", are still a special feature in ethnological and sociological literature. They were used as textbooks at the Zagreb Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, as well as in faculties in Sarajevo, the Netherlands, the US and England, where she was a guest professor at the departments of sociology on several occasions. In addition to studying the relationship between the sexes in patriarchal rural environments, Ehrlich also studied domestic partnerships. Her analyzes were in the context of events in the families of the communities, and led to conclusions on the regional \\"cultural climate\\". Ehrlich knew well the interpersonal and family relations of a great part of Southeast Europe, as well as the characteristics of living of other indigenous cultures, as she used to say \\"from Arctic to Antarctica\\". She used her wide knowledge in comparing problems and processes of changing. As a passionate researcher, she was recording data whenever she got a chance. She spent last 20 years of her life in SFR Yugoslavia and has devoted mostly to studying the processes in the rural cultural milieu of Croatia and the wider neighboring mountainous areas. As she aged, she was rarely present at scientific conferences with last one she attended being the one held in Bloomington in 1973. Nevertheless, she was still active in professional societies, primarily in the Commission for the Advancement of Family Development and Solving Social Problems of Women in SR Croatia. Many of her colleagues from various countries, such as sociologist Rudi Supek and ethnographer Marijana Gu≈°iƒá, visited her often in her apartment in Visoka street 10. She enjoyed discussing the problems of the profession and transferring her knowledge to the young. In 1979, she was awarded Kata Pejnoviƒá award for science. Vera Stein Ehrlich died on 31 August 1980 in Zagreb.

It sits on the site of a church of the same name built by the Jesuits in 1549, one of the first in Brazil. The present church was designed by the Italian architect Julio Conti in the Neo-Manueline style and consecrated in 1932. It is owned by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of S√£o Salvador da Bahia and houses numerous original works of art of the early colonial period. The Chapel of Our Lady of Help was listed as a historic structure by National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN) in 1938 and is part of the Historic Center of Salvador UNESCO World Heritage Site. History Statue of Manuel da N√≥brega (1517-1570) The first Jesuits arrived in Brazil in the Armada of the first Governor-General, Tom√© de Sousa. The Jesuits built the first Chapel of Our Lady of Help in 1549 under the supervision of Manuel da N√≥brega (1517-1570). It was a simple structure with thatched roof, and was built as part of the construction of the city of Salvador, and was located inside the enclosure of the upper city of Salvador, which at time was surrounded by a palisade for the protection of the settlers. The church was dedicated to Our Lady of Help, which was the name of one of the ships of the fleet of Tom√© de Sousa. In addition to serving the Jesuits, the church served as a parish headquarters; Manuel Louren√ßo as the first priest of the parish. With the creation of the Diocese of Bahia in 1551, the bishop Dom Pedro Fernandes Sardinha (1496-1556) converted the church into the first cathedral of Bahia, called the \\"S√© da Palha\\" (Straw See), and settled in close vicinity to the church. Both Diocese and the Jesuits began to occupy a pieces of land outside the walls of the city later in the 16th century; the bishops erected a cathedral proper, and the Jesuits constructed a separate college and church. Chapel of Our Lady of Help had to be rebuilt by the mid-16th century; a structure of stone and lime was completed in 1579 by Bishop Sardinha. A commemorative inscription was found with the date during a renovation in 1877. The chapel remained the property of the Jesuits until their expulsion from Brazil in 1759. The church was then abandoned. It remained in disuse until 1823, when it was transferred to a religious brotherhood, the Irmandade do Senhor do Bom Jesus do Passos e Vera Cruz (Brotherhood of the Lord of Bom Jesus do Passos and Vera Cruz). The colonial-period church was demolished in 1912 under the direction of Archbishop Jer√¥nimo Tom√© da Silva (1849-1924) during a large-scale urban reform of Salvador. The structure was split down the middle to accommodate a small access road behind the current structure. The present Chapel of Our Lady of Help was constructed to the front of the footprint of the old structure. It was designed by the Italian architect J√∫lio Conti and consecrated in 1932. A bust of Father Manuel da N√≥brega was placed in front of the church in the same year. Structure The Chapel of Our Lady of Help consists of a nave, choir, a single lateral chapel, and sacristy. It has a small fenced-in church yard; the statue of Father N√≥brega sits outside of the fence. =Interior= The interior of the Chapel of Our Lady of Help is home to numerous colonial-period pieces of art. The image of Our Lady of Help is reputably the same image brought by Tome de Souza in 1549; it is located on the high altar of the church. The wood pulpit dates to the 17th century; Ant√≥nio Vieira (1608-1697), the Portuguese Jesuit preacher and writer, delivered several sermons from the same pulpit, namely, the Sermon for the Good Success of the Arms of Portugal Against Those of Holland in 1640. An image of Christ, titled Nosso Senhor dos Passos (Our Lord of the Stations of the Cross), is located in the sacristy and is the work of F√©lix Pereira Guimar√£es. A second image of Christ of the same name is located in the lateral chapel of the church; it is of unknown authorship but likely from Portugal. The walls and ceilings are decorated with paintings by Oreste Sercille and his son Bruno Sercille. The main stained glass window of the church, visible at the center of the fa√ßade of the church, has an image of Our Lady of Help surrounded by lilies and a band of stars.

Roach Cannery Warehouse and Office Building is an industrial structure located at 89 East Sanborn in Croswell, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005, and now contains apartments, known as Cannery Village. History William R. Roach owned a pea-canning factory in Hart, Michigan. In 1915, he planted an experimental crop north of Lexington, Michigan to determine if the soil was suitable. The crop thrived, and in 1917 Roach proposed an agreement to the Croswell Improvement Association to build a canning factory there. The Improvement Association agreed, money was raised, and work on the foundation of the building began in November 1917. Work ceased during the winter, and was resumed in March 1918. The factory was completed in mid-May. Construction on the adjoining warehouse began in 1918 and ended the next year. At the same time that construction was being completed, Roach dismantled his factory in Hart and moved the equipment to the new plant. Production of canned peas was begun even before the exterior of the plant was finalized. The cannery provided significant employment for the surrounding community. During World War I and World War II, production shifted to supporting the armed forces, with pork and beans being a significant part of the output. William R. Roach retired in the early 1930s, and the cannery business was reorganized and sold to Compton Foods. Stokely Van Camp Foods purchased the plant in 1946, and operated it until its closure in 1978. The factory was demolished in stages, and was completely gone in 1994. The warehouse was used by a local company until 1999. In 2004, the warehouse was refurbished into 41 apartments, known as Cannery Village. Description The original complex constructed by W.R. Roach included a cannery itself, a warehouse, an office building and a vinery building. Both the vinery building and the cannery have been demolished, leaving the warehouse and office building.

Biography Mary Braut was born on 7 August 1929 in Celje. Her family moved to Zagreb in 1941. After finishing high school in 1949, she enrolled at the Zagreb Faculty of Architecture. As a young girl, she danced and sang in the National Folk Dance Ensemble of Croatia LADO where she met her husband Sead Saraƒçeviƒá. The couple had two children. In 1967, she found out that Saraƒçeviƒá had a mistress, so she left him. In order to earn a living, she started photographing. Namely, as she later stated, To≈°o Dabac pushed the camera into her hands, sent her to the street and said, \\"photograph\\". At first, she was Dabac's pupil and later associate. She held a first independent exhibition in 1969 in the gallery of the Zagreb Student Center. In the same year, she was admitted to the membership of the Croatian Association of Artists of Applied Arts (ULUPUH). Braut worked in the Galleries of the City of Zagreb (today's Museum of Contemporary Art) where she photographed for catalogs and portraits of many artists. Since 1972, she has worked as an independent artist. She has exhibited her art photography on more than a hundred independent and group exhibitions. Many of her photographs have been published in both the newspapers and specialized journals. As a photographer, she also cooperated with many Croatian theaters and festivals, such as the Croatian National Theater in Zagreb, Zagreb Youth Theater, Gavella Drama Theater, Kerempuh Theater and Dubrovnik Summer Festival. She was also an official photographer on the set of the most expensive movie of Yugoslav production, Battle of Sutjeska. She photographed children, people in the streets, various portraits, artists during the work, landscapes of various regions, war destruction, Dalmatian cities, and above all, Zagreb. She exhibited in: Zagreb - 1969 (with Petar Dabcem), 1971, 1977, 1979 (\\"Umjetnici na≈°ih dana\\" [Artists of Our Days]), 1980, 1986 (\\"Zagreb - Moj grad\\" [Zagreb - My Town]), 1988, Maribor and Ljubljana - 1970, Split - 1971, Mannheim - 1972 \\"\\"To≈°o Dabac und sein Atelier\\" [To≈°o Dabac and his Atelier]), Dubrovnik - 1978, and Velika Gorica - 1983. Braut held the last large exhibition, consisting of her then unknown and less exposed photographs, at the Zagreb Art Pavilion in 2014. Her photographs and thousands of negatives are kept in collections of many Zagreb museums, Croatian State Archives, Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts, Croatian Ministry of Defense and elsewhere. She received many awards, including the Zagreb City Award (1972) and the Lifetime Achievements Award of the Croatian Association of Artists of Applied Arts (2008).

Dayton, (903 N.W.2d 609), was a 2017 Minnesota Supreme Court case where the Court ruled that Governor Mark Dayton's line item vetoes of appropriations for the Minnesota Senate and Minnesota House of Representatives were a lawful exercise of his authority granted by the Minnesota Constitution. The Court also ruled that since the state legislature had access to other funding to continue operating as a fully functioning and independent branch of government, the governor's vetoes did not effectively abolish the legislature and thereby violate Article III of the state constitution. The Court also ruled that the judicial branch did not have the constitutional authority to order funding without a corresponding budgetary appropriation. The Supreme Court's ruling overturned an earlier ruling by a Ramsey County District Court judge. The case marked the first time in which the Minnesota Supreme Court was asked to resolve a lawsuit brought by one branch of government against another. Background The Minnesota Legislature adjourned its regular session in 2017 on May 22 with a significant amount of unfinished business; it had failed to pass any omnibus spending bills establishing the state's budget for the next two years. Legislative leaders came to an agreement with Governor Mark Dayton to call a special session immediately following the adjournment of the regular session to address this unfinished business. Just before the conclusion of the special session, the legislature passed a series of appropriations bills for the state's budget. After the four-day special session had adjourned on May 26, Dayton allowed the bills to become law, but vetoed line item appropriations funding the legislature. Dayton issued a letter explaining his vetoes; he sought to avoid a government shutdown while convincing legislative leaders to renegotiate provisions of the budgetary bills. This conflict represented one instance of a lengthy dispute between Dayton, of the Democratic‚ÄìFarmer‚ÄìLabor Party (DFL), and the Republican-led Legislature over the scope of the state government. Among the budgetary bills was a bill containing a package of tax cuts totaling $650 million that Dayton opposed. However, the bill was worded in such a way that if Dayton had vetoed it, the Minnesota Department of Revenue would have been defunded‚Äîa situation that he wished to avoid. Legislative leaders refused to negotiate and sued Dayton, arguing that his vetoes had the unconstitutional effect of abolishing the legislature. Lower court ruling In late June, prior to making a final ruling on the case, Ramsey County District Court Chief Judge John Guthmann issued a temporary order that the Legislature continue to be funded at previous levels through October 1. (The Legislature's funding had been set to expire on June 30 with the end of the state's fiscal year.) On July 19, Chief Judge Guthmann ruled that Dayton's vetoes were unconstitutional in that they violated the Minnesota Constitution's Separation of Powers clause by effectively abolishing the legislature. Guthmann indicated that a main reason that Dayton's vetoes were problematic was that he did not actually object to the appropriations themselves; the purpose of the vetoes was to convince legislators to renegotiate other appropriations and policies unrelated to the legislature's funding. Upon news of the ruling, Dayton immediately indicated his intent to appeal the decision. Ruling of the Supreme Court In a majority opinion, Chief Justice Lorie Skjerven Gildea stated that Dayton's actions were within his constitutional authority as governor. On September 9, the Minnesota Supreme Court made a preliminary ruling that when Dayton vetoed appropriations for the legislature, he did not violate his constitutional authority to make line item vetoes for budgetary appropriations. The Court also ordered the parties into talks with a mediator. It also strongly encouraged the parties to find a political solution to resolve this dispute. The Court did not remand the case back to the lower Ramsey County court, thereby giving it the ability to make a further ruling if the attempts at mediation were unsuccessful. Both parties met with mediator Rick Solum over the course of two days (September 21 and 22), but he determined that the legislative leaders and Dayton had irreconcilable differences and that their impasse could not be overcome without a further ruling by the Court. Following the impasse, Dayton claimed that legislative leaders had \\"lied to\\" Minnesotans and the Supreme Court about the legislature's ability to finance its operations until the start of the upcoming legislative session to begin in February 2018. One week later, the Supreme Court ordered legislative leaders to submit a full report of their current financial situation regarding funding on hand and their ability to continue to function. On November 16, the Court issued its final ruling and upheld Dayton's vetoes. The Court also stated that the Legislature had access to sufficient funding to continue to exist until the beginning of the next legislative session; consequently, Dayton's actions remained within his constitutional authority. The Court's ruling was issued by a 5‚Äì1 majority; Justice Barry Anderson dissented, and Justice David Stras recused himself from the case. Additionally, in the Court's ruling, Chief Justice Lorie Skjerven Gildea stated that the judicial branch had no authority to appropriate funding without a legislative counterpart. The Court declined to take a stance on the matter of whether Dayton's veto of the legislative funding was coercive; the Court determined that the legislature would be able to continue to operate until the next legislative session. In the majority ruling for the Court, Chief Justice Gildea acknowledged the unprecedented nature of the case saying, \\"For the first time in Minnesota history, we are asked to resolve a lawsuit brought by one of our coordinate branches of government‚Äîthe Legislative Branch‚Äîagainst our other coordinate branch of government‚Äîthe Executive Branch.\\"The Ninetieth Minnesota State Senate, et al., v. Mark B. Dayton, in his official capacity as Governor of the State of Minnesota, et al., 62-CV-17-3601 (2017) p.3, paragraph 2 Since the governor's line item veto power was established in 1876,Michael, p. 2. \\"In 1876, Minnesota voters amended the Constitution giving the governor item veto power, the authority to veto one or more items of appropriation in a bill with multiple appropriations while approving the rest of the bill.\\" the case was only the sixth instance of litigation involving the power in Minnesota history and only the third instance in which such litigation reached the Minnesota Supreme Court.Michael, p. 25. \\"Only a few item veto cases have been litigated in Minnesota‚Äîfive challenging Governor Arne Carlson‚Äôs vetoes and one challenging Governor Mark Dayton‚Äôs vetoes. ... Two of the cases [involving Governor Carlson] were decided by the Minnesota Supreme Court...\\" Reactions to the ruling and aftermath Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton Governor Mark Dayton applauded the Supreme Court's ruling and cast blame on Republican legislative leaders for initiating the lengthy and expensive legal dispute. The final costs of legal fees borne by Minnesota taxpayers totaled $768,000. Republican Speaker of the House Kurt Daudt disputed suggestions that the Court‚Äôs ruling was a winning proposition for Governor Dayton; he saw the matter as unsettled. Paul Gazelka, the Senate Majority Leader, expressed dismay at the news of the Court‚Äôs ruling, saying that the Legislature would be forced to take extreme measures to keep itself funded, and suggested that this put the Legislature and the State of Minnesota in a precarious situation. Daudt said that this unprecedented financial situation put the Senate at risk of defaulting on scheduled debt payments for the Senate‚Äôs office building. Following the Supreme Court ruling, the Minnesota Legislative Coordinating Commission (LCC)‚Äîa bipartisan group of leaders from both houses of the Legislature‚Äîagreed to provide the Legislature with $20 million from its carry-over funds and 2019 appropriations to continue regular operations until the beginning of the next regular session. These funds supplemented cash reserves from the House and Senate as well as temporary funding approved by the District Court. After the Legislature reconvened its regular session in 2018, it voted to restore the funding which Dayton had vetoed. On February 26, Dayton signed the bill into law. In addition to reinstating funding for the Legislature, the bill provided for the LCC to have its payments to the Legislature reimbursed. Although Standard & Poor's had \\"put a 'negative' watch\\" on the state's otherwise high credit rating while this case proceeded through the courts, the company ultimately upgraded the state's credit rating to AAA in July 2018, after the case and the Legislature's funding uncertainties were resolved. The Associated Press described the Supreme Court ruling as \\"a major legal victory\\" for Dayton, and the ruling definitively established the governor's power to exercise the line item veto power for any purpose. The Legislature prevailed from a policy perspective, however, as none of the changes to tax policy that Dayton sought were legally enacted.Michael, p. 32. \\"[N]one of the tax and policy changes [Dayton] sought were enacted into law. The legislature effectively won the budget and policy battle, but the governor won the legal war by firmly establishing the principle that a governor can use the item veto for any purpose...\\" The Legislature's session in 2018 was marked by continued discord between the Republican and DFL parties; many of the most significant bills from the session were ultimately vetoed by Dayton, including bills regarding tax reforms and further budgetary appropriations. Pursuant to the results of the 2018 Minnesota elections, Minnesotans elected a new governor from the DFL party and installed a DFL majority in the House of Representatives; the Republican party maintained a narrow majority in the Senate.

Built in 1835 and enlarged in 1884, it is a well-preserved example of a Greek Revival house with a four-column temple portico. Now part of a professional office complex called Terry Commons, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The Terry-Hayden House is located east of downtown Bristol, on the east side of Middle Street (Connecticut Route 229), just south of its junction with Pine Street. It is set well back from the road, separated from it by open space and the parking lot of the accompanying modern profession office complex. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and mainly clapboarded exterior. It is composed of several different sections, the most prominent being the three-bay center. It is fronted by a mammoth two-story Greek Revival temple front, with four square Doric columns rising to a full entablature and pedimented gable. The gable cornice is studded with modillions, and it central field is filled with a semi-oval window. Windows are set in rectangular openings with projecting caps, and the main entrance is in the right bay, framed by pilasters and a corniced entablature. To the right of this bay is the 1884 addition, a two-bay frame structure with similar window styling. A more modern two-story ell, also with sympathetic styling, has been to the left side. The central portion of the house was built in 1831 by Theodore Terry, a nephew of Eli Terry who was like his father and uncle a clockmaker, operating one of the city's largest clock factories. Terry sold the house in 1850 to Henry Mitchell, a lawyer, businessman, and politician. Mitchell made the addition on the right side of the house. In 1899 it was purchased by Leonard Hayden, whose family owned it at least into the early 1980s. The house is a prominent local example of Greek Revival architecture, notable both for its late Federal period features (the semi-oval window), and the sympathetic Italianate addition of Mitchell.

Early life and education Eugene C. Murdock was born in Lakewood, Ohio, on April 30, 1921, and attended school there. His father, Stanely H. Murdock, worked for the city of Cleveland, Ohio, in the division of engineering and construction. Stanley and his wife Elizabeth had three sons, Donald L., Stanley H., Jr., Eugene C., and one daughter, Marjorie C. A young Eugene Murdock saw his first major league baseball game on August 10, 1929, at League Park in Cleveland, Ohio where the New York Yankees played the Indians . As he grew older, Murdock would serve as sports editor of his high school newspaper. Baseball and writing would be lifelong passions of Murdock's, and he would go on to become a major researcher into the history of the sport. Murdock was a student at Wooster College in September 1939, completed his bachelor's degree by December 1942, and then joined the Army. After serving in the Army, Murdock entered Columbia University in 1946. Working with Allan Nevins at Columbia, Murdock learned to appreciate the significance of oral history research. Murdock graduated with his MA in 1948 and Ph.D. in 1951. Career Murdock's first teaching assignment was at Rio Grande College in southern Ohio beginning in 1952. Murdock then moved to Marietta College in 1956 where he was an assistant professor in history, being promoted to full professor in 1963. Murdock became Chair of the department in 1972, holding that position until his retirement in 1986. After his retirement, Murdock was named Historian of the College. In 1991, Murdock received the Distinguished Service Award from the Ohio Academy of History. Society for American Baseball Research Since 1973, Murdock was a frequent contributor to the SABR Baseball Research Journal. His first article looked at players in the 19th century, The Pre-1900 Batting Stars. Murdock served as president of SABR from 1976 to 1978, but served in various positions both before and after. Prior to serving as president, Murdock was chair of the SABR Hall of Fame Committee. He also was head of the SABR Nominating Committee (1981‚Äì1982) when he proposed two-year terms for the operating officers. This proposal would later be adopted by SABR. Baseball oral history research Traveling across the United States between 1973 and 1987, Murdock interviewed 76 former baseball players. His time with Prof. Nevins at Columbia impressed on Murdock the importance of interviewing older persons as well as those not as well known as some. The interviews range from 30 minutes to multiple hours, and the audio is now available on Cleveland Public Library's Digital Gallery. The interviews are also featured in Murdock's book Baseball Players and Their Times, Oral Histories of the Game: 1920-40. The oral history collection is part of Murdock's voluminous baseball research papers. Initially offered to Marietta College but declined, the collection was \\"promptly and eagerly\\" accepted by Cleveland Public Library in 1992. In addition to the oral histories, the overall collection also includes \\"major league biographies, annuals, and scrapbooks, covering the years 1910-1976.\\" Other research Murdock also wrote two books on the draft during the American Civil War: Patriotism Limited: 1862-1865 (1967) and One Million Men: The Civil War Draft in the North (1971) Murdock's research interests also included World War II.

It was published by Allen Lane (a hardback imprint of the Penguin Group) in 2013 with the full title Feral: Searching for Enchantment on the Frontiers of Rewilding. The book has also been published as Feral: rewilding the land, sea and human life (paperback and American editions). Monbiot looks at rewilding projects around the world. However, he pays particular attention to the scope for rewilding in the United Kingdom. He argues that overgrazing is a problem in the British uplands and calls for sheep numbers to be reduced so that areas can be rewilded. Such ideas received criticism from organisations representing farmers, for example the Farmers' Union of Wales.\\"FUW Rejects 'Ecological Disaster' Accusation; 'WE WON'T GIVE IN TO LATEST ATTACK ON OUR WAY OF LIFE'\\" . Western Mail (Cardiff, Wales). MGN Ltd. 2013. Accessed via HighBeam Research. 2 Dec. 2017 (subscription required). On the other hand, the book received favourable reviews, including in publications normally hostile to Monbiot's work, such as The Spectator and The Daily Telegraph. Many reviewers were impressed by the lyrical nature of the book's prose style. According to the New Statesman's reviewer \\"something about the charm and persistence of Monbiot‚Äôs argument has the hypnotic effect of a stoat beguiling a hapless rabbit\\". Origin and Definition of ‚ÄòRewilding‚Äô Concept By Monbiot's own account, rewilding was a fringe interest at the time he published the book. However, there had been attempts at rewilding in Britain such as \\"Wild Ennerdale\\" at Ennerdale, Cumbria, a project which Monbiot finds limited in scope. The word ‚Äòrewilding‚Äô entered the dictionary in 2011, with its definition greatly contested from the start.Chambers Dictionary, 12th Edition Initially, it was defined as releasing captive animals into the wild, but the definition was soon expanded to describe the reintroduction of animal and plant species to habitats from which they had been excised. In other circles, the term is used to indicate the rehabilitation of entire ecosystems, instead of particular species only. The definitions preferred by the author differ slightly from these, as they entail permitting ecological processes to resume (without human intervention), and embracing the fluctuations in the physical environment (instead of attempting to keep it in a state of arrested development). In summary, Monbiot defines the concept as follows: ‚ÄúRewilding, to me, is about resisting the urge to control nature and allowing it to find its own way.‚Äù Feral, p 9-10 Intended reader Monbiot addresses readers who feel the urge for a wilder life and encourages them to challenge their perception of humankind‚Äôs place in the world, the world's ecosystems, and the interaction between humankind and nature.Feral, p 11 Among other topics, the author looks at the phenomenon of British big cats, supposed sightings which in his view reflect human origins in a wilder landscape. Content Format After initial chapters that serve as an introduction to the author‚Äôs personal and academic interest in the subject matter, the content takes the form of case studies. =Author's Intent and Purpose of Book= According to the author, case studies relating successful rewilding projects around the world (Scotland, Wales, North America) serve to provide examples of good practice and offer the reader hope (that rewilding is indeed possible). In chapter 11, ‚ÄúThe Beast Within (or how not to rewild)‚Äù, case studies of rewilding in Slovenia, Croatia, Eastern Poland and the Americas that occurred as result of political tyranny, civil war, genocide and tyranny serve as cautionary tales. The author strongly believes that rewilding must not be an opposition to the people who live on and benefit from the land but must be done with their consent and active engagement. Awards The book won awards from: * The Zoological Society of London: Thomson Reuters/Zoological Record Award (2013). Presented for the public communication of zoology.ZSL Scientific Awards winners announced * The Society of Biology: Book Award for general biology (2014). Dr William Marshall, Fellow of the Society of Biology and chair of the judging panel, said Feral was an ‚Äúimportant and captivating book concerning humanity‚Äôs stewardship of the earth‚Äù.Society Awards Celebrate Biology Books and Art * Orion magazine: The Orion Book Award for nonfiction (2015). Outcomes One of the outcomes of the book was the charity Rewilding Britain founded in 2015. The debate between Monbiot and the farming community about the management of Britain's uplands has continued, for example in the aftermath of the Storm Desmond floods in Cumbria.

He first appeared in the nineteenth series episode \\"Group Animal ‚àí Part One\\", broadcast on 5 December 2017. John is a consultant neurosurgeon who joins the staff at Holby City Hospital as the director of surgical innovations. The character and McGann's casting was announced on 4 April 2017 and the actor began filming in August. Producers approached McGann about the role while he was appearing in a theatre production and when he liked the character, he signed a twelve-month contract. John is characterised as an excellent surgeon with an established reputation. John's backstory states he attended university with Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry) and Roxanna MacMillan (Hermione Gulliford) and in his career, John has used stem cell treatment to reverse motor neurone disease. Despite his fame, John remains down-to-earth and has not become arrogant. John's two-part introduction sees him arrive at the hospital as a mass shooting begins, which kills and injures regular characters. A trailer and promotional image was released for John's introduction. The character has been well-received by critics, who anticipated his introduction.  Casting  On 4 April 2017, it was announced that actor Paul McGann had joined the cast of Holby City as new surgeon Professor John Gaskell. BBC head of continuing drama Oliver Kent expressed his delight at McGann's casting and said he admired the actor's career. Series producer Kate Hall also expressed her joy at McGann's casting, while executive producer Simon Harper called McGann \\"one of our country's most internationally renowned screen talents\\". Of his casting, McGann commented, \\"I'm really excited to be joining Holby. Professor John Gaskell is certainly going to be an interesting character and I can't wait to get started on the wards.\\" McGann began filming in August 2017. Producers approached McGann about a role in the serial while he was appearing in a touring theatre production. They presented the character to McGann, which impressed him. He proceeded to contact school friend and actor Guy Henry, who portrays Henrik Hanssen in the series. Henry encouraged him to pursue the role. Holby City marked the first time McGann had been involved in a long-running drama series, something which he stated he had always wanted to attempt. He described joining a continuing drama as \\"a slight culture shock\\". McGann was initially contracted on a twelve-month contract. McGann felt that he would have suited a career in medicine if he had not become an actor. McGann said he is not \\"squeamish\\", which helped him in the role. He struggled with learning the medical terminology and felt that it was challenging to say the terminology while \\"looking like you know what you're doing\\". The first scenes that McGann filmed were set in a theatre, where he had to repeat medical terminology. He compared the scenes to \\"an initiation ceremony\\" because his co-stars were able to pronounce the terminology. A surgeon was present in McGann's first scenes to aid him with his portrayal. While filming, the surgeon praised his performance, stating that he mirrored a surgeon's stance in theatre. McGann enjoyed speaking with the medical advisors and learning new facts about medicine. McGann described the filming method as enlightening and \\"unusual\\" since he has not worked in such a manner. He also found the initial filming complicated and persistent, commenting, \\"It's relentless with a new character. They front-load you with it.\\"  Development  = Characterisation and relationships = John is billed as a \\"surgical star with irrepressible charm\\" who will save Holby City Hospital after he arrives with plans to move the hospital into \\"an exciting but unknown future\\". John uses his charm to put himself at an advantage. McGann called John a \\"mercurial force to be reckoned with\\" who clashes with senior hospital staff Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel), Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry) and Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie). John has an \\"international reputation\\" and believes that the NHS needs a drastic transformation so that it can improve. Hall stated that John's fierce personality creates \\"a really big galvanising effect\\" on the hospital staff. John is an excellent surgeon, although McGann stated that this \\"comes at a price\\" as there is a \\"drive\\" behind John's motives. McGann explained that despite his surgical excellence, John struggles socially and is \\"quite awkward\\". John can work well in a challenging environment; he is strong, strong-minded, able to work under pressure and succeed in his work. McGann has a strong Liverpudlian accent, which he had to condense for the role. The actor hoped that fans would like his character, but also be unsure of whether to trust him. When working in a team of people, John holds high expectations for his team and is hard to please. John is good at choosing his team members as he can identify who will accompany him well and who are in need of a leader. Having attended the same university, John knows Hanssen and Roxanna MacMillan (Hermione Gulliford) before his arrival. McGann stated that Hanssen and Roxanna know John very well and are aware of his weaknesses. Producers wanted to explore the friends' history. McGann and Henry are also friends and have not worked together since attending drama school so they found it amusing that their characters are friends. John initially clashes with Jac as she is not won over by his charm. McGann stated that while the pair are \\"almost combative\\", John appreciates her achievements and talent. Upon his arrival, John becomes concerned for Jac's wellbeing, noticing she is facing \\"mounting pressure\\". = Introduction = John is introduced in the nineteenth series episode \\"Group Animal ‚Äì Part One\\", broadcast on 5 December. John first appears in the first of a two-part episode, broadcast in the week commencing 4 December. When John arrives at the hospital, members of staff are waiting for him so they can welcome him to the team. However, he is keen to avoid this and enters in the hospital through the back entrance. Vicki Fower of The Daily Express called John's entrance a display of his \\"idiosyncratic ways\\". He asks that a picture of a woman is hung on the wall for him. After arriving, John begins implenting his new changes on the hospital, although is interrupted when the hospital suffers from \\"one of the biggest threats\\" they have ever encountered. Harper stated he is \\"proud\\" of the character's first episode and said that John's introduction within the episodes creates \\"the icing on the cake\\". Duncan Lindsay, writing for the Metro, billed the two-parter as \\"dramatic and showstopping\\". On John's introduction, McGann commented, \\"It's almost like you see in Western movies when the hero turns up to save the village ‚Äì that's John!\\" The actor felt that John's introduction showcased how he can work well in a crisis. McGann believed that John's dramatic introduction demonstrated his \\"technical acumen from the off\\". He said that John becomes the \\"hero of the hour\\" when he helps the situation. Lindsay (Metro) confirmed that at least one character would die in the episodes. The reporter questioned whether the hospital's staff could \\"pull together\\" with John's leadership. In the episode, Jac is shot by someone off screen, leaving her hurt and bleeding. David Brown, writing for the Radio Times, confirmed that John would be involved in saving Jac's life as he attempts to save her. A show spokesperson said that characters' lives would be dramatically changed after the events of the second episode. Lindsay revealed that John would encounter challenges in surgery. McGann explained that John operating on Jac would demonstrate how well he can work in a crisis. In the second episode, John saves Jac's life after emergency surgery and at the end of the episode, John and Sacha Levy (Bob Barrett) discover a dead Raf di Lucca (Joe McFadden) slumped in a lift, having been shot by Fredrik Johansson (Billy Postlethwaite), who was revealed as the shooter. McFadden expressed his excitement at meeting McGann and said he was disappointed to not feature in any prominent scenes with McGann. He commented, \\"I'd been really excited to work with Paul McGann, but that was our only scene together and I happened to be dead!\\" McGann said that his introduction was \\"thrilling to film\\" as the episodes were \\"pretty dramatic\\" and \\"territory [the producers] thought hard about beforehand\\". On 21 November 2017, a trailer and promotional image for John's first episode was released. The trailer, captioned \\"When darkness falls, look to the light\\", displays the hospital under pressure from a disaster when John arrives and saves them. Lindsay (Metro) pointed out that the trailer represents that John is \\"pivotal in saving Holby from what befalls it.\\" Lindsay called the trailer \\"spooky\\". Huw Fullerton of Radio Times liked the trailer and branded it \\"exciting\\". Fans identified several similarities between the trailer to scenes from the Doctor Who television film, which McGann prominently starred in. Similarities included a doctor appearing scared in a blue light, and a figure running down a shadowy hospital corridor. Fullerton quipped that he expected McGann to \\"whip out the sonic screwdriver during surgery\\". Rianne Houghton of Digital Spy reported that fans noticed John repeating the word \\"regeneration\\", a Doctor Who term when discussing his motor neurone patient in his first episode. = Research project = Prior to joining Holby City Hospital, John reversed motor neurone disease in a patient in Portugal through his research into stem cell treatment. His research earned him a positive global reputation for being \\"a surgical god\\". McGann explained that the act provided John with \\"a certain level of fame\\". He told Allison Jones of Inside Soap that John arrives with a state of respect and allure. He explained that John is conscious of his fame and the effect it has on him. John's fame excites the hospital's staff as they realise that he has specifically chose to implement his ideas at their hospital. McGann stated that despite John's fame, he has not become arrogant as he believes his surgery has to be repeated on another patient to be proved successful. John's continuous research for his project serves as an awakening for the hospital's staff. McGann confirmed that the research's lack of funding would create a political aspect to the story. The next candidate chosen for the trial is Fiona Fawcett (Shannon Murray), who suffers from multiple sclerosis which has left her paralysed. Fiona is soon admitted to the hospital as a patient for John's research project. A What's on TV journalist pointed out, \\"This week, all eyes are on Holby again as Gaskell attempts to change another woman's life.\\" John plans to remove a nerve from Fiona's ankle, \\"[lace it] with stem cells\\" and embed it into her spine. As they go into surgery, John is \\"calm and focused\\" and he is pleased when the surgery goes well. McGann explained that John is \\"obsessed\\" by what his research project could achieve and is pushed by this. Over a month later, Fiona is readmitted with \\"flu-like symptoms\\", which worries John. He diagnoses her with an infection, but she does not respond to treatment and her organs begin to fail. John and Roxanna take Fiona to theatre and Roxanna concludes that the implant needs to be removed. John refuses but takes a sample from the implant. He later discovers that the implant caused the infection, but does not tell anyone. McGann explained that John \\"knows he isn't quite there yet with the trial and he worries it could still go wrong.\\" Fiona's condition deteriorates and she dies. Essie Harrison (Kaye Wragg), who works with John on the trial, begins to blame herself for Fiona's death. John then treats drug addict Will Harrington (Paul McEwan) and plans to cure him of his drug addiction. Roxanna believes that John is treating Will to \\"draw attention away\\" from his research project and is surprised when John asks her to join his research team. Will begins to have doubts about his operation so John tells Roxanna to persuade him to continue with it. Will agrees to surgery, but when he suffers a bleed in theatre, John has to stop the operation, leaving him displeased. After his arrival, John is seen to be visiting to a comatose woman in Portugal, who he calls \\"Patient X\\". This is explored in the series 20 episode \\"Bubble Wrap\\". In Lisbon, John promises the patient that she will \\"have a life again\\". In Holby, John decides to treat Mara Sandhurst (Lizzie Clarke), who is paralysed, in a bid to prove that his procedure works. Mara develops an infection and despite Roxanna's advice to postpone the surgery, John decides to continue with the operation and takes \\"big risks to ensure it's a success.\\" John returns to Lisbon where the truth about \\"Patient X\\" is explained.  Reception  Aspects from the character's primary storyline received three nominations at the 2018 Digital Spy Reader Awards: the storyline, billed \\"Gaskell's reign of terror\\", came in eleventh place in the \\"Best Soap Storyline\\" category with 3.4% of the total votes, while John murdering Roxanna came in eighth place in the category \\"Biggest OMG Soap moment\\" and in last place in the \\"Most devastating Soap Death\\" category. Victoria Wilson of What's on TV described John as a \\"respected surgeon\\", while a reporter from The Irish News called him a \\"high-flying neurosurgeon\\". Brown (Radio Times) thought John appeared \\"heroic\\". Fower (The Daily Express) labelled John \\"a star surgeon\\" and an \\"enigmatic doctor\\", while Jones (Inside Soap) described him as a \\"surgical supremo\\" and a \\"renowned neurosurgeon\\". She also branded John's first episodes unmissable. Fullerton (Radio Times) found McGann's casting to be \\"pretty exciting news\\". Lindsay (Metro) said that John's introduction was \\"long awaited\\". He also called the two-parter episode \\"shocking and unmissable\\". What's on TV David Hollingsworth named John's first episodes as his \\"pick of the best shows\\" for 5 December. He gave the episodes a four out of five star rating. He noted, \\"There‚Äôs also a new face on the wards, Professor John Gaskell, played by Paul McGann, who comes with a reputation for achieving what was thought to be impossible.\\" Stacia Briggs of Eastern Daily Press also included John's first episode in a list of TV highlights for the week commencing 2 December, naming it the highlight for 5 December. Brown (Radio Times) believed it was \\"only a matter of time before Paul McGann turned up as a surgeon on Holby City\\" following his previous roles. The reporter felt there was \\"too much build-up\\" to John's introduction and said he appeared to be \\"'Jesus' in the eyes of his patients\\". Motor neurone disease charity, the Motor Neurone Disease Association, received several complaints about John curing the disease and said the storyline is \\"hugely misleading\\" and \\"upsetting to many people\\". They stated that show researchers had not contacted them for any advice on how to handle the storyline. A writer for Soap World branded John a \\"corrupt doctor\\".

As a yearling in October 2002, the filly was consigned to the Tattersalls sale and was bought for 600,000 guineas by the bloodstock agent Dermot \\"Demi\\" O'Byrne on behalf John Magnier's Coolmore Stud organisation. She was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. During her racing career she raced for the partnership of Michael Tabor and Susan Magnier, usually carrying the blue and orange colours of Tabor. She was sired by Darshaan who won the Prix du Jockey Club for the Aga Khan in 1984 before becoming a successful breeding stallion. The best of his other offspring included Dalakhani, Mark of Esteem and Kotashaan. Necklace's dam Spinning the Yarn showed noracing ability, finishing seventh in her only race but was a daughter of the Irish Oaks winner Colorspin, making her a half- sister to Opera House and Kayf Tara. Racing career =2003: two-year-old season= Necklace was ridden in all of her races by Mick Kinane. On her racecourse debut ahe faced eleven opponents in a maiden race over six furlongs on 12 July at the Curragh. She was made the 3/1 favourite but despite recovering from a poor start she failed to overhaul the Jim Bolger-trained Soviet Belle and was beaten three quarters of a length into second place. The filly was then stepped up to Group 3 class for the Debutante Stakes over seven furlongs at the same track four weeks later and started 7/4 favourite against twelve opponents. She was restrained towards the rear before coming through to take the lead a furlong out and winning by a length from the British-trained Caldy Dancer with Red Feather in third. On 31 August Necklace was moved up again in class for the Group 1 Moyglare Stud Stakes and started 5/4 favourite in an eleven-runner field. Soviet Belle and Red Feather were again in opposition while the other fancied runners included River Belle (Princess Margaret Stakes) and Maroochydore (Silver Flash Stakes). Kinane restrained the filly in the early stages as her stablemate Oh So Precious set the pace before giving way to the Clive Brittain-trained Menhoubah approaching the last quarter mile. Necklace moved into third place a furlong out and finished strongly to take the lead and win by a length and a short head from Red Feather and Menhoubah. Commenting on the winner's future prospects Kinane said \\"Another furlong would be really up her street. She is going to be an Oaks filly next season and she would have a shout in the 1,000 Guineas too\\". Aidan O'Brien said \\"Necklace has improved with each run and is a lovely filly.\\" On her final race of the year Necklace was sent to France for the Group 1 Prix Marcel Boussac over 1400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 5 October. She started favourite but never looked to have any chance of winning and came home tenth of the sixteen runners behind Denebola. =2004: three-year-old season= Necklace began her second season in the 191st running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley mile at Newmarket Racecourse on 2 May. She started at odds of 8/1 and made no impact, tiring in the last quarter mile and finishing twelfth behind Attraction. She did a little better in the Irish 1000 Guineas three weeks later when she came home sixth behind Attraction, beaten six lengths by the winner. On 4 June the filly was moved up in distance for the 225th Epsom Oaks over one and a half miles in which she finished fourth behind Ouija Board, All Too Beautiful and Punctilious. In autumn Nacklace was sent to compete in the United States where she contested two races. In August she started a 25/1 outsider for the Beverly D. Stakes at Arlington Park and finished strongly to take third place, beaten half a length and a head by Crimson Palace and Riskaverse. At Belmont Park in September she started second favourite for the Garden City Breeders' Cup Handicap but finished fourth of the seven runners behind Lucifer's Stone. Breeding record After her retirement from racing Necklace became a broodmare for the Coolmore Stud. She was repeatedly mated with Sadler's Wells, who was her great-grandfather, or to that stallions male-line descendants. She produced one minor winner from eight foals: *Sapphire Bracelet, a bay filly, foaled in 2006, sired by Sadler's Wells. Failed to win in three races. *Scottish Reel, bay colt (later gelded), 2007 by Sadler's Wells. Failed to win in 28 races. *Ruby Necklace, bay filly, 2008, by Sadler's Wells.

It is listed as an endangered, threatened, or species of concern across much of edge of its range. It was named in the 1820s by Lewis David de Schweinitz and John Torrey in honor of Emerson Davis (1798‚Äì1866), a Massachusetts educator and \\"enthusiastic student of the genus\\" Carex. Description It grows up to tall, forming loose clumps, with leaves up to long and about across. The underside of the leaves are typically slightly hairy, but may be glabrous (hairless), especially further west. The base of the culms and basal leaf sheathes are dark red when young, becoming brown as they age. Each flowering stem has between two and five spikelets that droop at maturity from peduncles up to long. The terminal spikelet is staminate (male) at the base and pistillate (female) at the tip, a form known as androgynous. The mature lateral spikelets each have 12‚Äì30 plump perigynia. The perigynia are in length and across, ovoid with a short beak, and become orange-brown as they mature. The perigynia are subtended by awned scales up to in length, with the scale body shorter than the mature perigynia, but the awn often exceeding it in length. Carex davisii is distinguished from other similar species of sedges in the section Carex sect. Hymenochlaenae, such as Carex formosa, by its longer awned perigynia scales and lateral flowering spikes with one or two male flowers at the base. Distribution and habitat Carex davisii is found in eastern North America, ranging from Vermont west to Ontario and North Dakota, south to Tennessee and Texas, excluding the southeast Atlantic coast. It typically grows in rich floodplain forests, riverbottoms, and mesic woodlands associated with large streams. It can also be found in calcareous oak savannas and meadows. Conservation This species of sedge is listed as an endangered species in Connecticut and Massachusetts, endangered and extirpated in Maryland, threatened in Minnesota and New York, and as a special concern species in Tennessee. The destruction and degradation by humans of its floodplain habitat around large rivers, for agriculture and the installation of locks and dams, led to its listing as threatened in Minnesota in 1984. It is also threatened by invasive species.

Founded in 1919, the School is a center for teaching and research in architectural design, history, and theory at Princeton University. The School offers an undergraduate concentration (equivalent of major) and advanced degrees at the master's and doctoral levels. History In 1832, Joseph Henry, who later became the first secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, taught the first course in architecture at Princeton University. The course focused on the classification of architectural styles and designs. Additional courses and programs for architecture began in 1882 when Princeton University's Department of Art and Archaeology began courses on architecture and historical drawing in 1902. By 1915, the first academic committee convened to consider the establishment of a school of architecture. Arrangements for a new program were planned for 1917, but were delayed until 1919 when the School of Architecture formally opened. During its formative years, the School of Architecture's pedagogy was guided by some of the best architectural educators of the time: Howard Crosby Butler, E. Raymond Bossange, Frederick D'Amato, Sherley Warner Morgan, and Jean Labatut. Visitors and teachers included leaders like Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier, Richard Neutra, and R. Buckminster Fuller. In 1965, Robert Geddes was appointed the first dean of the School of Architecture. Under his direction, the School of Architecture grew in size and in prestige, while also collaborating with other departments at Princeton University. As the School of Architecture expanded, it began attracting notable architects as teachers, including Louis I. Kahn, Mario Salvadori, Michael Graves, Kenneth Frampton, Peter Eisenman, Diana Agrest, Robert Geddes, Alan Colquhoun, Michael Hays, Scott Cohen, and Anthony Vidler. By the end of the twentieth century, the School of Architecture established itself as an internationally renowned school for the study of architecture and design. It reorganized the A.B. degree around multiple fields of study and conducted renovations of the Architecture Building. It also promoted several members to its tenure-track faculty including Beatriz Colomina, Elizabeth Diller, and Guy Nordenson. The following individuals have served as deans of the School of Architecture: *Robert Geddes, 1965‚Äì1982 *Robert Maxwell, 1982‚Äì1989 *Ralph Lerner, 1989‚Äì2002 *Stan Allen, 2002‚Äì2012 *Alejandro Zaera-Polo, 2012‚Äì2014 *Mario Gandelsonas, 2015 *M√≥nica Ponce de Le√≥n, 2016-present Academics =Undergraduate= The School of Architecture offers a rigorous, interdisciplinary curriculum in the study of architecture. The degree conferred to students is an A.B. degree. Undergraduate students study a range of disciplines including architectural design, history of architecture, architectural analysis, computing, and others. Students may also enroll in the Program in Urban Studies which focuses on the study of cities, metropolitan regions, and urban and suburban landscapes. The degree requirements also include junior independent work, which involves a written exam supervised by a faculty adviser, and a senior thesis, demonstrating a research paper based on visual materials. =Graduate= The School of Architecture offers two graduate degrees: a professional degree (M.Arch.) and an academic degree (Ph.D.). The master's degree takes three years to complete and requires students to hold a Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch.) degree. The rigorous program requires students to take 25 courses from a list of prerequisites and electives. The Ph.D. program has two tracks: (1) history and theory and (2) technology. The history and theory track is an interdisciplinary program that focuses on the relationship between architecture and related fields, such as urbanism, landscape, and building technology. The degree requires students to take two years of coursework and independent study, after which they begin their dissertation. Students must pass two foreign language exams, which generally include French, German, Spanish, or Italian. In 2014, the School launched the new architectural technology Ph.D. track for computation and energy. The track focuses on new techniques in computation and energy/environmental performance. The program is supported by Princeton's School of Engineering and Applied Science. While the first two years of coursework are similar to the Ph.D. in History and Theory, the Ph.D. in Technology requires students to concentrate in a particular subfield of technology. Facilities and Research =School of Architecture Building= The School of Architecture building was dedicated in 1963. In 2007, New York City architecture firm ARO designed the first significant addition to the building since it was first constructed. =Embodied Computation Lab= The Embodied Computation Lab, located off the School of Architecture grounds proper, is a teaching and research facility dedicated to the interface between computation and design and the development of knowledge in the fields of digital fabrication and remote sensing. It combines architectural and engineering experimentation to utilize computation design, digital fabrication, and sophisticated sensing, actuation, and control electronics that make the Lab a center for interdisciplinary design exploration and prototyping. Over 5,000 square feet of space is available for heavier fabrication work, hands-on material experiments, and the construction of full-scale mock-ups. Also housed within the Lab are facilities for building in wood, plastic, metal, and concrete that enable students to learn general model theory, build and test models of actual buildings, and study current building systems and technology. The Lab serves a project space for developing and testing large-scale architecture and engineering prototypes inside and outside or as facade elements. Additionally, it serves as a state of the art research environment with digital fabrication equipment for full-scale material prototyping, such as a water jet cutter, large-scale metal laser cutters, multi-use robotic arm platforms for milling, additive fabrication and human machine collaboration for research in construction, and an electronics workbench for the development of sensing and control and physical computing applications. In 2017, the Lab won the 2017 Best of Design Awards for Green - Civic from The Architect's Newspaper. =VSL Woodshop= The VSL Woodshop, located in the basement of the Architecture Building, is a small but well- equipped 24-hour accessible shop maintained and monitored by the School of Architecture Shop Monitor program. =School of Architecture Library= The School of Architecture Library opened in 1964 as the Library for Urban and Environmental Studies, with the Bureau of Urban Research constituting its charter collection. Today, the library, still familiarly referred to as UES, is one of fourteen libraries within the Princeton University Library system. The collection‚Äôs strengths include modern and contemporary architecture and urban design, architectural history, theory, and practice. Additionally, the Library supports green design, sustainable architecture, social factors in design, architecture and the visual arts, architecture in developing countries, landscape architecture and building technology. Together, with the resources housed throughout the Princeton University Libraries, the School of Architecture Library provides access to a comprehensive collection supporting the fields of architecture, architectural research and theory, urban planning and design.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Description and history The William H. Thompson Farmstead is located in rural northeastern East Windsor's Melrose area, on the north side of Melrose Road at its junctions with East Road and Pease Road. It consists of , legally separated into two parcels. Set facing the Melrose Road on either side of Pease Road are a c. 1850 Greek Revival farmhouse (to the right) and a more modest Bungalow style house (to the left) built in 1917. Behind the farmhouse stand two barns and a pumphouse, all of 19th-century construction, while a small period garage stands behind the Bungalow house. The land in this area was probably first cultivated by colonial settlers in the 17th century, when it was part of Windsor. The Thompson family were among those first settlers, and one of their descendants, William H. Thompson, built the Greek Revival farmhouse around 1850. Thompson was a prominent local leader, serving as tax assessor and town selectman for some years, and also serving for two years in the state legislature. He was instrumental in the establishment and construction of the Broad Brook Congregational Church, where he also held many titles. In 1900 he sold the farmstead to John Pease, whose family owned it until 1957. The Bungalow was built in 1917 for his sisters Laura and Zeba.

As he was interested in propagating his idea through publication, later he became the agent of newly-founded Islamic magazines such as Al-Imam in Singapore and Al-Ittihad in Cairo. In 1906, he moved to Padang for becoming a lecturer, replacing his uncle after his death. In Padang, he held Tabligh Akbar (mass religious meeting), which eventually led to the founding of Jamaah Adabiyah, a religious circle which conducted Pengajian (religious mentoring). Pengajian was held twice every week, moving around different houses. Seeing the insufficiency of systematic religious education upon all the youths in Padang, Abdullah decided to open a religious school in 1909. He was also an active author. Later he established Al-Munir magazine which modeled after Al-Imam in 1911 and became a journalist based in Padang in 1914. He also maintained tight network throughout the religious schools in Padang, Jakarta and able to extract support from the youth organization Jong Sumatranen Bond. Utilizing this network, he helped to establish Sumetera Thawalib, one of the first modernist mass organizations in West Sumatra. His depth in the religious knowledge was recognized among the Middle Eastern scholars, and he attended the Cairo Caliphate Congress in 1926 where people discussed the aftermath of the abolition of the Caliphate. During the time, he received the honorable degree from Al-Azhar University. References Bibliography * Merle Calvin Ricklefs (2001). A History of Modern Indonesia Since C. 1200.

The war started just after the death of Kasym Khan. Background In the early 16th Century Kasym Khan had united all tribes and nations of Eastern Cumania into one state ‚Äî the Kazakh Khanate. It was a regional superpower, which could withstand a war with any neighboring country. However the unity of the khanate relied on Kasym Khan's personal authority, and after his death an internecine war started between descendants of Janibek Khan for the throne. This war named after civil war between Janibek's descendants. History Kasim-khan's heir, Mamash Khan, was unable to resist the Nogai Horde, which conquered the territory of the Torgay River. After Mamash Khan's death, during the reign of Taiyr Khan, the Oirat invasion of the Kazakh Khanate began. Taiyr Khan failed to suppress powerful sultans of the Kazakh Khanate, such rulers as Zhetysu Buydash Khan, ruler of Sighnaq Ahmet. Taiyr Khan was defeated by the ruler of Moghulistan, Keldi- Muhammad, and fled to Kyrgyzstan, where he died. Then, Tughum Khan became the new ruler of Kazakh lands. But his government was not recognized by Zhetysu Buydash, ruler of Sygnak Ahmet, and both declared themselves as khans. The son of Kasym Khan, Sultan Hak-Nazar, the ruler of Sozak, recognized Tugim as khan. Ahmet began a campaign against the Nogai horde. Ultimately, he was defeated by the Nogais and was captured by them with fifteen of his sons. In 1535, Ahmet was killed by Orak Baghatur. Sultan Hak-Nazar captured Ahmet's territories. The western border of the Khanate passed through the Aral Sea. Sultan Hak- Nazar inflicted a crushing defeat on Buydash Khan, who fled to Moghulistan. Hak-Nazar got the western part of Zhetysu. In 1538, after the death of Tugim Khan, Khak-Nazar became khan and the civil war ended in his victory. Results The Kazakh Khanate reached inner unity. Nevertheless it had lost nearly half of their territory - Western Kazakhstan was captured by the Nogai Horde, Eastern Kazakhstan by Four Oirat, Northern - by the Khanate of Sibir, Moghulistan obtained Western Zhetusy whilst the Khanate of Bukhara got Tashkent.

At the time of its nomination the district consisted of five resources, including one contributing building, two contributing sites, one contributing structure, and one non-contributing building. The Chariton Cemetery Company was incorporated in 1864 as a private cemetery. It was sold to the city for $10,000 in 1924. That same year they hired Des Moines landscape architect Ray F. Wyrick to plan the landscaping and for future expansion. The plan he came up with was the rural cemetery concept. He replaced its formal garden design with curving roadways and waterways that reflected its natural setting. Babyland for infant burials was created in 1930. He also designed the north entrance gate, which was built with Works Progress Administration funds in 1937. Wyrick continued to work with the cemetery into the 1960s. An English cottage-style building was built in 1929 as a rest house/chapel. It was designed and built by local contractor E.H. Best. It features a brick exterior with stucco trim, and half-timbering in the gable end. Its exposed rafter ends are elements of the American Craftsman style.

He has been regarded as one of the leading theologians in the Presbyterian Church of the 1800s, and an important metaphysician. Early life Yeomans was born January 7, 1800 in Hinsdale, Massachusetts. His first vocation was as a blacksmith's apprentice, though he bought out his apprenticeship so that he may begin to study theology. Yeomans' initial education began under Reverend Cummings of Albany, New York, and he supported himself by teaching classes during the day and night. Around 1820 he moved to Williamstown, Massachusetts where he attended Williams College, graduating in 1824 as second in his class. He stayed with the college until 1827 as a tutor before attending Andover Theological Seminary to complete his studies in theology. Career Yeomans was ordained in November 1828 and first served as pastor to a small congregation he helped create in North Adams, Massachusetts. Because of its proximity to Williams College many of the members in this congregation were individuals he worked with while at the school. Before he was ordained, Yeomans held a successful fundraiser in the town to construct a new church for the congregation he would soon lead. This church opened on November 12, 1828, and upon its completion Yeomans was installed as its first pastor. He stayed with this congregation until 1832 when he accepted a call to preach at the First Congregational Church in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. After two more years he moved on again to preach at the First Presbyterian Church of Trenton, New Jersey, taking over for Rev. James Waddel Alexander. He served from 1834 to 1841, and in 1838 was involved in the construction of the third church on the property following previous damage from a lightning strike. On May 6, 1841 Yeomans accepted an offer from Lafayette College to become its second president. During his tenure Yeomans was active in helping to accept black students and Native Americans to the college, and himself taught courses titled \\"Moral and Mental Philosophy\\" and \\"Evidences of Christianity.\\" After only three years he resigned from his position on September 19, 1844. After the presidency at Lafayette, Yeomans served the rest of his career as pastor of the Mahoning Presbyterian Church in Danville, Pennsylvania. In 1860 he was chosen as the moderator of the General Assembly of the Old School Presbyterian Church where he called for a national day of prayer to be held on January 4, 1861. Personal life Yeomans married Laetitia Snyder of Albany in 1828, with whom he had two daughters and three sons. Two of his sons became Presbyterian ministers themselves. In 1841 Yeomans received three honorary Doctor of Divinity degrees from The College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), Williams College, and Miami University. He was a prolific writer to both the Biblical Repertory and The Princeton Review, the latter to which he wrote twenty articles. Yeomans died on June 22, 1863 in Danville, Pennsylvania.

He was the first person to discover and describe the usage of cross-bedding in geological stratification to show the 'way up' of rock layers, a discovery overlooked until its independent rediscovery over 70 years later. Life and career Ganly was born in the Rotunda Hospital, Dublin, on 15 October 1809 to Ann and Patrick Ganly. His father was a bricklayer. In 1827 he joined Richard Griffith's boundary survey of Ireland, which had begun two years earlier as a precursor to the first Ordnance Survey of Ireland. He was to work a number of years with Griffith as his boss. Between 1830 and 1832 he worked directly for the Ordnance Survey. In 1841 he began study through Trinity College, Dublin, gaining a BA in 1849. Griffith became Commissioner of Valuation and Ganly worked under him in his role as a valuator. From 1846‚Äì9 during the great famine years, Ganly was engaged in famine relief under the auspices of the Board of Works, of which Griffith had become chairman. He returned to valuation work in 1853, by which time he had married Mary Elizabeth (Eliza) [maiden name unknown]. He was made redundant from valuation work in 1860. It has been suggested that he may have worked in the US in the early 1850s and worked as a civil engineer in Ireland after 1860. Ganly's sketch of cross-stratification at Carndonagh, Co.Donegal, Ireland. The bottom shows the direction of river flow (enhanced in red) with the deposited sediment (enhanced in orange) on one side the ripples (c to d). The top shows a cross-section through the riverbed sediment. Ganly's sketch of rocks on the shoreline at Coosnagloor, near Mount Eagle on the Dingle peninsula, Co.Kerry, Ireland. The top part of the sketch shows a tightly- folded syncline: north to south the rocks get younger, then the bedding is inverted past the syncline trough. The bottom part details the cross- stratification which helped to indicate the original 'way up' of the rock. Contributions to geology and cartography In the early 1830s, Ganly had sketched how the ripples of sediment left by a Donegal river north of Carndonagh had resulted in an undulating cross-sectional pattern. In 1838, at Coosnagloor on the Dingle Peninsula, he made further sketches, noticing cross- bedding in sedimentary rocks along the shore, and as he moved southwards the rocks appeared to be getting younger. At the very southern end, however, the bedding appeared inverted (see illustrations). He correctly interpreted this as synclinal folding. He had discovered a way of showing which way up the stratification had originally occurred. In 1856, he read his first paper as a new member of the Geological Society of Dublin in which he detailed his discovery of 18 years before concerning the orientation of cross-bedding in rocks. It was not well-received, but his paper was published in the Society journal the following year. The true depth of Ganly's contribution to geology, the mapping of Ireland, and ‚Äì through his valuation work ‚Äì Irish genealogy, was largely unknown until the twentieth Century. In the 1940s, volumes of communications from Ganly to Griffith were found. Hundreds of letters sent over more than a decade detailed Ganly's fieldwork from at least 1837. After the production of the four-miles-to-one-inch maps, Griffith was lauded for their excellence, receiving the Wollaston Medal and a Baronetcy for this and other work, but the significant increase in precision over his own previous maps, due to Ganly's expertise in the field, was not credited by Griffith. Similarly, Griffith's geological papers relied very significantly on Ganly's on-the-spot interpretations but the latter was not cited. Eliza Ganly died on 5 January 1894 and was buried at Prospect Cemetery; Patrick Ganly died on 29 October 1899 at 52 Main Street, Donnybrook, Dublin, and was buried at the same cemetery ‚Äì unmarked ‚Äì in the grave of Elizabeth Leary. Legacy Though not recognised by established geologists in his lifetime, Ganly's methodology, which is now standard practice, was rediscovered in the 1910s in the USA. Researchers in the mid and late twentieth centuries lifted his memory somewhat to its proper status in the history of geology and cartography ‚Äì if only in the geological world: he has been described as \\"Ireland's greatest, but least well-known, geologist\\".

Early life and education Swarts was born in Paris; her family moved to Connecticut when she was a toddler. She did her undergraduate studies at Pomona College. Her plan going into college was to work with animals; at Pomona, professors James J. McKenna and Rachel N. Levin showed her alternative tracks for this than zookeeping and veterinary science. She graduated in 1994, majoring in biological anthropology, a self-designed plan of study combining the fields of her two mentors. Before her work with ocelots in Texas, she also studied \\"bay wrens in Panama, howler monkeys in Belize, monkeys in Surinam, island foxes in California and mountain gorillas in Rwanda\\". In one incident during this period, a silverback gorilla sat on her head for ten minutes. Returning to graduate study, she completed a Ph.D. in ecology, specializing in conservation biology, at the University of California, Davis. Work with the Fish and Wildlife Service After completing her doctorate, Swarts took a desk job with the Fish and Wildlife Service. She transferred to her current position at Laguna Atascosa in October 2013. Although ocelots can be found in 22 countries, their available habitat has been reduced by development. The south of Texas, where Swarts works, and the south of Arizona are the only parts of the United States where ocelots live and breed in the wild, both in parklands and on private property. However, as Swarts has documented, many have died from automobile collisions. Swarts has worked with the Texas Department of Transportation in the establishment of underpasses beneath the roadways, so that ocelots and other wildlife can cross in safety. Her work with the ocelots also involves tracking them with GPS collars, and trapping them to give them their collars. In 2016, she was involved in the discovery of a den of ocelot kittens, the first such den to be found in the US in 20 years.

An eclipsing binary, its visual apparent magnitude has a maximum of 8.71, fading to 9.98 during primary eclipse and 9.42 during secondary eclipse. From its brightness, it's estimated to be around 6,000 light-years (1,800 parsecs) away from Earth. Parallax measurements from Gaia Data Release 2 yield a similar distance of around . SV Centauri is a contact binary made of two hot B-type stars with spectral types of B1V and B6.5III and effective temperatures of 23,000 and 14,000 K. The primary component, the brighter star with 11,700 times the solar luminosity, is the less massive one with 7.7 times the solar mass and has a radius of 6.8 times the solar radius. The secondary component has a mass equal to 9.6 solar masses, radius of 7.4 solar radii and a brightness 1,900 times larger than the Sun's. The separation between the center of each star is only 15.3 solar radii. The system is viewed from a high inclination of 81.8¬∞. The orbital period of SV Centauri is monotonically decreasing at a very fast mean rate of 2.1 seconds per year, the largest rate for any known system. The first observations of the system, in 1894, revealed a period of 1.6606 days, which decreased to 1.6581 days in 1993, showing a decrease rate that is variable with time, but with time intervals of 10-30 years when it is constant. The transition between such intervals of constant change can be accompanied by very fast decreases in the period, such as of 15 seconds per year in 1975. The most probable explanation for the period decrease is mass transfer from the less massive to the more massive star and subsequent mass loss through the L3 Lagrangian point of the system, which is located on the outer side of the more massive star. The mass loss causes loss of angular momentum, which is compensated by a decrease in the separation between the stars. In this model, the system is losing mass at a rate of about 5 solar masses per year; the variation of this rate causes the variation in the rate of period decrease. The alternative possibility is mass transfer from the more massive to the less massive star, which naturally tends to decrease the orbital period. This may create an accretion disk around the less massive star, similar to Beta Lyrae.

Because of her association with Thomas Picton, the governor of Trinidad accused of abuse against a slave, she has come down in history as a seductress and sinister woman who used her wiles to manipulate the governor. A reexamination of her life indicates that she was an astute businesswoman who was successful in enlarging her fortunes over at least three decades. Early life Records of Smith's early life are limited. She was rumoured to be a mulattress of French extraction and was in her twenties when Thomas Picton became governor of Trinidad in 1797. She was also reputed to have been married and left her spouse because of his financial difficulties. By 1798, she had become Picton's mistress and the couple would have four children together. Career Smith appears with regularity in the Books of Spanish Protocols of Port of Spain, which were the business transaction records held over from the Spanish colonial rule. The books were in use until 1813, when the British replaced them with their own recordkeeping system. The Protocols and Slave Registers show that she lived in Port of Spain, in an urban environment rather than on a plantation. From the time of Picton's arrival in Port of Spain, she and he engaged in slave catching, which was both legal and lucrative. Though she traded in property, the majority of her income came from the buying, selling and manumission of slaves. Because of her association with Picton, Smith was often vilified by his detractors. Picton, though a competent military officer, ruled through fear and brutality. After torturing a fourteen-year-old girl by picketing her for theft in 1801, he was removed as Governor of Trinidad in 1803 and returned to England to stand trial. The main accuser of Picton, was William Fullarton, who had been appointed as part of a commission to look into the running of Trinidad. Fullarton and the pamphleteer Pierre McCallum widely reported that Smith was the instigator of Picton's cruelty, putting forth the view that the governor was under her influence. In his report, Fullarton accused Picton and Smith of jailing, punishing and starving maroons and runaways for petty offences and then conducting clandestine sales of them to friends for minimal purchase prices. In actuality, the two had a contract with Antonio Vallecilla, an operative of the Intendant of Caracas, who used his cover as an international slave catcher to conduct surveillance on the British. Among the unscrupulous business practices Fullarton's accusation against Picton included were that Picton granted a contract to supply the soldiers with wood and sundries to \\"Mrs. Rosetta Smith, a Woman of Colour, who lived with him\\". Rumours then surfaced that she used the money from the contract to purchase a bordello, which she used to entertain influential men and elicit secrets from them which she reported to Picton. Further using her influence, she was accused of eliciting bribes from prisoners to secure reductions in their sentences and holding weekly salons to dole out her favors. In one instance, she was accused of using military forces to evict a widow and her two daughters from a home that she wanted to purchase. Smith's side of the story was that the widow had agreed to sell, but later tried to renegotiate the transaction for more money and alleged that they and not Smith were the aggrieved parties. When the women complained to the Colonial Office, no action was taken against Smith, perhaps suggesting that her story was credible. Smith was not tried for any of the claims made against her. The only charge in the many claims that Fullarton leveled against Picton which was tried was whether using torture to solicit a confession was contrary to the law in force. He was found guilty, but had the verdict overturned in a later trial. Long after Picton left Trinidad, a business relationship between him and Smith flourished and he left bequests to his four children by her in his will. Despite claims by Fullarton that Smith was unsavory and reviled, she continued to build her business in the slave trade with prominent local businesswomen and men including the Congnet and Philip families. Records in the Protocols and Slave Registers show that by 1813, Smith owned 32 personal slaves. She used various names in the record books, including Rosetta Smith, Rene Rosetta Picton and Rosetta Picton. She also conducted business with Bartholomew Dwyer, a prosperous, free black attorney, purchasing slaves with him and jointly owning a 350-acre plantation, La Belle Fille, in the Quarter of Santa Cruz. They did not produce goods for export on the plantation, but rather used it to grow their own provisions, avoiding the costly import fees typically charged on food. Death and legacy Smith disappears from records by 1825, at which time her daughter Augusta Picton was listed as owning slaves previously owned by Smith. The eldest child of Smith and Picton, Thomas, moved to London and trained as a doctor, Richard married in Trinidad and remained there until at least 1834. Frederick‚Äôs only mention is in the 1816 will of his father. Smith is still recounted in local newspaper articles in Trinidad which characterize her as the malevolent figure portrayed by Fullarton and McCallum. More recent scholarship by Kit Candlin, and others shows that she was largely used to add fuel to the animosity between Picton and Fullarton and that no real evidence of her character exists. That she was able to expand her business from Port of Spain to Grenada and Venezuela, and do business with prominent white men, long after Picton left the island in 1803, shows that she was an astute entrepreneur with a large network of influential partners. Her adaptability to changing colonial rule and savvy to exploit gaps in the organization system, despite the Colonial government discouraging blacks from engaging in \\"entrepreneurship\\", led her to become one of the most successful businesswomen in the southern Caribbean.

Eventually the collection of tens of thousands of volumes, with hundreds of thousands of images, grew too large for their house, and the company moved to a small office near Blackheath station; after a few years there, still growing, it moved again to larger premises, the former parish hall of All Saints' Blackheath. Mary Evans embraced technological change and continued to innovate, and by the time of her death the company employed 14 people, had a website containing nearly one million images, and an annual turnover of over ¬£1 million. Together with Hilary, Mary Evans wrote several books featuring images from the library, including The Party that Lasted 100 Days: the Late Victorian Season (1976) and The Man who Drew the Drunkard's Daughter: the Life and Art of George Cruikshank (1978). They co-edited The Picture Researchers' Handbook, up until its eighth edition. Later life Mary Evans died on 29 June 2010, at Riverlee Nursing Home, Greenwich. Hilary Evans died on 27 July 2011. They were survived by their daughter, Valentine Evans.

She was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame.  Biography  Spencer was born in 1842, in Pontiac, Michigan, to her father John A. Wilson. She married Clinton Spencer, a soldier in the American Civil War, in 1863. The Library of Michigan appointed her an assistant librarian in 1885, following her move from Ypsilanti, Michigan to Lansing, Michigan. The library subsequently made her the head librarian on March 3, 1893; making Spencer the first Michigan State Librarian born outside of New England. Spencer was a very progressive librarian, allowing access to the general public when previously it had been restricted to state officials. She grew the general library from 60,000 volumes to 300,000 volumes. In additional efforts to open the library to the public, Spencer created a system of associate libraries (eventually totaling 60) in where a person could place a request for books from the State Library, and they would be shipped to the local library. In 1895, Michigan was the second state to create a system of traveling libraries, of which Spencer was a large proponent. Largely through her efforts, by 1902 there were over 700 traveling libraries with over 170,000 volumes. The program of traveling libraries, though eventually discontinued led to about 20 cities in Michigan creating public libraries. While still serving the library, she died on August 22, 1923. Spencer was awarded an honorary M.A. from the University of Michigan in 1905, and an honorary Master of Pedagogy from the Ypsilanti State Normal School.

First taking up singing in a church choir, she quit her job when she was 19 years old to pursue a career as a vocalist. Beginning with support from other established musicians, M'Pongo eventually began writing her own compositions, often utilising feminist themes.  Biography  = Early life = Aimee Fran√ßoise M'Pongo Langu was born on 27 August 1956 in Boma, Belgian Congo, the second daughter in a family of seven children. Her father, Gilbert Pongo, was a soldier, while her mother was the director of a girls' education center. At the age of four M'Pongo contracted polio and was paralysed by a shot of penicillin. She crawled until she was trained to use a prosthesis in 1962, allowing her to walk. As a child, M'Pongo attended a church where her father was a cantor and began singing for the choir. M'Pongo also sang in her secondary school choir and, when she graduated, she moved to Kinshasa and enrolled in a shorthand typing course. Afterwards she took a job as an executive secretary at a firm. Outside of her regular work she looked for show-business contracts, introducing herself as M'Pongo Love, a nickname her parents had reportedly used for her since her childhood. = Musical career = In December 1975 when she was 19 years of age, M'Pongo met saxophonist Empompo Loway, who resolved to help her develop a singing career and persuaded her to leave her secretary job. After an initial failure to secure M'Pongo patronage, the two met band manager Ngwango Isionoma, who agreed to supply them with money to start her career. Loway assisted her in forming a band, Tcheke Tcheke Love, and composed her first songs. M'Pongo debuted with the song \\"Pas possible Maty\\" and soon thereafter delivered her first concert at the Cin√© Palladium in Kinshasa. Throughout 1977 she performed with an additional backing group, Les Ya tupa‚Äôs (with members such as Ray Lema, F√©lix Manuaku Waku, and Alfred Nzimbi), singing compositions by Mayaula Mayoni, Simaro Lutumba, and Souzy Kaseya. Her rendition of Mayaula's \\"Ndaya\\" became a hit success in Kinshasa, especially among local women. M'Pongo soon began composing and arranging her own music. In 1980 she ended her professional relationship with Empompo to work independently, subsequently moving to Paris. She later produced music under her own label, \\"Love‚Äôs Music\\". Later in life she contracted cerebral meningitis in Gabon. She was at her home in Binza, Kinshasa, planning to make a career comeback when her condition worsened and in December 1989 she was admitted to a local clinic. Her older brother told the media that she had suffered a \\"strong attack\\", not specifying her illness. She died on 15 January 1990 and was survived by three daughters.  Style and themes  M'Pongo sang in a clear, slightly nasal voice and utilised precise intonations. During her performances she braced herself on the sides of the stage to compensate for her physical disability. Compared to her contemporaries, M'Pongo was the most feminist of all women soukous singers and actively criticised polygamy and the practice of keeping mistresses in her music. In a 1989 interview she explained her feminist views: > I sing about women's problems, I try to give them courage...and I will stop > singing when the relations between men and women in Africa become problem > free. But what African man doesn't have a mistress? In addition to a hard > life, women have a lot to endure. I have a feminist duty to see they fight, > that they defend themselves, that they hold their heads high, that they take > independent women as examples...We must know how to say what we are, we > African women, without fearing all the modernism we need to assimilate.

Written by Dana Horgan and Leah Fongand directed by Antonio Negret, it premiered on ABC in the United States on March 23, 2018. In the episode, Rogers helps Tilly when she is accused of murder, Ivy hopes to make amends with Anastasia, and Regina enlists Lucy‚Äôs help to find out the truth about Samdi. In the past, Alice encounters a new soulmate. Plot =Opening sequence= The troll‚Äôs statue is featured in the background. =In the Characters' Past= In the new realm during a flashback, Alice makes a birthday wish to get out of the tower and shortly after, a troll suddenly appears and helps her escape the prison, hopefully to search for her father. Years later, Alice, who is still seeking out her father, is caught spying on the resistance group by Robin, who had just recently arrived to the New Enchanted Forest. Robin intends to honor her father's legacy by hunting down the troll, who has since been destroying villages, but Alice goes after her to protect it, calling it a \\"friend\\" since it had rescued her. When they finally confront the troll, Robin is ready to kill it but Alice steps in to save him, infuriating the villagers. However, in a surprise twist, Robin ends up shielding Alice from the villagers, and uses magic to summon Emma's Yellow Bug, which transports them to the Tower, where Alice admits that she wanted to go back but now wants to experience freedom. Suddenly, the troll appears and begins destroying the Tower. Robin theorizes that Alice, by means of her wish, unintentionally created the troll to free herself. Alice then confronted the troll, calmed him, and forgave him before he, clutching the car, is turned into stone (the same stone statue that she, as Tilly, hangs out on in Hyperion Heights). Afterwards, Robin makes Alice make another wish on a birthday candle, and they bid the tower goodbye, beginning a journey together. =In The Present Day= Days after the death of the baker at the hospital, Rogers tracks Tilly down, just in time to keep the officers from finding her, and are later joined by Henry as they start looking for signs of evidence of Tilly being elsewhere during the time of the murder to clear her name. At first, while taking refuge at Henry‚Äôs apartment and hopefully find a clue, she retraces her steps after she sees a sticker on her shoe sole. Tilly grows frustrated when she finds that no one can remember seeing her at the places she had visited. As Tilly is becoming more convinced that she might be a murderer after she discovers the snipped hair locks in her backpack, she runs away from Henry's home. She visits her troll statue, saying goodbye to it, as she plans to run away. She almost gets hit by an SUV when she is rescued by a woman named Margot (Robin in this cursed realm), and she thanks her, which Margot responds to by convincing her not to run away. Tilly also notices that Margot is reading ‚ÄúAlice in Wonderland,‚Äù which Margot tells her is a favorite of hers. When Rogers tells Tilly that she‚Äôll have to turn herself in, Tilly discovers a surveillance camera hidden inside the troll's eye that can provide an alibi for her. When Tilly returns to her place, Rogers stopped by to ask her about staying at his place, and she accepts. Meanwhile, Regina and Lucy put their plans to free Henry of his curse in motion but Regina wants to leave some of the details to herself and not share it with Zelena yet. Regina asks Samdi out on a date as a cover, so that Lucy can break into his suite to look for clues as to what he seeks in Hyperion Heights. However Zelena suddenly finds out and becomes concerned for Lucy‚Äôs safety, prompting Regina to text Lucy to leave immediately before Samdi returns. Moments later, Lucy escapes upon seeing the text but Samdi catches on when he finds Lucy‚Äôs hat. Lucy does manage to photograph a Tarot card layout that she shows to Regina, and when Samdi visits the bar to let her know about what she did, Regina demands an answer from him about the cards, and he details a future that will determine a new love in her life, but at the same time she will have to let him seek out his quest, which is acquiring the Dark One's Dagger that Weaver currently has in his possession, a move that doesn‚Äôt sit well with Regina. Later, Regina comes clean to Zelena about this situation, as Zelena‚Äôs daughter Robin (Margot) returns to her, with Zelena remarking to Regina that it truly is hard to interact with your child under cursed circumstances.

She graduated medical college in 1923, being the 2nd woman to graduate with a medical degree from the Tokyo Women's Medical College . Career After returning to Korea, she interned at the Viceroyalty Hospital of Chosun in Seoul and married Kim, Tak- Won, an internal medicine/ neupsychiatrist specialist in 1925. They had two daughters and one son together. Kil and her husband separated for three years to pursue further education with her returning to Tokyo and him to Peking, China. Upon their return to Korea, they met an American missionary physician, Rosetta Hall. Dr. Hall has expressed to Dr. Kil the dire need for women physicians in Korea, as many women were apprehensive about seeing male doctors and many died due to lack of medical care. As such,to satisfy the need for female physicians in Korea, Drs. Kil, Hall and Kim founded the Chosun Women's Medical Training Institute in 1928. In its early years, Dr. Kil served as associate dean and lecturer in obstetrics/gynecology and pediatrics. After's Hall's retirement in 1933, Kim and Kil expanded the offerings so that they were equivalent to those taught in four-year medical schools. To meet the school's financial needs, Drs. Kil and Kim had to aggressively lobby prominent members of the Korean community, while facing opposition from both a male- dominated medical field and the ruling Japanese government. Despite their challenges, by 1938 the school had an enrollment of 64 students, had been elevated to college level and renamed the Seoul Women's Medical Training Institute. However, once the Chosun Women's Medical Training Institute had been established as a college, Dr. Kil and Dr. Kim were prohibited from being members of faculty as punishment of their previous anti-Japanese activities. The college was taken over by the Japanese who then disfavored the enrollment of Korean students. Kim died the following year and Kil started her own private practice until she retired in 1964. During this time, she served as president of the Korean Women's Medical Asscociation and served as chief physician to the Korean Royal Family. She was also an instructor at the Ewha Womans University. Awards and recognition In 1959, the Korean minister of public health recognized her significant contributions to Korean medical education. In 1960, she was named a dedicated public servant by the City of Seoul and in 1961 she was acknowledged by the Ewha Women's University as a pioneer in the medical education of women. Later life She emigrated in 1979 to be with her daughter and died in Cheltenham, Pennsylvania in 1990.Ogilvie & Harvey, pp. 1459‚Äì61 Notes References * 1899 births 1990 deaths South Korean women physicians 20th-century South Korean physicians ","title":"Kil Chung-hee"},{"id":"55926282","text":"Miaodao (, died after 1134) was a Chinese Buddhist abbess and master, l√ºshi.

Life Born in Lewisham, then part of Kent, Reeves became interested in women's suffrage, and joined the Women's Freedom League (WFL) in 1909. She gradually came to prominence in the group, and by 1918 was the secretary of its branch in Kensington. By this time, the group had broadened its interests to campaign on a wide range of feminist issues. During the 1920s, Reeves became involved with the WFL's publishing section, the Minerva Publishing Company, and in the middle of the decade she became the manager of the Minerva Club, the WFL's residential club in Brunswick Square. This suffrage offshoot had been founded by Dr Elizabeth Knight and Alice Green. The club was used for meetings but also acted as a hostel for suffrage activists and fund-raising annual birthday parties were organised for Charlotte Despard. Despard travelled from Ireland each year to attend. The club was in the heart of Bloomsbury, and Reeves befriended many of the Bloomsbury Set. She also came to know many other residents of the area, and during World War II she founded the London Emergency Apartment Keepers' Society (LEAKS) to support the many local owners of boarding houses and hotels. Reeves served on the national executive of the WFL for many years, and eventually became the organisation's president. She sat on many committees, including those of the Equal Pay Campaign, the Association for Moral and Social Hygiene, the Open Door Council, the Nationality Married Women Committee and the Women Peers Committee. She sat on the United Nations Association's women's advisory council, and was a vice- chair of the British Commonwealth League, the Status of Women Committee, and the Suffragette Fellowship. She regularly attended congresses of the International Alliance of Women, and it was in 1961, while travelling in Ireland following a congress, that she died.

It is the first church built in Cachoeira as part of the Adorno family sugar plantation and is home to the Brotherhood of Our Lady of Help (Irmandade de Nossa Senhora da Ajuda). The chapel attracts a large number of pilgrims devoted to Our Lady of Help. The chapel was listed as a historic structure by National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN) in 1939. History √Ålvaro Rodrigues Celestino Adorno, son of Ant√¥nio Dias Adorno, built a chapel on a hill dedicated to Our Lady of the Rosary between 1595 and 1606. Jo√£o Rodrigues Adorno, great-grandson and heir of the properties of √Ålvaro Adorno, rebuilt the church between 1673 and 1687. The chapel was rebuilt using stone and lime. Father Miguel de Ara√∫jo Adorno, son of John R. Adorno, celebrated the first Mass of the new chapel in October 1686, apparently prior to its completion. The church became associated with the Fraternity of S√£o Pedro dos Cl√©rigos in this period; the extinction of the order provoked the abandoned of the church. Musicians from the Brotherhood of Our Lady of Help visited the church in 1872 and became associated with the church. Location The Chapel of Our Lady of Help sits atop a hill within Cachoeira and is approached by three steeply sloped streets. Its frontispiece faces west towards the Paragua√ßu River. The chapel sits as part of a complex of numerous sobrados of the sugar mill of the Adorno family. The much larger Parish Church of Our Lady of the Rosary was completed at the base of the Ladeira da Ajuda by the beginning of the 18th century. The chapel was once a focal point of Cachoeira, due to its placement on a hill, but is now surrounded by the urban growth of the city. Structure The Chapel of Our Lady of Help is notable in Bahia for the simplicity of its design and proportions. It consists of a nave, chancel, sacristy, porch, and bell tower. The church has a simple, central portal of wood with a window on either side. The church roof is of two types: a gable roof over the nave and a cupola of tiled brick over the chancel. The bell tower and choir are accessed via an external stairway, a feature common to other early churches in Brazil. Two choir windows and an oculus sit above the porch. The church is flanked by a small pyramidal bell tower with a tin roof; it is of later construction. The interior of the chapel has images of Saint Francis of Assisi, Saint Benedict, Saint Lucia, Saint Cajetan (Saint Caetano), and Saint Peter. The pulpit is surmounted by a stone stair. The chapel is noted for its porch, which is covered by a sloping roof and surrounded by a wooden railing; the porch was once a closed narthex to the church. Chapels with a porch of this type in Bahia are only found in churches built in the 16th and 17th century; its design closely resembles that of Chapel of Our Lady of the Ladder (Capela de Nossa Senhora da Escada) in Salvador and the Chapel of Saint Joseph of Jenipapo (Capela de S√£o Jos√© do Jenipapo) in Castro Alves. The church portal is accessed from the porch and has a low window on either side. The small attached hall to the right of the building dates to the 19th century. Protected status The Chapel of Our Lady of Help was listed as a historic structure by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage in 1939. Both the structure and its contents were included in the IPHAN directive under inscription number 198.

It was the first of two invitational World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) competitions in the 2002‚Äì03 season. The host broadcaster was BBC Scotland.

Overview The Scottish Masters was an invitational professional snooker tournament first contested in 1981. The 2002 competition was the first of two World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) invitational events of the 2002‚Äì03 season, the other being the 2003 Masters. It was held at the Thistle Hotel in Glasgow, Scotland, from 24 to 29 September and featured a 12-player main draw. Sponsored by the cigarette brand Regal, it had a prize fund of ¬£205,000; the host broadcaster was BBC Scotland. The 2002 competition was the last due to the loss of tobacco sponsorship. The world top eight players were invited to the main draw and were seeded according to their final positions in the world rankings. The tournament's defending champion John Higgins was the first seed. Four competitors were given wild cards to enter the tournament: they were the 2002 Masters and Welsh Open champion Paul Hunter, Mark King, Jimmy White, and the champion of the 16-player Scottish Masters qualifying tournament and world number 22 Drew Henry. The number of maximum in a match increased from nine in the first round to eleven in the quarter and semi-finals; the final which was played to the best-of-17 frames. Before the tournament, Higgins stated that his four-month break from competing would assist his ardour and interest in the game: \\"I've moved house twice, got married and become a dad for the first time, so it's been hectic. But now things are almost back to normal. Winning the Masters was a monkey off my back because I'd lost four or five finals in Scotland. So I can't wait to get started and hopefully kick off the season with a win.\\" Tournament summary =Round 1= The first round was played from 24 to 25 September and entailed best-of-nine-frame matches. Stephen Lee, the 2002 Snooker Writers' Association Player of the Year and provisional world number one, made a of 76, a 72 and runs of 41, 40, 36 and 30 in defeating Scotland's Drew Henry 5‚Äì1. Henry won the fourth frame 60‚Äì37 but losing a 58‚Äì0 lead in the fifth due to a on a . Lee said he was pleased with the result after heavy practise over the interval. World number ten and the tournament's oldest player White won 5‚Äì4 over former world champion Ken Doherty. Trailing 2‚Äì1, Doherty compiled a century break of 112 to tie the match in frame four. He took the lead with breaks of 44 and 39 for scores of 3‚Äì2 and 4‚Äì3. White compiled breaks of 36 and 38 to force a final frame, which he won 67‚Äì40. World number nine Hunter won 5‚Äì3 against the 1999 Scottish Masters champion Matthew Stevens. Hunter led 3‚Äì0 with breaks of 101, 72 and 64 before Stevens made reply breaks of 66 and 77. The match was tied after six frames before Hunter won the next two to secure a quarter-final berth. Hunter stated that he shook \\"like a leaf\\" for much of the game and Stevens said \\"things didn‚Äôt go too well for me in this game.\\" Breaks of 84, 82, 58, 47 and 39 allowed the world number six Stephen Hendry to whitewash King 5‚Äì0 in 90 minutes. Afterwards he said: \\"The first three or four frames were pretty good. It was a bit scrappy towards the end but getting the result was the main thing.\\" He said he would not think of his next match against world champion Peter Ebdon as seeking revenge for his loss to him in the final of the 2002 world championship. =Quarter- finals= The four quarter-finals took place from 26 to 27 September as the best-of-11 frames. Ronnie O'Sullivan, a former world champion, defeated Hunter 6‚Äì3 to qualify for the semi-finals. He made two breaks of 58 and 59 to lead 3‚Äì0 before Hunter compiled reply breaks of 68 and 51 to make it 3‚Äì2. Hunter was later 4‚Äì3 behind until he failed to pot several red balls and O'Sullivan won the match. After the match, O'Sullivan criticised Hendry and his manager Ian Doyle as wanting to take control of snooker's commercial rights from the WPBSA to benefit themselves, something Doyle denied. John Higgins overcame a challenge from White to win 6‚Äì4. He started with a 2‚Äì0 lead only to trail 4‚Äì2 after White made breaks of 81, 74 and 46. Higgins compiled a 133 clearance in the seventh frame and finished the match with breaks of 55 and 95. He called it \\"a topsy-turvy game\\" and said he had thought he would be unchallenged after White's poor early performance. Lee took 103 minutes to whitewash Mark Williams 6‚Äì0 with breaks of 43, 46, 70, 122, 51 and 73; he accumulated more aggregate points than his opponent, 519‚Äì99. It was Williams' first career whitewash since he lost 5‚Äì0 to Doherty at the 1999 tournament. Lee had won against Williams for the first time in his three years playing in the tournament. Williams said he had \\"made it too easy\\" for Lee because he had left balls near the . Hendry avenged his loss to Ebdon by defeating his opponent 6‚Äì4 in the last quarter-final match. He produced a 136 to hold a 4‚Äì2 lead and later compiled a break of 87 to win the match. After the game, Hendry said that neither he nor Ebdon were at their best form because there were a large number of errors during the match. =Semi-finals= Ronnie O'Sullivan (pictured in 2015) won the Scottish Masters for the third time. Both semi- finals were held to the best-of-11 frames on 28 September. Higgins defeated Lee 6‚Äì4 with breaks of 89, 77, 72, 60 and 50 to earn the first berth in the final. Ahead 5‚Äì3, Higgins lost the ninth frame to Lee before he won the match after Lee potted a red and the simultaneously with a break of 51. Lee had compiled the tournament's highest break of 139 to overtake Hendry's 136 from the previous day. The other semi-final saw Hendry and O'Sullivan play each other. O'Sullivan took a 2‚Äì0 lead from breaks of 75 and 73 within ¬º hour. After Hendry missed a red while on a break of 65, O'Sullivan made a 69 clearance to further increase his lead by one frame. Hendry claimed three successive frames to tie the match before O'Sullivan made breaks of 76, 136 and 62 to win 6‚Äì3 and the second berth in the final. =Final= The final between Higgins and O'Sullivan on 29 September was contested over two sessions as a best-of-17 frames match. O'Sullivan led 5‚Äì1 by compiling breaks of 51, 79, 52, 65 and 43 with the solitary reply from Higgins being a 100 break in frame four. Higgins reduced his deficit to 5‚Äì4 with breaks of 48, 49 and 59. O'Sullivan then produced breaks of 43, 112, 52 and 91 to claim four frames in a row within 43 minutes and win the tournament with a 9‚Äì4 victory. It was O'Sullivan's third Scottish Masters tournament win after his victories in 1998 and 2000, and equalled a record Hendry had held. He had won his eighth competition in Scotland, his 26th from 34 finals; he earned ¬£65,000 in prize money. Higgins was runner-up for the 15th time in his career from 39 finals, and earned ¬£32,000. Lee won ¬£5,000 for producing the tournament's highest break of 139 in the semi-finals. O'Sullivan said he had been focused on improving his form by using the golfer Tiger Woods as an example. \\"He's shown the way to be professional and how hard work pays off.\\" He had gone into the tournament feeling confident because he had accumulated high breaks against his fellow players in practice. He stated he wanted to win approximately 50 to 60 championships to keep him motivated before his retirement and knew that reaching the level of Steve Davis and Hendry would be difficult. Higgins commented that O'Sullivan deserved to win the tournament, and admitted to have not taken advantage of his opportunities: \\"Even when I got back to 5‚Äì4 I couldn't put any pressure on him. I did well in these invitation events last season and not in the ranking tournaments so it would be nice if I can change that around.\\" Main draw Numbers given to the left of players' names show the seedings for the top eight players in the tournament.

The molecules that usually become allergens are intact proteins or glycoproteins. Hypoallergenic dog food diets offer a variety of protein sources that are unique by using proteins that are not recognized by the dog's antibodies as being antigens, minimizing allergic reactions. Adding novel protein sources, such as novel meats that a dog or its ancestors have never been exposed to is one method. Novel proteins can also be created by chemically modifying well known protein sources using hydrolysis techniques, rendering proteins unrecognizable by the gastrointestinal tract. Not all antigens are specific to proteins, however, and it is possible for anything that the body ingests to become an allergen. Providing diets with a limited amount of ingredients can be used for diagnostic purposes, as well as for dogs who are allergic to the common ingredients that are used in pet food. Certain nutrients are commonly incorporated into hypoallergenic dog food to help alleviate the symptoms of an allergic reaction. These ingredients include omega-3 fatty acids, Vitamins A and E, zinc, novel carbohydrates, and fiber.  Allergen responses and symptoms  Rashes are common in dogs suffering from food-related allergic reactions Allergens can elicit both immunologic and non- immunologic responses. Immunologic reactions, also known as Type 1 reactions, are caused by the binding of ingested molecules to specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. Once binding occurs, mast cell degranulation follows, releasing granules that initiate the symptoms of an allergic reaction in the body. These immunological reactions are almost instantaneous, and it is widely accepted that the molecules which bind to IgE antibodies are usually intact proteins. Non-immunologic, or non-IgE mediated reactions are less understood, but are known to present similar symptoms as immunologic reactions. These reactions can be classified under food sensitivities, and it is argued that they are not truly allergenic. Whether a reaction is truly allergenic in nature or a sensitivity, it is important that hypoallergenic dog foods provide the ingredients necessary to keep canines from experiencing discomfort. The signs of a canine food allergy or sensitivity vary greatly, but the most common to look for include rashes, swelling, itchy or tender skin, and gastrointestinal upsets. These signs are very similar to, but should not be confused with canine atopic dermatitis, which is not caused by food allergies.262x262px  Diet types  = Hydrolyzed protein diets = One of the possible causes of food allergies in dogs is a reaction of the dog's immune system to the proteins in a diet. One method that may be used to try and combat this immunologic response in dogs with food allergies is the use of hydrolyzed proteins in the diet. Whole proteins are composed of single amino acids organized into a chain, which then interact in order to fold the protein into its final three-dimensional structure. Hydrolyzed proteins are whole proteins that have been broken down into smaller polypeptides through a process called protein hydrolysis. One method of protein hydrolysis involves the use of enzymes specific to proteins called proteases. Proteases act by cleaving or cutting whole proteins at specific amino acids within their structure in order to form multiple small polypeptides from a single whole protein. Different proteases are specific to different amino acids, and as such multiple proteases may be used in order to cut a protein at several different locations. The theory behind the use of these small peptides in food as an alternative to whole proteins is that their small size will prevent them from stimulating the immune system of the gut, thereby reducing and/or preventing an allergic reaction. When hydrolyzed proteins are used in hypoallergenic canine diets it is with the hopes of avoiding an immunologic reaction both in dogs that have consumed the whole protein previously and in dogs whose intestinal tract has never seen the whole protein before but has been known to react to other protein types. = Novel protein diets = Beef, soy, chicken, turkey and egg products are commonly used ingredients in commercial dog foods as a source of protein. These protein sources have been proven to elicit an allergic response in dogs with food allergies. Novel sources of protein can be used in place of these allergenic ingredients to meet the feeding requirements for a dog, while minimizing or eliminating the chances of an allergic response. For a protein to be considered novel, it must be one that the dog has not consumed before. Novel protein sources include venison, veal, kangaroo and fish, such as salmon. = Limited ingredient diets = Introducing a food that consists of limited ingredients is a common method of reducing the occurrence of food related allergic reactions in dogs. Limited ingredient diets are made up of fewer ingredients, typically limiting the formula to one protein, carbohydrate, and/or fat.Sarah Wooten DVM, \\"What's The Purpose Of Limited Ingredient Dog Food?\\", The Idle Pup This is an attempt to improve digestion and reduce the likelihood of a reaction ensuing in dogs with sensitivities to common ingredients found in most commercial dog foods. These diets will avoid protein and carbohydrate sources, such as beef, dairy, poultry, barley, and wheat. There are many feed ingredients that have been observed to predispose animals to diet related reactions. This is due to their frequent exposure to such ingredients, which makes it likely for them to adopt sensitivities and allergies to commercial dog foods. Studies have shown that it is possible for dogs to have symptoms caused by more than one ingredient in a given diet, this makes the use of a limited ingredient diet relevant as a result of the inclusion of single protein and carbohydrate sources. If symptoms of food allergies persist after the introduction of this type of diet, it can also be helpful for determining the new allergen that is causing the adverse reaction due to the limited number of ingredients. Although these diets consist of fewer dietary ingredients, they still provide all the necessary nutrients to meet the animal's requirements.  Nutrients included in hypoallergenic diets  = Omega-3 fatty acids = Essential n-3 fatty acids in dog food help to treat the inflammation associated with allergic reactions. These essential fatty acids help to manage inflammatory responses by changing the levels of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids produced during a reaction. They also help to maintain healthy skin and to maintain cell structure. These n-3 fatty acids are usually incorporated into dog food diets by using ingredients like fish oil. = Vitamin A = Vitamin A is involved in cell growth and division, as well as hair growth and skin maintenance. Since some of the key symptoms of food allergies include damage to the skin, it is important to include Vitamin A in hypoallergenic diets to help clear up the damage done by any previous allergic reactions a dog may have had. Ingredients in dog food that function as a source of vitamin A are fish oils such as cod oil. = Vitamin E = Vitamin E is an antioxidant which has important functions in immune health. These compounds scavenge for free radicals, protecting cell membranes from damage caused by lipid oxidation. This is beneficial to have in hypoallergenic dog food diets to help maintain cell integrity in case damage does occur due to a reaction. Vitamin E is commonly found just as a vitamin supplement in diets, but it is also present in other food ingredients such as soybean oil, corn oil, olive oil, and sunflower oil. = Zinc = Zinc supplementation in hypoallergenic dog foods aids in the maintenance of skin and coat health. Zinc also plays a role in mitigating inflammatory and immune reactions. Zinc can be found supplemented as a mineral in the diet, but it can also be added in the diet through lamb meat, as this ingredient is known to be high in zinc. = Novel carbohydrates = Carbohydrates are large macronutrients which supply energy to the organism consuming them, and include nutrients such as sugars, oligosaccharides, and starches. Dogs may become sensitive or allergic to certain carbohydrate sources in their diet, and novel carbohydrates may be used in an attempt to avoid this reaction. Novel carbohydrates are carbohydrates which the dog they are being fed to has never consumed before. Some examples of novel carbohydrate ingredients include brown rice and sweet potato, as well as brewer's rice. = Fiber = Negative digestive effects that accompany dietary food allergies can be reduced by including soluble and insoluble fibers. Insoluble fibers have a relatively low fermentability, which help to decrease the negative digestive effects such as gas and soft stools. When soluble fibers are mixed with water they form a gel-like substance which helps to reduce gastric emptying in order to increase the time available for nutrients to be absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Compounds called fructooligosaccharides (FOS) are found in various soluble fibers, which aid in promoting intestinal health.Skaer Veterinary Clinic. (n.d.). Common Pet Food Ingredients. Retrieved from: http://www.skaervet.com/documents/Common%20Pet%20Food%20Ingredients.pdf FOS act as a prebiotic to increase the growth of beneficial bacteria and hinder the growth of pathogenic bacteria in the animal's digestive tract. Common ingredients in dog food that provide such fibers include beet pulp, cellulose and chicory root.

Arguably the most popular wrestler to compete in Gulf Coast Championship Wrestling, Kelly has been described as \\"John Wayne, Wyatt Earp and Roy Rogers all rolled into one\\" and a \\"hero to thousands upon thousands of Gulf Coast Wrestling Fans\\". He was a record 18-time NWA Mississippi Heavyweight Champion and 11 time NWA Gulf Coast Heavyweight Champion and was inducted into the NWA Hall of Fame, class of 2014. Early life Robert Kelley was born on a farm in rural Kentucky on June 28, 1936. Prior to entering the world of professional wrestling, he was an avid rodeo fan and competitive bronco rider. It was from here that the nickname ‚Äúcowboy‚Äù originated. He served a stint in the U.S. Marine Corps in the early 1950s, where he first got a taste for grappling as part of the wrestling team. Professional wrestling career Kelly married his wife, Chris, in June 1958 and started his journey in pro-wrestling the following year in Louisville, Kentucky. He began by setting up rings and helping the ring crew in a promotion run by Wee Willie Davis and soon was doing ring announcing for the outfit. This led to stints as a referee and eventually as an in-ring competitor, initially with the nickname ‚ÄúIrish‚Äù. Kelly has credited fellow wrestler Matt Gilmore (aka Duncan McTavish) as being his mentor. ‚ÄúHe always liked me‚Äù Kelly said of Gilmore, ‚ÄúHe watched me work‚Ä¶he asked Larry to book me with him in North Bay so he could work with me and show me what to do‚Äù. After a tenure wrestling in North Bay, Canada, Kelly went on to further his wrestling skills while under Lee Fields and Charlie Carr in Mobile, Alabama. He took quickly to the city, later starting that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so thankful I spent my time in Mobile‚Äù. It work here where he also developed a close friendship with promoter Lee Fields, who became his best friend. He work often remark how the two miracles of his life were meeting his wife and making friends with Lee Fields. After Lee's retirement, Kelly travelled and occasionally tagged with his younger brother, Bobby. Kelly stated that ‚Äúhim and I just got along. We went over a million miles together. He was just great to be around‚Äù. Throughout his career, Kelly's home territory was the Gulf Coast region, a territory spanning from Northern Florida into Alabama and Mississippi. He became a top babyface in the territory, so much so that he didn‚Äôt need to travel often, as was the case for the majority of wrestlers in the United States at the time. ‚ÄúIt was a deal where we didn‚Äôt need to go anywhere else. We had a home there and we was booked and we was on top, we made money‚Äù Kelly stated, ‚Äúwe were only out of town once or twice a week‚Äù. Kelly would travel to Eddie Graham‚Äôs Southern Florida territory and had occasionally wrestled in Puerto Rico, but he had no need to wrestle outside the Gulf Coast. Kelly always appreciated the importance of his fanbase. He remarked that he and Fields ‚Äúafter the matches, we‚Äôd never just leave. We stayed around and signed autographs‚Äù. During his career, Kelly had memorable feuds with wrestlers such as the Wrestling Pro, Eddie Sullivan and perhaps his most heated rival, Don Fargo. Kelly later became a booker for the Gulf Coast territory. He worked in this position for many years, coming ‚Äúout of retirement‚Äù occasionally as part of the storylines. He wrestled his final match in 1986, a decade after his full-time wrestling career had ended in 1977. Working alongside Lee Fields, the pair coordinated with Sam Muchnick and NWA to bring various stars from other territories into Mobile, Pensacola, Louisiana and Mississippi. Post wrestling Through his friendship with Lee Fields who owned a motor racetrack, Kelly also became a race car driver. He also owned a wrecked service in Mobile in his post-wrestling years. He was a member of the Cauliflower Alley Club Board of Directors and was President of the annual Gulf Coast Wrestlers Reunion in his later life. Personal life Kelly was good friends with William ‚ÄúBill‚Äù Moody, known as Paul Bearer in WWE. He had said he was ‚Äúdevastated‚Äù after learning of Moody's passing in 2013. Kelly had spent time with Moody on the Saturday before his passing at the annual Gulf Coast Wrestlers Reunion in Mobile. Moody had credited Kelly with getting him interested in the wrestling business Kelly had five children with his wife Chris, who died in October 2013. Bob died on October 12, 2014 with his family by his side after an illness  Championships and accomplishments  *National Wrestling Alliance NWA (Gulf Coast) Louisiana Heavyweight Championship NWA

Scope of the worldwide effort to regulate pesticide contamination in surface soils. Journal of environmental management, 146, pp.420-443 Pesticide standard values are often derived from laboratory toxicology data (i.e., animal tests), human or ecological parameters (i.e., body weight, intake rate, lifetime, etc.), and human health risk models such as USEPA and RIVM models., USEPA-Regional Screening Levels (RSLs) - Equations (June 2017 ), RIVM Committed to health and sustainability On the other hand, the European Union took a precautionary approach (in accordance with the principles of its environmental policy) before toxicological data was available and provided very strict and protective standards for all pesticides in drinking water.Li, Z. and Jennings, A., 2017.

Worldwide regulations of standard values of pesticides for human health risk control: A review. International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 14(7), p.826. Many nations in Africa, Asia, and South America are lacking pesticide standard values for the major human and ecological exposure pathways such as soil, sediment, and water. Pesticide standard values for many current and historical largely used pesticides such as DDT, aldrin, lindane, glyphosate, MCPA, chlorpyrifos, and 2,4-D often vary over seven, eight, or nine orders of magnitude and are log-normally distributed, which indicates that there is little agreement on the regulation of pesticide standard values among worldwide jurisdictions.Li, Z. and Jennings, A., 2017. Worldwide regulations of standard values of pesticides for human health risk control: A review. International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 14(7), p.826. Additionally, many worldwide pesticide standard values are not sufficiently low to protect public health based on human health risk uncertainty bounds calculations and maximum legal contribution estimations.Li, Z. and Jennings, A., 2017.

When a building was renovated in the late 1920s, he realized that the port of Lumbo had a number of design weaknesses, deciding that Nacala should be the port terminal on a line. The tracking was changed and a link between Monapo and Nacala was opened. In 1932, a railroad reached 350 km, already connecting Nacala to Mutivasse and, in 1950, it extended to Cuamba, 538 km from Nacala. Starting from Cuamba, 262 km of lightning were built up to Lichinga.White, Landeg. Bridging the Zambezi: a Colonial Folly. Springer, 18 de junho de 1993. pp. 107-108. On May 17, 1968, the government of Malawi signed an agreement with Portugal to open an extension starting in the city of Nkaya, to connect with Cuamba. The Nkaya station thus formed an interconnection between the Sena Railway and the Nacala Railway. The Nacala line is the longest but most direct route, the Malawi connection to the sea, the way the Sena line to the port of Beira has been predetermined, and most of the freight traffic caused has moved to the Nacala. The Nkaya-Cuamba extension was inaugurated by Malawian President Hastings Kamuzu Banda on July 4, 1970, in a joint ceremony with Portuguese authorities in Cuamba; its operations started on August 3, 1970.Perry, J.W.B..

The purpose serves as a sector \\"development compass\\" that directs or guides the operations of the Ministry, the private sector (fisheries industry players), and putting together agencies in the development of the fisheries sector. The ultimate goal of this Plan is to \\"consolidate the sector gains made' for the period 2010-2013, and to fast track the contribution of the fisheries sector to national development and growth through the implementation of target-specific and growth inducing strategies and interpositions\\". It is also a \\"medium term road map\\" that is directed at guiding Government investment and Development Partner support to revamp the fisheries sector for 2014-2017 and the years ahead.  Goals and policy  The mission of the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development is promotion of accelerated Fisheries Sector Development as a viable economic segment that will conduce to the total development of the economy of Ghana in line with Medium to Long term National Development Policy Frameworks of the country. The main objective of the plan is to enhance operational effectiveness and efficiency of the ministry and its partners towards the achievement of stated sector policy objectives and time- bound targets, output and outcomes of the fisheries sector that are in line with the total medium term evolution goals and policy objectives of the Ghana Shared Growth and Development Agenda. The ideas gained from the goals of the ministry derived its policy base from the thematic focus areas and broad policy objectives and strategies of growth and development agenda that are relevant to its mandate and functions.  Leadership  The ministry consists of several departments and agencies. In total, the ministry is headed by a sector minister, and each agency or department has a director as an official head. In view of this, the Fisheries Commission is the implementing agency of the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development and is headed by the Director of the Fisheries Commission.  Divisions  The commission has five divisions: A. Marine Fisheries Management Division B. Inland Fisheries Management Division C. Fisheries ScientiÔ¨Åc Survey Division D. Monitoring, Control, and Surveillance Division E. Operations and Administration Divisions  Units  The commission has four operational units: A. Fish Health Unit B. Monitoring and Evaluation Unit C. Post-Harvest Unit D. Projects Unit  National Premix Secretariat  The National Premix Committee was constituted by the government of Ghana in July 2009 to oversee the administration and distribution of premix fuel, a hugely subsidised petroleum product in the country. Landing beach committees were established at the various landing beaches to empower the fishermen to operate premix fuel stations at the landing beaches. Each landing beach committee was required to choose an Oil Marketing Company to supply them with premix fuel. Proceeds from the sale of premix fuel at the landing beaches are to be used in developing the fishing communities in the country. A National Premix Secretariat was formed to service the National Premix Committee. The allotment and distribution of premix fuel is undertaken by the secretariat. Requests made weekly for the distribution of premix fuel are sent to the Tema Oil ReÔ¨Ånery, which refines and loads the product into tankers of the assigned oil marketing companies for distribution to the various Landing Beach Committees. = Mandate = The National Premix Committee's responsibility is to supervise the efficient and effective administration and distribution of premix fuel. Since premix fuel is highly subsidized by the government, the National Premix Committee makes sure that monitoring is enforced to avoid diversion or inappropriate distribution. The National Premix Committee is tasked to ensure that the proceeds from the sale of premix fuel are being used to develop the fishing communities in the country. Diverse developmental projects were undertaken by majority of the landing beach committeeCs.

Biography Alejandra Gonz√°lez Soca lives in Montevideo. She graduated from the University of the Republic with a degree in Visual Arts, and holds a Psychology degree from the Catholic University of Uruguay. She attended the workshops of artists Anhelo Hern√°ndez and Carlos Capel√°n. She has participated in projects and individual and collective art exhibitions nationally and abroad. Since 1999 she has held the Casa B studio workshop where she develops her artistic and teaching practice. The work of Alejandra Gonz√°lez Soca has been described as \\"the result of a tension between the unique and unrepeatable ephemeral gesture and the apparent dispersion of the multiplied object, materialized in a polyphonic integration of elements and registers.\\" It is built from the confluence of the fragile and delicate with a certain dirty and germinal air probing a representation of an altered and intimate memory. It uses blurry images, overlapping layers and a formal sensuality where the viewer can have an immersive experience. This is a strategy to show cracks and breaks in the readings on topics such as violence, aggression, and frustration generated by the forms of agreed-upon silencing.

The war took place amidst the wars of expansion and took the life of the brother of Leukon and Gorgippos, Metrodoros. Prelude The Spartocids had been expanding their dominion into the nearby cities of Nymphaeum and Kimmerikon and had set their sights on the Sindike Kingdom. Satyros, in an attempt to gain influence, told the Sindike king, Hekataios, to marry his daughter after he had recently been restored by Satyros. Satyros also demanded that he kill his current wife, Tirgatao, to further assert his control over Hekataios. Not being able to kill his beloved wife, Hekataios sent her to be imprisoned in a tower. However, she was able to escape and evade the capture of Satyros, and returned to her home tribe. Conflict After evading capture, she returned to her land and roused the Ixomatae to war and gained many allies that she used to strike at both Satyros and Hekataios. After seeing himself in a double-front war, he sued for peace and used his son Metrodoros as a hostage. Meanwhile they were at peace, Satyros plotted against her, sending his friends to her court as refugees. His friends then failed in assassinating her, leading to the death of Metrodoros and war once again. Satyros died in a siege and the war was passed unto his sons Leukon and Gorgippos, who sued for peace shortly after their ascension. As the war came to a peace, Tirgatao induced her son by Hekataios, Oktamasades to usurp his father and to make war on the Bosporans. In the following days, Oktamasades took the city of Labrytai, provoking Leukon into declaring war in the name of Hekataios. Leukon, angered at the attack of one of his cities, attacked Oktamasades in the ensuing battle of Labrytai and routed his army completely, forcing Oktamasades to flee into Scythia. Aftermath To honor his victory over the Sindoi, Leukon erected a monument to Apollo. Shortly after his victory, Hekataios may have renounced his power, or died due to age, but as one of his last acts, he may have bequeathed his kingdom to Leukon and Gorgippos, successfully completing their father's original vision and expanding their realm.

The main focus is the transport of coal from mines in western Mozambique east to the port of Nacala via Malawi. The enterprise included both construction of new trackage and the rebuilding of existing lines. In 2010, Brazilian mining company Vale purchased majority ownership in Nacala railway (Mozambique) and Malawian railroad Central East African Railways as the beginning phase of a project to develop rail access from the deepwater port at Nacala to the company's mines near Moatize, Mozambique. In December 2011, Vale contracted with the government of Malawi to rebuild trackage in the country and construct of new railroad from Cambulatsissi on the western border of Malawi to Nkaya, where it would connect with the existing line. In July 2012, Vale entered into a partnership with Mozambican state company Mozambique Ports and Railways (CFM) to improve the existing CDN line--formally named the Nacala Logistics Corridor, the name eventually ended up referring to the entire project in both countries. To this end, mining company Vale, CFM and Malawi companies agreed on the creation of the Northern Development Corridor Society (CLIN) joint venture to manage the logistics equipment in the Nacala Corridor. Early estimates placed the cost of the project, arranged as an 80/20 partnership between Vale and CFM, respectively, at US$1.1 billion. The first test trains began operating over the line in November 2014, and regular service began the following year. In late 2016, the Siemens-designed positive train control system came online, allowing for train frequency to increase with coal production. In May 2017, a ceremony in Nacala marked the formal completion of the line, by which time 22 daily coal trains were operating over the route. By the time of its completion, the total cost of the line had risen to US$4.4 billion. The Nacala Logistics Corridor has a total of of trackage, all of which has a 1,067 mm gauge.

Though curd is usually white, red curd is a distinct type of confectionery. Red curd of the Nadia's Nabadwip type is very popular. Kalipad Modak of Nabadwip was the inventor of the confectionery in 1930. One of the most famous red curd shop is \\"Laxmi Narayan Confectionery Store\\", that is 150-years old curd shop. After preparing the curd, it can be stored up to ten days.  History  There is a legend behind red curd. It is known from Nabadwip's archaeological council that the birthplace of red curd is Nabadwips Phasitala, and the inventor is Kali Ghosh. Kali Ghosh and Hari Ghosh were two brothers, they used to make mostly curd and whey. They used to boil buffalo milk in a gentle fire pouring a small amount of water to make it as condensed milk for a long time. The milk was turned reddish due to long burning. The two brothers used to make wheys from the milk. Their whey making area was known as Red Ghol or Red Whey. When milk becomes thick, it reaches to kheer stage, so sometimes it is called Kheer yogurt. Another name for this curd is Chakku yogurt. There is also a reason behind the name. The quality of the curd is judged on its stickiness. To test it, it is also seen by turning down the pot. Even a Chakku or a knife is inserted inside the pot. Thus the name of Chakku yogurt came from that knife.  Preparation  This curd or yogurt is prepared in two steps, one step is to boil the milk, that is known as foot, and the next step is making it as curd. To prepare the yogurt, pure milk of cow or buffalo is required. There is also a huge contribution of fuel to prepare the red curd. Two types of fuel is needed for preparing the curd. It takes two to six hours to take the first 'foot' of the boiling and it is made by burning wood. The 'foot' will continue until the red color is taken. Nearly three liters of milk is turned into one liter. The next stage of this step is burning in coal. In the case of white yogurt, milk is thickened, at that time, it is needed more time to prepare red curd, i.e. the milk density is thickest for red curd. When the milk is prepared, it is poured in the pots according to the size of the condensed milk, then it is placed around the coal fuel. Then the curd is covered with socks. This step is called yogurt making. And it forms the yogurt. Various types of pot size is supplied according to market demand. The curd contains from 100 grams of clay pots (glass) to five kilograms of yogurt pots. It is the best skill of the makers of Nabadwip that they make this red curd without any outer color.

Donald Trump, et al., No. 1:17-cv-02534 (D.D.C. 2017), was a lawsuit before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiff, Leandra English, alleged that the defendants, Donald Trump and Mick Mulvaney, violated 12 U.S.C. ¬ß 5491(b)(5)(B), a component of the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Act of 2010, when President Trump appointed Mulvaney to be Acting Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). English filed her lawsuit shortly after outgoing director Richard Cordray resigned, and she sought a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to prevent Mulvaney from becoming the Acting Director of the CFPB. In July 2018, English resigned from the CFPB and voluntarily dismissed her lawsuit after Trump nominated Kathleen Kraninger to be the next Director. Chronology On November 25, 2017, English was appointed Deputy Director of the CFPB by outgoing Director Richard Cordray, and according to Cordray that would make English the Acting Director after his resignation. That same evening, President Donald Trump appointed the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Mick Mulvaney, as the Acting Director of the CFPB. On November 28, Judge Timothy J. Kelly denied the plaintiff's request for an emergency temporary restraining order. On December 6, 2017, English responded by filing a request seeking a preliminary injunction to install her as the CFPB's acting chief in place of Mulvaney. Judge Kelly heard arguments on the preliminary injunction on December 22. On January 11th, 2018 Judge Kelly denied the injunction, affirming Mulvaney as Acting Director.https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-cfpb-acting- director-20180110-story.html Two days later, on January 12, English appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.https://www.wsj.com/articles/cfpb-leadership-fight-continues-as- official-appeals-court-case-1515785344 On January 22, a panel of the D.C. Circuit agreed to expedite the appeal.https://www.law360.com/articles/1004885/dc-circ-agrees-to-expedite- appeal-in-cfpb-leadership-fight An oral argument is scheduled for April 12. On January 31, the D.C. appeals court established in another case, PHH v. CFPB, that the law establishing the CFPB can bar the President from firing the CFPB director. In June 2018, President Trump nominated Kathleen Kraninger, an OMB official, to be the next CFPB Director. In response to this nomination, English stepped down from the CFPB and voluntarily dismissed her lawsuit on July 18, 2018. Legal background The case attracted various amicus curiae briefs, including one signed by Barney Frank and Elizabeth Warren, the legal architects of the agency, urging the Court to side with the plaintiff. Another amici brief which supported the defendants was filed by the attorneys general of Texas, Alabama, and Georgia, among others. The general argument against the President's nomination is that the Dodd-Frank Act contains mandatory language that makes the deputy director the acting director in the event of a resignation until the Senate confirms the president's choice of director, in order to make the agency more independent. By this reasoning, it would be mandatory to follow the order of succession or nomination provided by the Dodd-Frank Act for the agency, even if the background law might otherwise allow a different result. The argument for the president's nomination is based on opinions from the Office of Legal Counsel and CFPB's General Counsel that the Federal Vacancies Reform Act provides an option for appointing a successor even when another, more specific, option exists in another statute (in this case, the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Act). The Federal Vacancies Reform Act allows the president to appoint an interim replacement for certain offices without Senate confirmation, but states that it does not provide the ‚Äúexclusive means‚Äù for filling a vacancy when ‚Äúa statutory provision...designates an officer or employee to perform the functions and duties of a specified office temporarily in an acting capacity.‚Äù The law establishing the CFPB (the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Act) doesn't specify whether the director's resignation qualifies as \\"unavailability\\" under FVRA, leading to claims that the general provisions of FVRA should prevail. The Office of Legal Counsel has stated that the FVRA provides a means for naming an acting CFPB Director, but it isn't the exclusive means for doing so, since the act establishing the CFPB has additional provisions. The CFPB's General Counsel issued a memo agreeing with this opinion. A related argument, from the PHH v. CFPB case, is that the President's power over the agency is necessary to ensure its accountability.

She was involved in handling the petition that led to the annulment of the election of Uhuru Kenyatta as president of Kenya, in August 2017. Background and education She was born in Kenya and attended Kenyan schools for her primary school education. She studied at Kenya High School for both her O-Level and A-Level schooling. She was admitted to the University of Nairobi, where she studied law, graduating with a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) degree. Later, the same university awarded her a Master of Laws (LLM) degree, specializing in international conflict management. She also holds a Postgraduate Diploma in Law, awarded by the Kenya School of Law Career Esther Nyaiyaki joined the Judiciary of Kenya in February 2013. Immediately before joining the Judiciary, she worked as a senior editor at the National Council for Law Reporting. Controversy In August 2017, when Raila Odinga challenged the election of Uhuru Kenyatta to the position of president of Kenya, Ms. Nyaiyaki personally supervised the filing of the relevant paperwork, in her capacity as registrar of the Supreme Court. The Justices of the Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice David Maraga tasked Nyaiyaki to conduct an audit of the materials that the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) used to declare the presidential result. She was assisted by a team of ICT experts, appointed by the Judiciary to examine the relevant materials. In its report to the Supreme court, Ms. Nyaiyaki's team established that the presidential election was fraught with massive irregularities, including over 560 non-gazetted polling stations in addition to the 40,883 legally recognized locations. Other irregularities included forms 34As used to declare the presidential winner. Many of these forms were duplicated, some were carbon copies, others appeared to be photocopies, others did not bear the requisite stamps, some did not have serial numbers and still others were not signed, all being contrary to the law. The supreme court took into consideration that report, before they annulled the presidential election on 1 September 2017, in a 4 to 2 decision. Following that annulment, the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission initiated an inquiry into the actions of Esther Nyaiyaki, after one Kenyan citizen filed a complaint. This was followed by a flurry of exchanges between various Kenya government agencies regarding the merits and legality of what had transpired. As of November 2017, Esther Nyaiyaki is still at her position as the registrar to the supreme court, with the backing of the Kenyan Judiciary, which has defended her actions.

His murder remains unsolved. Timeline =Prior to the murder= On July 5, 1996, Surrey, British Columbia resident Blair Adams withdrew most of his money from his bank account and emptied his safe deposit box of cash, jewelry, gold, and platinum. He then attempted to enter the United States via ferry from Victoria, British Columbia, to Seattle, Washington. Immigration officials flagged him as a possible drug courier due to the large amount of cash he had with him. Once he was found to have convictions on drug and assault charges he was denied entry. In the early morning hours of July 9, he was discovered by Canadian border patrol officers attempting to cross the border on foot at the Pacific Highway Border Crossing. Officials noted Adams had scratches covering his legs and hands. Adams matched the description of a man implicated in an automobile theft, and the vehicle had been discovered abandoned near the Pacific Highway Border Crossing; however, Adams denied involvement, and he was freed on lack of evidence. Entrance to United States Adams managed to enter the United States by car on July 10, 1996, via a Nissan Altima he rented from the Vancouver International Airport. He arrived in Seattle, where he then purchased a roundtrip ticket to Frankfurt, Germany at the Seattle‚ÄìTacoma International Airport. Adams had previously worked on a project in Frankfurt for his stepfather's construction company; he had also dated a German woman in Frankfurt, though she later told law enforcement he had never contacted her about visiting. However, Adams subsequently forwent the flight to Frankfurt, and instead traded his credit for a one-way ticket to Washington, D.C.. Upon arriving, he rented a Toyota Camry at Dulles Airport around 6:45 am. Later that morning, on U.S. Route 250 in Troy, Virginia, Adams backed his car into another motorist's vehicle, causing minor damage. The driver of the car told detectives that Adams \\"seemed nice, but was in a hurry.\\" Adams arrived in Knoxville, Tennessee sometime on the evening of July 10, 1996, approximately southwest of Washington, D.C.. The first reported sighting of Adams occurred at a gas station at Strawberry Plains Pike in Knoxville at 5:30 pm. Gerald Sapp, an Interstate Repair Service driver, had been called to the gas station; Adams had told the clerk there that he was having difficulty with his car key, and was unable to enter the car. When Sapp arrived, he realized that the key Adams had attempted to use was for that of a Nissan Altima (the vehicle he had abandoned in Seattle), not the Toyota Camry he was driving. Sapp recalled: \\"I asked him to look in his pockets. I said, ‚ÄòIf you drove this thing up here, you gotta have another key in your pockets.‚Äô And he wouldn‚Äôt look. So I thought he was nuts. He was bound and determined that he had the key he needed for that car.\\" Sapp arranged to have the car towed to a local repair shop, and dropped Adams off at the Fairfield Inn in Knoxville. Upon his arrival at the Fairfield Inn, Adams was captured on closed-circuit television footage in the hotel lobby. Adams spent around 40 minutes loitering at the hotel before purchasing a room with US$100; when the hotel clerk attempted to return his change, Adams exited the lobby and walked outside. It was later determined he never entered the room he purchased. =Discovery of body= Adams was discovered by construction workers around 7:30 a.m. on July 11, 1996, in a parking lot of an under- construction Fairfield Inn location outside Knoxville at the Strawberry Plains Pike-I-40 interchange, \\"half-naked\\" with his pants off and shirt open. His pants, shoes, and socks were lying near his body. Scattered around his body was German, Canadian, and U.S. currency totaling nearly $4,000. In addition to the money found with the body, police also located a black duffel bag which contained maps and travel receipts and a fanny pack which held 5 ounces of gold bars, gold and platinum coins, jewelry, keys and a pair of sunglasses. According to an autopsy report by the University of Tennessee Medical Center, Adams had sustained many cuts and abrasions. The Knox County Sheriff‚Äôs Department has speculated some of the wounds came from fending off an attack. Adams also suffered a violent blow that ruptured his stomach. His official cause of death was ruled sepsis stemming from an abdominal perforation. He also had a wound to his forehead, which police determined was caused by a crowbar or a club. It was also believed Adams had been sexually assaulted, though no DNA evidence was found to confirm this suspicion. Investigation Law enforcement initially suggested the possibility that Adams's death had been \\"sex-related\\" due to the nature of his body when it was discovered, almost entirely nude. The only physical DNA evidence found at the scene was one strand of long hair that was gripped in Adams's hand. According to subsequent interviews with his mother, Adams had been acting oddly in the weeks prior to his leaving Canada, though she said Adams refused to tell her what was bothering him. According to friends and family, Adams had been sober for two years at the time of his death, and had recently stopped attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. He also allegedly told friends that someone was trying to kill him, and confided in his mother that \\"someone had been spreading rumors\\" about him. In a 2010 interview with local law enforcement, it was revealed that the Knoxville Police Department had \\"never received a credible tip\\" in Adams's death, though a composite sketch of a man was released in the case; the sketch was of a man two women claimed to have witnessed Adams speaking to outside a Cracker Barrel restaurant in Knoxville. Media coverage This case was featured on a 1997 episode of the popular television show Unsolved Mysteries.

Park, with translation handled by singer- songwriter Trang Ph√°p. This K-pop-influenced electropop track served as the first official single launching its performer's career as a recording artist. On October 10, 2017, \\"T·ª´ h√¥m nay (Feel Like Ooh)\\" was released via Chi Pu's self-established label GOM Entertainment. However, it quickly drew negative reception from the public, which was mostly aimed at the performer's limited vocal abilities and Trang Ph√°p's lyrical work. Chi Pu's decision to pursue a singing career also created a controversial debate among celebrities, attracting various opinions from artists such as H∆∞∆°ng Tr√†m and Lam Tr∆∞·ªùng. Further criticisms went to the song's accompanying music video for being disjointed in content, and eventually, it became that year's most-disliked V-pop video on YouTube. The track's Korean version, titled \\"Ijebuteo\\", was later included in Chi Pu's debut extended play Love Story (2017). While her live performances were panned for weak vocals, cover versions from Trung Qu√¢n and Tr·ªçng Hi·∫øu received a more-favorable reception. The latter's rendition was also released as a single in January 2018. Background and composition In October 2017, model-actress Chi Pu announced that she was pursuing a career in music, with a web series documenting the process. Two South Korean musicians, Krazy Park and Eddy S. Park, were recruited to join the project after they were introduced to the singer by one of her close friends. They later wrote and produced two songs, \\"T·ª´ h√¥m nay (Feel Like Ooh)\\" and \\"Cho ta g·∫ßn h∆°n (I'm in Love)\\". Chi Pu eventually decided to release the former track first on October 10, declaring it the project's \\"warm-up\\" single. \\"T·ª´ h√¥m nay (Feel Like Ooh)\\" is an electropop track that was influenced by K-pop, EDM and country music. According to the press release, its production was a combination of acoustic guitar and electronic sounds. The lyrics see the performer trying to get over a breakup, and some details can be interpreted as her ambition for future recognition as a singer. Vietnamese musician Trang Ph√°p worked on the song's translated lyrics, although Krazy Park and Eddy S. Park stated that the job would be difficult due to its K-pop-influenced musical styling. They were, however, eventually pleased with Trang Ph√°p's final product. Women's publication, Ph·ª• N·ªØ, noted an excessive use of Auto- Tune on the singer's vocals throughout the track; while various parts of Chi Pu singing \\"oh oh oh oh\\" were jokingly compared by many reviewers to sounds made by a rooster. Due to this comparison, the singer subsequently displayed the animal's imagery or referred to it in several of her music videos and her performance at the V Live Awards in January 2018. Chi Pu is seen reading a newspaper in the video, with one of its headlines saying: \\"'Oh oh oh oh' melodies become youth's new trend.\\" Chi Pu recorded \\"T·ª´ h√¥m nay (Feel Like Ooh)\\" and \\"Cho ta g·∫ßn h∆°n (I'm in Love)\\" in two days in South Korea. The former track's Korean version, titled \\"Ijebuteo\\" (), was included in her extended play, Love Story, which was released exclusively in South Korea. A version with altered Vietnamese lyrics later served for her endorsement for e-commerce website Tiki in December of that year. Reception =Critical reviews= Upon its release, \\"T·ª´ h√¥m nay (Feel Like Ooh)\\" received polarizing‚Äîbut mostly negative‚Äîreactions from reviewers and audiences. Multiple publications regarded the song as \\"disastrous\\", including VnExpress, which also called it \\"bland\\" and \\"unoriginal\\". Zing observed that although the singer was adapting a manufactured pop style, her vocal abilities did not meet the material's expectation. \\"Chi Pu could not do the most important job of a singer: singing\\", wrote a contributor of Ph·ª• N·ªØ who likened her singing voice to an auto-tune \\"machine\\" and criticized the production for sounding \\"a decade old\\". Tu·ªïi Tr·∫ª Online later published a review based on a variety of opinions from the audience. In it, they expressed skepticism of the originality of her future releases and commented on her performance: \\"Chi Pu's vocal is not bad, but it's as flat as a soulless sound created by a computer.\\" \\"Find a place where love leads to / Why should I be sad when it's over? / Where to run to when the rain is coming? / The confusion in my heart troubled me\\" was cited by Ph·ª• N·ªØ and Zing as an example of Trang Ph√°p's \\"nonsense\\" lyrics in the song. \\"Accepting the fact that EDM tracks do not usually require much depth to their lyrical content, [...] the line above is rubbish and meaningless,\\" the former publication continued. Zing also pointed out that having been translated from Korean to Vietnamese had affected the meaning and some of the pronunciations in the song. Th·ªÉ thao & VƒÉn h√≥a agreed; they found Chi Pu's singing \\"acceptable\\" but faulted Trang Ph√°p's \\"clumsy\\" translation for being one of the main factors that failed the song as a whole. In contrast, Ng∆∞·ªùi ƒê∆∞a Tin thought the song was not that \\"disastrous\\", as Chi Pu only needed time to improve. Ti·ªÅn Phong compared the singer to S∆°n T√πng M-TP in 2013, suggesting that despite initial negative reactions from the public, she would eventually succeed. The same comparison was made by another writer from Zing, who felt the public were too quick to judge her and called the singer's decision to follow a music career \\"brave\\". Both Lao ƒê·ªông and Tu·ªïi Tr·∫ª Online went on to say that regardless of some technical errors, some audience still found \\"T·ª´ h√¥m nay (Feel Like Ooh)\\", indeed, \\"catchy\\". Its Korean version, released afterwards, was also panned as many criticized her pronunciation and questioned her decision to enter the K-pop music market. \\"T·ª´ h√¥m nay (Feel Like Ooh)\\" was shortlisted for Best Dance/Electronic Song category at the Zing Music Awards in January 2018, but was not nominated. = Celebrity reaction = Notable performers have since voiced their disapproval of the track and Chi Pu's motive to become a singer, including Thanh Lam, M·ªπ Linh, Thu Minh, T√≥c Ti√™n, Uy√™n Linh, H∆∞∆°ng Tr√†m, Qu·ªëc Thi√™n and VƒÉn Mai H∆∞∆°ng. H∆∞∆°ng personally felt it was an \\"insult\\" toward \\"true artists\\" like herself. The most vocal of the group was H∆∞∆°ng Tr√†m, who repeatedly attacked Chi Pu on social media and claimed the singer was trying to financially \\"exploit\\" fans with her newly started music venture. \\"I initially thought I was wrong [for criticizing Chi Pu],\\" she stated. \\"However, I think people will realize someday that if they were straightforward like me from the start, together they could have stopped something that should not have happened.\\" Chi Pu later responded to the singer's comments during a press conference, saying: \\"If [her comments] were more civilized and less prejudiced, I would have had listened to them.\\" VƒÉn Mai H∆∞∆°ng, who received death threats from Chi Pu's fans following her opinion, explained that she only disagreed with the singer's comment: (literal translation) \\"In Vietnam, if you hold a microphone, you're a singer.\\" This statement first sparked outrage as it was taken out of context and misunderstood as \\"you only have to hold a microphone to become a singer.\\" Chi Pu's full statement actually read: \\"In South Korea, if you hold a microphone and sing, you can become different types of artists like a vocalist or an idol. But in Vietnam, if you hold a microphone, you have to be a vocalist. There's no other term coined for an artist that relied on performing [like me].\\" Minh Qu√¢n also received an immediate backlash for implying that the Agency for Performing Arts should have banned Chi Pu from becoming a singer. Lam Tr∆∞·ªùng directly responded to this by saying that the decision accepting Chi Pu should solely be made by the audience. L√™ Minh Tu·∫•n, Agency for Performing Arts' deputy manager, said that there was \\"not enough basis\\" to suspend the singer and gave similar comments to Lam Tr∆∞·ªùng's. Soon after the incident, Minh Qu√¢n denied that his statement was about Chi Pu. In addition to Lam Tr∆∞·ªùng, other artists such as Thanh H√†, Noo Ph∆∞·ªõc Th·ªãnh, WePro Entertainment's CEO Quang Huy and his wife Ph·∫°m Qu·ª≥nh Anh, Minh H·∫±ng, Ph∆∞∆°ng Vy, Ph·∫°m Ho√†i Nam, Erik, and Chi Pu's former boyfriend C∆∞·ªùng Seven, defended the singer. They joined several media outlets in opposing overly-disparaging remarks that were made by artists such as H∆∞∆°ng Tr√†m, which Thanh H√† called \\"taboo\\" and \\"foolish\\". Noo Ph∆∞·ªõc Th·ªãnh and Minh H·∫±ng expressed sympathy toward Chi Pu as they also had their starts in modelling and acting before gaining fame as recording artists. Music video Among criticisms of the video's inconsistency, this scene where Chi Pu is seen dancing was singled out by critics for being \\"confusing\\" and having poor visual effects The music video for \\"T·ª´ h√¥m nay (Feel Like Ooh)\\" marked the third collaboration of Chi Pu and director Kh∆∞∆°ng V≈©.Kh∆∞∆°ng V≈© had directed the videos for \\"Tada Xmas\\" (2014) and \\"Fighting Fighting\\" (2016). Sources: It was shot in 26 hours, follows a similar concept to music videos of K-pop, and features the singer in six different outfits from fashion houses such as Gucci, Givenchy and Moschino. One billion VND () was spent for clothing in the four music videos, and half of those costumes appeared on this clip. According to Chi Pu, the song's lyrical context served as the basis for the video's narrative, with both depicting a young woman wanting to make a positive change in her life after a failed relationship. The clip shows the singer: performing in front of a house set upon pink-colored clouds and with multiple versions of herself in front of large golden cut-outs; appearing in a fish tank with toys; standing next to a mannequin which has flowers placed on its head; wearing red outfits coordinated with her dancers; and sitting on and dancing in front of a stone throne. In many shots, the singer is backed by various brightly colored and animated graphics, some via a green screen and some via a large LED display. Her stylist, Ho√†ng Ku, was meant to substitute for the mannequin in the video, but the idea was scrapped. Chi Pu later shared that being filmed in a fish tank filled with cold water was the most-difficult scene to shoot, and explained that the last scene, where she sits on a throne, was meant to represent women as \\"the most powerful and the queens of the world.\\" Although many reviewers appreciated the video's production values, most dismissed the final product as a \\"confusing\\" patchwork. Zing noticed the singer's transition to a more-mature image, but thought that the video's message appeared to be \\"vague\\", and further criticized its \\"flashiness\\" and its lack of consistency. Ph·ª• N·ªØ agreed, labelled it as a \\"dated\\" K-pop video with poorly-done visual effects. Both critics and VnExpress other negative opinions targeted the choreography, the \\"out of style\\" fashion and a few particular scenes, including one where the singer improvised her dance moves, her appearance in the fish tank and the usage of LED backgrounds. In December, the clip was reported to be 2017's most-disliked V-pop music video on YouTube with 260,000 dislikes, since its release on October 10. It was later shortlisted for Music Video of the Year category at the Zing Music Awards in January 2018.  Live performances and cover versions  Chi Pu performed the track live for the first time at a press conference conducted for the release of \\"Cho ta g·∫ßn h∆°n (I'm in Love)\\", dubbed as \\"Dream Show ‚Äì Cho ta g·∫ßn h∆°n,\\" on October 27, 2017; and later during her appearance on talk show, B·ªØa tr∆∞a vui v·∫ª, on November 19. Both performances, however, received universally negative reactions wherein Chi Pu's vocals were cited for being weak and often breathless. Trung Qu√¢n later released a jazz rendition of the track on November 12, while Tr·ªçng Hi·∫øu performed a new EDM mix‚Äîproduced by SlimV‚Äîon January 12, 2018, during an episode of the Vietnamese version of Celebrity Battle. The new versions were praised for their arrangements, and the latter was released as a single four days after its televised debut.

The result is heavy on pearly funk and pop, live instrumentation and harmony... Similarly heaped vocal passages, teeming with good ideas, are everywhere on the second half of Jard√≠n.

In The Man from the Train, the Jameses claim to have discovered, through analysis of contemporary records, the existence and identity of a serial killer ‚Äì Paul Mueller ‚Äì who operated throughout North America in the early 20th century, killing between 40 and 100 people. Bill James is best known as a baseball analyst using Sabermetrics, but also writes about crime, having previously published Popular Crime: Reflections on the Celebration of Violence (2012). Summary Bill James's research began with an attempt to solve one famous unsolved crime, the Villisca axe murders, in which a family of six and two house guests were slaughtered in Villisca, Iowa on the night of June 9, 1912. James suspected a possible serial killer based on what seemed like the actions of a practiced criminal at Villisca, found some similar crimes, and brought on his daughter Rachel McCarthy James who found more. McCarthy James was originally hired as a research assistant, but by her own estimate wrote roughly ten percent of the book and thus was credited as a co-author.The Man From the Train - Bill James & Rachel McCarthy James September 21, 2017 lecture at the Kansas City Public Library, Archive.org Via research in newspaper archives the Jameses discovered scores of murders of entire families, committed from 1898 to 1912, occurring in Nova Scotia, Oregon, Kansas, Florida, Arkansas, and other locations, which they ascribe to Mueller.. Though many of these crimes earned significant publicity, they have mostly faded from attention apart from the Villisca murders. Mueller's name was apparently linked to only one crime in contemporary media. He was the subject of an unsuccessful yearlong manhunt as the sole suspect in the 1897 murder of a family in West Brookfield, Massachusetts who had employed him as a farmhand. According to Rachel McCarthy James, she and her father unearthed \\"probably 500 words of material about Mueller, specifically his physical appearance, where he‚Äôs from, his skills and his family.\\"Elon Green (2017) The Father-Daughter Duo Who Found the Truth Behind a String of Century- Old Murders, MelMag.comFor her initial data on Mueller, McCarthy James cites History of the Department of Police Service of Worcester, Mass., from 1674 to 1900, Historical and Biographical (1900) by Herbert M. Sawyer Mueller was believed to most likely have worked as an itinerant lumberjack, as most of the murders occurred in or near logging areas and the killer preferred using an axe. The Jameses point out that in these times, local police usually assumed a local murderer with some connection to the victims. The concept of a nationwide traveling serial killer was never even considered in most cases. Locals arrested after police investigation were usually released on lack of evidence or after the suspects had strong alibis. But a few suspects were convicted and executed or lynched, in the case of several African-American suspects. According to the Jameses, a number of murders in the period which were assumed by local police to be one-off incidents were actually committed by a single person, probably Mueller, based on certain similarities among these crimes. These similarities include being within a few hundred feet of a railroad junction (thus the book's title); the slaughter of entire families in small towns with little or no police force; the families having a barn where the killer was believed to have hidden to observe the families; the families having no dog to warn of an intruder; the killer using the blunt edge of an axe as a murder weapon; the killer leaving the axe in plain sight; the killer covering victims with sheets or blankets prior to the murders (probably to prevent blood spatter); the killer moving or stacking bodies after the murders; the killer covering windows from inside the house with sheets or towels; and the absence of robbery. A killer or killers known as the Axeman of New Orleans was active in 1918 and 1919, but the authors believe these crimes are unconnected to Mueller due to different characteristics at the crime scenes. The killer's motive is believed to have been a sadistic sexual attraction to pre-pubescent girls. While adults were typically ambushed and murdered in bed while sleeping, girls showed defense wounds or other evidence of struggle, and media reports of the crimes often included veiled references to the killer having ejaculated at the crime scenes. Bill James noted that nationwide from 1890 to 1912 there was an average of eight murdered families per year, most of which do not share the characteristics reported in media for the crimes attributed to Mueller. A statistician in his baseball work, James contends that given the rarity of murdered families it is virtually impossible for crimes to have such idiosyncratic features as listed, and yet to not be connected. A lack of such crimes anywhere in the nation for about a year in 1908 led the Jameses to speculate that the killer was apprehended and imprisoned for a minor crime. The Jameses describe themselves as feeling certain that Mueller committed 14 family murders totaling 59 victims, and less certain to varying degrees of his involvement in another 25 family murders totaling an additional 94 victims. The authors also suggest that Mueller may have been responsible for the 1922 Hinterkaifeck murders in Germany. The murders bear some similarities to the US crimes, including the slaughter of an entire family in their isolated home, use of the blunt edge of a farm tool as a weapon (a pick axe), and the apparent absence of robbery as a motive. The authors suspect that Mueller, described as a German immigrant in contemporary media, might have departed the US for his homeland after private investigators and journalists began to notice and publicize patterns in family murders across state lines following the brazen 1911 murder of two families in a single night in Colorado Springs, Colorado and a similar family murder weeks afterward a few hundred miles away in neighboring Kansas.Bill James, Rachel McCarthy James (2017). The Man from the Train: The Solving of a Century-Old Serial Killer Mystery. NY: Scribner Reception In a review for The New York Journal of Books, Bill McClug described The Man from the Train as \\"an interesting and fascinating albeit rather unknown story, and it is commendable that the authors have chosen to bring it to light.\\" But he also criticized the writing style as overly casual and thought it unlikely that the Jameses case could be conclusively proved after a century. Kirkus Reviews gave the book a positive review: \\"Told in workmanlike, journalistic prose with plenty of personal injections‚Äî'hear me out. Have I got a story to tell you'‚Äîthe narrative becomes addictive, and it‚Äôs easy to get caught up in the elaborate search and the authors‚Äô conclusions, which are plausible.\\"  See also  * List of serial killers in the United States References External links *Q&A; interview with Bill James on The Man from the Train, February 4, 2018, C-SPAN 2017 non-fiction books Books by Bill James Non-fiction books about serial killers Non-fiction books about murders in the United States American non-fiction books German serial killers Serial murders in the United States German mass murderers Axe murder German murderers of children ","title":"The Man from the Train"},{"id":"55928214","text":"Allegra Curtis (born July 11, 1966) is an American-born actress and businesswoman who has worked in English and German movies.

British and French support eventually allowed the Qing to retake the city. Fall of Ningbo In December 1861, the Taiping, having already controlled the hinterlands of Zhejiang for many months, began marching on Ningbo under the command of Huang Chengzhong and Fan Youzeng. When the Taiping neared the city, they were approached by British, French, and American diplomats who attempted to dissuade them from taking the city. Although Western diplomats had previously been successful in warning off the Taipings, they were ultimately only able to extract promises that foreign interests would not be harmed. On December 9, 1861, 60,000 Taiping stormed Ningbo. Despite the fact that the British had been training the local Qing forces, there was no military opposition to the Taiping's capture Ningbo. Occupation of Ningbo The capture of Ningbo provided the Taiping with access to the sea and the opportunity to demonstrate that Taiping rule would not harm foreign interests. Initially, foreign reaction to the occupation was positive, even from those who were normally critical of the Taiping, such as Harry Parkes and S. Wells Williams. However, although the Taiping were well- disciplined and took steps conducive to trade, later missives became more negative and the British began to prepare for an eventual retaking of the city by the Qing. Chen Zhengyue, a bagongsheng and member of the wealthiest household in Ying County, developed a plan to retake Ningbo.Xiaowei Zheng, Loyalty, Anxiety, and Opportunism: Local Elite Activism during the Taiping Rebellion in Eastern Zhejiang, 1851‚Äì1864, Late Imperial China, Volume 30, Number 2, December 2009, pp. 39-83, at 39-40 He convinced the Qing troops to attempt to retake Ningbo, collaborated with foreign armies to organize an allied action, and provided funding for the expedition.Xiaowei Zheng, Loyalty, Anxiety, and Opportunism: Local Elite Activism during the Taiping Rebellion in Eastern Zhejiang, 1851‚Äì1864, Late Imperial China, Volume 30, Number 2, December 2009, pp. 39-83, at 40 Retaking Ningbo On May 10, 1862, Zheng Afu, the personal servant of Frederick E. B. Harvey, and Apak, a coastal pirate who commanded a fleet of 150 small, armed boats, successfully incited a British attack by firing upon from the Taiping side of the river. This false flag attack killed two British soldiers and caused Roderick Dew, the commander of the Encounter, and the French to begin a full-scale artillery barrage on the Taiping with six gunships. Peasants and pirates then stormed Ningbo. Zheng was personally responsible for directing the torture and summary execution of captives in the aftermath of the operation. Aftermath After Ningbo was retaken by the Qing, Apak and his pirate fleet began blockading the river and disrupting trade with the city.

His book Industrial Psychology, published in 1932, was the first comprehensive modern textbook in the field. His writings were so influential that he was often regarded as the founder of the field, although he disavowed that claim. Early life and education Viteles was born in Russia in 1898. His parents moved to England when he was an infant, and in 1904, the family moved to the United States. Viteles graduated from high school in Philadelphia at the age of 16. He enrolled at the Philadelphia School of Pedagogy, initially determined to be become a history teacher. However, within a year he had resolved on a career in psychology. Viteles completed his bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees at the University of Pennsylvania in psychology in 1918, 1919, and 1921, respectively. Career In 1921, Viteles' academic career began when he set up the world's first vocational guidance center at the University of Pennsylvania, under the direction of his doctoral adviser Lightner Witmer. In 1922, Viteles was one of the first to use the technique of job analysis, which he used to select employees for a trolley car company. Viteles' 1953 book, Motivation and Morale in Industry, supplemented his seminal 1932 textbook Industrial Psychology by addressing the organizational side of the field. Both works were sometimes known as the \\"Bible\\" of their respective fields. In 1963, Viteles took the position of Dean of the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Education. In 1968, Viteles retired from the deanship, and from the University of Pennsylvania. Following his retirement, Viteles received numerous accolades, including an honorary degree from the University of Pennsylvania. In 1988, Viteles received the Psychological Professional Gold Medal Award from the American Psychological Association. Throughout his career, Viteles took consulting work with large firms, in addition to his teaching and research. He is consequently regarded as an early example of the practitioner‚Äìscholar model. Viteles was also known for the strongly international perspective he brought to the field, building connections with psychologists in numerous European countries.

It is native to eastern North America, where it is widespread. It is found in woodlands, savannas, prairies, and other sunny habitats. It is a perennial species that produces flowers in mid-summer. Lespedeza violacea is known to hybridize with a number of other closely related Lespedeza in the wild. Taxonomy Recent taxonomic work has changed the entity the name Lespedeza violacea applies to. Based upon a reexamination of the type specimens, it was determined that Lespedeza violacea is the correct name of what was traditionally known as Lespedeza intermedia. The entity traditionally known as Lespedeza violacea now has the name Lespedeza frutescens. This nomenclature rearrangement has resulted in widespread confusion among botanists, with older references and some modern botanists retaining the traditional usage. Literature referencing L. violacea must be carefully checked to determine what concept of the species the author is using.

The station describes itself as a \\"feminist\\" radio station; its concession is held by Alianza por el Derecho Humano de las Mujeres a Comunicar, A.C. (\\"Alliance for the Human Right of Women to Communicate\\"), a civil association formed by several women's organizations and activists. History In 2016, the Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT) reduced mandatory station spacing on the FM band from 800 kHz to 400 kHz; this, along with the 2014 designation of 106-108 MHz as a reserved band for community and indigenous radio stations and the 2013 recognition of such stations in broadcasting law, opened the door for two new radio stations to be awarded in Mexico City. The concessionaire was formed by two civil associations‚ÄîSalud Integral para la Mujer, A.C. (SIPAM) and Comunicaci√≥n e Informaci√≥n de la Mujer, A.C. (CIMAC)‚Äîas well as Aim√©e Vega Montiel, a researcher at the UNAM Center for Interdisciplinary Studies in the Sciences and Humanities (CEIICH), to pursue one of the new frequencies to be made available, filing an application in May 2016. On August 23, 2017, the IFT's seven commissioners voted unanimously to award a concession to Alianza por el Derecho Humano de las Mujeres a Comunicar for Mexico City's first licensed community radio station. The concession was formally received on November 29, allowing Alianza to begin construction of the station. XHCDMX-FM was initially projected to sign on in early 2018. As a radio station operated by women, its most significant antecedent was XEMX-AM 1380 \\"Radio Femenina\\", which operated with a format of programs oriented toward women between 1952 and 1960, but was owned by men. As a community station, it joins several licensed stations in the Valley of Mexico, all operating in suburbs within the State of Mexico, including XHNEZ-FM and XHARO-FM in Ciudad Nezahualc√≥yotl; XHOEX-FM in Texcoco; and XHCHAL-FM in Chalco.List of social community concessions, Federal Telecommunications Institute, last updated 16 October 2017 On February 27, 2018, Violeta Radio held a presentation at the Memory and Tolerance Museum to present the new station. At the event, an agreement with Radio Educaci√≥n was announced by which XHCDMX's antenna would be mounted on the same tower as Radio Educaci√≥n's FM station.Tweet from Aim√©e Vega Montiel However, Violeta Radio did not construct its facility in 2018 (XHEP-FM itself did not sign on until November). In February 2019, in an interview with El Economista newspaper, new Radio Educaci√≥n director Gabriel Sosa Plata said that while there had been some delays on Violeta Radio's part, the station was expected to hit the air in May, though XHCDMX began testing on March 14.Post from Violeta Radio on Facebook, March 14, 2019 Programming In an interview, Maru Ch√°vez of SIPAM stated that the station is designed as a \\"counterweight to gender stereotypes\\" and will feature a variety of programs, including news, from a gender perspective. Vega Montiel described the objective of Violeta Radio as \\"to produce programs that are useful to women, teens and girls, that discuss human and reproductive rights, labor rights, the right to education\\". Most of XHCDMX's programming at sign-on will be recorded in Radio Educaci√≥n studios.

History and classification When described N. pygmaea was known from twenty males and two queen fossils which were fossilized as inclusions in transparent chunks of Baltic amber almost all of which are now presumed lost. Additional individuals of all castes have since been found in Baltic, Bitterfeld, Rovno, and Scandinavian amber. Baltic amber is approximately forty six million years old, having been deposited during Lutetian stage of the Middle Eocene. There is debate on by what plant family the amber was produced, with macrofossil and microfossil evidence suggesting a Pinus relative, while chemical and spectroscopic evidence suggests Agathis or Sciadopitys. The paleoenvironment of the Eocene Baltic forests where the P. eocenicum lived was that of humid temperate to subtropical islands. The forests were composed of mostly Quercus and Pinus species, while the lower sections of the forests had paratropical plant elements, such as palms. Rovno amber, recovered from deposits in the Rivne region of Ukraine, is slightly younger in age, being dated to the Bartonian to Priabonian of the Late Eocene. Bitterfeld amber is recovered from coal deposits in the Saxony area of Germany and the dating of the deposits is uncertain. Bitterfeld represents a section of the Eocene Paratethys Sea, and the amber that is recovered from the region is thought to be redeposited from older sediments. The fossil record of Bitterfeld and Baltic amber insects is very similar with a number of shared species, and that similarity is noted in the suggestions of a single source for the paleoforest that produced the amber. The amber deposits on the Danish coast, often referred to as Scandinavian amber, is of similar age to the other three European ambers, however a study of the ant fauna published in 2009 indicates Scandinavian amber has a fairly distinct ant assemblage. N. pygmaea queen The species was first described in 1868 by Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr based on twenty males and two queens. He named the species and placed it into the genus Prenolepis as Prenolepis pygmaea. The species was briefly re-examined in 1915 by William Morton Wheeler based on a group of 57 males and 3 queens, including 10 of Mayr's original male syntypes and 1 gyne syntype. Mayr's placement was unchanged until 2009 when the species was moved by Gennady Dlussky and Alexandr Rasnitsyn. Dlussky and Rasnitsyn noted that when the species was described by both Mayr and Wheeler Prenolepis and Paratrechina were considered a single genus, which was later separated by Carlo Emery in 1925, leaving the fossil species in Prenolepis. Based on the character states observed by Dlussky and Rasnitsyn they moved the species to Paratrechina. Fossil species belonging to the Prenolepis genus group were again examined and reviewed in 2010 by John LaPolla and Gennady Dlussky. Based on the mandible, pronotal structure and mesonotal setae they moved the species to Nylanderia, noting the species to be the oldest in the genus. Paleoecology N. pygmaea is known primarily by winged males and females, a situation also seen in sevreral Ponerinae species in Baltic, Bitterfeld, and Scandinavian ambers. Modern Nylanderia and the ponerinae species from Gnamptogenys, Hypoponera, Pachycondyla, Ponera, and Proceratium are all ground dwelling and nesting species, whose workers rarely climb high into trees. Due to this, the workers of the amber forest species would not often come into contact with fresh resin to be entombed. However, in all of the genera, the winged queens and males would climb plants and trees surrounding the nests during the nuptial flight increasing greatly the contact with fresh resin and entrapment. An investigation of Baltic, Bitterfeld, Scandinavian, and Rovno ambers in 2009 showed over 90% of N. pygmaea specimens in Baltic, Scandinavian and Bitterfeld ambers were alates, while still being a very small component of the ant faunas. In Baltic amber N. pygmaea was between 0.51% and 0.71% of all ants, and in Bitterfeld the species was only 1.26%. In contrast Rovno amber showed a larger percentage at 3.03% and Scandinavian had the highest percentage 3.66%, which was suggested to relate possibly to habitat humidity. Description Workers are between long with a shiny brown exoskeleton. There are setae along the rear edge of the head, two pairs of upright setae on the pronotum, another pair on the mesonotum and the gaster has scattered upright setae. The heads are rectangular in outline, being slightly narrower than long, and have a faintly concave to straight rear margin. The first segment of the antennae, the scape, extends past the rear edge of the head. They have a compact mesosoma that has a distinct metanotal sclerite and a gently curved propodeum. Males are a little larger than the workers, with a length between reported by Wheeler in 1915 and between reported by LaPolla in 2010.

It is derived from an Arabic word suhbah meaning accompany. It is one of the fundamental principles of the legal deduction that presumes the continuation of a fact. It is based on probability and can be applied in the absence of other proofs. Istishab, an initiative of ash-Shafii, is the rationalistic principle of extracting a legal solution according to which changes are not considered to occur until clear signs of these changes are apparent. It serves as the basis for many legal rulings such as the presumption of innocence‚Äîthe person is regarded as innocent unless proven guilty. Malik ibn Anas and ash-Shafii regarded it to be a proof until it is contradicted. Several classical jurists differed over this principle with some Hanafi jurists refusing to regard it as an evidence. It is now widely employed by the contemporaries scholars with the exception of Hanbali scholars.  Definition  Ibn al-Qayyim defined it as Al-Qarafi expressed it as the validity of the former state in the following words.  Types  Istishab is divided into several types. The majority of the scholars agree upon three types. = Presumption of the original absence = It is the absence of any Shariah norms on an adult Muslim, until their legitimacy is established. An example is the absence of the mandatory sixth prayer for a Muslim, the resumption of the person's innocence in a crime, etc. Islamic theologians are unanimous regarding the validity of this type. = Basis in everyday life is permissibility = The overwhelming majority of jurists believe that the basis in useful everyday things is permissibility and in harmful things is prohibition. For example, a certain type of food is allowed until a Sharia argument is established, proving its prohibition. = Presumption of existence before evidence is available = If there are Sharia texts with respect to any norm, backed up by the Istishab, then statements about the abolition of this rule will not be accepted until they are backed up by evidence. An example is the continued ownership of property rights. The application to terminate property will not be accepted until evidence is submitted supporting these statements. Another example is the validity of the ablution, which will not invalidated on the mere basis of doubt.

In particular, The Heart focuses on the transplantation of Simon's heart and how it affects those involved in the process, including Simon's parents, the physicians, the nurses, the organ transplant coordinators, the recipient, and the recipient's family, over the course of twenty-four hours. The novel was first published in France as R√©parer les vivants in 2014 by √âditions Verticales,\\"R√©parer les vivants\\" Retrieved December 10, 2017. and was then published in the United States in 2016 by Farrar, Straus, and Giroux as The Heart,(November 10, 2015). \\"Kirkus Review: THE HEART by Maylis de Kerangal\\" Retrieved December 9, 2017. and in the UK as Mend the Living, also in 2016, by MacLehose Press.\\"MEND THE LIVING.\\" Retrieved December 9, 2017. The Heart received critical acclaim from both Francophone and Anglophone reviewers for its lyrical prose, emotional development, and humanism. It has been performed as a theater play in France since 2015. A film adaptation, Heal the Living, was released in 2016.  Plot  Early one Sunday morning near Le Havre, France, 19-year old Simon Limbres and his two friends, Christophe Alba and Johan Rocher, go surfing. While driving back home, the boys get into a car accident, in which Christophe and Johan are only mildly injured while Simon experiences severe bodily trauma and immediately slips into a coma. It is soon determined that Christophe and Johan were wearing seat belts, while Simon was not. At the hospital, Dr. Pierre R√©vol, the head physician of the intensive care unit (ICU) department, discovers that Simon is unresponsive to auditory, visual, and tactile stimulation, and that his brain has suffered irreversible damage. Eventually, Dr. R√©vol declares Simon to be in a state of brain death, in which he can only maintain involuntary cardiac and respiratory functions with the assistance of a ventilator and other machines, and he does not display any cerebral activity. Immediately after this declaration, Dr. R√©vol deems Simon an ideal organ donor due to his young age and excellent health prior to his passing and subsequently notifies Thomas R√©mige, the head of the Coordinating Committee for Organ and Tissue Removal. Meanwhile, Marianne Limbres, Simon's mother, is the first person to be notified of his admission into the ICU. She contacts and locates Simon's father, Sean, from whom she is separated, and they go to the hospital together to see their son. Upon their arrival, Marianne and Sean are notified by Dr. R√©vol that Simon's injuries are irreversible and that he has ultimately passed away. Sean indignantly accuses Dr. R√©vol and the rest of the ICU staff for not doing enough to save Simon, while Marianne, along with her husband, grapples with their son's death and blames herself for failing to protect him from his precarious lifestyle. The couple is then introduced to Thomas, who attempts to convince them to authorize the donation of Simon's organs. Initially, both parents, especially Sean, are hesitant, citing the symbolic significance of Simon's body and their fear of it being destroyed during the transplantation process. Eventually, Marianne realizes that allowing Simon to surf and live his life the way he did was the best thing she and Sean had done for him, and she decides to accept Thomas' request to donate Simon's organs. She then convinces Sean to do the same. Ultimately, Marianne and Sean permit Simon's heart, liver, lungs, and kidneys to be donated, but are unswerving in their prohibition of donating his eyes. Once he gains consent from Marianne and Sean to donate Simon's organs, Thomas contacts the Biomedical Agency, where an evaluation of the organs is performed and recipients are matched to them. Almost immediately, Simon's liver is assigned to a six-year old girl in Strasbourg, his lungs to a seventeen-year old girl in Lyon, and his kidneys to a nine-year old boy in Rouen. His heart takes slightly longer to find a match, but soon one is found: Claire M√©jan, a 51-year old woman suffering from myocarditis who, after three years of her condition gradually worsening, is in dire need of a heart transplant. That night, the heart transplantation is performed successfully by Dr. Emmanuel Harfang, the head cardiac surgeon at Piti√©-Salp√™tri√®re Hospital in Paris. Exactly twenty-four hours after Simon first stepped out for his very last surfing session, Claire finally has a new heart, and Simon's restored body is returned to his family the following morning.  Characters  * Simon Limbres is a 19-year old boy who is declared brain-dead following a car accident after an early-morning surfing session. He is described as a passionate, adventurous, and carefree young man with a deep love for surfing. Because of his relatively young age and good health prior to his death, Simon is selected as an ideal candidate for organ donation. Ultimately, his heart, liver, lungs, and kidneys are donated. * Marianne Limbres is Simon's mother. She is the first family member to be notified of Simon's injuries and admission to the hospital. Like her husband Sean, whom she is currently separated from, Marianne feels immensely guilty for failing to protect her son, but she later realizes that allowing him to live his bold lifestyle was the best thing she had done for him. Marianne later uses this epiphany to persuade Sean to allow Simon's organs to be donated. * Sean Limbres is Simon's father. He is currently separated from Marianne due to the demanding nature of his job and the consequential strain it placed on their marriage. He angrily accuses Dr. Pierre R√©vol and the rest of the ICU staff for not doing enough to save his son, and is initially adamant against donating Simon's organs. Eventually, he is persuaded by Marianne to allow the hospital to carry out the donations. Along with his wife, Sean struggles to accept Simon's death. He also blames himself for introducing his son to surfing, which is what led to the fatal car accident that took his life. * Lou Limbres is Simon's younger sister. She is 7 years old. Her name is whispered in Simon's ear by Thomas right before his operation, as requested by Marianne and Sean. * Juliette is Simon's 18-year old girlfriend. She is resentful of Simon's passion for surfing, which she sees as an intrusion in their relationship. * Christophe Alba and Johan Rocher are Simon's friends, with whom he went surfing on the day of his death. Both boys were also involved in the car accident, but they only suffered minor injuries. * Claire M√©jan is a 51-year old woman and mother diagnosed with myocarditis who has been waiting for a heart transplant for three years. She is selected to received Simon's heart after being placed on the Biomedical Agency's priority list of recipients due to her state of acute deterioration. While Claire is ecstatic about finally receiving a new heart, she is also afraid of the pain and the possibility of death from the operation, and of the loss of her identity. * Thomas R√©mige is a nurse and the head of the Coordinating Committee for Organ and Tissue Removal, an organization that arranges organ donations and transplants within the hospital. Prior to this position, he was a nurse in the intensive care unit. In The Heart, Thomas is assigned the arduous task of convincing Marianne and Sean to authorize the donation of their son's organs. * Dr. Pierre R√©vol is the head physician of the intensive care unit department at the hospital. He oversees Simon's case and declares him officially brain-dead. * Cord√©lia Owl is a new nurse in the intensive care unit who is assigned to Simon. Before being transferred to the ICU, Cord√©lia worked in the operating room. She is scolded by Dr. R√©vol for speaking to Simon as if he were a live patient in front of his parents who, according to Dr. R√©vol, may misinterpret her words as a sign that their son can still be saved when in reality, he cannot. * Dr. Marthe Carrare is one of the founders of the Biomedical Agency, an organization located within the National Center for the Allocation of Transplants that conducts thorough evaluations of transplant organs and allocates them to various hospitals and patients. In The Heart, she is responsible for finding suitable recipients for Simon's heart, liver, kidneys, and lungs. * Dr. Emmanuel Harfang is the head cardiac surgeon at Piti√©-Salp√™tri√®re Hospital who accepts Simon's heart from Dr. Carrare and performs Claire's transplantation. He hails from the so-called \\"Harfang Dynasty,\\" a prominent and wealthy family consisting of generations of physicians. * Virgilio Breva is a cardiac surgery intern at Piti√©-Salp√™tri√®re who assists Dr. Harfang in the heart transplantation. * Alice Harfang is a new cardiac surgery intern at Piti√©-Salp√™tri√®re who joins Virgilio and Dr. Harfang in the transplantation. She is a descendant of the \\"Harfang Dynasty.\\" Rose is Virgilio's unstable and possessive girlfriend who is resentful of him often being away for operations, and with whom Virgilio cannot bring himself to break up with.  Themes  A central theme of The Heart is the acceptance of reality and death. Throughout the novel, Marianne and Sean struggle with the passing of their son Simon, a strong, healthy young man who lived his life fearlessly and immensely. Sean experiences a greater degree of difficulty coping with Simon's death, as demonstrated by his fury at the hospital for their insufficient efforts to save his son and by his initial and staunch refusal to authorize Simon's organs to be donated. Meanwhile, Marianne blames herself for not doing enough to protect Simon from his reckless lifestyle, but she eventually realizes that allowing him to lead his life the way he did was the best thing she and Sean could've done for him. Ultimately, Sean and Marianne allow Simon to be an organ donor, which is a milestone towards their gradual acceptance of his death and moving on. The Heart also focuses on the psychology behind the refusal to donate a deceased loved one's organs, even with the knowledge that someone else's life can possibly be saved. Sean, who is the most resistant to donating Simon's organs, expresses his desire to preserve his son's body and is repulsed by the idea of it being cut up and destroyed during the operation. To the Limbres, Simon's body is not merely a large mass of skin, tissue, muscle, and bone; it is a tangible symbol for his life, for his existence on Earth, and for the impacts he made on the lives of those who loved him most. In essence, Simon's body serves as a memorial in dedication to his life, and ruining it would diminish his memory and legacy. Although Marianne and Sean eventually give their consent for Simon to be an organ donor, they refuse to donate his eyes, thus showcasing the symbolic differences between each organ.  Background and development  Maylis de Kerangal, author of The Heart, in 2016 In 2007, after watching a television report on heart transplantation, Maylis de Kerangal wrote a short piece titled Swimmer's Heart for Compatible Woman's Body for Who is Alive?, a compilation book commemorating the 10th anniversary of the French publisher √âditions Verticales.

Over the next five years, de Kerangal experienced personal grief and revitalized her interest in heart transplantation, which inspired her to write about the heart not just as an essential organ in the human body like she did in Swimmer's Heart for Compatible Woman's Body, but as a source of love, emotion, and humanism. She subsequently began writing The Heart in July 2012. While developing and writing the novel, de Kerangal consulted with an organ transplant coordinating nurse at the Biomedicine Agency in Saint-Denis, France, who educated her on the legal aspects of organ transplantation and the process of obtaining consent from family members of the deceased.\\"Maylis de Kerangal : c'est l'histoire d'un coeur...\\" Retrieved December 10, 2017. She then met with an emergency physician at the agency who introduced her to Cristal, a software that stores medical records, serves as a database of patients awaiting organ donations, matches donors with suitable recipients, and protects their identities. Finally, de Kerangal observed an organ transplant operation led by Dr. Pascal Leprince, the head of cardiothoracic surgery at Piti√©-Salp√™tri√®re Hospital.\\"Pr.

It started in 2005 as a struggle for housing rights in Mumbai, and continues to fight for rights of slum-dwellers and those cheated by the builders in various rehabilitation and redevelopment projects, including slum-dwellers, those affected by the Slum Rehabilitation Act and the unorganised sector workers. It is a part of the National Alliance of People's Movements and is led by Medha Patkar. History A demolition on 2 and 3 April 2013 in the Golibar area, Mumbai, Maharashtra evicting 43 houses and displacing more than 200 people, was the backdrop against which the movement was born. The resident communities demanded in-situ and participatory housing rights. Medha Patkar with more than 500 slum-dwellers sat on an indefinite fast to protest against any further demolition until an inquiry into the matter was completed. Patkar had alleged corruption and \\"atrocities\\" by builders in the city's slum rehabilitation scheme, and called for the halting of six projects by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority, until a proper inquiry was conducted. The inquiry was conducted, that gave only a partial solution, hence communities continued with their struggle. Following the demolition of 75,000 houses of the poor by the Government of Maharashtra in 2005, Medha Patkar and others addressed a public meeting at Azaad Maidan Mumbai advocating mass action, that the communities re-build their houses on the same sites, and continue to assert and attain their right to shelter, water, electricity, sanitation, and livelihood. Jeevan Bachao Aandolan, Mahul Jeevan Bachao Aandolan (save lives movement) is a 150-plus-day ongoing protest by the residents of Mahul, Mumbai with the basic demand that rehabilitation is supposed to encompass the restoration of livelihood, education opportunities and all basic amenities in an environment that is safe and liveable. The successful outcome of protest with the Bombay High Courts judgment in favour of the residents is a landmark victory for citizen housing movements in Mumbai. =Background= In December 2016 and on 13 May 2017, over one thousand slum houses along the Tansa water pipeline in Vidyavhar were demolished. This was done by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in accordance to the 2009 Bombay High Court order to remove slums along the main water pipelines in the city and keep a 10-metre buffer zone around them. Some of the families received alternate Mumbai Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (MMRDA) accommodation in Mahul village nearly 15km away despite the National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy 2007 which mandates the government to provide alternate accommodation to these people within a 3km radius of their old homes. Apart from the location, Mahul is one of the most polluted areas in Mumbai due to the large number of polluting and toxic industries like Hindustan Petroleum, Bharat Petroleum refineries, Sea Lord Containers, Aegis Logistics Ltd, Tata Power and Rashtriya Chemical and Fertilizers, among others. Moreover, there were no municipal hospitals and municipal schools in the area. This caused a spike in the number of illnesses and diseases faced by residents in Mahul post rehabilitation to the colony. The spike in the respiratory, heart and skin diseases and deaths post rehabilitation has been proved by independent experts and the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board's Comprehensive Environment Pollution Index which categorises Mahul as ‚Äúseverely polluted\\". The high level of toluene in the air led to the 2015 interim judgement by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that stated Mahul was ‚Äúunfit for human habitation.\\" As per an RTI query in 2018, there have been 87 deaths in Mahul due to respiratory illnesses. A report by NGO Vishwashanti Lokkalyan in July 2018 found that 60% of the residents faced a health issue because of the polluted environment. Residents receiving documents from Maharashtra Environment Minister =Timeline of events= This was: * March 2018: the protesters moved the Bombay High Court to take action * July 2018: BMC offers a Rs. 29 crore in-situ development plan for residents which is rejected by residents * August 8, 2018: HC interim order to move protesters out of Mahul till a solution is found * October 23, 2018: Residents plan to meet his Sena President Uddhav Thackeray, handover a signed petition to DCP Rajendra Patil * October 28, 2018: Residents start \\"Jeevan Bachao Aandolan\\", goes on for over 150 days. * November 12, 2018: Protesters meet State Housing Minister Prakash Mehta, who assures he will move them to Kurla * November 27, 2018: CM tells Yuva Sena leader Aditya Thackeray shifting residents to Kurla not possible, say protesters * December 16, 2018: Residents march to Azad Maidan * December 2018: Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis appoints panel to relocate Mahul residents post mass protests. * April 4, 2019: Bombay HC directed Govt of Maha to pay monthly rent of Rs. 15000 to Mahul residents and other PAPs along with a deposit of Rs. 45000 as long as the finding of NGT regarding pollution remain intact. Major victory for protestors. * September 2019: Case remains embroiled in court as Government of Maharashtra refuses to act on Bombay HC decision for compensation * March 6, 2020: State Environment Minister distributes first batch of 288 houses with assurance that remaining allotment will happen soon. =Citizen-led movement= Residents who were forced into the unliveable conditions and faced the consequences of the injustice and hazardous conditions came forward to take collective action that resulted in a citizens movement. Bilal Khan the convener of Ghar Bachao Ghar Banao Aandolan coordinated protests and legal processes along with support from Medha Patkar and several social activists. Awas Haq Satyagraha, Mandala Mandala slum demolition The Ghar Bachao Ghar Banaoo (GBGB) movement currently works in those slums of Mumbai which have been demolished in or after 2004. It works with the affected community and inculcates leadership from within the community. In 2015, Ghar Bachao Ghar Banao Andolan launched the Awaas Haq Satyagraha (Struggle for Right to Housing) along with residents of Mandala, supported by dwellers from across the city and at least five thousand slum- dwellers continue to be on satyagraha in Mandala, Mankhurd, Mumbai. The demands included that the Rajiv Awas Yojana proposal be approved and 3,000 families be allowed to stay put till then, all basic amenities be provided to all slum communities as per section 5(A) of Slum Act, especially water and toilets and that there should be no eviction before monsoon, and never without an alternative. GBGBA has raised a constant demand that SRA projects wherein corruption has been exposed, needs to be reviewed with priority and justice should be done to people through due process with transparency and people's participation. Community activities GBGB believes in building the community and empowering people in informal settlements. Activists and experts from within and outside the community conduct various activities to further this initiative =Children Learning Centre= The Children learning centre is an initiative taken forward by GBGBA for the benefit of the children from the lower stratum of the society. As the name suggests it is a centre for providing basic education to the children residing in slums so that they are well prepared for the formal education process. The presently active centre is in Shivaji Nagar in Chembur West coordinated by Mr. Gulab Ansari, who is a resident of the respective slum. Also, known as Balwadi, the centre provides education free of cost and has a nominal monthly expense of only Rs 12000. Recently four children from this centre have been successfully admitted in a school authorized by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation. Legal and child rights activists have also conducted constitution classes for children in the informal settlements. Budgetary allocations for rehabilitation In 2017‚Äì2018, GBGB raised the issue of budget cuts for housing projects in the Maharashtra state budget.  Ideology and Demands The movement believes that the right to housing is a basic human right and the Government cannot deny it just on the basis of 'illegality'. It advocates the Constitution of India, fundamental rights and directive principles of state policy‚Äîwhich includes the constitutional guarantee of shelter and other basic services, and right to livelihood. It believes in the framework of equity and justice which is required to be the basis for development planning as a whole and housing projects in particular. It fights corruption, malpractices, and protests against the accumulation of resources like land in the hands of a few, and advocates for better implementation of laws related to slum rehabilitation. It believes that poor localities in urban areas need to be seen not as illegal encroachments but as service guilds, that slum-dwellers make vital contributions to the life of the city and thus advocates that they be involved in an equitable and inclusive urban planning and development process.

A particular specific application of the method is in political science. It can be applied to predicting which of the alternative combinations of optional service benefits provided by a local authority,S. Holtby S., A better way for Gosnells, Australian Local Government FOCUS, July 2000 state or national government in their annual budget would meet with the ‚Äòmaximum‚Äô approval of a target population.  Survey design  SIMALTO is based on creating a matrix of the options that can combine to form the product or service. Each row of the matrix represents an attribute and the matrix columns are the various options (alternative features, levels of service, benefits) of that particular row attribute. Each option is associated with ‚Äòcost points‚Äô which indicates how much more or less that option costs to deliver than the other options on the matrix. The cost points may reflect the actual price in currency, say, of a consumer or industrial product option, or, more commonly in service applications, the relative costs to the supplier of delivering the different benefit options. Simalto Matrix Example Example SIMALTO Matrix : To improve from 8 hours service response time to 2 hours would ‚Äòcost‚Äô an extra 10 points. This would be twice the cost of improving from 6‚Äì10 days wait for spare parts to a 3-5 day wait. Respondents complete a series of tasks on this matrix. These may include indicating the option on each row he currently perceives he experiences in the product or service he has now and/or his perception of a rival product or service performance. But the main tasks completed on the matrix are the respondents prioritisation of the options within total ‚Äòconstrained‚Äô budgets. The respondent is given a total amount of ‚Äòcost points‚Äô which he allocates to the options on the matrix to ‚Äòdesign‚Äô his preferred total specification within that total given cost constraint ‚Äì called his first priorities. Then he is given more cost points to ‚Äòimprove‚Äô his first budget allocation to show his second priorities. Typically there are a minimum of three prioritisation stages and rarely more than five. These priorities can be used to create market models that estimate potential market share of alternative product or service specifications. This staged prioritization of options was first developed by John Green while he was the international market research manager at Xerox in London in the mid 1970s. A simpler questionnaire, where the respondent only allocated a single total budget across many of the various matrix options available, to build his ‚Äòpersonal specification‚Äô, was used by Ford in Detroit in the late 1940s. More recently this single stage budget allocation approach has been used by many manufacturers on their web-sites to collect a given respondents preferred specification having been shown the costs of different options. Also this single budget allocation, without the multiple prioritisation stages, is a part of some variants of modern conjoint trade-off analysis. The algorithms required for the modelling predictions of SIMALTO data enabling potential market share calculations and needs-based analysis were first created in the early 1980s, with major improvements and extended capabilities introduced in 2000. If applicable brand can be regarded as a product attribute, but for SIMALTO market simulations, brand value information is not collected in the same way as the trade-off options of the product or service specification. Rather a variant of Brand-Price Trade-Off is used. Total specification price or cost is not treated as one of many specification variables, as in conjoint studies, but treated mainly as a constraint. SIMALTO Modelling is part of the set of trade-off analysis tools used for systematic quantified analysis of decisions. These tools include the various forms of conjoint trade-off, discrete choice modelling and brand-price trade off approaches.  Survey administration  The visual presentation of the matrix of attributes and their options is the key component of SIMALTO studies. Originally these were presented on paper, often in A3 size in Europe or ‚ÄòLegal‚Äô size in the USA. The larger than usual paper size was required to comfortably show all options simultaneously to the respondent. The simultaneous element ensures trade-off priorities are collected in the context of the total specification and each options cost portion of the constrained total cost is always ‚Äòin view‚Äô. Respondents used different coloured pens to indicate their different stages of priorities. The questionnaire can be presented by an interviewer face-to-face with the respondent, or in a ‚Äòfocus-group‚Äô situation where all participants individually completed the various SIMALTO stages under the guidance of a single moderator. The limit on the number of attributes is not constrained by mathematical issues, but rather dictated by common sense of what a respondent can sensibly deal with in a particular product field and in a reasonable time period. Up to 20/25 attributes, each with up to 4 or 5 options is possible. However, in studies that have fairly simple options with short descriptions of alternatives, e.g. banking charge cards or contract options for telecoms services, up to 35 attributes can be included. Studies including attributes where differences between options require more detailed explanations, perhaps with illustrations, mean that 15-20 attributes might be a practical limit. Since 2000 the majority of SIMALTO studies have been completed via the web. This reduces data collection costs considerably but has the disadvantage that the whole of a matrix with 10 or more attributes cannot be viewed simultaneously without scrolling the matrix on the screen. This disadvantage means that 20 is a realistic maximum attribute number on the web, unless respondents are sufficiently motivated (by product interest and/or incentives) to spend longer than 20 minutes completing the questionnaire.  SIMALTO analysis  With SIMALTO approach the data collected is directly useful in itself. The sequential process of building up a specification reflects real life evaluation of products or services. It mirrors respondent decisions such as ‚Äòwhat options must I have, what options are nice to have, what are they worth to me and which options are unnecessary for me‚Äô. Simply counting how many respondents choose a particular option in preference to another provides an unambiguous quantification of each option's relative popularity. However this direct data is insufficient to deduce the most popular total specification when there are more than 5 or 6 attributes, or to predict preference shares between competing specifications at different prices/costs. Therefore, to satisfy these requirements modelling capabilities must be applied to the raw SIMALTO data. The method most frequently used is based on expert system rules linked to neural net logic and genetic algorithm theory. Examples of these rules applied to competing specifications facing an individual respondent: * For similarly priced specifications, the one that contains more of the respondents high value priority options and fewer of his low value priority options is likely to be the one most preferred. * The specification that has the fewest options he considered to be ‚Äòunacceptable‚Äô (if asked on the questionnaire) will be preferred to those with more unacceptable options. * The specification that is priced (costed) nearest the price he wanted to pay for this product is likely to be preferred to those that are either over-specified, and therefore likely to be too expensive, or those that are under-specified and therefore unlikely to satisfy his needs. * The SIMALTO modeling analysis expects that the respondent will seek the best ‚Äòbargain‚Äô. That is the difference between the value of the specification to him compared to the price it is sold at. Application of rules such as these enables predictions of potential market shares between competing specifications, determination of those options in an ‚Äòoptimum‚Äô specification at a given total specification price/cost, a hierarchy of preference for each option relative to other options and for ‚Äòneeds-based‚Äô cluster analysis which can find groups of respondents with similar values/priorities.  Advantages and disadvantages  = Advantages = * The questionnaire sequence engages the respondent and ‚Äòeducates‚Äô him if required about competing options/benefits availability and their likely relative prices/costs. The respondent is not completing a ‚Äòtick-box‚Äô survey simply asking for ‚Äòtop-of-the-mind‚Äô response. * Because the respondent evaluates each option on many occasions and the modeling uses these several data inputs, the variance of reported findings is less than usual with individual observations. * The SIMALTO modelling analysis is ‚Äòcause and effect‚Äô based and does not rely on equations that might make statistical demands on data distribution and attribute independence assumed by, but may not be realised by, regression based trade-off questionnaire approaches. Simulation preference predictions are made for each respondent individually ‚Äì there is no averaging of forecasts across respondents required by methods that can only show a subset of all the options to an individual respondent when there are more than 7 or 8 attributes. * Needs-based cluster analysis is carried out directly on individual respondents and does not require complex statistical Bayesian analyses. * Product price or service cost is not treated as a trade-off variable but rather price and cost are more considered to be a constraint, better reflecting the real-life situation. * Brand value, if included in a survey, is not simply treated as another trade- off attribute. In many product fields most major manufacturers can produce most of the options on the SIMALTO matrix, so to trade off a brand with one or more options is not realistic. But brand does have a relative value (due to brand image factors, promotion, availability, customer inertia etc.) and so brand value is included in the forecasting process directly on its own terms. * Research findings can be directly linked to raw data. The direct un-modelled SIMATO data can be used to explain why the simulation forecast was as provided. = Disadvantages = * Between 5% and 10% respondents find the initial appearance of many attributes and options rather daunting which can deter them from completing the survey. A one-on-one interviewer/respondent situation may help resolve this, but for web based surveys a helpful interviewer is usually unavailable. * For a product or service with many features, designing the Simalto matrix can be time-consuming. * With too many options, in a web-based survey some respondents may not read all the possible options as they will have to scroll down. * Respondents may feel forced to think about issues they would otherwise not pay attention to.

It has one or two leaves and a flowering stem with up to six pale lilac-coloured to mauve flowers with darker markings. Description Diuris dendrobioides is a tuberous, perennial herb with one or two linear leaves long, wide and folded in half lengthwise. Between two and six pale lilac-coloured to mauve flowers with darker markings and wide are borne on a flowering stem high. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped, long, wide angled upwards with curled edges. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, long, wide, and turn downwards. The petals are erect, ear-like above the flower, long and wide on a greenish purple, stalk-like \\"claw\\" long which gradually merges with the egg-shaped \\"ear\\". The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is fan-shaped to almost circular, wide with a ridge along its mid-line. The lateral lobes are linear egg-shaped with the narrower end toward the base, long and wide. There are two broad ridge-like calli long either side of the central labellum ridge. Flowering occurs from September to January.Walcha Taxonomy and naming Diuris dendrobioides was first formally described in 1882 by Robert FitzGerald from a specimen collected near Murrumburrah and the description was published in his book Australian Orchids. The specific epithet (dendrobioides) refers to a resemblance of this orchid to a species of Dendrobium. The Latin ending -oides means \\"resembling\\" or \\"having the form of\\". This species is listed in the Index Kewensis as a synonym of Diuris punctata var. punctata. Distribution and habitat The wedge diuris grows amongst grasses in forest. It is widespread in the eastern half of New South Wales but is rare in Victoria, occurring only near Wodonga. Conservation Diuris dendrobioides is listed as \\"Endangered\\" in the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988.

The local daimy≈ç Ch≈çsokabe Motochika seized the cargo of the richly laden Manila galleon, and the incident escalated to Toyotomi Hideyoshi, ruling taik≈ç of Japan. The pilot of the ship incautiously suggested to Japanese authorities that it was Spanish modus operandi to have missionaries infiltrate a country before an eventual military conquest, as had been done in the Americas and the Philippines. This led to the crucifixion of 26 Christians in Nagasaki, the first lethal persecution of Christians by the state in Japan. The executed were later known as the Twenty-Six Martyrs of Japan. Background Soon after the first contacts in 1543, Portuguese ships started to arrive in Japan to trade. At the time, the Japanese were very much looking forward to acquiring Chinese goods such as silk and porcelain, but had been prohibited from private trade with China by the Ming dynasty as a punishment for the wokou pirate raids. The Portuguese therefore found the opportunity to act as intermediaries trading Chinese goods for Japanese silver and profited immensely. The Nanban trade, as this Euro-Japanese trade activity came to be called, was closely tied to the propagation of Christianity. Portuguese-sponsored Jesuits took the lead in proselytizing in Japan, and the fait accompli was approved in Pope Gregory XIII's papal bull of 1575, which decided that Japan belonged to the Portuguese Diocese of Macau. Hence the Jesuits enjoyed the exclusive right to propagate Christianity in Japan, which meant their sponsors, the Portuguese, had the exclusive right to trade with Japan within Christendom. The Christian mission in Japan enjoyed early success among the warring daimyo of the Sengoku period, because Portuguese traders, under the influence of the missionaries, were more willing to stop at ports belonging to a Christian lord, which for the daimyo meant better access to European firearms. This situation gradually changed as Toyotomi Hideyoshi came close to unifying Japan and became concerned about potential decentralizing factors, such as vassals following a foreign religion. In 1587, after a cordial audience with Gaspar Coelho, Superior of the Jesuit mission, Hideyoshi became more concerned as Coelho boasted that the Jesuits could summon Portuguese warships and rally Christian daimyo for Hideyoshi's upcoming invasion of Korea. No more than two weeks later on July 24, Hideyoshi ordered the expulsion of the Jesuit missionaries from Japan. However, the 1587 decree was not particularly enforced. Even Hideyoshi himself knowingly flouted the edict and allowed Jesuit missionaries into Japan as translators and trade intermediaries. Eventually the missionaries felt safe enough to continue their proselytising in Japan, albeit discreetly. Despite the union of the Spanish and Portuguese crown in 1580 stipulating that Spain would not interfere with Portugal's colonial empire, Spanish-sponsored missionaries of the Franciscan Order viewed Portugal's success in Japan with jealousy and sought to disrupt the Jesuit monopoly in Japan. The friars entered Japan through the Philippines in 1593, and an initial audience with Hideyoshi was deemed encouraging enough that they began to proselytize openly near the capital Kyoto. The Jesuit fathers immediately complained of the friars' illegality and cautioned against their reckless disregard of the 1587 edict, but the Franciscans, convinced of the soundness of their methods due to their successes in the Americas, paid these warnings no heed. Wreck of San Felipe On July 12, 1596, the Spanish ship San Felipe set sail from Manila to Acapulco under captain Mat√≠as de Landecho with a cargo that was estimated to be worth over 1 million pesos. This relatively late departure of the Manila galleon meant San Felipe sailed during the Pacific typhoon season. After being hit by two typhoons, the captain decided to sail towards Japan to refit, but on the approach to the Japanese coast the galleon was hit by a third typhoon, leaving the ship without any sails. Thanks to the Kuroshio current, the ship was able to drift towards Japan, a happenstance that the crew considered a miracle. Despite sighting land on the latitude of Kyoto, the ship could not land in the strong winds and was drifted away. Amid fears of the uncontrollable ship crashing into the rocks, San Felipe approached the coast of Tosa Province on Shikoku on October 19, 1596. Assured by the tales of Hideyoshi's hospitality to the friars, the captain felt safe enough to turn down a suggestion from his crew to make their way to the friendly port of Nagasaki, center of the Nanban trade. The local daimyo Ch≈çsokabe Motochika, however, showed himself to be unfriendly to the foreigners as he forced the disabled ship to go to his home port of Urado (Êµ¶Êà∏; in present-day K≈çchi) with 200 armed boats. Once San Felipe reached Urado, it was wrecked on a sandbar. The Ch≈çsokabe samurai then confiscated the remaining 600,000 pesos worth of cargo onboard the rest had already been lost in the stormy voyage. Ch≈çsokabe Motochika claimed it was standard procedure, as it was his understanding of the Japanese maritime law that any vessel stranded or wrecked in Japan belonged to the local authorities along with its cargo; he may also have been tempted by the cargo itself, since the Nanban trade and the wealth associated with it rarely reached Shikoku. When the Spanish crew protested, Motochika suggested that they take their case to Hideyoshi, the de facto head of government, and recommended they seek help from his personal friend Mashita Nagamori, one of the five commissioners under Hideyoshi. Captain Landecho acted upon the advice and sent two of his officers to the capital Kyoto, with the instructions that they should rendezvous with the Franciscan friars and avoid dealing with the Jesuits. Interview and reaction Ch≈çsokabe Motochika's recommendation proved to be of dubious faith, as Mashita Nagamori saw profit to be made from the situation, and advised Hideyoshi to keep the cargo for the court treasury. The Jesuits caught wind of the matter and offered to intercede on behalf of the Spanish crew, suggesting the services of another of the five commissioners, the Christian sympathiser Maeda Gen'i; but the Franciscan commissary in Kyoto, Pedro Bautista, refused. By the time Maeda Gen'i was contacted, Mashita Nagamori was already on his way and Maeda could do no more than to write a letter to his colleague urging leniency. When Nagamori reached Tosa, he asked for a monetary bribe from the Spaniards; failing that, he set about loading San Felipe's freight onto a hundred Japanese boats to ship to Kyoto. While this was going on, Nagamori acquainted himself with the Spaniards, who entertained him with music and games and a show of fencing. He then asked Pilot Major Francisco de Olandia where they came from and how they came to Japan. At this point Olandia produced a map showing the extent of the Spanish colonial empire, and insinuated that Spain gained its empire by first converting native populations to Christianity with missionaries and then sending in conquistadors to join the newly converted in an invasion of conquest. Nagamori then inquired about the relationship between Spain and Portugal, and was indignant when the pilot and the ensign of the ship both replied that the two empires shared one king (the Jesuits had long explained to the Japanese that the two countries were different and separate). This exchange was duly reported to Hideyoshi, who reacted with fury. The pilot's revelation was a confirmation of Hideyoshi's suspicions of Christian \\"fifth columnists\\" in Japan, which had been fanned by his anti-Christian retainers. He responded quickly, ordering all the missionaries in Japan to be rounded up. Ishida Mitsunari, first among the five commissioners under Hideyoshi, clarified that Hideyoshi's order was directed towards the Franciscans that openly violated his 1587 edict the Jesuits, who were discreet in their preaching, were excluded. In the end, twenty-six Catholics six Franciscan friars, seventeen Japanese Franciscan tertiaries, and three Japanese Jesuits included by mistake were paraded from Kyoto to Nagasaki, where they were crucified on a hill on February 5, 1597. A passenger of San Felipe, the friar Philip of Jesus, was among the martyrs. Aftermath Captain Landecho, who went to Osaka himself in a bid to reclaim San Felipe's cargo, was told there that Hideyoshi had reason to treat him as a pirate to be executed, but instead he would be granted his life and be allowed to leave Japan with the crew and passengers of San Felipe, although the black slaves on board were recruited into Hideyoshi's service. Part of the confiscated cargo was used to finance the Japanese invasion of Korea, and the rest distributed among the Japanese nobility some items even found their way to the Emperor of Japan. The blame for the San Felipe mishap was hotly debated by the rival religious orders. The account of the friars who escaped martyrdom downplayed the statement by the pilot, while accusing the Jesuits of inaction, and worse, treachery. The Spaniards alleged that the Portuguese-sponsored Jesuits were the instigators of the incident as they urged Hideyoshi to seize the cargo, denounced the Spaniards as pirates and conquistadors, and insulted the Spanish king despite the fact that Portugal was part of Spain at the time. The Jesuits formally denied all these claims, instead pinning the blame on the Franciscan friars' recklessness in Japan that destroyed any previous goodwill Hideyoshi had shown: the pilot's slip-of-the-tongue only gave Hideyoshi an opportunity to act on his pre-existing suspicions. These debates and the exaggerated stories surrounding the San Felipe episode were spread across the Spanish colonial empire and resulted in much resentment against Portugal and the Jesuits. Along with the martyrdom of the 26 Christians, the San Felipe incident set off a new round of persecution against the Christians, in which 137 churches were demolished and the Jesuit missionaries were ordered to leave Japan. The Jesuits made a show of compliance by loading a Macau-bound carrack vessel with ordinary Portuguese in missionary wear, then continued to evangelize in Japan discreetly until Hideyoshi's death in 1598.

It stores about 5 million cubic meters of municipal solid waste. Every day it receives more than 250 garbage trucks with a volume of 15 cubic meters. The height of the garbage dump is about 25 meters. Since 2014 the dump has received for about 4 million tons of waste. Aleksinsky Quarry is a threat to people's health. The landfill site ‚ÄúAleksinsky Quarry‚Äù next to Klin, August 2017 Demonstration against stink from the rubbish dump in Klin  History of the rubbish dump  Aleksinsky Quarry is situated within 2 km from the city of Klin, 1 km from a school and less than 500 meters from residents‚Äô houses. At first sand was excavated there but then it became a local garbage dump for Klin. From 1993 to 2013 the dump received about 1.5 million tons of waste. At the order of the Russian President the dump had to be closed and reclaimed along with others in Moscow Oblast in 2013. In February 2014, the Moscow Oblast‚Äôs Ministry of Ecology reported the end of the dump exploitation because of the rated capacity depletion. The same year, violating Russian law, the dump restarted its work, not being in the register of municipal solid waste disposal. Millions of tons of garbage started arriving from Moscow without any following of disposal process control. For the period from 2014 to 2015, a deep sand quarry turned into a huge hill. In 2014 about three million tons of waste was dumped, in other words twice the quantity as for the previous 20 years.  Ecological disaster  Firstly local authorities ignored the problem, then promised to solve it, and finally got down to legalize the dump. The landfill site got emission allowances and was included in the register of municipal solid waste disposal. The residents were refused access to review these documents. According to the Ministry of Ecology of Moscow Oblast, the operating company frequently violated project requirements, leaving waste uncovered without soil layers and not using any waste treatment and landfill gas capturing technologies. All these violations have led to a serious impact on the environment. A leachate has leaked to groundwater; people feel the poisoning stink of landfill gases every day; flocks of seagulls put at risk the functioning of a local aerodrome. The smell affect to visitors of Tchaikovsky State House-Museum. In 2017, The Emergency Situations Ministry detected that the concentration of hydrogen sulphide in the air exceeded a threshold limit value by 25 times in the living area.Measurements result scanning People's health has worsened noticeably, the number of patients suffering from cancer has increased. While planning to double the dump's square, local authorities keep reassuring people that everything is under control and there is nothing to worry about.

He was a Visiting Professor at University of Leicester and a Consultant in Applied Physiology, Royal Air Force Institute of Aviation Medicine. He was a scientist interested in the autonomic control of the cardiovascular system with a special interest in exercise and high-altitude physiology, and was a keen mountain-climber.  Biography  John H. Coote was born in London, the son of a minister in the Pentecostal Church, who had an electrical engineering background. He was evacuated during the second World War to South Wales where his mother's family were miners. After the cessation of hostilities Coote returned to London and attended Enfield Grammar school. He won a place to read Medicine at University College London in 1954, and was called up for national service shortly afterwards. It was likely that he would have been able to defer time away from his studies, but on the advice of his father Coote chose to register as a pacifist and became a conscientious objector. He was sentenced to three years agricultural and hospital work. In 1958 when Coote returned to Medicine, his passion for physiology developed leading to an intercalated BSc in 1962 and a PhD in 1964 under Charles B. B. Downman at the Royal Free Hospital. Although Coote briefly returned to his medical studies in 1964, the draw of research was too strong and he was appointed to a lectureship in 1967 in Birmingham.  Climbing  University brought with it a passion for climbing, the University of London Graduate Mountaineering Club was in its infancy in the 1950s and the young John Coote was an early member. In the late 50s and 60s Coote climbed extensively in Britain and the European Alps, and he used this experience to lead outdoor activities with the Reverend Bob Shepton and the Cambridge University Mission. A thirst for exploration took him on expeditions to Morocco, Kenya, Greenland, and the Andes. The early 1970s saw Coote barely survive an accident near the summit of Pico Bolivar that costs the lives of both his climbing companions but it also brought with it marriage and children. Coote's passion in climbing and mountaineering started to overlap with his physiological interests in the 1980s and he undertook expeditions to Rupina La (Nepal), Karakorum (Pakistan), Cerro de Pasco (Peru) and Everest (Nepal) to study the effects of high altitude on human performance. Science Coote was an autonomic physiology who maintained active hands on research for nearly 60yrs until his sudden death. He was particularly known for: *how exercise increase blood pressure *how the brain influences the heart how the vagus nerve influence in the heart, which is of particular relevance for the therapeutic field of vagal nerve stimulation *how the brain influence kidney function, particularly in the context of hypertension and kidney failure *early work on the how changes in breathing could affect the function of the heart and the rest of the cardiovascular system. *the benefits of acetazolamide prophylaxis to reduce the incidence of altitude sickness, as part of the Birmingham Medical Research Expeditionary Society. =Editorial work= Coote was chairman of the Editorial Board of Experimental Physiology from 2000 to 2006, and a Guest editor for Autonomic Neuroscience: Basic and Clinical. =Awards= * Paton Prize of the Physiological Society (2005) * Carl Ludwig Distinguished Lectureship of the American Physiological Society (2003)  Timeline  Substantive posts include: * Lecturer in Department of Physiology, University of Birmingham (1967), Senior Lecturer (1970), Reader (1977) * Professor of Physiology, Bowman Professor and Head of Department of Physiology, University of Birmingham (1983-2003) * Head of School of Basic Medical sciences, University of Birmingham 1988-91 * Emeritus Professor 2003-17 * Visiting Professor Tokyo 1974, Chicago 1988, Shanghai 1989, Heidelberg 1992, Nankai 2004 * Visiting Professor in cardiology, Glenfield Hospital, University of Leicester (2003‚Äì17), in biomedical sciences at University of Warwick (2003-?) * Honorary consultant in physiology NHS Dudley 1978-82 * Chairman of the Ethics Committee for DERA and QinetiQ 1998-2008 * Council of the British Heart Foundation 1998-2003 * Defence Science Advisory Council 2003-? * Consultant in Applied Physiology RAF * Fellow of Royal Society of Biology (1988), Fellow of Royal Geographical Society (2004), Honorary Fellow of British Pharmacological Society (2012) Publications High-impact publications (more than 100 citations) include:  * References External links *Experimental Physiology commemorative virtual issue *The Journal of Physiology commemorative virtual issue British physiologists Academics of the University of Birmingham Fellows of the Royal Geographical Society Fellows of the Royal Society of Biology ","title":"John H.

Hotton began her political career with Ricardo L√≥pez Murphy's party, Recreate for Growth, which merged with Republican Proposal. In March 2009, she launched the Valores para mi pa√≠s party, formally breaking from the Republican Proposal in August of that same year. Hotton promoted the conservative party as being the emphatic opposition to the legalization of abortion. In May 2010, she was one of the primary opponents to Same-sex marriage in Argentina in the Chamber of Deputies, leading demonstrations against the passing of same-sex marriage in July. During the devising of the 2011 budget for the Government of Argentina, Hotton denounced an alleged attempt at bribery through text messages.

He served as both a parish priest and as the director for the \\"Il Messaggero di Sant'Antonio\\" magazine in Padua before and during World War II. It was in that conflict that he set up an elaborate network designed to protect Jewish people as well as British prisoners of war and Yugoslavs. But the Nazis soon discovered his plans and organized his arrest in October 1944 before killing him some weeks later after brutal tortures in their interrogations. The process for his beatification opened in 2002 and he became titled as a Servant of God. He has also been referred to as the \\"Italian Father Kolbe\\" in reference to the saint. Life Nicol√≤ Cortese was born on 7 March 1907 in Cres (town) (a town on the island with the same name) to Matteo Cortese and Antonia Battaia; he was baptized in the local parish sometime that month as Nicol√≤ Matteo. There were four children born in total including Cortese. He attended school in Cres until 1918 when the school closed as a result of World War I. In 1920 he entered the Order of Friars Minor Conventual and then underwent his period of novitiate in Padua at the convent in Camposampiero from October 1923 to 1924 where he assumed the religious habit. He made his solemn profession into the order on 10 October 1924. Cortese then underwent his philosophical studies at Cres from 1925 to 1927 and then in Rome for theological studies at the Saint Bonaventure pontifical college from 1927 to 1931. He was ordained to the priesthood in the Basilica of Saint John Lateran on 6 July 1930. Cortese celebrated his first Mass at the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. His first assignment after his ordination was at the Basilica di Sant'Antonio in Padua and he lived at the Immaculate Conception church at this time because the convent was still undergoing construction. This pastoral assignment lasted from 1931 to 1933 until that December when he was sent to the Viala Corscia parish in Milan for further pastoral work; this lasted until 1937. In January 1937 he was appointed as the director of the noted magazine \\"Il Messaggero di Sant'Antonio\\" and served in that role until July 1943. He was responsible in his tenure for the magazine having received 500, 000 new members worldwide. The renowned Carlo Bolzonella helped him in editing and publishing several books. Cortese was keen on writing and taking photos and he often contributed to several magazine articles. He slept little and preferred to write whenever he could; he was small and thin and Bolzonella said that \\"Father Placido was an angel\\" who was \\"all heart\\". Cortese organized several rescue missions during World War II for Jewish people as well as for British prisoners of war and Yugoslavs (prisoners in Italy). He began to do this on the personal request of Cardinal Francesco Borgongini Duca. But Cortese was bold and continued his work despite knowing that it would bring him into the path of the S.S.; he was later arrested on 13 October 1944. The Nazis viewed Cortese as an ideological and practical militant of the Resistance who proved a great threat to them. He led this secret network from his confessional in the basilica where people would come pretending to go to confession but used coded language in order to communicate their real requests. One example being \\"I need five eggs\\": this meant that five people needed identification papers in order to get into Switzerland. Another example was \\"We need three kilos of flour\\" meaning that three people needed refuge in Padua. Members of the Resistance (spies for the Nazis and Fascists) spied on him and decided to bring Cortese to the Gestapo. Those spies greeted Cortese outside the basilica in the afternoon at 1:55pm and offered him a ride in their car. Those spies took him to the Gestapo bunker in Piazza Oberdan Trieste where he was subjected to brutal tortures and interrogations with the Nazis pulling out his eyes and cutting his tongue off. Cortese was buried alive and died sometime in November; sources suggest his death occurred on 3 November though others pinpoint 15 November. His ashes were mixed with those of other victims after his remains were cremated at the Risiera di San Saba in Trieste. In 1951 the Padua council named a street in his honor. In October 2004 a bust in his honor was unveiled at the basilica. His bronze monument stands near the Franciscan monastery on Cres. Beatification process The beatification process opened under Pope John Paul II on 8 October 2001 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections) edict and titled the late priest as a Servant of God. The diocesan process was opened in Trieste to determine if Cortese had been killed \\"in odium fidei\\" (in hatred of the faith) and this process lasted from 29 January 2002 until 15 November 2003. Documents from that process was submitted to the C.C.S. in Rome who validated the process on 4 June 2010. But it was at this stage that there were doubts about whether the \\"in odium fidei\\" concept could be applied to this cause. The postulation was advised to launch another diocesan investigation to assess his virtues as opposed to the manner of his death just in case the initial case was denied and thus would result in another cause being opened. The next diocesan phase lasted from 30 July 2012 until 25 October 2012 with the C.C.S. validating the process on 17 May 2013. The postulation later submitted the Positio dossier to the C.C.S. and historians approved the virtues cause in January 2017. The current postulator for this cause is the Conventual Franciscan friar Damian-Gheorghe PƒÉtra≈ücu.

The CMB distribution can be used to model both positive and negative association among the Bernoulli summands,. The distribution was introduced by Shumeli et al. (2005),Shmueli G., Minka T., Kadane J.B., Borle S., and Boatwright, P.B. \\"A useful distribution for fitting discrete data: revival of the Conway‚ÄìMaxwell‚ÄìPoisson distribution.\\" Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series C (Applied Statistics) 54.1 (2005): 127‚Äì142. and the name Conway‚ÄìMaxwell‚Äìbinomial distribution was introduced independently by Kadane (2016) Kadane, J.B. \\" Sums of Possibly Associated Bernoulli Variables: The Conway‚ÄìMaxwell‚ÄìBinomial Distribution.\\" Bayesian Analysis 11 (2016): 403‚Äì420. and Daly and Gaunt (2016).Daly, F. and Gaunt, R.E. \\" The Conway‚ÄìMaxwell‚ÄìPoisson distribution: distributional theory and approximation.\\" ALEA Latin American Journal of Probabability and Mathematical Statistics 13 (2016): 635‚Äì658.  Probability mass function  The Conway‚ÄìMaxwell‚Äìbinomial (CMB) distribution has probability mass function : Pr(Y=j)=frac{1}{C_{n,p, u}}binom{n}{j}^ u p^j(1-p)^{n-j},,qquad jin{0,1,ldots,n}, where ninmathbb{N}={1,2,ldots}, 0leq pleq1 and -infty< u<infty. The normalizing constant C_{n,p, u} is defined by : C_{n,p, u}=sum_{i=0}^nbinom{n}{i}^ u p^i(1-p)^{n-i}. If a random variable Y has the above mass function, then we write Ysimoperatorname{CMB}(n,p, u). The case u=1 is the usual binomial distribution Ysimoperatorname{Bin}(n,p).  Relation to Conway‚ÄìMaxwell‚ÄìPoisson distribution  The following relationship between Conway‚ÄìMaxwell‚ÄìPoisson (CMP) and CMB random variables generalises a well-known result concerning Poisson and binomial random variables. If X_1sim operatorname{CMP}(lambda_1, u) and X_2sim operatorname{CMP}(lambda_2, u) are independent, then X_1,,X_1+X_2=nsimoperatorname{CMB}(n,lambda_1/(lambda_1+lambda_2), u).  Sum of possibly associated Bernoulli random variables  The random variable Ysimoperatorname{CMB}(n,p, u) may be written as a sum of exchangeable Bernoulli random variables Z_1,ldots,Z_n satisfying : Pr(Z_1=z_1,ldots,Z_n=z_n)=frac{1}{C_{n,p, u}}binom{n}{k}^{ u-1}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}, where k=z_1+cdots+z_n. Note that operatorname{E}Z_1 ot=p in general, unless u=1.  Generating functions  Let : T(x, u)=sum_{k=0}^n x^kbinom{n}{k}^ u. Then, the probability generating function, moment generating function and characteristic function are given, respectively, by: : G(t)=frac{T(tp/(1-p), u)}{T(p(1-p), u)}, : M(t)=frac{T(mathrm{e}^tp/(1-p), u)}{T(p(1-p), u)}, : varphi(t)=frac{T(mathrm{e}^{mathrm{i}t}p/(1-p), u)}{T(p(1-p), u)}.  Moments  For general u, there do not exist closed form expressions for the moments of the CMB distribution. The following neat formula is available, however. Let (j)_r=j(j-1)cdots(j-r+1) denote the falling factorial. Let Ysimoperatorname{CMB}(n,p, u), where u>0. Then : operatorname{E}[((Y)_r)^ u]=frac{C_{n-r,p, u}}{C_{n,p, u}}((n)_r)^ u p^r,, for r=1,ldots,n-1.  Mode  Let Ysimoperatorname{CMB}(n,p, u) and define : a=frac{n+1}{1+left(frac{1-p}{p}right)^{1/ u}}. Then the mode of Y is lfloor arfloor if a is not an integer. Otherwise, the modes of Y are a and a-1.  Stein characterisation  Let Ysimoperatorname{CMB}(n,p, u), and suppose that f:mathbb{Z}^+mapstomathbb{R} is such that operatorname{E}f(Y+1)<infty and operatorname{E}Y^ u f(Y)<infty. Then : operatorname{E}[p(n-Y)^ u f(Y+1)-(1-p)Y^ u f(Y)]=0.  Approximation by the Conway‚ÄìMaxwell‚ÄìPoisson distribution  Fix lambda>0 and u>0 and let Y_nsimmathrm{CMB}(n,lambda/n^ u, u) Then Y_n converges in distribution to the mathrm{CMP}(lambda, u) distribution as nrightarrowinfty. This result generalises the classical Poisson approximation of the binomial distribution.  Conway‚ÄìMaxwell‚ÄìPoisson binomial distribution  Let X_1,ldots,X_n be Bernoulli random variables with joint distribution given by : Pr(X_1=x_1,ldots,X_n=x_n)=frac{1}{C_n'}binom{n}{k}^{ u-1} prod_{j=1}^np_j^{x_j}(1-p_j)^{1-x_j}, where k=x_1+cdots+x_n and the normalizing constant C_n^prime is given by : C_n'=sum_{k=0}^n binom{n}{k}^{ u-1} sum_{Ain F_k} prod_{iin A} p_i prod_{jin A^c}(1-p_j), where : F_k=left{Asubseteq{1,ldots,n}:A=kright}. Let W=X_1+cdots+X_n. Then W has mass function : Pr(W=k)=frac{1}{C_n'}binom{n}{k}^{ u-1}sum_{Ain F_k}prod_{iin A}p_iprod_{jin A^c}(1-p_j), for k=0,1,ldots,n. This distribution generalises the Poisson binomial distribution in a way analogous to the CMP and CMB generalisations of the Poisson and binomial distributions. Such a random variable is therefore said to follow the Conway‚ÄìMaxwell‚ÄìPoisson binomial (CMPB) distribution. This should not be confused with the rather unfortunate terminology Conway‚ÄìMaxwell‚ÄìPoisson‚Äìbinomial that was used by for the CMB distribution. The case u=1 is the usual Poisson binomial distribution and the case p_1=cdots=p_n=p is the operatorname{CMB}(n,p, u) distribution.

Leach's \\"ideal model\\" of a gumlau system noted that gumlau villages tended to cluster in a confederation with no village being superior, and that there was no heredity class system with the associated customary tributes from villagers to chiefs. Leach also wrote that Mayu-Dama was not essential to gumlau and that where it was, differences in rank were minimised by keeping the bride price low or by forming circles.

Leiden, Boston. notes that although Leach claimed that gumlau societies formed marriage circles within the mayu-dama system in order to minimize class relations, he did not find evidence of this in the areas Leach described, but did find that marriage circles were also a part of gumsa societies. In gumlau societies, justice was delivered by a council of elders which were not necessarily heredity. The Gumlau system acted as a mechanism against states as its ideology rejected chiefs or even killed those who tried to claim dominant positions. During the British colonial period, gumlau villages often termed \\"republics\\" by the colonials made navigating Kachinland difficult and the area difficult to govern, hence the British aimed to suppress gumlau rebellions or systems.Seekins, D. M. 2017. Historical Dictionary of Burma (Myanmar). Rowman and Littlefield. p.286 While Gumlau is not today used as a word to mean social system, many of the ideals described by Leach and others can be found in gumrawng gumtsa or zaw gumsa system. History The origins of gumlau are described in Kawlu Ma Nawng's 1942 book The History of the Kachins of the Hukawng Valley which describes origin stories occurring 300‚Äì400 years before its publication. In one of the accounts, Dumsa La Lawn makes an offering to a sky spirit called Sinlap who shows him a bird's eye view of gumlau and gumsa villages, explaining that in gumlau villages all men were equal and unlike gumsa villages, men did not have to make customary offerings of animal thighs to chiefs. Following his return to the world, the Dumsa and the chief of the village begin a feud which culminates in the Dumsa killing the chief and beginning a gumlau rebellion. A second origin story describes the \\"Blacksmith-Priest\\" rebellion started by the N'Dup Dumsa lineage who rebelled against their treatment from their relatives who saw them as lower status due to the circumstances of their birth.Kawlu Ma Nawng. 1942.

In the 1860s, violent Gumlau rebellions occurred in Kachinland, emanating from the Triangle region.Sadan, M. (2013) Being and Becoming Kachin.

To the Tatar regiment also was assigned lieutenant colonel of the 10th Novgorod H.M. King of W√ºrttemberg's dragoon regiment, Prince Feyzullah Mirza Qajar. In early August 1914, was announced the beginning of the recording of volunteers. According to the records of the Elisabethpol Governorate by August 27 more than two thousand Muslim volunteers have registered in the Tatar regiment. Due to the fact that only 400 people were required, including one hundred from Azerbaijanis, residents of Borchali county of Tiflis Governorate, further recording was stopped. During his stay in Tiflis in November 1914 Nicholas II appealed to the deputation of Muslims with the following words: By early September, the formation of the Tatar Cavalry Regiment was completed. Soon the regiment marched to Armavir, designated as the assembly point of the units of the Caucasian Native Cavalry Division.–†. –ù. –ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤. –ì–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞–ª-–∞–¥—ä—é—Ç–∞–Ω—Ç –ï–≥–æ –í–µ–ª–∏—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞. –°–∫–∞–∑–∞–Ω–∏–µ –æ –ì—É—Å—Å–µ–π–Ω- –•–∞–Ω–µ –ù–∞—Ö–∏—á–µ–≤–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–º. ‚Äì –ú.: –ì–µ—Ä–æ–∏ –û—Ç–µ—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞, 2006, —Å.156‚Äì157 At the end of September, the regiments were transferred to Ukraine, where they continued to prepare for combat work.

Colonel of the Kabarda Cavalry Regiment, Duke Fyodor Nikolayevich Bekovich-Cherkassky was appointed the commander of the Tatar Horse Regiment. On May 31, 1916, Colonel Bekovich-Cherkassky, having received an order to dislodge the enemy from the village of Tyshkovtsi, personally led three sotnias of the Tatar regiment to attack under a hurricane of fire from the Austrians. Cavalry attack of regiment led to successful capture of the territory. Until the middle of the day, the Austrians several times tried to retake Tyshkovtsi, but to no avail. After a while, two hundred Chechens of Colonel Qajar, two guns of the horse-mountain division and a battalion of the infantry of the Trans Amur regiment came to the rescue of the Tatar regiment. During the day, they fought off 5 attacks of the enemy. In addition to the 177 prisoners, the Austrians lost 256 people killed. For this battle, the commander of the Tatar regiment, Colonel Prince Bekovich- Cherkassky, was put forward for the Order of St. George the Victorious of the 3rd degree. During the entire period of the war, Colonel duke Bekovich- Cherkassky was the only officer from the natives of the division, nominated to the Order of St. George 3rd degree. In the first decade of June, the Tatar Cavalry Regiment, as part of the 2nd Brigade of the Division, fought in the west of Chernivtsi. Overcoming the stubborn resistance of the enemy, by the middle of June brigade reached the Cheremosh River, on the opposite shore of which the Austrians were entrenched. On June 15, the Chechen and Tatar regiments, under the heavy fire of the enemy, crossed the river and immediately seized the village of Rostock, began to advance northwestward towards the Bukovina Carpathians in the direction of Vorokhta in the upper reaches of the Prut River. On May 7, the commander of the Chechen Cavalry Regiment Colonel Prince Feyzulla Mirza Kajar was promoted to major general for the battle distinction, and on May 30 of the same year, he was appointed commander of the 2nd brigade.

He was replaced as the commander of the Tatar Cavalry Regiment by colonel, duke Levan Luarsabovich Magalov. On May 22, the chief of staff of the division Major-General P.A. Polovtsov was appointed commander-in- chief of the troops of the Petrograd Military District. From the telegram of P.A. Polovtsov to Mammad Khan Ziyadkhanov, who was one of the initiators of the formation of the Tatar Regiment: Jamshid Nakhchivanski was a Russian Imperial, Azerbaijani and Soviet military commander. He rose to the rank of Combrig (equivalent to Brigadier General) in the Soviet Army. During the summer offensive of the troops of the Southwestern Front, as part of the 2nd Brigade, the Tatar Cavalry Regiment operated to the west of the Stanislavov. For battle at Kalush the commander of the Azerbaijani Regiment Levan Magalov, lieutenant Jamshid Khan Nakhchivanski, cornets duke Khaitbey Shervashidze and count Nicholas Bobrinsky were awarded with St. George crosses of the 4th degree. In the hardest conditions of the summer of 1917, when the front was broken, the Russian army was demoralized, and parts of it ran erratically from positions, the Caucasian warriors stood to death. From the article \\"Faithful Sons of Russia\\" published in \\"Morning of Russia\\": Numerous combat awards were granted to the soldiers of the Tatar Cavalry Regiment. Some of them, for example Alibek Nabibekov, Sayad Zeynalov, Mehdi Ibragimov, Alekper Khadzhiev, Datso Daurov, Alexander Kaitukov, became full cavaliers of the Cross of St. George, i.e. they got all four degrees of the award. Osman Aga Gulmamedov was awarded with three St. George crosses and three St. George medals. Zeynal Beck Sadikhov, who started the service as a non-commissioned officer in a team of scouts, earned three Georgievsky crosses and a St. George medal, and after promotion to officer degree for battle honor he was awarded with four military orders. During the war years, nearly sixty officers of different nationalities passed through the service in the Tatar (Azerbaijani) Regiment. Approximately half of them were Russian officers, as well as Azerbaijanis, Georgians, Kabardians, Ossetians, Abkhazians. There also were officers of Ukrainian, German, Tatar, Scottish, French and Polish descent. Among them lieutenant- colonels Alexander Albrecht and Nukh Bek Sofiev, rittmeister Sergey Bagretsov, staff rittmeisters Nikolai Kazbegi, Suleiman Bek Sultanov, Mikhail Horanov, lieutenant Selim Bek Sultanov, cornets Andrew Bers, Charles Testenoire, ensigns from volunteers Count Mikhail Muravyov-Amursky, Prince Idris Aga Qajar and others. At the end of August 1917, it was decided to reform the Caucasian Native Cavalry Division into the Caucasian Native Cavalry Corps. For this, the Dagestan and Ossetian cavalry regiments were transferred to the division. After the formation, the corps was to be sent to the Caucasus at the disposal of the commander of the Caucasian army.  Disbandment  In late September ‚Äì early October 1917, units and subunits of the corps, including the Tatar regiment, were transferred to the Caucasus. The headquarters of the corps was in Vladikavkaz, and the headquarters of the First Caucasian Native Cavalry Division in Pyatigorsk. After the October Revolution in Petrograd, the corps retained its organization as a military unit for a short time. However, by January 1918, the Caucasian native cavalry corps had ceased to exist. At the end of 1917, by the decision of the Special Transcaucasian Committee started the process of formation of the Muslim (Azerbaijani) corps under the command of Lieutenant-General Ali-Agha ShikhlinskiAli-Agha Shikhlinski. My Memoirs. Baku, 1944, p.186. The corps was formed by the end of April ‚Äì early May 1918. The Tatar (Azerbaijani) cavalry regiment was also incorporated into the corps.

It has white flowers that appear in late spring after the leaves. Although first collected in 1882, it was not scientifically described until 1990. It is now known from only four populations in the Vaucluse department in south-east France, around Mont Ventoux and the River Nesque. It is considered to be a \\"threatened species\\". Description Acis fabrei is a small bulbous perennial plant. Each bulb produces one to four narrow leaves, 2 to 5 mm wide and up to 30 cm long, averaging around 17 cm. The leaves appear before the flowers. Flowering takes place in late spring with the flowers held considerably below the top of leaves. There is usually a single flower to each stem (peduncle), with six white tepals, 10‚Äì11 mm long, carried on a stalk (pedicel) 5‚Äì11 mm long. The flower bud is enclosed in a spathe that is divided into two segments. The style is slightly longer than the six stamens. The smooth black seeds are 2‚Äì3 mm long. The whole plant dies down in early summer. Taxonomy Acis fabrei was first collected in 1882 on the southern slopes of Mont Ventoux. Specimens were sent to the National Museum of Natural History in Paris by the entomologist Jean-Henri Fabre. It was only re-discovered in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1990, it was first described as a new species, as Leucojum fabrei. In 2004, it was transferred to Acis, along with other species of Leucojum, on the basis of a molecular phylogenetic study. It resembles Acis nicaeensis, which has an overlapping distribution, but can be distinguished by several characters, including wider leaves, longer pedicels, and a larger distance between the stigma and the anthers. Distribution and habitat , Acis fabrei was only known from four populations in the Vaucluse department in south-east France, around Mont Ventoux and the River Nesque. All the populations are within 20 km of one another. Plants are found in eroded soils poor in organic matter, such as terra rossa, in rocky glades, grassy areas and under Quercus pubescens. Conservation , Acis fabrei was not listed in the IUCN Red List, although listed as a \\"threatened species\\" in the French . The species occurs in a generally protected region of France; two populations are in an area with a management plan that includes Acis fabrei. One threat is the natural and deliberate expansion of forests, which produces closed canopies and, where the trees are pines or cedars, more acid soils through the build-up of leaf litter. Wild boars are another threat as they can destroy many individual plants.

It was initially confused with what is now Acis valentina, a species found in Spain near Valencia. Description Acis ionica is a bulbous plant with narrow leaves, 12‚Äì22 cm long but only 2‚Äì3 mm wide. The leaves appear after flowering, which is in the autumn. The flowering stalk (scape) is usually 8‚Äì20 cm tall, with an inflorescence composed of two to four flowers, occasionally only one or as many as six. The inflorescence is subtended by two spathes, usually extending to below the level of the highest flower. Each flower opens widely and is borne on a stem (pedicel) about 16‚Äì28 mm long. The six tepals are white, generally 9‚Äì13 mm long. The outer three tepals have pointed tips. The pedicel lengthens after flowering. The black seeds are about 3 mm long. Taxonomy Acis species were at one time placed in the genus Leucojum. What is now considered to be Acis ionica was initially confused with Leucojum valentinum (Acis valentina), a species found in Spain near Valencia. Doubts over this identification began around 1990, and both morphological and molecular evidence began to suggest that it was a distinct species. It was first described as a separate species in 2004 as Leucojum ionicum. Separately, and on the basis of a different type, Acis ionica was described in 2006 by Pepy Bareka, Georgia Kamari and Dimitrios Phitos. In 2019, Arne Strid treated both taxa as the same species based on the very limited differences between their characters. In order to transfer the first published name, Leucojum ionicum, to the genus Acis, Strid considered that it was necessary to use a replacement name (nomen novum) to avoid creating a homonym of the already published Acis ionica. For this purpose, Strid published the name Acis orientalis. A different view is adopted by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families, namely that the next published name, Acis ionica, should be used, making Strid's replacement name superfluous and hence illegitimate. Although similar in appearance to A. valentina, genetically it is as distinct as any other species of Acis. Compared to A. valentina, it has a thinner scape (flower stalk), broader inner tepals, and its flowers open more widely. Distribution and habitat Acis ionica is found in western Greece, on the islands of Zakynthos, Kefalonia and Lefkas, with populations on the nearby mainland of Greece and further north in coastal Albania (close to the city of Vlor√´). It is found on calcareous soils, in open, stony or rocky ground and on hillsides, usually not far from the sea and at altitudes below 350 m.

Its white flowers appear in spring. It is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant, but is not fully frost-hardy. Description Acis longifolia resembles Acis trichophylla, but is smaller. The thin leaves are longer than the flowering stem. The flowers, which appear in spring, are borne in groups of usually two to four, each on a slender pedicel (stalk) up to 25 mm long. The flowers are 8‚Äì11 mm long, with tepals lacking points at the end and styles shorter than the stamens. There are two spathes, longer than the pedicels. Taxonomy Acis longifolia was first described in 1847 in a work by Max Roemer, who attributed the name to Jaques Gay. In 1855, Jean Grenier transferred the species to Leucojum. In 2004, it was transferred back to Acis, along with other species of Leucojum, on the basis of a molecular phylogenetic study. Distribution and habitat Acis longifolia is endemic to Corsica, where it is found among rocks and on mountain slopes up to about 500 m in elevation, often in partly shaded conditions. Cultivation Acis longifolia is rare in cultivation; it is not fully hardy, requiring protection in cold area, such as in an alpine house or bulb frame.

The settlement did not require a restitution offer, registration of tokens, or any disqualifications.  block.one, EOSIO Ecosystem and Everipedia block.one is a company registered in the Cayman Islands, which began offering EOS tokens in June 2017 to the public, raising over $4 billion (a record for an ICO). Daniel Larimer is currently the Chief Technology Officer of block.one, notable for his role in building Bitshares, a decentralized exchange, building Steemit, a decentralized social media platform, developing delegated proof-of-stake and proposing the idea of a decentralized autonomous corporation. On December 6, 2017, Everipedia, a for-profit, wiki-based online encyclopedia, announced plans using EOS blockchain technology and work on an airdrop of a cryptocurrency called IQ to encourage generating information. The IQ tokens are intended to be exchangeable for Bitcoin. One of the goals of the company is to stop certain countries from blocking the content, by the integration of the blockchain model. The goal is that once Everipedia is decentralized and hosted on the EOSIO platform, countries such as Turkey and Iran that block Wikipedia will no longer be able to block it, via Everipedia's fork. Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Investment LP, a cryptocurrency investment firm, and block.one led a group of institutions that invested $30 million in Everipedia on February 8, 2018. Novogratz also funds EOSIO Ecosystem, a $325-million joint venture between his Galaxy Digital LP and block.one.

Cassidy was awarded the American Psychological Association Boyd McCandless Young Scientist Award in 1991 for her early career contributions to Developmental Psychology. She is a Fellow of the American Psychological Association, Division 7 (Developmental Psychology) and the Association for Psychological Science. Cassidy co-edited the Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research, and Clinical Implications with Phillip Shaver. She is the author of two monographs on attachment theory published by the Society for Research in Child Development. One of these monographs, Security in infancy, childhood, and adulthood: A move to the level of representation, cited 6229 times according to GoogleScholar, provided new insight into individual differences in parent-infant attachment relations as assessed through the Strange Situation. Cassidy currently serves as co-editor of the journal Attachment and Human Development.  Biography  Cassidy received a B.A. in English (magna cum laude) from Duke University. She subsequently attended New York University where she obtained an M.F.A. Cassidy then pursued graduate studies in Developmental Psychology at the University of Virginia where she completed her Ph.D under the supervision of Mary Ainsworth in 1986. Cassidy joined the faculty of Psychology at Pennsylvania State University in 1988 where she remained until 1996. She moved to the University of Maryland in 1996 and was promoted to Full Professor in 1999. Her research has been funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, and the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Cassidy delivered the John Bowlby Memorial Lecture in 2010.  Research  Cassidy's research program focuses on attachment, family relationships, and social and emotional development in children and adolescents. Her work expanded the attachment behavioral system developed by John Bowlby, which described internal working models as organized frameworks for understanding the world, developed by infants through experience with their caregivers. Cassidy's work linked secure attachment patterns in infancy with the development of empathy and altruism, school readiness, and successful peer relationships, and insecure patterns of attachment with child psychopathology. Cassidy‚Äôs work with Mary Main led to the identification of disorganized attachment, the fourth category of attachment styles in the Strange Situation. In this rare form of attachment, children will react inconsistently and often in a confused manner when presented with toys, strangers, and the separation and reunion with the mom. Cassidy, along Mary Main and George Kaplan, found that a parent's ‚Äústate of mind with respect to attachment‚Äù was predictive of his or her infant's pattern of attachment, which suggested intergenerational transmission of attachment patterns. Her research on attachment theory has important clinical applications for understanding addiction and for developing educational efforts to foster secure parent-child relationships.

Increased QTV appears to be a marker of arrhythmic and cardiovascular death; it may also play a role for noninvasive assessment of sympathetic nervous system activity. Other terms used include: \\"QT variability\\", \\"beat-to-beat variability of ventricular repolarization (BRV)\\" Beat-to-beat measurement of QT interval using two-dimensional signal warping (2DSW).  QT interval measurement  Under normal resting conditions, beat-to-beat changes in QT interval are very small with a standard deviation typically below 5 ms. Digital high resolution ECG sampled at 300 Hz or higher and dedicated computer algorithms are required for QTV assessment. Template-based algorithms that use parts of, or the entire ECG waveform usually deliver good results; template stretching or warping techniques perform comparably well in the presence of noise.  QTV Analysis  A number of metrics have been proposed for QTV quantification. The QT variability index (QTVi) has been most frequently reported in the literature: QTVi = logfrac{SDQT^2/(QT_{mean})^2}{SDHR^2/(HR_{mean})^2} , where SDQT, SDHR, QT_{mean}, and HR_{mean} denote standard deviation and mean of QT interval and heart rate time series, respectively. More advanced approaches that take into account the relationship between QTV and heart rate variability include vector autoregressive process models and information domain approaches.

Prior to his appointment in 2015 when Mxolisi Nxasana stepped down as NDPP, Abrahams had been a senior state advocate in the Priority Crimes Litigation Unit. Questions were immediately raised about the manner in which he had been promoted ahead of more senior prosecutors. Abrahams had joined the NPA as an administrative clerk in a provincial office while completing his legal studies. He holds B Iuris, B Proc and LLB degrees, which he read part-time at the University of Natal, Pietermaritzburg.Brief Resum√©, npa.gov.za Abrahams has been seen as complicit in helping President Jacob Zuma avoid corruption charges, and was given the nickname Shaun The Sheep as a result. Abrahams has described himself as \\"nobody‚Äôs man\\". Abrahams' appointment was challenged by Freedom Under Law, and on 8 December 2017, his appointment was set aside by a full bench of the High Court, finding that he was irregularly appointed. The court also ruled that President Zuma was conflicted and therefore a replacement should be appointed by the Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa instead, and this must be done within 60 days. The NPA appealed this ruling, but in August 2018, the Constitutional Court ordered that Shaun Abrahams vacate his position as NDPP and President Cyril Ramaphosa appoint a new NDPP within 90 days. Abrahams reportedly retired from the NPA with benefits, but the NPA declined to comment on such employment-related matters. Abrahams said he would not be lost to the legal fraternity. Abrahams was succeeded as NDPP by Silas Ramaite in an acting capacity. His successor, Shamila Batohi, was appointed NDPP on 4 December 2018 and assumed office in February 2019.

He is remembered as one of the best known lyric poets in the German Democratic Republic. He wrote song lyrics, dramas and prose pieces. He was particularly well known for his popular love poems. At the time of his death the Leipziger Volkszeitung (newspaper) reported that around four million copies of volumes of his poetry had been sold.  Life  Heinz Kahlau was born into a working- class family at Drewitz, a small town at that time just outside Potsdam. After leaving school in 1945 he worked as an unskilled labourer in various sectors, at one stage as an electrician and at another as a \\"wood turner\\". In 1948 he obtained a job driving a tractor. By this time the war had ended, with a large strip of territory in the centre of the country - which included Potsdam - administered, since May 1945, as the Soviet occupation zone. In 1948 he took a job as an official of the Free German Youth (\\"Freie Deutsche Jugend\\" / FDJ). The FDJ was in effect the youth wing of the recently constructed Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED) which by this time was well on the way to becoming the ruling party in a new kind of Germany one-party dictatorship. Kahlau became an SED party member in 1948, but sources indicate that he lost his membership in 1949 or 1950, which was a little unusual. In 1949 he relocated to nearby Berlin. He later wrote, that his first poems were \\"written by a nineteen year old whose relationship to poetry, up to that point, had been the worst imaginable\\" (\\"Mein erstes Gedicht wurde von einem 19-J√§hrigen geschrieben, dessen Beziehungen zur Poesie bis dahin die denkbar schlechtesten waren\\"). His stepfather thought that reading made you stupid and threw any printed material that came his way into the fire. However, in 1949 Kahlau was sent away for half a year to a TB clinic at Rathenow where he had \\"his first pleasant encounter with poems\\" and wrote his own first verses. He characterised himself as thin-skinned at that time in his poem \\"Wei√üer Mann\\" (loosely: \\"white/pale Man\\"): he had \\"suffered till he was nineteen from depression, delusion and heightened anxiety. Sometimes he hid away from people. Since then he writes poems\\". Kahlau began to publish his poems in 1950. These included \\"Agitprop\\" songs and verses. He studied between 1953 and 1956 at the (East German) Academy of Arts (\\" Akademie der K√ºnste\\"), where he was picked out as a \\"Master student\\" (\\"Meistersch√ºler\\") and taught by Bertolt Brecht. In later years he would gratefully recall how Brecht had taught him to recognise \\"life's contradictions\\", and to write using simple, clear language. \\"Hope lives in the branches of the Caiba\\" (\\"Hoffnung lebt in den Zweigen der Caiba\\"), his first full volume of poetry, was published in 1954. After completing his formal studies in 1956 he became a freelance author and scriptwriter. In Autumn 1956 he was participating in the so-called \\"Thursday circle\\" (\\"Donnerstag-Kreis\\") of young artists and intellectuals that came together following the violent suppression of the Hungarian uprising. In 1957 the authorities determined that verse written by Kahlau had been critical of the fraternal invasion of Hungary. He had already stirred serious controversy a couple of months before the Soviet tanks rolled into Budapest with a speech delivered in June 1956 to a Congress of Young Artists at Karl- Marx-Stadt (as Chemnitz was then known). He condemned \\"what he called the fascist methods used by the supposedly anti-fascist authorities\\". He decried \\"what he saw as the petty bourgeois attitudes of many functionaries and workers and proclaimed that it was young writers ... answerable only to their own conscience, who [should] shape the future of socialism in Germany\\". He advocated \\"thoroughgoing deStalinization and complete transparency\\" at the level of the national leadership. It was not the only speech delivered at that congress that was, by the standards of an older generation that had learned not to speak out of turn, critical of the authorities, but it seems to have been the most outspoken. Threatened with imprisonment, in 1957 Kahlau became an unoffocial collaborator (informant) for the Ministry for State Security (Stasi). He is listed in the Stasi records under the code name \\"GI (Geheimer Informator) Hochschulz\\". In 1964 he succeeded in revoking the \\"Statement of duty/obligation\\" (\\"Verpflichtungserkl√§rung\\") that he had signed in 1957. During the intervening years he had been prolific in producing poems as well as dramas and radio plays, along with children's books and song lyrics. His public reputation had grown correspondingly: he was also winning various literary prizes and official national honours during this period. Unlike many who had passed information to the surveillance authorities under similar circumstances, during the changes of 1989/90, in May 1990 Heinz Kahlau was one of the first to make his former collaboration with the Stasi public. Despite the unusual circumstances of his withdrawal from the list of Stasi collaborators, his popularity was evidently not impeded by the authorities during the 1960s and 1970s, although there is no evidence that he returned to his former engagement in public criticism. During his time as a Stasi informant he had indeed produced poems that seemed to endorse the fortification of the inner German border - officially to protect the country against invasion from the west, but believed by critics to be designed to stop the escape of working-age East German citizens to the west. (There had been a chronic labour shortage since the 1940s.) Kahlau became a member of the German section of PEN International in 1965. In 1972 his party membership was restored. For ten years, between 1970 and 1980, he led the organisation's East German division. He also worked with the rock bands Karat and Bayon, producing song lyrics. Later, between 1987 and 1990, and again between 1991 and 1993, Kahlau served as a member of the nation executive with the (before 1990 \\"East\\") \\"German Writers' Association (\\"Deutscher Schriftstellerverband \\"). Also in the aftermath of reunification, between 1990 and 1992 Heinz Kahlau served as a PDS local councillor in Berlin's Pankow quarter. When he was 75 Kahlau moved with his family from Berlin to Usedom where he spent his final years, still working as an author. It was here that he died - as his widow put it \\"slowly\\" - of heart failure. He died in a clinic, but his body was buried at the cemetery of Stolpe auf Usedom near his island home.  Contribution  During his lifetime, approximately twenty volumes of his poetry appeared. His best known compilation is \\"Du\\" (\\"Thee\\"), a volume of love poems. He was one of East Germany's most read poets, which was only partly because of the official backing his work received from the state.

She converted to Catholicism in 1853, and spent time with her husband converting the rest of the Island. During her later life, she was visited by many European travellers, including Robert Louis Stevenson. Early life Vaekehu was the youngest of two daughters of Paetini, who was a descendant of the prominent Chiefly house on Nuka Hiva. Paetini's husband was the High Chief of the Taioha'e on the islands, but she also had several secondary husbands. Vaekehu was married to a Hapa'a chief and had a daughter, who died in childhood as did her husband around the same time. Her elder sister married Temoana, and after her death, due to local custom, Vaekehu and Temoana were married. She adopted her niece and nephew, although both died before her. As with other local customs, Vaekehu was extensively tattooed, which was written about and drawn by many European visitors. Vaekehu described the pain she suffered while being tattooed, telling Albert Davin that she wished to be killed at the time to stop the pain. Marriage to Temoana Temoana and Vaekehu were considered to be the King and Queen of Nuka Hiva by the French Empire. They received support from the French, despite Temoana's increasing erratic behaviour caused by excessive alcohol consumption. After an Italian named Motto managed to have the King arrested for plotting against the French, Vaekehu was among those who managed to have him released. However, with the French planning an attack, Vaekehu created a French tricolour flag in order to show that they were loyal. Despite the flag being raised, the French were convinced by Motto to attack anyway. Temoana and Vaekehu were exiled to Tahiti on 8 October 1852, but were returned after only ten days by the Governor of the island. When they arrived back at Nuka Hiva, they stayed with the Catholic Bishop on the Island as their property had been destroyed. The Governor arrived the following January and reinstated Temoana and Veekehu as King and Queen, fired Motto and reprimanded the French commander. Their entire family were baptised on 29 June 1853. They took westernised names, with Vaekehu adopting Elisabeth. The Bishop, Dordillion, was later adopted by Vaekehu as a grandson to provide him protection as a member of her family. They worked together to promote Catholicism on the Island extensively, with Temoana undertaking wars against neighbouring tribes to convert them. After the French ship Diamant left 12 dying crewmen in the hands of missionaries on the island, smallpox was introduced to Nuka Hiva. In the following seven months, 1500 islanders died. Around the same time, Temoana died of pleurisy on 12 September 1863. Vaekehu continued to reign on her own as Queen. Later life A drawing of Vaekehu by Pierre Loti, published in 1872 With the Nuka Hiva culture collapsing due to the ongoing deaths and the influence of the French, Vaekehu retreated to the mission compound and devoted herself to religion. She continued to receive European visitors, who spoke of her growing family with several adopted members. These included Robert Louis Stevenson, Pierre Loti and Karl von den Steinen. Although they spoke of her great dignity, they also said that she would enjoy telling stories, claiming to have eaten her first husband. She spent her time with Catholic nuns, and refused to engage with the traditions of the old religion of the island referring to them as pagan in nature. Nine years after his death, she held a feast day for Temoana, which combined the Island traditions with a more sobre Catholic mass. She long thought that she was about to die, having received her last rights in 1872. She had already organised a coffin for herself by the time Stevenson visited her, and died in June 1901. She was placed in a mausoleum next to Temoana near the Catholic mission. She was known as the last Queen of the island.

After the war, she worked as a darkroom technician for the police in Victoria, British Columbia.  Early life  Pike was born July 23, 1922 in Winnipeg, Manitoba. She had three siblings. She was the youngest. As a child, Pike enjoyed assisting her older brother in his photography lab, and when she was older she found a job in the photography department of Eaton's. Eaton's was a department store.  Career and marriage  In early 1943, Pike offered her services as a photographer to the Royal Canadian Navy, and in February she was accepted as a probationary recruit in the Women's Royal Canadian Naval Service. Her father supported her and helped her write letters to apply for the job. His act of support was not the norm at the time. In August, Pike took a photography training course in Ottawa, and was one of only seven female recruits in the class. In February 1944, Pike was sent to London, England. When the D-Day invasions began, Pike helped develop the first incoming photos from the D-Day landings. She was the only female photographer in the darkroom team. After the war, Pike married Donovan Pike, a childhood friend and navy officer. They lived in Victoria, British Columbia, and the couple had two children.

There are the most visited among the five groups of Jain rock carvings on the Gwalior Fort hill. They were built over time starting in the 7th- century, but most are dated to the 15th-century CE. Many of the statues were defaced and destroyed under the orders of the Muslim Emperor Babur of the Mughal dynasty in the 16th century, while a few repaired and restored after the fall of the Mughal dynasty and through the late 19th century. The statues depict all 24 Tirthankaras. They are shown in both seated Padmasana posture as well as standing Kayotsarga posture, in the typical naked form of Jain iconography. The reliefs behind some of them narrate scenes from the Jain legends. The site is about from the South-East Group of Gopachal rock cut Jain monuments and about northwest of the Teli ka Mandir within the Gwalior Fort.  Location  The Siddhachal collosi cave temples are located inside fortifications of the Urvahi valley, a part of the fort of Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, immediately below the northwestern walls of the fortress. The Gwalior city and the fort is connected to other Indian cities by major highways NH 44 and 46 (Asian Highway 43 and 47), a railway station and airport (IATA: GWL). It is located near other historic Hindu and Jain temples from the medieval era.Group of temples at Batesar, ASI Bhopal Circle (2014)Naresar Temples, ASI Bhopal Circle (2014)  History  The Siddhachal cave temples are a part of nearly 100 Jain monuments found in and around the Gwalior city, all dated to be from the 7th to 15th century. The Siddachal colossi are near the Urwahi road, and most are dated to be from the 15th century, built in an era when Delhi Sultanate had collapsed and fragmented, a Hindu kingdom was back in power in Gwalior region and before Babur had ended the Delhi Sultanate and replaced it with his Mughal dynasty. The inscriptions found near the monuments credit them to the Tomar kings, and they range from the 1440 to 1453 CE. The Siddhachal Caves were complete by about 1473 CE. Some 60 years after they had been completed, the statues were defaced and desecrated around 1527 when the Emperor Babur ordered their destruction.Gwalior Fort: Rock Sculptures, A Cunningham, Archaeological Survey of India, pages 364-370, Quote: \\"In 1527, the Urvahi Jinas were mutilated by the Mughal emperor Babar, a fact he records in his memoirs\\". Babur explained in a memoir, The Jain cave temples within the Gwalior Fort were, however, not destroyed, just mutilated by chopping off the faces, the sexual organs and their limbs. Centuries later, the Jain community restored many of the statues by adding back stucco heads on the top of the damaged idols.  Description  Meditating Jinas, Siddhachal Caves, Gwalior Fort The Siddhachal Caves are rock-cut monuments with Jain collosi. They are found on both sides of the slope of the Urwahi road in the fort, along the Urwahi valley. The monuments include many caves, small reliefs on the walls, as well as 22 colossi. The largest of these are for Rishabhanatha (Adinatha), identifiable by the bull emblem carved on the pedestal under his foot, with a height of .

There are about 1300 objects exhibited which are of Ethnological interest from the Kalasha Tradition and from the traditions of the wider Hindu Kush area. History Bumburet Valley Museum, also known as the Kalasha dur (House of the Kalasha People or Cultural Centre for the Kalasha). Kalasha Dur is a place where a number of collected objects could be displayed. Most of these objects were collected by the members of the N.G.O. (Non Governmental Organization) called the \\"Greek Volunteers¬ù\\" based in Greece. They had been working in the Kalasha dur valleys since 1995. =Ethnological collection= The building is composed of two floors; the ground floor has the Ethnological collection of the Kalasha culture and the wider hindu kush area and the other floor houses a school of Kalasha culture with a library of books written on the valley, and also a hall for professional training of local crafts. The members of the \\"Greek Volunteers\\" were responsible for much of the collection exhibited in the museum. Volunteers would visit the Kalasha Valleys with a view to buying traditional objects or to exchange them with modern ones. A lot of worry and anxiety were caused to the members of the \\"Greek Volunteers\\" when they noticed that the New Kalasha Generation would never see the traditional objects of their ancestors. This observation started the buying of objects, clothes and other typical items so that they will not go out of the valleys. Their first aim was to exhibit all these objects in an Ethnological Museum, so future generations will able to see and learn about the life of their ancestors. Later on, when the Kalasha Dur Museum was built the number of the collected objects started to increase. The many offerings by the Kalasha people and inhabitants of the Kalasha valleys to their Museum, has increased the number of items above those purchased. The Museum also purchased traditional utensils and other objects which had left the settlements of the Hindu Kush, from the antique shops of Peshawar and Chitral to enrich their collection.

Vargas took an interest in books early in life because of her uncle's interest and his large library of police and medieval fantasy novels, which would be the first books she read in her life. For this reason, Vargas decided to study literature, but her parents would not allow her to move to Guatemala City to study literature. Vargas's first work as a journalist came with local newspaper El Nuevo Quetzalteco, later shortened to El Quetzalteco, which covered red notes and tribunes, an experience that gave her much needed journalistic experience.

The cave is located in the village of Almonda, in the civil parish of Zibreira, in the municipality of Torres Novas in the district of Santar√©m. The cave contained stones from the Paleolithic Acheulean culture, and the skull of Homo heidelbergensis, circa 400,000 years old.

The entrance to the cave was completely sealed by roof collapses when the excavation began in 1998.Joan Daura et al.: New Middle Pleistocene hominin cranium from Gruta da Aroeira (Portugal). In: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) Online pre-release of 13 March 2017. The deposits in the cave are about four meters thick and are categorised in three stratigraphic layers, from the lowest of which the fossil Aroeira 3 was salvaged. Various independent analyses revealed an age of approximately 400,000 years, due to the detection of the oxygen isotope stage MIS 11c. The most recent deposits in the cave have been dated to an age of 60,000 to 40,000 years (MIS 3c). =First Exploration: Aroeira 1 and Aroeira 2= The Cave of Aroeira was first investigated from 1998‚Äì2002 revealing a rich lithic assemblage with Acheulean bifaces associated with faunal remains and two human teeth: Aroeira 1 (a left mandibular canine) and Aroeira 2 (a left maxillary third molar). Aroeira 1 is moderately large and Aroeira 2 is among the larger of the Middle Pleistocene upper right third molars. They fit morphologically within the known variation of European Middle Pleistocene dentitions, although Aroeira 2 has a relatively large hypocone. The faunal remains are highly fragmented, mainly consisting of isolated teeth, phalanges, carpal/tarsal bones, and antler fragments. Identified species include deer and equids predominantly, but also rhinoceros, bear as well as a large bovid (Bos/Bison), a caprid, and a Testudo tortoise. =Aroeira 3= Renewed fieldwork in 2013, focused on establishing the chronology of the sequence via U-series dating of interstratified flowstone deposits, led to the discovery of a partially preserved human cranium (Aroeira 3) encased in hard breccia toward the base of the sequence. The block containing the main portion of the cranium and the detached fragments were transported to the Conservation and Restoration Laboratory at the Complutense University of Madrid for further preparation. The cranium was restored over a period of two years. Although the taxonomic identity is debated, some authors prefer to group Aroeira 3 with other Middle Pleistocene fossils from Africa and Asia in a separate species, Homo heidelbergensis.

Description and history The Town Bridge is located in a rural-residential setting of southwestern Canton, north of the village of Collinsville and about west of Connecticut Route 179 on Town Bridge Road. It is a single-span Parker truss, with a total length of about , and a height above the river of about . It has a metal deck covered in asphalt, and carries a single lane of traffic. Its entrance portals are adorned with iron cresting. The bridge was built in 1895 for the town by the Berlin Iron Bridge Company, Connecticut's leading manufacturer of iron bridges at the time. The bridge is distinctive for a number of reasons. It is the only surviving Berlin bridge in the state that is not of lenticular truss design, which then predominated in the company's production, and is one of less than two dozen Berlin bridges left in the state (out of more than 100 originally built). It is one of only two Parker trusses with pinned connections, a method of connecting the truss members that gave way to riveted connections (also present on this structure) by about 1900. The bridge was built as part of a town program to improve all of its crossings of the swift- flowing and flood-prone Farmington River.

It was designed as an open access infrastructure that allows for interactive use and sustained growth. Three institutions, Royal Irish Academy (RIA), Trinity College, Dublin (TCD), and Maynooth (now Maynooth University or MU), currently manage the repository and implement its policies, guidelines and training. The Department of Education and Skills has primarily funded DRI since 2016 through the Higher Education Authority and the Irish Research Council. As of 2018, DRI is home to over 28,000 items.  History  The DRI was established in 2011 after receiving ‚Ç¨5.2 million in funding through the Irish government's Higher Education Authority. The Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions (PRTLI) would support the project for four years. Launched on 24 June 2015 at Croke Park, DRI began as a consortium of six Irish academic institutions: Royal Irish Academy (RIA), National University of Ireland, Maynooth (now Maynooth University or MU), Trinity College, Dublin (TCD), Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT), National University of Ireland, Galway (NUIG), and National College of Art and Design (NCAD). It earned the Data Seal of Approval as a Trusted Digital Repository (TDR) in 2015. In 2018, it was awarded the Core Trust Seal, superseding previous certification. DRI became a member of the Research Data Alliance in August 2018.  Organization  The governing body for DRI is a Management Board which is composed of representatives of each of the academic institutions, who serve three-year terms. The Core Implementation Team (CIT) is responsible for the day-to-day running of the Repository as well as strategy development, coordination and project delivery. The CIT is composed of the DRI Director, DRI Principal Investigators and Institutional representatives, and the DRI Programme Manager in RIA. In addition, an International Advisory Group of eight experts ensures DRI maintains ties with other digital repositories across the globe. The International Advisory Group meets annually to provide oversight and feedback and sustain best practices. DRI staff is composed of professionals from diverse backgrounds such as librarians, digital archivists, educators, and software engineers who support all aspects of governance, operations and management, and taskforces. As of 2018, there are fifteen full-time staff members. The DRI has three main areas of focus: Technology, Policy, and Education and Outreach. The technological software protects and preserves the data while allowing easy searching and navigation through the material. Development of policy protocols for data generation and preparation for archiving is a core remit of DRI. Education and Outreach include a training programme and direct contact with the public through workshops and newsletters.  Collections  = Types = DRI Collections cover historical and contemporary Irish cultural heritage. These may contain many different types of digital assets including but not limited to images, audio, and text. While some collections are aggregated from partners and members from heritage and research institutions across the country, users are invited to become depositors to enrich DRI's portrait of Ireland. Collection highlights include Letters of 1916, the Stained Glass Studios Archive, and multi-media content from Raidi√≥ Teilif√≠s √âireann. = Access = As an interactive repository, DRI is open to any kind of user with an interest in Irish cultural heritage regardless of age or level of education. Access, including viewing and uploading collections, is free. However, registration may be required for access to restricted collections with sensitive materials. Users who wish to add to DRI collections may do so following the six steps to deposit content. Guides, Training Series, and helpdesks are available for more in-depth questions. While the digital surrogates are stored with DRI, the original creator retain ownership, copyright, and associated intellectual property rights. Content will be returned to the creator should DRI cease to exist. Creators can always update their collections by adding new content or improving the metadata. Access restrictions can also be set by the creator.  Membership  Subscription based membership had been a goal since DRI's inception and was launched in February 2018. Institutions and organizations holding humanities and/or social sciences data, including those operating on a non-funded, voluntary basis, may apply for Full or Associate Membership to leverage DRI's digital stewardship experience and capabilities. Membership benefits also include a collaborative network, training and personal development, online publication and sharing of collections.

Posts also highlight stories from the collections and new additions. = Events = Through the DRI Events Calendar, users are invited to attend an array of events hosted by the DRI and its academic partners. Events include repository conferences, lectures and workshops on technical applications or trending library and archive topics. DRI also hosts seminars as part of the DRI Training Series to educate users on using the DRI platform as well as best practices for developing collections and using metadata. = Social Media = The DRI has several social media platforms for users to engage in. DRI joined Twitter in 2012 and actively updates its account along with the DRI Facebook page. Users can also access content such as community forums, presentations, and DRI Training Series via the DRI Vimeo page or the DRI Slideshare page.  Architecture and Structure  = Infrastructure = The platform was built from scratch using many open source platforms, utilizing the best of each and customizing them to implement DRI requirements without having to worry about sustaining and adapting legacy systems or methodologies. The implemented open source systems include OpenNebula, Fedora Commons, Samvera (formerly known as Hydra), Apache Solr, Blacklight, Shibboleth, Ceph, and Ansible. This new structure's framework was influenced by the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) reference model, while the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern implemented the data presentation and representation. The infrastructure has been replicated and is maintained at a secondary site in case of failure or disaster recovery. = Storage = DRI's digital asset preservation, storage, and access requires scalability as the repository's collections continue to grow. DRI utilizes technologies like Ceph and Bareos to provide federated storage and preservation while a separate process maintains integrity and fixity of archival data. The central management system governs storage, management, and migration. DRI's disaster management plan includes storage distribution across multiple servers in multiple geographic locations.

Treadway House is located in Bristol's Federal Hill neighborhood, long one of its most affluent residential areas. It stands at the southeast corner of Oakland Street and Grove Street, just south of the Federal Hill Historic District. It is a 2-1/2 story brick building, with a gambrel roof and a roughly L-shaped plan. The formal main facade faces west to Oakland Street, and is five bays wide, with a recessed center entrance. The entry recess is arched, and is framed by fluted wooden Corinthian pilasters and a fully pedimented gable. The interior of the recess is finished in wooden paneling, and there is a semi-oval transom above the door. A two-story service ell extends to the rear, its northern facade sheltered by a two-story porch with four Tuscan columns and a modillioned cornice. Both street-facing facades have gabled dormers with round-arch windows. The interior is finished with lavish carved woodwork and other original period features. The house was built in 1915 for Townsend G. Treadway, a descendant of clockmaker Eli Terry and a member of one of the city's most influential industrial families. The house was designed by the New York firm Murphy & Dana, whose commissions include a number of other high- profile designs in northwestern Connecticut. Treadway remained in the house until his death in 1972, after which it was sold out of the family. It was enlarged in 1936, to a design by Dana, in which the original single-story kitchen wing was raised to two stories, and the portico added.

She appeared internationally, mostly in concert, singing Lieder and oratorios. She is known for singing Lieder that Othmar Schoeck composed for her, and is regarded as one of the leading concert contraltos of her era. Life Born in Budapest on 13 May 1881, Durigo was a pupil of Bianca Malezcky and Julius Stockhausen. She studied from 1902 at the Vienna Conservatory with Philipp Forst√©n, then took further studies with Etelka Gerster and Eduard Bellwidt in Berlin. Each year from 1930 to 1939 she performed the alto part in Bach's St. Matthew Passion with the Concertgebouw Orchestra, conducted by Willem Mengelberg. This included the first recording of the work in 1939, alongside Karl Erb as the Evangelist and Willem RavelliWillem Ravelli on Discogs as the vox Christi. She performed as a soloist in more than 40 concerts with the choir Der Gemischte Chor Z√ºrich between 1911 and 1943. Singing also in musical centres of Austria, Germany, Belgium and Italy, she is regarded as one of the leading concert contraltos of the period. In 1912, Durigo first performed with Othmar Schoeck, and in 1913 she entered his social circle and they became friends. Durigo fell in love with Schoeck, but her feelings were not returned, and in any event she was by then married to the Hungarian pianist Osman Kasics. Her relationship with Schoeck was at times turbulent, but Durigo soon became the best-known interpreter of his work, and in later life he stated that she was the finest singer of his songs he had found.Othmar Schoeck: Life and Works; by Chris Walton ‚Äì University Rochester Press, 2009 ‚Äì (Eastman Studies in Music; Volume 65), , p. 48 Her many collaborations with Schoeck included his settings of poems by Hesse. The reviewer of her recital in Bern on 23 March 1915, with Schoeck as the pianist, in the Berner Tagblatt praised her differentiated expression of emotions and the accord with the pianist: Durigo was a voice teacher at the Zurich Conservatory from 1921 to 1937, where one of her students was Maria Stader. She was a friend of Hermann Hesse, the composer and conductor Fritz Brun, and the violinist Alphonse Brun. Durigo returned to Budapest in 1937 and taught at the Liszt Conservatory.
