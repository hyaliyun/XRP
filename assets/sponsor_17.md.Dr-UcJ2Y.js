Scarff scored ten goals in four league matches in early 1930, and by the end of the 1930–31 season, he had firmly established himself in the Celtic team, making 46 appearances as the club won the Glasgow Cup and the Scottish Cup and also generally improved their league form, finishing within two points of champions Rangers in contrast to the 15-point margin in his debut campaign two years earlier. He had made what proved to be his only appearance for Scotland in February 1931 but also experienced tragedy in September that year, being yards from the incident when teammate John Thomson died after receiving an accidental blow to the head during a match. Scarff never scored another goal after the Thomson incident and within months it was his health that was in serious doubt when he experienced difficulty breathing during matches and was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis. He played his 119th and last match for Celtic in December 1931, aged 23.Celtic player Scarffe, Peter, FitbaStats He soon relocated to a local sanatorium where it was hoped his condition might improve, but despite periods of remission it was confirmed by summer 1933 that he would never play football again; he died in December of that year.

Premise In April 2007, videos began appearing on YouTube under the username \\"retiredafb\\" claiming that Apollo 20, a secret lunar mission, found evidence of the existence of intelligent, alien life on the Moon. Then, on May 23, 2007, Italian ufologist Luca Scantanburlo interviewed a man who identified himself as William Rutledge, a retired American astronaut living in Rwanda. Rutledge claimed to be the commander of the Apollo 20 crew and to be the owner of the \\"retiredafb\\" account. However, Scantanburlo never met Rutledge in person because he conducted the interview over Yahoo! Messenger. Reconstruction of the American-Soviet flag as seen in the videos. During the interview, Rutledge claimed Apollo 20 was a top-secret mission launched in mid-August 1976 from Vandenberg Air Force Base in Lompoc, California, conducted jointly by the United States and the former Soviet Union. He alleged the other mission members were American Leona Snyder (an apparently fictitious person) and former Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov, the first human being to perform a spacewalk. The purported landing site of the mission was near Guyot crater, a feature near the much larger Delporte crater. Rutledge said the videos show that he and Leonov discovered the remains of an ancient lunar civilization. He also said they brought back artifacts to Earth for study, including a hibernating, female humanoid. The originator of the hoax was French videographer Thierry Speth. Factual basis Guyot Crater runs diagonally through the center of this photo taken by Apollo 16 astronauts in April 1972 while in lunar orbit. Some UFO enthusiasts believe the crater wall shows evidence of an alien spacecraft. Like many hoaxes, this story is a mixture of facts and fiction. The starting point for it are photos that NASA astronauts took in 1971 while in lunar orbit during the Apollo 15 mission, the fourth mission that landed men on the Moon. The photos show what look like a cigar-shaped object resting in a lunar crater. The hoaxer apparently used these photos to create the image of a pock-marked alien spacecraft on the Moon. The NASA photos are real. However, NASA never claimed they include images of alien spacecraft. The object in question is apparently nothing more than a natural part of the lunar terrain. Apollo 16 photos of the same crater taken a year later show no evidence of artificial structures. In truth, Apollo 20 was a mission that never flew. It was one of the three lunar missions NASA cancelled after Congress reduced its funding, including Apollo missions 18 and 19. The last crewed lunar mission was Apollo 17, launched in 1972. The next crewed mission that used an Apollo spacecraft was Skylab 2, launched on 25 May 1973, followed by Skylab 3 and Skylab 4 (Skylab 1 was an uncrewed mission that launched the Skylab space station into Earth orbit). The Skylab missions were followed by the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, coordinated by the United States and the former Soviet Union in 1975. Some of the stages for the Saturn V rockets intended for NASA's three cancelled lunar missions had already been constructed before their cancellation. According to the hoaxer's story, these were all used for the lunar landings of Apollo missions 18, 19, and 20. In reality, NASA used one of these to launch Skylab into orbit in 1973. The others are on display at three American space centers: the John F. Kennedy Space Center near Cape Canaveral, Florida; the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas; and the United States Space & Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama.

Bred in Kentucky, he was sold as a yearling and sent to Ireland to race for the Irish-based Coolmore Stud organisation. After winning both his races as a juvenile, he was initially disappointing in the early part of 2001 but then showed marked improvement to win the Irish 2000 Guineas and the St James's Palace Stakes. He was beaten in his last four races and was retired to stud at the end of the year. He has had success as a breeding stallion in the United States, New Zealand and South Africa. Background Black Minnaloushe is a bay horse bred in Kentucky by John R Gaines Thoroughbreds & William Condren. He was sired by Storm Cat, a high-class racehorse who won the Young America Stakes and finished second in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile in 1985. He went on to become an exceptionally successful breeding stallion, and was the Leading sire in North America in 1999 and 2000. The best of his progeny included Aljabr, Bluegrass Cat, Cat Thief, Forestry, Sophisticat, Giant's Causeway, Hold That Tiger, Jalil, Life Is Sweet, One Cool Cat, Storm Flag Flying and Tabasco Cat. Black Minnaloushe's dam Coral Dance was a successful racemare who finished second in the Prix Marcel Boussac. As a broodmare her other foals included Pennekamp and Nasr El Arab (Oak Tree Invitational Stakes, Carleton F. Burke Handicap, Strub Stakes, San Juan Capistrano Handicap). As a foal, Black Minnaloushe was sent to the Keeneland Sales in November 1998 and was bought for $750,000 by the bloodstock agent Dermot \\"Demi\\" O'Byrne, acting on behalf of the Coolmore Stud organisation. The colt was sent to Europe where he was trained by Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. Like many Coolmore horses, the details of Black Minnaloushe's ownership changed from race to race: he was listed a being owned by Susan Magnier in some races, whilst on other occasions he was described as the property of a partnership between Magnier and Michael Tabor. He was ridden in six of eleven races by Mick Kinane. The colt's name derives from W B Yeats' poem \\"The Cat and the Moon\\" from The Wild Swans at Coole. Racing career 2000: two-year-old season Black Minnaloushe began his racing career in a six furlong maiden race at Cork Racecourse on 7 August 2000. Starting the 4/6 favourite against five opponents, he took the lead just inside the final furlong and drew away in the closing stages to win by four lengths from the Dermot Weld-trained La Stellina. In September the colt was moved up in class and started favourite for the Listed Blenheim Stakes at the Curragh. He tracked the leaders before taking the lead a furlong and a half out and held off the late challenge of the British-trained Imperial Dancer to win by three quarters of a length. 2001: three-year-old season Black Minnaloushe made his three-year-old debut in the Listed Loughbrown Stakes at the Curragh on 21 April. Before the race O'Brien said \\"He has done exceptionally well and is a big horse this year. He can be a bit headstrong early in his races, but that's because he has a lot of natural speed\\". He started odds-on favourite but was beaten two lengths into second place by Lethal Agenda. Colm O'Donoghue took over from Kinane when the colt contested the Tetrarch Stakes at the same track two weeks later. Black Minnaloushe started poorly and finished last of the five runners behind his stablemate Modigliani with another O'Brien trainee, Mozart in third. Six days later, accompanied by Modigliani and King's County, the colt was part of O'Brien's entry for the Poule d'Essai des Poulains at Longchamp Racecourse in Paris. Ridden by Jamie Spencer, he raced at the rear of the eleven runner field before making progress in the straight and finished sixth, five lengths behind Noverre. The winner was subsequently disqualified after failing a dope test and the race was awarded to Vahorimix. On 26 May, Black Minnaloushe, ridden by Johnny Murtagh, was one of four O'Brien colts to contest the Irish 2000 Guineas at the Curragh and started a 20/1 outsider in a twelve-runner field. The Middle Park Stakes winner Minardi (ridden by Kinane) started favourite ahead of the 2000 Guineas runner-up Tamburlaine and the British-trained Mugharreb whilst the other contenders included Mozart and the highly rated maiden winner Freud. Black Minnaloushe raced in mid-division as Mozart led from the start and opened up a clear advantage, and moved up into third place approaching the final furlong. He caught Mozart well inside the final furlong and went on to win by two lengths, with Minardi taking third to complete a 1-2-3 for Ballydoyle. After the race Murtagh commented \\"There was a bit of a mix-up during the week about what I was going to ride and thankfully Aidan put me on Black Minnaloushe. It just goes to show that you need a little bit of luck in this game. [Aidan O'Brien] says he's a horse with lots of ability and sometimes he doesn't always put his best foot forward. Today the race was run to suit him, there was a good strong pace all the way and when the leader started to tire in front of him he got great heart in picking him up\\". Murtagh retained the ride when Black Minnaloushe was sent to England for the 156th running of the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot and started at odds of 8/1 in an eleven-runner field. Noverre started favourite ahead of Minardi, Dandoun (Heron Stakes) and Vahorimix, whilst the other runners were Olden Times (Prix Jean Prat), Tamburlaine, No Excuse Needed (Vintage Stakes), Keltos, the unbeaten Malhub and the Ballydoyle pacemaker Darwin. Murtagh tracked right at the start to settle Black Minnaloushe at the back of the field on the inside rail as Darwin set a strong pace. The colt moved into contention early in the straight before being switched to the left to make his challenge inside the final furlong. In a closely contested finish, he overtook Noverre in the final strides and won by a neck, with Olden Times a head away in third and Vahorimix a further half-length back in fourth. After the race Murtagh commented \\"When I switched him out, I knew he was going to win ... this was a top class race and a top class horse\\". He was also reported as saying \\"I picked him up in the Irish Guineas but everyone said that was a fluke. He's a very good horse, improving all the time\\". Eighteen days after his win at Ascot, Black Minnaloushe was matched against older horses for the first time and stepped up in distance for the Eclipse Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown. Ridden by Kinane, the colt started the 5/2 second favourite, but, after being restrained at the rear of the field, he never looked likely to win and finished fifth of the eight runners behind Medicean, Grandera, Bach and Tobougg. On 1 August, Black Minnaloushe was dropped back in distance and started 3/1 favourite for the Group One Sussex Stakes at Goodwood. After being held up in the early stages, he moved up to dispute the lead in the straight before finishing third behind Noverre and No Excuse Needed. Three weeks later Black Minnaloushe contested the International Stakes over ten furlongs at York Racecourse and finished fourth behind Sakhee, Grandera and Medicean. On his final appearance, Black Minnaloushe was sent to the United States for the Breeders' Cup Classic over ten furlongs on dirt at Belmont Park on 27 October. He was ridden by Murtagh, with Kinane being assigned the ride on the O'Brien stable's main hope Galileo. Starting a 51/1 outsider, he was always towards the rear of the field and finished tenth of the thirteen runners behind Tiznow. Stud record Black Minnaloushe was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion for the Coolmore Stud and stood at the Ashford Stud in Kentucky. He was shuttled to stand at the Windsor Park Stud in New Zealand for the Southern Hemisphere breeding season and made an immediate impact in Australasia. In June 2006 a majority interest in the stallion was sold to the Maine Chance Farm and he was exported to South Africa at the end of the year. His major winners have included Dancing in Silks (Breeder's Cup Sprint), Jokers Wild (Manawatu Sires Produce Stakes) Stream Cat (Arlington Handicap) and Black Mamba (John C. Mabee Handicap).

Built in 1831, this small wood frame building originally housed the offices of the Hussey Plow Company, now known as the Hussey Seating Company, a major manufacturer of bleachers and outdoor seating. The building, which now houses the company museum, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Description and history The Hussey Plow Company Building is located at the end of Dyer Street, one of the main access roads to the Hussey Seating factory on the southeast side of North Berwick's village center. It is a simple rectangular wood frame structure, with a front facing gable roof and clapboard siding. The front facade, facing south, has a double door set in a recessed opening on its right side. Although there are no windows on the front, each of the side and rear elevations has two windows. The building was built in 1831. The Hussey Seating Company's origins are in the development of a more efficient plow by William Hussey (1800–70) in the 1830s. His son Timothy established the T.B. Hussey Plow Company, which manufactured the metal parts for the plows in Newmarket, New Hampshire, and the wooden parts in North Berwick. Although plows were a major portion of its business throughout the 19th century, the company was by the start of the 20th century producing steel ladders and fire escapes, as well as metal parts for use in textile operations. In the 1930s the company developed wooden bleacher seat assemblies, which were refined in the 1950s to provide indoor rollout gymnasium seating that is now standard in many school facilities. This small building, originally used as an office, now houses a small museum.

At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Grabowski finished the Laser regatta steadily from a poor start to take the eleventh place overall with 125 points, trailing behind Spain's Luis Martínez by a five-point shortfall.

The project was announced in 2011 and construction commenced in 2012. As of September 2017 construction has only been partially completed despite $400 million having been spent and the project is at a standstill. Some reports says the project will never be completed. Details It will travel on a fully segregated, mostly elevated, right of way. The right of way will include two tracks, except for single- track sections at terminals and for one-directional loops. The initial route includes two segments - Phase 1A from Sharks Park to UTC Station, and Phase 1B further north to Waterlines. The overall distance from Sharks Park to Waterlines will be 5.4 km. Further extensions are in planning phases. It is planned to use Intamin People Mover P30 monorail trains, an electric driven train especially designed and most suitable for commuter services in cities. It is the most recent model of its kind and characterized by modern design, spacious cabins, and wide doors for easy access for passengers with luggage. The train runs on rubber wheels which are connected to bogies, and is laterally guided by means of side guiding wheels. The rubber-steel interface between train and guideway will have a good friction coefficient, leading to decreased vibration transmission to the train from the track. These attributes leads to higher ride quality and passenger comfort. One train will be in operation in Phase 1A, and six trains in Phase 1B. A train will consist of seven individual cars. Six cars will carry passengers, and the seventh car will house the motors and electrical equipment. Driver’s cabins will be situated at each end of the train. Passenger cars will feature safety and comfort systems. The air conditioning system is designed to provide a comfortable train interior, even if the outside temperature reaches . Each train will be able to accommodate 172 passengers, with provision for 44 seated passengers included. One end car will have access for wheelchairs, and all cabin floors will be the same height as the station platforms to provide easy access for passengers with reduced mobility. Provision will be made for hand- held luggage only. The design operating capacity for Phase 1A is 1,200 passengers per hour. With a maximum operating speed of 70km/h, the train will travel between end stations in about 8 minutes. Six trains will have a design operating capacity of 2,700 passengers per hour. Train travel time between end stations will be about 22 minutes. Passengers can expect a train to arrive every 8 minutes. History The decision to build the monorail was taken in 2009. In 2010, building of the project foundations began. The Government of Rivers State had in February 2013 announced that phase 1A and 1B of the monorail system would be completed during September that year. By 2014, monorail trains were performing test runs through UTC Station. In 2015, the LP gubernatorial candidate Tonye Princewill said he would cancel the system. However, he lost the election, receiving 0.86% of the vote. In 2015, newly elected Rivers State Governor Ezenwo Nyesom Wike announce that the project would be reviewed. In March 2016 it was reported the government had abandoned the project. In August 2016 it was reported the incomplete project had so far cost $400 million dollars and this compared unfavorably with the Moscow monorail that also used Intamin's design but had only cost $240 million dollars and was fully operational. In September 2017 it was reported the project is at a standstill. Another report says the project will never be completed.

Born in Zimbru, Arad County, her parents were Constantin Tălaș, a notary, deputy prefect and supporter of the 1848 revolutionaries in the Țara Zarandului area; and his wife Amalia. Her childhood was spent at Aciua, Hălmagiu and Baia de Criș; a graduate of the Romanian girls' school in Hălmagiu, she also took private lessons. Nevertheless, Hodoș, a precocious and voracious reader of literature, was largely self-taught. She married writer Alexandru I. Hodoș, but the union proved a failure, prompting her to move to Bucharest, capital of the Romanian Old Kingdom, in 1886. There, she undertook sustained publishing activity, penning articles on patriotic, social and cultural themes. She edited Revista noastră from 1905 to 1916, and also contributed to Adevărul literar și artistic, Dacia Traiană, Luceafărul, Lumea ilustrată, Minerva, Revista scriitoarei, Sămănătorul, Sibiul literar, Telegraful român, Transilvania, Universul, Vieața and Viața literară. Her writing debut came in Familia in 1891, under the pseudonym Th. Costan. Using the same name, she published her first volume, the novella Aur!, in 1893. Subsequently, she wrote the short prose volumes Spre fericire (1897), Frumos (1905), Departe de lume (1909) and Aci, pe pământ (1914), as well as the novel Martirii (1908). Her plays included Aur! (1903), Mântuirea (1920) and Judecătorul (1922); these were staged at the National Theatre Bucharest, as well as by amateur troupes in her native Transylvania. Hodoș also wrote plays and stories for children: Teatru de copii (1914), Rodica. În vârtejul războiului (1921) and Povestiri din viața copiilor (1928).

He was unseated in the 1999 primary election by fellow Democrat, later Republican, John Kennedy, now the state's junior U.S. senator. Biography Duncan was reared and educated in the public schools of Bossier City but later moved to Monroe, where he graduated in 1963 from Neville High School. Duncan received a Juris Doctorate from Louisiana State University Law Center in Baton Rouge and was admitted to the bar in 1971. He received a Master of Laws in taxation from Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, D.C.\\"Louisiana: Duncan, Ken\\", Who's Who in American Politics, 2003-2004, 19th ed., Vol. 1 (Alabama-Montana) (Marquis Who's Who: New Providence, New Jersey, 2003), p. 777 Since 1978, he has headed Duncan & Associates in Baton Rouge, a firm of law, business entrepreneurship, and public service. When he announced for treasurer, Duncan owned Savant Insurance Services. He is a co-founder of the Democratic Leadership Council, an organization originally associated with former U.S. President Bill Clinton. He promised if elected to act as the chief executive officer of the state and to stop fraud in the popular food stamp program.\\"Duncan runs for Louisiana State Treasurer\\", Minden Press-Herald, October 2, 1995, p. 1 In his initial election as treasurer to succeed Democrat Mary Landrieu, who ran unsuccessfully for governor of Louisiana in 1995, Duncan with 448,182 votes (34.9 percent) led a four candidate field of two Republicans, Mary Chehardy and Gayle Joseph, and his fellow Democrat Steve Theriot, who ran second with 372,500 votes (29 percent). Chehardy and Joseph finished with 335,463 (26.1 percent) and 128,272 (10 percent), respectively. In the second balloting, called the general election in Louisiana though both candidates were Democrats, Duncan defeated Theriot, a departing state representative from Jefferson Parish, 798,280 (56.7 percent) to 610,964 (43.4 percent). Duncan is a former chairman, general counsel, and executive director of the National Association of Democratic State Treasurers. In 1999, Duncan announced the establishment of the Louisiana State Investment Task Force composed of officials from the four largest state pension funds, state employees, teachers, other school employees, and Louisiana State Police, all based in Baton Rouge. The task force was charged with studying economically-targeted in-state investments. As treasurer, Duncan was also the chairman of the Louisiana Bond Commission, which reviews and approves all state and local issuances of bonds. Early in his tenure as treasurer, Duncan sought the refunding of as much as $610 million of state general obligation bonds that was expected to save the state $30 million. John Kennedy, no relations to the Kennedys of Massachusetts, unseated Duncan, 621,796 (55.6 percent) to 497,319 (44.4 percent). Kennedy remains the state treasurer and is expected to be a candidate for a fifth term in the nonpartisan blanket primary set for October 24, 2015. Duncan was a delegate to both the 1996 and the 2000 Democratic National Conventions, which confirmed the Clinton-Gore and Gore-Lieberman tickets.

The parameters, h and k are understood to be non-negative integers. The problem originated from a channel assignment problem in radio networks. The span of an L(h, k)-labelling, ρh,k(G) is the difference between the largest and the smallest assigned frequency. The goal of the L(h, k)-labelling problem is usually to find a labelling with minimum span.

Basel were the reigning Swiss Super League champions. They prepared their season with various warm-up matches against teams from Ukraine, Germany and Netherlands. Their 2015–16 Swiss Super League season began on 19 July with a home game against Vaduz. By the winter break, having won fourteen and drawing one of the first 18 games, Basel led the league table by 10 points ahead of the Grasshoppers and 15 ahead of the Young Boys. Basel were qualified for the 2015–16 Champions League in the Third qualifying round. The draw for the third qualifying round was held on 17 July 2015 and they were drawn against Lech Poznań. The first leg was played on 28 July in INEA Stadion, the return leg on 5 August 2015 in St. Jakob-Park. In the Play-off round, their opponents were Maccabi Tel Aviv, but Basel failed to qualify for the Champions League groups stage. Because Basel failed to qualify for the Champions League group stage, they dropped into the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League group stage, where were drawn into Group I alongside Fiorentina, Lech Poznań and Belenenses. Basel's first match was played away in Stadio Artemio Franchi in Florence on 17 September 2015. Because they finished as group winners, Basel continued in the knockout phase (which started in February 2016), playing an away game against Saint- Étienne. In the round of 16, Basel played Sevilla, losing 0–3 on aggregate. In the first round of the 2015–16 Swiss Cup, which was played on 15 August 2015, Basel were drawn away against Meyrin FC, winning 4–0. In the second round, played on 20 September 2015, Basel were drawn away against YF Juventus, winning 4–1. Then in the third round, played on 28 October, Basel were drawn away against SV Muttenz, winning 5–1. The fourth round was played on 13 December 2015, where Basel lost away at the Stade Tourbillon against Sion after a penalty shootout.  Club   Management  Paulo Sousa quit his Trainer position in Basel at the end of the 2014–15 season. On 18 June 2015, Basel announced that Urs Fischer had signed a three-year contract as first team manager. His assistants are Marco Walker and Markus Hoffmann. Massimo Colomba remained the Goalkeeper coach. Massimo Ceccaroni is head of the FCB Youth System. Coach of the Youth Team (U–21) was Thomas Häberli until October, at which time, due to the bad results, he had to step back and then Ceccaronii coached the team.  Further information  The FC Basel AGM took place on 27 April 2015 in Basel's congress center. The board of directors under president Bernhard Heusler with vice-president Adrian Knup, sport director Georg Heitz, financial manager Stephan Werthmüller and marketing manager René Kamm, and the three directors Reto Baumgartner, Dominik Donzé and Benno Kaiser were all willing to continue and they were all re-elected unanimously. Overview Off-season and pre-season At the end of the 2014–15 FC Basel season four first team players left the club to continue their careers elsewhere. These were Fabian Schär to 1899 Hoffenheim, Fabian Frei to Mainz 05, Giovanni Sio to Rennes and Arlind Ajeti. Also no longer in the team for this season was Marco Streller, who retired from professional football. As mentioned above Urs Fischer was the new first team manager. Basel's biggest signings for the beginning of the new season were Daniel Høegh from Odense, Zdravko Kuzmanović from Internazionale, Michael Lang from Grasshopper and Marc Janko, who came in on a free transfer from Sydney FC. Also new to the team are Manuel Akanji, who transferred in from FC Winterthur, and Mirko Salvi, who returned from his one-year loan to FC Biel-Bienne. Because Streller retired, Matías Delgado was named as captain; Marek Suchý and Kuzmanović were named as his vice-captains. Mid-season break During the winter break, there were a number of changes to the Basel squad. Ivan Ivanov, who spent the last two years recovering from an injury, left the club by mutual consent. Also outwards were Zdravko Kuzmanović, on loan to Udinese and Albian Ajeti, who never quite managed to enter into the first team; he transferred to FC Augsburg. Also Yoichiro Kakitani, who only played a minor role in manager Fischer's team, transferred back to Japan to rejoin Cerezo Osaka. However, the one transfer deal that made the most news was midfielder Mohamed Elneny's departure to English Premier League side Arsenal. There were also a few players on the inwards direction. As early as 8 December 2015, the club announced that Andraž Šporar had signed a four-and-a-half-year contract up until the end of June 2020. Then, on 2 January 2016, the club announced it had signed Alexander Fransson, also on a four-and-a-half-year contract. Again, on 12 January, they announced that Renato Steffen had also joined them on yet another four-and-a-half-year deal. 2016–17 off-season On 4 May, Basel announced that they had signed 18-year-old Paraguayan defender Blás Riveros on a five-year deal. Due to Riveros' commitments with the Paraguay national team at the upcoming Copa América Centenario, he will not be expected to join the Basel first team until the beginning of July. On 10 May, Basel also announced that they had signed Egyptian defender Omar Gaber from Zamalek on a four-year deal. The campaign = Super League = Basel's priority aim for the season is to win the league championship for the seventh time in a row. Basel's 2015–16 Swiss Super League season began well with a home victory on 18 July against Vaduz. In fact, they started the season very well, winning each of their first eight games, scoring 22 goals conceding 7. They suffered their first defeat in the Stade de Suisse 3–4 against Young Boys. Four of the next five games were won; the away game against Zürich in Letzigrund ended in a 2–2 draw. Two defeats were followed by two victories. By the winter break, Basel led the league table with 43 points, 10 points ahead of the Grasshoppers and 15 ahead of the Young Boys. They had won 14 and drawing 1 of the first 18 games, scoring 43 goals and conceding just 20. Basel started the second half of the season with three straight wins, a further 2–2 draw against Zürich and another three straight wins. In round 31, on 30 April, the home win against Sion gave Basel a 16-point lead in the league table with just five games left to play and thus the championship title. Basel ended the season with two defeats in the last three games, but won the championship with 83 points and were 14 points ahead of Young Boys and 29 points ahead of Luzern. Basel had won 26 games drawing five and had suffered five defeats; they had scored 88 goals, conceding 38. = Swiss Cup = Basel's clear aim for the 2015–16 Swiss Cup is to regain the title that they last won four seasons ago. In the previous three seasons they had ended the cup competitions as runners-up, in 2013 against Grasshopper Club Zürich, in 2014 against Zürich and the previous season 2015 against Sion. In the first round of this season's competition, which was played on 15 August 2015, Basel are drawn away against Meyrin FC, winning 4–0. In the second round, Basel were drawn away against YF Juventus, which was played on 20 September. Because of safety reasons, however, the game was not played at YF Juventus' home ground, the Utogrund, but instead at St. Jakob-Park. Then in the third round, played on 28 October, Basel were drawn away against SV Muttenz, marking the first time that these two teams played against each other. The game was played at the Sportplatz Margelacker with a stadium record crowd of 5,800. The match was a 5–1 win for Basel. The fourth round was played on 13 December 2015 away in the Stade Tourbillon against Sion, where Basel lost after a penalty shootout. = Champions League = Basel entered into this season's Champions League in the Third qualifying round. Their initial aim was to remain in the competition and reach the group stage. The draw for the third qualifying round was held on 17 July 2015 and they were drawn against Lech Poznań and in the play-off round against Maccabi Tel Aviv. ;Lech Poznań (29 July 2015) The first leg was played in INEA Stadion. Basel took the lead as Michael Lang, in the 24th minute, scored after a corner taken by Luca Zuffi. Just two minutes later, however, Lech Poznań equalized through Denis Thomalla. Although Shkëlzen Gashi missed a penalty in the 67th minute, Marc Janko (77th minute) and Davide Callà (92nd minute) completed the 3–1 away win. ;Lech Poznań (5 August 2015) The return leg at St. Jakob-Park ended in a home victory for Basel. Birkir Bjarnason scored his first goal for his new club in injury time to give Basel a 1–0 win. ;Maccabi Tel Aviv (19 August 2015) The first leg was played in Basel. Eran Zahavi put Maccabi in the lead with their first chance, in the 31st minute. Basel were awarded a penalty in the 39th minute which captain Matías Delgado netted to equalize. Breel Embolo scored in the 88th minute to give Basel a 2–1 lead, but Zahavi equalised six minutes into added time for Maccabi as the match ended 2–2. ;Maccabi Tel Aviv (19 August 2015) The return game had a sold out Bloomfield Stadium crowd of 13,350. Luca Zuffi gave the visitors an early lead with a free-kick in the 11th minute. Eran Zahavi's seventh goal of this season's competition levels the score in the 24th minute. Maccabi reached the Champions League group stage for the first time in a decade, progressed on the away goals rule. = Europa League = Because Basel failed to qualify for the Champions League group stage, they dropped into the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League group stage. The draw was held on 28 August 2015, 13:00 CEST, at the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco and Basel were drawn into Group I, together with Fiorentina, Lech Poznań and Belenenses. ;Fiorentina (17 September 2015) Basel's first match was played away at the Stadio Artemio Franchi in Florence. Fiorentina's new first team manager was Basel's ex-manager, Paulo Sousa. Nikola Kalinić scored a fourth-minute opener for Fiorentina and they held the lead until well into the second half of the game. Fiorentina captain Gonzalo Rodríguez was sent off after 66 minutes and following his dismissal the Swiss club took charge and managed to draw level. Birkir Bjarnason beat Luigi Sepe with a low drive from the edge of the area on 71 minutes. Eight minutes later, Mohamed Elneny capped the fightback in style. His super-rising drive from outside the box completed the comeback success. With this 2–1 win, Basel extended their unbeaten run to five matches in Europe this term. ;Lech Poznań (1 October 2015) The first home game in the Europa League group stage was against Lech Poznań, who had been opponents in the Champions League qualifying earlier in the season. Lech's Swiss midfielder Darko Jevtić was signed from Basel after a successful loan spell. The 22-year-old was born in Basel and came through the youth ranks at the Swiss club. The first half passed without much action, but the home team dominated. Icelandic midfielder Birkir Bjarnason brought a long ball down with his chest at the edge of the penalty area, kept his balance under pressure, and then turned a finish past Maciej Gostomski to give the hosts the lead after 55 minutes. In the 90th minute, Luca Zuffi made a cross from the right, Marc Janko controlled with his chest and laid off for the waiting Breel Embolo, who finished with a powerful low volley. The final score 2–0 was a deserved result. ;Belenenses (22 October 2015) The third game in the group stage was the home match against Belenenses. Basel took an early lead after 15 minutes, Matías Delgado kicked an inswinging corner to the back post from the left and Michael Lang jumped highest to power his header into the goal from five metres. Belenenses leveled after 27 minutes with their first chance. A long ball forward was headed clear by Marek Suchý, but it dropped to Luís Leal, who was 25 metres from goal. He hammered a low volley into the bottom corner and the ball bounced to evade the dive of Germano Vailati. During the extra time of the first half, Leal ran clear on the right flank, rushed into the area, playing the ball across the face of goal to Kuca Miranda who had easyest of finishes, tapping in from just three metres. During the second half, Basel played forward non-stop but were unable to score the equalizer. Until this 1–2 defeat, Basel had been unbeaten this season, in the domestic league (nine games) and in Europe (six). ;Belenenses (5 November 2015) The return game against Belenenses was played in Estádio do Restelo two weeks after the home game. Basel took early command, a first chance from Breel Embolo hit the post after nine minutes, and Basel continued to dominate their opponents entirely. But it was not until very nearly half time that their efforts were rewarded. In the 44 minute, Embolo was fouled in the penalty area by Filipe Ferreira, and Marc Janko scored from the spot. Embolo himself scored the second goal after being played free by Luca Zuffi's long deep pass into the penalty box which was flicked on by Janko. With this 2–0 victory, Basel avenged their matchday three loss. ;Fiorentina (26 November 2015) Basel's third and last home match in the Europa League group stage was the return game against Fiorentina. Paulo Sousa returned to St. Jakob-Park, but this time to the visitors' bench. Basel's first choice goalkeeper Tomáš Vaclík injured himself shortly before kick-off and was replaced by Germano Vailati. Federico Bernardeschi ended his personal run of 11 games without a goal with a first-half double (23 and 36 minutes) to give Fiorentina a two- goal lead. After 26 minutes, Facundo Roncaglia was punished with a red card after elbowing Breel Embolo in the face. Basel fought back into the game, with Marek Suchý cutting the gap before half-time (40th minute) and Mohamed Elneny equalizing on 74 minutes. The game ended in a 2–2 and Basel advance as Group I winners after recovering from being two down. ;Lech Poznań (10 December 2015) As written above, Basel were certain to finish top of the section before matchday six. For the last match in the group stage Basel had to travel to the INEA Stadion in Poznań. Lech Poznań had already lost to Basel three times this season and only a win would have given them any chance of making it through Group I. Unable to play were defenders Manuel Akanji, Philipp Degen and Daniel Høegh (all due to injury), as well as Marek Suchý, who was out suspended. Walter Samuel made his 100th UEFA club competition appearance playing this match. Reserve goalkeeper Germano Vailati was again Basel's starter because of first choice goalkeeper Tomáš Vaclík's injury. In the 44th minute, Vailati himself also suffered an injury as he played a long pass forward. Just before half-time, third-choice goalkeeper Mirko Salvi was introduced and made his professional debut for the club. Adonis Ajeti also made his debut for the club after coming on as a substitute at half-time in place of Michael Lang.Lech Poznań vs. Basel - 10 December 2015 - Soccerway Jean-Paul Boëtius scored the only goal five minutes after half-time, it was his first goal for the Swiss champions. Because Basel ended this stage as group winners, they continued (seeded in the draw) in the knockout phase, which started in February 2016. The draw for the round of 32 was held on 14 December 2015, where Basel were drawn against French side Saint-Étienne. The first leg was played on 18 February at 19:00 and the return leg in the St. Jakob-Park played on 25 February 2016 at 21:05. ;Saint-Étienne (18 February 2016) The first leg of the round of 32 was played in the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, but without Basel supporters due to the high security alert following the terror attacks in Paris two months earlier. Basel came back from 2–0 down but ended up losing. Moustapha Sall in the fifth minute and Kévin Monnet-Paquet in the 39th minute put the hosts 2–0 in the lead. Then Walter Samuel started Basel's fight-back just before half-time in the 44th minute, becoming the second-oldest scorer in the UEFA Europa League at age 37 years and 332 days; he is surpassed only by Molde FK's Daniel Hestad, who scored at age 40 years and 98 days in this season's group stage. Marc Janko, via a penalty in the 56th minute, put Basel level and the guests pressed for their third goal. After a long clearance, however, defender Jean-Christophe Bahebeck scored for the hosts in the 79th against the run of play, and the final score ended 3–2 in favour of Saint- Étienne. ;Saint-Étienne (25 February 2016) The return game against was played a week later and Basel had to win to qualify for the next round. This was very apparent as Basel played forwards immediately and levelled the aggregate as midfielder Luca Zuffi curled in a 25-yard free-kick on 15 minutes. Saint- Étienne went close, but goalkeeper Tomáš Vaclík saved the shot from substitute Romain Hamouma. Both teams were later reduced to ten men: In the 82nd minute, Saint-Étienne midfielder Valentin Eysseric collected two quick yellow cards for a foul and then a clash with Renato Steffen, while Basel's 19-year-old attacker Breel Embolo followed him off the pitch for a second caution. Saint- Étienne thought they had won it when captain Moustapha Sall netted from close range with just one minute of regular time left, only for Zuffi to crash the ball home in added time to level the tie at 4–4 and send Basel through on away goals. ;Sevilla (10 March 2016) The first leg of the round of 16 was played in the Basel and Sevilla had not won a European away game all season, so the goalless draw in Switzerland represented an improvement. Three second-half saves from Basel goalkeeper Tomáš Vaclík kept the home team in contention, but reigning Europa League title holders Sevilla cannot be unhappy with a goalless draw in this first leg. Marc Janko jumped high to head Basel's first chance just a little bit wide as early as the seventh minute – easily Basel's best chance of the first half – with Sevilla dominating possession thereafter. Steven Nzonzi went quite close with headers at either end of the period, while Éver Banega twice found Coke with free-kicks but the Sevilla captain was unable to find the target from either position. Basel's resolve returned after the half time break, if not their composure, Birkir Bjarnason blazing off target from a loose ball after a Renato Steffen shot was blocked. The Icelandic midfielder then pulled a decent ball across from the right, only for substitute Adama Traoré to scuff his attempted conversion. However, it could have been worse for the Swiss team but for Vaclík, who was very awake and saved with his feet after Nzonzi was played in and then kept out Kevin Gameiro's low drive, going to ground once more to repel Yevhen Konoplyanka as time ticked down. Midfielder Nzonzi's dismissal near the end of the game offered Basel hope, but Sevilla held firm. ;Sevilla (17 March 2016) The return game against was played a week later on 17 March 2016 at the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium. Defender Adil Rami opened the scoring as he stooped to head a José Antonio Reyes corner in off the post. The match then slipped out of Basel's reach inside two minutes at the end of the first half. Reyes danced through the Basel defence and his low cross gave Kevin Gameiro an easy finish from close range. A minute later, Michael Krohn-Dehli advanced with a quick run and was the provider of the cross that found Gameiro. The striker's header came back off the underside of the crossbar and bounced in off his leg to make it 3–0 at half-time. Basel showed only small signs of a fightback. Luca Zuffi's effort from 25 yards out was still rising as it flew over the crossbar. Breel Embolo missed two chances late in the game as the Swiss side were dumped out of the competition. The result extended Sevilla's run of Europa League home wins to 11 – the longest in the competition's history and put a dent in Basel's impressive away record in Europe this season.

It was destroyed early in the event. Design and development After the publication in April 1912 of the rules for the Circuit of Anjou time trial, to be held as part of the Grand Prix d'Aviation de l'Aéro-club de France contest in mid-June that year, the Caudron brothers began the design of a competitor that could carry four or five passengers. The emphasis on passenger carrying capacity was determined by the rules: for each passenger weighing over , the flight time for the required seven circuits of the course would be reduced by . With five passengers competition times would be more than halved to 40% of the flight times. More weight required more power and the rules limited the engine displacement to . Early Caudron aircraft, like the Type A had used Anzani engines, and a new , 14-cylinder Anzani radial engine, essentially two Anzani seven cylinder engines slightly displaced on a common crankshaft, was chosen. The passenger load required the Multiplace to have a larger wing area than any of their earlier aircraft, though the wing maintained the general features established previously. Both the upper and lower wings had the same plan, rectangular apart from their tips, though the upper span was 27% greater than the lower. They were fabric covered and built around twin spars, both of which were ahead of mid-chord, leaving most of the length of each rib unsupported and free to warp for roll control. Because of the large span they were three bay wings, the bays separated by three pairs of parallel, vertical interplane struts; there was no stagger. On each wing another pair of parallel masts leaned outwards from the bases of the outer interplane struts to support the overhang of the upper wing and at the wing roots two more pairs of vertical interplane struts supported both the wing centre section and, just above the lower wing, the fuselage, an arrangement also used to support the short nacelle of the Type B. Instead of the nacelle and the twin booms that supported the empennage on the Type B, the Multiplace had a rectangular section, full length fuselage with the engine in the nose, built around four longerons and fabric covered. There was a long, open cockpit for passengers and pilot, the latter sitting at the back under a little cut-out in the wing trailing edge for better upward vision. The single, roughly rectangular rudder was entirely above the fuselage and was cut away on its underside to allow the deflection of the horizontal tail's trailing edge. The tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage. The Multiplace had two pairs of mainwheels; each pair was mounted on a long skid with an upturned nose which extended beyond the wing both forward and aft. These held the aircraft close to a take-off attitude on the ground and in this way replaced the lower members of the tailbooms used on other Caudron types of the time. The rear fuselage was protected though by a very tall tailskid. The underwingskids were placed on longitudinally splayed extensions of the inner interplane struts and transversely braced by pairs of lighter struts to the bases of the centre section struts. The Multiplace was completed only a few days before the competition began, leaving little time for testing. It flew to Anjou with four passengers. Bad weather on the first day made the intended programme impossible but the next day (17 June) was somewhat better and the organisers improvised a one-day event. René Caudron decided to take part, though only carrying three passengers in the Multiplace to reduce risks. Flown by Allard and with the engine running roughly, the aircraft climbed to perhaps before, as an onlooker described, \\"rearing up\\" (se cobra), turning rapidly, catching a wingtip on the ground and nosediving in. Three of the occupants escaped without major injury but one, a Caudron mechanic, broke a leg. The Multiplace was not rebuilt and Caudron did not use the fourteen cylinder Anzani engine again, though they frequently used other models.

She is an internationally noted authority on psychoanalysis and the arts.“Prepared introduction by Peter Loewenberg to invited lecture by EHS at the International Psychoanalytic Association Congress, Boston, 7-24, 2015\\"” Books Drawing on her early experience as an artist, Ellen Handler Spitz then went on to establish her writing career by exploring the arts psychologically and by examining their relationship to childhood. Her work ranges topically from painting and sculpture to observations on ancient Greek drama and children's literature, but it always concerns the triumvirate of art, psychology, and childhood. Art and Psyche Spitz's closely argued book, Art and Psyche, explores the relations between art and mind by using psychoanalytic thought. It uniquely demonstrates how three major models follow the history of ideas --- in art and literary criticism, in philosophical aesthetics, and in the development of psychoanalytic theory. Spitz's models are: the relations between an artist's life and work, the work of art itself, and the relations between a work of art and its audience or beholders. To illustrate her theoretical discussion, Spitz draws on a wide variety of art forms, including painting, sculpture, literature, music, and dance. Art and Psyche is read on college campuses both in the US and abroad and has been translated into Italian, Chinese, and Serbian.“UMETNOST I PSIHA”, clio.rs; accessed 7 August 2015. Image and Insight Image and Insight examines the strenuous paradox of looking within and outward at the same time. Spitz's metaphor for this project is Teiresias, the blind seer of ancient Greece, and she works psychologically with a wide swath of subjects including 1970s NYC subway car graffiti, a 1987 exhibition of African sculpture, a composition of postmodern music, and paintings by a schizophrenic child, among others. Museums of the Mind Museums of the Mind begins with a psychologically inflected, thematic study of selected paintings by the distinguished Belgian Surrealist René Magritte, in which Spitz traces the effects of the artist's mother's suicide by drowning when he was a boy. Noted art critic Donald Kuspit writes \\"This section on Magritte is perhaps the definitive analysis of his art.\\"Spitz, Ellen, Museums of the Mind, Yale University Press, 1994, back cover. Spitz's work on Magritte is the only extant book-length study of the artist from a psychoanalytic perspective, and it was reissued in 2014 as an eBook under the title Magritte's Labyrinth.\\"Magritte's Labyrinth\\", itunes.apple.com; accessed 19 October 2015 Inside Picture Books Inside Picture Books poses the question as to why stories and images shown to us as children linger in our minds. How is it that some children's books survive while others fade? Using her psychological acumen, Spitz reveals how classic children's books transmit wisdom, shape tastes, implant subtle biases, and stimulate moral reflection. She advocates for conversational reading between adults and children and addresses powerful topics such as curiosity, identity and self-acceptance, separation and loss, as well as disobedience. Inside Picture Books exemplifies Dr. Spitz’ interdisciplinary academic approach, which can pose challenges to conventional researchers. For instance, in Children's Literature (journal), Philip Nel evaluates the book the from the perspective of a narrowly-focused historian of children’s literature. https://muse.jhu.edu/article/251738 On the other hand, Inside Picture Books has been acclaimed as a classic among scholars of its intended genre of interpretive psychology, being praised by such innovative and widely acclaimed notables as Quentin Blake, Marina Warner, Judith Wallerstein, Pat Schroeder, Maria Tatar, and Pamela Paul. The Brightening Glance In The Brightening Glance, Spitz asks how the imagination emerges and develops in young children. She shows how a child's gaze magnifies the sensory and perceptual world and how children make no hard distinctions between art and nature, reality and make-believe. Aesthetic and psychological growth intersect, she reveals, and she shows how, by observing what holds a child's attention, we can promote growth and also rediscover our own worlds through freshly reawakened eyes.

Eleuterio (born November 23, 1927) is an American industrial chemist noted for technical contributions to catalysis, polymerization, industrial research management, and science education. In particular, he discovered the olefin metathesis reaction and several novel fluoropolymers. Additionally, he explored techniques for research leadership, especially methods for fostering collaboration, globalization, and scientific creativity. Eleuterio's discovery of olefin metathesis is cited as a compelling example of a scientific development originating in industry, subsequently being nurtured by academia, and returning to industry in commercially viable form.  Early life and education  Eleuterio was born in New Bedford, Massachusetts, to parents of Portuguese descent. He completed a B.S. in Chemistry at Tufts University in 1949. He continued on to graduate school at Michigan State University, pursuing physical organic chemistry. As part of his thesis research with his Ph.D. advisor Harold Hart, Eleuterio conducted fundamental mechanistic studies on important organic reactions such as nucleophilic aromatic substitution. While in graduate school, he married the future Marianne Eleuterio (née Kingsbury) who later became a genetics professor at West Chester University. After completing his doctoral thesis in 1953, Eleuterio pursued post-doctoral research in synthetic organic chemistry at the Ohio State University, working in the laboratories of Melvin S. Newman. He subsequently joined the research staff at the DuPont Co.'s Experimental Station in 1954.  Industrial career  Working in the Petrochemicals Department of the DuPont Co. in 1957, Eleuterio discovered that certain catalysts convert propylene to a mixture containing ethylene and butene, a reaction he recognized as olefin metathesis. In follow-up experimentation, Eleuterio demonstrated that cyclic olefins such as norbornene and cyclopentene could be polymerized to linear polymer, a reaction since dubbed ring-opening metathesis polymerization, as claimed in a patent first filed in 1957.Herbert Sousa Eleuterio, US Patent 3074918 (1963), assigned to DuPont. Eleuterio's discovery resulted from a fundamental investigation of propylene polymerization using a molybdena-on-alumina catalyst modified with metal hydrides. This experimental designed yielded an ethylene-propylene co-polymer together with ethylene and butene by-products rather than the expected polypropylene. He then extended his experimentation to internal olefins and cyclic olefins, substances that are not normally polymerized by could serve as olefin metathesis substrates. Many researchers followed on Eleuterio's initial discovery, culminating in the 2005 Nobel Prize to Chauvin, Grubbs, and Schrock for the development of olefin metathesis for organic synthesis.\\"The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2005\\". Nobelprize.org. Nobel Media AB 2014. Web. 22 Jul 2015. Nobel Laureates Grubbs and Schrock honored Eleuterio for his discovery of olefin metathesis. Eleuterio subsequently worked on preparation of novel fluoropolymers. He discovered that hexafluoropropylene could be co-polymerized with tetrafluoroethylene to yield amorphous fluorinated ethylene propylene co- polymers with good characteristics as films. These are a class of fluoropolymers today known generically as FEP, and Eleuterio's findings were on co-polymers that contained 50 to 100% hexafluoropropylene.Herbert Sousa Eleuterio, US Patent 3062792 (1962), assigned to DuPont. Eleuterio also worked on epoxidation of hexafluoropropylene, finding a practical synthesis of hexafluoropropylene oxide using hydrogen peroxide anion. He carried out pioneering research on oligomerization of hexafluoropropylene oxide to make fluorinated lubricating oils.E.P. Moore, Jr., A.S. Milian, Jr., H.S. Eleuterio, US 3250808 (1966), assigned to DuPont. These findings ultimately proved important in the development of fluorinated ionomers such as Nafion. Beginning in 1959, Eleuterio held a series of management posts, mostly in research management. Managerial positions he held were related to polymer intermediates, explosives, atomic energy and long-range research. From 1985 to 1989, Eleuterio was the Technical Director of the U.S. Government's Savannah River atomic energy facility in Aiken, South Carolina, which was managed by the DuPont Co. under government contract. During this period, Eleuterio was instrumental in the founding of the Ruth Patrick Science Education Center. He also served on the Council for Chemical Research, which he chaired in 1990.  Academic career  Following his 1992 retirement from the DuPont Co., Eleuterio became a visiting professor at the National University of Singapore, teaching part-time. At the university, he continued to pursue his interests in globalization of R&D; and the fundamental nature of the creative process as it relates to science and technology. He taught courses on managing research and development, typically with master's degree students in engineering, science, and business. He founded the Process Analysis and Optimization Enterprise, which was the forerunner of the university's Center for Process Engineering. Eleuterio currently resides in Wilmington, Delaware.

The monkey is named after Brazilian zoologist Paulo Vanzolini. This species was originally described by Hershkovitz as the subspecies Pithecia irrorata vanzolinii based on individuals collected in 1936 by Alfonso M. Olalla, but it was raised to full species status in 2014. For many years, there had been no record of the species in nature. Further specimens were collected in 1956 by Fernando Novaes (the then director of the Goeldi Museum in Pará) and his assistant Miguel Moreira. The mammals in this expedition were collected alive and prepared as museum specimens, as described by Cory T. Carvalho, the mammalogist working at the Goeldi museum at the time. After 61 years, in 2017, one individual was collected after being hunted for bush meat in an extractive community in the state of Acre, Brazil. After not being seen alive for more than 60 years, as F. Novaes and M. Moreira collected specimens in 1956, an individual was photographed in the wild in August 2017. In January-February 2017, an expedition surveyed for large mammals, with a focus on primates, along the Eiru River and Igarapé Preto in Amazonas. P. vanzolinii was found on both sides of the Eiru River, from the mouth of the Juruá River upriver to the Terrra Indigena Rio Eiru. In total 21 sightings of 12 groups, with 2-5 individuals per group, and a total of 34 individuals, were made. One voucher specimen was collected of an adult male, which is held in the mammal collection at Mamirauá Institute for Sustainable Development.

The school currently enrolls students in pre- kindergarten through 8th grade. It is affiliated with the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington and the Mother of God Community, which was responsible for the school's founding. It is located across the street from the St. John Neumann Roman Catholic Church, but is not officially connected to the parish. The school recently celebrated its 30th anniversary. Background Mother of God School was founded in 1987 to help meet the needs of parents with young children in the Mother of God Community. The Community is a group of primarily Catholic laypeople living in Montgomery County, Maryland who have made a commitment to help one another live as intentional disciples of Christ and thus the School also tries to promote a Catholic and Christ-life awareness among in its students and faculty. The current principal is also its President, W. Hall Miller. In the mid 1980s, the Community experienced an influx of younger families who needed to enroll their children in local schools.. To help meet these needs, Community members voted to purchase a piece of land along Goshen Road and construct a school. The three- story brick building was built which was joined to a white brick building called \\"Goshen House\\" which houses a sizable chapel and living areas for some members of the community. In 1994, the school's second major construction project was completed: a brick building housing a large gym and several classrooms. The gym is used as a sports facility, a cafeteria, a place to hold school plays, a conference and meeting facility, and a place to hold Mass and other prayer services. The buildings face a central courtyard housing a statue of the Virgin Mary which would later be used in the school's annual May Crowning, one of many traditions shared by both the school and community. The students of the school spent two years in an unused public school building nearby before the construction of the Goshen Road campus was completed. After review of the school, the Archdiocese of Washington determined Mother of God met the diocese's \\"Policies for Catholic Schools\\" and accepted it as an affiliated Catholic school. In 1999, the school was first accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. It is currently accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.. After graduation Mother of God School students have been accepted into magnet programs at surrounding public high schools as well as at many local private high schools including Our Lady of Good Counsel, St. John’s Catholic Prep, Connelly School of the Holy Child, Georgetown Prep, Oakcrest and the Academy of the Holy Cross. Graduates have often been awarded scholarships for merit in academics, music and art. The school currently has around 200 students but can easily accommodate some 250 students. The School has a Pre-Kindergarten program for three, four, and five year old children. For other grades the core curriculum includes Religion, Language Arts, Mathematics, Social Studies and Science. In addition students in grades K-8 also benefit from classes in art, music, foreign language, physical education, library, and computer science. Student Clubs and Activities Mother of God has a number of clubs, including Boy Scouts chapters; a Robotics Club; and a Mathcounts club which has consistently achieved Silver and Gold Level status. The school has a history of Mathcounts competitors who have done well in local competitions, including some who have progressed to the state level. The School also has a Drama Club with annual productions, and a concert band and string ensemble that have bi-annual concerts. The school's \\"Band\\" teachers and conductors are members of the Washington Archdiocesan Music Teachers' Council, which provides music lessons and extracurricular band experiences for Catholic schools in the Archdiocese of Washington. Athletics The school's athletic programs currently consists of CYO basketball teams. Cross Country and Soccer teams have been added recently. Traditions GlobalFest Logo The School has developed certain fundraising and other traditions including its \\"Race for Education\\" and GlobalFest traditions. The first encourages students to obtain sponsors for certain running events and the other is an annual multicultural event with selective ethnic foods, related student stage performances, and a silent auction. Globalfest Mother of God School's Globalfest is its biggest annual event. It is frequently attended by large numbers of people from around the county, and is advertised in local newspapers and radio broadcasts. In the fall, the kindergarten through eighth grades are assigned Regional performances from around the globe (the preschool classes are given a state within the U.S.). As spring approaches, classes will begin to make posters and art to display in their homerooms; they will also start practicing a traditional skit, song, or dance from their assigned region. Parents provide traditional food and music on the day of the event, and each class performs. Attendees bid in a silent auction; purchase food and trinkets.

He is regarded as a \\"founding father of North Korean poetry\\" whose distinct Soviet-influenced style of lyrical epic poetry in the socialist realist genre became an important feature of North Korean literature. He was nicknamed \\"Korea's Mayakovsky\\" after the writer whose works had had an influence on him and which implied his breaking from the literature of the old society and his commitment to communist values. Since a remark made by Kim Jong-il on his 2001 visit to Russia, North Korean media has referred to Cho as the \\"Pushkin of Korea\\". Cho was dispatched by the Soviet authorities to liberated Korea when the Red Army entered in 1945. By that time, he had substantial experience with Soviet literature and literature administration. The Soviets hoped that Cho would shape the cultural institutions of the new state based on the Soviet model. For the Soviets, the move was successful and Cho did not only that but also significantly developed socialist realism as it would become the driving force of North Korean literature and arts. Cho offered some of the earliest contributions to Kim Il-sung's cult of personality. His most famous work is Mt. Paektu (1947), a lyrical epic praising Kim Il-sung's guerrilla activities and promoting him as a suitable leader for the new North Korean state. Other notable works by Cho include , a seemingly non-political love poem which was later adapted as a popular song that is known in both North and South Korea. During the Korean War, Cho wrote wartime propaganda poems. He died during the war in an American bombing raid. He and his works are still renowned in North Korean society. Life and career Cho Ki-chon was born to poor Korean peasants in the village of Ael'tugeu in the Vladivostok District of the Russian Far East on 6 November 1913. The Pacific region of the Soviet Union, where he lived, was a center for Korean independence activists. He particularly drew literary inspiration from , a fellow Korean writer living in the Soviet Union who – in believing in national emancipation by upholding socialist principles – had already written about anti-Japanese guerrillas. Thus he acquired a nationalistic and class conscious worldview in his literature. Before emigrating from the Soviet Union It is possible that Cho translated Kim Il-sung's victory speech of 1945 into Korean. Cho moved to North Korea that year. Cho studied at the Korean Teachers College in Voroshilov-Ussuriysk between 1928 and 1931. During that time, he was also a member of the communist youth league of the Soviet Union, Komsomol. Cho was initially supposed to enroll at the Moscow University, but he was robbed at a train station in Omsk. With no money, Cho was stranded and had to work at a kolkhoz in Omsk for the summer to get some. The rector of the Omsk University, Aleksandr Sergeevitch Slivko was touched by his fate and decided to admit him in the university. Thus, from 1933 until his graduation in 1937, he attended the Faculty of Literature of the Gorky Omsk State Pedagogical University. Although he was not fluent in Russian upon entering the university, he graduated with excellent marks, and his time spent there amplified his Russian and Soviet sides. He returned to the Far East and took up teaching responsibilities at the Korean Pedagogical Institute in Vladivostok until all ethnic Koreans were forcibly moved to Central Asia, and the Institute along with Cho were relocated to Kzyl-Orda, Kazakh SSR in 1937. The following year Cho went to Moscow and tried to enroll at the Moscow Literature University, only to find himself arrested on the spot for breaking the law confining Koreans to Central Asia. He then returned to the Institute in Kzyl-Orda and worked there until 1941. In the late 1930s, Cho married Kim Hae-sŏn. The two had a son, Yurii Cho, born in 1939. Between 1942 and 1943, Cho served in the Soviet 25th Army's headquarters in Voroshilov-Ussuriysk in desk duty, and in a similar assignment in the Pacific Navy in Khabarovsk between 1943 and 1945 and in the First Far Eastern Front from October 1945. A part of his job was to write propaganda leaflets spread by the Soviet Red Army in Korea. Biographer Tatiana Gabroussenko thinks it is probable that he also translated the first speech given by Kim Il-sung after the liberation, on 14 October 1945, called \\"Every Effort for the Building of a New Democratic Korea\\", into Korean. The original speech was written by Soviet officers. Cho entered North Korea with the Red army that year. Creating model literature in North Korea Immediately after the liberation of Korea, Soviet authorities sent Cho, who was fluent in both Korean and Russian, to North Korea in order to shape the country's literary institutions on the Soviet model. Cho diligently followed the Workers' Party's instructions to \\"immerse [oneself] in the masses\\" and would visit factories, villages and farms and write poems based on these experiences. His experiences in the Soviet Union helped him in producing explicitly political works. Many other authors were not equally adept to write about political subjects and were reluctant to visit places of work. His role in shaping North Korean literature was to be pivotal. Cho's early works Mt. Paektu (MR: Paektusan, 1947) and Land (MR: Ttang, 1946) would point out the direction that North Korean literature was about to take. These works would soon become models for North Korean literature. Upon his return, he started writing for Chosŏn Sinmun, the Soviet Red Army's Korean-language paper, working as a correspondent and translator. He translated works of such Soviet poets as Mayakovsky, Gribachev, and Jambyl Jabayev. The literary circles of the time were based on divisions in North Korean politics as a whole. Cho associated himself with the other ethnic Koreans who had come from the Soviet Union. This literary group was close to the political Soviet Koreans faction. During the Korean War, Cho worked for Rodong Sinmun and also wrote propaganda poems. Before the war, he had been a member of the Standing Committee of the North Korean Literary and Art Federation. In 1951, he was selected the vice-chairman of the unified Korean Federation of Literature and Arts (MR: Chosŏn munhakyesul ch'ongdongmaeng, KFLA) which was chaired by Han Sorya. He was a member of its subdivision called the Literature Organization (MR: Munhak tongmaeng). Works In the Soviet Union While still at the Pedagogical Institute, Cho released a novel describing the anti-Japanese armed struggle. It is similar in content to his later work Mt. Paektu. The novel might have acted as a prototype for it. In addition to poetry and poetic criticism, Cho was interested in drama. Cho contributed to the creation of a drama called Hong Beom-do, about the revolutionary Hong Beom-do, by Tae Jang-chun and other Koreans living in the Soviet Union. Mt. Paektu retains elements from this work, too. He published his first poem the age of 17 in a Korean newspaper, Sŏnbong, in Russia. Between 1930 and 1933 he wrote poems such as \\"The Morning of the Construction\\", \\"To the Advanced Workers\\", \\"The Military Field Study\\" and \\"Paris Commune\\". While still in the Soviet Union, he also wrote poems \\"To Rangers\\" and \\"Outdoor Practice\\". In North Korea After moving to North Korea, Cho released \\"New Year\\". Other poems by him include: \\"Tuman River\\" (MR: Tumanggang, 1946) about the suffering of Koreans under Japanese rule and \\"Our Way\\" (Uri-ŭi kil, 1949) on Soviet-Korean friendship. The Song of Life (Saeng'ai-ŭi Norae, 1950) is a long epic about industrialization. It praises the country's developing industry but fails to take note of its roots in Japanese projects during the occupation. It also features a theme often found in Stalinist fiction: \\"class enemies\\" that seek to hamper progress. Other poems include: Land, \\"Aircraft Hunters\\", \\"On the Burning Street\\" (Pul'anŭn kŏriesŏ, 1950), \\"Korean Mother\\" (Chosŏn-ŭi ŏmŏni, 1950), \\" My Heights\\" (Na-ŭi koji, 1951), \\"We are Korean Youth\\" (Urinŭn Chosŏn Ch'ŏngnyŏnida, 1951) as well as lyric poems \\"Swing\\" (Kŭne) and \\"Sitting On a White Rock\\" (Hŭin pauie anjaso, 1947). The serial poem Resistance in Yosu (Hangjaeng-ŭi yŏsu) tells about the Yosu uprising in South Korea. The lyric epic Land was written on the Workers' Party's orders on producing works about the land reform in North Korea after the liberation, and was the first poem to describe the topic. Cho wrote lyrics for \\"Mungyong Pass\\", a song about Korean People's Army soldiers fighting their way through Kyonggi to Ryongnam. While all of the poems are thoroughly ideological, some South Korean scholars such as Yi Chang-ju of the North Research Institution have sought to emphasize Cho's lyrical side in order to \\"domesticate\\" him to serve rapprochement between the two countries' cultural orientations. Some of Cho's poems have been adapted into popular music lyrics that enjoy popularity in the South as well as the North. (Hŭip'aram), \\"Willow\\" (Suyang pŏtŭl) and \\"Swing\\" are love songs that were inspired by a more relaxed cultural atmosphere following the translation of Russian-language poetry into Korean. These influences include Mikhail Isakovsky's \\"Katyusha\\", to which \\"Whistle\\" in particular bears likeness. \\"Whistle\\", adapted as a popular song in 1990, is often seen in the South as a non-political song. However, according to Gabroussenko, South Korean observers often fail to notice the political and cultural elements borrowed from Isakovsky and Soviet lyrical poetry. In \\"Whistle\\", for instance, the couple embodies exemplary socialist traits: =Mt. Paektu= Cho's epic Mt. Paektu promotes Kim Il-sung as a heroic guerrilla well-suited to lead the country. Cho's long epic poem Mt. Paektu was written in February 1947 and published in 1948 in Rodong Sinmun. It was the first poem written about Kim Il-sung, whom the original version of the poem simply refers to as \\"Commander Kim\\". The poem, which tells the story of the Battle of Pochonbo in 1937, is a classic in literature portraying the anti-Japanese struggle. Its text inextricably links Kim Il-sung's person with Paektu Mountain, the namesake height of the poema connection that has remained central in North Korean propaganda to this day. The poem has its origins in Cho's fascination with the anti-Japanese guerrillas, including and Choe Hyon, with whom he had met. The creation of the epic was politically motivated, too, as the Soviets, who had dispatched Cho to North Korea, wanted to strengthen Kim Il-sung's grip on power. Publications presenting him as a legendary anti-Japanese hero were needed, and so Mt. Paektu was born. The work is dedicated \\"to the glorious Soviet Army that liberated Korea\\", and is written with the Soviets and not the Koreans in mind. Due to vigorous promotion of a \\"mass culture\\" in both the output and readership of literature, copies of Mt. Paektu were printed by the hundreds of thousands, more than any work in the history of Korean literature before that. Generally speaking, the poem was well received. The public was interested and young readers acclaimed it. It was liked in the KFLA as it employed revolutionary romanticism in its portrayal of Kim. Kim personally liked the poem, too, and began visiting Cho's home. In his memoirs With the Century, Kim writes that he was the first person to listen to Cho recite the poem and liked its \\"jewel-like sentences\\". More than esthetic, Kim says he was attracted to the content and they both \\"shed tears\\" when Cho chanted a passage about fallen comrades. In keeping with its nature as propaganda, the content of Mt. Paektu exaggerates Kim Il-sung's activities during the liberation struggle. The poem presents Kim as having heroic, transcendental, humane and warm qualities. He is represented as a popular hero that the people look up to, suggesting that he is the right person to lead the newly established state. Politically, Mt. Paektu was very effective in the newly founded state. As such, it became a \\"new classic\\", a model for the cult of personality of Kim Il-sung perpetuated by subsequent works of literature in North Korea. According to B. R. Myers, the work exemplifies particular traits of an early cult of personality built upon Soviet Marxism–Leninism and bloc conformity, which were soon replaced by Korean ethnic nationalism of writers like Han Sorya. While Cho's Kim Il-sung is a brilliant strategist who has masculine qualities like strength and intellect, in Han's works he embodies traditional Korean virtues of innocence and naivety having \\"mastered Marxism–Leninism with his heart, not his brain\\". The ethnically inspired style of Han would establish itself as the standard of propaganda over Cho's. Benoit Berthelier, however, sees continuity in Cho's work and contemporary propaganda. According to him, Cho can be credited with having created a genre of \\"revolutionary romanticism\\", which systematized the use of legends and supernatural imagery in Kim and his successors' cult of personality. Long epic poetry was not a popular genre in North Korea before Mt. Paektu, but it was in the Soviet Union where Cho had immigrated from. Poema and Mayakovsky's prosody and poetry were also among Cho's influences that can be seen in Mt. Paektu. These Russian stylistic influences gave Mt. Paektu its peculiar characteristics that prompted mixed reactions from the North Korean public. For instance, some in the literature circles were unfamiliar with the concept of a lyrical epic and thought of it as an improbable amalgam of genres, criticizing the work for being indistinguishable from ordinary prose. According to North Korean studies scholar Alzo David- West, the relatively favorable reaction to Mt. Paektu compared to some other literature testifies to North Korean readership being capable at being both a receptive and a dismissive audience. South Korean scholars have presented two competing views about Mt. Paektu: academics of the older generation typically dismiss Mt. Paektu as \\"personality cult literature\\". Younger generation minjung and leftist scholars, however, see guerrillas other than Kim Il-sung – such as Ch'ŏl-ho, Kkot-pun, and Sŏk-jun – and by extension, the people, as the \\"hero\\" of the story. For some of them, like Sin Tong-ho, excluding the role of others than Kim Il-sung is an outright obstruction for creating a national unity in literature. The 1947 text has been revised three times because of changes within the political system of North Korea to produce \\"heavily revised chuch'e [Juche] editions\\": in 1955, 1986 and 1995. The original version of the poem invokes Russian Civil War heroes Vasily Chapayev, Nikolay Shchors and Sergey Lazo, while a newer revision omits them and concentrates on indigenous assets: The work was adapted on stage by Han T'ae-ch'ŏn. It has been translated into English, Arabic, French, German, Russian, Spanish, Czech, Polish, Chinese, Japanese, and Mongolian. Of these, the Mongolian one was deemed \\"distorted\\" by North Koreans and sparked a diplomatic crisis in 1976, resulting in expulsion of the Mongolian ambassador to the country. Death and legacy Cho died on 31 July 1951 in his office in Pyongyang during an American bombing raid in the war. Mt. Paektu received the National Prize, first class, in 1948. Cho's works were awarded the Festival Prize, the country's highest literary honor, modeled after the Stalin Prize. He also was awarded the Order of the National Flag, second class, for his work during the war in 1951, as well as a posthumous National Prize, first class, in 1952 for his cycle of poems Korea is Fighting (MR: Chosŏnŏn Ssaunda, 1951). His resting place is at the Patriotic Martyrs' Cemetery, in Pyongyang. Today, Cho is regarded as the founding father of North Korean socialist realist poetry, or indeed poetry in general, or even North Korean literature as a whole. In the mid-1950s many Soviet Koreans, including Cho's close friends, were discredited in purges. According to Gabroussenko, Cho's untimely death in 1951 may have spared him his reputation from that loss of official recognition. With the exception of a period in the 1970s when Cho's name was barely mentioned in official publications, his legacy has benefited from continued popularity in North Korea.

Transducer (sensor) coils are typically placed on the tongue and lips. Electromagnetic articulography (EMA) is a method of measuring the position of parts of the mouth. EMA uses sensor coils placed on the tongue and other parts of the mouth to measure their position and movement over time during speech and swallowing. Induction coils around the head produce an electromagnetic field that creates, or induces, a current in the sensors in the mouth. Because the current induced is inversely proportional to the cube of the distance, a computer is able to analyse the current produced and determine the sensor coil's location in space. EMA is used in linguistics and speech pathology to study articulation and in medicine to study oropharyngeal dysphagia. Other methods have been used to study articulation and ingestion with tradeoffs in the kind and amount of data available. Palatography allows the study of articulations that make contact with the palate such as some lingual consonants, but unlike EMA, palatographs cannot provide data on sounds which do not make contact such as vowels. Fluoroscopy and x-ray microbeam allow the investigation of non-contact movements of the mouth like EMA, but expose subjects to ionizing radiation which limits the amount of data that can be collected from a given participant. Principles of operation The ability to observe the movements of articulators has been of great importance to the study of phonetics in order to understand the way sounds are produced. Electromagnetic articulography uses the principle of electromagnetic induction to measure the position and movement of various points in and around the mouth. A helmet containing electromagnetic transmitters creates a variable magnetic field by running currents through the transmitters at different frequencies. Sensor coils placed midsagittally in the mouth produce current as they move through the magnetic field inversely proportional to the cube of the distance from the transmitters. The current induced alternates at the same frequency as the transmitter coil and the composite signal can be separated out to determine the distance from each individual coil, thus determining the position of the sensor in space. In two-dimensional articulography, transmitter coils are placed in an equilateral triangle along the midsagittal plane at the forehead, chin, and neck. Because of the geometric orientation of the transmitter coils, accurate readings are able to be taken as long as the sensor coils placed on the tongue stay within about a centimeter of the midsagittal plane and are not angled at more than 30 degrees. Articulographs able to measure in three dimensions use six transmitter coils organized in a spherical configuration. The transmitters are arranged so that the axis of a sensor coil is never perpendicular to more than three transmitters. Through the transmitter configuration and ability to measure in multiple dimensions, three-dimensional articulographs are able to make measurements outside of the midsagittal plane. 2D articulographs require restrictive headmounts to ensure that the subject's head does not move off the plane of measurement. Because 3D articulographs are able to measure outside of the midsagittal plane, a less restrictive headmount is able to be used. Development of two and three dimensional sensors Thomas Hixon was the first to describe the use of electromagnetic principles to measure articulation. In his letter to the editor, published in The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, he described a setup using two sensor coils and one generator coil. The sensor coils, attached to the forehead and back of the neck, would remain stationary while the generator coil, attached to the jaw, would move creating variable currents in the sensor coils. These currents could then be used to determine the distance in two dimensions. Early EMA systems like Hixon's had problems with accounting for tilting of the tongue during use as tilting of the sensor coils causes changes in the induced current that can skew data. In 1987, Paul Schönle et al. published an improved system that used three transmitter coils (analogous to Hixon's generator coil) and computer software to triangulate the position of sensor coils and account for tilt. However modern two-dimensional systems are still unable to compensate for tilting of sensors past 30 degrees and measurement is distorted if sensor coils are moved off the centerline of the mouth. In 1993, Andreas Zierdt published a description of an articulograph that would be able to measure movement in three dimensions, though three dimensional articulographs have only been commercially available since around 2009. Zierdt's conceptualization placed six transmitter coils equidistant from each other. Because sensor coils are dipoles, when they are perpendicular to a transmitter coil the current induced is zero, so Zierdt angled the transmitter coils so that for any given rotation of a sensor coil, it was not perpendicular to more than three transmitter coils allowing for at least three transmitter coils to triangulate the position of the sensor. Visualisation of the tongue motions of a trumpet player Effect on subjects As sensor coils are placed on the tongue of the subject, articulation may be affected depending on the placement of the coils, but no comparative analysis has shown whether articulation is altered because of the coils. The coils are about 3mm in size and are not considered to be a particularly large source of error for measurements. Some researchers have found that subjects are irritated by sensor coils placed on the tip of the tongue which can lead to disturbed articulation. Similarly, the wires attached to the sensor coils can inhibit articulation if not run out the side of the mouth. It has not been shown that long term exposure to electromagnetic fields is harmful to human health, but it is recommended to avoid subjects who are pregnant or who utilize pacemakers. Guidelines place the limit for safe continuous exposure between 100μT and 200μT. The field and frequencies output by electromagnetic articulographs are comparable to those put out by computer terminals with the maximum measured being about 10μT. Alternative methods Various diagnostic techniques preceded electromagnetic articulography. Palatography and electropalatography Palatography and electropalatography both measure contact of the tongue with the palate and thus are unable to measure articulations that do not make contact with the palate such as vowels. Palatography involves the painting of a colored substance onto the tongue which is then transferred onto the palate during articulation. A picture is then taken of the palate to record the location of contact and, if another palatogram is to be taken, the mouth is washed out and the tongue repainted. A particularly low cost method that is often used in fieldwork, it can be difficult to collect large amounts of data. Electropalatography involves the use of a custom-fitted artificial palate containing electrodes that measure contact. While able to record multiple contacts, the artificial palate may obstruct or interfere with articulation, and each subject requires a custom-fitted palate. Video fluoroscopy Video fluoroscopy uses x-ray radiation to produce moving pictures of the mouth during articulation or swallowing. It is considered the gold standard in studies of dysphagia because of its ability to take videos of the entire digestive tract during swallowing events. It is often used to study and treat aspiration of food, what parts of the digestive tract are malfunctioning during swallowing, and positions in which swallowing is easiest. Only limited data is able to be collected as sessions are typically limited to three minutes due to the hazards of radiation exposure. and it does not allow for fine grain analysis of tongue movements. X-ray microbeam Similar to video fluoroscopy, X-ray microbeam studies use radiation to study movements of articulators. Gold pellets, 2 to 3 mm in size, are placed in and around the mouth similar to the coils used in EMA. Radiation exposure is limited by using computer software to focus narrow x-ray beams, about 6mm2, on the pellets and track them as they move. Like EMA, x-ray microbeam studies are limited by the placement of the pellets. While able to minimize radiation exposure, the system is largely inaccessible as it is unique to the University of Wisconsin.

Algirdas organized the raids against Dmitry Donskoy in support of the Principality of Tver, chief rival of Moscow. In 1368 and 1370, Lithuanians besieged Moscow and burned the posad, but did not succeed in taking the city's Kremlin. In 1372, the Lithuanian army was stopped near Lyubutsk where, after a standoff, the Treaty of Lyubutsk was concluded. Lithuanians agreed to cease their aid to Tver, which was defeated in 1375. Mikhail II of Tver had to acknowledge Dmitry as \\"elder brother\\". Background Influence and power of the Grand Duchy of Moscow grew steadily and its interests clashed with those of Lithuania. After the Battle of Blue Waters in 1362 Lithuania took over the Principality of Kiev and became a direct neighbor of Moscow. In 1368, Mikhail II of Tver became Prince of Tver. Dmitry Donskoy and Alexius, Metropolitan of Moscow, invited Mikhail to Moscow and imprisoned him. Mikhail was released when envoys of the Golden Horde arrived and Dmitry did not want to involve the Tatars in the Moscow–Tver dispute. Mikhail fled to Lithuania to ask assistance of Algirdas, who was married to his sister Uliana of Tver. Algirdas decided to assist the Principality of Tver, chief rival of Moscow, and sought to put Mikhail on the throne of Vladimir, a long-time possession of Moscow. Conflict First raid Dmitry Donskoy writes letters, asking for help against Algirdas during the Lithuanian–Muscovite War (1368–1372) In 1368, Algirdas gathered a large army, which included his brother Kęstutis and forces from Tver and Smolensk. The army was assembled in secret and marched quietly so that not to give an advance warning to the Russians. After crossing the Lithuania–Russia border, Lithuanians began pillaging and burning various villages while Russians hastily assembled a defensive force, commanded by Dmitry Minin (boyar of Dmitry Donskoy) and Akinfiev Shuba (boyar of Vladimir the Bold). Lithuanians killed Semion, son of Prince Dmitry of Starodub-on-the-Klyazma. They then captured Obolensk killing Prince Konstantin Obolensky. On November 21, 1368, the Lithuanians defeated the Russian defense forces on the Trosna River and killed its commanders and other boyars. Dmitry Donskoy retreated to the Moscow Kremlin, behind the walls that were completed just a few months before, and ordered to burn the posad so that the Russian defense would have a better position. The Lithuanians surrounded the Kremlin, burned and looted, but retreated three days later without a serious attempt at taking the stronghold. Second raid In early 1370, Moscow attacked Tver and Bryansk which belonged to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Mikhail II of Tver traveled to the Golden Horde and obtained a yarlyk for the throne of Vladimir. Mikhail attempted to establish his rule in Vladimir, but failed and retreated to Lithuania asking for help. At the end of November 1370, Algirdas organized the second raid towards Moscow. His forces included his brother Kęstutis, Mikhail II of Tver, and Svyatoslav II of Smolensk. On November 26, the Lithuanian army besieged Volokolamsk. The battle continued for two days. Lithuanians killed Prince Vasily Ivanovich Berezuysky, commander of the city's defenses, but did not succeed in capturing the city. The army marched forward and besieged Moscow on December 6. Algirdas' forces burned and pillaged, but did not succeed in taking the city's Kremlin where Dmitry Donskoy had retreated. This time Donskoy had allies ready to march: his cousin Vladimir the Bold in Peremyshl and Prince Vladimir of Pronsk with troops from Ryazan. Therefore, a truce was concluded and Algirdas retreated after eight days. Between the raids After the 1370 raid, Alexius, Metropolitan of Moscow, excommunicated all Russian princes that supported the Lithuanians; these excommunications were quickly approved by Patriarch Philotheus I of Constantinople. Algirdas responded with his own letter listing injustices committed by the Russians. In particular, Algirdas complained that Dmitry Donskoy attacked nine Lithuanian fortresses on the upper Volga and Oka Rivers and requested appointment of a new metropolitan bishop of Lithuania. The Patriarch sent apocrisiarius Cyprian to Lithuania to investigate. Algirdas succeeded in winning over Cyprian and eventually promoting him to Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus'. But it seems Algirdas also wanted peace as his daughter Helen married Vladimir the Bold at the end of 1371. In the meantime, Tver and Moscow continued to compete and each obtained new yarlyks for Vladimir. In spring 1372, Lithuanians raided Russian lands again. This time Algirdas did not participate. The Lithuanian Army was commanded by Kęstutis and his son Vytautas and Algirdas' son Andrei of Polotsk. They attacked Pereslavl-Zalessky, burned the posad and churches, looted and extracted a ransom. At the same time Mikhail II of Tver attacked Dmitrov. Then the two armies attacked Kashin and its duke acknowledged Tver's suzerainty. Then the Lithuanian Army retreated through Tver and Torzhok. Third raid The third and the last campaign by Algirdas was organized in summer 1372. This time Dmitry Donskoy marched with his army to meet the invaders and the Lithuanian army was stopped near Lyubutsk, a fort on the Oka River northeast of Tula. Lithuanian vanguard troops were defeated and had to retreat. The two armies were separated by a steep ravine which was not suitable landscape for combat. After a period of standoff, the Treaty of Lyubutsk was concluded. Algirdas agreed to abandon the plans of promoting Mikhail thus ending Lithuania's assistance to Tver. Aftermath Mikhail II of Tver did not end his war with Moscow. He once again obtained a yarlyk for Vladimir and attempted to establish his rule. Dmitry Donskoy assembled a large army and besieged Tver. Dmitry had support of many Russian dukes, including Svyatoslav II of Smolensk who fought for Mikhail in 1370 (Lithuanians revenged that by raiding Smolensk in fall 1375). Seeing an overwhelming force and not having his Lithuanian allies, on September 3, 1375, Mikhail agreed to acknowledge Dmitry as elder brother and abandoned independent dealings with the Lithuanians or the Golden Horde. Thus while Mikhail retained his title, the Principality of Tver became dependent on Moscow. Khan Mamai burned Novosil as retribution for breaking the yarlyk, but it was too late to change the situation. The raids to Moscow consumed many resources at the time when Lithuania faced another war with the Teutonic Order and suffered several defeats, particularly the Battle of Rudau in February 1370. The raids were a tactical defeat. Lithuania did not gain any new territory and lost Tver, one of its most reliable allies. They strengthened Moscow's prestige and influence in Rus' and signified that Lithuanian eastward expansion into Slavic lands was coming to an end. The peace between Lithuania and Moscow lasted for about seven years until 1379, when after the death of Algirdas in 1377 his eldest son Andrei of Polotsk allied himself with Moscow against Jogaila. Story according to Lithuanian chronicles The raids were not mentioned by the early Lithuanian Chronicles. The Bychowiec Chronicle, a late and generally unreliable source, introduced the war to Lithuanian historiography. The chronicle merged the three raids into one and added a colorful exchange of threats between Algirdas and Dmitry Donskoy. In one of the threats, Algirdas promises to kiss Dmitry with his spear and to rest his spear against the Kremlin's Wall. Algirdas then invades the Grand Duchy of Moscow and Dmitry Donskoy sues for peace offering a large ransom. Algirdas accepts but, just as he promised, rests his spear against the Kremlin's Wall. The poetic visual was repeated by Maciej Stryjkowski, Albert Wijuk Kojałowicz and later historians with various modifications. The description in the Bychowiec Chronicle is clearly a piece of Lithuanian propaganda. The chronicle was compiled in the first half of the 16th century when Lithuania and Moscow were engaged in a series of Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars. The wars were unsuccessful for Lithuania – it lost a significant portion of its territory, including the strategically important Smolensk in 1514. Therefore, the chronicle used the historical event to encourage the Lithuanians to fight. The episode with the spear was probably borrowed from Polish historiography: King Boleslaus I of Poland used his sword (Szczerbiec) to hit the Golden Gate in Kiev in 1018.

GL-ONC1 (CAS Registry Number (CAS RN): 1473430-36-2) is a triple modified and attenuated vaccinia virus (Lister strain) that causes regression and elimination of a wide range of solid tumors in preclinical mouse models. It was generated by insertion of three expression cassettes (encoding Renilla luciferase-Aequorea green fluorescent protein fusion, beta-galactosidase, and beta-glucuronidase) into the F14.5L, J2R (encoding thymidine kinase) and A56R (encoding hemagglutinin) loci of the parental viral Lister strain genome, respectively. The oncolytic virus specifically infects and kills tumor cells which leads to oncolysis, immune activation and triggering anti-tumor immune responses.

The barony is in size. It is one of 12 baronies in County Kilkenny. Unusually for a barony, it contains only two civil parishes which together comprise 65 townlands. The chief town is Callan. The barony is bordered by the baronies of Shillelogher to the north (whose chief town is Bennettsbridge) and by Kells to the south (whose chief town is Kells). The N76 road bisects the barony. Notable features include Callan Motte and Callan Augustinian Friary. Callan was an early medieval cantred within the shire of Kilkenny, and part of the historic kingdom of Osraige (Ossory). Today it is part of the Roman Catholic Church diocese of Ossory and the Church of Ireland diocese of Cashel and Ossory. Callan is currently administered by Kilkenny County Council. Etymology The barony, town, and liberties, of Callan, take their name from the river Callainn, now the King's River. The name in Irish, Callainn (pronounce Colling), comes from the Irish cala or caladh meaning, \\"callow land\\", and this refers to long coarse grass which grew in summer along the river bank after being waterlogged all winter. History The barony was part of in the historic Gaelic kingdom of Osraige (Ossory) and the territory of the Ua Glóiairn clan of Callann. According to O'Heerin's Topographical Poem (1420) at the time of the Norman invasion the area was the territory of the clan called the Ua Glóiairn of Callann. The Ó Glóiairn (O'Gloran) were chiefs of Callainn, the area of the \\"cantred of O'Glóiairn\\", lying on both sides of the King's River. This later became the \\"Liberties of Callan\\". Callan town and the surrounding area were a cantred in the 13th century, and the area was often included in the barony of Kells or Shillelogher. The town of Callan received a charter from William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke in 1217. In the Down Survey (1656) it was called \\"Callan Liberties\\", however, the 1836 Act explicitly states the town and liberties of Callan \\"shall be deemed and taken to be a barony\\". The barony was recorded the 1840 Ordnance Survey map and Griffith's Valuation (1864). In the 18th century County Kilkenny consisted of the Liberties of Kilkenny and of Callan and the baronies of Galmoy, Lower Ossory, Fassadinig, Cranagh, Shellilogher, Gowran, Kells, Knocktopher, Ida, Igrin, Iverk and Ibercon. By the 19th century these were restructured into the baronies of Callan, Crannagh, Fassadinin, Galmoy, Gowran, Ida, Iverk, Kells, Knocktopher, and Shillelogher. Geography Callan Augustinian Friary in Callan. Today, the county of Kilkenny is subdivided into 12 baronies. These include Kilkenny in the centre of the county, and clockwise from north of the county, Fassadinin, Gowran, Ida, Kilculliheen, Iverk, Knocktopher, Kells, Callan, Shillelogher, Crannagh, Galmoy. Callan lies to the west of the county, with the baronies of Shillelogher to the north and Kells to the south. Unusually for a barony, it contains only two civil parishes Callan and Killaloe. It is made up of 65 townlands. The Kings River flows through it, and was previously called the Callan River. Places of interest include Callan Motte and Callan Augustinian Friary. Today it is part of the Roman Catholic Church diocese of Ossory and the Church of Ireland diocese of Cashel and Ossory. Callan is currently administered by Kilkenny County Council.

Born in Bucharest, her parents were the writer Vasile Demetrius and his wife Antigona (née Rabinovici). Her beloved father had attended Saint Sava High School, where one of his classmates was Ion G. Duca, who would become Lucia's godfather. Her mother was a baptized Jew; she had numerous siblings and the family was very poor. Al. Săndulescu, \\"între bunăcredinţă şi conformism (I)\\" , România Literară, nr. 6/2006 She attended the elite Maria Brâncoveanu central school from 1921 to 1928; its director, to whom she grew close, was the widow of Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea. This was followed by the University of Bucharest, where she earned degrees in literature (1931) and philosophy (1932). A student at the Dramatic Arts Conservatory from 1928 to 1931, she had Ion Manolescu as a professor. She formed part of the Sburătorul literary circle. Asking Ion Marin Sadoveanu for help in finding a job, he sent her to act at Cernăuți, and would also appear at Brașov and Bucharest, invariably in minor roles. Demetrius made her theatrical debut with the 13+1 company, founded by George Mihail Zamfirescu, for whom she developed an unrequited love. Too affected in her style to realize her ambition of becoming a successful actress, she left the stage after performing one last role in a play by Ferdinand Bruckner. In 1934, she began studying aesthetics in Paris, where she intended to take a doctorate under Charles Lalo, but returned home not long after. A promised scholarship had not arrived and she lacked the means to support herself, and was also disillusioned and ill. From 1936 to 1941 she was a clerk at the offices of Nicolae Malaxa, who facilitated a trip to Italy for her. During World War II and the attendant anti-Jewish laws, she feared persecution due to her background. Although her name was removed from a theatrical poster where she was listed as translator, she was allowed to join a large group of writers attending the inauguration of the Romanian theatre in Odessa, capital of the Transnistria Governorate. Over the course of the war, she worked as a nurse at a hospital for wounded soldiers, located in her former high school building; the activity would later draw criticism from the Romanian Communist Party. From 1944 to 1949, she taught at the workers' conservatory, was first secretary for the press at the Information Ministry between 1946 and 1949, and worked as a theatre director at Sibiu, Brașov and Bacău from 1950 to 1952. Her writing debut came in 1933, with articles and literary fragments in Rampa and Adevărul literar și artistic. She submitted work for Vremea and for left-wing publications such as Cuvântul liber, and reviewed plays for Rampa and Evenimentul. Her first novel was the 1936 Tinerețe. Published thanks to the help of an encouraging Camil Petrescu, it was favorably reviewed by Eugen Lovinescu but received a categorically negative note from George Călinescu. This was followed by Marea fugă (1938), Primăvara pe Târnave (vol. I-II, 1960-1963) and Lumea începe cu mine (1968). Her first play, Turneu în provincie, appeared in 1946. She would become among the most prolific Romanian playwrights of her day, with Cumpăna (1949), Vadul nou (1951), Premiera (1952), Oameni de azi (1952), Trei generații (1956) and Vlaicu și feciorii lui (1959), among others, as well as a large number of one- act works. A leading practitioner of socialist realism, she was much appreciated by the communist regime. Her short story collections include Destine (1939), Album de familie (1945), Oglinda (1957), Nunta Ilonei (1960), Făgăduielile (1964), La ora ceaiului (1970), Întoarcerea la miracol (1974), Te iubesc, viață (1984) and Plimbare în parcul liniștit (1987); she also authored the 1971 volume of travel notes Acuarele. Authors whom she translated include William Shakespeare, Charles Perrault, Gustave Flaubert, Victor Hugo, Honoré de Balzac, Alexandre Dumas, Ivan Turgenev, Guy de Maupassant, Konstantin Stanislavski, Marcel Achard, Vitaly Bianki, Ivan Bunin, Julien Green and Louis Bromfield.

He was based in the town of Tebnine and was head of the Ali al-Saghir clan.Harris, 2012, p. 122 Under his leadership, the Jabal Amil prospered, due largely to the revenues from dyed cotton cloth exports to European merchants.Winter, 2010, p. 133 Rule Conflict and alliance with Zahir al-Umar Nasif used the fortress of Tebnine as his headquarters Nasif succeeded his brother Zahir al-Nassar as head of the Ali al-Saghir clan after Zahir died in a fall from his palace roof in 1749. Between 1750 and 1768, Nasif engaged in intermittent conflict with the autonomous Arab ruler of northern Palestine, Zahir al-Umar. In 1766, Nasif was defeated by Zahir al-Umar.Winter, 2010, p. 135(See Joudah). In September 1767, the enmity between Zahir and Nasif was such that the French consul in the area described Nasif as the principal adversary of Zahir. However, by 1768, Nasif and Zahir entered into a close and durable alliance, with both parties benefiting in their cooperation against the Ottoman governors of Sidon and Damascus. From then on, Zahir acted as the intermediary and protector of Nasif and the Shia clans vis-a-vis the Ottoman provincial authorities. Nasif, in turn, accompanied Zahir in many of his campaigns against the latter's rivals in Palestine, including the sheikhs of Jabal Nablus. Nasif and Zahir challenged the authority of the Ottoman governors of Sidon and Damascus and their Druze allies who dominated Mount Lebanon. When this coalition of Ottoman forces launched an offensive against Nasif and Zahir in 1771, the forces of the latter two routed them in Lake Hula.Harris, 2012, p. 120 After the Battle of Lake Hula, Nasif's forces, who numbered some 3,000 horsemen, decisively defeated a 40,000-strong Druze force under Emir Yusuf Shihab,Blanford, 2011, p. 12 killing some 1,500 Druze warriors. According to Baron Francois de Tott, a French mercenary of the Ottoman Army, Nasif's cavalry \\"put them to flight at the first onset\\". Afterward, Nasif and Zahir's forces captured the city of Sidon, the capital of its namesake province, which included the Galilee and Jabal Amil. This victory marked the peak of Shia power in Lebanon region during the Ottoman era (1517–1917),Winter, 2010, p. 136 and according to de Tott, the Metawalis became a \\"formidable name [sic]\\". Together, Nasif and Zahir ensured unprecedented security in the Galilee and south Lebanon. Following the victory at Sidon, Nasif gradually reconciled with Emir Yusuf and the powerful Druze Jumblatt clan. In September 1773, he backed Emir Yusuf in the Beqaa Valley when the latter was being attacked by Uthman Pasha's forces. Uthman Pasha's troops fled the battle when Nasif's arrival became apparent.Winter, 2010, p. 139 Downfall Zahir was defeated and killed in his capital of Acre in 1775 by the Ottomans, after which the Ottomans appointed Jezzar Pasha as Governor of Sidon and Acre. In 1780, after having consolidated his hold over the Galilee and defeating Zahir's sons, Jezzar Pasha launched an offensive against the rural sheikhs of Jabal Amil.Mishaqah, 1988, p. 19 On 24 September 1781, Nasif was shot dead in a battle with Jezzar Pasha's troops,Winter, 2010, p. 141 who greatly outnumbered Nasif's cavalry,Blanford, 2011, p. 13 that lasted three hours. About 470 of Nasif's soldiers were also killed in the confrontation, which occurred at Yaroun.Blanford, 2011, pp. 12-13. Nasif's defeat and death effectively marked the end of Shia autonomy in Jabal Amil during the Ottoman era. Jezzar Pasha's troops proceeded to loot Shia religious places and burned many of their religious texts. Nasif's death was followed by the exile of rural Shia sheikhs to Akkar, an exodus of Shia ulama to Iraq, Iran and elsewhere, and the start of a campaign by the new head of the Ali al-Saghir clan, Hamza ibn Muhammad al-Nassar, to resist Jezzar Pasha's rule. Hamza was eventually pursued and executed. With the coming to power of Bashir Shihab II and Jezzar's replacement with Sulayman Pasha after Jezzar's death in 1804, the two leaders agreed a settlement with the Shia clans, appointing Nasif's son Faris as Sheikh al-Mashayekh (Chief of Chiefs) of Nabatieh and its territories north of the Litani River.Harris, 2012, p. 133 Legacy Nasif is an ancestor of the Asaad, a Lebanese political family. In Jabal Amil's popular folklore, Nasif is held in high esteem for dying in defense of his people.Chalabi, 2006, p. 39 According to journalist Nicholas Blanford, the guerrilla campaigns of the predominantly Shia Amal Movement and Hezbollah against Israeli forces during the latter's occupation of South Lebanon (1982–2000) were \\"drawn, in part, from the same cultural well-spring of defiance and dignity that had sustained\\" Nasif's 18th-century military campaigns.

Twitchell was convicted of first degree murder in 2011 for killing John Brian \\"Johnny\\" Altinger. The criminal investigation and first-degree murder trial drew substantial media attention due to Twitchell's appreciation and emulation of the fictional serial killer Dexter Morgan.  Background  In fall of 2008, computer company contractor Gilles Tetreault logged on to the dating website Plenty of Fish and met someone he believed to be a young woman named Sheena. On October 3, Tetreault entered a garage in Edmonton expecting to pick Sheena up for a date. Instead, he was attacked by a man wearing a hockey mask and wielding a stun baton. After a violent struggle, he escaped, but did not report the attack to police. Tetreault claims that he did not report the attack because he was embarrassed. One week later, Johnny Altinger was murdered after being lured to the same address and attacked in the same way. Mark Twitchell, the man found guilty of Altinger's murder, was an aspiring filmmaker and a fan of the hit TV show Dexter. In his short film House of Cards, Twitchell wrote of a male killer luring a cheating husband on the pretense of a date with a woman, forcing personal information from him before stabbing and dismembering the man. During their investigation, homicide detectives seized a manuscript written by Twitchell, and which prosecutors assert is a generally accurate representation of what happened to Altinger. Tetreault has been nicknamed 'The One Who Got Away' by several media outlets.  Bibliography  *The One Who Got Away: Escape From The Kill Room (2015). Triplicity Publishing.

Health services  Delta Hospital is a 58-bed acute-care hospital that provides inpatient and outpatient services to a catchment area of more than 100,000 residents of Ladner, Tsawwassen, North Delta and the Tsawwassen First Nation. The hospital employs more than 580 workers. Health services include: *24/7 emergency care *diagnostic imaging *general surgery About 5,000 day surgeries are performed at the hospital each year. About 34,000 patients visit the Emergency Department, 34,000 visit for ambulatory care, and 29,000 tested for diagnostic imaging annually. The laboratory performs about 500,000 tests annually. The hospital also has Mountain View Manor on site that is a 92-bed residential care facility. Neighbouring facilities are the Delta Hospice Society, the municipal City Hall and the Ladner Leisure Centre. The annual operating budget for Delta Hospital is $43.2 million, an increase of 72 per cent since 2004/05 when the budget was $25.1 million. Fraser Health also funds $55 million in public health, mental health, home care, residential care, assisted living and hospice services in Delta community.  Volunteers and community philanthropy  The hospital is supported by the Delta Hospital Foundation and by the Delta Hospital Auxiliary Society. The Auxiliary provides more than 11,000 volunteer hours and operates a gift shop near the hospital's main lobby. It has contributed more than $18 million for equipment and projects. It supports Mountain View Manor with $65,000 annually for recreation programs and music therapy. Since 1988, the Foundation has raised more than $30 million for the hospital. The Foundation is currently campaigning to raise $7.5 million for the first phase of a 20-year expansion plan created in 2011.  History  Planning for the hospital began in the early 1960s. A Fact-Finding Committee was established in 1967, the centennial year of the Confederation of Canada. In 1974, Delta Municipal Council and the Greater Vancouver Regional Hospital District (GVRHD) jointly purchased the property where the hospital is now located. The first care facility, Mountain View Manor a 75-bed residential care facility, was opened in 1977. The acute-care hospital building with 75 beds was constructed then officially opened in September 1980, one year after the centennial of the creation of the municipality of Delta. The original governance of the Delta Centennial Hospital Society was transferred to the South Fraser Health Region. In 2001, governance transferred from the South Fraser Health Region to the newly created and larger Fraser Health Authority as part of a province-wide restructuring of health authorities by the provincial government. As part of the new authority's first hospital plans, the Delta facility was downgraded from acute-care to a sub-acute facility with 38 beds. A small intensive care unit was closed. There was also a proposal to close the Emergency Department during night-time hours that became part of a public controversy. The changes to the hospital status and capacity was a major factor in the high-profile campaign that attempted to recall Val Roddick who was the Member of the Legislative Assembly representing Delta South. The service changes also raised legal questions by community groups and by the municipal council. In 2008, Health Minister George Abbott and Fraser Health restored the hospital's acute-care status and re-opened 12 beds. By 2008, the physical size of the Emergency Department had tripled due to financial donations from the Delta Hospital Foundation A 64-slice CT scanner was added in 2009. In 2010, the municipal council approved a bylaw preventing pay parking at the hospital. It had been debated for six years and was the first of its kind in the Lower Mainland. In 2015, a petition with more than 10,000 signatures was presented to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia advocating for an additional $2 million to fund overnight operating rooms.

When first listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, ti encompassed a four-block stretch of Main Street (between 7th and 11th Streets) that was platted out in 1848, as growth of the city expanded to the northeast from its original nucleus. It was expanded in 1996 to include buildings on College Avenue between 10th and 11th Streets, which abut the original district bounds. Four houses survive that predate the American Civil War, although three of these were restyled later in the 19th century. Most of the properties were built before 1910, and are either vernacular or Colonial Revival in style. There are only a small number of Queen Anne, Shingle, and Craftsman style buildings. Two were designed by noted Arkansas architect Charles L. Thompson, and one, the Cook-Morrow House, is separately listed on the National Register.

It was formerly managed by the Herts and Middlesex Wildlife Trust (HMWT). In February 2016 HMWT announced that three sites, Barkway Chalk Pit, Hill End Pit and Pryor's Wood, which HMWT managed on behalf of their owner, North Hertfordshire District Council, were to return to Council management as the Trust was no longer able to meet the cost. It has the largest colony of Azeca goodalli snails in Hertfordshire. Plants include viper's bugloss, cowslip and marjoram, there are butterflies such as common blue and gatekeeper, and many birds including woodpeckers. The site is a Regionally important geological site (RIGS), dating to the Turonian age of the late Cretaceous around 90 million years ago, and was formerly a Site of Special Scientific Interest. According to A Geological Conservation Strategy for Hertfordshire, published by the Hertfordshire RIGS Group: :This pit is of national stratigraphic and international palaeontological importance, but has lost its original SSSI status and is now very degraded. It is the type locality of the Hitch Wood Hardground at the top of the Chalk Rock. This hardground is exceptionally fossiliferous here, and has probably yielded more fossils of all groups (notably ammonites) than any other Chalk Rock locality apart from the Kensworth Chalk Pit GCR site, Bedfordshire. The site gives its name to the siliceous sponge genus Hillendia, and is the type locality of the genus, and two fossil ammonite species, Subprionocyclus hitchinensis and Subprionocyclus branneri have been described from this site after being discovered there. It is shown on the Natural England Magic map as one of the \\"Geological places to visit\\". The site is located off a track leading from Hitchwood Lane to Hill End Farm Lane. It is difficult to find, but the site noticeboard is visible through a gap in the hedge on the left hand side of the track.

The cemetery was established in 1665, on land given by John Heseltine to the town of Bradford. The oldest readable marker in the cemetery has a date of 1689, but there are likely to be older burials. The cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. Description and history The Bradford Burial Ground is located southeast of the center of Bradford village, on the north side of Salem Street, a through road connecting Bradford to Georgetown. It is directly opposite Orchard Hill Road, and adjacent to the drive to the Bradford Swim Club. The land it occupies is roughly pentagonal in shape, and is fronted by a finished stone retaining wall, with a small flight if granite steps for access. The remaining sides of the cemetery are demarcated by fieldstone walls. The terrain is generally level but sloping gently downhill to the north, and is basically grass dotted with mature trees. Most of the graves are arranged in a generally east-facing orientation, but this is not always exact, and there is one row of graves that face north. The oldest graves are in the easternmost section. Although there are areas without any burial markers, ground-penetrating radar was used to identify at least 100 potential grave sites that lack markers. The most recent burials date to the 1950s. The cemetery was established in 1665 by the early founders of Bradford, which was incorporated in 1672, and was annexed to Haverhill in the 19th century. It was the site of the town's first two colonial meeting houses (whose locations within the grounds are not known). Documented burials include four of the town's first five ministers, many of its early settlers, and war veterans from King Philip's War (1675-78) to the American Civil War (1861–65). The stone wall at the front was built as part of a Works Progress Administration project in the 1930s. The cemetery is now formally cared for by the city of Haverhill, although most of its maintenance is performed by volunteers.

The species is solely known from the Middle Eocene Baltic amber deposits in the Baltic Sea region of Europe. The genus contains a total of thirteen extant species distributed across the northern hemisphere. History and classification Notoscyphus balticus is known from a solitary fossil gametophyte shoot which is an inclusion in a transparent chunk of Baltic amber. The amber specimen also contains several Fagaceae hairs and some partially decomposed wood bits. When the fossil was described it was part of the amber collections housed in the Geological-Palaeontological Institute and Museum Hamburg. The amber was recovered from fossil bearing rocks in the Baltic Sea region of Europe. Estimates of the age date between 37 million years old, for the youngest sediments and 48 million years old. This age range straddles the middle Eocene, ranging from near the beginning of the Lutetian to the beginning of the Pribonian. The holotype was first studied by a group of five researchers led by Jochen Heinrichs of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. The research group's 2015 type description for the species was published in the paleobotany journal Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology. The specific epithet balticus was coined as a reference to the origin location for the amber. Description The N. balticus specimen is a gametophyte shoot preserved from apex down to the rhizoids. Overall the gametophyte is long and at its widest. There are three bunches of rhizoids near the base of the shoot and growing to up to long. The rhizoids are unbranched and show a thin coating of fungal hyphae that possibly penetrate into the rhizoids. The leaves are attached to the stem in a succubous manner with the base of each leaf overlapping the leaf below it. The leaves are round in outline when they are small and as the size increases they become elliptic in overall outline. The leaves freely spread out from the stem and some curve upwards, while the underleaves are small to inconspicuous with an ovate to triangular shape.

Biography He studied classical philology and linguistics in Munich and Leipzig, and went to Athens in 1871 as a Latin teacher. From 1872–78 he was a lecturer in comparative literature at the University of Athens. Under the auspices of the Berlin Academy of Sciences, one of the predecessors to the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities went to the Peloponnese to study the Maniot and Tsakonian dialects. He did mostly archaeological work, except for his studies of Tsakonian while he was in the Peloponnese. In the summer of 1876 he worked for the Berlin Academy in Trebizond working on a study of the Pontic dialect, some of which he did himself, and some of which was done by Ioannis Pacharidis, a local orphan schoolboy who had been working for a merchant firm to support his family. Pacharidis was eventually imprisoned by Turkish authorities for suspected spying; Deffner and the Greek vice consul secured Pacharidis's release from gaol and helped him emigrate to Greece to complete his studies.Encyclopedia of the Hellenic World, \\"Pacharidis, Ioannis\\", available at , retrieved 5 July 2015 From 1877 to 1910, Deffner was the director of the National Library of Greece in Athens.Εγκυκλοπαίδεια Μείζονος Ελληνισμού, s.v.

At Methana he discovered an ancient stone throne, the \\"Throne of the Gods\\". His research findings are recorded in the Athens Communiqués. His photodocumentation from Methana is preserved at the German Archaeological Institute at Athens. Defner was an editor for the Archiv für mittel- und neugriechische philologie, a German-language journal on mediaeval and modern Greek studies; the Beiträge zur Kunde der indogermanischen Sprachen, an Indo- European studies journal founded by Balticist Adalbert Bezzenberger; and the German-Greek newspaper Νέα Ελλάς (Nea Ellas, \\"Greece News\\"). Deffner is an honorary citizen of Leonidio in the Peloponnese.Donauwörther Zeitung, 13.

Dr. Nicholas, also an electrical engineer, focused his doctoral research on electronic methods for analyzing the grammatical and syntactical structure of words and phrases in various languages, including his native Greek and its various dialects. This end, he conducted published and unpublished research in Tsakonian and other outlier Greek dialects, which present interesting problems in such analysis. This gave him a broad familiarity with the whole body of research on Tsakonian, including Deffner's work. In his critique, Nicholas notes that the criticisms of Deffner do not begin with him, but stretch back as far as Deffner's contemporary Hubert Pernot, who said that Deffner \\"has made a sea\\" of Tsakonian phonology. Nicholas notes that this is a term of not inconsiderable opprobrium in , lit. \\"he made things a sea\\", i.e. \\"he messed up\\"). Nicholas reserves special criticism for a children's tale, Πεντάμορφο του κόσμου. Παρανύθι για τα καμπζία Τhα Τσακώνικα γρούσσα (The Five-time Most Beautiful in the World. A fairy tale for children. In the Tsakonian language) a Snow White-like story composed in a somewhat eccentric variety of Tsakonian which Deffner submitted to several learned societies without explanation. Since Deffner never asserted that the story was an authentic Tsakonian folk- tale collected in the field, Nicholas does not go so far as to call Deffner a fraud, but he does criticize Deffner's lack of specificity on the matter and his submission of the story to academic journals without proper attribution, a scholarly lapse which he asserts is the academic equivalent of the Christian sin of blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, an unpardonable offense.Nicholas, Nick, PhD, Ἡλληνιστεύκοντος: An occasional blog on Greek linguistics (broadly meant), \\"Making Greek more googleable (through English)\\", \\"Michael Deffner:Scoundrel\\", , 26 April 2009, retrieved 5 July 2015 Deffner has also been criticized for exaggerated claims about the survival of the Ancient Greek infinitive in the Pontic Greek dialects into the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1977, Pontic-descended Greek linguist D.E. Tombaidis began a study of Christian Pontic Greek refugees living in Greece to see if he could find traces of an infinitive, which he himself had never heard among Pontic Greeks. He could find only one informant who could understand and use the infinitive, otherwise, the speakers used a subordinating particle combined with a third-person finite verb form, just like speakers of Standard Modern Greek. Not all refugee Pontic Greek speakers could assimilate rapidly to Standard Modern Greek, and decades later could still reproduce other distinctive Pontic forms, leading Tombaidis to conclude that the Christian Pontic infinitive was already moribund by the time the Christian Pontians were expelled from Asia Minor during the Population exchange between Greece and Turkey; this in turn led Tombaidis to conclude that Deffner was not a reliable source.Tombaidis, D.E. 1977. L'Infinitf dans le Dialecte Grec du Pont Euxin. Balkan Studies 18: 155–174. Tombaidis does not name the sole informant who was able to understand and produce the infinitive, but Nicholas believes that textual clues reveal the informant was Odysseas Lampsides, a Pontic historian whose own knowledge of the Pontic infinitive could have been contaminated by his knowledge of older forms of Pontic Greek and other older varieties of Greek.Nicholas, Nick, PhD,Ἡλληνιστεύκοντος: An occasional blog on Greek linguistics (broadly meant), \\"Making Greek more googleable (through English)\\", \\"Pontic Infinitives, Real and Imagined\\" , 23 January 2011, retrieved 5 July 2015 On the other hand, while the infinitive seems essentially extinct among Christian Pontians, there is evidence that the infinitive survives, in very restricted use, among the Muslim Romeye of Turkey, in their dialect Romeyka;Sitaridou, I.

He also painted landscapes and portraits, especially equestrian portraits.  Early life  Corn Stooks by Bray Church (1872) Heywood Hardy was born on 25 November 1842 at Chichester in Sussex, the youngest of ten children of the artist James Hardy senior (1801 – 1879) and his wife Elizabeth. Before he became an artist his father was Principal Trumpet in the Private Band of Music of King George IV. Other artists in the family included Heywood's elder brothers, James junior and David, his sister Ada and his cousins, Frederick Daniel Hardy and George Hardy. Heywood's ancestors were from Horsforth in Yorkshire; Gathorne Gathorne-Hardy, First Earl of Cranbrook, was his second cousin. When he was 17 years old Heywood Hardy left the family home in Bath after an argument with his quick-tempered father and removed to Keynsham near Bristol. His first two paintings, landscapes, were accepted for exhibition at The Royal Academy in 1864 In the same year he was appointed an Ensign in the 7th Somersetshire Rifle Volunteer Corps, a part-time position. Later that year he left Keynsham to study at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris where his principal teacher was Isidore Pils. Hardy spent much of his spare time copying paintings in the Louvre.Hardy (2016), p.71 After his years of bohemianism in Paris, Heywood returned to England via Antwerp and by 1869 was living at Goring in Oxfordshire, near the bridge over the Thames.  Animal painting  A Lion's Head (1878) In 1870 Hardy removed to St John's Wood in London and established himself as an animal painter.Hardy (2016), p.75 In 1873 The Times commented on his picture of fighting lions exhibited at The Royal Academy, \\"...we do not remember such a daring and determined piece of savage animal painting from an English hand – few from any hand since Rubens. The picture at once gives a great rise in artistic rank to the artist.\\" Hardy visited Egypt in 1873 to paint wildlife.Hardy (2016), p.86 In London he studied the comparative anatomy of animals and birds with Professor Alfred Henry Garrod, Head of the Scientific Department at the London Zoo.Hardy (2016), p.205 He also made illustrations for Garrod's research on the horse gait. To assist his studies of lions, Hardy acquired a lioness that had died at the London Zoo and had it mounted by Rowland Ward, one of the foremost taxidermists of his day.Hardy (2016) p.85  Horses and Equestrian portraits  Horses and horse riding were the subjects of much of Hardy’s later work. His pictures of horse riding by the seashore and riders in 18th century settings are among his most popular paintings. Hardy painted three winners of the Grand National for their owners.Hardy (2016), p.137 He was much in demand to paint equestrian portraits and pictures of the most famous Hunts and foxhounds of his day. Notable portraits include that of Lady Ida Sitwell; her husband Sir George Sitwell commissioned it as a wedding present. In 1909 Heywood Hardy returned to live in Sussex, at East Preston, a few minutes walk from the beach. His last paintings were altarpieces for the thirteenth century Church of St Mary at Clymping in Sussex and for St Luke’s Church at the Royal Hospital Haslar, Gosport. Hardy’s ashes were buried at Clymping Church.Hardy (2016), p.148 Heywood Hardy was a founder member of the Royal Society of Portrait Painters, a founder member of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers, a member of the Royal Institute of Oil Painters, and an Associate of the Royal Watercolour Society.Hardy (2016), pp.148-150 File:Duty.jpgDuty (1880) File:A Summer's Day in Cleveland.jpgA Summer's Day in Cleveland (1889) File:Out for a Scamper.jpgOut for a Scamper (ca. 1900)  Family and Music  Heywood's father was originally a musician and three uncles played in the Royal Private Band of Music, including his uncle William Hardy who was Conductor of Queen Adelaide’s Private Band.Hardy (2016), pp.199-204 Heywood played the zither, mandolin and English guitar. He often participated in musical evenings, as a singer and musician, in the country houses that he visited to paint portraits and pictures of horses and dogs.Hardy (2016), pp.151,152 In 1868 Hardy married Mary Beechey, daughter of Rear-Admiral Frederick William Beechey, FRS, President of the Royal Geographical Society. There were several artists in Mary’s family; her grandfather was the artist Sir William Beechey. Two of Hardy’s four daughters were artists. His eldest daughter, Nina, exhibited 15 paintings at the Royal Academy, mostly portraits of women and children.Graves (1905), p.389Hardy (2016), p.152 And Mabel Hardy, who was always known as “Beldy”, a blend of Mabel and Hardy, was an artist and musician who won first prize for her studies at the Paris Conservatory.

Summary  Kasukabe Girls' Senior High School, popularly known as Kasujo, operates according to a standard full-day system. It offers an ordinary education curriculum as well as a special foreign languages course. It one of the so-called Super English Language High Schools. Partnered with Ohio Northern University, the curriculum focuses on international relations.  History  * 1911 - Kasukabe City Girl's Technical High School opens * 1930 - Renamed Kasukabe Girls' Senior High School * 1948 - Re-established as Kasukabe Girls' Senior High School with license from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology * 1996 - Foreign Languages program established * 2010 - Celebration of the school's 100-year anniversary  School song  The song, which has two verses, is played at school functions to the accompaniment of a mandolin guitar group. The first verse centres on filial piety and the second, on the teacher-student relationship. In the period leading up to and during the Second World War, there was a third verse in between the current two, which described the duty to a sovereign emperor. It was taken out in the post-war era. *Before and during World War 2 1st verse: filial piety 2nd verse: duty and worship of emperor 3rd verse: teacher-student relationship *Post- war 1st verse: filial piety 2nd verse: teacher-student relationship Facilities School facilities include the Foreign Language Annex, the Sunflower Building and the Sunflower Assembly Hall. The home-room classes, classroom facilities, as well as admission exams for the Foreign Language Curriculum classes are all in the Foreign Language Annex. However, ordinary curriculum students also use the annex from time to time. Essentially a small gymnasium, the Sunflower Building houses, physical education classes as well as club activities such as kendo and badminton. It also serves as a place of refuge in the case of disaster both for students and the local neighbourhood. In case residents need to stay overnight, showers have been installed. The Sunflower Assembly Hall is usually used as a cultural centre. On the first floor are cultural club activity rooms, student council rooms, a cafeteria, a laundry room, and baths. On the second floor are more cultural club activity rooms (not including woodwind and music clubs), and sleeping rooms for extended training sessions. These sleeping rooms, in addition to the koto club room and the cafeteria room, are also used by the sports clubs as extended training session lodging. There is a two-storey building in the corner of the school grounds which was formerly used as extended training accommodation. It is used for woodwinds club activities as well as by the kyūdō (archery) club as a site for making udon noodles for the annual school cultural festival. School events *First term Ball sports meet School excursion *Summer holidays Overseas study trip *Second term Culture festival Sports festival Marathon meet (in Watarase Basin) *Third term Farewell party Culture and sports festival *Nine triads of three classes, each representing one of the three school years, compete with one another during the festival. Because there are 10 classes in each of the second and third year cohorts, two classes have to combine to form nine groups. *With the exception of the Culture Festival Committee and the Student Council, each competitive group member wears a T-shirt that the group designed for the occasion. Visitors during the festival vote for the most popular T-shirt design. *Similarly, each group makes up their own \\"group dance\\" which they perform and is voted on by visitors. *In both the culture and sports festivals, the school principal encourages participation with the \\"Kasujo call\\", a distinctive, traditional school cheer. *Because the culture and sports festivals occur at the same time, as a pair they are referred to as the Kasujo festival. Ball sports meet *Similar to the above-mentioned Culture and Sports Festivals, different classes and school groups compete with one another. The sports include handball, volleyball, soft tennis, badminton, and dodge ball. Ball sport club members cannot compete in their club sport. Marathon meet *Previously called the \\"Power Walking Meet\\", in 2007 the name was changed to the \\"Marathon Meet\\". *During the training, if the student does not meet the 20 km (or sometimes 30 km) quota, they will not be allowed to continue training after the Marathon Meet. However, according to the weather, teacher availability, and other factors affecting the training, some students will be allowed to fulfil their quota after the Meet. Because of this flexibility, barring extreme circumstances, the vast majority of students can fulfil their quota. *During the Marathon Meet, each student should run 8 km within 1 hour and 20 minutes. In the middle of the course, at the 4 km mark, teachers organise a water refreshment station. *Although the time limit is usually sufficient, students who do not achieve 8 km can make it up after school during the week of the Meet.  Transport  The nearest railway station to the school is Kasukabe Station on the Tobu Skytree Line and the Tobu Urban Park Line, approximately 17 minutes away on foot.

It sits on a low hillock overlooking the N81, 2 km south of Hollywood. Description The stone circle sits on the end of a low ridge, enclosed at a distance by high ground on all sides. It is thought that someone attempted to remove the circle unsuccessfully, disturbing the stones placement in the process. Now the site is composed of 16 granite boulders, with 5 remaining in their original placements. In the Ordnance Survey of 1941 reported 29 stones originally. The stones range in height from 1.3 m to 1.92 m. There has been no archaeological investigation of the site, so the construction date is only estimated to be from the late Bronze Age, approximately 1400–500 BCE. The circle is roughly 23 m in diameter. An outlying larger stone, 2 m in height, stands outside the circle to the north east. Some of the stones show signs of degraded carved megalithic art, consisting of grooves and cup-marks. History The stone's name, The Piper's Stones, is believed to have derived from a local folk tale that said those caught dancing there on a Sunday would turn to stone, with the stones representing such revellers. An outlying stone on the north east represents the piper. There is an old hawthorn tree growing around the stone's circumference, this tree is associated with fairies and other folklore. There are four other circles that have been given the same name, another in County Wicklow, two in County Kildare, and one more in County Kerry. These others also have a similar folk tale associated with them, and has been seen as a way of classifying such circles. Access The site is sign-posted, and there is parking on a hard-shoulder.

On June 13, 2015, it was announced that due to the eviction of the Whalers, a new team called the Stateline Whalers would play the 2015–16 season at the Brewster Ice Arena under former Danbury Whalers CEO and managing partner Herm Sorcher. The team was announced as being owned by Barry Soskin, who also owns the Port Huron Prowlers and Danville Dashers and formerly the Dayton Demonz. The Danbury Whalers were officially considered to be on hiatus for the season by the FHL, but gave up their naming and territorial rights to the new Brewster team. On June 27, it was reported that the FHL had approved of a new team in Danbury, Connecticut, to replace the now departed Whalers. Local businessmen Bruce Bennett and Edward Crowe were announced as the ownership group. Bennett announced the new team as the Danbury Titans. On July 15, during the Titans' inaugural booster club meeting, the ownership confirmed that the league had re-organized and they would also own the new Brewster team (which had formerly announced as the Stateline Whalers and signed a lease for the Brewster Ice Arena) and Barry Soskin would no longer be involved in Brewster. On July 18, Bennett announced the team would be called the Brewster Bulldogs and that neither of his teams (the Bulldogs and Titans) would have any connection with the former Whalers. The team failed to make the playoffs in the six-team league after the 2015–16 regular season. In June 2016 after their inaugural season ended, owner Bruce Bennett announced that he had given up operating the team to focus on managing the Danbury Titans.

Sponsored by The Portland Mercury and two cannabis companies, the event was attended by an estimated 1,500–2,000 people, who were provided up to seven grams of marijuana for immediate consumption or to take home. Organizers complied with restrictions on recreational sales by distributing free cannabis and required attendees to pay an entry fee. More than 1,300 tickets were sold, but the building's 500-person capacity meant long wait times to enter. Media outlets reported on the historic nature of the event, which was described as a \\"stoner's paradise\\" and a celebration of freedom. Background and planning \\"Weed the People: A Cannabis Legalization Celebration\\", or simply \\"Weed the People\\", was held two days after recreational marijuana became legal in Oregon. The Burnside Burn, which was organized by Portland NORML and held on the Burnside Bridge starting at midnight on July 1, 2015, preceded the event. \\"Weed the People\\" was sponsored by the local alternative weekly newspaper The Portland Mercury and two cannabis businesses—The C02 Company and Oregon's Cannabis Concierge. It was produced by Connie Wohn, who said enthusiasm and demand were high. The event sold out quickly (by June 24–26), and there was a waiting list with 750 additional interested participants. The Mercury cannabis correspondent Josh Taylor, who organized \\"Weed the People\\", said the event \\"celebrates the throwing off of oppression and the freedom of legalization\\". Referring to the observance of Independence Day on July 4, he said: \\"And now, people can watch the fireworks tomorrow while high. They were probably going to do that anyway, but we're just helping them along.\\" According to Wohn, event organizers were prepared and met with \\"any agency that could've had any sort of recourse or legal ramification on this event\\". The Portland Police Bureau \\"gave it their blessing\\" and did not have a large presence. Security guards were hired to perform bag searches and enforce a ban on outside alcohol and cannabis consumption. The promotional poster for \\"Weed the People\\" had patriotic imagery depicting an eagle carrying a stem of marijuana leaves in one talon and several joints in the other. Event The alcohol-free celebration, believed to be the \\"first formal event with free cannabis giveaways\\", took place from 2:00–9:00 pm at Metal Craft Fabrication (or MCF Craft Brewing Systems), a former craft brewery and industrial building in the North Portland section of Eliot. Between 1,500 and 2,000 participants were supplied with up to seven grams of marijuana, which they could consume openly at the event or take home. Organizers complied with a temporary limit on recreational sales by distributing free cannabis and had attendees pay a $40 entry fee. Most attendees were from the Portland metropolitan area, but residence in Oregon was not required; some attendees were from as far away as Idaho and Michigan. Inside the venue there were cannabis plants, a lounge (or \\"chill out area\\") with seating and music, smoking devices, cannabis and food vendors, and a \\"Grow Garden\\" where attendees picked up their free samples; out back was a fenced-in yard with an on-site taco truck. Guests also had the opportunity to meet farmers and producers from local businesses and dispensaries. \\"Weed the People\\" had a few complications: organizers sold 1,336 tickets and were prepared to supply enough product for all attendees, but the building's capacity was 500, resulting in long entry lines. Hot temperatures both inside and outside the building resulted in at least two people fainting and a visit from the local fire department for medical treatment. However, people were reportedly patient as they waited in lines. There were no personal disputes during the event, and there were enough cannabis products for all attendees. Commentary Jamie Hales of The Oregonian called the event \\"historic\\" and \\"a veritable stoner's paradise\\", writing: > In a city where recreational marijuana events have struggled just to get off > the ground, Weed the People represented an effort that, while it had its > issues, was unprecedented ... In cities around the country, carrying around > seven grams of cannabis can mean serious jail time. In Portland on Friday, > it was a cause for celebration ... It meant freedom to consume a drug people > many had already been consuming, it meant freedom from fear of arrest for > doing so, it meant the opportunity to smoke, to eat and to vaporize freely—a > freedom many in Oregon will be exercising enthusiastically. Willamette Week Martin Cizmar said the event was described as a \\"shitshow\\" on social media, and believed \\"Weed the People\\" was a financial success. KATU's Reed Andrews described the event as the \\"first of its kind\\" and said it \\"is testing the limits for what's legal when it comes to marijuana in Oregon\\". Sam Catherman of The State Column described the event as \\"a gathering that connected entrepreneurs and enthusiasts who were excited about the burgeoning industry in their state\\". The Stranger Christopher Frizzelle ended his reporting on the event with, \\"Happy freedom day, everyone. What a country.\\" Keegan Hamilton of Vice News described the event as a \\"veritable weed Disneyland\\" and \\"a celebration of newfound freedom\\". He added: \\"More than just giving Oregon residents and visitors the opportunity to exercise their new legal right to get high, 'Weed the People' illustrated how vast the market is for marijuana and related products, and how strange it is that the drug is now technically legal to possess but illegal to procure for people who haven't received authorization from a doctor.\\" References External links * Weed the People: A Cannabis Legalization Celebration! at Bold Type Tickets * Weed the People Portland—A Cannabis Legalization Celebration! at Facebook * Hurry!

In the episode of American Masters about Hank's like, singer Billy Walker explained, \\"Billie Jean was Faron Young's girlfriend. Faron had just moved to Nashville. Billie Jean and Faron was out clubbin' around and Hank Williams joined them. And they went to the lavatory and Hank pulled out a gun on Faron and said, \\"Boy, this is gonna be my girlfriend from now on.\\" In the same film, Ray Price, who shared an apartment with Williams, recalls Hank using Billie Jean as leverage to try and win back his ex-wife Audrey Williams: \\"He told Audrey, 'If you don't come back to me I'm gonna marry Billie Jean.' Well, Audrey said, 'Go ahead.'\\" Williams cut the song at his last recording session in Nashville at Castle Studio with Fred Rose producing. By this point, the singer had been fired from the Grand Ole Opry for drunkenness and had returned to Shreveport to play the Louisiana Hayride. Although he was in terminal decline, the quality of the songs Williams recorded at his final session was astonishing: \\"I Could Never Be Ashamed of You,\\" \\"Take These Chains From My Heart,\\" \\"Kaw-Liga,\\" and \\"Your Cheatin' Heart.\\" As biographer Colin Escott marvels, \\"Most singers hope to hang their careers on one or two classics; Hank cut four classics between 1:30 and 3:40 on the afternoon of September 23, 1952...\\" Williams was backed by Tommy Jackson (fiddle), Don Helms (steel guitar), Chet Atkins (lead guitar), Jack Shook (rhythm guitar), and Floyd \\"Lightnin'\\" Chance (bass). A demo version of Williams singing the song with just his guitar, likely recorded in 1951, is also available.

It uses perfectly cut, completely regular squared stone blocks of equal height, and sometimes of the same length. Etymology opus, work + isodomum, analogous to isodomon, where iso- = equal Overview In classical antiquity this technique was perfected and widely used, especially for public buildings (temples, theaters, amphitheaters etc.). One of the most well-known examples is the Parthenon.Müller / Vogel 1999, 3, 31, 60, 61 Vitruvius briefly described this technique in his De architectura, 2nd book, 8th chapter as following: \\"A wall is called 'isodomum' when all the courses are of equal height\\". Vitruvius further states that the stone blocks of opus isodomum are bound together by mortar, but more often they are not connected with mortar but with metal ties such as iron cramps, fixed in stone blocks with molten lead. Completely regular isodomum is relatively rare, especially in the provinces. More frequent is isodomum made of stone blocks of the same height but not of the same length. In order to strengthen this type of wall, builders always take good care that the ends of stone blocks in alternating courses of the wall do not match.Suić 1976, 110 Opus pseudoisodomum is a version of opus isodomum mentioned by Vitruvius, describing that it is a kind of stonemasonry in which \\"the rows of courses do not match but run unequally\\", referring to the height and length of the blocks, which are nevertheless still perfectly cut.

Life Born on Barbados on 2 November 1819, he was eldest son of General Sackville Hamilton Berkeley, colonel of the 16th Regiment of Foot, and his wife Elizabeth Pilgrim, daughter of William Murray of Bruce Vale Estate, Barbados. Educated at Trinity College, Dublin, which he entered on 3 July 1837, he graduated B.A. in 1842, and soon returned to the West Indies, where his active life was almost wholly passed. On 11 February 1845 Berkeley was appointed colonial secretary and controller of customs of British Honduras, and ex-officio member of the executive and legislative councils. While still serving there, he was chosen in 1860–1 to administer temporarily the government of Dominica, and on 8 July 1864 was appointed lieutenant-governor of Saint Vincent. During his tenure of office, in 1867, an Act to amend and simplify the legislature substituted a single legislative chamber for the two houses which had been in existence since 1763. Berkeley was acting administrator of Lagos from December 1872 to October 1873, when he was appointed governor in chief of the West Africa settlements (Sierra Leone, Gambia, Gold Coast, and Lagos). The Gold Coast and Lagos were soon made into a separate colony (24 July 1874); Berkeley was recalled, and a new governor of Sierra Leone and Gambia was appointed. While he was on his way home in June 1874, he was offered, and accepted, the government of Western Australia; but then did not take up the appointment, being sent instead to the Leeward Islands as governor in chief. There he remained until 27 June 1881, when he retired on a pension. Berkeley was created C.M.G. on 20 February 1874, and K.C.M.G. 24 May 1881. He died unmarried in London on 29 September 1905, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.

The squadron flies the Boeing E-6B Mercury airborne command post and communications relay aircraft. It is part of the U.S. Navy's TACAMO community, whose mission is to enable the President of the United States and the Secretary of Defense to directly communicate with U.S. submarines, bombers, and missile silos during a nuclear war. Operations VQ-4 has a complement of 78 officers and 426 enlisted personnel. Since 1992, it has operated under Navy Strategic Communications Wing 1 at Tinker Air Force Base. It deploys aircraft to fly operational patrols out of NAS Patuxent River, Maryland. The acronym \\"TACAMO\\" stands for \\"TAke Charge And Move Out\\", supposedly the first operational directive given to the squadron at its inception. History The TACAMO mission began in 1961 as a test program to determine if an airborne Very Low Frequency (VLF) communications system was feasible. Weapons Systems Test Division conducted this program, using a U.S. Marine Corps KC-130 aircraft as a test vehicle. The overwhelming success of the test program prompted funding for the first production aircraft. The project was designated TACAMO, which stands for Take Charge and Move Out.\\" In order to avoid long lead-time delays, four U. S. Air Force C-130 aircraft were taken from the production line in early 1963. After extensive modification, the aircraft was designated a C-130G. The first of these aircraft, BUNO 151890, was delivered on 26 December 1963. At that time, the communications equipment consisted of removable vans that could be installed in a matter of hours. Plans were formulated in 1966 to expand the TACAMO Program. The expansion included permanently installing the communications suites in eight aircraft and their designation as EC-130Qs. On 1 July 1968, VQ-4 was established at NAS Patuxent River, MD as a permanent operational squadron. In 1974, the next major aircraft modification incorporated a new power amplifier, a dual trailing wire antenna system and a high-speed reel system for deploying and retracting of the trailing wire antennas. Additional improvements included satellite communications and an enhanced VLF capability. In the 1980s, it was recognized that the C-130s, in some cases the oldest in the fleet, were in need of replacement. The hunt was on for the successor to “The Mighty Herc.” Eventually, the B707-320 airframe was chosen, modified extensively and designated the E-6A. The Navy E-6s were the last 16 aircraft to roll off of Boeing’s venerable 707 line after 30 years of production. On 25 January 1991, VQ-4 took delivery of its first E-6A Mercury aircraft and in November 1992, changed homeport to Tinker AFB, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. On 20 September 1999, VQ-4 took delivery of its first E-6B. The E-6B contains upgraded systems that enable it to perform the USSTRATCOM Airborne Command Post (ABNCP) “Looking Glass” mission. Upgrades include: a Battle staff module to provide enhanced command, control and communications for the Nation’s nuclear arsenal; the Airborne Launch Control System to permit airborne launch and control of ICBMs; UHF C3 Radio Subsystem; Digital Airborne Intercommunications Switching System; MILSTAR Airborne Terminal System (Satellite communications) and a High Power Transmit Set for enhanced communications. Since its commissioning, VQ-4 evolved into a Squadron of approximately 400 Officers and Enlisted personnel making it one of the largest operational aviation squadrons in the Navy. Indeed, their extraordinary dedication to operational excellence resulted in the Squadron surpassing 42 years and 380,000 flight hours of Class A mishap- free operations.

From 1968, the squadron first operated the EC-130G Hercules aircraft, a specially modified radio relay version of the Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft. It was based at both NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, and NAS Agana, Guam. In the late 1970s, the squadron based at NAS Agana relocated to NAS Barbers Point, Hawaii. In the mid 1980s, the squadron based at NAS Patuxent River began receiving EC-130Q aircraft, transferring the older EC-130G aircraft to the squadron based at Barbers Point. Both squadrons transitioned to the E-6A Hermes in 1991–92, and co-located at Tinker Air Force Base in 1992.

It subsequently featured in live sets before being recorded for the Closer sessions. As with most other Joy Division songs, it was written by jamming in their practice room. Bassist Peter Hook and guitarist Bernard Sumner swapped instruments when writing and recording the track; according to Hook, they \\"were bored writing on our instruments so we just thought let's swap. Barney played bass and I played guitar. I was nowhere as proficient a guitarist as him, mind you, but I liked the way it sounds. Great riff, great bass too.\\" Hannett's production has been highly praised, with Pitchfork describing it as \\"sepulchral\\". However, as with their debut album Unknown Pleasures, both Hook and Sumner were unhappy with Hannett's work. Hook said that the track was mixed on one of his days off, and when he heard the final product was disappointed that the abrasiveness of his guitar part had been laden with effects and toned down. He wrote; \\"I was like, head in hands, 'Oh fucking hell, it's happening again. Unknown Pleasures number two...Martin [Hannett] had fucking melted the guitar with his Marshall Time Waster. Made it sound like someone strangling a cat and, to my mind, absolutely killed the song. I was so annoyed with him and went in and gave him a piece of my mind but he just turned round and told me to fuck off\\". Song The track, especially Stephen Morris's tribal drum pattern, seems influenced by krautrock band Can. According to Raggett, \\"Morris's drumming has more than a little off-kilter pound and swing to things, while instead of the dramatic foregrounding of those beats he so often does, Martin Hannett pushes them a bit back in the mix, strong but a bit subordinate\\". The Northern Irish alternative metal band Therapy? used many musical elements of the song on their cover of another Joy Division song, \\"Isolation\\".

Life  Richard Mohaupt was born in Breslau, where he studied music. After his studies he worked as a répétiteur and music director in Breslau, Aachen and Weimar and after a concert tour through the Soviet Union he finally moved to Berlin in 1932. Four years later he had his first success with his ballet Die Gaunerstreiche der Courasche. The work was performed during the ballet festival which was part of the supporting programme of the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. But shortly after this success the Nazis denounced him with the expression \\"Music Bolshevism\\" and he was excluded from the Reichsmusikkammer. With this exclusion Richard Mohaupt could not work in Germany anymore and so emigrated to the US in 1939 and settled in New York. In the US, Mohaupt did not compose musical theatre anymore because symphonic music sold much better. That led to the composition of his most famous work, the Town Piper Music, which was performed worldwide in the 1950s. During his time in the United States he mainly composed for film, television and radio. His works were performed by renowned orchestras like the New York Philharmonic and the NBC Symphony Orchestra. He also composed operas at that time but mainly for German opera houses, among them were Max und Moritz (1949). In 1955 Richard Mohaupt moved back to Europe and lived in Austria until his death. He died in Reichenau an der Rax before the world premiere of his last opera, Der grüne Kakadu (with words by Arthur Schnitzler).

The album is notable for its inclusion of the hit single \\"Gonna Fly Now (Theme from \\"Rocky\\")\\". Background and production After the experience of creating Primal Scream without his touring band, Ferguson was determined to see them become an integral part of his next effort. While Bob James was firmly in control of the production, Ferguson was insistent that his band members would be a part of the proceedings. It became a bi-coastal effort, with the touring band recording in San Francisco between dates, and the James crew recording in New York. Two of the songs were recorded entirely in New York without any participation by Ferguson's band: the themes from Star Trek and Rocky. \\"Gonna Fly Now\\" While Ferguson was known to have an uncanny ability to change with the times, no one suspected that in the Spring of 1977, he would pull off the coup of his life. As AllMusic reviewer Richard Ginell put it: \\"Maynard was shrewd, and Maynard was quick, and he managed to beat almost everyone to the punch...\\" It had been decades since a big band recording had made the charts, but when he released his recording ahead of the soundtrack version, Ferguson scored the biggest hit of his long career. The recording had a 13-week run on Billboard's Hot 100 chart, eventually peaking at number 28 on June 25. It's likely that Ferguson's recording paved the way for the success of the soundtrack version (Bill Conti's own recording would peak at number one the following week). Gonna Fly Now is also unique in that it had recordings by four different artists charting at the same time (Ferguson, Conti, Rhythm Heritage and Current). Critical reception Conquistador was the most successful album of Ferguson's career, earning him his first and only gold record, and a Grammy nomination (Best Pop Instrumental Performance) for \\"Gonna Fly Now (Theme from \\"Rocky\\")\\". Boosted by the popularity of the single, Conquistador not only went to number one on the Jazz charts, but it became the first big band album to appear on the pop charts in decades, sparking a revival of interest in big band music. When Conquistador rose to number 22 on the pop album charts, noted Los Angeles Times music critic Leonard Feather noted \\"Conquistador earned Ferguson a unique place in the big band world: he alone was able to crack the pop charts.\\" Reissues In 2003, Conquistador was reissued by Columbia/Legacy along with 1974's Chameleon, both with remastered sound and new essays. Trivia Maynard Ferguson's arrangement of \\"Gonna Fly Now\\" was used for the opening of the Toronto newscast CityPulse from the early 1980s into the 1990s (with newer arrangements keeping the same melody used until the mid 2000s). Maynard Ferguson's arrangement of \\"Theme from Star Trek\\" was used as the opening for The Larry King Show talk radio program on the Mutual Radio Network, focusing on the recording improvisations rather than the main melody, although the piece in full could be heard on occasion at the close of his program. Jay Chattaway who produced the album and worked on most the arrangements on the album would go on to compose music scores for Star Trek: The Next Generation and its respected spinoffs; Deep Space Nine and Voyager, along with the prequel Enterprise.

The Mission, headed by a former British cabinet minister Lord Runciman, was sent to mediate in a dispute between the Government of Czechoslovakia and the Sudeten German Party (SdP), representing the radicalised ethnic German minority within the country. The British mediators were active on the ground in Czechoslovakia during the late summer, issuing their report shortly before the Munich Conference in September. Background Districts in Czechoslovakia with an ethnic German population of 25% or more (pink), 50% or more (red), and 75 % or more (dark red) according to the census of 1930.Statistický lexikon obcí v Republice československé I. Země česká, Prague, 1934 and Statistický lexikon obcí v Republice československé II. Země moravskoslezská, Prague, 1935. The crisis in Czechoslovakia arose from demands for territorial autonomy (and probable eventual secession) for the predominantly German-speaking areas located mainly along the western borders of Czechoslovakia, known as the Sudetenland. These territories and their population of over 3 million ethnic Germans, historically parts of Bohemia within the Habsburg Empire, had been included in Czechoslovakia, largely for strategic and economic reasons, at the formation of the state in 1918.Perman, D., The Shaping of the Czechoslovak State: Diplomatic History of the Boundaries of Czechoslovakia, 1914–1920, Leiden, 1962, pp. 125–36. Following Adolf Hitler’s rise to power in neighbouring Germany in 1933, the German minority population within Czechoslovakia, radicalised by economic hardship and propaganda, turned to the SdP – which emulated the Nazis across the border.Wiskemann, Elizabeth, Czechs and Germans: A Study of the Struggle in the Historic Provinces of Bohemia and Moravia, 2nd edn., London, 1967, pp. 197–206. In April 1938, the party leader, Konrad Henlein, demanded not only full administrative autonomy for the German areas but also the right to practice National Socialism within them.Eight demands by Konrad Henlein, Carlsbad, 24 April 1938, Documents on German Foreign Policy, 1918–1945, Series D, vol. 2, London, 1950, no. 135. Earlier, in March 1938, during a meeting with Hitler in Berlin, Henlein was instructed to keep tension high by continuing to make demands of the Czechoslovak authorities but to avoid reaching a settlement with them.Henlein’s report on meeting with Hitler, 28 March 1938, Documents on German Foreign Policy, 1918–1945, Series D, vol. 2, London, 1950, no. 107. The secret plan of preparation for the invasion of Czechoslovakia, “Case Green”, was set for completion by 1 October 1938.Directive for Operation “Green”, Berlin, 30 May 1938, Documents on German Foreign Policy, 1918–1945, Series D, vol. 2, London, 1950, no. 221 Negotiations Lord Runciman and his small teamIn addition to Runciman himself and Ashton-Gwatkin (a Foreign Office official), who acted as chief-of- staff, the Mission comprised, Robert Stopford (a banker with experience of international financial negotiations), Ian Henderson (a former British Consul at Innsbruck), Geoffrey Peto (a former Conservative Member of Parliament and parliamentary aid to Runciman), David Stephens (a parliamentary official), with secretarial provision by Rosemary Miller and Aline Tillard. Basil Newton, the British Minister in Prague, was also, in effect, part of the team. Hilda Runciman (a former Liberal Member of Parliament) accompanied her husband in a private capacity. [Vyšný, Paul, The Runciman Mission to Czechoslovakia, 1938: Prelude to Munich, Palgrave Macmillan, Basingstoke, 2003, pp. 128–33.] arrived in Prague on 2 and 3 August 1938. Although ostensibly independent of the British Government, a key member of the Mission was Frank Ashton-Gwatkin, technically on secondment from his official duties at the London Foreign Office.Vyšný, Paul, The Runciman Mission to Czechoslovakia, 1938: Prelude to Munich, Basingstoke, 2003, pp. 128–30. Separate negotiations were held with the Czechoslovak Government and the SdP with a view to achieving a mediated settlement of the dispute. During meetings with the Czechoslovak President, Edvard Beneš, and other government officials, Runciman repeatedly pressed for significant concessions be made to the SdP. Runciman also met Henlein on several occasions but did not subject him to the same pressure for an agreement.Vyšný, Paul, The Runciman Mission to Czechoslovakia, 1938: Prelude to Munich, Basingstoke, 2003, pp. 243–60. The Czechoslovak Government initially resisted the SdP demand for full autonomy of the German areas but, under intense diplomatic pressure from Britain and France (Czechoslovakia’s principal allyLukes, Igor, Czechoslovakia between Stalin and Hitler: The Foreign Policy of Edvard Beneš in the 1930s, New York, 1996, p. 34.), Beneš conceded the point in the so-called 'Fourth Plan' – in effect, calling the bluff of the SdP.Message from Hencke to the Foreign Ministry, Prague, 8 September 1938, Documents on German Foreign Policy, 1918–1945, Series D, vol. 2, London, 1950, nos. 441 and 442. This development caused the SdP to break off contacts with the Czechoslovak authorities and led to an increase of unrest in the German areas. The situation was further exacerbated by a bellicose speech from Hitler on September 12 which triggered an uprising in the Sudeten territories. Decisive action by the Czechoslovak authorities restored order and the SdP leadership fled to Germany.Smelser, Ronald M., The Sudeten Problem, 1933–1938: Volkstumspolitik and the Formulation of Nazi Foreign Policy, Folkestone, 1975, pp. 237–40. In this atmosphere of rising international tension in Central Europe, Runciman was summoned back to London on 16 September to brief ministers. The following day he informed a meeting of the Cabinet that, in his view, ‘’Czechoslovakia could not continue to exist as she was today’’ and some territory would have to be ceded to Germany, even if \\"no more than cutting off certain fringes\\". Other solutions – including the use of a plebiscite for the German areas, the creation of an independent Sudeten-German state, the calling of a four-power conference, the federalisation of Czechoslovakia or the implementation of a variant of Benes’s ‘Fourth Plan’ – Runciman now considered impractical.Minutes of Cabinet meeting on 17 September 1938, Cabinet 39 (38), CAB 23/95, National Archives, London. Visiting Hitler Towards the end of August, the lack of progress in negotiations in Czechoslovakia, accompanied by signs of increasing belligerence in Nazi Germany, prompted the British Government to seek direct contact with Hitler. The initial idea was for Runciman to undertake the task.Message from Halifax to Runciman, 25 August 1938, Documents on British Foreign Policy, 1919–1939, Third Series, vol. 2, London, 1949, no. 686. He, however, resolutely refused to do so. Arguing that it would compromise the independence of his Mission (and also on account of suffering ill health in the late summer heat in Prague), he declared: “I am just not going to do it!”Stopford, R.J., Prague 1938–1939, p. 34, unpublished memoir, Stopford Papers, RJS 2/1, Imperial War Museum, London. Runciman’s refusal resulted in the Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, developing plans for the dramatic step of himself flying to Germany to meet Hitler at Berchtesgaden on 15 September.Notes by Chamberlain of conversation with Hitler at Berchtesgaden on 15 September 1938, Documents on British Foreign Policy, 1919–1939, Third Series, vol. 2, London, 1949, no. 895. Report The report of the Runciman Mission, in the form of letters to the British and Czechoslovak prime ministers dated 21 September 1938, was strongly hostile in tone towards the Czechoslovak Government and recommended the immediate transfer of the mainly German-inhabited territories to Germany. The 2000-word report placed the responsibility for the breakdown in negotiations very firmly on the SdP leadership who used the pretext of civil unrest in some German areas to sever contacts. The report also noted that Beneš’s 'Fourth Plan' proposals met “almost all the requirements” of the SdP’s demands. Nevertheless, when itemising the grievances of the German minority, Runciman expressed his sympathy for the Sudeten case observing that it was “a hard thing to be ruled by an alien race”. Although declaring that Czech rule was “not actively oppressive, and certainly not ‘terroristic’”, the report alleged “it was marked by tactlessness, lack of understanding, petty intolerance and discrimination”. Letter from Runciman to Beneš, 21 September 1938, Documents on British Foreign Policy, 1919–1939, Third Series, vol. 2, London, 1949, appendix II, pp. 675–9. The issues complained of, in addition to the electoral system in which the SdP could be outvoted in parliament, included the appointment of Czech officials in German areas, Czech farmers moving into these areas and Czech schools being built for their children, discrimination in favour of Czech firms in government contracts and Czechs receiving preferential economic relief. Runciman was highly critical of the Czechoslovak authorities for failing to provide adequate remedies for these perceived injustices. This failure, he noted, resulted in a feeling of ”hopelessness” amongst the German population but the “rise of Nazi Germany” gave them “new hope”, adding: “I regard their turning for help towards their kinsmen and their eventual desire to join the Reich as a natural development in the circumstances.” Foreseeing the danger of increased violence and even “civil war”, Runciman considered that the “frontier districts should at once be transferred from Czechoslovakia to Germany”, without recourse to a plebiscite which would be a “sheer formality”. Amongst other measures the report proposed the neutralisation of the remainder of Czechoslovakia and an international guarantee of its security.Letter from Runciman to Beneš, 21 September 1938, Documents on British Foreign Policy, 1919–1939, Third Series, vol. 2, London, 1949, appendix II, pp. 675–9. The report ostensibly provided the evidential basis for the proposals made by Chamberlain during his second meeting with Hitler at Bad Godesberg on 22 September. These proposal involved the transfer to Germany of those districts in Czechoslovakia with a majority German population.Notes of conversation between Chamberlain and Hitler at Godesberg on 22 September 1938, Documents on British Foreign Policy, 1919–1939, Third Series, vol. 2, London, 1949, no. 1033. Archival evidence suggests that the report was revised at a late stage, probably by Ashton-Gwatkin, in order to bring the document fully into line with British policy. The original draft of the report proposed the transfer of some territory, though the extent of the area concerned is open to question.Bruegel, J.W., Czechoslovakia Before Munich: The German Minority Problem and British Appeasement Policy, Cambridge, 1973, pp. 275–6.Vyšný, Paul, The Runciman Mission to Czechoslovakia, 1938: Prelude to Munich, Basingstoke, 2003, pp. 344–9. However, when previously addressing the Cabinet on 17 September, Runciman indicated that he had in mind the specific possibility of transferring the areas with high concentrations of German inhabitants around the towns of Cheb and Aš, in the extreme west of the country. Minutes of Cabinet meeting on 17 September 1938, Cabinet 39 (38), CAB 23/95, National Archives, London. Reactions Runciman’s activities in Czechoslovakia were eagerly followed by a large international press corps, some of whom, in the course of their reporting, were critical of the use of his leisure time. The 67-year-old mediator (who was accompanied in Czechoslovakia by his wife, Hilda) spent most of his weekends relaxing in the company of the Sudeten German aristocracy, many of whom were supporters of the SdP.Runciman’s stay in Czechoslovakia extended over six weekends, five of which were spent on the estates of the German aristocracy, located mostly in areas where he was exposed to the influence of the SdP. Only one of his hosts, Zdeněk Kinský, at Žďár in Moravia, was openly supportive of the Czechoslovak government. The other weekends were spent with Ulrich Kinsky near Česká Kamenice, Adolf Schwarzenberg at Český Krumlov, Clary-Aldringen at Teplice and Eugen Czernin at Petersburg. In addition, the estate of Max Hohenlohe, near Chomutov, who acted as the Mission’s go-between with the SdP leadership, served as the venue for Runciman's meetings with Henlein. [Glassheim, Eagle, Noble Nationalists: The Transformation of the Bohemian Aristocracy, Cambridge, Mass., 2005, pp. 178–86.] These activities were arranged at the behest of the SdP with the aim of exposing the mediator to a social milieu favourable to their cause. Despite his rejection of the criticism, Runciman’s claim of impartiality became severely compromised in the eyes of many. Vyšný, Paul, The Runciman Mission to Czechoslovakia, 1938: Prelude to Munich, Basingstoke, 2003, pp. 330–3. Following the publication of the Runciman report on 28 September, the American journalist Dorothy Thompson drew attention to a perceived internal inconsistency in the document, terming it “illogical”. She also expressed the suspicion that the report was “made to order to fit the agreement” reached between Hitler and Chamberlain at Berchtesgaden and was a “piece of propaganda”.New York Herald Tribune, 1 and 3 October 1938. Ashton- Gwatkin subsequently stated that Runciman had asked him to write a report that would “support the Prime Minister’s policy”.Ashton-Gwatkin to Stopford, 22 January 1970, Stopford Papers, RJS, Imperial War Museum, London.

She also photographed people using techniques that made them appear as statuary: on columns or posing as if they were made of stone. Early life and career beginnings She was born in 1834 as Hannah Hatherly, in Bude, Cornwall. Hatherly married in 1852 Richard Maynard, an apprentice boot-maker, and in the same year they emigrated to Bowmanville in Canada West (present-day Ontario), where four of their five children were born.Wilks, Claire Weissman. The Magic Box: The Eccentric Genius of Hannah Maynard. Exile Editions, Toronto, 1980. In 1858, Richard joined the exodus of gold-seekers on the Fraser River in British Columbia, and his venture appears to have been profitable.Watson, Petra Rigby. The Photographs of Hannah Maynard: 19th Century Photographs. Exhibit Catalogue. Charles H. Scott Gallery, July 17 - August 23, 1992. While her husband was out west, Maynard learned the basics of photography, most likely from R & H O'Hara Photographers, in Bowmanville. After selling the boot store, in 1862 the family moved to Victoria on the Colony of Vancouver Island. Richard soon left for the Stikine River to take up placer mining, and it is believed that in 1862 Hannah opened up her first photographic studio, Mrs. R. Maynard's Photographic Gallery. Upon his return home in 1863, Richard found his wife successfully entrenched as a photographer, and by 1864 Hannah had taught her husband the principles of photography while he operated a second boot store.Palmquist, Peter E.; and Thomas R. Kailbourn. Pioneer Photographers of the Far West: A Biographical Dictionary 1840-1865. Stanford University Press. Stanford, California, 2000. Hannah and Richard Maynard In the ensuing years, Hannah and Richard had contrasting photographic specialties. Hannah was best known for her portrait work and at the same time managed darkroom affairs and studio promotion, while Richard focused almost exclusively on outdoor photography.Williams, Carol J. Framing the West: Race, Gender, and the Photographic Frontier in the Pacific Northwest. Oxford University Press, New York, 2003. The couple frequently traveled together, in 1875 to purchase photographic equipment in San Francisco, in 1879 on a pleasure cruise around Vancouver Island, and to Banff in the late 1880s. Hannah also made a solo trip to the Queen Charlotte Islands sometime in the same decade. Richard continued to travel on his own, to Alaska three times, and throughout British Columbia, sometimes sponsored by government commissions, and in 1892 he traveled to the Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea. While they published their photographs under separate imprints, it is sometimes unclear in the case of landscape views whether Hannah or Richard was the photographer. Portraiture and experimental photography Gems of British Columbia. 1883 Maynard's portrait work encompassed several different formats following the fashions of the day, cartes-de-visite in the 1860s, cabinet cards in the following decade, as well as larger-sized prints. The Maynard studio is known to have produced forty- three cartes-de-visite of native people, often Victoria street vendors. Maynard was a master of lighting technique, and she was one of the early adopters of line-lit photography to highlight facial features. Her backgrounds were often highly ornamental, utilizing painted backgrounds and elaborate domestic interiors and props. Starting about 1880, Maynard began to experiment with photomontage in her Gems of British Columbia series which she created each year between 1881 and 1895. Conceived as an annual greeting card to be sent out on New Years to all the mothers of children she had photographed in the preceding year, it was very popular. She cut out the outline of the photograph of each baby or child, and then mounted the images on a pane of window glass and re-photographed the whole. In 1884, she began to incorporate the montages of previous years in symbolist patterns, resulting in compositions that included up to several thousand individual photographs. Her Gems of 1885 was published and praised by the St. Louis and Canadian Photographer in 1886, bringing Maynard a measure of recognition throughout North America. Beginning in 1883 Maynard was struck by personal tragedy, with the death of her 16-year-old daughter Lillian of typhoid fever, followed in later years by another daughter Emma and daughter-in-law Adelaide, and some of her photographs began to take on the aspect of a memorial to the departed. It was also in this period that she took an interest in seances and Spiritualism. She began in the 1880s to create a type of photograph described by her as \\"Living Statuary\\" or \\"Statuary from Life\\", the sitter often appearing as a bust on a pedestal. Her experimentation developed further into the realm of multiple exposure, and some photographs show as many as four or five likenesses of Maynard, often engaged in different tasks, or in one notable image, holding a single garland of flowers. A selection of her double and multiple exposure photographs were published in the St. Louis and Canadian Photographer in 1894. Another difficult technique that Maynard pursued was that of bas-relief, which involved the embossing of a photograph. Around 1897, Maynard discontinued her investigations of trick photography. Later years and legacy Between 1897 and 1903, while continuing her studio portraiture, Maynard was the official photographer of the Victoria Police Department, producing mug shots as required. In 1907 her husband Richard died, and in 1912 she retired, selling her photographic equipment to a local Chinese photographer. She summarized her achievement by stating that \\"I think I can say with confidence that we photographed everyone in the town at one time or another.\\"Victoria Daily Colonist, September 29, 1912. Cited in Watson, 1992. Maynard died in 1918 in Victoria at the age of 84. She is buried in Ross Bay Cemetery. A play based on the life of Maynard, Be Still, premiered at Richmond's Gateway Theatre on March 1, 2001 and opened at Victoria's Belfry Theatre on March 14 of the same year.

The program was started in 2009 by Microsoft software engineer Kevin Wang, but after Wang's divisional president learned about the program, Microsoft incubated the program. TEALS' goal is to create self-perpetuating computer science programs within two or three years by having the software engineers teach the teachers. Volunteers undergo a three-month summer class that teach them about making lesson plans and leading classes. Afterwards, software engineers visit classrooms four or five mornings a week for the entire school year to teach computer science concepts to both students and teachers. TEALS volunteers are not required to be Microsoft employees and can have formal degrees or be self-taught in computer science. TEALS offers support for three classes: Introduction to Computer Science, Web Design, and AP Computer Science A. History Kevin Wang graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 2002 with a degree in electrical engineering and computer science. To pursue his teaching passion, he declined several industry job offers. Wang taught in the Bay Area for several years, and attended the Harvard Graduate School of Education, where he received a Master of Education. He became a computer science teacher at Woodside Priory School in Portola Valley, California, teaching grades seven–twelve for three years. He convinced fellow Microsoft employees and other acquaintances to teach computer science at other schools. After joining Microsoft, Wang started volunteering to teach the morning computer science class at Issaquah High School, a nearby high school, in 2009. In 2009, Wang founded Technology Education and Literacy in Schools (TEALS), a program that aims to bring software engineers to high school classrooms to teach computer science part-time. He thought that he would have to resign from Microsoft to oversee the program's significant expansion. Wang sold his Porsche 911 to bankroll the program. After the vice president of Wang's Microsoft division discovered TEALS, the vice president took him to the divisional president who recommended he work full-time at Microsoft on managing TEALS. According to CNN, Microsoft chose to \\"incubate\\" TEALS for three primary reasons. First, the program fit with Microsoft's philanthropic goals. Second, Microsoft founder Bill Gates had an enduring desire to advocate for learning. Third, the software industry had a shortage of engineers. In a 2012 interview with GeekWire, Wang said TEALS has two long- term goals. The first is to give every American high school student the opportunity to take an introductory computer science course and an AP Computer Science course. The second is to have the same proportion of students taking AP Computer Science as those taking AP Biology, AP Chemistry, and AP Physics. TEALS is part of YouthSpark, a Microsoft initiative that plans to give more educational and employment to 300 million young people between 2012 and 2015. A 2015 article in the Altavista Journal quoted the TEALS website, noting that the United States has 80,000 unfilled jobs that need a computer science degree. The Altavista Journal further reported that this would cause the United States to lose $500 billion over the following 10 years and that only 10% of American high schools have computer science courses. TEALS is managed by Microsoft's Akhtar Badshah, the senior director of citizenship and public affairs. Program format Wang designed a three-month summer class for Microsoft employees who wanted to volunteer with TEALS. The class taught the employees about devising lesson plans and leading classes. TEALS aims to create self-perpetuating computer science programs within two or three years. The software engineers commit to being physically present at the school for around four or five days weekly. The classes are scheduled for first period since many volunteers do not start work until later in the morning. For rural schools that lack the capital to run a computer science class, TEALS enables software engineers to instruct students distantly through videoconferencing. The first two semesters, the software engineers to educate the teachers side by side with the students. The third semester, the software engineers and teachers coteach the students. By the fourth semester, the teachers lead the class, and the software engineers become \\"teaching assistants\\". The aim is to enable the teachers who have math and science backgrounds in the future to lead the classes by themselves. TEALS provides support for three classes. Two of the classes are one-semester long: Introduction to Computer Science and Web Design. The third class, Advanced Placement Computer Science A, is two- semesters long. In a 2015 interview with the Altavista Journal, Microsoft spokesperson Kate Frischmann said, \\"TEALS is open to everyone, inside and outside of Microsoft, who have a background or formal degree in the field of computer science.\\" School participation In the 2010–2011 school year, the program's trial year, ten TEALS volunteers instructed 250 Puget Sound region high school students from four schools. In 2011–2012 school year, TEALS expanded to 30 volunteers and six assistants educating 800 high school students in 13 schools. In the 2012–2013 school year, 22 schools around Seattle participated in TEALS. Microsoft invited the students in Seattle to visit the company's campus, hoping to spark excitement in technology. That school year, TEALS expanded to 120 volunteers in seven states teaching 2,000 students at 37 high schools. The schools were in Washington, Kentucky, California, Virginia, Utah, Washington, D.C., Minnesota, and North Dakota. In the 2013–2014 school year, TEALS grew to 280 volunteers in 12 states educating 3,000 students at 70 schools.

The Erie Plain is a lacustrine plain that borders Lake Erie in North America. From Buffalo, New York, to Cleveland, Ohio, it is quite narrow (at best only a few miles/kilometers wide), but broadens considerably from Cleveland around Lake Erie to Southern Ontario, where it forms most of the Ontario peninsula. The Erie Plain was used in the United States as a natural gateway to the North American interior, and in both the United States and Canada the plain is heavily populated and provides very fertile agricultural land. Creation of the plain Early Lake Erie laid down some of the sediments that are the Erie Plain today. The Erie Plain is a lacustrine plain consisting largely of sediment laid down by a series of proglacial lakes. These existed in the late Pleistocene Epoch, about 25,000 years ago to about 11,700 years ago, and were created by glaciers of the Wisconsin glaciation (the last ice age). The largest of these was Lake Whittlesey. In some places in Pennsylvania and Ohio, the Erie Plain is broken by the very slight former shoreline of Lake Warren. This glacial sediment was laid atop the Chagrin and the Cleveland shales created in the late Devonian Period (382.5 to 359 million years ago), as well as early Carboniferous Period shale in and west of Cleveland (laid down 359 to 346 million years ago). West of Sandusky, Ohio, these sediments lie atop limestone laid down in the Silurian and Devonian periods. Due to its lacustrine origin, much of the soil of the Erie Plain contains abundant clay, although in some areas it is quiet sandy where ancient beaches formed. Beneath this relatively thin layer of soil is unconsolidated moraine, soil and rock left behind as the glaciers retreated. Description Three geologically distinct plains border Lake Erie. The lowest of these is the Ontario Plain, followed by the Huron Plain and then the Erie Plain. Escarpments separate the plains from one another. Between the Erie Plain and the Appalachian Plateau is the Portage Escarpment. The Erie Plain begins just east of Auburn, New York, where the Onondaga Escarpment meets the Portage Escarpment. The Onondaga Escarpment sharply distinguishes the Erie Plain from the Huron Plain east of Buffalo. But along the southern side of Lake Erie west of Buffalo, the Onondaga Escarpment is so slight that the Huron Plain and Erie Plain are essentially the same. At Buffalo, the plain narrows to just wide as the Portage Escarpment moves closer to the Lake Erie shoreline, and remains wide in Erie County, Pennsylvania. From Erie, Pennsylvania, to Cleveland, the plain broadens to about and is starkly defined by the Portage Escarpment, which rises in three terraces. The plain remains narrow until just west of Cleveland, where the Portage Escarpment moves to the south, and the definition between the plain and escarpment becomes much less distinct. The escarpment is broken in two places by the valleys of the Great Miami and Scioto rivers. The plain expands to between the Cuyahoga River and the Rocky River, and to west of the Rocky River around the southwest and western sides of Lake Erie. All told, the Erie Plain covers about one-fourth of the state of Ohio. The Erie Plain extends into Michigan where the Marshall Escarpment forms the inland boundary between the Erie Plain and the interior uplands. The Erie Plain also covers most of the Southern Ontario peninsula between Lake Erie and Lake Huron. Here, the Niagara Escarpment separates the Erie Plain from the Huron Plain to the north. In Ohio, the combined Huron-Erie Plain begins at a mean altitude of above sea level, and gradually rises in a series of slight, rolling hills to more than above sea level. In Ontario, post-glacial rebound has lifted the Huron Plain in the north higher than the Erie Plain in the south. South of Georgian Bay, the Niagara Escarpment lifts the Huron Plain to more than above sea level. The Erie Plain lacks distinguishing features, except for occasional recessional moraines, and the remnants of proglacial lake beaches and lakeside cliffs. In Pennsylvania, the plain is marked only by a series of slight terraces; the boundary between each marks ancient lake shorelines. Cushing, Leverett, and Van Horn identify at least three moraines between Erie, Pennsylvania, and Ohio's Rocky River: The Cleveland, the Euclid, and the Defiance. West of the Rocky River are three ridges (the North, Middle, and Butternut) roughly paralleling the modern lakeshore, ancient beaches formed by proglacial expansions of Early Lake Erie. In Indiana, the lack of distinguishing features allows the plain to merge with the Mississippi River basin lowlands. On the Niagara Peninsula, morainic ridges interrupt the Erie Plain close to the Niagara Escarpment, as well as a few east–west flowing river valleys. Settlement and economic development The Erie Plain connects with the Mohawk Valley in the east, and provides the only natural, low-lying route north of the Gulf Coast to the North American interior from the Atlantic seaboard. Consequently, this area is heavily populated. The city of Cleveland is largely built on sediments which form the Erie Plain. The Welland Canal cuts north–south across the Erie Plain on the Niagara Peninsula. The Deep Cut on the canal, between Allanburg, and Port Robinson, has created two distinct economic districts in the area. The northern district connects with shipping on Lake Ontario, while the southern district is much more aligned with shipping on Lake Erie. Settlement of Ohio largely occurred along the Erie Plain, following the natural barrier of the Portage Escarpment. In the far northwest of the state, settlement was inhibited by the poorly drained portion of the Erie Plain known as the Great Black Swamp. This area was heavily forested, but nearly all of this primeval forest (representing half of Ohio's woodlands) was clear-cut by 1900. Although the Erie Plain was Ohio's richest farmland, it was also its least forested by the start of the 20th century. Viticulture on the Erie Plain in Ohio has been extensive, both due to the fertile soil and the temperate climate. Watershed Rivers of Ohio, with glacial moraines, showing how the moraines affect the watershed of the Erie Plain. Lake Erie essentially occupies a depression in the middle of the Erie Plain, with the plain tilted toward the lake. The watershed in Ohio is about . The Erie Plain drains into Lake Erie, except for that portion east of Buffalo (which drains into Lake Ontario). Water on the Appalachian Plateau, on the other hand, drains to the Gulf of Mexico. In Ohio, brooks generally cut into the plain , while rivers dig channels deep. The plain is so narrow in Ohio that it has no watershed distinct from that which forms in the Portage Escarpment. The Erie Plain in extreme northwest Ohio is not as well-drained as that in the rest of the state, as glacial moraines partially block water in the area. This area was previously known as the Great Black Swamp, until drained by white settlers in the 1800s. Much of the Erie Plain lies beneath Lake Erie, which has a relatively shallow average depth of just . Climate From the beginning of recordkeeping in the early 1800s to 1921, the average rainfall on the plain was about a year, with the rainiest months being June and July and the driest October. Prior to human settlement, the combination of landform and rainfall left the Erie Plain with typical prairie plants. Marshes and shallow lakes formerly dotted the landscape here, but human-caused drainage since 1800 has largely erased these and left highly fertile plains behind. Southeastern Michigan, however, still contains many of these distinctive hardwood forest swamps and marshy prairies. The relatively flat nature of the plain presents little inhibition to wind and the flow of weather across the plain. However, the large cities which line Lake Erie tend to create urban heat islands which can cause local instabilities. Lake Erie itself, however, tends to lessen the effects of cold arctic air masses coming from the north, making the Erie Plain more temperate.

As was fashionable among upper class females of her time, she was active as a social reformer through philanthropy. In 1838, she married Rudolf Wilkens (1809-1897) and settled in Karlshamn. They raised a family but lost their youngest child, Thomina who died of scarlet fever at the age of four. Career Between the years 1850-1877, she started and established three facilities in Karlskrona: Children's Home (Barnhemmet), Deaf Institute (Dövstuminstitutet) and Protection Center (Skyddshemmet) which received people from throughout Southern Sweden. In 1859, she was given the care of an intellectually disabled girl. The same year, she founded her own orphanage. In 1864, the commune decided to do something for the deaf and mute of the county and her school, being the only one in existence, were given financial support. The following year, it was moved into new localities, and from 1868 onward, it was given governmental support. At this point in time, there had been combined schools and homes for deaf and mute children in Sweden since the pioneer work of Pär Aron Borg in Stockholm. While there were no schools for intellectually disabled children, and the care for them were in fact not developed at all, they were often included at the schools for deaf and mute children. Thereby, it was natural for her to receive children with both physical as well as intellectual handicaps at the same school. However, through experience of the education of children with different forms of handicaps together, she developed the conviction, that it was healthy for the intellectually disabled to be tutored with children with a normal development. Sophia Wilkens became a strong spokesperson for the line of inclusion: she believed that the intellectually disabled should not be institutionalized, but rather be educated with the goal to be included in public society as self-supporting and valuable professionals. Her combined orphanage and school were therefore not an institution were people were placed for life, as the other institutions founded during the second half of the 19th century, but a home were the pupils were educated and trained to be released to function in society. After confirmation, she arranged employment for the students. The males were often successfully employed within handicrafts or with the Royal Navy. However, it was more difficult to find employment for females, especially since Wilkens would like to protect them from the fear of abuse. Therefore, she founded an adjoining working home, Skyddshem för abnorma flickor (1869-1911), where the majority of her female former students were employed manufacturing textiles which did become very successful and managed to support itself. This was controversial in a period when intellectually disabled people were regarded to be of no use for society, and authorities therefore generally considered it to be the task of private charity to care for them rather than the state. From 1870s, she participated in the Nordic pedagogue meetings for the schooling of the disabled. A pioneer, she stated that as she had no support from science, she had to rely on her own experience, and that compassion had taught her that the disabled could and should be tutored to manage on their own rather than to be institutionalized. Sophia Wilkens ran the establishments until 1877, when she turned 60. In 1890, the deaf institute was integrated into the county system. Public support was established for the other institutions; for the school in 1907 and the work shelter in 1911. The children's home was discontinued in 1957. In retirement, she lived on a farm in the parish of Augerum in Blekinge County. Awards She was awarded the Swedish royal medal Illis quorum meruere labores (commonly called Illis Quorum) in 1873. Legacy Alongside Emanuella Carlbeck, Sophia Wilkens was one of the two pioneers in the education of the intellectually disabled in Sweden in the mid-19th century, when the education and care of this category was developed in Europe, in contrast to other nations, were the pioneers were normally male. However, it was to be Carlbeck whose ideas was to set the pattern from the treatment in Sweden in the following decades. Carlbeck and Wilkens represented two contrasting lines in the education of the intellectually disabled: while Carlbeck focused on giving them humane treatment, but for a life in an institution, Wilkens contested institutionalization and spoke for inclusion of this category of patients within society, and education of them to be self- supporting members of society. The line of Wilkens was too progressive for the 19th century, when education and care at all was considered controversial, and her ideas were not to be given much support until the second half of the 20th century.

The dpon-chen or pönchen, literally the \\"great authority\\" or \\"great administrator\\", was the chief administrator or governor of Tibet located at Sakya Monastery during the Yuan administrative rule of Tibet in the 13th and 14th centuries. In the Mongol Empire the office of the dpon-chen was established in the 1260s and functioned for all practical purposes as the Tibetan government at the pleasure of the Mongol emperors of the Yuan dynasty, unlike the Sakya Imperial Preceptors (Dishi) who were active at the Yuan court. The Mongols set up a government agency and top-level administrative department known as the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs in Khanbaliq (modernBeijing) that supervised Buddhist monks in addition to managing the territory of Tibet; one of the department's purposes was to select a dpon-chen to govern Tibet when the Sakya Lama (e.g. Drogön Chögyal Phagpa) was away. The Dpon-Chen was invariably a Tibetan nominated by the ruling Sakya Lama and approved by the reigning emperor. His function was, apart from being the chief executive head of the Sakya Government, to appoint a tripön for each of the 13 myriarchies, and to act as liaison between the Yuan government and Tibet.China's Tibet Policy, by Dawa Norbu, p55-56 Nevertheless, this system also led to conflicts between the Sakya leaders and the dpon-chens. While dpon-chens had a small army in Sakya itself, their major military support came from the Mongols or Yuan dynasty when an internal rebellion or external invasion occurred. As Yuan declined in the mid-14th century however, in Tibet, Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen toppled the Sakya and founded the Phagmodrupa Dynasty, marking the end of the dpon- chen system.

Horwitz (1 January 1892 – 11 October 1992), known as Jack, was an American businessman and philanthropist and a fashion innovator whose company, Horwitz and Duberman (founded 1925), was one of the first to specialise in junior miss and teenage clothing. Early life Horwitz was born 1 January 1892,\\"United States Social Security Death Index,\\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:JKY2-QZX : accessed 5 July 2015), Jacob H Horwitz, 11 Oct 1992; citing U.S. Social Security Administration, Death Master File, database (Alexandria, Virginia: National Technical Information Service, ongoing). in London. His family migrated to America while he was a child, with the assistance of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. He went to school in Connecticut, graduating in 1910. Rather than study engineering at Yale University, the young Horwitz and a friend decided to launch a grocer's in Manhattan. As a member of the National Guard of the United States Horwitz was called into service under John J. Pershing to participate in the Pancho Villa Expedition. When he returned, he found the grocery business had been bankrupted. Horwitz then served in World War I in France as a sergeant, and as a cavalryman in Argonne. Fashion Horwitz formed the Horwitz & Duberman company in 1925. His partner, Duberman, was a Ukrainian Russian Jew who had emigrated from Hamburg in April 1913 after deserting from the Russian Army, and became a naturalised citizen in 1920. Horwitz & Duberman originally produced shirtwaists, which Horwitz added skirts to in order to create dresses. In 1987 Horwitz recalled that when young women and teenagers had to buy clothing, they were forced to buy adult size clothing and then alter it to make it fit. At that time, the \\"junior miss\\" market was largely overlooked, and by offering clothing under the \\"Judy and Jill Fashions\\" label specifically for teenagers and young women, Horwitz's business proved successful. In 1939 the company offered dresses branded with the name of the popular actress and singer Deanna Durbin, who was in her late teens at the time, and a Junior Miss size. Horwitz was awarded the Coty Award in 1947 alongside Nettie Rosenstein, Adele Simpson, and Mark Mooring, the made-to- order designer for Bergdorf Goodman. That year, the awards were selected to reflect the best examples of each of the industry's four main branches, with Horwitz chosen to represent junior fashion. Horwitz said in 1987 that he received the award as much for his encouragement and support of his young employees as for his own work, particularly as he was conscious to hire young women whom he would teach design and sales skills. Although Horwitz designed clothing, he saw himself as \\"more of a stylist than a designer,\\" and worked closely with his young employees, choosing what to make up from their design drawings. In March 1953 LIFE ran an article showing a weekend capsule wardrobe designed by Betse Cann for Horwitz & Duberman, offering six crushproof outfits which could be fitted, along with underwear and accessories, into a single handbag. In the early 1950s Horwitz bought out Duberman, and the company became Jack Horwitz Associates. He had retired from his business by 1960, but went on to assist a friend who worked in the coat-making business before retiring finally in 1970. Philanthropy As a philanthropist Horwitz was particularly remembered for his role in founding the Long Island Jewish Medical Center in 1949, on whose board of directors he sat for over forty years. At the age of 94 he was still actively attending the center's board and committee meetings. He was also involved in the founding of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute, and fundraising for the Institute. He also supported and served as an officer for the Fashion Institute of Technology and the American Legion alongside Jewish organisations such as the HIAS (who had assisted him and his family to come to the United States), the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, the Five Towns Young Men's and Young Women's Hebrew Association, and the Temple Israel synagogue in Lawrence, Long Island. Later life and death Horwitz was married to Rose Greenberger for 59 years until her death in 1986.

He produced over 100 publications, many focused on the biology of reptiles and birds, but also on insects, ecological succession, and the history of Utah. He and his wife of 55 years, Grace Atkin Woodbury, died in an automobile collision on August 1, 1964 near Loveland, Colorado. Early life Angus Woodbury was born July 11, 1886 in St. George, Utah, to parents John Taylor and Mary Evans Woodbury. His elementary education was divided between Salt Lake City, where his father taught at LDS College, and St. George. He attended Brigham Young High School in Provo, graduating after two years in 1906. Career Woodbury was hired by the U.S. Forest Service in 1908 and worked there until 1920. His duties included working to establish boundaries of Dixie National Forest and managing grazing and logging. From 1920 to 1926 he took courses at Dixie College, where he also served as a teaching assistant. In 1925 he became the first ranger-naturalist hired at Zion National Park, where he worked each summer until 1933, establishing the periodical Zion-Bryce Nature Notes. From 1926 to 1927 Woodbury attended Brigham Young University, earning a B.S. in zoology. From 1927 to 1928 he attended the University of Utah, completing an M.S. degree focused on the reptiles of Utah. After graduating he joined the University of Utah faculty, teaching for the 1928–29 academic year before taking leave to obtain a Ph.D. at the University of California, Berkeley, which he completed in 1931.

The Woodbury Desert Study Area, southwestern Utah Woodbury's research specialized in reptiles and birds of Utah, especially wintering behavior of snakes and tortoises and the geographic distribution of birds. In 1949, he published along with Ross Hardy a \\"classic study\\" on the biology of wild desert tortoises: professor Peter Alagona of UC Santa Barbara writes, \\"Their paper provided key insights into the species’ physiology, life history and ecology, and it served as a basis for subsequent research into tortoise evolutionary biology, biogeography, and epidemiology.\\" In 1977, the area where Woodbury and Hardy studied was designated the Woodbury Desert Study Area by the Bureau of Land Management, and is now a part of the Beaver Dam Wash National Conservation Area. Woodbury was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Ornithological Union, the Herpetological League, and the Utah Academy of Science, Arts and Letters. He supervised the graduate research of nine students who studied birds. Species named for him include the water bug Ambrysus woodburyi and a subspecies of chisel-toothed kangaroo rat, Dipodomys microps woodburyi. Personal life and family  Woodbury married Grace Atkin on January 15, 1909. The couple had four sons and two daughters: sons Lowell Angus, Dixon Miles, and John Walter all obtained Ph.D.s in biology, while son Max Atkin obtained a Ph.D. in mathematics.

Life Adrien Karbowsky was born on 15 December 1855. He was a pupil of Jean-Baptiste Lavastre, who decorated the Paris Opera, and of Justin Lequien. Karbowski also studied under Pierre Puvis de Chavannes. His Le bras Mignot, à Poissy was exhibited at the Salon of the Société des Artistes Français in 1881 in the Palais des Champs-Élysées, Paris. On 1 May 1886 his Calendrier républicain was shown at the Salon. At the Salon of 1889 he received an honorable mention. Karbowsky became a leading decorator in the Art Nouveau style. He collaborated with Frantz Jourdain and Puvis de Chavannes. Karbowsky was made a knight of the Legion of Honour in 1902. He became a member of the Société de l'Art à L'École, founded in 1906 with the aim of improving public taste by teaching public school students about art and decorating the schools. A reviewer for American Art News wrote in February 1918, In 1923 Karbowsky was among the 27 dissenting members of the board of the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts who formed a new and more eclectic Salon with the encouragement of the Minister of Fine Arts. The plan was to exhibit paintings and sculptures ranging in style from the most conservative to the most advanced. The Salon would be held in springtime, at the peak season for visitors to Paris. Adrien Karbowsky died on 14 March 1945, aged 89. Selected works Karbowsky contributed decorative tapestry designs for the Manufacture Nationale des Gobelins. He also designed tapestries for the Manufacture Nationale de Tapisseries de Beauvais. He designed the decorative silk tapestries in pink for the Salon du Bois in the Museum of Decorative Arts, opened in 1900 in the Pavilion de Marsan of the Louvre Palace. Murals include: *1893: Decorative murals in the Château de Verteuil, Charente, whose library Jourdain remodelled in 1893. *1903–07: With Louis Jaulmes, murals for the Villa Kerylos in Cap-Ferrat, as directed by the Hellenic scholar Théodore Reinach, in mythological scenes often copied from Attic pottery. *1909: Also with Jaulmes, decoration of the dining room of the exclusive Hôtel Royal in Évian-les-Bains. *Frescoes for the dining room of the Hôtel Lutétia in Paris and the Hôtel de Ville in Nogent-sur-Marne. *1920s Decoration of the Domaine de Montaigu in Nancy in collaboration with the local architect Pierre le Bourgeon.

The group is best known for their single release, containing the songs \\"Tryin' to Mess My Mind\\" and \\"She's the One,\\" which have become cult classics in the garage rock musical genre, and are included on several compilations. History Dr. Spec's Optical Illusion was from the Gentilly Woods subdivision of Gentilly, a section in eastern New Orleans, near Lake Ponchatrain adjacent to the Industrial Canal. The group originally formed in 1965 as the Illusions, supposedly when brothers Kris Sherman (vocals, rhythm guitar) and Scott Sherman (drums) had a jam session with Marshall Clyburn (lead guitar) on Halloween night. They would shortly thereafter recruit Brice \\"Pinky\\" Hatchett (bass guitar) and Rick Stelma (keyboards). The band became a popular live act, performing in the local circuit and winning as contestants in battle of the bands. Sometimes after contests, the group had to contend with retrograde hoodlums who bullied them about the length of their hair and mod clothes, in a local rivalry between \\"greasers\\" (sometimes referred by Crescent City locals then as \\"pits\\") and the more stylish \\"frats.\\" In early performances, the Illusions' set list was typically dominated by cover versions of other artists' material ranging from British Invasion songs to R&B; standards by artists such as James Brown and Curley Moore. In addition, the band was notorious for their ear-shattering performances, with the local speech and hearing director measuring their cacophony at 140 decibels. In 1967, while the Illusions were playing a show at the Mardi Gras Bowling Alley, James Migliaccio, the manager of the establishment and the owner of the small Flambeau Records label, proposed funding for a single. The group's two original compositions, \\"Tryin' to Mess My Mind,\\" distinctive for Scott Sherman's wailing vocals and its organ-driven protopunk instrumental backing, as well as \\"She's the One,\\" were recorded at Cosimo Matassa's Jazz City Studio on Camp Street, and are both considered garage rock classics. Two additional songs, \\"The Undertaker\\" and \\"Too Busy Laughing\\" were also penned for a possible follow-up single. In September 1967, the single was released under the name Dr. Spec's Optical Illusion, as suggested by R&B; singer Joyce Harris to sound more psychedelic, and charted quickly around the region. However, the band members' parents refused to agree to a recording contract with Migiliacco and the single's distribution was abruptly halted. The group disbanded by 1968. Though the single was limited to its regional release, it has gained interest over the years. Both songs are included on the compilation album, Louisiana Punk, and \\"She's the One\\" appears on Teenage Shutdown! The World Ain't Round, It's Square! in 1998. In September 2004, the band reconvened for the Tryin’ To Mess My Mind Festival put on in their honor, alongside The Seeds and Question Mark and the Mysterians, and other Louisiana garage bands from the 60s, such as the Bad Roads and others. Their single saw its first reissue by Crypt Records. Drummer Scott Sherman died during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 at the age of 54.

Schoelkopf III (born January 24, 1964) is an American physicist, most noted for his work on quantum computing as one of the inventors of superconducting qubits. Schoelkopf's main research areas are quantum transport, single-electron devices, and charge dynamics in nanostructures. His research utilizes quantum-effect and single-electron devices, both for fundamental physical studies and for applications. Techniques often include high-speed, high-sensitivity measurements performed on nanostructures at low temperatures. Schoelkopf serves as director of the Yale Center for Microelectronic Materials and Structures and as associate director of the Yale Institute for Nanoscience and Quantum Engineering. Since 2014, Schoelkopf is also the Director of the Yale Quantum Institute. Biography Schoelkopf was born in Manhattan, New York City, the son of art dealer and Hudson River School expert Robert J. Schoelkopf II. Schoelkopf received his A.B. in physics from Princeton University, cum laude, in 1986, and his Ph.D. from Caltech in 1995.Schoelkopf Lab, \\"Robert J. Schoelkopf Curriculum Vitae From 1986 to 1988 he was an electrical/cryogenic engineer in the Laboratory for High-Energy Astrophysics at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, where he developed low- temperature radiation detectors and cryogenic instrumentation for future space missions. He came to Yale as a postdoctoral researcher in the group of Daniel Prober in 1995. Moving to Yale University, he was from 1995 to 1998 a lecturer and associate research scientist, advancing to assistant professor in 1998, and professor of applied physics and physics in 2003. He was later awarded the titles Sterling Professor of Applied Physics and Physics and William A. Norton Professor of Applied Physics and Physics. Schoelkopf was a visiting professor at the University of New South Wales in Australia in 2008. He has been an invited lecturer at universities and professional organizations throughout the United States and in Canada and Europe. Schoelkopf was a semi-finalist for Discover magazine's Technological Innovation of the Year in 1999. His other honors include NASA's Technical Innovator Award. He is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Physical Society. He became the William A. Norton Professor at Yale in 2013 and the Sterling Professor of Applied Physics and Physics. Schoelkopf was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2015. His other honors include Fellow in the American Physical Society and Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.  Research  Robert Schoelkopf focuses his research on the development of superconducting devices for quantum information processing, which might eventually lead to revolutionary advances in computing. In 2007, a team of scientists led by Schoelkopf and Steven Girvin made a major breakthrough in quantum computing when it engineered a superconducting communication \\"bus\\" to store and transfer information between distant quantum bits, or qubits, on a chip. Their work is the first step to making the fundamentals of quantum computing useful. In 2009, their team demonstrated the first electronic quantum processor which could perform a quantum computation. Schoelkopf's techniques emphasize high-speed, high-sensitivity measurements performed on nanostructures at low temperatures. Together with his former supervisor Daniel Prober and his laboratory team, Schoelkopf invented the Radio-Frequency Single-Electron Transistor, an electrometer capable of measuring sub-electron charges on nano-second timescales. This new transistor allowed them to study electrical transport at the single-charge level in various systems. They also developed new types of sensors and detectors that employ these capabilities. Schoelkopf's current research focus, together with Michel Devoret and Steven Girvin of the Yale Department of Applied Physics, is to further develop superconducting circuits that might one day lead to a practical quantum computer. Other projects are directed at developing \\"hybrid\\" quantum systems based on integrating cold atoms, molecules, or electrons with solid-state circuits. Schoelkopf's law In quantum computing, roughly every three years, quantum decoherence can be delayed by a factor of 10. It is the quantum computing analogue of Moore's law.

Sphaerosyllis georgeharrisoni is distinct by its large parapodial glands with hyaline material; by its small size; short proventricle; a median antenna that is inserted posteriorly to the lateral antennae; as well as long pygidial papillae. Juveniles of S. hirsuta are very similar to this species. Sphaerosyllis pygipapillata has all of its antennae aligned, a smooth dorsum, while its pygidial papillae are longer and slender. The species' name honours George Harrison, musician who died prior to the species' describing article's publication. Description The species' body is small, with a total length of and width of , including 26 chaetigers. It possesses small papillae that cover its dorsum, extending to its palps and parapodia, being quite numerous on its midbody. Its prostomium is rectangular and is mostly covered by the peristomium, showing 4 eyes in a trapezoidal arrangement. Its antennae are similar in length to the prostomium; they have bulbous bases and moderate tips. Its tentacular cirri are similar but shorter than the antennae; the dorsal cirri are short, similar in length to its tentacular cirri. Its parapodial glands are large, with hyaline material present. Its anterior parapodia have about 5 compound chaetae each, with unidentate blades provided with long spines which are longer on dorsal chaetae, exhibiting dorsoventral gradation in length. Posterior parapodia, on the other hand, possess 3 compound chaetae with larger shafts and shorter blades which are slightly hooked. The dorsal simple chaetae from chaetiger 1 are unidentate and show long marginal spines. Its ventral simple chaetae on the posterior parapodia are sigmoid, smooth and unidentate. Its acicula is solitary, with tips bent to a right angle. The pharynx spans approximately 3 segments and is relatively slender, its pharyngeal tooth located anteriorly. Its proventricle spans through 1 segments, with 13-14 muscle cell rows. Its pygidium is small, with a few long papillae and 2 anal cirri, which are similar in shape to the dorsal cirri but longer. Distribution S. georgeharrisoni was found in areas near or at the Houtman Abrolhos up until Carnarvon, Western Australia, at a depth of between in dead corals and sand on coral reefs in shallow waters. Its distribution is thought to include the whole of WA.

It was first isolated from the Turia River in Valencia, hence its name. It is considered endangered. This species is differentiated from its cogeneratesa by having eight branched rays in its dorsal fin; eight branched rays in its anal fin; two rows of pharyngeal teeth on both sides possessing 2 and 5 teeth (); a wide caudal peduncle; its number of gill rakers; the number of scales in its lateral line; the number of scale rows above the latter; by possessing three scale rows below it; by having thirty-nine vertebrae (twenty-two of them abdominal and seventeen of them caudal); showing large 4th and 5th infraorbital bones; a maxilla with a very distinctlt marked anterior process; exhibiting a frontal bone expanded at the middle; a wide neurocranium bone; the lower branch of the pharyngeal bone being robust; a large and narrow urohyal; as well as genetic differences (allozymes). Description Squalius valentinus is a small sized species that is usually shorter than ; its head is large and similar to the maximum body depth. Its preorbital distance is similar to its eye's diameter, exhibiting a long interorbital distance. Its ventral fin is inserted at the origin of the dorsal fin, on its same axis. Its predorsal length is somewhat larger than its preventral length. It possesses a high caudal peduncle. It shows a large fin size, with a pectoral fin that is larger than the height of its dorsal fin. Pigmentation Its body is silver, somewhat darker dorsally; its scales have a big black spot at their base and several small black spots on its distal border. Its peritoneum also carries small black spots. Its scales are deciduous in juveniles. Osteology It possesses a wide and short supraethmoid, parietal and frontal bones. The posterior process of its pterotic bone is wide and robust, while the pharyngeal bone's lower branch is very robust. Its urohyal bone is large and thin. The maxilla's anterior process is pointed, and its 4th and 5th infraorbital bones are very wide. The posterior lamina of its cleithrum is widened. It shows a short maxilla with a relatively developed coronoid process. Itd 3rd, 4th and 5th pharyngeal teeth in its external row are small or even lack a masticatory area. Distribution and habitat Squalius valentinus inhabits rivers in the Spanish Mediterranean, between the Mijares and Vinalopó basins. The Júcar basin is inhabited by both this species and S. pyrnaicus, although both species are allopatry, the latter inhabiting the upper basin while former is distributed throughout rivers of the lower basin. The species usually is found to inhabit streams with clear waters and gravel bottoms. In streams such as the Gorgos River it is the only endemic fish. In the Turia and Mijares basins it occurs in sympatry with other native cyprinids: Barbus guiraonis, Chondrostoma turiense and Chondrostoma arcasii. S. valentinus inhabits the Júcar, Serpis and Vinalopó basins along with B. guiraonis. Status The IUCN lists this fish as being a vulnerable species because of its limited range which covers less than , and due to water abstraction for the construction of dams as well as the introduction of foreign species. It is a rare species and has a restricted distribution range. The population is currently declining. S. valentinus is frequently dominant as a species in small rivers, however in wide rivers the species is local and rare. References Further reading *Doadrio Villarejo, Ignacio, Silvia Perea, and F.

He is best known for his contributions to the invention and development of Expanded Books, an early form of E-books, at the Voyager Company, and for his writings and public speaking about digital media innovation and marketing, including TEDx talks in Austria, as well as his 1999 essay \\"The Medium is the Memory,\\" originally published in MIT Press's The Digital Dialectic: New Essays on New Media, edited by Peter Lunenfeld. Brody serves as principal at The Halo Agency, which supports European start-up businesses looking to enter the US market.  Career   Digital media innovation  In the late 80s and early 90s, Brody was head of the Expanded Books Project at the Voyager Company and was involved in the development and creation of their \\"expanded books\\", originally designed to be read on the then-new Apple PowerBook 100. The Voyager Company released their first expanded books on floppy disk for the PowerBook in 1992, and presented them at that year's MacWorld Expo. The books on this original disk were Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams, and Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll. Brody's public statements at the time on the Voyager Company's early expanded books, or 'e-books', were that he believed they were more of an experiment than a definitive 'product', paving the way for future versions of e-books for the next generation of less expensive, more lightweight, and more high-powered portable computers.  Digital evangelism  Brody has spoken about digital media innovation and marketing in both Europe and the US. He has done multiple TEDx talks in Austria.  Business and consultant work  Brody has been principal partner at The Halo Agency, which provides business consultation to European start-up tech-based businesses looking to enter the US market, founding president of ASciNA, Austrian Scientists and Scholars in North America, Vice President of Marketing at Visuvi, Inc., and Vice President of Marketing at Envizio, a company that he co-founded to facilitate technology business transactions. He has also served as Director of Marketing at Amazon.com's search and advertising development subsidiary A9.com, was head of Marketing Communications at YouSendIt (now called Hightail), and served as Director of Business Development at Red Herring Magazine.  Academia  In 1999, Brody published his essay \\"The Medium is the Memory\\" in MIT Press's The Digital Dialectic: New Essays on New Media, edited by Peter Lunenfeld, where he analyzed the history of how society has evolved different mediums of 'remembering', from oral history to modern-day digital records. He studied Computer Linguistics in Vienna, where he grew up, and began his career working at the Cinémathèque Française in Paris, a library with one of the largest archives of films, movie documents and film-related objects in the world.

Early life Born and raised in a family of musicians in Lahaina, Hawaii, Willie began performing at the age of 8 alongside his father, Hawaiian jazz guitarist Manu Kahaiali’i. Career In 1993, Willie began a collaboration with Amy Hānaialiʻi Gilliom that would last for nine years. The pair recorded, performed, and toured together, and also shared a personal relationship. Their recordings won seven Na Hoku Hanohano Awards, part of Willie's total of 19 Hokus as a musician and producer. In 2005, Willie's reunion album with Gilliom, Amy & Willie Live, was nominated for a Grammy in the first year of the Best Hawaiian Music Album award. In 2007, Willie K became one of very few artists to win a Hoku as part of three different acts – his collaboration with Eric Gilliom won Best Contemporary Hawaiian Album, in addition to wins already achieved with Amy and as a solo artist. Cancer and death In February 2018, Willie K was diagnosed with lung cancer and promptly cancelled upcoming performances in Honolulu. In April 2019, Willie announced via his Facebook page that he was undergoing immunotherapy. In January 2020, in a video posted to Facebook, Willie announced that his cancer was at the terminal stage. He made the video after a concert at Blue Note Hawaii in Waikiki. He stated that his \\"spirits remained high during the concert,\\" which was supposed to be only a 90-minute set, but lasted for two hours. \\"The crowd deserved it,\\" he said.

On the show, he is portrayed by Australian actor Robert Taylor. Walt Longmire Mysteries History A native of Durant, Wyoming (the county seat of fictional Absaroka County), Walt attended the University of Southern California, where he played offensive lineman for the USC Trojans and graduated with a degree in English literature. He then served in the Marine Corps and completed boot camp at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island and Officer Candidates School at Marine Corps Base Quantico. He was assigned to the 1st Marine Division as a military police officer, and served in country at Tan Son Nhut Air Base during the Vietnam War. He served in the Marines for four years, and earned, among other decorations, the Navy Cross, Silver Star, Bronze Star, and Purple Heart. After serving in Vietnam, Walt spent six weeks assigned as security at Johnston Atoll. Upon his discharge from the Marines, Walt spent some time working at an oil rig in Anchorage, Alaska, before returning home to Wyoming, where he was hired by Sheriff Lucian Connally as a deputy sheriff in 1972. Walt was elected as the Absaroka County Sheriff after Lucian all but threw the race and decided to retire. In the series In the first book, The Cold Dish, Walt is mentioned as having been the sheriff of Absaroka County and plans to run for re-election again the following year. He investigates the murders of two white teenagers who had been found guilty, but not severely punished, for raping a local Indian girl, Melissa Little Bird. In Death Without Company, Walt investigates the death of a Basque woman who was, for a few hours in the 1940s, married to Lucian before her family had the marriage annulled. During his tenure as sheriff \\"of the least populated county in the least populated state in the union\\", five murders have occurred in Absaroka County with three of them taking place since 2004 (in The Cold Dish and Death Without Company). In Kindness Goes Unpunished, Walt visits Cady in Philadelphia, where he joins forces with the Philadelphia Police Department to investigate an assault on Cady that has left her in a coma. In Another Man's Moccasins, Walt investigates the murder of a young Vietnamese woman, which reminds him of his first murder investigation – the death of a prostitute outside of Tan Son Nhut Air Base by an American officer in 1968. In The Dark Horse, Walt goes undercover as an insurance investigator from Billings, Montana, in Campbell County, Wyoming (at the unofficial request of the Campbell County Sheriff), to determine if a woman truly murdered her husband, a man with a dubious past and a gift for making enemies, after he allegedly burned down their barn and killed their horses for the insurance money. In Hell is Empty, Walt became lost on the Big Horn Mountains with a federal prisoner/serial killer. (This book was later adapted into the Longmire season-two episode \\"Unquiet Mind\\".) In As the Crow Flies, Walt assists the newly appointed chief of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation Tribal Police, Iraq War-veteran Lolo Long, with the investigation into the death of a young woman who fell from a cliff with her child in her arms, while simultaneously preparing for Cady's wedding. In A Serpent's Tooth, Walt deals with a multistate polygamous cult when he tries to help a Mormon \\"lost boy\\" that leads to Big Oil, the Central Intelligence Agency, and a Mexican drug cartel, which ultimately costs the life of one of his deputies and the grievous injury of another. In Spirit of Steamboat, Walt flashes back to Christmas Eve 1988 (his second month as sheriff) when Lucian, a World War II veteran of the 38th Bombardment Group, and he transport an injured girl (the sole survivor of a car accident) from Durant to Denver during a snowstorm in a decommissioned North American B-25 Mitchell. In Any Other Name, Walt investigates the suicide of a Campbell County Sheriff's Investigator at the request of Lucian and Sheriff Sandy Sandburg, which nearly causes him to miss the birth of his grandchild in Philadelphia. In Dry Bones, Walt deals with the discovery of a Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton on Native American land within his county and the subsequent death of the property's owner, resulting in a joint investigation with the FBI under the scrutiny of the newly announced deputy United States attorney for the district of Wyoming. In the middle of the investigation, Walt learns that his son-in-law, Officer Michael Moretti, was killed in the line of duty in Philadelphia; although he desperately wants to fly east and assist in the investigation, he remains stuck in Durant to complete his own case (however, he does allow Vic, Michael's sister, to take a leave of absence). During his career, he becomes well-respected by not only his county, but also by the Wyoming State Attorney General's Office (including the Attorney General, Joe Meyer, himself), the DCI, and even the governor of Wyoming. Later mentioned, somewhat jokingly, if a police officer is murdered in Wyoming, Walt Longmire is on the case. As sheriff, Walt carries a M1911A1 in .45 ACP (the same one he used in the Marine Corps) as his primary weapon, and drives a pickup truck that he calls the Silver Bullet (or just Bullet). Relationships Walt is a widower; Martha, his wife, was murdered in Denver, Colorado, while suffering from cancer (in the TV series; in the books she dies of cancer). With Martha, he had a daughter, Cady, who is now an attorney in Philadelphia. In As the Crow Flies, Walt mentions that he dated Martha before he was drafted, and that their relationship resumed after he came home from the war. The two eloped and were married by a justice of the peace in Miles City, Montana, when her father refused to pay for a big church wedding. In the same book, Cady marries Philadelphia Police Officer Michael Moretti, the brother of Walt's undersheriff, Vic Moretti, on the Rez; Michael and she had been seeing each other since Kindness Goes Unpunished and engaged since The Dark Horse. In Any Other Name, Cady guves birth to a daughter, Lola Longmire Moretti. In The Western Star, it is revealed that Walt and Martha first got pregnant in 1972, but they lost the baby in a first-trimester miscarriage. Walt's closest friend and confidant is Henry Standing Bear. They have been friends since they were 12 years old, and both went to Vietnam (although Henry was a member of the United States Army Special Forces, while Walt was a Marine MP), where they were both highly decorated. When Cady was born, Walt appointed Henry her godfather. After Cady is assaulted in Philadelphia, Vic (who was assisting the police in the investigation) and Walt have sex. In the aftermath, Walt mentions that he has had sex with only six women in his life. The two continue their relationship after returning to Durant; in A Serpent's Tooth, Walt learns from the doctor that Vic was pregnant, but lost the baby after being stabbed during the confrontation with Tomás Bidarte. As of Any Other Name, neither Walt nor Vic knows that the other is aware of the pregnancy, but in Dry Bones, Vic reveals that she knows Walt had been told. Deputies In the books, Walt is assisted in his duties by a number of deputy sheriffs. * Undersheriff Victoria \\"Vic\\" Moretti, ACSD – Walt's second-in-command and named successor, she moved to Wyoming two years before The Cold Dish with her husband (whom she has since divorced) from South Philadelphia; she has a degree in law enforcement from Temple University and is slowly-but-surely working on her master's degree, and spent over four years as a patrol officer on the Philadelphia Police Department. * Deputy Sheriff Jim Ferguson, ACSD – part-time deputy/head of search and rescue/volunteer fireman; Ferg has been on the job since at least 1988. * Deputy Sheriff Turk Connally, ACSD – Lucian's nephew who Walt hired as a favor to his old boss; he transfers from the Powder Junction Substation to the Wyoming Highway Patrol at the end of The Cold Dish. * Deputy Sheriff Santiago \\"Sancho\\" Saizarbitoria, ACSD – A former corrections officer hired in Death Without Company. He is of Basques descent. * Deputy Sheriff Jess \\"Double Tough\\" Aliff, ACSD – Deputy-in- Charge of the Powder Junction Substation in the southern part of the county; he is badly injured in A Serpent's Tooth. * Deputy Sheriff Chuck Frymier, ACSD – Hired as a deputy for the Powder Junction Substation in the southern part of the county in Kindness Goes Unpunished; he is murdered in A Serpent's Tooth. Walt also frequently consults with T.J. \\"Little Lady\\" Sherwin, the director of the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation's lab unit. Ruby (no family name given) runs the sheriff's office and serves as dispatcher, and retired sheriff Lucian Connally works part-time as the dispatcher on the weekends.

When the series begins, it is believed by most that his wife, Martha Longmire, died of cancer. His father was a rancher who managed the stables of Absaroka County's most wealthy family, the Van Blarcoms. He is a graduate of Durant High School Class of '71, and his football jersey still hangs in the school's trophy case. In their 20s, he and Henry worked at Prudhoe Bay Oil Field in Alaska. Walt has been the Sheriff of Absaroka County since at least 2005; his immediate predecessor is Sheriff Lucian Connally (Peter Weller), the uncle of Branch. In 2010, Walt arrested Malachi Strand (Graham Greene), the Chief of the Cheyenne Reservation Tribal Police, for extortion; he also has an adversarial relationship with the current CRTP Chief, Mathias (Zahn McClarnon), although the two have a bond of mutual respect. In the series Laconic and introspective with a strong sense of duty and justice, Walt is a throwback to the iconic lone hero of classical Westerns. He is an able detective with a knack for finding the truth behind various crimes committed in his county. As the series starts in 2012, Walt is slowly coming out of a deep grieving period where he delegated most of the day-to-day police duties to Deputies Branch Connally (Bailey Chase), Archie \\"The Ferg\\" Ferguson (Adam Bartley), and Victoria \\"Vic\\" Moretti (Katee Sackhoff). This is complicated by Branch running against Walt in the upcoming sheriff election. Walt is investigated by Denver PD Detective Fales (Charles S. Dutton) for the murder of Miller Beck, a meth-head suspected of murdering Walt's wife, Martha. It is revealed that Fales is pushing the case of Beck, a drug-using suspected mugger and killer, so hard because of Fales' own experience with a small-town sheriff, whose racism and abuse of authority left Fales with a deep distrust of those particular law enforcement officers. In 2015, after killing Barlow Connally (Gerald McRaney) on his own front porch, Walt spends six weeks on administrative leave while the death is investigated by the FBI. A number of weeks later, Walt learns that he is being sued for wrongful death by Barlow's estate. As sheriff, Walt carries a Colt Government Model in .45 ACP and a Winchester Model 1894 in .30-30 as his primary weapons, and drives a Ford Bronco as his duty vehicle. He does not own a cell phone (although he will on numerous occasions borrow one from his deputies or Henry) and takes his calls on a land line at home or in the office, or over the radio in his vehicle. =Kill count= In the TV series, Walt has been forced to use deadly force on a number of occasions. # Chance Gilbert's brother – shot # Dan Estes – shot (\\"Pilot\\") # Octavio Mora – shot # Wayne Durell – beaten # Zip – shot # David Ridges – stabbed # Barlow Connally – shot # One of Malachi Strand's Henchmen – shot(\\"Goodbye Is Always Implied\\") # Brian O'Keane – shot(\\"Goodbye Is Always Implied\\") # Malachi Strand – shot(\\"Goodbye Is Always Implied\\") Relationships Walt was married for 25 years to Martha Longmire, with whom he has a daughter, Cady (Cassidy Freeman), an attorney. Martha was diagnosed with cancer in the late 2000s/early 2010s, and died in 2011. Although Walt let everybody (including Cady) assume it was the cancer that took her life, Martha was murdered in an apparent mugging in Denver, Colorado, by a man named Miller Beck. During his own investigation into his wife's death, Walt learned that Beck was hired to kill Martha, and then he was killed shortly thereafter to prevent him from talking to Walt. In \\"High Noon\\", Walt gets a drunken confession out of Barlow Connally, who admits to killing his own son and having Martha murdered; in the ensuing confrontation, Walt fatally shoots Barlow, avenging his deputy and his wife. In \\"Highway Robbery\\", Walt asks out Dr. Donna Sue Monaghan (Ally Walker), a psychiatrist who works for the VA in Sheridan, Wyoming. Walt's closest friend and confidant is Henry Standing Bear. They have been friends since they were 12 years old. When Cady was born, Walt appointed Henry her godfather. Shortly before the show's timeline begins, Walt hired Vic Moretti, a former Philadelphia PD homicide detective, as a deputy sheriff. The two are believed by many to be having an affair, including at one point Vic's husband, Sean Keegan (Michael Mosley). In the Season6 finale Walt and Vic finally realize and admit their feelings for one another, and begin a relationship. Walt's relationship with the Cheyenne Nation is strained, but he is still liked by many members of its community. Deputies In the series, Walt is assisted with his duties by three deputy sheriffs. After Branch's death, Walt hires Zachary Heflin, but fires him after he assaults a rejected deputy applicant who was stalking him. * Deputy Sheriff Branch Connally, ACSD (2008–2014, suspended; killed by Barlow Connally) * Deputy Sheriff Archie \\"The Ferg\\" Ferguson, ACSD (2011–present) * Deputy Sheriff Victoria \\"Vic\\" Moretti, ACSD (2011–present) * Deputy Sheriff Zachary \\"Zack\\" Heflin, ACSD (2015, fired; rehired, 2017) In addition, Deputy Sheriff Eamonn O'Neill was on loan from Cumberland County to assist the office when both Walt and Branch were otherwise occupied, leaving Vic to run day to day affairs. Ruby (no last name specified) runs the sheriff's office and serves as dispatcher. Differences between the books and TV series Among the key differences between the books and the TV series are the character's age and backstory. In the books, it is established that Walt is a college graduate and Vietnam War veteran, and has been the Absaroka County Sheriff since the early 1980s. However, on the TV show, no mention have been made or alluded to of a college or a military career (although those haven't been ruled out, either), and Walt's age has been established multiple times, via his having graduated from high school in 1981 and having been friends with Henry since they were 12 years old, 38 years earlier. In a significant departure from the books, on the show, Walt's wife Martha did not die from cancer. Although she was diagnosed with the disease, in the TV series she was murdered, and the associated details are slowly revealed over several seasons, significantly affecting Walt's relationships with his deputy Branch and the Connally family. While the TV series portrays Vic as being interested in Walt, her feelings aren't reciprocated like they are in the books. Instead, the TV series has Walt slowly recovering from losing his wife, unable or unwilling to maintain a relationship with a woman called Lizzie Ambrose, before finally showing enough interest in a member of the opposite sex to actively court Dr. Donna Sue Monaghan. Only as the show draws to a close does Walt start a relationship with Vic. In the books, Absaroka County sees five murders in 24 years. The TV series sees 27 confirmed murders in the two first seasons alone. Longmire Days In 2012, the first Annual \\"Longmire Days\\" was held in the city of Buffalo, Wyoming, celebrating the series and local community.

It was designed by Tom Cross and built in 1921 by his brothers Frank and Jim Cross. The Memorial was unveiled on 1 August 1922 with Mr A Smith (Chairman of the Esk Shire Council) presiding. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 11 December 2008.  History  The Linville War Memorial is a small timber structure with a terracotta-tiled roof, prominently located in road reserve adjacent to the railway reserve, opposite the store, hotel and Progress Hall. It was designed by Linville photographer, cartoonist, artist and World War I veteran, Tom Cross, and constructed in the early 1920s by his brothers Frank and Jim, with materials donated by the community. The memorial commemorates all local volunteers who served in World War I including eight young men from Linville who did not return. The names of the fallen appear on one side of the panel and are listed in the newspaper article of the unveiling. The Town of Linville is situated on what was earlier part of Colinton Run, taken up by the Balfour Brothers in 1841. Colinton lands were opened for selection in 1897, and closer settlement around what is now Linville intensified following the announcement in 1900 that the Brisbane Valley Branch Railway was to be extended to Moore. The line to Toogoolawah opened on 8 February 1904. Yimbun became the terminus in September 1904 and a further 45k extension was authorised on 1 April 1908, including a climb to Linville. Colinton School was established in 1901, but was renamed Linville in 1906. The Town of Linville was surveyed privately and offered for sale, with the first land transfers occurring from April 1910. The railway line reached the town later in the year. This further cemented the dairying industry in the region allowing easier access to local dairy factories. A sawmill opened in the town in 1912. One of the first selectors in the district was William Cross of Ipswich, who took up Portion 106V in February 1897. In 1898 some of his family moved to the new property, which they named Crossdale. Son Tom was 15 at the time. When his older brother Ben came to live on the family property in 1906, Tom decided to relocate to Ipswich to pursue his artistic interests, taking a job in a photographic studio and producing artworks in his spare time. He later moved to Sydney to study art, while continuing to work in photography. During the Great War (1914–1918) twenty-four Linville men – some as young as 18 – volunteered for service overseas. Eight of them never returned. For the small community of Linville this was a significant loss. Ben and Tom Cross joined the services in 1915. During the war years, Tom became well known for his cartoons and drawings depicting life aboard the troop ships, training in Egypt and scenes of the battlefields of France and Belgium. Some were reproduced as postcards, and he reportedly sold six thousand of these. Others were published in Punch magazine. Many are now held by the Australian War Memorial. Tom suffered from \\"trench feet\\", a form of frostbite, which was to plague him for years after he returned home in 1919. Ben gave his life in the service of his country. During and immediately after the Great War, local communities across Australia began working towards the erection of memorials to those who had served in the war. The impact had been significant with 60,000 men lost from a population of about four million, representing one in five men of those who served. Many were not buried in cemeteries. The construction of a local memorial was often the only tangible reminder of servicemen who lay in graves and battlefields across Europe and the Middle East, and the memorials were considered sacred. Australian War Memorials are unique in that they generally honour all who served, not just those who died. Australians were proud that their first great national army was composed entirely of volunteers. All who served were considered worthy of honour whether or not they made the supreme sacrifice. Many memorials honour all who served from a locality, providing valuable evidence of community involvement in the war. This evidence is not readily available from military records, or from state or national listings, where names are categorised alphabetically or by military unit. Linville is one such memorial. Tom Cross designed the Linville War Memorial, which was built by his brothers Frank, a cabinetmaker, and Jim. Frank managed the project in which all of the materials, labour and construction were donated by local people. The memorial was not completed for ANZAC Day in 1921 as a newspaper article indicates that Linville residents attended the unveiling of Toogoolawah's machine gun trophy on Sunday 24 April 1921. In May 1921, the Linville community was allocated a war trophy. The collection of war trophies was coordinated through the Australian War Records Section and was initially carried out in accordance with the British War Office regulations. The British government assumed it would select the best trophies for the British National War Museum, but the Australian Government objected, insisting that the trophies claimed by their troops should be made available to them. In 1919 it was decided that the Australian War Museum (later the Australian War Memorial) should retain the larger trophies and the smaller ones be distributed to Australian towns according to the size and population of the town. Small towns with a population of between 300 and 3,000, such as Linville, were allocated a machine gun. Consideration was given to allocating trophies captured by units raised in a particular area. Linville was allocated a German machine gun captured in April 1918 by the 9th Battalion to which 5 local men had been attached. The procurement of a war trophy may have expedited the process of building the Linville memorial, because the Queensland State War Trophy Committee specified that a war trophy was to be an integral part of the local memorial. The design of a memorial became contentious also, with New South Wales establishing a War Memorials Advisory Board attempting to influence the design process to stem the tide of \\"inartistic\\" memorials being erected. While Queensland did not regulate design and construction, the Queensland Institute of Architects regretted the \\"deplorable artistic character of many war memorials recently erected in Queensland\\". The design for the Linville War Memorial, prepared by local artist Tom Cross, would have adequately appeased this desire for quality public memorial design. The memorial remains in its original location in the centre of Linville. Repair work to the memorial was commissioned by Somerset Regional Council in 2008.  Description  The Linville War Memorial is a timber structure on a stone and concrete base. It is located in the road reserve and situated parallel to the railway fence, from the fence. It is wide and deep. The pagoda-style roof is clad in terracotta shingles and has terracotta ridge capping. The timber support posts have been set diagonally to allow for four decorative brackets on each corner. The two southern posts appear to be replacements as they are set on metal saddle brackets, whereas the northern posts are set within the curved concrete supports. These supports sit on a concrete slab which then sits on an exposed stonewall footing. Small gardens border the north and south of the footings. The honour board is copper attached to a timber backing board with the roll of honour facing the street (east). A second plaque below this honours those who made the supreme sacrifice. On the western side facing the railway line, back to back with the honour board is a shield – \\"Linville's tribute to the memory of the brave\\". Also on the western face is another plaque describing the machine gun which is set in concrete at base of the memorial: \\"German machine gun captured on the Western Front by the 9th Battalion AIF 11-4-1918\\". The timber supports for the honour board backing board are also in poor repair and in need of remedial work. The machine gun is set in a concrete block painted to resemble sandstone.  Heritage listing  Linville War Memorial was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 11 December 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. War memorials are important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history as they are representative of periods of turmoil and loss that affected communities throughout the State. They provide evidence of an era of widespread Australian patriotism and nationalism, particularly during and following World War 1. The war memorial at Linville, recording the names of the 24 local men who served during the war, one-third of whom did not return, illustrates the impact of this war on one small Queensland rural community, and is indicative of a pattern that occurred throughout the State. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The monument manifests a unique and enduring documentary record of the involvement of the Linville community in an international event. The place is important in demonstrating an uncommon aspect of Queensland's history, being designed by local returned serviceman Tom Cross. The design of the Linville War Memorial is uncommon in Queensland, and being designed by a returned serviceman for his local community was equally uncommon. War memorials of this era were more likely to be the work of a commissioned architect or stonemason. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Linville War Memorial demonstrates the principal characteristics of a World War I memorial: the inclusion of a memorial plaque to local residents who served in World War 1; the integration of the machine gun war trophy into the design; and the prominent location. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The memorial in its setting is of aesthetic significance for its quality of design, workmanship and use of materials. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Linville War Memorial has a strong association with the local community as evidence of a major historic event and a focal point for the remembrance of that event.

In the Hawaiian Language kuokoa means \\"independent\\". The paper was begun in 1861, shortly after David Kalākaua began the first Hawaiian language, national paper entitled; Ka Hoku o Ka Pakipika (Star of the Pacific) edited by Hawaiians for Hawaiian interests. Henry Martyn Whitney, the son of missionaries began Kuokoa to run alongside his other publication, the Pacific Commercial Advertiser soon afterwards. Whitney's two papers followed a similar political ideology from the missionary establishment of the time, however it was popular among the Hawaiian people due to the rich history, genealogies and mele (Hawaiian song) it printed regularly. Whitney himself was heavily influenced by American values, supported annexation, and held the Hawaiian people with little regard. Background Prior to 1820, kānaka ʻōiwi or Native Hawaiians (also called kānaka maoli) had been communicating orally with a memory based history passed down through oral genealogy chants. Missionaries began developing a written Hawaiian language. By 1836 there were two Hawaiian Language newspapers, Lorrin Andrews' seminary publication; Ka Lama Hawaii, and a newspaper called Ke Kumu Hawaii. From 1836 to 1861, newspapers were printed by either Protestant or Catholic publishers or by the Kingdom government. Beginning in 1861, Hawaiian national newspapers would begin to be printed in the Hawaiian language by Native Hawaiians for indigenous Hawaiian interests. Kamehameha III had resisted the Calvinist Church for decades but in later years the missionaries went almost uncontested after the Mahele was forced into place. Kamehameha IV and his brother Lot, Kamehameha V resisted much of the church's politics and felt that church's ideals alone should not rule Hawaii. Kānaka ʻōiwi by this time had begun to feel alienated from the westernization of the kingdom sought by the alii (Nobles of Hawaii) of the time, heavily influenced by political processes such as the Great Mahele and western style, constitutional government. The rise of colonial capitalism and the Calvinist Church was opposed, yet still facilitated by the ruling class. Foreign influence began as advisors and over time became foreign judges, passing judgments on Hawaiians. Schools began to be separated for commoners, teaching in only Hawaiian and preparing students for life as little more than laborers. Class separation became racial separation with foreign land and plantation owners taking much of the land and native kānaka ʻōiwi and the Asian immigrants in the fields. Independent newspapers Henry Martyn Whitney, the son of missionaries, had begun the first independent newspaper in Hawaii called, Pacific Commercial Advertiser in Honolulu on July 2, 1856. The paper had a regular section devoted to content in Native Hawaiian called Ka Hoku Loa O Hawaii (The Morning Star). The section was added to the paper in 1856 as a single page added to the four page Advertiser. The subscription price was six dollars a year and complaints of only having three-fourths of the paper available in English eventually led to the section being removed after the Pacific Commercial Advertiser stopped publishing for a short period. When the paper resumed publication, the Hawaiian section had been removed. In 1859 Henry Parker began a missionary paper called Ka Huko Loa (The Distant Star). Native Hawaiian newspapermen and readers petitioned Parker to publish the paper in Hawaiian but Parker left the Island before anything was accomplished. Both the Ka Hoku Loa and the government paper encouraged colonial support and condemning native culture and practices. On September 26, 1861, Ka Hoku o Ka Pakipika began printing as the first real resistance to the foreign missionary establishment. The paper was started by David Kalakaua, before he ruled. Kalakau would produce several periodicals throughout his life earning him the nickname of the “Editor King”. Immediately the paper was criticized by the missionary establishment, and it was a struggle to survive, even with support. Today these papers have rare content found only in non-English sources. With the resurgence of the Hawaiian renaissance, these sources are in high demand. Publishing start up Ka Nupepa Kuokoa was established by Henry Whitney in order to instruct Kanaka's on how to be more colonialized like the foreign missionaries in a slightly different manner than the Ka Hoku Loa but in direct odds with the aims of Ka Hoku o Ka Pakipika, the independent national paper from Kalakaua. It published Hawaiian moolelo (legends, tales and myth) beginning with Hawaiian language versions of European fairytales from The Brothers Grimm and eventually printing the story of Umi-a-Liloa. It also reported that the old Hawaiian religion was still being practiced in a critical write-up. Regardless of the political ideology of the paper, eventually these moolelo would demonstrate how these papers were used by the indigenous population to speak of and to their own people, as distinct and of the land, as well as rights and justice.

Handel (born 1924) is a Professor Emeritus of Sociology at The City College and The Graduate Center of the City University of New York. He earned A.B., A.M and Ph.D. degrees from The University of Chicago, where he was influenced by the Symbolic Interactionist ideas of George Herbert Mead and Charles Horton Cooley. Career That influence contributed to shaping the research study that resulted in the book Family Worlds (1959) by Hess & Handel. This study of two-parent, first-marriage families with two or three children between the ages of six and eighteen was the first sociological study of families based on interviews with both parents and all the children, leading to an endorsement by University of Minnesota family sociologist Reuben Hill: “breaks new ground in the social psychology of the family.” Handel later published a paper, “Family Worlds and Qualitative Family Research: Emergence and Prospects of Whole Family Methodology” (1996) showing that the concepts and methods developed in Family Worlds were equally applicable to families of any composition, with at least three members, whose members inhabited a shared household over an extended period of time. The original study also reflected the influence of W. Lloyd Warner’s idea of social class; Warner was a teacher of both authors. Handel’s edited book, The Psychosocial Interior of the Family (1967) sought to extend the range of the basic ideas. Handel’s Making a Life in Yorkville: Experience and Meaning in the Life-Course Narrative of an Urban Working-Class Man (2000, 2003) is a symbolic interactionist study of the life course. It presents the unedited text of life-history interviews he conducted with a construction worker, and an analytic framework that seeks to broaden understanding of the life course. Having responsibility for an undergraduate course in social welfare, Handel wrote Social Welfare in Western Society (1982), which conceptualizes social welfare as based on the concept of Help, and argues that social welfare in Western society has been based on five eventually competing concepts of Help: namely, Charity, Public Welfare, Social Insurance, Social Service, and Mutual Aid. The concepts and the socio- political conflicts over them are examined historically, The concluding chapter discusses enduring issues in social welfare. An updated edition appeared in 2009. Handel’s collaborative work includes Children and Society (2005), The Apple Sliced: Sociological Studies of New York City (1984), Qualitative Methods in Family Research (1992), and Workingman’s Wife (1959). He is also the author of numerous journal articles, book chapters, and conference presentations.

History The Roomer idea came from one of the co-founders, Gon, who had to cancel his visit to New York and was obligated to pay a significant cancellation fee for a hotel room that he did not use. As a consequence, there was a pricey hotel reservation that could not be made and cancelled without significant fees. Roomer raised $2 million from the BRM Group, and the Waze co-founder, Uri Levine whose co-founded company acquired by Google for $1 billion, sits on the board of Roomer.

The second round of funding was raised $5 million from Series A by Disruptive on November 25, 2014 as reported by Fox Business. Its rapid expansion is partially the results of the enthusiasm from its customers, since more than 75% of sellers are sharing their stories and experiences on Facebook, Twitter and other social networks.

They may wear large gloves to minimize punch harm or impact on the combatants, headgear, and non-boxing related clothing. Many exhibition fights involve popular current or former world champions, and exhibition bouts are usually carried out for charity purposes or for the public's entertainment. Exhibition fights are usually not listed as having taken place on boxer's career records. In England, such boxers as Jem Mace, Jimmy Wilde and Tommy Farr boxed both official and exhibition bouts at what were called \\"boxing booths\\". In Russia during the early 1890s, aristocrat Mikhail Kister performed at exhibition boxing fights. Early 20th century Early in the 20th century, boxing exhibitions became popular across the United States. Many times, official fights had to be advertised as exhibitions, due to state laws prohibiting professional boxing. As the century progressed, Jack Dempsey, Jack Johnson and others fought exhibition fights. Benny Leonard did an exhibition for the United Drive Rally on May 23, 1923. Late 20th century Exhibition fights became less common as the 20th century progressed. However, a number of notable ones, many including Muhammad Ali, took place. Ali boxed both well known boxers and celebrities from other walks of life during this period, including Michael Dokes, Antonio Inoki, Gorilla Monsoon, Lyle Alzado, Dave Semenko, and the famous Puerto Rican comedian Jose Miguel Agrelot (with Iris Chacon acting as Agrelot's corner-woman). About six months after Ali beat him for the world Heavyweight title, George Foreman participated in five exhibition fights in one afternoon: on April 26, 1975, he boxed Jerry Judge, Boone Kirkman, Charley Polite, Terry Daniels and Alonzo Johnson at Toronto, Ontario, Canada. On January 1, 1985, a show including several world champion boxers in exhibition fights was staged in Mexico City, Mexico to garner money for the victims of a 1984 gas explosion in Mexico. Among those who fought were Lupe Pintor, German Torres, Julio César Chávez and Hector Camacho Sr. The latter two would face each other in an actual official fight on September 1992, which Chávez won by unanimous decision. 21st century In 2006, Mike Tyson announced he would do a world tour consisting of exhibition bouts. The only one of these fights to actually take place was a bout against his former sparring mate and fellow former professional boxer Corrie Sanders (not the Corrie Sanders who held the World Boxing Organization's world Heavyweight title). This fight took place at Youngstown, Ohio. In 2009, recently retired boxer Óscar De La Hoya and basketball player Shaquille O'Neal held an exhibition boxing fight as an episode of the television show Shaq Vs.. Late in 2014, Julio César Chávez returned to the ring for an exhibition with Vicente Sagrestano in a bout aimed at collecting toys for poor children. He and former rival Mario Martinez, against whom he earned his first world championship in 1984, faced each other again on July 3, 2015, in an event to benefit Chavez's two drug rehabilitation clinics.

The Commission's complaints against defendants Kumar, Richards and Woghin allege that, based on this conduct, they violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10(b)-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder. The complaints further allege that under Section 20(e) of the Exchange Act, Kumar, Richards and Woghin aided and abetted Computer Associates' violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder. The 35 day month The fraud, \\"what came to be known by Computer Associates employees as a 35-day month\\", involved backdating of contracts to prop up quarterly revenues and earnings figures to meet market expectations. The SEC said the scheme began in 1998, possibly earlier, and continued through September 2000. In all, the company prematurely reported $3.3 billion in revenues from 363 software contracts. This violated Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, which state that revenues should not be counted until both parties have properly signed a contract. During the four quarters of fiscal 2000, for example, the practice improperly inflated revenues by 25%, 53%, 46% and 22%, respectively. The SEC said the goal was to meet or beat per-share earnings estimates of Wall Street analysts, a key to keeping a company’s stock price rising. The most extreme incident was the second quarter of 2000, when the company reported $557 million in revenues beyond the $1.047 billion it could properly claim. The company thus reported 60 cents in earnings per share, beating the consensus Wall Street forecast of 59 cents. Without the padded revenue, earnings would have been a mere 5 cents per share and the stock price might well have fallen.Wharton University of Pennsylvania: How Serious Was the Fraud at Computer Associates? http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/how-serious-was-the-fraud-at- computer-associates/ In April 2004 Computer Associates International restated $2.2 billion in sales that had improperly during 1999 and 2000.

It was a pioneer in the expansion of Mexican radio, particularly in the creation of radio networks. RPM, known in its final years as Radiodifusión Red, was sold to Grupo Radio Centro in 1994. History RPM began operations on May 31, 1941, a joint venture of Monterrey broadcaster Clemente Serna Martínez, and Azcárraga, who already owned two of Mexico's most popular radio stations: XEW and XEQ. It was the first company to specialize in selling radio programs recorded on vinyl and magnetic tape.Fernando Mejía Barquera, Historia mínima de la radio en México The business model of RPM was incredibly lucrative; it sold the best XEW and XEQ radio programs to stations throughout interior Mexico, offering these small stations programs they could not produce themselves as well as access to national advertising accounts and the ability to charge more for local advertising. RPM began operations with just six affiliates, but it quickly grew to 78 stations by 1945 and 92 stations for 1950, all part of the \\"Cadena Azul\\" (Blue Network). At one point more than half of all the radio stations in Mexico were affiliated to the company,Arturo Merayo Pérez, La radio en Iberoamérica: evolución, diagnóstico, prospectiva. Comunicación Social, 2007: 246. which also had clients in ten Latin American countries.Peter Standish, Steven M. Bell. Culture and Customs of Mexico. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004: 106. The international business continued to flourish into the 1950s; by 1956, RPM had 80 Latin American affiliates and had begun exporting programs to Spain.Michael S. Werner, Concise Encyclopedia of Mexico. Taylor & Francis, 2001: 667. Radio Programas de México was a milestone in the development of Mexican radio, and other affiliate services soon followed. The 1940s also saw the formation of the Cadena Radio Continental, forerunner to Grupo Radio Centro and its OIR unit; Radiodifusoras Unidas Mexicanas (RUMSA); Radiodifusoras Asociadas (RASA); the Cadena Radio Mil; Radio Cadena Nacional, based at XERCN-AM in Mexico City; and others. In 1961, Azcárraga sold his 50 percent stake in RPM to Serna Martínez. By this time, RPM was shifting to a different business, the operation of its own radio stations. This stage of RPM's history began on January 1, 1957, when 660 AM XEBZ was relaunched as XERPM-AM.Cronología IMER While XERPM was sold in the early 1970s to Radio Fórmula, RPM later came to operate other radio stations in Mexico City, especially after acquiring Radio Cadena Nacional in 1973 and transforming 1110 AM into a news and talk radio outlet known as Radio Red. At its height, RPM owned XERPM-AM 660, XERED-AM 1110, XEVIP-AM 1560, XHRED-FM 88.1 and XERPM-FM 103.3. In the late 1970s and 1980s, RPM shrunk in size. XERPM-FM was sold to Radio Fórmula in 1978, while XEVIP-AM was sold to Grupo Radio Centro in 1979. XHRCA-FM 91.3 would join Radio Programas de México in 1986. The Serna family was also active in broadcasting in other cities. They owned Grupo DK, which included multiple AM stations, one FM outlet and a television station, all in Guadalajara. The original concession for XHRIO-TV in Matamoros, Tamaulipas was obtained by the Serna family, though they ultimately did not build the station. In 1994, RPM, which in its final years changed its name to Radiodifusión Red as it became a subsidiary of the new Grupo Medcom, sold to Grupo Radio Centro; the acquisition closed in January 1996. By this time, the company had shed itself of most of the assets that were not related to its Radio Red network, owning five radio stations in total: XHRCA and XHRED-FM, XERED-AM, and XESTN-AM Monterrey and XEDKR-AM Guadalajara, which repeated Radio Red's programming.

It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 April 2009.  History  Monsildale Homestead is a grazing property distinguished by a large timber residence which stands in a picturesque setting on a knoll to the east of Monsildale Road, within a loop of Monsildale Creek. The core section of the main residence was built between 1871 and 1877 on land selected by cattle grazier James Steven during the second phase of the settlement of the Brisbane River Valley, and an extension to the south was added by the Horne family, probably during the 1910s. The property was owned by members of the Horne and Woodrow families between c.1912 and 1978, and although the original cattle station has been subdivided and deer are now farmed close to the main residence, the property still runs cattle. A slab timber combined barn and shed still stands to the southeast of the main residence, and east of the barn is a derelict two-room timber single-men's barrack. At some distance to the south of the main residence is a former quarters for Aboriginal workers, which was later used as a piggery. These structures are characteristic elements of a grazier's homestead complex. The Brisbane River's watershed, of which Monsildale Creek is a part, was one of the earliest areas of Queensland to be settled outside of the Moreton Bay penal settlement. Pastoralists first drove their sheep onto the Darling Downs from New South Wales in 1840, and squatters moved into the Brisbane River Valley the following year. David Cannon McConnel formally established Cressbrook Station in July 1841, and was the first squatter to settle with his stock east of the Great Dividing Range in the future colony of Queensland. He was followed in late 1841 by John Balfour (Colinton Station), the Mackenzie brothers (Kilcoy Station), the Archer brothers (Durundur Station), and the Bigge brothers (Mount Brisbane Station). Pastoralists in the Brisbane River Valley soon switched from sheep to cattle, as sheep were not well suited to the local climate. In 1848 the northern boundary of Colinton Station was described in the New South Wales Government Gazette as running from a marked tree beyond Mount Stanley to a point on the range at the head of Mackenzie's Sheep Station Creek, and thus the site of the Monsildale property may have fallen within the boundary of Colinton Station. It is also reported that at one stage David O'Connel from Cressbrook station considered grazing at Monsildale, but decided against it. Monsildale was apparently named after the property of David's brother Henry in Derbyshire. Little else is known about the history of the land around Monsildale until May 1871, when James Steven applied to select a homestead under the Crown Lands Alienation Act 1868. James Steven is not listed in the 1868 Queensland Alphabetical Post Office Directory, nor is he listed under the Squatters or Cattle Graziers sections in the 1874 or 1876 Trades Directories. However, Monsildale is listed under \\"Stations\\" in the 1878 to 1879 Trades Directory as being run by Swanson and Steven. Alexander Swanson apparently selected Portion 43, some distance to the south of Monsildale homestead, in partnership with James Steven in 1877. Alexander was most likely one of the Swanson brothers who established Yabba Station on the Gympie side of the Jimna Range c.1852. Although it was originally stocked with sheep, Yabba was running cattle by the time it was transferred to the Queensland National Bank in 1882. Two men named Swanson and Stevens supposedly discovered the Jimna goldfield in 1860, when the latter was the head stockman at Yabba. This goldfield was gazetted in 1868, and attracted 1500 men at its peak, although by 1871 the population had dropped to 300. It is possible that James Steven was the head stockman at Yabba Station in 1860, and it can be speculated as to whether or not he made his fortune on the Jimna gold field, given the amount of money later spent on his homestead at Monsildale. The land Steven wanted for his homestead was surveyed by R. Atkinson as Portion 1, Parish of Mount Stanley (later parish of Monsildale), in the County of Canning. In February 1872 it consisted of of Agricultural land and of 1st Class Pastoral land (). During the 1870s Steven selected thousands of acres in the vicinity, including adjacent portions 2, 3, 11 12, 27 and 44, along with Portion 4 to the south, plus other portions. Donald Steven selected Portion 7 opposite Portion 1. Subdivision of the large pastoral runs to the south of Monsildale also began during the 1870s, and in 1876 the first selections at Hazeldean were excised from the Kilcoy Run. In 1877 closer settlement commenced at Villeneuve with the resumptions out of Durundur holdings. In March 1875, in a letter to the Commissioner for Crown Lands for West Moreton, Steven requested that his homestead selection be transferred to a conditional purchase, as \\"it is most likely that other arrangements may soon interfere with my personal residence on the land\\". In April 1876 a letter to the Commissioner from Steven stated that, as he had spent so much money on one selection at Monsildale (Portion 1), it could be argued that he had met the requirements of the 1868 Act for improving his surrounding selections. His selections were inspected in April 1877, and a report on his fulfilment of the selection conditions regarding Portion 1 was issued in July 1877. In this report, Steven's occupation was listed as \\"Grazier\\". Steven applied to purchase in November 1877, and a Deed of Grant was issued in February 1878. Steven's selections were in an isolated valley, and his homestead needed to be self-contained. A list of Steven's improvements to Portion 1, as inspected in April 1877, included the following: a chamferboard house with shingle roof and verandah all round, containing seven rooms and a hall. Lined and ceiled with cedar, with two brick chimneys and spouted all round, it was valued at . There was also a 9000-gallon underground brick and cemented tank and pump valued at ; and a slab and shingle kitchen containing five rooms, with verandahs front and back, built on piles and enclosed underneath, valued at . A slab and shingle store, meat-house, and bathroom with verandah were worth ; and a second slab and shingle kitchen of two rooms and a verandah was valued at . Other outbuildings included a fowl house and piggery (); a blacksmith's shop (); and a stable with three stalls, two loose boxes, a buggy house, a harness room, a corn loft, spouting all around and a large tank (). In addition, there were two men's huts, one of three rooms () and one of two rooms (). Along with various fences and gates, there was also a fenced garden which included fruit trees. Yards included a horse yard, and a milking yard around a calf pen and milking bails. A stockyard enclosed 10 small yards, and included a branding lane, speying bails, a killing yard and gallows. A herding yard was attached. A map of Portion 1 in 1877 shows stockyards near the location of the current stockyards. The existing cattle dip within these yards has the dates 1903 and 1905 carved into posts and rails at the north end of the dip pit. The history of the homestead selection from this time on can be gleaned from the land titles. Although existing titles for Portion 1 only go back as far as 1926, the ownership of neighbouring portions 2 and 12, just outside the loop of Monsildale Creek, gives a fair indication of events at Monsildale prior to 1926. Steven applied to lease Portion 2 before survey in May 1871 and again in November 1871 (as selection 2024). It was leased from January 1872, and a Deed of Grant for its was issued to Steven in February 1878. Steven also applied to lease Portion 12 (selection 2841) before survey in July 1873, and a Deed of Grant for its was issued in March 1878. Most of portions 2 and 12 were combined and subdivided in 1880 to form two new holdings. One () was located to the north of a road leading east from Monsildale Road, and another () was located to the south of this road. In 1882 new joint titles for these holdings were issued to James Steven and Alexander Swanson. In March 1893 both holdings were transferred to the British and Australasian Trust and Loan Company Limited. Information on the history of the district published by the Kilcoy District Historical Society notes that Thomas E. Robertson was at Monsildale in 1895, and that he was listed as property manager from 1904-1908. He was probably employed by the British and Australasian Trust and Loan Company Limited. In 1912 the above holdings were obtained by James Horne, and the titles were transferred to Hornes Limited in 1921. James Horne was born in Newchapel, England in 1861, and he married Elizabeth Maddicks in 1888. Prior to moving to Monsildale the Hornes owned the property Fairlymeade, near Woodford. James Horne also served a term on the Kilcoy Shire Council from 1918. It has been claimed that Horne purchased the Monsildale property in 1908, but this could be confirmed from the titles examined. Portion 1 could have been purchased in 1908, but as pointed out above, the surrounding land was not purchased by Horne until 1912. James Horne is first listed at \\"Monsildale\\" in the 1911-1912 Trades Directory of the Queensland Post Office Directory, under the Pastoral and Agricultural section. At this time he had 33 horses and 502 cattle. Horne family photographs in 1913 and 1914 show quite a large family, and the main residence was probably extended to the south soon after Horne purchased the property. Local knowledge claims that the hut to the south of the homestead at Monsildale (visible in a photograph taken from the south before the homestead was extended) was used as Aboriginal quarters, and there were Aboriginal workers in the area. A photograph taken on Yabba station prior to World War I shows two Aboriginal workers in European dress. Due to shortages of European labour in the nineteenth century, station owners turned to Aboriginal workers, who adapted well to work in the pastoral industry whilst - initially - maintaining aspects of their traditional lifestyle, with the families of workers camping on the stations. By the mid-1880s well over half of the employees on cattle stations in North Queensland were Aboriginal. Later, after a collapse in the Queensland export beef trade in the 1920s led to the removal of non-working dependants from stations and seasonal employment of Aboriginal workers, Aboriginal labour was usually drawn from fringe camps near towns, or from Missions. European and Aboriginal workers were quartered and fed separately, and Aboriginal camps were usually located some distance from the homestead. Aboriginals who were in regular employment and who did not have a strong tie with local Aboriginals might be housed in a station hut. Although cattle-grazing was the main activity at Monsildale, the area's timber was also a source of local economic activity. At various times between 1912 and 1961 sawmills operated on a flat part of Portion 2, just over the creek to the north of the homestead, on land rented from Horne. A small township developed on the site, between the Monsildale Road and Monsildale Creek to the west, including a store, butcher's shop and a school. When Gladys and Vera Horne attended Monsildale School in 1913, their father was listed as a \\"Squatter\\". By 1920 Graham and Vera Horne (née Hunter), and Harry and Grace Woodrow (née Horne) were running Monsildale Station, as James Horne had retired. Harry Woodrow, born in 1885, had married Grace Horne (born 1898) in 1917. Harry worked in the Gympie gold mines between 1901 and 1911 before becoming the first cadet taken on by the Queensland Forestry Department. He then acted as a Forest Ranger in the Little Yabba area near Jimna before working at Monsildale and meeting Grace. After they married, the couple lived at Blackbutt, and then Nanango. In 1920 Grace bought her sisters out of their land in the southern portion of Monsildale, and cleared it of timber. At this time Harry joined Hancock and Gore at Monsildale as their scrub boss, retiring from the Forestry Department. Harry and Grace had a large house of their own, across the road and to the north of the homestead, where they lived for four years. The stumps of this house are still visible. Harry helped to locate and inspect Hancock and Gore's new mill site at Foxlowe, along with Gympie Land Ranger George Carter and Boy MacDonald of Yabba station. Harry was also a Kilcoy Shire Councillor between 1933 and 1946, and was one of the first three trustees of the Jimna Hall, which was built in 1934. The Horne family continued to operate Monsildale as a large cattle property. In the 1923-1924 Trades Directory, Hornes Limited is listed at Monsildale (under the Nanango District) with 1231 cattle, and when Horne's Limited Monsildale Estate was auctioned on 16 May 1924, it consisted of of freehold grazing land (stretching from Portion 24 in the south to Portion 44 in the north) which had been subdivided into 17 farms. About 1000 cattle and 50 horses were also for sale. At the auction, Harry and Grace Woodrow purchased a lot of the land, including the land of former Portion 1. In June 1924 Queensland Trustees Limited was appointed liquidator to wind up Hornes Limited, and the Deed of Grant for Portion 1 was surrendered to the Crown on November 1925, before being re- issued to Queensland Trustees in October 1926. However, the title was then altered to read \\"Hornes Limited, its Successors\\". The same sequence of events occurred for the two holdings outside the loop of Monsildale Creek. Harry and Grace moved into the homestead's main residence after they purchased the former Portion 1. George Atthow bought a block of the Monsildale Estate, and Alf Stanton also purchased two blocks, one of which contained Woodrow's old house, which was removed in 1942. These three blocks were later sold to Harry Runge. In November 1935 that part of the former Portion 1 located east of the Monsildale road (a total of and ), was transferred from Horne's Limited to Harry Woodrow. Harry died in 1956, and the land passed to Grace in 1959. The land was transferred to Grace, James and Robert Woodrow in 1966, and finally to James Woodrow alone in 1976. This land was subdivided in 1978, and the section which contained the homestead complex and within the loop of Monsildale Creek was sold to Peter Kurts Developments Pty Limited before being immediately on-sold to Trevor D. Hawkins in May 1978. The Hawkins used the homestead as a holiday home for children. The house, its outbuildings, and was transferred to Dawn Evans and Ian Mac Lachlan in June 1984, and in 2007 Dawn Evans owned the main residence as part of a 611-acre farm which included parts of former portions 1, 2, 12 and 27. In 2007 the land within the loop of the creek was used to raise deer, and the rest ran beef cattle. The remainder of the homestead land, containing and the stockyards and cattle dip to the north of the homestead, was transferred to Peter Kurts Development Pty Ltd in June 1978, and then immediately transferred to new owners. Grace Woodrow died in 1983, but members of the Woodrow family still farm to the north of Monsildale at \\"Cowah\\". Changes to the main residence over time include the large 1910s extension to the south of Steven's original 1870s residence, and the 1870s section appears to have been was raised off the ground on round logs and stumps, with a new balustrade, at this time. The extension's western verandah balustrade is original, but the balustrade around the original residence has lost its top rail. An extension has also been made to the east side of the verandah around the original residence. The main door in the centre of the north elevation of the 1870s core of the residence has been replaced with a window, and the western chimney has been removed. The central north-south hallway in the core has been incorporated into the north-western room, and the core now includes four rooms (two bedrooms, one lounge, and one study), plus a small southern hall that is open to the western verandah of the 1910s extension. There is also a boxroom on the southern end of the western verandah of the 1870s residence. The southern verandah of the 1910s extension has been enclosed by the current owner, who has also expanded a part of the kitchen to the north. A large coloured-glass window has been added between the kitchen and living room in the 1910s section of the residence. A gate in the fence to the north of the house, and its associated steps, has disappeared, as has a tennis court that used to exist to the west of the house. There is no sign of the 1870s underground brick tank, and its location is not known. The south end of the combined barn and shed to the southeast of the residence was flattened by a falling tree branch in a storm in 2007, and the roof has been reconstructed. The same storm removed the roof and verandah of a two-room single men's barrack located to the east of the garage, and the barrack was knocked off its stumps and was deposited to south. The roof of the former quarters for Aboriginal workers was also lost in the storm.  Description  On the east side of Monsildale Road approximately north-northwest of Kilcoy, Monsildale Homestead occupies undulating land within a loop of Monsildale Creek. Approaching along Monsildale Road, the view is dominated by the homestead's main house and associated outbuildings set within a backdrop of treed mountains, undulating fenced paddocks and lush river flats. The homestead complex consists of the main house, slab barn and shed, single men's barrack and former Aboriginal quarters. There are a number of striking mature trees in the house yard including jacarandas, silky oaks, pines and eucalypts. Monsildale Creek makes a wide loop around the property. A vehicle shed southeast of the barracks is not of heritage significance. The property is entered by a driveway to the west of the residence off Monsildale Road.  Main house  Standing on a grassed knoll, the distinctive white-painted main house consists of the early 1870s core to the north and an L-shaped extension (c.1912) to the south. Timber framed and sheltered by hipped and gabled roofs clad with red painted corrugated iron, the house stands on low timber stumps. Once entered through the main entrance door to the north and organised around a central hall, the house now functions as a series of rooms operating off verandahs which run around the west, north and east of the house. A recently enclosed verandah to the south functions as an informal entrance. The early house comprises a living room, two bedrooms (northeast and southwest), study/library, box room and porch. A short hall links the early house with the extension. The extension consists of a bedroom, living room, office, enclosed verandah and a service wing of kitchen, bathroom, store, toilet and laundry. A wide verandah runs around the west, north and east of the early house, and has dowel balustrading with the handrail sitting on the top rail and bold Y-shaped moulded brackets to the posts. Timber steps alight from the north side and west sides. An extended verandah at the northeast corner has weatherboard infill balustrading. The west and east verandahs to the south extension have dowel balustrading, with a handrail separate from the top rail and only the west verandah has the Y-shaped brackets matching those on the early verandah. There is a batten infill to the understoreys of the early house and the extension. The earlier part of the house is timber-framed, clad with chamferboards and lined with vertical beaded tongue and groove boards in the former hall, to the ceiling of the living room and parts of the porch; and narrower unbeaded boards line the other spaces. The box room, the south wall of the south bedroom and the study in the extension are clad with weatherboards. The early main entrance is infilled with timber boards and a sash window. A doorway from the hall into the east bedroom is infilled with timber boards and infilling to the south wall of the living room indicates the location of an earlier fireplace. The coved ceiling to the south bedroom is lined with beaded timber boards. The south bedroom interior walls and parts of the porch are lined with a textured fibre board over earlier timber boards. The east bedroom has a fireplace with a polished timber surround. The early part of the house is distinguished by wide elaborately moulded skirting boards. French doors (some painted, some varnished) open out onto the verandahs and sash windows have narrow glazing mullions. The extension is of post and rail construction lined with vertical timber boards. Mortice and tenon joints are visible in the window and door framing. Painted French doors open out onto the verandahs. The arrangement of timber boards in the ceiling indicates that the large bedroom may earlier have been two rooms. A large picture window is inserted in the west wall of the living room and a coloured glass window inserted between the living room and kitchen to the east. The kitchen has been upgraded with new joinery, stove and other kitchen equipment and appliances. A narrow verandah with a balustrade infilled with horizontal weatherboards runs along the north of the wing accommodating the kitchen and service areas. The house yard is marked by a low horizontal timber boarded fence painted white.  Slab barn and shed  Standing to the southeast of the main house within the house yard, the slab barn and shed are sheltered by a gable roof recently clad with new corrugated metal sheeting. The timber slabs to the east and north walls are set into bedlogs and notched to take top rails. Sheets of corrugated iron cover a window opening in the east wall and an open doorway stands to the middle of this side of the building. The north elevation has two entrances and a pair of casement windows to the northwest end. The north gable is infilled with weatherboards. The west wall of the barn and shed is clad with weatherboards and has two timber door entrances and a metal tilt-a-door. The south end of the shed is open, timber-framed, partly clad with weatherboards and has a timber floor. The west and south sides of the building stand on low timber stumps. The roof throughout is framed with log beams and sawn timber rafters and battens and is supported by log posts. The floor of the slab barn is dirt to the north with a concrete slab to the middle. A small room with a raised timber floor and internal slab walls to the east and south sits within the barn to the northwest corner. A timber-framed skillion extension to the southeast is clad with weatherboards and accommodates a small office and storage room. The slabs are painted with red oxide and weatherboards are white painted.  Single men's barrack  East of the slab barn and shed, the roofless remains of the single men's barrack stand on temporary props, the building having been dislodged from its stumps during a violent storm. Rectangular in plan, the barrack consists of two rooms each entered by a door from the south and separated by an internal partition with a single doorway between the rooms. The building is timber-framed, has a timber floor, is clad with weatherboards and unlined except for vertical timber boards around the north window in the west room. There is a window with sunhood to each short end and to each room on the north side. Salvaged roof framing and sheeting is stacked adjacent to the propped building (one piece of roof sheeting remains caught high in a nearby tree).  Aboriginal quarters  The former Aboriginal quarters is a timber-framed building, once sheltered by a gable roof with skillion roofs extending to the north and south, that stands in a paddock some south of the main house. The roof framing and corrugated iron roof sheeting has blown off in a violent storm and lies stacked nearby. The north wall is constructed of vertical timber slabs set into a bedlog and notched to take a top rail; a concrete half wall stands to the west, and the south and east walls are clad with corrugated galvanised iron. The building has concrete floors, upstands and drains, and metal gates and fences remaining from its use as a piggery.  Other structures  The cattle dip and yards once associated with the homestead are extensively altered and not included within the heritage listing.  Heritage listing  Monsildale Homestead was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 April 2009 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Monsildale Homestead is a product of the second phase of settlement in the Brisbane River Valley, an early and important area of cattle-raising in Queensland. Monsildale was settled in the 1870s, at a time when parts of the nearby large squatter's runs of the 1840s were being resumed for closer settlement under the Crown Lands Alienation Act 1868. The establishment of Monsildale run reflected both the push towards closer settlement at the time and also the conflicting need to aggregate selections to form viable cattle runs. The land has been in continuous use for pastoral purposes since the 1870s. Although the size of the station's land holdings has varied over the years, and the property surrounding the main residence has shrunk to , grazing still occurs on Monsildale homestead and on its former lands to the north and south. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Monsildale Homestead with its complex of structures and yards including the main residence (1870s, with 1910s extension), slab barn and shed (pre-1910s), single men's barracks, and Aboriginal workers' quarters (sited at a distance from the main buildings, pre 1910s) comprises elements typical of a grazier's homestead complex. The main residence in its layout and use of a range and quality of timbers and construction techniques is a good example of a substantial late 19th-century grazier's home expanded in the early 20th century to accommodate a large family.

If we want to test the locations of multiple sequences of such variables, Šidák correction should be applied in order to calibrate the level of the Student's t-test. Moreover, if we want to test the locations of nearly infinitely many sequences of variables, then Šidák correction should be used, but with caution. More specifically, the validity of Šidák correction depends on how fast the number of sequences goes to infinity. Introduction Suppose we are interested in different hypotheses, H_{1},...,H_{m} , and would like to check if all of them are true. Now the hypothesis test scheme becomes : H_{null} : all of H_{i} are true; : H_{alternative}: at least one of H_{i} is false. Let alpha be the level of this test (the type-I error), that is, the probability that we falsely reject H_{null} when it is true. We aim to design a test with certain level alpha . Suppose when testing each hypothesis H_{i}, the test statistic we use is t_{i}. If these t_{i}'s are independent, then a test for H_{null} can be developed by the following procedure, known as Šidák correction. :Step 1, we test each of null hypotheses at level 1-(1-alpha)^frac{1}{m} . :Step 2, if any of these null hypotheses is rejected, we reject H_{null} . Finite case For finitely many t-tests, suppose Y_{ij}=mu_{i}+epsilon_{ij}, i=1,...,N, j=1,...,n, where for each , epsilon_{i1},...,epsilon_{in} are independently and identically distributed, for each epsilon_{1j},...,epsilon_{Nj} are independent but not necessarily identically distributed, and epsilon_{ij} has finite fourth moment. Our goal is to design a test for H_{null}: mu_{i}=0, forall i=1,...,N with level . This test can be based on the t-statistic of each sequences, that is, : t_{i}=frac{bar{Y}_{i}}{S_{i}/sqrt{n}}, where: : bar{Y}_{i}=frac{1}{n}sum_{j=1}^{n}Y_{ij}, qquad S_{i}^{2}=frac{1}{n}sum_{j=1}^{n}(Y_{ij}-bar{Y}_{i})^{2}. Using Šidák correction, we reject H_{null} if any of the t-tests based on the t-statistics above reject at level 1-(1-alpha)^{frac{1}{N}}. More specifically, we reject H_{null} when : exists i in {1,ldots,N} : t_{i}> zeta_{alpha,N}, where : P(Z>zeta_{alpha,N})=1-(1-alpha)^{frac{1}{N}}, qquad Zsim N(0,1) The test defined above has asymptotic level , because : begin{align} text{level} &= P_{null} left (text{reject } H_{null} right)  &= P_{null} left(exists i in {1,ldots,N} : t_{i}>zeta_{alpha,N} right )  &= 1-P_{null} left (forall i in {1,ldots,N} : t_{i}leqzeta_{alpha,N} right )  &=1-prod_{i=1}^{N}P_{null} left (t_{i}leqzeta_{alpha,N} right )  &to 1-prod_{i=1}^{N}P left (Z_{i}leqzeta_{alpha,N} right ) && Z_{i}sim N(0,1)  &=alpha end{align} Infinite case In some cases, the number of sequences, N , increase as the data size of each sequences, n , increase. In particular, suppose N(n)rightarrow infty text{ as } n rightarrow infty . If this is true, then we will need to test a null including infinitely many hypotheses, that is : H_{null}: text{ all of } H_{i} text{ are true, } i=1,2,.... To design a test, Šidák correction may be applied, as in the case of finitely many t-test. However, when N(n)rightarrow infty text{ as } nrightarrow infty, the Šidák correction for t-test may not achieve the level we want, that is, the true level of the test may not converges to the nominal level alpha as n goes to infinity. This result is related to high-dimensional statistics and is proven by Fan, Hall and Yao (2007). Specifically, if we want the true level of the test converges to the nominal level alpha , then we need a restraint on how fast N(n)rightarrow infty . Indeed, * When all of epsilon_{ij} have distribution symmetric about zero, then it is sufficient to require log N = o (n^{1/3}) to guarantee the true level converges to alpha . * When the distributions of epsilon_{ij} are asymmetric, then it is necessary to impose log N = o(n^{1/2}) to ensure the true level converges to alpha . * Actually, if we apply bootstrapping method to the calibration of level, then we will only need log N = o (n^{1/3}) even if epsilon_{ij} has asymmetric distribution. The results above are based on Central Limit Theorem. According to Central Limit Theorem, each of our t-statistics t_{i} possesses asymptotic standard normal distribution, and so the difference between the distribution of each t_{i} and the standard normal distribution is asymptotically negligible. The question is, if we aggregate all the differences between the distribution of each t_{i} and the standard normal distribution, is this aggregation of differences still asymptotically ignorable? When we have finitely many t_{i} , the answer is yes. But when we have infinitely many t_{i} , the answer some time becomes no. This is because in the latter case we are summing up infinitely many infinitesimal terms. If the number of the terms goes to infinity too fast, that is, N(n) rightarrow infty too fast, then the sum may not be zero, the distribution of the t-statistics can not be approximated by the standard normal distribution, the true level does not converges to the nominal level alpha , and then the Šidák correction fails.

It was built . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Homestead on Kilcoy Station, 1902 Kilcoy Homestead, a single-storeyed, substantial brick residence, was constructed c.1857, for the Hon. Louis Hope, British aristocrat and Queensland grazier, sugar plantation owner and politician. The remnants of the early brick cottage on the site, also erected for Hope, date to the mid-1860s. Sir Evan Mackenzie The Kilcoy run had been taken up as a sheep station by brothers Evan and Colin Mackenzie, of Kilcoy, Scotland, who had started clearing the land and erecting huts by early July 1841. In October that year they secured the run officially, taking out the second pastoral licence issued for the Upper Brisbane Valley. In the New South Wales Government Gazette of 11 May 1848, Kilcoy was described as comprising over , bounded on the south by Frederic and Francis Bigge's Mt Brisbane Station, on the east by the Archers' Durundur Station, on the west by John Balfour's Colinton run, and to the north by the mountains separating Wide Bay from the Brisbane Valley. Establishment of Kilcoy station was resisted by the indigenous population, and the run is infamous for the mass poisoning of Aborigines that occurred there in February 1842. As on most early stations, the first Kilcoy head station, erected in mid-1841, was a simple slab hut. In 1844 this was replaced by a brick dwelling, described in February 1845 as containing five rooms – one a large sitting room and four bedrooms opening from the parlour – with a verandah in front. The kitchen, which may have been the early slab dwelling, stood about from the rear of the new residence, and was demolished . leftAlthough Colin Mackenzie remained in Moreton Bay and the Darling Downs until about 1857, Evan Mackenzie left Moreton Bay in mid-1845. Their Kilcoy run was transferred to Charles A Atherton in 1849, then to the Hon. Louis Hope and Robert Ramsay in 1853. Whether Ramsay ever worked the station is not clear; Hope was running it with the assistance of a superintendent by October 1857, when bricks were being fired on the property in preparation for the construction of his new residence, the present homestead. The 1844 residence was white-ant ridden, and is understood to have been demolished when the house was completed. In 1863, Hope purchased Ramsay's interest in Kilcoy. Hope had arrived in New South Wales in 1843, was an active participant in early Queensland economic and political life, and was instrumental in the development of the sugar industry in Queensland. In the 1850s he purchased and/or leased extensive landholdings in the Moreton region, including Kilcoy Station in 1853, Shafston House at Kangaroo Point in 1854, and land at Cleveland, 1852-55. Hope's Cleveland property, Ormiston House Estate, was being farmed by , and in the early 1860s he experimented there first with cotton, then sugar cane, establishing Queensland's first sugar plantation at Ormiston. In 1864-65, Hope erected at Ormiston a substantial brick residence, not unlike the Kilcoy homestead, but more ornate. From this time the Hope family lived principally at Ormiston House, the homestead at Kilcoy became the manager's residence, and a brick cottage was built at Kilcoy for use by Louis Hope on his frequent visits to the property. Jeremiah Kennedy William Butler was appointed manager of Kilcoy in 1871, commencing an association with Kilcoy that lasted over 50 years. In 1882 the Hopes returned to England, leaving Kilcoy and Ormiston, which was rented out, under Butler's supervision. At Kilcoy, Butler established excellent relationships with local Aborigines, and after his death a Kilcoy street was named after him and a monument erected in his honour. Louis Hope died in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1894, but Kilcoy Homestead remained the property of his heirs until 1908, when the house on freehold was purchased by William Butler. Local grazier Jeremiah Kennedy of Monte Cassino, acquired the homestead in 1924. Kennedy was very involved in local government and, like previous owners, committed to horseracing. Kilcoy Homestead remains the property of the Kennedy family, but a caretaker has been in residence for many years.  Description  Homestead and property, 2015 Homestead at Kilcoy Station, ca. 1932 Kilcoy Homestead, a single-storeyed brick residence with a hipped corrugated iron roof, is located at the end of a ridge to the north of Kilcoy, overlooking Kilcoy Creek and surrounding farmland. The building, reflecting a strong Georgian influence in its design, is approached from the southwest via a driveway along the ridge top. The building, L-shaped in plan, is constructed of English Bond brickwork and is surrounded by verandahs with the southern side being enclosed. French doors with shutters open onto verandahs which have unlined corrugated iron skillion roofs and timber posts. The main entry is positioned centrally on the northeast, with a set of brick steps accessing the verandah to a flat arched doorway with double cedar panelled doors with fanlight and sidelights opening to the entrance hall. A matching doorway accesses the entrance hall from the enclosed rear verandah. The building's core is one room deep, with the northeast wing consisting of a central entry hall, a bedroom on the north, a living room on the south, store rooms at the southern end and brick lean-to store rooms at the rear. The rear wing has one large bedroom, an enclosed verandah on the south housing a kitchen and a brick lean-to at the rear housing a bathroom. Internally, the walls are plastered, the ceilings are boarded and skirtings, doors and architraves are of cedar. The entry hall has unset sandstone flagging to the floor and other principal rooms have boarded floors. The two northeast rooms have fireplaces with timber surrounds. The kitchen and bathroom are later alterations. The southern store rooms have a loft space, and a basement wine cellar which is no longer accessible. The lean-to store rooms at the rear, one being the former lamp room, have concrete floors. The homestead grounds include mature Bunya Pines, with other plantings of native and European trees. A terraced area to the northeast of the building may be the site of an early tennis court. The remains of a brick shed is located to the southwest of the building. This consists of two side walls, the northern one housing a fireplace, with a freestanding gable roof supported on metal posts. A former railway station building, titled WINYA and constructed of weatherboard with a corrugated iron gable roof, has been moved onto the site and is located between the homestead and the brick shed. A dairy and stables, constructed of brick and timber with a corrugated iron gable roof, is located further to the southwest alongside the driveway.  Heritage listing  Kilcoy Homestead was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Kilcoy Homestead is significant to Queensland history because it is one of the oldest surviving homesteads in the Brisbane Valley, and in Queensland. Built for a prominent Queensland pioneer, the Hon. Louis Hope, MLC, it has a close connection with 19th-century Queensland pastoral development, and in particular with the growth of the pastoral industry in the Brisbane Valley. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Kilcoy Homestead is significant because it is a rare, well- preserved, substantial, late 1850s brick homestead, illustrating a class of buildings which were rare in Queensland at the time of construction, and are even more rare now. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. In its use of local hand-made bricks and timber from the property, Kilcoy Homestead is illustrative both of the constraints placed upon early Queensland pioneers in their attempts to \\"civilise\\" their bush environment, and of the means and methods adopted to overcome these constraints. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Kilcoy Homestead, a fine example of an 1850s residence reflecting a strong Georgian design influence, together with its dramatic siting and stand of mature trees, imbues a sense of landmark in the surrounding landscape. The simple detailing and interior finishes of the homestead expresses quality of design and workmanship. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Since 1922 it has been associated with the Kennedy family and their long-standing contribution to the Brisbane Valley community.

Because the CTBUH ranks the world's tallest buildings by height to pinnacle, a number of buildings appear higher in the rankings than they otherwise would due to extremely long spires. The controversy began when the Petronas Towers were named as the world's tallest buildings in 1998, despite having a roof 63.4 m (208 ft) lower than that of the Willis Tower. The current world's tallest building, Burj Khalifa, is officially 828 meters tall, but its highest usable floor is 585m above ground. Therefore, its vanity height is defined as 244 meters, or 29% of the building's total height. Without this vanity height the Burj Khalifa would still be the tallest building in the world, but only by a mere 2 meters over the Shanghai Tower.https://www.skyscrapercenter.com/building/shanghai-tower/56 The next potential tallest building, the Jeddah Tower, could be over 1,000 meters tall but its highest floor is 630m above ground. The top 370m (equivalent to an 85-story building) or 37% of the building's total height is unusable. When vanity height is excluded, the height progression of the world's tallest buildings looks much more modest in comparison. The CTBUH requires a structure's vanity height to be under 50% to be defined as a \\"building.\\" Otherwise, it is considered a communications tower and ineligible for the rankings.

It was built from 1901 to 1917. It is also known as Bank of Queensland Ltd, National Bank of Australasia, and now as a dental surgery. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  This small timber building was erected in Main Street, Lowood, between 1901 and 1917, as a branch of the Royal Bank of Queensland Ltd. Lowood had emerged as the centre of a thriving farming district after the rail link to Ipswich was opened in mid-1884. In 1901 the Royal Bank, established in Brisbane in 1885 as a competitor to the Queensland National Bank, opened a branch at Lowood. For the first two decades of the 20th century it remained the only banking establishment in the town. Relocating the bank, 1917 In January 1917 the Royal Bank and the Bank of North Queensland (established in Townsville in 1888) merged to form the Bank of Queensland Ltd, with the Lowood branch retained under the new name. In mid-1917 the Lowood bank building, complete with a brick and concrete strongroom which weighed close to 40 tonnes, was re-located to the present site in Railway Street. In 1922 the Bank of Queensland in turn merged with the National Bank of Australasia, and the building remained a branch of the National Bank until 1986. In 2015, it functions as a dental surgery.  Description  Bank of Queensland in Lowood, 1922 This single-storeyed weatherboard building fronts Railway Street in the centre of Lowood. Rectangular in plan, the building has a corrugated iron hipped roof with a shallow hip to the front verandah and a skillion to the rear office and workroom. The building sits on concrete stumps with the verandah at street level and the land sloping away to the rear. The verandah has decorative carved timber arch brackets with corner quatrefoil design and cross-braced balustrade with a circular pattern. The ceiling is lined and a projecting vestibule has twin timber doors with a fanlight above. The interior has tongue and groove boards to the walls, a flat boarded ceiling and partitioning has been installed to separate the surgery, reception and a toilet. The building has double-hung sash windows and a rendered masonry strongroom is built into the southeast elevation adjacent to the surgery and is used as a store. A metal sheeted shed sitting on metal posts and a weatherboard and fibrous cement toilet block are located to the rear of the building. Metal sunshades are attached to the northwest and southeast elevations.  Heritage listing  The former Royal Bank of Queensland at Lowood was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Royal Bank of Queensland Ltd building at Lowood is important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history, being associated with the rural expansion of the Royal Bank of Queensland in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. It is important in demonstrating some of the principal characteristics of a small, early 20th century, timber bank building in rural Queensland, retaining a substantially intact exterior and what appears to be the original masonry strongroom. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. It exhibits aesthetic characteristics valued by the local community, in particular the streetscape contribution of its decorative timber facade.

Biography Ziegler began his undergraduate studies at the Rhode Island School of Design, later transferring to the Kansas City Art Institute. He earned an MFA from the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia in 1982. Born in Campbelltown, Pennsylvania, Ziegler currently lives and works in Nashville, Tennessee, where he is the current chair of the Department of Art at Vanderbilt University, and where he was also the host of the 2014 National Arts Administrators' conference. Throughout his career, Ziegler’s practice has examined the role of art in public space, the socially-constructed dimensions of our natural environment, the value of manual labor, and the importance of collaboration between the artist and the broader community. Ziegler has exhibited nationally and internationally and has presented solo exhibitions at venues including: Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal in 1998; Artpace, San Antonio, in 1999; Secession, Vienna in 2003; and Bemis Center for Contemporary Arts, Omaha, Nebraska in 2014. Reviewing his 2014 exhibition “An American Conversation” at the Bemis Center for Contemporary Arts, Daniel Tidwell writes in Nashville Arts magazine: “[Ziegler] is part historian, conceptual artist, sociologist, and aspiring farmer—creating work that occupies a unique place in the art world, bridging political, historical, and social concerns—mining the buried histories and narratives of the American landscape.” He has been the recipient of numerous awards and fellowships, including being a Loeb Fellow at the Harvard School of Design in 1997; having been recognized by the Joan Mitchell Foundation with a 1997 painters and sculptors' grant, and the 2013 Joan Mitchell Center AIR program; being a 2000 Creative Capital (Visual Arts) Fellow; and being the recipient of National Endowment for the Arts, Art Works grants in 1989 and 1993. His work is held in many public and private collections, including the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, New York; Albright-Knox Museum, Buffalo, New York; Tang Museum, Skidmore College; Los Angeles County Museum of Art; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; San Diego Museum of Art; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; Rose Art Museum, Brandeis University; Des Moines Art Center, Iowa; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Texas. Mel Ziegler has recently established the Sandhills Institute,“a catalyst for the creation of civically-engaged integrated art in and around the agricultural community” on the historic Davis Pine Creek Ranch near Rushville in north-west rural Nebraska, where he hosted a short form field trip residency for artists in June 2015. “International Art World Comes to Rushville, Nebraska” Sheridan County Journal Star, Thursday, 28 May 2015 Early career Kate Ericson and Mel Ziegler were influential collaborators in social interventionist art, beginning officially as a team in 1985 and continuing until Ericson died of brain cancer in 1995. In 1988 their work was exhibited at both the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the Hirshorn in Washington D.C., and was the subject of a major retrospective accompanied by a significant publication, \\"America Starts Here\\" at the MIT List Center for the Visual Arts in 2006. The exhibition was organized by curators Bill Arning, then at MIT List Visual Arts Center, and Ian Berry, the Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery at Skidmore College, and toured to Austin Museum of Art, Texas, H&R; Block Artspace at the Kansas City Art Institute, and Contemporary Art Center, Cincinnati. Together, Ericson and Ziegler made site-specific installations and objects concerned with mapping trajectories, questioning history, and highlighting the specificity of places and communities. As a collaborative duo, Ericson / Ziegler's work was integral to the emergence of integrated practice and community engagement as vital forms of contemporary art.

Algorithms are known for decomposing univariate polynomials in polynomial time. Polynomials which are decomposable in this way are composite polynomials; those which are not are called indecomposable polynomials of sometimes prime polynomials.J.F. Ritt, \\"Prime and Composite Polynomials\\", Transactions of the American Mathematical Society 23:1:51–66 (January, 1922) (not to be confused with irreducible polynomials, which cannot be factored into products of polynomials). The rest of this article discusses only univariate polynomials; algorithms also exist for multivariate polynomials of arbitrary degree.Jean- Charles Faugère, Ludovic Perret, \\"An efficient algorithm for decomposing multivariate polynomials and its applications to cryptography\\", Journal of Symbolic Computation, 44:1676-1689 (2009), Examples In the simplest case, one of the polynomials is a monomial. For example, :f = x^6 - 3 x^3 + 1 decomposes into :g = x^2 - 3 x + 1 text{ and } h = x^3 since :f(x) = (g circ h)(x) = g(h(x)) = g(x^3) = (x^3)^2 - 3 (x^3) + 1, using the ring operator symbol ∘ to denote function composition. Less trivially, : begin{align} & x^6-6 x^5+21 x^4-44 x^3+68 x^2-64 x+41  = {} & (x^3+9 x^2+32 x+41) circ (x^2-2 x). end{align} Uniqueness A polynomial may have distinct decompositions into indecomposable polynomials where f = g_1 circ g_2 circ cdots circ g_m = h_1 circ h_2 circ cdotscirc h_n where g_i eq h_i for some i. The restriction in the definition to polynomials of degree greater than one excludes the infinitely many decompositions possible with linear polynomials. Joseph Ritt proved that m = n, and the degrees of the components are the same, but possibly in different order; this is Ritt's polynomial decomposition theorem.Capi Corrales-Rodrigáñez, \\"A note on Ritt's theorem on decomposition of polynomials\\", Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra 68:3:293–296 (6 December 1990) For example, x^2 circ x^3 = x^3 circ x^2. Applications A polynomial decomposition may enable more efficient evaluation of a polynomial. For example, : begin{align} & x^8 + 4 x^7 + 10 x^6 + 16 x^5 + 19 x^4 + 16 x^3 + 10 x^2 + 4 x - 1  = {} & (x^2 - 2) circ (x^2) circ (x^2 + x + 1) end{align} can be calculated with only 3 multiplications using the decomposition, while Horner's method would require 7. A polynomial decomposition enables calculation of symbolic roots using radicals, even for some irreducible polynomials. This technique is used in many computer algebra systems.The examples below were calculated using Maxima. For example, using the decomposition : begin{align} & x^6 - 6 x^5 + 15 x^4 - 20 x^3 + 15 x^2 - 6 x - 1  = {} & (x^3 - 2) circ (x^2 - 2 x + 1), end{align} the roots of this irreducible polynomial can be calculated as :1 pm 2^{1/6}, 1 pm frac{sqrt{-1 pm sqrt{3}i}}{2^{1/3}}.Where each ± is taken independently. Even in the case of quartic polynomials, where there is an explicit formula for the roots, solving using the decomposition often gives a simpler form. For example, the decomposition : begin{align} & x^4 - 8 x^3 + 18 x^2 - 8 x + 2  = {} & (x^2 + 1) circ (x^2 - 4 x + 1) end{align} gives the roots : 2 pm sqrt{3 pm i} but straightforward application of the quartic formula gives equivalent results but in a form that is difficult to simplify and difficult to understand: : 2-{ frac{sqrt{{{ 9 left(frac{8 sqrt{10} i}{3^{3/2}} + 72right)^{2/3} + 36 left(frac{8 sqrt{10} i}{3^{3/2}} + 72right)^{1/3} + 156} over {left({frac{8 sqrt{10} i}{3^{3/2}}} + 72right)^{1/3}}}}} 6}-{{sqrt{-left(frac{8 sqrt{10} i}{3^{3/2}} + 72right)^{1/3}-{{52}over{3 left(frac{8 sqrt{10} i}{3^{3/2}} +72right)^{1/3}}} + 8}}over 2} . Algorithms The first algorithm for polynomial decomposition was published in 1985,David R.

Biography David Griffiths grew up in South Dakota after his family emigrated there from his birthplace of Aberystwyth, Wales. He attended South Dakota Agricultural College, receiving both a B.A. (1892) and an MSc (1893) from that institution. For a few years after leaving college, he taught high school science classes. In 1898, he began doctoral studies at Columbia University, focusing on fungi and publishing on such agriculturally important fungal diseases as powdery mildew, ergots, and smuts. After gaining his Ph.D. degree in 1900, he became a professor of botany at the University of Arizona Experiment Station, where he studied desert plants. A year later, he moved to the Bureau of Plant Industry of the United States Department of Agriculture, where he would spend a decade and a half as a specialist on grasses in charge of field management of the Grass and Forage Plant Investigations unit of the bureau. For the bureau, he traveled around northern Mexico and the United States studying and collecting native grasses and range plants, ultimately assembling an enormous collection at the Plant Introduction Garden in Chico, California. In 1901 alone, he traveled over 700 miles between Nevada and Oregon, and he took some of the earliest known photos of the Great Basin that were intended specifically to record conditions out on the range. In this period, the fencing-in of the west over the previous half century had pushed sheep and cattle onto ever-smaller areas of rangeland, resulting in overstocking that had damaged the land. Griffiths' researches were part of a drive by the USDA to help find ways to improve range management in the western states. In the course of his researches, Griffiths became especially interested in plants adapted to low-water environments such as prickly pear cactus that could be used as supplemental or emergency feed for livestock. As a result of his investigations into the cultivation potential of these kinds of food sources, he became an authority an cacti, assembling a collection of well over 3000 members of the cactus genus Opuntia. Under his supervision, the botanical illustrator Louis Charles Christopher Krieger painted a series of watercolors of his Opuntia collection. The year Griffiths died, his cactus collection (as well as his photographs of cacti) was donated to the United States National Museum. In his final two decades, Griffiths focused on bulbous plants both native and imported, becoming a senior horticulturalist for USDA's research on bulb production. He authored a series of booklets on cultivation bulbs in general and of daffodils, narcissus, tulips, lilies, and hyacinths in particular. Honors Griffiths was honored for his work on grasses by having an entire grass genus named after him, Griffithsochloa (now Bouteloua) .

She was a radical for her time, advocating for birth control, the intellectual parity of men and women, and economic security among many other issues. She began her career as a social reformer under the guidance of the Methodist church's Social Gospel but moved more radically to the left when it became apparent from her work with immigrants and laborers that the church was not supportive of social and economic reforms. She was one of the early members of the Brandon Labor Church and was a founder of both the People's Forum Speaker's Bureau and the Labor Women's Social and Economic Conference, the latter of which was merged into the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (Manitoba Section). Though she was one of the founders of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation she was unsuccessful in several attempts to win a seat in the Manitoba legislature. In addition to her many programs for women, Brigden also was one of the founders of the Indian-Métis Friendship Centres. Her biographer, Allison Campbell wrote of her: \\"By the standards of her time, to be ambitious, deliberately single, determinedly self-supporting and continuously outspoken was cause enough to be labeled as a radical.\\" Social reform was not a side-line to her wifely duties, it was her career.\\"Campbell (1991)\\", p 155 Biography Beatrice Alice Brigden was born 30 January 1888 in Hastings, Ontario, Canada to William Brigden and Sarah Jane Wood. When she was one year old her family moved to a farm about 20 miles north of Deloraine, Manitoba. In 1908, Brigden began her schooling at Albert College in Belleville, Ontario, studying arts and vocal expression. After one year, she transferred to Brandon College, and in 1910 received a diploma from the Department of Expression and Physical Culture for proficiency in public speaking. A year later she began studying at The Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto. In Toronto, part of the student's training was to visit local factories and hospitals, likely with an eye to providing the workers and patients with \\"uplifting entertainment.\\" Instead, it ignited Brigden's awareness of injustice and gave birth to her social conscience. She saw first- hand the unsanitary conditions, slave-like working conditions, and drudgery of the working classes.\\"Campbell (1991)\\", pp 50-51 She graduated with a degree in psychology and vocal expression from the Conservatory in 1912. During the year that she studied in Brandon, her family relocated there and she remained in that community, until the 1930s.\\"Campbell (1991)\\", p 20 Brigden's mother was a Quaker and her influence was strongly seen in the development of her ideas on political participation, pacifism and sexual equality, but her father's Methodism had the most immediate impact economically.\\"Campbell (1991)\\", p 23 She joined several organizations, including the Women's Missionary Society, the Epworth League, the church choir, and the temperance organization, the Royal Templars, assuming positions of leadership to gain skills and learn about administration and command.\\"Campbell (1991)\\", p 46 These organizations were steeped in the teachings of social gospel, providing a religious rationale for addressing social concerns and building a moral foundation, which could then address improvements in economic and social situations.\\"Campbell (1991)\\", p 42 In this atmosphere, Brigden began negotiating with the Methodist Church to teach social purity in 1913. In 1914, they agreed to terms and Brigden began training in La Crosse, Wisconsin as a Methodist social service worker,\\"Campbell (1991)\\", p 60 under a self-directed study of laws governing sexual behavior and books on the psychology of sex.\\"Campbell (1991)\\", p 65 Her studies led her to a different focus than her Methodist employers. They wanted to redeem souls, and while she saw that as important, Brigden acknowledged that addressing economic shortfalls was imperative for real change, foreshadowing her later move into politics. One of the influences for her divergence at this early stage was Jane Addams, who Brigden visited at Hull House, over her employer's objections.\\"Campbell (1991)\\", p 66 There were few, if any, women's predecessors in the Methodist social worker pool and Brigden was responsible for arranging her own itinerary, as well as writing her own lectures and creating the promotional materials she needed.\\"Campbell (1991)\\", p 64 Some of her lectures were presented as social service pamphlets by the church.\\"Campbell (1991)\\", p 62 Her focus for the lectures was on women, as she was prohibited from addressing men, and as was dictated by the times, the lectures did not address men's responsibility for their behaviors but rather trained women to be the \\"guardians of virtue\\".\\"Campbell (1991)\\", p 71 Her topics were considered shocking at the time: alcoholism, sexually transmitted diseases,\\"Campbell (1991)\\", p 56 unwed mothers, women's equal right to participate in work, the right to birth control and choice to determine family size.\\"Campbell (1991)\\", p 19 She spent six years lecturing on sex education and social ills throughout Canada. Increasingly, Brigden found herself turning away from the church and more toward socialism.\\"Campbell (1991)\\", p 86 After WWI ended, she questioned the purpose of war and attributed a lack of commitment to peace and disarmament in part to the church's failure to support peace and speak out about the harm of war.\\"Campbell (1991)\\", p 97 She was seen as a radical by conservative church members who did not believe that the church's mission extended beyond spiritual spheres.\\"Campbell (1991)\\", p 82 These concerns were compounded by the lack of the Methodist Church to provide any meaningful response to help the strikers of Winnipeg General Strike of 1919 and their supporters from Brandon, Manitoba and her continuing concern about the limited opportunity she had as a woman for financial security.\\"Campbell (1991)\\", p 5 She resigned after six years and joined the Brandon Labor Church where she served from 1920-1928. The Brandon Labor Church was born out of the 1919 strike,\\"Campbell (1991)\\", p 105 but the strike was not the cause of the church forming. Rather, it was the impetuous for completing a formal organization which had been informally functioning for several years.\\"Campbell (1991)\\", p 106 The Labor Church movement began in Europe in the previous century and provided the link between Brigden's belief in social gospel and her need for political action.\\"Campbell (1991)\\", p 101 Though the Labor Church limited the roles she could play and the positions she could attain, as did the Methodist church, the social philosophy of the Labor Church was more in line with her own\\"Campbell (1991)\\", pp 108-109 desire to help the working classes and immigrants.\\"Campbell (1991)\\", p 111 She ran study groups and children's programs for the church and worked with its socialist ministry until the church ceased to exist in 1928.\\"Campbell (1991)\\", p 113 In 1921 Brigden was teaching classes for developmentally challenged children for the local school board, as well as caring for her aging parents and turned down an offer to run on the Dominion Labour Party ticket,\\"Campbell (1991)\\", p 117 but she did agree to become a campaign worker for Robert Forke\\"Campbell (1991)\\", p 118 on the Progressive ticket, which he handily won.\\"Campbell (1991)\\", p 120 In the early 1920s she organized the People's Forum Speaker's Bureau, which included such speakers as John Queen, Anna Louise Strong, Frank Underhill, J.

In 1930, she ran as Brandon's first federal Labour Party candidate on a Farmer-Labour platform.\\"Campbell (1991)\\", p 2\\"Campbell (1991)\\", p 115 but lost to Conservative Candidate David Wilson Beaubier.

In 1936, Brigden ran as ILP-CCF Candidate in the general election. In her interview at the time, she stated that she was working for the Manitoba Human Rights Commission and had been employed by the organization since its founding. She did not win the election, but continued to run in both national and regional elections. In 1947, Brigden attended the Primer Congreso Interamericano de Mujeres held in Guatemala City, Guatemala as the delegate for the Winnipeg Local Council of Women. The conference was called by the called together by the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom to discuss women's issues, pacifism and promote inter-American policies for dealing with armament, human rights, economic security, and many other topics. Between 1954 and 1958, though not an aboriginal nor were any of the board members, Brigden served on the Indian and Métis Committee. She was recognized as an advocate for women's rights and for aboriginal people and pressed for the opening of the Indian-Métis Friendship Centres to address the needs of urban aboriginal people. In 1958, after four years of planning, a resolution was passed to open a referral centre to help native persons relocating to urban areas access the social services available. The first center opened in 1959. She continued to be active on the Board and in attendance at Conferences for the Indian and Métis Committee until 1969. Brigden served in multiple capacities for many different women's groups. She had been a President Winnipeg Council of Women, an organizer of Provincial Council of Women, a member and delegate to international meetings for the University Women's Club, Chairman of the Arts and Letters Committee of the National Council of Women, a member of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, an organizer of the SHARE and Open-Door Club for Canadian Mental Health Association, founder of the Indian-Métis Friendship Centres, organizer of Women's Model Parliaments. CFF became the New Democratic Party in 1961\\"Campbell (1991)\\", p 152 and she remained active until 1975. In 1970, Brigden was honored by the Manitoba Historical Society receiving a Centennial Medal and in 1973, her alma mater, Brandon University awarded her an honorary degree. She also received the Manitoba Golden Boy Award in recognition of her civic efforts. Brandon University awarded her an honorary degree in 1973. She wrote an autobiography entitled One Woman's Campaign for Social Purity and Social Reform. Brigden died 22 February 1977 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada and was buried in the Napinka Cemetery.

It was built from to 1888. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 25 October 2002.  History  Stonehouse is a group of related stone buildings on the D'Aguilar Highway, formerly part of the old coach road between Esk and Nanango, which were built in the 1870s and 1880s as part of a homestead and wayside inn complex. The land on which the complex was built had been part of a pastoral run called \\"Colinton\\", which was taken up by John and Robert Balfour in 1841. The early 1840s were a period of pastoral expansion in the Moreton Bay, Darling Downs and Brisbane Valley Regions following the winding down and closure of the Moreton Bay penal colony (now Brisbane). Although the Darling Downs had been visited in 1827 by explorer Alan Cunningham, who had reported favourably on the suitability of the district for pastoralism, the presence of the fifty-mile exclusion zone around the penal colony and consequent lack of port access had discouraged early settlement. In 1840, the Leslie brothers arrived from the Clarence River district and took up Canning Downs, the first pastoral run on the Darling Downs. In 1841 the runs in the Brisbane Valley were Cressbrook, Colinton and Farney Lawn taken up under licences to occupy Crown Land beyond the limit of settlement. By 1842, when Moreton Bay was thrown open for free settlement, a cluster of huge runs had claimed most of the productive land on the Darling Downs and searches for grazing country were extending north. The area around Stonehouse was declared as pastoral district in May 1842 and the runs of Kilcoy, Taromeo, Taabinga and Burrandowan were taken up in that year. Jane Williams at Stonehouse, Moore The separation of Queensland occurred in 1859 and in the 1868 the Crown Lands Alienation Act was passed to make land available for closer settlement by drastically reducing the size of existing pastoral runs. This brought more settlers into the Brisbane Valley. In 1873 and 1874 around 30 members of the Williams family of Gloucestershire in England arrived in Queensland as immigrants. They settled in Brisbane, Ipswich and the Brisbane Valley. Robert Williams, a widower, had previously lived in Ipswich in the 1860s and in 1874 he selected two blocks of land totalling 2442 acres from the Colinton lease as a grazing property. His brother Charles with his wife Emma joined him. Charles, who was a stonemason, began work on a five-roomed stone house at the selection, which Robert had named Stonehouse after the village in Gloucestershire where he had lived. The new building was close to a two-room slab house that the family presumably lived in during construction. Building in stone was an unusual choice in this area, but a natural one for a family of stonemasons, given the ready availability of the materia on site. Because the house was built of stone, the name later became corrupted to \\"Stone House\\" or \\"Stone Houses\\". In the 1870s, Edward (Ned) MacDonald started a coach and mail service between his hotel at Esk and Goode's Inn at Nanango along the old dray route. Several stops for changes of horses punctuated the trip. Stonehouse was one of these and the Williams built stables on the river flats across the road from the inn. Robert Williams applied for and gained a hotel licence for the property in 1880 as the Stonehouse Hotel, Wallaby Creek, Colinton. The places where major routes crossed watercourses were often used as camps by drovers and carriers and were excellent locations for inns that catered to travellers. These were places where one could obtain food and accommodation for people and horses, where it was usually possible to obtain the services of a blacksmith, leave or collect mail and gain information on the condition of the road ahead. The inns were also a social amenity as a source of company and conviviality on the road. Their services made the development of regular supply routes possible, which in turn made a major contribution to the way in which areas were opened up for European settlement. In 1884 the Stonehouse license was forfeited following an incident where Robert Williams was threatened with an axe following his attempt to intervene in a drink-fuelled argument between members of group of Aborigines camped near the hotel. However, he continued to provide food and accommodation for travellers, and is mentioned in the popular 19th-century ballad Brisbane Ladies as being a stop on the road. In 1882, Emma Williams died and was buried near the creek. This grave was washed away by a flood surge in the 1940s. Robert Williams remarried and a kitchen and pantry were constructed as apprentice work by his nephew Frank Williams. Charles Williams died in 1887 as the result of an accident near \\"Taromeo\\" where he had been carrying out stonework. The last masonry work carried out at Stonehouse was in 1888 when Frank Williams completed the store and butcher's shop. In 1893, Alex MacCallum, who thereafter ran a coach service that used the facilities at Stonehouse, gained the mail contract. It ran until 1910, at first three times a week, then from 1902, twice a week. Times were changing and in 1900 a Royal Commission was appointed to investigate the possible route for a railway in the area, taking evidence at Esk, \\"Cressbrook\\", \\"Colinton\\" and Stonehouse, which were the coach stops. \\"Colinton\\" was cut up and sold around this time, bringing in many new settlers and Stonehouse acted as a provision store and butcher's shop for them. A small township was surveyed at Moore, named for the then owners of \\"Colinton\\", gaining a postal receiving office in 1903 and a post office in 1905. In 1910 a railway station opened at Moore. Robert Williams had died in 1907 and was buried near Moore. A memorial made by Frank Williams, who had established a monumental masonry firm at Ipswich in 1901, marks his grave. Frank was later to construct many war memorials, including the Esk, the Gatton War Memorial, the Warwick War Memorial and the Ipswich War Memorial. Stonehouse was left in trust to a nephew, Thomas (TJC) Williams, who moved to the property with his family in 1908. A sale was then held of cattle, pigs and the post horses. At the time it was found that the buildings needed maintenance and by 1910 repairs and refurbishment had been carried out. By this time iron had already been laid over the original shingles. Between 1914 and 1918 the first house was demolished and the stables collapsed. A tennis court was erected in the vicinity of the stables. In 1923 Jane Williams became ill and the family moved to Brisbane, leasing Stonehouse to Allan Patterson who arranged for Arthur Ollenburg, a Williams family member, to manage the property. TJC Williams died in 1932 and Jane in 1933. The Stonehouse land was subdivided and sold by auction. J J Tilley purchased the land containing Stonehouse and in 1939 it was bought by Barney Grant who continued to employ Arthur Ollenburg as manager. Grant died in 1945 and in 1946 his son took over the management of Stonehouse and built a house for himself and his family. In 1950 a plaque recognising the historical significance of Stonehouse to the area was affixed to the house, but between 1948 and 1960 the buggy shed, workshop, hayshed, poultry run, slaughterhouse and barn were demolished. In 1967 a storm removed the front verandah roof of the main building. A large crack in the wall had developed and a section of the house was then demolished. The Esk Shire Council used stone blocks from this section to construct a picnic shelter at Moore. The house was inspected and drawn by Karl Langer for the National Trust of Queensland in 1969. Since then the buildings have continued to deteriorate and the proportion of the main building still standing has diminished. In January 2001 the property changed hands with the new owners committed to preserving Stonehouse.  Description  Stonehouse, 2002 Stonehouse currently comprises three stone structures on the southern side of the highway between Moore and Nanango. They are on a spur that drops away sharply to the west to a creek and river flat. The ridge rising behind the buildings is thought to have been the source for the stone used in construction. Stonehouse, 2002 Closest to the highway, which was the former coach road, are the remains of the main building. These ruins comprise one single storey wing of rubble laid with a lime mortar. The timber window and doorframes remain, though the windows and door they held have gone. Sections of a pole roof frame also survive. The rest of this building has collapsed and though sections of wall can be discerned, much of the stone has been removed over time. Directly behind to one side of this building is a detached kitchen and pantry. This building is intact. It is rectangular in plan and is also constructed of rubble. It has a verandah roof supported on timber posts along one side over an earth floor. The gabled roof is clad with corrugated iron over a frame of poles and pit-sawn beams although the battens have been renewed. The walls are higher inside than outside and are formed around the roof beams and door lintels. The end wall to the rear contains a chimney that has been repaired with brick at the top. The interior of the structure has been limewashed and has a timber floor. There is a wide fireplace and working bench for cooking at one end with a brick floor around the hearth. At the other end of the building is a room with a lean to roof and a brick floor, which is thought to have been used as a pantry. The store and butcher's shop is of similar construction and is set further back on the site and about away from the kitchen, which was once separated from it by an internal laneway. The store has a gabled roof clad in corrugated iron with battens for shingles underneath. It comprises three rooms: a large room with a timber floor and two small rooms at the end of the building. These are connected with each other, but not with the timber floored section. The room at the rear has stone paving visible under a concrete topping. The wall at this end of the building has been clad in corrugated iron and a section at the front in recycled timber slabs. One metre behind the store is a large modern metal shed in the position once occupied by the smithy and fowl yards. There is no visible trace of the outbuildings once located at the rear of the property. A mid twentieth century timber building on low stumps is located at the front of the property and is the current residence.  Heritage listing  Stonehouse was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 25 October 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Stonehouse is a group of stone buildings surviving from an early wayside inn and as such illustrates the pattern of European settlement in Queensland. Inns serviced early supply routes by providing food and accommodation, fresh horses and a mail exchange and greatly facilitated the spread of European settlement. In particular the Stonehouse complex illustrates the transition of the surrounding area from pastoral settlement in the early 1840s to closer settlement from the 1870s when the first structures at Stonehouse were built. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The inn complex is rare in Queensland both as a surviving example of a travellers' inn and as a group of early stone buildings that utilise material found on site. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The Stonehouse inn, its subsidiary structures and the area around them, which formed part of the inn yards, have the potential to reveal information about the operation of wayside inns in Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Stonehouse is a good example of its kind and preserves examples of early building techniques in both stone and timber. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Stonehouse complex has strong aesthetic appeal as a group of well-made traditional buildings that are pleasing in form, materials and detail. The use of local stone makes them visually harmonious with the landscape and their prominent position above the highway has made them a well-liked landmark. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. 'Stonehouse' has associations with several generations of the Williams family, who emigrated from Gloucestershire to Queensland as an extended family group in the early 1870s. It has particular associations with Charles and Frank William who constructed the building, Frank Williams later becoming a notable monumental mason.

Performing a mix of indie pop and psychedelic pop music, the band sings exclusively in English. In 2014 they released their debut album Hello.  Biography  The band formed in January 2012 in Ayabe, Kyoto when childhood friends Alec, Ric, Syu and Bob decided to create a band. Alec, Ric and Bob had gone to the same elementary school, and met Syu in junior high school. All four of the band members were a part of their school's basketball club, and performed their first live concert on a float for their town Ayabe's Christmas parade, in junior high school. After giving up music for a while because of how busy basketball club was making them, Alex, Bob and Syu reformed as a three-member band, inspired by the music of The Doors. Ric joined the band later, performing keyboards, and the group became more interested in psychedelic music, as well as the music of The Velvet Underground and Pink Floyd's debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967) when they continued to play through their high school years. In their final years of high school, the band members became friends with Koji Shimotsu of the band Odotte Bakari no Kuni, who introduced them to more recent musical acts such as Justice and Gorillaz, heavily influencing the band's sound. Chew joined the band in 2012, when the group officially became Happy. He had known the other members after meeting them at basketball matches between their high schools. When the members were still living in Ayabe, they went to stay at Chew's apartment in Osaka when they performed live concerts in Osaka and Kobe, eventually leading Chew to join the band. In 2013 performed at the Summer Sonic Festival, and in March 2014 performed a tour in the United States with Japan Nite, an event organized by South by Southwest. The band released their first single in March 2014 exclusively to Tower Records stores, Sun, featuring the songs \\"Lift this Weight\\" and \\"Win Key Gun\\". This was followed by a double A-side single \\"Wake Up\\" / \\"Lucy\\" in June, also exclusive to Tower Records.

Rockefeller, it is the oldest college and academic unit of Central Philippine University and the first and oldest Baptist theological seminary in the Philippines (first Protestant theological seminary outside Luzon). It was later folded and became as the theological department, a year after when Jaro Industrial School (the second predecessor of Central Philippine University), became a junior college in 1923. In 1938, the Baptist Missionary Training School for women, a separate seminary for women, merged with it when Central Philippine University became a senior college.

Retrieved 07-06-2015 History American industrialist, philanthropist, and devoted Northern Baptist John D. Rockefeller gave a grant in 1901 to the American Baptist Churches to establish mission schools in the Philippine islands. The task to found the missions schools was given to the American missionary William Valentine. Prior when the Philippines was ceded to the United States administration by Spain through the Treaty of Paris (1898), the Americans brought their faith, the Protestantism. A comity agreement with Protestant American churches and sects was created to divide the Philippine islands for missionary works and to avoid future conflicts with different churches.Guillermo & Verora, pp. 1–3 Western Visayas came to the jurisdictions of the Baptists (Northern Baptist). An idea of establishing an industrial for boys and theological seminary to train Christian workers and ministers thereafter was conceived. Then in 1901, a grant was given by the American industrialist, philanthropist, oil magnate, and devoted Northern Baptist John D. Rockefeller to establish mission schools in the islands to the American Baptist Churches. The Philippine Baptist Conference voted later in December 1904 to establish two schools, an industrial school for boys and a Bible school to train ministers and other Christian workers. The task to found the mission schools was given to American missionary William Orison Valentine, who also became the first presidents of the both schools, with other missionaries as co-founders.Roque Granada, William O. Valentine, in Half a Century of Service, Souvenir Journal of the Golden Jubilee Year (Central Philippine University, Iloilo, 1959), p. 48. Before it, Valentine and Miss Van Allen were married back in 1903 and thereafter, the couple left for the new appointment in Iloilo in the Philippines. In the summer of 1905 (June), the Baptist Missionary Training School was established by the Reverend William Orison Valentine in their home and later in the fall of 1905, the Jaro Industrial School was established. The leadership of the Bible School was turned over to the Reverend Henry Munger who conducted classes off campus. In 1907, Dr. Eric Lund became principal and classes were held at the Mission Press building where Lund was doing his Scripture translation work. When Dr. Lund left in 1912, the Bible School was closed. It was reopened in 1913 by Reverend Alton Bigelow. It was under his leadership that the school began to have a definite direction in its development. The Reverend William Orison Valentine, the founder of Central and first president. In 1923, the Jaro Industrial School became Central Philippine College. In April of the following year, the Baptist Missionary Training School became an organic part of the College. A program leading to the degree of Bachelor of Theology was offered. Those who enrolled were men students who were trained to be pastors of the churches. In 1936, through the guidance of Rev. Alton Bigelow, the school became the Department of Theology of Central Philippine College. While the Baptist Missionary Training School was established for the training of men to be pastors, the training of women to be missionaries began in 1907 with the establishment of separate seminary for women under the leadership of Miss Anna V. Johnson and Celia Sainz. Both were sent to the Philippines by the Women’s American Baptist Foreign Mission Society. Miss Johnson was assigned in Capiz. The seminary for women continued to develop separately from the Baptist Missionary Training School until 1938, when it was merged with the Department of Theology of Central Philippine College. With the merging of the two schools, two degree programs were offered-the Bachelor of Theology and the Bachelor of Science in Religious Education. On April 1, 1953, Central Philippine College was granted government recognition as a university. Following this, the Department of Theology became the College of Theology. Gradually, the leadership of the university and the College of Theology was turned over to the Filipinos. A significant part of this Filipinization process took place in 1966 when Dr. Rex D. Drilon became the first Filipino President of the University. At present, the college is affiliated with the Convention of Philippine Baptist Churches and a member of Association of Theological Education in South East Asia and the South East Asia Graduate School of Theology.

It is the deadliest eruption in New Zealand since the arrival of Europeans. Around 120 people were killed, and many settlements were destroyed or buried. Eruption Shortly after midnight on the morning of 10 June 1886, a series of more than 30 increasingly strong earthquakes were felt in the Rotorua area and an unusual sheet lightning display was observed from the direction of Tarawera. At around 2:00 am, a larger earthquake was felt and followed by the sound of an explosion. By 2:30 am Mount Tarawera's three peaks had erupted, blasting three distinct columns of smoke and ash thousands of metres into the sky At around 3.30 am, the largest phase of the eruption commenced; vents at Rotomahana produced a pyroclastic surge that destroyed several villages within a radius, and the Pink and White Terraces appeared to be obliterated. Approximately of tephra was erupted, more than Mount St. Helens ejected in 1980. Many of the lakes surrounding the mountain had their shapes and areas dramatically altered, especially the eventual enlargement of Lake Rotomahana, the largest crater involved in the eruption, as it re-filled with water. The rift created during the eruption extends across the mountain, Lake Rotomahana and through the Waimangu Volcanic Rift Valley. The eruption was heard clearly as far away as Blenheim and the effects of the ash in the air were observed as far south as Christchurch, over away. In Auckland the sound of the eruption and the flashing sky was thought by some to be an attack by Russian warships. Effects The eruption split the mountain and created the Waimangu Volcanic Rift Valley, which lies at the south-western end of the rift created on 10 June 1886. The famed Pink and White Terraces, natural wonders of New Zealand, were until 2017 thought destroyed. Recent research using a forgotten 1859 survey has suggested possible locations of the Pink and White Terraces. A small portion of the Pink Terraces was reportedly rediscovered under Lake Rotomahana 125 years later. In 2017, using a lost 1859 survey of the old lake and terraces, researchers finally georeferenced the old Lake Rotomahana and the original Pink and White Terrace locations. Mount Tarawera was made up of three peaks which erupted one after the other. The first one to erupt was the Wahanga peak (located to the north), the next was Ruawahia (situated in the middle), and the last one was Tarawera (the southern peak). The Tikitapu bush was completely covered under the ash and the surrounding forests were flattened by the blasts. The land was covered with millions of tonnes of volcanic ash, mud and debris on average thick. Although the official contemporary death toll was 153, exhaustive research by physicist Ron Keam only identified 108 people killed by the eruption. Much of the discrepancy was due to misspelled names and other duplications. Allowing for some unnamed and unknown victims, he estimated that the true death toll was 120 at most.Aftermath – Death list , Anheizen.com. Accessed 20 March 2009. Some people claim that many more people died.In 2007, the General Manager of the Earthquake Commission said that \\"... Ngati Hinemihi oral accounts put the death toll in the thousands.\\" David Middleton (2007). A Roof Over Their Heads? The challenge of accommodation following disasters . Accessed 12 April 2008. The Māori settlements of Moura, Te Koutu, Kokotaia, Piripai, Pukekiore, Otuapane, Te Tapahoro, Te Wairoa, Totarariki, and Waingongoro were buried or destroyed. The official death toll was reported as 150, and many more were displaced, making the eruption the most deadly in New Zealand history. Some of the local survivors at Te Wairoa took shelter in a Māori meeting house, a wharenui, named Hinemihi, which was later taken to England and erected in the grounds of Clandon Park, the seat of the 4th Earl Onslow, who had been governor-general of New Zealand at the time.

History After its establishment in 1874, the Diocese of San Antonio needed to find a system for training clergy to care for its people, sending them on a temporary basis to various institutions in the region over the next quarter- century. With no seminary in the diocese, in 1902 these seminarian were sent to the newly opened San Antonio Philosophical and Theological Seminary (now the Oblate School of Theology). In 1915, faced with a severe shortage of priests and a booming Catholic population due to refugees from the Mexican Revolution, John W. Shaw, the Bishop of San Antonio, decided to open a seminary in his own residence, teaching university level studies. As early as 1911, he had declared that: “I have laid down a rule that for the future no student will be ordained until such time as he can speak Spanish fluently.” Five years later, the school was given the name of St. John’s Seminary and was relocated to a site adjacent to Immaculate Conception Mission in the same city. In 1928, two years after the diocese was elevated to the status of an archdiocese, a theology department was added. By that time, priests of the archdiocese formed the core of the faculty of the seminary. Around 1940, the then-Archbishop of Oklahoma City, Robert E. Lucey, placed the Congregation of the Mission (better known as the Vincentian Fathers) in charge of the seminary. During World War II, he purchased the former Presbyterian-affiliated Trinity University facility on Woodlawn Avenue. At the dedication ceremony for the new location in 1952, the school was given the new name of Assumption Seminary. In 1967 archdiocesan clergy once again assumed responsibility for the administration of the school. The Mission Road facility was closed, and theology students began taking academic courses at the Oblate School of Theology in 1969. To prepare students for ministry to the Hispanic population of the country, the Mexican American Cultural Center was opened on the Woodlawn Avenue campus in 1972. Current status Today alumni from Arizona, California, Colorado, Louisiana, Virginia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina and Texas, as well as El Salvador, serve the Catholic populations of their dioceses. Twelve Catholic bishops have been among the alumni of the school.

It is Number 73 in his catalogue of works and one of four independent compositions related to his opera, Mittwoch aus Licht. A performance lasts about 16 minutes. History Trumpetent was written in October 1995 for Markus Stockhausen, Achim Gorsch, Andreas Adam, and Marco Blaauw, who gave the first performance on 31 May 1996 at the Philharmonic Hall in Cologne. The score is dedicated to these four performers, and to \\"all trumpeters who play in the spirit of Michael\\" . Analysis Philharmonic Hall in Cologne, the space in which Trumpetent was premiered The work is based on the superformula for Mittwoch aus Licht, which is played at the end of Trumpetent in its simplest form from inside the tent, starting in bar 34 . It is one of several independent works built in various ways from the Mittwoch superformula. The others are Europa-Gruss, Klavierstück XVIII, and Mittwoch Formel for percussion trio . A white, pyramidal tent is set up on the stage at the front of the auditorium with two sides facing the audience. There are four round holes—two in each of the visible sides—a little larger than the bell of a trumpet cut in the walls of the tent. The composition falls into four sections, defined in part through the movement of the performers through and around the audience : *Space I: The trumpets enter the hall calmly from the four cardinal directions and walk to the centre of the hall while playing sustained notes. They play a synchronous passage, and then continue back out of the hall to the opposite corners, still playing. *Space II. The players re-enter from the four corners, this time striding anti-clockwise while playing a series of long trills with swelling dynamics, finally leaving the hall a second time at the four corners, playing all the while. *Space III. The trumpeters re-enter, this time all from the rear, and march two-by-two down the aisle to the tent, circling behind and entering the tent, sticking the bells of the trumpets out of the four holes. *In the Tent. The quartet play the formula synchronously one last time, slowly withdrawing the bells back into the tent. The pitch structure consists of the three strands of the Wednesday formula (Lucifer formula beginning on A, Eve formula beginning on D, Michael formula beginning and ending on E), rotating among the four trumpets together with a fourth strand compositionally embellished from various parts of the formulas. Durations are serially disposed in sets of 7 + 5 + 6 minims (14 + 10 + 12 crotchets) . Discography * Michaels-Ruf, Bassetsu for basset horn, Synthi-Fou, Quitt, Komet for a percussionist, Trumpetent.

First elected in the 1961 election, he was forced to resign the seat within a few months after a firm in which he was part owner won a contract from the council, placing Chamberlist in a conflict of interest. Herbert Boyd, the only candidate to file nomination papers when a by-election was called, was acclaimed to the seat in early 1962. Chamberlist stood for office again in the 1967 election, and won election that year. In his speech on election night, he called on the Parliament of Canada to extend greater power to the territorial council. In 1968, he was an outspoken opponent of the city of Whitehorse installing parking meters, even hiring a lawyer to represent all citizens of the city in challenging their parking tickets. Shortly before the 1970 election, Chamberlist opposed a federal government report on the Yukon, on the grounds that Canada had been granted administratorship rights over the territory but actual legal ownership still rested with the British Empire.

His grave is located in Kazmain, Iraq. He is popularly known by his laqab (nickname) Razi. He wrote several books on Islamic issues and interpretation of the Quran. His best-known book is Nahj al-Balaghah, whose manuscript copy dating from 1158 AD is preserved in the Raza Library established by Nawab Faizullah Khan of Rampur, India in 1774 AD.  Family background  Razi was the third of four children, having two sisters and a brother. Khadija and Zaynab were his two sisters. His younger sister died in his lifetime, and he lamented her death in a mournful elegy expressing deep sorrow. His father, Abu Ahmed Husayn bin Musa, held fifth position in line of descendant from the 7th Imam Musa al-Kazim Sayyid Razi's mother Fatimah also traced her lineage to Muhammad and was the daughter of Husayn bin Abu Muhammad al-Hasan al-Utrush bin Ali bin Hasan bin Umar al- Ashraf the son of the 4th Shia Imam, Ali ibn al-Husayn Zayn al-Abidin. His father, Abu Ahmad, for a long time occupied the post of Naqib of the Talibiyyin, a position that empowered him to look after the affairs of Muhammad's descendants ( Sadat). His father was first appointed as Naqueeb and later as \\"Naqib al-Nuqaba\\" an official responsibility as a chief which required the managing of affairs of Sadat. After death of father, the portfolio \\"Naqib al-Nuqaba\\" of Iraq, was transferred to Sharif Razi who had already been assisting his father in his official duties. His family was well- to-do on both the paternal and maternal side. His mother Fatima inherited a good fortune from her father. She sponsored the family when the property of her husband was confiscated by the Buyid prince Adud al-Dawla. She used to help people who suffered hardships and patronized her relatives. Her interest in theology was respected by theologian Shaikh Mufid. His elder brother Sayyid Murtadhā, popularly known by his nickname Alum-ul-Hudda was also a theologian and poet. His work is still published in the universities of Cairo and Beirut and form part of the course of Arabic literature.

He started teaching at the young age of 17 when he was himself studying. He completed his education at the age of twenty with different teachers. Most of his teachers were scholars and writers of Arabic. Due to the climate of tolerance prevailing in that era, Shia and Sunni students used to attend classes of teachers belonging to different sects, that is why many of the teachers of Sharif Razi were Sunni and Mu'tazili e.g. (i) Abu 'Ali al-Hasan ibn Ahmad al-Farsi (307-77/919-87) belonged Mutazili school (ii) Abu Ishaq Ibrahim ibn Ahmad al-Tabari (d. 393/1002-3), follower of Maliki school). In addition to his Master al-Mufid, he also studied Arabic language and grammar under Abu Sa'id al-Hasan ibn 'Abd Allah ibn Marzban al-Sirafi (284-368/897-979), an expert in Arabic language and literature. His teacher in fiqh, was Muhammad ibn al-Abbas al-Khwarizmi (d. 383/993). PDF version He also founded a school named Dar ul'Ilm (, literally House of knowledge) in which he trained many students, some of them later became scholars themselves. Character and literary status Syed Razi was a significant figure in his time. He occupied responsible positions both secular as well as religious. Since his childhood he was a student of learning, acquiring Islamic Sciences of his time and applied his life span as a man of principle and collector of wisdom from literature. In his lifetime Abbasid rulers of Baghdad were at war with Fatimid Caliphs of Egypt and attempted to have all Sunni and Shia important figures to sign a Mahzur (public attestation decree) in favour of the legitimacy of war with the Egyptian rulers. Sharif Razi, his father and brother were also asked forcefully to sign it. But Sayyid Razi refused to sign this Mahzur at the cost of losing political privilege and official status of his family, even many a times he refused to accept financial support from the ruling kings in order to save himself from undue government influence. He devoted twenty years of his life in compiling Nahj al-Balaghah, and travelled to many libraries to collect texts that had recorded the lectures, letters, and sayings that Ali had written or delivered on different occasions. However, Nahj al-Balaghah does not contain all of Ali’s speeches, it is the most complete of any book to date. His life reflects the quote he has compiled in his compilation (Nahj al- Balagha) that Muslims are our brothers in faith; those who are non-Muslims are our brethren in creation. He was a scholar, a poet and a man of cultivated taste. Al-Tha’alibi, his contemporary regarded Syed Razi as the most remarkable man among scholars of his time and the noblest amongst the Sayyids of Iraq. He was the most remarkable poet among the descendants of Ali Ibn Abi Talib, though there were many distinguished poets during Golden age of Abbasid and Fatimid caliphs.  Works  Sayyid Razi was an Arabic poet and writer. Besides Peak of Eloquence and his poetry, nearly 40 books are credited to him, including Talkhis al-Bayan an Majazat al-Quran, Al-Majazatul nabaweyyah, Haqa'iq al-Ta'wil fi Mutashabih al-Tanzil, Ma'ani al-Quran and Khasais of Al Aemmah The Nahj al-Balagha (Peak of Eloquence) is considered a masterpiece of literature in Shia Islam. The Book is a collection of sermons, precepts, prayers, epistles and aphorisms of Imam Ali compiled by Sayyid Radi in the tenth century. The Nahj al-Balagh literary means peak or way of eloquence, it comprises a wide variety of topics ranging from the creation of the Universe, the creation of first man and end of universe. Syed Razi had inserted every sentence in the same form as he found it, so that the writing should not suffer any meddling. He refrained from applying his own approach of writing or expression. In his compilation work he only did classification of collected materials into sermons, letters and sayings of Imam Ali. As the reference material came to his attention at different times, the extracted materials had no chronological sequence according to content or topic. He died just after five years of his compiled book Nahjul Balagha, his compilation promptly gained the popularity even in his lifetime. A number of his contemporaries started writing commentaries on the compilation of Sayyid Razi, this work of commenting on the text and interpretation of meaning of the words used by Ali Ibn Abi Talib and the historical events mentioned therein is continued till today. A Lebanese Christian scholar, George Jordac, reveals that he has repeatedly studied the Peak of Eloquence up to 200 times. Extent and scope of compilation The sermons of Imam Ali were compiled, read and taught long before Sayyid Razi was born. The compilation of Nahj al-Balagha was a holy job for Sharif Razi and he accomplished the duty with dedication and carefulness. During his collection he had been so cautious and left no lacuna refraining himself from adding or subtracting a singular word beyond the text he obtained from the scattered Islamic literature. Even the sermons he received in divided portions were placed in compilation without joining the pieces into a continuous part. This incoherent scripture was criticized by a number of critics. The services of Sharif Razi are now regarded as significant in the philosophy of monotheism. More than 30 writers with name of their books/compilations are generally discussed while compilation work of Nahj al- Balagha is scrutinized e.g. :(i) Ibn Nadeem and his book Kitabul Jumal :(ii) Ibn Qutayba Daynawari and his book Uyunul Akhbbar :(iii) Imam Hakim and his book al-Mustadarak :(iv) Shaikh Mufid and his book al-Irshad; etc Collected sermons in the Nahj al-balagha mainly reflects the coverage of topics (i) Islam and the Quran (ii) Human and humanity (iii) Theology and metaphysics (iv) Path and worship, including prayers (v) Social justice and administration (vi) Wisdom and admonition (vii) Prophecies (viii) Philosophy and critique over contemporary society (ix) Ahl-ul-Bait (x) piety and afterworld. Many research scholars in the modern age have presented their theses and published in the journals of different countries. retrieved: 11 July 2015 retrieved: 11 July 2015 The book compiled by Sharif Razi has also been quoted by the UN Secretary General as a role model of governance in the year 2002 during a meeting of the Arab Development Fund. However, critics of Nahj al-Balagha generally raise two objections over compilation of Sharif Razi : :*Firstly they claim that Sayyid Murtaza (the elder brother of Sharif Razi) is its author; and :* secondly they allege that most of the contents of this book are forged and falsely attributed to Imam Ali ::Ibn Khallikan seems to have been the first to raise doubts on its authenticity. The majority of later writers, beginning with Dhahabi in Mizan al-Itidal, Ibn Hajar in Lisan al-Mizan, Haji Khalifa in Kashf al-Zunun, etc. have in their turn revived these suspicions. Various commentators and researchers have examined the authenticity of objections and concluded that had al-Sharif al-Radi not collected that which he selected from among the sermons and words of the Imam Ali in Nahj al- Balaghah, we would have been definitely deprived thereof as well. The Urdu translator of Nahjul Balagha Syed Zeeshan Haider Jawadi has compiled a list of 61 books and name of their writers from 204 to 488 AH, in negation of the above-mentioned two objections and pointed the sources in which compilation work of Sharif Razi can be traced out.  Offspring and death  A number of writers traced the death of Razi at 47 years on 6th of Mohurram 406 A.H (1015 AD), whereas some historians recorded his age as 45 years and death in 404 Hijri (1013 AD). His funeral prayer was performed by the Abu Ghalib Fukhrul Mulk then Prime Minister in the kingdom of Sultan al-Dawla. Abu Ahmed Adnan was the only son of Sayyid Razi. His son was also a prominent scholar of his time and after death of his uncle the official post of Naqib al-Nuqqab was entrawarded to his grandfather. Adnan died issueless in 449 Hijri Calendar, and consequently the physical line of Sayyid Razi came to an end.

Career  Jakeway spent seventeen years with the Colonial Administrative Service in Nigeria (1937 - 1954); during this time, he was seconded to the Seychelles from 1946 to 1949, and the Colonial Office from 1949 to 1951. He served in Sarawak from 1959 to 1963. He became Governor of Fiji in 1964, serving until 1968. It was during his tenure that a measure of self-government was introduced to Fiji in 1964, followed by responsible government 1967, in preparation for the granting of independence in 1970. The first part of this two-stage process involved appointing members of the Legislative Council to oversee government departments. Only 18 of the 37 Legislative Council members were popularly elected; these eighteen were equally divided between the three principal ethnic groups - Fijians, Indo-Fijians, and Europeans. The six elected members of each ethnic group were allowed to nominate two of their own members to serve on the Executive Council. This \\"Member system\\", as it was known, did not introduce a Cabinet in the modern sense: Members so appointed were responsible only to the Governor, not to the Legislative Council. But it was a crucial stepping stone to the second stage: following elections in 1966 - to a reconstituted Legislative Council that was, for the first time, wholly elected (except for two members nominated by the Great Council of Chiefs) - responsible government was introduced, with a Chief Minister and a Cabinet responsible to the Legislative Council. Jakeway appointed Ratu Kamisese Mara, leader of the Alliance Party, which had handily won the election, as Chief Minister. Jakeway was succeeded as Governor by Sir Robert Sidney Foster in 1968 and retired to Exmouth, Devon, where he became Chairman of the British Health Authority, from which he retired in 1977.  Personal life  Jakeway married Phyllis Watson in 1941. Together they had three sons.http://www.ancientfaces.com/person/simon-b-jakeway/52372400  Honours  Jakeway was awarded the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1948 and was created a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1956. In 1963, he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG).

Their cook stoves are used in large institutional settings such as refugee camps and schools, and empower those who cook with them through implementation of safe and efficient cook stove technology to minimize personal and environmental health risks. InStove's mission is to relieve suffering, improve health, and reduce harm to the environment through the placement of highly efficient biomass cook stoves in vulnerable communities worldwide. InStove's founders are Fred Colgan and Damon Ogle. The nonprofit is based in Cottage Grove, Oregon. History To address the demand for a better way to cook food for millions in refugee camps, engineer Damon Ogle and carpenter Fred Colgan, working with Aprovecho Research Center, developed a highly efficient solid-fuel cookstove for use in institutional settings in 2008. Worldwide, over 43 million displaced people depend upon organizations administering aid in refugee camps. Ogle and Colgan's prototype for InStove's 60 liter capacity cookstove was a rocket stove, powered by internal combustion and 87% more efficient than traditional three stone fires. In July 2012, Colgan founded Institutional Stove Solutions (InStove) as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. InStove developed the 60 Liter Stove, and in 2013 the 100 Liter Stove, to address climate change, emissions, and deforestation issues. InStove is a partner of the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves. As of July, 2015, InStove’s institutional cookstoves have the highest published test scores in the world against the International Standards Organization’s International Workshop Agreement on clean cookstoves. In order to meet the demands of clinics, hospitals, and refugee camps who also need access to safe water and sterile medical equipment, InStove developed allied technologies including a medical equipment sterilization system, water pasteurizer, and a biomass briquette press. Impact and global health concerns Three billion people cook on biomass each day, releasing carbon and particulate matter into the air. Three-stone cooking fires emit more than 100 times the World Health Organization's recommended limit of pollutants such as particulate matter and carbon monoxide. An estimated seven million people die prematurely each year from air pollution, which is preventable with the InStove's rocket design and ventilated chimney. The increased efficiency of InStove's institutional stoves means that women do not have to venture as far to gather firewood for cooking, greatly reducing their exposure to gender and sexual based violence such as assault and rape. 60 and 100 liter stoves InStove’s 60 and 100 Liter cook stoves have been verified by third-party testing center, Aprovecho Research Center, to be tier four—the highest—in 9 out of 11 indicators set by the International Standards Organization's International Workshop Agreement on clean cookstoves. InStove's institutional stoves are manufactured in the United States. At the heart of the stoves is an advanced, insulated metal combustion chamber built from high-temperature 310 stainless steel and 601 nickel alloys. The \\"rocket stove\\" design concentrates heat and mixes combustion gasses to create operating temperatures in excess of 1100 degrees Celsius, which allows the stoves to literally \\"burn up the smoke.\\" This produces a fire that is cleaner and more efficient than is possible otherwise. The sunk-in pot with heat-retaining skirt design allows food to cook more quickly, reducing cooking time by 20-50%. Each stove placed can offset the carbon footprint of 2.7 American households each year and can save up to 88 tons of firewood annually. The 60 Liter InStove uses 2 kilograms of fuel every two hours at peak temperature and boils 30 liters of water in 30 minutes; the 100 Liter InStove boils 50 liters of water in 30 minutes. Stove placements As of June 2014, InStove has distributed over 1,000 stoves in 27 countries around the world. These include Sudan, Ethiopia, South Sudan and Kenya in conjunction with the United Nations, as well as Nigeria., Senegal, and 10 other sub-Saharan countries. A 60 Liter stove was also placed as a part of Opportunity Village, a transitional housing community in Eugene, Oregon as an effort to feed residents and reduce expensive propane costs. In 2014, InStove opened \\"InStove Manufacturing Limited\\" as a benefit corporation to sell stoves to domestic clients such as El Sancho, a Mexican Restaurant in Bend, Oregon which uses a 100-liter stove to sustainably cook large amounts of food. Allied technologies InStove has paired their 60 Liter InStove with a medical grade autoclave manufactured by the Wisconsin Aluminum Foundry (WAFCO). The unit is designed to serve as either a backup for urban health centers or as a primary system for rural clinics without access to electricity, providing sanitation of medical instruments as well as waste to reduce vectors of disease. InStove has also created a solution to lack of safe drinking water. The water pasteurizer system heats water to 71 °C to eliminate 99.99% of pathogens to ensure safe drinking water. The pasteurizer is powered by the 100 Liter Stove, and can pasteurize 800 liters of water an hour using about 5 grams of wood per liter. The unit was tested in Ndola, Zambia in October 2013. InStoves are available for commercial purchase as well as humanitarian aid usage.

Brought up by his father, Cheah Boon Hean, who was in the trading business, he grew up to become a businessman and miner. He was introduced to the tin mining industries of the time by his uncle Foo Choo Choon, the 'Tin King',Ho Tak Ming, When Tin was King. Ipoh: Ho Tak Ming, 2000. who hired him as his attorney. Later, Cheah Cheang Lim was appointed to manage his affairs. Eventually, he started his own company. He also invested in rubber estates but his main interest remained in the tin business. Cheah was also known as a social reformer whose concerns were spread across various issues. He was involved in the anti-opium movement and campaigned for Chinese status in the Malay States, including such efforts as debating against the Banishment Enactment to non-Malays born in the States. He furthermore dedicated his life to promoting and improving Malayan education by instituting several scholarship schemes, including the Queen's Scholarships in British MalayaWu Lien-Teh & Ng Yok-Hing, The Queen's Scholarships of Malaya, 1885–1948.

Volunteering in the Malayan Volunteer InfantryThe Straits Times, 7 August 1916, Page 8. Malayan Volunteer Infantry was a significant part of his later career, as he led the younger generation in a volunteer programme. He was active in several clubs and societies across Malaysia, but mainly in Perak and Penang, where he resided. He was lastly elected as a Federal Counsellor, as a representative of the Chinese population. Early life Cheah Cheang Lim was born to a Penang Hokkien family in Taiping and started out as a postal assistant on the Perak frontier. Growing up, he spent his early years in Taiping. His father was Cheah Boon Hean, son of Cheah Teah and a businessman and trader. His mother was Foo Kang Nyong. At that time, British administrative branches occupied the area, together with the Perak Sikhs, the police force. The Residential System was in practice. Later, a great fire destroyed the Cheah house. The family was invited to stay at Dr. Legge's residence until Cheah Boon Hean made new arrangements. Education After attending a few temporary schools in Taiping, Cheah studied at the Central Government School, managed by Mr. J.L. Greene, now known as the King Edward VII School, up to Standard VI. In 1889, he finished school and applied for a job at the Land Office in Taiping. He was rejected due to his age. He went back to school, became a pupil teacher and studied privately for one year. Career In 1890, he became a probationer at the Posts and Telegraphs Department. Later, he went to replace a brother officer in Port Weld and subsequently, to his friend Joo Sip San at Lahat, Perak. Cheah was a Malay scholar and helped with English correspondence, while he also taught the staff at the Posts and Telegraphs Department to read and write in the Malay language. In 1894, Cheah took over R. Bulner as the postmaster in Tanjung Malim. He was later transferred back to Lahat, where he resigned, as a government office no longer satisfied his ambitions. He had planned to travel to China but was offered a job as the private secretary of Foo Choo Choon, his cousin, proprietor of the globally known Tronoh Mines.Arnold Wright & H.A. Cartwright, Twentieth Century Impressions of British Malaya: Its History, People, Commerce, Industries, and Resources. Indiana: Repressed Publishing LLC, 2013. In 1900, he became the general manager. He worked under Foo Choo Choon for 14 years, until he decided to start his own mining business. His first mine was at Azar Dungsang. In 1923, he was appointed a justice of peace for the State of Perak. In 1927, he was elected as a member of the Federal Council to represent the Chinese community. He served for two terms, from 1927 to 1930 and from 1930 to 1933. The Anti- Opium Movement Cheah was an active supporter of the anti-opium movement. He was one of the founders of the Perak Anti-Opium Society, which was created in December 1906, and was elected as the treasurer. A similar organization was founded in Penang, presided by Dr.Wu Lien-teh. The first Anti-Opium Conference of the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States was held in Ipoh in 1907. It attracted around 3,000 people. The second conference was renewed in 1908 with Mr. Foo Choo Choon as the chairman. It was held in Penang, as, at that time, Penang was a significant landmark in the manufacturing and export of opium to Perak and Southern Siam. In addition, mass meetings were conducted during those years. By the time the International Opium Convention Treaty was registered with the League of Nations in 1922, Cheah became the President of the Anti-Opium Society. Consequently, in October 1923, a joint Federated Malay States petition for the abolition of the opium trade was strengthened by 2,000 signatures. The ban on opium was finally applied 20 years after the beginning of the campaign. Cheah had dedicated 30 years of his life to the cause.

Cheah Kongsi Cheah belonged to the third generation of the Cheah family trustees of Cheah Kongsi (谢公司) in Penang, his grandfather and father before him. He was also appointed honorary secretary. In 1918, he revised the rules and regulations of the organization to adjust to those times. The new constitution was published in 1921. Moreover, he undertook research on the Cheah history and lineage in China, the Cheah Kongsi history and the family cemetery, and came up with a pictorial compilation.Tan Kim Hong, The Chinese in Penang: A Pictorial History. Penang: Areca Books, 2007. In 1927, he was exempted from the obligation of attending the monthly meetings, due to his increasing commitment to the Federated Malay States. From 1931 to 1933, after the President, Cheah Choo Yew, died, Cheah Cheang Lim contributed to the renovation of the Cheah Kongsi. In 1934, he resigned his trusteeship, after 17 years of service, from 1917 to 1934. Volunteering In 1924, Cheah was requested by Colonel Parr to instill the volunteering spirit of the Straits Chinese youth. He thus volunteered as a second lieutenant and appointed Officer Commanding (OC), Chinese Platoon 1, in the Malayan Volunteer Infantry in Perak. In 1930, he was promoted to lieutenant. Family Life In 1896, Cheah married Khoo Pek Hua, a Penang-born Straits Chinese woman. She died on 6 March 1930, due to illness and the grief of losing of three daughters within five years. She was buried at the Cheah family cemetery at Pulau Tikus, Penang. She left Cheang Lim with one son and one daughter, named Cheah Ghim Leng and Cheah Liew Pin, respectively. Ghim Leng was previously a sergeant in the Chinese Company of the Penang and Province Wellesley Volunteer Force, before taking over his father's business in Ipoh. Later, he was appointed Officer Commanding Chinese Platoon I, Malayan Volunteer Infantry, in Perak. In 1935, he was elected a justice of the peace. In the beginning of the year 1941, he was awarded the Order of the British Empire and became a member of the Perak State Council. Cheah remarried in July 1930. His second wife was an English-educated lady named Khoo Chin Choo. The couple adopted a girl named Cheah Liew Khin. Later Years After serving in the Federal Council, he retired from public life. He nevertheless hosted the occasional 'At Home', attended by honorable guests. Upon reaching 60 years of age, he hired Francis Cooray, author and journalist of The Malay Mail to write his biography. In 1946, he also helped in leading the formation of the second/third Penang Clerical UnionThe Straits Times, 12 July 1937, Page 13. Penang Clerks' Union To Protect Interests. Cheah died on 16 November 1948, aged 77, in his home, at Leith Street, Penang. He was buried at Pulau Tikus, Penang. Lorong Cheah Cheang Lim in Ipoh, Perak is named after him.

They have numerous teams competing in competitions run by the Central Coast Division of Country Rugby League, from U/6s through to First Grade. The Sharks' current home grounds are Duffys Road Oval (Seniors) and Brendan Franklin Oval (Juniors). Their traditional colours are sky blue, black and white. History The then village of Terrigal entered teams in local rugby league competitions in 1921 and 1922, and in Second Grade only, in 1931 and 1932. The current club was established in 1975, when Terrigal-Wamberal fielded teams in six of eight 'Schoolboys' competitions: Under 8s, 9s, 10s, 12s, 13s and 14s. The senior division of the club began in 1976, with teams in First Grade, Reserve Grade and Under 18s. Good seasons by the Under 16 team in 1978 and Third Grade in 1979, both making the Final, was followed in 1980 by Terrigal- Wamberal reaching the final of the Southern Division Knock-Out Competition, and finishing equal second in First Grade. In late June, Terrigal defeated Campbelltown City (8-5) and Warilla (23-5) to qualify for the knock-out final, but lost to hosts, Woy Woy, 10-2. In August, having been allotted third place on for and against, Terrigal faced Gosford in a minor semi-final. After an exchange of penalty goals, the Sharks scored in the corner late in the first stanza, to lead 5-4 at half-time. The lead was extended with a penalty, but the Townies capitalised on a line-break with ten minutes to go, to score the winning try. Terrigal's youth teams, Under 19 and Under 17, made the finals in 1982 ahead a strong performance by the club in 1983. All four teams played semi-finals and Third Grade reached the club's first senior Grand Final. The three grades repeated this effort in 1984, Thirds again finishing runners-up. First Grade missed the finals in 1985, but Terrigal's Reserve Grade, Third Grade and Under 18 teams each finished in a top two position. After drawing their major semi-final match twice (19-all and 8-all), the Sharks' Reserve Grade lost a second replay, 26-18. Terrigal defeated Umina 16-8 on the Tuesday night to reach the Grand Final. In their fifth match in fifteen days, a penalty goal gave Terrigal in early lead, but Gosford capitalised on a \\"feast of possession\\" to cross the line for a 6-2 half time lead. A converted try and penalty by the Townies extended the gap. A late Sharks' try saw the score 14-6 at full time. Terrigal's Under 18 team took a more direct route to the 1985 Grand Final, winning their major semi-final against Woy Woy 16-0. Having progressed from fourth place, Wyong began the Grand Final well and took a 12-nil lead in the opening 15 minutes. Despite a strong response from Terrigal through the remainder of the match, Wyong held on to win, 12-10. Third Grade had succumbed to Wyong (38-4) and eventual premiers Woy Woy. The club's growing strength was realised in 1986 when First Grade, Third Grade and Under 18s qualified for the finals. Terrigal's First and Third Grade teams both trailed in their minor semi-final prior to over-running their opponents in the second-half. One week later, the Under 18s won their major semi-final over minor premiers Wyong. Third Grade faltered in their Final, but First Grade won through, again over-turning a half-time deficit (2-8) to win 16-14 and join the Under 18s on Grand Final day. The team named for Terrigal-Wamberal's maiden Grand Final was Alan Denson (1), John Tiwha (2), Mark Powell (3), Bill Bond (4), Andrew Crowther (5), Steve McCoy (6), Colin Wormleaton (7), Trevor Woods (8), Michael Stone (9), Tony Sopp (10), David McPherson (11, Coach), Craig McNee (12) and Keith Cook (13). Terrigal's Under 18 team claimed the club's first premiership when they defeated Wyong in the opening match of Grand Final Day. The Sharks opened the scoring with a penalty goal, then the Roos responded with a converted try. Two Terrigal tries followed, both unconverted, prior to half-time. The second stanza was scoreless, thus Terrigal won by 10 to 6. In First Grade Terrigal, \\"got off to a rousing start when giant winger John Tiwha flashed down the grandstand side of the ground before sending a pass infield. It went to ground but five-eighth Mark Skinner was on the spot to scoop it up and dive over wide out.\\" Woy Woy replied with a try, converted to lead 6-4. The Sharks then used a \\"feast of possession\\" to press the Roosters line for a sustained but unsuccessful period up to half- time. A second Terrigal try was created by the combination of Mark Powell breaking the defensive line and Col Wormleaton regathering his own kick. Woy Woy again responded to reclaim the lead, 12-10. A line-break from Powell and a run from Tiwha took Terrigal within two metres of the try-line. A passing movement with \\"the tired Woy Woy defence in disarray\\" allowed Steve McCoy to score under the posts. Woy Woy persevered, and in the last minute were ruled to have lost the ball inches from the try-line. Final Score: Terrigal 16 Woy Woy 12. Mark Powell was named the Central Coast Express man-of-the-match.

Access is most commonly achieved via the Seldinger technique, and guidance tools such as ultrasound and fluoroscopy can also be used to assist with visualizing access placement.  Methods   Peripheral  The most common form of venous access is a peripheral venous cannula which is generally inserted into veins of the hands, forearms, and occasionally feet. Healthcare providers may use a number of different techniques in order to improve the chances of successful access. Some techniques include using a tourniquet, tapping over the vein, warming the area to dilate the vein, or using an ultrasound to directly visualize the target vein. Near-infrared illumination devices can also be used to help identify superficial veins that are not easily felt or seen with the naked eye. These devices emit infrared light which is absorbed by hemoglobin in the blood, allowing for easier visualization of the vasculature. Peripheral access is usually indicated when short-term access up to 7 days is needed. Complication rates from these peripheral access points increase quickly the longer they remain in place, and thus are routinely removed and replaced every 3–4 days if possible.  Central  In some situations, venous access is obtained by inserting catheters into the large central veins of the body such as the internal jugular, subclavian, or femoral veins. This type of venous access is done with central venous catheters (CVCs), and is required in certain situations where peripheral access is inadequate. Such situations include, but are not limited to, the need for long-term venous access, administering of medications that can damage smaller veins (e.g. chemotherapy), measuring central venous pressure, or obtaining certain blood tests (specifically central venous oxygen saturation). Types of CVCs include non-tunneled and tunneled catheters, PICC lines, and implanted ports.  Midline  Midline access is a type of peripheral venous access inserted into peripheral veins and that extends further than standard peripheral catheters but does not yet reach the large central veins of the thorax. They are used when intermediate-term access is needed or when administering medications that are highly irritating to smaller veins. However, their use is declining in favor of PICC lines which have the added benefit of more central access and longer potential dwell-times.  In children  In children, the most common form of venous access is also peripheral access although the dwell time in children are much shorter than in adults, 1-4 days. Accessing veins in the legs in children can promote immobilization, but is used if there are no other way. In neonates, scalp veins can also be used if other peripheral veins are not accessible. Umbilical veins are also an option in neonates, but is per definition a central access. When accessing veins in children, certain other factors are considered such as their smaller caliber veins and anatomical variations. Gaining venous access in children can thus present a number of different challenges than in adults. For example, certain antiseptic cleaners are avoided because of they may irritate the skin of young children. Children also have thinner connective tissues than adults and thus some techniques used to illuminate veins may have a risk of causing burns.  Complications  Most common complications with venous access are catheter related infections, thrombophlebitis and venous thrombosis. If having thrombophlebitis or thrombosis; pain when using the access is another complication. Peripheral venous access is least prone to thrombosis, followed by midline catheters and the centrally placed catheters. Central venous access is the most common reason for venous thrombosis in children.  Emergency situations  In emergency situations when peripheral access cannot be easily achieved, such as in arrest scenarios, intraosseus methods can be used to gain rapid access to the venous system. These methods usually involve inserting an access device into the tibia or femur bones in the legs, humerus in the upper arm, or sometimes the sternum in the chest. Venous cutdown can also be done to gain immediate emergency access to the venous system. Venous cutdown procedures most commonly target the great saphenous vein in the leg because it is superficial, easily accessible, and consistently in the same anatomical location. This procedure is used in certain populations such as critically ill patients or patients in hypovolemic shock or when less invasive methods such as peripheral catheters or CVCs have failed. However, in many cases the use of intraosseus access has replaced the need for venous cutdown procedures.

The attack has been created for research purposes by Maurizio Aiello and developed by Enrico Cambiaso for the IEIIT Institute of the National Research Council of Italy and released as an Android application. SlowDroid behavior is similar to other Slow DoS Attacks such as Slowloris, since it creates many connections with the victim in order to saturate the resources of the listening daemon application. One difference is on sent payload, which in case of SlowDroid is not compliant to a specific protocol: instead of sending a forged HTTP request, an endless sequence of spaces is sent instead. This characteristic makes SlowDroid able to target different protocols with the same payload. Another difference is on sending: during the data sending phase, instead of sending a sequence of characters as Slowloris does, SlowDroid sends a single character, hence reducing the bandwidth amounts. Finally, the main difference is on implementation: SlowDroid has been implemented to be executed on the Android mobile operating system platform. Slowdroid was initially published on the Google Play Store. Due to developers terms of service, the application has been removed by the store and it is currently available on the researchers website.

Life and career Couderc was born in Toulouse where his father had a grocery shop. He was working in his father's business when Louis Benoît Alphonse Révial (1810-1871) a tenor from Toulouse already studying at the Conservatoire de Paris convinced him to study singing and facilitated his entry to the conservatory in 1830. After studying singing there under Louis Nourrit, Couderc made his debut as Rodolphe in Boieldieu's Le petit chaperon de rouge at the Opéra-Comique in 1834. He created several roles with the company between 1834 and 1841 and was greatly admired for his acting ability. He sang in Belgium from 1842 until 1850 when he returned to the Opéra-Comique where he remained for the rest of his career singing leading tenor and later baritone roles.Duckett, William (ed.) (1853). \\"Couderc, Charles\\", (). Dictionnaire de la conversation et de la lecture, Vol. 6. M. Lévy Frères One of Couderc's last role creations was that of Baladon in Jacques Offenbach's Vert-Vert in March 1869. He was originally to have sung the role of the Prince in the premiere of Offenbach's Fantasio the following year. Rehearsals had begun in early 1870, but were suspended when the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War caused the closure of the Paris theatres.

Biography Blagden was educated at Dulwich College in London, after which he obtained a scholarship to Corpus Christi College, Oxford University where he read Classics, graduating with a first class degree. In 1888 Blagden was appointed to the Straits Settlements civil service in Malaya, where he held a number of administrative and judicial posts in Malacca and Singapore In 1897 he returned to England due to ill health, and the following year he became a Holt Scholar of Gray's Inn in London. In 1897 he was called to the bar, and for the next seventeen years he practiced law, co-authoring a number of legal works, whilst continuing to publish academic articles on Malay, Mon and Pyu. In 1916 the School of Oriental Studies (later School of Oriental and African Studies) was founded as a constituent college of the University of London, in order to promote the teaching of Asian languages and to train colonial officials for the British Empire, admitting its first students in January 1917. Blagden had been acting as an examiner in Malay for the University of London since 1910, and in 1917 he was appointed as Lecturer in Malay at the School of Oriental Studies. He was later promoted to Reader and then Dean, before retiring in 1935. Blagden also cooperated with Evangeline Edwards on studies of Chinese vocabularies of Malacca Malay (1931) and Cham (1939). Blagden acted as Vice-President of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland during 1923–1933 and 1935–1938, and then honorary Vice-President from 1938 until his death in 1949.

The DCB was created in 1988 in a document signed by eight German cricket clubs. In 1991, the DCB became an Affiliate member of the International Cricket Council. In 1999 it graduated to the level of an Associate, after recommendation by Namibia and Pakistan. It is also a member of the European Cricket Council. History Germany's first separate cricket body, the Deutscher Cricket Bund (DCB), representing teams from Berlin, Nuremberg, Furth, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Mannheim and Hamburg was formed in 1912. The original federation did not last and it was 76 years later that the modern DCB was formed. Today, there are over 100 cricket clubs across Germany, with nearly 3000 players registered in total. The DCB has a budget of about €220,000 ($241,000) per year, most of which comes from the ICC. With an influx of new cricketers migrating to Germany from Asia, especially Afghan refugees, and an increase in junior players learning the game inside in Germany, the number of cricketers registered with the DCB is expected to continue to rise.

At one time it was the centre of a large monastic complex.Middelburg Abdij su Info Middelburg Today parts of what survives are used for a museumHarmans, Gerard M.L. (a cura di), Olanda, Dorling Kindersley, London, 2005 - Mondadori, Milano, 2003 and as offices. Located approximately 65 km (40 miles) west of Bergen op Zoom, Middelburg is the principal town and regional capital of Zeeland in the Netherlands. History The origins of the abbey go back to the early twelfth century or earlier. Premonstratensian monks arrived from St. Michael's Abbey, Antwerp in 1127, creating a monastery on the site of a former Carolingian stronghold.Gambaro, Cristina, Olanda, Giunti, Firenze, 2003, p. 132 The monks established a large religious foundation, eventually incorporating two churches. The monastic foundation also held extensive lands on Walcheren (then an island) and in Zeeland. In 1401 the abbey was brought under direct papal control. Many of the monastic buildings were destroyed in a fire in 1492. Another fire, in 1568 was focused on the two monastic churches. Today many of the surviving buildings from the monastic period (including the so-called \\"new church\\") are in the late Medieval Gothic style, and date from a rebuilding in the second part of the sixteenth century. An important sixteenth century abbot was Nicolaas van der Borcht who in 1559 became the first bishop in the newly formed (and short-lived) Diocese of Middelburg. Monastic life came to an end in 1574 when the Spanish defenders under Cristóbal de Mondragón capitulated to the (Protestant) Dutch separatists at the end of the two year Siege of Middelburg. While negotiating the surrender of the town William of Orange had given guarantees that the clergy would be left alone, but both the abbey and Roman Catholicism in Middelburg were nevertheless forcibly terminated. Meanwhile, the abbey was renamed as the \\"Hof van Zeeland\\" and taken over for use in the secular administration of the province. Initially it was used as the seat of the district assembly (\\"Staten van Zeeland\\") and for other administrative bodies including the locally important admiralty (naval) department, a mint, and a court chamber. Following extensive administrative reforms during the Napoleonic occupation, in 1812 the former abbey complex became known as the \\"Province Building\\" (\\"Provinciehuis\\"). The abbey church was badly damaged in May 1940 by German aerial bombers targeting Middelburg in order to persuade the Dutch army not to hold out against German invasion: during the years of austerity that followed the war rebuilding was not completed till 1965. Other abbey buildings continued to accommodate government activities till the end of the twentieth century, such as the land registry and state archive. Since 1972 a part of the complex has housed the , and in 1986 the \\"Roosevelt Study Center\\" moved into another part. The churches To the south of the cloisters are two Protestant churches which are today still referred to as \\"Abbey Churches\\", reflecting their monastic origins. From the outside they are contiguous, though on the inside it is no longer possible to move from one to the other without leaving the building. Choir church (Koorkerk) Around 1300 the abbey's old church building was replaced with the Choir church (Koorkerk), which is physically divided from adjacent New Church. The church comprises a tall chancel of seven arches in length, with a five sided apse to the east of the choir stalls. As part of the rebuilding after its destruction by fire in 1568, elaborate roof vaulting was added. Plan of the contiguous New church and Choir church in Middelburg A. (east end) Choir church B. (west end) New church C. (south side) Abbey tower D. (dotted) ?former abbey A prominent feature of the town's profile is the abbey church tower known as \\"Lange Jan\\" (\\"Tall John\\"} on the southside of the Choir church. The lower part of the tower dates from the fourteenth century. The more elaborate higher parts were added in 1712 and then reconstructed following the destruction of 1940. New church (Nieuwe Kerk) The New church (51°29'58.96\\"N 3°36'53.08\\"E) features a double nave. In its present configuration it dates from the rebuilding that followed the fire of 1558. It replaced an earlier church built around 1300 which also featured a twin nave despite being smaller. The eastern wall of the New church is also the western wall of the Choir church, and the two interiors were originally connected through an arch, but this was subsequently blocked up. After 1833 the New church became the only parish church for the central walled area of Middelburg. The designation \\"New church\\" was used to differentiate this building from Middleburg's \\"Old church\\", also sometimes called the West or North Minster church, but the old church was torn down in 1833. The \\"New church\\" is notable for its organ, which was built in 1954 by Pels & Van Leeuwen, a firm from Leiderdorp. More eye-catching is the housing that accommodates it, which was originally created in 1693 for a church in Amsterdam by the carpenter-craftsman Jan Albertsz Schut. The organ casing was extensively restored in 1996, the action of the organ itself in 2004.

Julia Child, James Beard, and New York Times food editor Craig Claiborne were all early fans of Longone’s out-of-print cookbook collection.\\"Foodies With A Memory: Ann Arbor's Culinary Historians\\" at Concentrate (18 July 2012) Their enthusiasm prompted her to create The Wine and Food Library in 1972, which offers books by mail order or private appointment and remains one of the most important antiquarian culinary resources in the world. Personal life The second of three children, Longone was born to Alexander and Edith Gropman Bluestein, both Eastern European immigrants. She grew up in a six-family tenement house in the Boston neighborhood of Dorchester. Her father was a kitchen equipment salesman, her mother a homemaker. She recalls lively family dinners when her father would quiz the children over traditional Jewish dishes like gefilte fish and stuffed cabbage rolls.Steve Friess, \\"Cookbook Collector Savors Recipes for Living in Michigan\\" in Forward (28 January 2015) Longone was the first in her family to attend college, enrolling in Bridgewater State Teacher’s College (now Bridgewater State University). She earned a bachelor's degree in history in 1954 and later did graduate work at Cornell University, where she completed coursework toward a Ph.D. in Chinese history. After graduating from college, Longone married her childhood sweetheart, Daniel T. (Dan) Longone, whom she had met as a teenager during summers spent swimming at Revere Beach near Boston.Joel Goldberg, \\"Dan Longone's Grape Expectations at the Clements\\" in Ann Arbor Chronicle (2 May 2009) In 1959 the Longones moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, where Dan had received an appointment in the University of Michigan's Department of Chemistry. He retired as Professor of Organic Chemistry in 1988. The couple was active in Democratic politics. Jan Longone worked on the congressional campaign of Wes Vivian, one of the so-called “Five Fluke Freshmen” who won congressional seats in the Democratic landslide election of 1964. Longone subsequently became District Representative for Michigan’s Second Congressional District. Career When Wes Vivian lost reelection, Longone and her husband began teaching classes on food and wine at the University of Michigan Extension. Their interest in gastronomy had begun soon after they married, when Dan gave Jan a copy of the first Gourmet magazine cookbook. Inside was a coupon for two dollars off a lifetime subscription. As graduate students, the Longones had little money, but they managed to scrape together the forty-eight dollars needed to buy a subscription. Reading Gourmet changed Longone's life. She became passionately interested in recipes and the history and culture behind them.Mary Bilyeu, \\"Still mourning the loss of Gourmet\\" in The Blade (11 November 2014) In 2014 Longone revisited the impact Gourmet had on several generations of readers by organizing an exhibition on \\"The Life and Death of Gourmet--The Magazine of Good Living\\" at the Hatcher Library.The Life and Death of Gourmet – The Magazine of Good Living For two years beginning in 1975 Longone hosted a radio show, “Adventures in Gastronomy,” on National Public Radio affiliate WUOM.

In 2000 the Longones began donating their extensive culinary archive to the University of Michigan to form the Janice Bluestein Longone Culinary Archive. It consists of more than 30,000 items, including cookbooks, culinary manuscripts, menus, and ephemera, all of which are being cataloged by an army of volunteers.

A government-organised rescue operation in 1973 led to the takeover of BSA- Triumph motorcycle operations by Norton-Villiers, later known as Norton Villiers Triumph. At its peak, BSA (including Triumph) was the largest motorcycle producer in the world. In the late 1950s and early 1960s poor management and failure to develop new products in the motorcycle division led to a dramatic decline of sales to its major USA market. The management had failed to appreciate the importance of the resurgent Japanese motorcycle industry, leading to problems for the entire BSA group. When Norton Villiers Triumph was liquidated in 1978, the rights to use the brand name of BSA were purchased by a new business, the B.S.A. Company. Motorcycles Motor bicycles were added to bicycle products in 1910. The BSA 3½ hp was exhibited at the 1910 Olympia Show, London for the 1911 season. The entire BSA production sold out in 1911, 1912 and 1913.Ryerson, Barry (1980). The Giants of Small Heath: The History of BSA. [Sparkford: Haynes]. In November 1919 BSA launched their first 50 degree vee-twin, Model E, 770cc side valve (6–7 hp) motorcycle for the 1920 season.BSA Cycles Ltd 1920 Advertisement Suggestions for BSA Bicycles and Motor Bicycles, The Birmingham Small Arms Company, no ISBN The machine had interchangeable valves, total loss oil system with mechanical pump and an emergency hand one. Retail price was £130. Other features were Amal carburettor, chain drive, choice of magneto or Magdyno, 7-plate clutch, 3 speed gear box with kickstarter and new type of cantilever forkRyerson, Barry 1980 The Giants of Small Heath – The History of BSA, Sparkford, As the result of increased post war demand the Small Heath, Birmingham factory was turned over entirely to motorcycle production. In 1953 BSA withdrew motorcycle production from BSA Cycles Ltd, the company it had established in 1919, by creating BSA Motorcycles Ltd. BSA also produced its 100,000th BSA Bantam motorcycle, a fact celebrated at the 1953 motorcycle show with a visit by Sir Anthony Eden to the BSA stand. Norton-Villiers-Triumph The Group continued to expand and acquire throughout the 1950s, but by 1965 competition from Japan (in the shape of companies like Honda, Yamaha and Suzuki) and Europe from Jawa/CZ, Bultaco and Husqvarna was eroding BSA's market share. The BSA (and Triumph range) were no longer aligned with the markets; mopeds were displacing scooter sales and the trials and scrambles areas were now the preserve of European two-strokes. Some poor marketing decisions and expensive projects contributed to substantial losses. For example, the development and production investment of the Ariel 3, an ultra stable 3-wheel moped, was not recouped by sales; the loss has been estimated at £2 million. Furthermore, BSA failed to take seriously the threat that electric-start Japanese motorcycles might completely destroy the market for kick-started BSA motorcycles. In 1968, BSA announced many changes to its product line of singles, twins and the new three-cylinder machine named the \\"Rocket three\\" for the 1969 model year. It now concentrated on the more promising USA, and to a lesser extent, Canadian markets. However, despite the adding of modern accessories, for example, turn signals and even differing versions of the A65 twins for home and export sale, the damage had been done and the end was near. Reorganisation in 1971 concentrated motorcycle production at Meriden, Triumph's site, with production of components and engines at BSA's Small Heath. At the same time there were redundancies and the selling of assets. Barclays Bank arranged financial backing to the tune of £10 million. Upgrades and service bulletins continued until 1972, but the less service-intensive Japanese bikes had by then flooded the market on both sides of the Atlantic. The merger with Norton Villers was started in late 1972, and for a brief time a Norton 500 single was built with the B50-based unit-single engine, but few if any were sold publicly. The BSA unit single B50's 500 cc enjoyed much improvement in the hands of the CCM motorcycle company allowing the basic BSA design to continue until the mid to late 1970s in a competitive form all over Europe. The final BSA range was just four models: Gold Star 500, 650 Thunderbolt/Lightning and the 750 cc Rocket Three. By 1972, BSA was so moribund that, with bankruptcy imminent, its motorcycle businesses were merged (as part of a government-initiated rescue plan) with the Manganese Bronze company, Norton-Villiers, to become NVT, headed by Dennis Poore. The intention was to produce and market Norton and Triumph motorcycles at home and abroad; but Poore's rationalisation led to redundancies of two-thirds of the workforce. In response, the Triumph workers at Meriden set up their own cooperative. This left Poore with neither BSA nor the iconic Triumph Bonneville model and the only NVT models listed for the 1975 model year were the Norton Commando and the Triumph T160 Trident. Although the Commando won the Motor Cycle News \\"Bike of the Year\\" award for several years running, nothing could hide the fact that the Commando engine was an old design, being a pre-unit pushrod parallel-twin, notwithstanding its effective and revolutionary vibration-damping 'Isolastic' engine mounting system. The T160 was an upgraded triple with a host of improvements such as electric starting and all-disc braking whose engine, built at BSA's Small Heath plant bore, in many ways, a striking similarity to that of the original BSA Rocket 3, being forward-inclined in the frame rather than vertically mounted. This layout was found to give better weight distribution and allowed ancillary components like the starter to be mounted behind the cylinder block, thus apparently vindicating the earlier BSA 'inclined -parallel 3' design. In exchange for its motorcycle businesses, Manganese Bronze received BSA Group's non-motorcycle- related divisions—namely, Carbodies. Although the BSA name was left out of the new company's name, a few products continued to be made carrying it until 1973. However, the plan involved the axing of some brands, large redundancies and consolidation of production at two sites. This scheme to rescue and combine Norton, BSA and Triumph failed in the face of worker resistance. Norton's and BSA's factories were eventually shut down, while Triumph staggered on to fail four years later. Trademarks Motorcycles Rights went to Norton Villiers Triumph and on its liquidation were purchased by a new company formed by management and named BSA Company Limited. Motorcycles from 1910 BSA Motorcycles were made by BSA Cycles Ltd, under the BSA parent, up until 1953 when the motorcycle business was moved into holding BSA Motorcycles Ltd. The first instance of intention to produce motorcycles was reported in The Motor Cycle, a British motorcycling journal, in July 1906.Motor Cycle, 7 July 1966. p.26 Flashbacks to 1906. 16 July 1906. \\"We hear that the Birmingham Small Arms Co Ltd, the makers of well known and renowned BSA fittings, who recently purchased the Government Small Arms factory at Sparkbrook, Birmingham, for motor work, have decided to take up the manufacture of a light motor bicycle\\". Accessed and added 2014-05-29 The first wholly BSA motorcycle, the 3½ H.P. was built in 1910 and displayed at the first Olympia Show, London on 21 November in that year. Sir Hallewell Rogers, BSA Chairman, had informed the shareholders at the Company's 1910 AGM in Birmingham \\"We have decided to put a motor-bicycle on the market for the coming season .... These machines will be on exhibit at the Cycle and Motor Show on November 21st, after which date we look forward to commencing delivery\\". The machines were available for the 1911 season and entire production sold out. BSA had previously acquired a commercially available engine in 1905 and fitted it to one of their bicycle frames and discovered at first hand the problems that needed to be overcome. BSA Cycles Ltd was set up as a subsidiary company in 1919 under Managing Director Charles Hyde to manufacture both bicycles and motorcycles. BSA produced their only two-stroke motorcycle design for the 1928 season, the 1.74 H.P. Model A28 with two speed gearbox. It was produced as the A29 and A30 the following two years and became the A31 with a three-speed gearbox in 1931, the last year of production. The post-war 'Bantam' was a German DKW design, part of war reparation, and not a true BSA design. BSA motorcycles were sold as affordable motorcycles with reasonable performance for the average user. BSA stressed the reliability of their machines, the availability of spares and dealer support. The motorcycles were a mixture of sidevalve and OHV engines offering different performance for different roles, e.g. hauling a sidecar. The bulk of use would be for commuting. BSA motorcycles were also popular with \\"fleet buyers\\" in Britain, who (for example) used the Bantams for telegram delivery for the Post Office or motorcycle/sidecar combinations for AA patrols The Automobile Association (AA) breakdown help services. This mass market appeal meant they could claim \\"one in four is a BSA\\" on advertising. Machines with better specifications were available for those who wanted more performance or for competition work. Initially, after the Second World War, BSA motorcycles were not generally seen as racing machines, compared to the likes of Norton. In the immediate post-war period few were entered in races such as the TT races, though this changed dramatically in the Junior Clubman event (smaller engine motorcycles racing over some 3 or 4 laps around one of the Isle of Man courses). In 1947 there were but a couple of BSA mounted riders, but by 1952 BSA were in the majority and in 1956 the makeup was 53 BSA, 1 Norton and 1 Velocette. To improve US sales, in 1954, for example, BSA entered a team of riders in the 200 mile Daytona beach race with a mixture of single cylinder Gold Stars and twin cylinder Shooting Stars assembled by Roland Pike. The BSA team riders took first, second, third, fourth, and fifth places with two more riders finishing at 8th and 16th. This was the first case of a one brand sweep.BSA: 50 years later The BSA factory experienced success in the sport of motocross with Jeff Smith riding a B40 to capture the 1964 and 1965 FIM 500 cc Motocross World Championships. It would be the last year the title would be won by a four- stroke machine until the mid-1990s. A BSA motocross machine was often colloquially known as a \\"Beezer.\\" Birmingham rocker Steve Gibbons released a song \\"BSA\\" on his 1980 album \\"Saints & Sinners\\" as a tribute to the Gold Star. He still plays this song with his band and often performs on the Isle of Man at the TT races.

She took the name of \\"Klara\\" when she became a nun. She was cleared for beatification in 2015 after Pope Francis recognized a miracle that was found to have been attributed to her intercession. The beatification was celebrated on 27 September 2015 in Poland; Cardinal Angelo Amato presided on behalf of the pope. Life Ludwika Szczęsna was born in Poland in 1863 as the sixth of seven children to Antoni Szczęsny and Franciszka Skorupska. Her mother oversaw her education at home but this was cut short with her mother's death when she was twelve. She continued to live with her father albeit with his second wife. Her father wanted to arrange a marriage for her when she was seventeen but she opposed this and announced to him her intention to follow her vocation and become a professed religious. She left her home at this time in order to follow her calling and she worked as a seamstress until she was 22 in Mlawa. She - at this time - became a spiritual student of Honorat Koźminski. She joined the Servants of Jesus in 1885 and worked as a tailor in addition to serving as the Superior to the local chapter. She was soon given the task of running a shelter for women in Krakow. Szczęsna soon met Józef Sebastian Pelczar in 1893 and the two went on to establish their own religious congregation on 15 April 1894. It was after the establishment that she assumed the name of \\"Klara\\" in honor of Saint Clare of Assisi. The motto that was selected for the new order was \\"All for the Heart of Jesus\\". She served as the first Superior General and opened over 30 houses with the aim of tending to women as well as the sick; this work intensified with the outbreak of World War I. She died at the beginning of 1916 during World War I. Pelczar continued her work after her death until he died in 1924. Beatification The beatification process commenced on 7 April 1994 despite the fact that the local process in Kraków had started on 25 March 1994. The process concluded its work on 15 April 1996 and was ratified on 13 December 1996. The Positio - documentation assembled in the process - was submitted to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome in 2002. Pope Benedict XVI approved that she had lived a life of heroic virtue and proclaimed her to be Venerable on 20 December 2012. The miracle required for beatification was investigated in a process that spanned from 25 April 2004 until 20 March 2007. The process was ratified in 2008 with the documentation sent to Rome. Pope Francis approved the miracle on 5 June 2015 allowing for her to be beatified. She was beatified on 27 September 2015.

The final version of the bill was enacted by the California Legislature in 2015 (passing the State Assembly on a 46-31 voteRebecca Plevin, SB277 update: Calif. state Assembly approves controversial vaccination bill, KPCC (June 25, 2015).SB-277 Public health: vaccinations (2015-2016), California Legislature. and the California State Senate on a 24-14 vote) and was signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown on June 30, 2015. Passage of bill The bill, co-authored by California state Senators Richard Pan and Ben Allen, was prompted by the 2014 Disneyland measles outbreak and low levels of vaccination in pockets of California, with some schools having vaccination rates below 60%. SB277 was supported by the California Medical Association, as well as by the American Academy of Pediatrics' California affiliate; the California State PTA; the California Immunization Coalition; and the California Children's Hospital Association. Opposition to the bill, albeit from \\"a tiny minority\\", has been characterized as \\"possibly the most strident outpouring of political dissent in recent memory\\". Anti-vaccine activists started a petition to have Pan removed by recall election, but failed to obtain the necessary number of voter signatures.Jeremy B. White, Richard Pan recall effort falls short on vaccine issue, Sacramento Bee (January 4, 2016). Efforts by the Freedom Angels Foundation to place a referendum on the ballot to repeal SB 277 also failed. Opponents of the legislation vilified Pan on social media, comparing to a Nazi; death threats were reported against both him and Ben Allen. Upheld by courts During and after the passage of SB 277, legal scholars such as Dorit Rubinstein Reiss of the University of California, Hastings College of the Law and Erwin Chemerinsky and Michele Goodwin of the University of California, Irvine School of Law said that removal of non-medical exceptions to compulsory vaccination laws were constitutional, noting such U.S Supreme Court cases as Zucht v. King (1922) and Prince v. Massachusetts (1944).Erwin Chemerinsky & Michele Goodwin, Essay: Compulsory Vaccination Laws are Constitutional, Northwestern University Law Review, Vol. 110, No. 3, pp. 589-616. After the passage of SB 277, groups of anti-vaccine parents challenged the law in court, arguing that it violated the right to an education, the right to religious freedom, and parental rights; these claims were rejected by the California state courts.Dorit Rubinstein Reiss, A Few Hail Mary Passes: Immunization Mandate Law, SB 277, Brought To Court, Health Affairs (February 28, 2018).Dorit Reiss, California Court of Appeal Rejects Challenge to Vaccine Law, Bill of Health, Harvard Law School, July 30, 2018. Impact Following the law's enactment, vaccination rates among California schoolchildren increased, although unjustified medical exemptions also increased. A 2019 study published in the journal Pediatrics, analyzing the effect of the law, determined that \\"the percentage of incoming kindergarteners up-to-date on vaccinations in California increased after the implementation of SB277,\\" but there was a replacement effect: medical exemptions for independent study/homeschooled students largely offset \\"the decrease in the personal belief exemption rate from 2.37% to 0.56%.\\"Paul L. Delamater, S. Cassandra Pingali, Alison M. Buttenheim, Daniel A. Salmon, Nicola P. Klein & Saad B. Omer, Elimination of Nonmedical Immunization Exemptions in California and School-Entry Vaccine Status, Pediatrics. Vol. 143, Issue 6, June 2019. The study's correlational analysis also found \\"that previous geographic patterns of vaccine refusal persisted after the law's implementation.\\" A separate study, published in 2019 in PLOS Medicine used a synthetic control method to \\"implementation of the California policy that eliminated nonmedical childhood vaccine exemptions was associated with an estimated increase in vaccination coverage and a reduction in nonmedical exemptions at state and county levels,\\" suggesting that the removal of non- medical vaccination exemptions \\"can be effective at increasing vaccination coverage.\\"Sindiso Nyathi, Hannah C. Karpel, Kristin L. Sainani, Yvonne Maldonado, Peter J. Hotez, Eran Bendavid, & Nathan C. Lo, The 2016 California policy to eliminate nonmedical vaccine exemptions and changes in vaccine coverage: An empirical policy analysis, PLOS Medicine (December 23, 2019), doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.1002994. The study determined that the \\"observed increase in medical exemptions was offset by the larger reduction in nonmedical exemptions.\\" The study found that the biggest gains in vaccine coverage were in the counties with the lowest vaccine coverage pre-SB 277.

Career Tojo first learned to cook at home, due in part to the fact his mother was vegetarian and Tojo and his siblings wanted meat. In 1968, Tojo moved to Osaka to become a chef where he apprenticed at Ohnoya, a ryōtei restaurant. In 1971, he became a chef at an Osaka sushi restaurant. Shortly afterwards, in August 1971, Tojo moved to Vancouver (a city with only four Japanese restaurants at the time) where he was a chef at various restaurants until opening his eponymous restaurant, Tojo's, in October 1988. After 18 years at the same location, in 2007 Tojo moved his restaurant to a new custom-designed setting a few blocks east of its original location. Tojo normally works at the restaurant six days a week, but for an annual trip to Japan, in part to stay current with food trends in his home country. Tojo is often credited with inventing the California roll and the B.C. roll. According to Tojo, when he started in Vancouver, Canadian tastes were not used to traditional sushi, with its raw fish and seaweed wrapper. As a result, Tojo chose to use non-traditional ingredients and to roll the sushi inside-out. Originally called \\"Tojo-maki\\", Tojo later changed the name to California roll because of its popularity with visitors from Los Angeles. Tojo's is also known for its omakase, a Japanese term meaning \\"I'll leave it to you\\", in which patrons leave the selection of the menu to the chef. In addition to many newspaper and magazine reviews, Tojo has appeared on numerous television programs, including Martha Stewart Living, Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations, Anna & Kristina's Grocery Bag, Bizarre Foods America, Glutton for Punishment, 1,000 Places to See Before You Die, Simply Ming, and The Today Show. In 2016, the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries appointed Tojo as a goodwill ambassador of Japanese cuisine, one of only 13 chefs to share this honour outside Japan.
