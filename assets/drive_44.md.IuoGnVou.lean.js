Encompassing a number of programs supported with relatively small amounts of funding, the initiative is intended to circumvent bureaucracy and engage new entrepreneurs in Air Force programs. AFWERX was officially announced by Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson on 21 July 2017 during her visit to Nellis Air Force Base. The program is partially based on the structure of Air Force Special Operations Command, and has been described as an \\"Island of misfit toys\\" for entrepreneurs in the Air Force. Secretary Wilson stated that the program would \\"increase lethality at a lower cost\\".  Purpose  AFWERX is intended to engage inter and extra service innovators and entrepreneurs in the operations of the United States Air Force. The goal of the programs under the AFWERX umbrella is to develop effective solutions to the challenges facing the service through partnerships with private sector business entities, with particular emphasis being placed on collaboration with technology startups.  Technology accelerator  Through AFWERX, the Air Force launched a technology accelerator program in September 2017. The technology accelerator program emphasizes the development and implementation of autonomous technologies. The goal of these developments is to increase the ability of the Air Force assets to detect, identify, attribute, and mitigate autonomous technologies. Boston based company PBTS LLC and entrepreneur networking service Techstars were contracted to operate the first accelerator program in conjunction with AFWERX.  Locations  The first functioning AFWERX location was announced to be opening at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas in 2018, where, according to the Air Force, groups will be able to present ideas for evaluation by the service branch. The Vegas location opened in early June 2018. AFWERX opened a new facility in Austin, Texas also in June 2018, and later opened a third location in Washington D.C.

E. Oppenheim. David Ernst Oppenheim (20 April 1881 ‚Äî 18 February 1943) was an Austrian educator and psychologist who collaborated with Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler. David Ernst Oppenheim was born in Br√ºnn, Moravia, in Austria- Hungary, to a Jewish family, and educated at the University of Vienna where he studied philology and archaeology, graduating in 1904. He worked as a professor of Greek and Latin at a gymnasium in Vienna, and was interested in the ancient history and mythology. Around 1909 he contacted Sigmund Freud, and in January 1910 was accepted as a member of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Association where he gave talks on the fire as a sexual symbol and on suicides at school age. Together with Freud, he wrote a manuscript entitled ‚ÄúDreams in Folklore‚Äù in 1911 which was only published in 1958, because Oppenheim left the Association and instead joined the school of Individual Psychology of Alfred Adler in 1911. Oppenheim had an important position within the new school, and he wrote several articles in the Internationale Zeitschrift f√ºr Individualpsychologie. Oppenheim took part in World War I at the Italian front but later became a pacifist and an active member in the Social Democratic Party of Austria. In 1938, when Austria was annexed to the Third Reich, Oppenheim intended to emigrate to Australia where his daughters lived, but because of an illness he was not able take the trip. In 1942, he and his wife Amalie were transported to the concentration camp in Terez√≠n where he died of diabetes in 1943.

Born around 1000, probably to a Hessian-Thuringian noble family, he was possibly educated in the Benedictine Hersfeld Abbey, in Hesse. Certainly from 1046 he was a monk there, and that year was appointed abbot of Tegernsee Abbey, in Bavaria; in 1047 he also became abbot of :de:Kloster Ebersberg. When Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor, was in Fulda, toward the end of 1047, then- abbot Rohing died, and Henry had the monks choose Egbert as their new abbot. He was confirmed as abbot by Henry in 1049, and later that year was granted a confirmation of the Fulda exemption, as a weapon in the ongoing struggle for power (and Fulda's independence) with the Bishopric of W√ºrzburg. To strengthen the claims, he had a new vita written of Saint Boniface, on whose orders Fulda Abbey had been built in 744, and engaged Otloh of Sankt Emmeram to write it. In Regensburg, Otloh had managed to pick up a copy of the so-called Karlsruhe Codex of the Boniface correspondence, which Egbert had ordered and sent to Pope Leo IX (Leo was interested in rewriting the saint's vita but died before he had the chance). The exemption for Fulda was again confirmed by Henry III in 1056. Abbot Egbert was known for having enlarged the possessions of Fulda, and for his zeal in building. In 1048 he had new sleeping quarters built for the monks. He rebuilt the neglected collegiate church on the nearby Frauenberg, just north of Fulda, into a Benedictine abbey, ca. 1050.

Green is an international leader in the epidemiology of melanoma and skin cancer.{{cite weburl=https://www.science.org.au/profile/adele-greenwebsite= Australia Academy of Science She is best known for her contributions to the area of melanoma prevention, for which in 2013 she received the Queensland Australian of the Year Award and The Australian Financial Review and Westpac 100 Women of Influence Award. Education  Green was educated at the University of Queensland medical school in the 1970s. Despite considering a career in English literature or diplomatic service, she chose medicine due to her interest in biology, as well as being influenced by well-known female scientists such as Marie Curie. She received 1st class honours in Medicine and worked as a clinician for several years before receiving her PhD in epidemiology in 1984 from the University of Queensland. Green also holds an M.Sc. from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.  Research Highlights In 1986, Green began her 20-year landmark study in the rural Queensland town of Nambour of sunscreen usage, where half of 1621 participants applied sunscreen daily and the rest maintained previous sporadic sunscreen application habits. These participants were followed initially for 10 years, with the results showing the application of sunscreen halved the chance of developing melanoma. This ground-breaking randomised controlled trial of long- term sunscreen application in an Australian community provided the scientific basis for clinical and public health advice about sunscreen use for skin cancer prevention. Her other significant contributions include insight into risk factors for ovarian cancer and into the burden of cancer in Indigenous Australians. Green has received international awards and is a recognised advocate for cancer control, including through longstanding membership on national and international scientific and advisory councils. She has trained and mentored a generation of epidemiologists and clinician-scientists. Green has also done research into other cancers, such as esophageal cancer and ovarian cancer. Studies of these cancers occurred in 2008 in the research project 'Towards Cancer Control ‚Äî population and molecular strategies'.  Professional career  In 1985, using a Neil Hamilton Fairley Postdoctoral Travelling Fellowship awarded by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), she travelled to the UK, where at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine she earned an MSc in Epidemiology. During this time she also served as a visiting Lecturer in Medicine at Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA. Green joined QIMR's Epidemiology and Population Health Unit in 1996 and was appointed a Senior Principal Research Fellow. She was the visiting medical research officer at the Wellcome Trust in London in 1997. From 2000 - 2011 Green acted as the deputy director to QIMR. During this time period she simultaneously operated in a variety of roles: in 2000 as the Head of Cancer and Population Studies Group in QIMR, in 2002 as a professor at both the University of Queensland and the Queensland University of Technology. In 2005 she was appointed as an adjunct professor at Griffith University and in 2009 as a professor at the Institute of Inflammation and Repair, as well as at the University of Manchester. In 2010 she was appointed as the acting director of QIMR. In 2014 she served as a senior research scientist at the Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute at the University of Manchester. She is currently a senior scientist at QIMR, a position she has held since 2012. Green has served on many Australian research bodies, such as the Australian Cancer Research Foundation's Medical Research Advisory Committee, the National Public Health Partnership, and the National Health and Medical Research Council and was Chair of the NHMRC's Health Advisory Committee (2000-2005). Apart from Australian research bodies, she has also served on many committees at the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in Lyon, France. These have included: Chair of the Working Group on Artificial UV and Skin Cancer in 2005, member of the Working Group on Code of Good Practice for IARC Researchers (2006-2008), and member of the Working Party for the Monograph on Radiation and Cancer in 2009.

He ruled from June 23, 970 to his death in battle on July 13, 982.  Background  In 947, the Fatimid caliph al-Mansur bi-Nasr Allah sent al-Hasan ibn Ali al-Kalbi to subdue a revolt on Sicily, where he would go on to establish his own ruling dynasty, the Kalbids. Al-Hasan was succeeded by his son, Ahmad ibn al-Hasan al-Kalbi, in 954. In 969 Ahmad was recalled to North Africa to assist in subduing a revolt by Berber tribesmen. Briefly in 969, one of Ahmad's freed slaves, Ya'ish, was appointed governor of Sicily. The next year Abu'l-Qasim, Ahmad's brother, was elevated to governor.  Rule  During the spring of 976, Abu'l-Qasim launched a raiding expedition on Byzantine Italy. His first target was the city of Messina, which he found deserted upon arrival. He soon moved on to Apulia, taking tribute from Cosenza before sending his brother to raid the surrounding countryside. He soon crossed the straits back to Sicily. During the summer of the same year, Abu'l-Qasim crossed back to mainland Italy, where he quickly forced tribute out of St. Agatha and took and razed Taranto. He then sent one army to Otranto while he besieged Gravina, before retiring to Muslim lands for the year, bringing home hundreds of captives as slaves. In May 982, Abu'l-Qasim returned to Italy hoping to confront the advancing German emperor Otto II. Around Rossano Calabro, Abu'l-Qasim spotted the German army and realized that he had hugely underestimated its size. He attempted to retreat back to Sicily, but Otto caught up with him around Capo Colonna. In the Battle of Stilo, the outnumbered Kalbid force was able to surround and defeat the German forces with an unexpectedly strong cavalry charge; Otto himself only escaped by swimming to a Greek merchant ship,The Place of Byzantium in the Medieval World, Steve Runciman, The Cambridge Medieval History, Vol. IV., Part II, ed.

Recognizing the youth's efforts in peace building, it provides a set of guidelines upon which policies and programs will be developed by member states, the UN and civil society. This global policy framework, adopted by the UNSC in December 2015, explores how conflict impacts young people's lives and what must be done to mitigate its effects, as well as how youth can be meaningfully included in creating peaceful communities.

It is Clinton's first novel. A television adaptation was being developed by Showtime, and Clinton and Patterson are teaming up to again write another novel set to be released in June 2021. Plot The book begins with US President Jonathan Lincoln Duncan rehearsing a potential testimony with a House of Representatives select committee. It has been discovered that the president made a phone call to Suliman Cindoruk, the leader of the cyberterrorist group Sons of Jihad, and he is accused of negotiating with a terrorist. It was also discovered that the president ordered an attack to stop some Ukrainian operatives in Algeria who were attempting to kill Suliman. In the attack, an American CIA operative was killed and Suliman escaped. The president's aides advise him against testifying at the hearing, believing it will only lead to impeachment proceedings. Duncan has had immune thrombocytopenia‚Äîa disease causing low platelet count‚Äîfor most of his political career, and the disorder has recently flared up again recently, forcing him to take steroids that impair his mental ability. Duncan then meets with the Speaker of the House, who has been the primary advocate for impeachment, and unsuccessfully attempts to convey to him the strategic importance of his suspicious-looking decisions. Duncan's daughter, who is studying in Paris, receives a message with the code \\"Dark Ages\\" from a young Eastern European woman named Nina. She tells her father about the strange person and the message, and she is requested to come back home immediately. The code word was known only to eight people, all high-ranking Cabinet or Cabinet-level officials, and is the code name for a cybersecurity operation that America is running after its systems were hacked. Determined to know the source of the leak, the president invites Nina to the White House. She tells the president that she only has half of the information the president needs. In order to get the full story, he must meet with her partner, who will give him the remaining pieces of the puzzle. Nina asks Duncan to meet her partner in a stadium where a baseball game is scheduled to take place later that week on a Friday. The president arrives at Nationals Park, incognito and without Secret Service protection, and meets the partner, named Augie. Meanwhile, mercenaries who were contracted by Suliman Cindoruk‚Äîa sniper known as Bach and two ground units‚Äîprepare to ambush and assassinate Nina and Augie. As Augie and the president leave the stadium, the assassin shoots and kills Nina, who was waiting in a van for the president and Augie, and the ground units converge. Duncan, who fought in the Gulf War with the Army Rangers, takes Augie's gun and manages to shoot two members of the ground team. The arrival of the Secret Service stops the shootout, and the president and Augie are extracted. The Secret Service, ignoring the president's demands, had followed him after seeing the baseball tickets while searching Nina earlier at the White House. The president's convoy heads to Virginia, but they are ambushed again. Two Secret Service agents are killed in the ensuing attack, but the president is unharmed and drives off with Augie. He arrives at a safe house, where he takes stock of the events of the evening. He learns that Nina and Augie created and distributed a highly destructive computer virus for Suliman, but they left and warned the US when they realized what it would do. The virus is scheduled to take effect the next day, which begins in a few hours. In the morning, a Laboratory Response Network building in Los Angeles is destroyed in an explosion, and soon after, investigators discover that a large California water treatment plant was hacked and was about to distribute contaminated water. Believing it to be a decoy, the president keeps his top cybersecurity team working on the virus threat instead of diverting them to help in California. He had previously arranged a covert meeting with leaders from three other major countries. The Prime Minister of Israel and the Chancellor of Germany arrive and are greeted warmly, and Augie explains the full extent of Dark Ages: it is an attack that would completely destroy the data on every internet-connected device in the US, leaving the country vulnerable to outside attack and forcing the government to retreat from its foreign policy objectives. The President of Russia was invited but sent the Prime Minister in his place; this creates distrust among the other delegations, who see it as another sign that Russia is sponsoring the attack. Duncan reveals that the US military has quickly built a rudimentary international network to maintain defensive abilities in the event of the Dark Ages virus launching. Duncan begins to suspect his vice president of being the leaker. She is still bitter that Duncan had beat her in the primaries, and she would take over as president if Duncan were impeached. The cybersecurity team, with Duncan's help, discover a way of rendering the virus ineffective, so they test it on a server at the Pentagon. This test inadvertently sets off the virus throughout the nation, but it is suspended after deleting only a few files. If the correct disable keyword is not entered in thirty minutes, Dark Ages will wipe everything out. At the same time, Bach and Suliman's other mercenaries attack again to kill Augie, but they are stopped by the Secret Service and a Marine Corps helicopter, and Bach is captured. Duncan assembles his top aides to try to guess the password, and at the last second his chief of staff correctly guesses the password and disables the virus. As they return to the White House, Duncan reveals that he had actually earlier entered the password, which he got from text messages with the anonymous leaker recovered from Nina's phone. Assembling his team to guess was just a ruse to lure the leaker into the light. The president confronts his chief of staff and tells her that he has evidence that she leaked \\"Dark Ages\\", and she tipped off Suliman as well. She had tried to frame the vice president, so she could be the hero and then take over as vice president, rescuing a once-promising political career nearly ended by a microphone gaffe. Duncan learns that Suliman had been sponsored by Russia and a faction in the House of Saud, both of whom wanted to weaken the superpower status of the US so they could expand their territory without interference. The president's popularity soars, and impeachment talks are dropped. Cancelled television adaptation Clinton and Patterson went on a 16-meeting tour to select the right outlet for a theatrical film. However, Showtime initially announced that they were turning the book into an ongoing drama series. Showtime president and CEO David Nevins said that \\"the pairing of President Clinton with fiction‚Äôs most gripping storyteller promises a kinetic experience, one that the book world has salivated over for months and that now will dovetail perfectly into a politically relevant, character-based action series for our network.\\" On October 14, 2020, it was announced that due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the series would not move forward at Showtime.  Reception  In his review of the novel for The New Yorker, Anthony Lane argues that The President Is Missing \\"maximizes its potency and fulfills its mission\\" while commenting negatively on the book's prose, the absurdity of its plot, and the use of product placement. James O'Sullivan published an analysis in The Guardian which uses stylometry to show that the novel was primarily written by Patterson. In a negative review, Will Gompertz of the BBC gave the novel 1 out of 5 stars, calling it \\"predictable, dull and uninteresting\\". The book topped The New York Times Best Seller list by the June 24 edition. Alfred A. Knopf announced that the book sold 250,000 copies in all formats during its first week. Nielsen Bookscan, which represents around 85 percent of print book sales, reported that at least 152,000 of the copies sold in its first week were hardcover. The book's first week sales were the highest in the adult fiction genre since the 2015 release of Go Set a Watchman and the highest in fiction since the November 2017 release of Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Getaway. The book again topped the Best Seller list for the July 1 edition. The book would again top the Best Seller for the July 8 edition as well. The book would also top the Best Seller list for the July 15 edition. By July 6, 2018, Publishers Weekly stated that the book sold nearly 384,000 copies by the end of June and was the top selling new novel for the entire first half of 2018. The book would also top the Best Seller list for the July 22 edition. It then topped the Best Seller list for the July 29 edition. On August 8, Knopf announced that the book sold one million copies in North America alone.

During the twelve Nazi years he was involved in active resistance, spending approximately three years in prison and a further seven years as a political refugee in London.  Life  Heinz Heinrich Schmidt was born into a working-class family in Halle. He attended school locally and trained for work as a miner. After briefly working in the mines, in 1926 he joined the Social Democratic Party (\\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / SPD), and was recruited to edit various party newspapers. Between 1930 and 1933 he undertook a period of further study in Halle, covering constitutional and civil law. During that period of study, in 1931, he joined the Communist Party. In January 1933 the Nazi Party took power and lost no time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. After the Reichstag fire in February 1933 communists found themselves identified as enemies of the state. Schmidt continued with his party activism which was now illegal. He was arrested in 1934 and served his three year sentence in the Brandenburg-G√∂rden super jail and as an inmate at the Lichtenburg concentration camp. Released in 1937 he escaped to Prague, emigrating from there to London where he arrived in or before 1938. In London he will have been identified as an enemy alien and incarcerated for a time, but he was also able to join the local branch of the exiled German communist party, becoming leader of the little group in 1941. Two years later, in 1943, using the pseudonym \\"Jack Morrell\\", he became Editor-in-chief of the \\"Freie Trib√ºne\\", a London based newspaper published by and for the exiled German communists who had fetched up in Britain. He continued to serve in this capacity till war ended in the early summer of 1945. When he returned to Germany in 1946 it was to his home region which was part of a large chunk of what had been central Germany that by now was being administered as the Soviet occupation zone. The region was being subjected to a carefully planned Soviet sponsored nation building exercise headed up by an elite team of German communists who, in contrast to the treatment afforded to others who had fled to the Soviet Union, had been flown in from Moscow at the end of April 1945. Most of the communists who had fled Nazi Germany and survived the experience had spent the war years in Moscow. Smaller groups had lived in western capitals including London, but many of these did not return to Germany after the war, or at least not to the Soviet occupation zone. Those, such as Heinz Schmidt, that did were branded as \\"Westemigranten\\" (\\"Western emigrants\\") and viewed with a certain amount of suspicion by the men who after 1949 would form the backbone of the East German political establishment: there was a concern, shared by Stalin himself, that living in the west might have corrupted or diminished their credentials as loyal pro- Soviet comrades. However, Schmidt lost no time in signing his party membership over to the newly formed Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED) and took a job with the party, serving briefly in a senior capacity in the party's information department (\\"Leiter der Hauptabteilung Tagesfragen sowie als Chefredakteur\\"). That lasted till 31 July 1947 when he took over from Max Seydewitz as Intendant (loosely: \\"director general\\") of the Berliner Rundfunk (radio channel).Berliner Zeitung, 1 August 1947, p. 2. October 1949 was the month in which the Soviet occupation zone was relaunched as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany). A more personal change of direction for Heinz Schmidt came on 20 October 1949 when the Politburo removed him from his post at Berlin Radio, citing his \\"nationalistic arrogance\\" and \\"insufficient political vigilance\\" (\\"nationalistischer √úberheblichkeit [und] ungen√ºgender politischer Wachsamkeit\\"). Between 1950 and 1955 he was employed on a \\"provisional contract\\" in the production department. In 1955/56 he was appointed editor in chief on Das Magazin, a recently launched arts and lifestyle magazine. In 1956 he was switched to the same position on the satirical magazine Eulenspiegel. However, in 1958 he was removed from that post. He was now installed as head of the press department at the National Council of the National Front, which was a political structure used by the ruling SED (party) to control the other political parties. He had already, in 1957, been appointed a member of the presidium and secretary of the National Front. In 1964 he was given the honorary presidency of the country's Afro-Asian solidarity committee, a position in which he continued to serve till 19 November 1976. That was when, on health grounds, he was replaced in the role by Kurt Seibt.Neues Deutschland, 20 February 1976, p. 2.  Personal  In his personal life, by August 1946, when the two of them moved together to Berlin, Heinz Schmidt had teamed up with the pioneering physician Eva Schmidt-Kolmer. They married in 1947. The marriage produced two children. Heinz Heinrich Schmidt died in Berlin on 14 September 1989 aged 82.Traueranzeigen in der Berliner Zeitung, 3 October 1989, p. 10.

Ream, who had achieved some degree of fame as a teenager for her 1866 statue of Lincoln that stands in the Capitol, learned that the State of Iowa had decided to commission a statue of Kirkwood. Despite the fact that Kirkwood had been one of the Congressmen who had voted against awarding the Lincoln statue to Ream, she set about getting and succeeded in garnering the opportunity to do it.

She was the first important lover of American heiress Joe Carstairs. Biography Catherine Ruth Baldwin was born on 17 February 1905 in England. In the 1920s in London she was known for her use of heroin, cocaine and alcohol. It has been said that she turned the kitchen of the house where she lived with Joe Carstairs into a bar. Carstairs' friends later said, \\"She was wild. She was such fun. Ruth, she was really wild.\\" She said to Carstairs, \\"The world is one's oyster if taken at will.\\" Her circle of friends included painter Edward Burra and society portrait photographers Barbara Ker-Seymer and Olivia Wyndham, the last possibly her lover as well. When Carstairs purchased her first motorboat, Baldwin gave her a Steiff doll; Carstairs named it Lord Tod Wadley. She became exceptionally attached to this doll, keeping it with her until her death. She had clothes made for it in Savile Row and had its name placed with her own on the name plaque on the door of her London apartment at 5 Mulberry Walk (\\"Marion Barbara Carstairs and Lord Tod Wadley\\"). Nina Hamnett took a portrait of Baldwin in Paris. Baldwin died of a suspected overdose at a Chelsea party at the home of Gwen Farrar on 31 August 1937, while her friends, among whom Dolly Wilde, listened to a boxing match in the next room. A photograph of her appeared on The Times on 2 September 1937 announcing her death. She had short hair and a mannish tie, probably alluding to the fact she was lesbian; the article also said she was sharing a house with Carstairs. Carstairs crossed the Atlantic from Whale Cay aboard the French liner Normandie, the most expensive ship in the world, and took Baldwin's ashes along with her to Whale Cay, where she built a church to house them. When she sold Whale Cay, she removed the ashes. When Carstairs died in Naples, Florida, in 1993 at the age of 93, Lord Tod Wadley was cremated with her. Their ashes and those of Ruth Baldwin were buried in Oakland Cemetery in Sag Harbor, New York.

Well known for his key role as founder of gang and music group PDC, Jaja released his debut studio album Streetboy in 2008, along with his second alnum, I Love Music in 2009, followed by his Illegal Download album in 2010, all of which were distributed independently. His fourth studio album, The Last Message was released in 2012 and went to No. 19 in the iTunes Hiphop chart. His influence in and around British street culture as a key figure and rap legend has seen him appear on many of the popular media and music platforms, such as with Tim Westwood, talking about his experiences and influencing the up-and-coming generations.  Early life  Jaja Soze was born Elijah Kerr on 16 February 1980 in Birmingham, England, to parents from Jamaica. He is the oldest of five siblings and grew up in Handsworth, Birmingham. Kerr attended the Westminster Primary school where he grew up, looking up to the local sound systems of the '80s whilst also being inspired by a popular local gang called the \\"Incheyes\\" who later would split up into the Johnsons and Burger Bar gangs. Because of domestic disputes in his family, Kerr moved to Brixton, on the Angell Town Estate in South London in the early '90s where he then became heavily involved in crime, and convicted in 1996 at the age of just 15, for a bank robbery. He would then later be convicted and jailed at age 22, for drug-dealing. Soze grew up heavily influenced by gang culture, especially that of a well known, early '90s gang that he had grew up seeing in Brixton, called the 28s. Soze then grew to be a part of a well known London gang known as the Peel Dem Crew, of which he later founded and transformed into PDC rap group, also known as Poverty Driven Children or P.D.C. as told in a book written about his journey called Street Boys, written by himself and Tim Pritchard and published by HarperCollins.  Career  Soze began creating music at the age of 12 years old (1992), heavily influenced by his upbringing of Rastafarian music with a mix of early American '90s hip hop like that of Public Enemy and UK London Posse which was rumoured to have sparked his interest in starting his own street type movement. Him and his friends would later go on to set up PDC rap group and create a massive platform for young disadvantaged youth, to be able to express their opinions and struggles of the UK street culture, via music. Soze's music today is seen as a controversial message of revolution and street culture, with a deep message some will consider as \\"black power\\" or music with a humanitarian feel.

The sole species Seppo koponeni is known from a single fossil from Grimmen, Germany. With the scorpion Liassoscorpionides, it is one of the two only known arachnids from the Lower Jurassic of Germany. Seppo is the First unequivocal Early Jurassic Spider, and was recovered from the Green Series member of the Toarcian Ciechocinek Formation. Description The spider was described from single female specimen, that is unkonow if was an Adult. The Carapace is unknown, and besides that has preserved bowed converging sides with a curved posterior margin with straight posterior border of the labium , with row of at least 12 peg teeth along Cheliceral Furrow, no true teeth, scattered setae on anterior surface, slender Pedipalps. Legs are preserved, being the I, II much longer than III, IV, and all well covered in setae and bristles, especially on the tibiae and metatarsi of leg I. It most likely belongs to the Palpimanoidea, on account specially of the presence of cheliceral peg teeth. Discovery The single Know specimen was found on locality known for its fossil insects in Grimmen, near Greifswald, at the north of Germany. It was reported in 2003, when Ansorge did a recopilation of Insect Taxa on the Toarcian strata of Germany and England.Ansorge, J. (2003) Insects from the Lower Toarcian of Middle Europe and England. Acta Zoologica Cracoviensia, 46 (suppl. -Fossil Insects), 291‚Äì310 The Specimen was recovered from the Falciferum zone (Exaratum subzone), c. 180 Ma, and presented as \\"Araneae gen. et sp. nov.\\" (Chelicerata). It was recovered from a fragment of calcareous nodule from the grey-green Claystone, recovered from the closed since the 90¬¥s Clay Pit of Klein Lehmhagen, near Grimmen, Western Pomerania, Germany. It is curious for be one of the rare few examples of Spiders found on Calcium Carbonate (Along with others from the Eocene Limestone of the Isle of Wight, EnglandSelden, P.A. (2001) Eocene spiders from the Isle of Wight with preserved respiratory structures. Palaeontology, 44, 695 729.http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1475-4983.00199). The specimen was found with some parts preserved as external moulds, and these show Setation and Spination, being this as an exception, since mostly of the specimen is an internal mould of calcium carbonate. The Specimen was labeled with the number MB.A 2966, and deposited in the Museum f√ºr Naturkunde, Berlin, being named in 2014 by Paul A. Selden & Jason A. Dunlop Seppo koponeni, after the Finish Arachnologist Seppo Koponen, to celebrate his 70th birthday. Ecology Seppo koponeni reconstruction on a Tree, as suggested for its Leg III morphology Seppo koponeni is one of the only two arachnids ever to have been found in the Toarcian rocks of north Germany, outnumbered by several thousand insect specimens at several localities.Ansorge, J. (2007) Liastongrube Grimmen. Biuletyn Pa≈Ñstwowego Instytutu Geologicznego, 424, 37‚Äì41. The different between the number of insects as opposed to arachnids has not been studied in depth. A possibility is that because insects can fly over water, they fall into it far more easily than spiders.Selden, P.A., Anderson, H.M. & Anderson, J.M. (2009) A review of the fossil record of spiders (Araneae) with special reference to Africa, and description of a new specimen from the Triassic Molteno Formation of South. African Invertebrates, 50, 105‚Äì116 It is unclear how the spider ended on a marine clay deposit, far from the land, although several theories have been suggested: ballooning is a possibility as a method of transport, perhaps helped by severe storms, hurricanes, and tornadoes. Another possibility might be that it was carried out to sea on floating vegetation, as wood remains have been recovered in the deposit. On nearby land, ground dwellers were represented by arachnids, such as Seppo and scorpions, but also by Gryllidae, such as Protogryllus dobbertinensis, grylloblattodeans such as Nele jurassica, and dermapterans. These arthropods never moved far from where they lived and are generally very rare in the rocks. Seppo shows a rather unusual morphology, with large and porrect chelicerae and a robust leg I, contrasted with a short leg III. The robust and well-armed first legs, directed forwards, give the impression that they were prey capture appendages, a morphology typical of a sit-and-wait predator, while the short third legs are more typical of web spiders, especially orbweavers, but also palpimanoids. Short third legs are not usually found on spiders that are substrate dwellers, which have more equal legs. Seppo was probably not a habitual ground dweller. The armoured front legs related to capturing dangerous prey are typical of many extant palpimanoids that are araneophagous.

It is set in Kenya during the 1950s; during that time, Kenya was under British rule. The British colony is facing a Kenyan uprising known as the Mau Mau Rebellion. The majority of the fertile farmland is under British control, and the best the Kenyans can hope for is to work the land as tenant farmers, giving the majority of their yield to the British. While the Kenyans work the land, they live under oppressive conditions and under constant threat of violence. The Mau Mau rebellion seeks to rid the land of the British colonizers and give the country back to Kenyans.  Synopsis  The narrator and main character is Kariuki, a young Kenyan boy living under the oppressive rule of a British plantation owner named Bwama Ruin. While near a watering hole, Kariuki meets Bwama's nephew Nigel, who is fishing. Nigel is a white boy from Britain staying in Kenya for the summer. He is one year younger than Kariuki and is unaware of the systematic oppression of the Kenyan people. Kariuki and Nigel quickly become friends. Nigel quickly gains the title of ‚ÄúThe Mzungu Boy‚Äù, meaning \\"white boy\\", by the older boys of the village. Nigel immediately falls in love with hunting on the prairies of Africa. He especially enjoys hunting Old Moses, which according to Kariuki is the oldest, toughest warthog in the world. Kariuki's older brother Hari is part of the Mau Mau rebellion. During one of Nigel's and Kariuki's hunting expeditions, they get separated. Bwama Ruin calls in the British army to search for Nigel. When Kariuki goes to search for Nigel, he finds him captured by the Mau Mau. Kariuki frees Nigel but while they try to escape, they both get captured by the Mau Mau. Although the Mau Mau want to kill them both, Kariuki's brother Hari frees them. Nigel and Kariuki run back to the town while the Mau Mau attempt to flee from the British soldiers by hiding in the mountains. When the boys get back to the plantation, they go to Bwama Ruin's estate to find that British soldiers have found and killed Hari as he tried to flee with the Mau Mau rebels. Kariuki runs out of the town overcome with emotion; the book ends with Nigel, \\"The Mzungo Boy\\", finding and comforting Kariuki.  Character list  * Bwama Ruin: British landowner in Kenya.

Klieger, a survivor of the Nazi concentration camps Auschwitz, Mittelbau-Dora and Ravensbruck, covered trials of Nazi criminals after the end of World War II, besides working as a sports journalist in Israel. He also was the president of the basketball club Maccabi Tel Aviv and chairman of the FIBA's media council. In 2010 he was awarded the FIBA Order of Merit, and in 2012 became a Chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur. In 2015, Klieger was inducted into the FIBA Hall of Fame for his contributions.  Early life  Klieger was born in 1925 in Strasbourg. His older brother Jonathan was born in Germany, but their family later relocated, first to France, and then to Belgium in 1938. After the start of WWII, when Belgium fell under Nazi occupation, 13-year-old Klieger helped found a Zionist youth underground organization. Members of his group passed messages between adult underground cells, helped obtain ration stamps, and smuggled Belgian Jews to Switzerland. Overall, Klieger's cell successfully smuggled some 270 Jews to this neutral country. However, when his own turn came to leave Belgium in 1942, he was caught at the border by the Germans. Klieger was interned for a period of time in the Mechelen transit camp and in January 1944 he was sent to Auschwitz. There he contracted pneumonia and expected to be put to death, but, as Klieger recalled later, he personally addressed chief physician Mengele and other physicians who accompanied him and succeeded in persuading them that he still could be of use. One of the doctors agreed to send him back to barracks. Later he was saved from extermination by an extraordinary stroke of luck: one of the SS officers running the camp turned out to be an avid boxing fan and decided to form a boxing team of Auschwitz prisoners. Despite having no previous boxing experience, 16-year-old Klieger volunteered to join the team. Other team members who did have such experience in the pre-war world read his bluff but helped him stay on the team, withholding their own hits and allowing him to hit them. Together with his teammates Noah was fed better than other prisoners and sometimes even received soup from the officers' mess. They were also exempt from work in the afternoon hours so that they could train. In all other respects, they were treated no better than other prisoners and sometimes even harsher, to show them that their athlete status did not carry privileges. When the Red Army started closing on Auschwitz in January 1945, the remaining prisoners were transferred on foot to Germany. After a three-day long death march the survivors, including Klieger, were sent to the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp. There he succeeded in fooling the Germans for the second time by pretending to be a precision mechanics expert and was sent to the underground plant producing missiles. On April 4 he was once again sent by foot with the rest of the prisoners to another concentration camp, this time Ravensbruck. This death march took 10 days, but on April 29 Klieger and other Ravensbruck prisoners were freed by the Red Army. Journalism career After returning from the camps Klieger started a career as a journalist. As a reporter he covered Nazi criminal trials in Belgium, France, and Germany. In Belgium he reunited with his parents, who also survived Auschwitz; his father Abraham started publishing a German-language magazine for Belgian Jews, and Noah translated articles in this magazine to French. When Klieger learned about Aliyah Bet, an illegal immigration operation allowing European Jews to come to the Mandatory Palestine, he joined forces with the organizers. In 1947 he became one of the illegal immigrants aboard the ship Exodus 1947, initially as a passenger and later as a crew member. Shortly after he arrived in Mandatory Palestine, the 1947‚Äì48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine started, and he joined the Haganah as a volunteer. In the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War he took part in Operation Danny, then was included in the \\"French commando\\" squad and finally became a soldier of the Negev Brigade and fought in the South. After the end of 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, Klieger resumed his journalistic career. He became a L‚Äô√âquipe correspondent in Israel in 1953 and also one of the founders of the first sports section in an Israeli newspaper. From 1957 he was a staff member of the mainstream daily Yedioth Ahronoth for which he also wrote a personal column till the age of 90. In particular, he covered the trials of Adolf Eichmann and Ivan (John) Demjanjuk held in Israel, and frequently published pieces about Holocaust survivors. He continued taking part in the March of the Living, the annual international educational program dedicated to Holocaust history. Sports Klieger took a major part in the development of Israeli sports as an executive and administrator. From 1951 to 1968 he served as the chairman of Maccabi Tel-Aviv Basketball Club, and from 1970 to 1998 as the chairman of the Maccabi Ramat-Gan Omni-Sport Club. Klieger was a member of the Maccabi World Union Executive for 14 years. He was also a major fixture in the development of European basketball, participating in FIBA's activities since 1951. He chaired FIBA's media council and the Basketball Commission of Association Internationale de la Presse Sportive for over 25 years and was a press advisor to FIBA's Secretary-General and FIBA Europe Secretary-General.  Awards and recognition  In 2010, Klieger was awarded the FIBA Order of Merit. In 2012 he was awarded the National Order of the Legion of Honor by the French President Nicolas Sarkozy upon the recommendation of the journal L‚Äô√âquipe, and in 2015 was inducted into the inducted into the FIBA Hall of Fame as a contributor. Klieger was a recipient of 'L'oeuvre d'une Vie' award from the Journalist's Union and Award for Outstanding and Long-time Sport Activities in Israel (2008), as well as the honorary doctorate by the University of Haifa (2015). He was a recipient of an honorary medal from the City of Strasbourg. In 2016 Klieger was awarded a title of Honorary Freeman by the city of Ramat Gan. His story of survival in the concentration camps has been told in a documentary film Boxing for Life.  Death  Klieger died on December 13, 2018, after several years of ill health caused by a heart condition. His final column for Yedioth Ahronoth was published on December 11 and commemorated 80 years of that newspaper.

Her paternal grandmother was Cornelia Adair, the American born matriarch of Glenveagh Castle in County Donegal, Ireland who was married to John George Adair, a Scottish-Irish businessman and landowner.  Career  Keiller's golf career began in the 1930s under the surname of her second husband, Style. She won the 1948 Ladies' Open Championships in Luxembourg, Switzerland and Monaco, and again in Monaco in 1949. In 1951 she was a finalist in the English Ladies Golf Championship. As an art patron, Keiller focused upon 20th-century avant-garde art. She became interested following a 1960 visit to the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice, and through exposure to the work of Eduardo Paolozzi at the 1960 Venice Biennale. Keiller developed her collection of Dada and Surrealist art with the advice of Roland Penrose. Her bequest to the Scottish National Gallery comprised over 170 artworks (including paintings, sculptures, prints and drawings) in addition to a library of manuscripts, rare books, and journals. The collection was exhibited there anonymously in 1988. In 1996, the collection was enhanced by 26 works from the collection of Penrose. Keillor became a patron of both Paolozzi and Richard Long. She also commissioned Andy Warhol to make a portrait of her dachshund Maurice. Beginning in the 1950s, Keiller became involved with several arts institutions. From 1956 to approximately 1970, Keiller assisted Rupert Bruce-Mitford in a study of the burial ship Sutton Hoo, taking photographs of the site. She volunteered at the Tate from 1976 to 1987, where she was known as the \\"Marmalade Queen\\". From 1978 to 1985, she was a member of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art advisory committee.  Personal life  Keiller's second husband was Charles R. Style, a brewery manager. They divorced in 1950. In 1951, she married her third husband, Alexander Keiller, archaeologist and family heir of Keiller marmalade makers in Dundee.

Written during the reign of Mubarak Shah, his work is an important source of information for the Sayyid dynasty.  Tarikh-i-Mubarak Shahi  Yahya expected to become a courtier of Mubarak Shah (r. 1431-1434), a ruler of the Delhi Sultanate. Therefore, he wrote Tarikh-i-Mubarak Shahi and presented it to the Sultan, hoping to win the royal patronage. The book begins with the conquests of Muhammad of Ghor (1149-1206), and ends abruptly in 1434. Several earlier royal chroniclers had written texts describing the 13th-15th century history of the Delhi Sultanate. For example, Minhaj-i-Siraj covered the period up to 1259 in his Tabaqat-i Nasiri, Ziauddin Barani covered 1259-1356, and Shams-i Siraj Afif covered 1356-1388. Yahya carried forward this chronology all the way to 1434. For the events up to 1351, Yahya selectively borrowed from the earlier writers, and arranged the material in a chronological order. For the events after 1351, he relied on personal memory and observations, besides the accounts of some trustworthy narrators. His work is a regional history, generally limited to military and political events. For example, Yahya omitted the economic reforms of Alauddin Khalji (r. 1296-1316).

The genre fuses characteristics of hip hop music, such as beats and rapping, with the lyrical themes and vocals commonly found in emo music. The genre also takes influence from genres of rock such as indie rock, pop punk and nu metal as well as hip hop elements from trap music, cloud rap and alternative hip hop. The term is sometimes conflated with \\"SoundCloud rap\\".  Characteristics  Emo rapper Lil Peep. Emo rap departs from the \\"traditional\\" tones found in modern mainstream hip hop in favor of more emotional and personal lyrical content, described by the Wall Street Journal as \\"giving their elders the finger.\\" Lyrics tend to focus on topics such as depression, loneliness, anxiety, drug abuse, nihilism, suicide, heartbreak, and self-medication. The genre is characterized by its combination of musical elements commonly found in conscious hip hop with indie rock instrumentals. Horse Head of the collective GothBoiClique has described the music as \\"...sort of nostalgic, but it's new too...no one's really done shit like this. It's like emo rap and melodic trap\\". Fans and artist of the genre along with the scene that surrounds it are often referred to as \\"sad boys\\", in reference to emo rapper Yung Lean's music group by the same name. Emo hip hop beats generally incorporate real instruments. Sampling often utilizes 2000s pop punk and emo songs, a fusion first popularized by MC Lars in 2004. Much of the sampling has been influenced by artists who inspired the genre, such as American Football and Brand New, and is usually accompanied by original instrumentals. History 2000s: Precursors Despite emo hip hop being widely considered a new phenomenon, the usage of the term and hip hop containing lyrics associated with emo music dates back to over as much as 10 years with artists such as Gym Class Heroes, Hollywood Undead, and Eminem. Additionally, rappers such as Joe Budden, and Kanye West, have occasionally been labeled as emo hip hop due to their emotional lyrics as well as minor similarities with the genre, despite their music predating the movement. However, the use of this term did not yet refer to the genre, as the term \\"emo hip hop\\" was used to describe hip hop music with these characteristics in general. The term \\"emo rap\\" was originally coined by Slug of Atmosphere in 1997. Kid Cudi is widely considered one of the largest influences on emo hip hop with his lyrics discussing issues such as depression, loneliness, and anxiety in 2009 with his album Man on the Moon: The End of Day. Cudi later released Speedin' Bullet 2 Heaven, an alternative rock album that was criticized for its messy and uncoordinated style alongside nihilistic lyrics, though he himself labeled it as \\"the most important album in existence\\" saying \\"in 5 years, you'll see its impact\\" ‚Äì referring to Cudi's attempt to innovate beyond hip-hop's typical boundaries. Publications such as HotNewHipHop, DJBooth and IBTimes have all noted Cudi's influence on contemporary hip hop since his breakthrough in 2008, and have attributed both Man on the Moon and Speedin' Bullet 2 Heaven as being major influences on emo hip-hop. Prior to the release of Man on the Moon: The End of the Day, Cudi co-wrote several songs on Kanye West's 808s & Heartbreak, which, along with Drake's So Far Gone, is seen as a seminal influence on the genre. Drake has also influenced emo hip hop through his use of instruments and lyrics in his previous ventures.Sources:  Drake's earliest projects such as Take Care and So Far Gone have been labelled as \\"emo\\", though this was used to describe his music, rather than to imply the projects were within the genre of emo hip hop. German rapper Casper, who fuses hardcore, punk rock and emo with hip hop, was one of the earliest artists to use the term \\"emo rapper\\" to describe themselves (albeit the term was applied to him prior and he simply accepted it), as is evident by a 2009 interview.  2010s: Popularity and deaths  Emo rapper XXXTentacion. With the popularity of rappers such as Lil Peep and XXXTentacion, other hip-hop subgenres that were fueled by the internet, such as cloud rap were labeled as \\"sad rap\\" and included artists such as Yung Lean, who have influenced emo hip hop through their lyrics and their difference to mainstream hip-hop. In 2012, Elmo Kennedy O'Connor ‚Äì then known professionally as Th@ Kid ‚Äì changed his stage-name to Bones and gained popularity online for moving away from cloud rap and blending different styles to create unique forms of music which included the sampling of emo bands, metal music and indie rock. Bones' influence on hip hop in the underground has led to him being considered one of main pioneers of emo rap, as well as being labeled the \\"underground rap king.\\" Artists like Lil Peep, Ghostemane and Yung Bruh (now known as Lil Tracy) with influences from pop punk, emo and screamo began to appear on YouTube and SoundCloud in 2014 and 2015. A sample of XXXTentacion's song \\"Sad!\\", from his 2018 album ?. The song topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Artists in this movement generally stayed on the audio distribution site SoundCloud, and made a large impact on the movement known as \\"SoundCloud rap\\" until Lil Uzi Vert's \\"XO Tour Llif3\\" became a sleeper hit. The song, characterized as emo hip hop due to its lyrics referring to suicide and emotional breakdowns peaked at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100. In August 2017, XXXTentacion released his debut album 17 with the lead single \\"Jocelyn Flores\\" which addresses the suicide of a friend and Lil Uzi Vert released his debut studio album Luv Is Rage 2. The release of both the projects and their high peak on the Billboard 200 led to people defining the projects as \\"emo hip hop\\" and further speculation on whether emo hip hop was a legitimate subgenre and a part of the emo revival, with figureheads such as Lil Peep claiming that emo hip hop was not a part of the emo revival, but a subgenre of its own. At the same time, Lil Peep was branded the \\"future of emo\\" in January 2017 and fronted as a pioneer of the emo revival by The Guardian. In November 2017, Lil Peep died of a Fentanyl overdose. Shortly afterwards, Lil Peep's debut studio album Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 1 and the lead single \\"Awful Things\\" charted on the Billboard charts. His death also brought emo hip hop to the forefront again due to his popularity within the subgenre and the changing hip-hop mainstream. In June 2018, XXXTentacion was murdered, and like Peep, his albums 17 and ? charted the following week, along with his hit song \\"SAD!\\" charting at 1st on the Billboard Hot 100.  Emo rap was the fastest-growing genre on Spotify in 2018.https://www.altpress.com/news/spotify-emo-rap-2018-most-growing-genre/ In December 2019, Juice WRLD died after suffering a seizure, induced by an overdose of oxycodone and codeine. Most known for the songs \\"All Girls Are the Same\\" and \\"Lucid Dreams\\", the latter peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2018., and returned to the chart in 2019 at number eight following his death.

The resulting heat melts the workpieces, and they become welded when the vibration stops and the interface cools. Most machinery operates at 120 Hz, although equipment is available that runs between 100‚Äì240 Hz. Vibration can be achieved either through linear vibration welding, which uses a one dimensional back and forth motion, or orbital vibration welding which moves the pieces in small orbits relative to each other. Linear vibration welding is more common due to simpler and relatively cheaper machinery required. Vibration welding is often used for larger applications where the parts to be joined have relatively flat seams, although the process can accommodate some out of plane curvature. Recently, the automotive industry has made extensive use of the process to produce parts like manifolds and lighting assemblies whose complex geometries prevent single component molding processes.  Advantages and disadvantages Vibration welding has numerous advantages over other conventional plastic welding processes. Since the heat is created at an interface, the molten polymers are not exposed to open air, preventing oxidation and contamination of the weld during the process. No filler material is required, and when welding components of the same material the joint can be expected to be just as strong as the bulk material. Heating is localized to the interface, decreasing the chances of material degradation seen with other processes which require a heat source well above the melt temperature of the material. The process itself is cost effective, with no consumables and short cycle times. Vibration welding produces virtually no smoke or fume, requires little surface preparation, and works well for a multitude of applications, making it well suited to mass production environments. Vibration welding does have its drawbacks, however. The process does not lend itself well to low modulus thermoplastics or to joints between plastics with relatively high differences in melting temperatures. Vibration welding requires part specific fixturing and joint designs, and the part will be exposed to rigorous vibration during the welding cycle which may damage sensitive or miniature components. The finished weld will be surrounded by a significant amount of flash, which must be removed if appearance is an issue. Alternatively, joint geometries which hide the excess flash can be used. Lastly, the process is not well suited to welding of anything other than relatively flat joints.  Vibration welding process The vibration welding process consists of four steps: solid friction, transient flow, steady state flow, and solidification.  Solid friction  In this first stage, vibration is commenced between two cold parts pressed together at a constant pressure. The frictional energy causes the polymers to heat. In this stage there is no weld penetration as melting has not yet occurred.  Transient flow  In the transient flow step the polymer's surface begins to melt. The melt layer thickness quickly grows, causing the frictional forces to decrease. This decrease in friction decreases the heat input to the system, and a lateral flow of molten material begins to occur.  Steady state flow In this phase the melting rate of the material matches the flow of material extruded at the lateral surfaces. The material flow and thickness of the melt layer become constant. This is the step that determines the quality of the weld. This step is maintained until the desired ‚Äòmelt down‚Äô thickness (thickness of the molten material) is achieved. At that time the vibration is stopped and the weld is allowed to cool.  Solidification  During solidification the vibration is stopped, while pressure is maintained on the workpieces until no more molten material remains. Once cooled to room temperature, the joint should have near the strength of the bulk material. Pressure is only relieved once the joint reaches an acceptable strength.  Equipment  A vibration welding machine is in essentially a vertical machine press in which one side has been modified to vibrate. The main components are the vibrating assembly, a lifting table, and a tooling fixture.  Vibrating assembly The vibrating assembly is a moving element driven either by hydraulics or more commonly, electromagnets. In the electromagnetic version, the heart of this assembly is a tuned spring-mass system powered by electrical coils acting on oppositely charged lamination stacks. The frequency of the electrical charges is matched to the mechanical frequency of the system. Although the amplitude can be adjusted on the machine the frequency can only be changed by changing the mass of the vibrating assembly. The moving portion of the tooling is affixed to the vibrating assembly.  Lifting table The lifting table is a hydraulic assembly attached to the fixed portion of the tooling. The lifting table brings the workpieces together, and applies pressure between the moving and stationary portions of the tooling.  Tooling  Tooling refers to the fixtures which are attached to the vibrating assembly and lifting table that hold the work pieces in place. Tooling is application specific, and must allow for workpieces to be quickly switched out after every welding cycle. It is imperative that the tooling matches the workpieces closely enough to prevent any relative motion between the tooling and the workpieces, as this would reduce the amplitude of the weld and lower heat input as well as dimensional tolerances.  Process variables The vibration welding process has five main variables: frequency, amplitude, pressure, time, and depth.  Frequency  Frequency refers to how many times per second a vibration cycle is completed. Most machinery runs at 120 Hz, although machinery is available that runs from 100‚Äì240 Hz. Frequency is dependent on the mass of the vibrating assembly, and as such can only be changed by switching out components of the assembly.  Amplitude Amplitude refers to the distance traveled during each vibratory cycle. Higher amplitudes tend to be used with lower frequencies, and vice versa. Higher amplitudes increase heat input at the cost of cleanliness and dimensional tolerances, making them more useful for larger parts. Lower amplitudes range from 0.7-1.8mm, while higher amplitudes describe cycles that cover 2-4mm.  Pressure Pressure is the primary controller of melt layer thickness, and must be kept within an optimal range in order to produce quality joints. Although pressure can vary between 0.5-20MPa across different materials and geometries, the tolerances for a given application are quite tight. Too little pressure will prevent sufficient heat generation, while too much pressure can cause all of the molten material to squeeze out of the joint. Both scenarios will result in a weak weld. Pressure is controlled by the lifting table.  Time  The length of time that vibration is applied to the workpiece is another key factor. Time is directly proportional to heat generation and material loss to flash. Processes can be either time or depth controlled, with most modern processes being depth controlled. A depth controlled process will have a variable time, and vice versa.  Depth  An illustration of a joint with incorporated flash trap Depth refers to the distance traveled by the workpieces after vibration is started. Sometimes referred to as displacement, it is directly related to the amount of material loss to flash. In general depth should be kept close to or above the thickness of the melt layer at the beginning of the steady state stage. After this value, more depth only results in loss of material without an accompanying rise in joint strength.  Weld design  Weld design for vibration welding must include a relatively large flat surface, although some out of plane curvature can be accommodated for. The most common type of joint is a butt joint, where two flat pieces with the same cross section are welded together. Variations on this joint can include u-flanges, tongue and groove joints, and even double tongue and groove joints. When appearances are important, flash traps can be used. Flash traps refer to hollow areas in the cross section next to the weld area that collect the flash and hide it from view.

Additionally it offers an end-to-end encrypted chat and cloud storage system, called Keybase Chat and the Keybase Filesystem respectively. Files placed in the public portion of the filesystem are served from a public endpoint, as well as locally from a filesystem mounted by the Keybase client. Keybase supports publicly connecting Twitter, GitHub, Reddit, Hacker News and Mastodon identities, including websites and domains under one's control, to encryption keys. It also supports Bitcoin, Zcash, and Stellar wallet addresses. Keybase has supported Coinbase identities since initial public release, but ceased to do so on when Coinbase terminated public payment pages. In general, Keybase allows for any service with public identities to integrate with Keybase. On May 7, 2020, Keybase announced it had been acquired by Zoom, as part of Zoom's \\"plan to further strengthen the security of our video communications platform\\".  Identity proofs  Keybase allows users to prove a link between certain online identities (such as a Twitter or Reddit account) and their encryption keys. Instead of using a system such as OAuth, identities are proven by posting a signed statement as the account a user wishes to prove ownership of. This makes identity proofs publicly verifiable ‚Äì instead of having to trust that the service is being truthful, a user can find and check the relevant proof statements themselves, and the Keybase client does this automatically.  App  In addition to the web interface, Keybase offers a client application for Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, and most desktop Linux distributions, written in Go with an Electron front end. The app offers additional features to the website, such as the end-to-end encrypted chat, teams feature, and the ability to add files to and access private files in their personal and team Keybase Filesystem storage. Each device running the client app is authorized by a signature made either by another device or the user's PGP key. Each device is also given a per-device NaCl (pronounced \\"salt\\") key to perform cryptographic operations.  Chat  Keybase Chat is an end-to-end encrypted chat built in to Keybase launched in February 2017. A distinguishing feature of Keybase Chat is that it allows Keybase users to send messages to someone using their online aliases (for example a reddit account), even if they haven't signed up to Keybase yet. If the recipient (the online alias owner) has an account on Keybase, they will seamlessly receive the message. If the recipient doesn't have a Keybase account, and later signs up and proves the link between the online account and their devices, the sender's device will rekey the message for the recipient based on the public proof they posted, allowing them to read the message. Since the Keybase app checks the proof, it avoids trust on first use.  Keybase Filesystem (KBFS)  Keybase allows users to store up to 250 GB of files in a cloud storage called the Keybase Filesystem for free. There are no storage upgrades available, but paid plans allowing for more data are planned. The filesystem is divided into three parts: public files, private files, and team files. On Unix-like machines, the filesystem is mounted to \`/keybase\`, and on Microsoft Windows systems it is usually mounted to the K drive. Currently, mobile versions of the Keybase client can only download files from kbfs, and can not mount it. However, they do support operations such as rekeying files as necessary. In October 2017 Keybase brought out end-to-end encrypted Git repositories.  Public files  Public files are stored in \`/public/username\`, and are publicly visible. All files in the public filesystem are automatically signed by the client. Only the user who the folder is named after can edit its contents, however, a folder may be named after a list of comma-separated users (e.g. a folder \`/public/foo,bar,three\` would be editable by the users foo, bar, and three). Public files can be accessed by any user. Single user folders are displayed at and are also accessible by opening the directory in the mounted version of the filesystem. Multi user folders (such as \`/public/foo,bar,three\`) are only accessible through the mounted version of the system.  Private files  Private files are stored in \`/private/username\`, and are only visible to username. Private folders, like public folders, can be named after more than one user (e.g. a folder \`/private/foo,bar,three\` would be readable and editable by the users foo, bar, and three). Private files can also be read only for users after \\"#\\" (e.g. a folder \`/private/writer1,writer2,#reader1,reader2\` would be readable and editable by the users writer1 and writer2 but only readable for reader1 and reader2). Unlike public files, all private files are both encrypted and signed before being uploaded, making them end-to-end encrypted.  Team files  Team files are stored in \`/team/teamname\`, and are publicly visible to team members. All files in the team filesystem are automatically encrypted and signed by the client. Only users who are marked as writers can edit its contents, however, any readers can access the files stored there.  Teams  In September 2017, Keybase launched Keybase Teams. A team is described as \\"...a named group of people.\\" Each team has a private folder in the Keybase filesystem, and a number of chat channels (similar to Slack). Teams can also be divided into \\"subteams\\" by placing a \`.\` in the team name. For example, \`wikipedia.projects\` would be a subteam of \`wikipedia\`, while \`wikipedia.projects.foobar\` would be a subteam of \`wikipedia.projects\` (and therefore, also of \`wikipedia\`).  Team administration  Teams are largely administered by adding signatures to a chain. Each signature can add, remove, or change the membership of a user in a team, as well as when changes are made to subteams. Each chain starts with a signature made by the team owner, with subsequent actions signed on by team admins or users. This ensures that every action is made by an authorized user, and that actions can be verified by anyone in possession of the public key used.

Michael Norton (born 1951) is an American artist based in New York City. Since the early 2000s, Norton has been best known for his large-scale abstractions on raw linen. He is represented by UNIX Gallery in New York. Born in North Dakota in 1951, C. Michael Norton studied Fine Art at Humboldt State University and San Jose State University in California. After working first as a sculptor, Norton turned to painting as his predominant medium by the late 1980s. Given the artist‚Äôs education and background as a sculptor, his paintings are notable for the wide variety of tools, not including the traditional paintbrush, utilized in their production (for instance, mud knives, rollers and squeegees). Norton‚Äôs recent paintings often evolve from random markings collected by pieces of linen that are taped to the floor while other works are in progress, which are then intuitively built upon. He was awarded exhibition and residency grants from the Ministry of Culture, Paris, France, Commission d‚Äôorientation des arts plastique, Grenoble, France in 1984. From 1984 to 1992 Norton lived, worked and exhibited in France, Germany, Italy, and New York. Norton‚Äôs work has been exhibited at institutions including the Sunshine International Museum and the Fifth Beijing International Biennale at the National Art Museum of China, Beijing; Albissola/ America/Arte‚Äù Museo Civico d‚ÄôArte Contemporanea, Albissola, Italy, the Torrance Museum of Art, Torrance, California, the San Francisco Museum of Art, San Francisco, California. It has been reviewed by prominent art publications including Art in America, which called Norton's paintings \\"architecturally structured, with an allover interplay between hard-edged forms and flat yet infinite space indicated by areas of raw canvas,\\", ARTnews, and Artcritical,Artcritical. and he has received critical acclaim from Eleanor Heartney, Raphael Rubinstein, Stephen Westfall, Richard Vine and David Cohen, among others.

The combination is responsible for organising clubs and cup competitions in the city of Gloucester and surrounding area, but is ultimately part of the Gloucestershire Rugby Football Union, which has overall control over rugby union in the county. Although there is no senior men's team (they are only eligible for the Gloucestershire county side), there are North Combination junior sides (under-16), as well as a vets team.  History  Although the North Gloucestershire Combination was not officially formed until early in the 20th century, rugby union was already popular in the region with Gloucester Rugby having come into existence in 1873. Gloucester were then, as now, the biggest club in the county, but still needed the support of junior club sides to bolster their team in the case of injuries and other such selection crisis's. A solution of sorts was to introduce a competition for local club sides to help develop rugby union in the city and increase the amount and quality of potential players that could one day represent Gloucester. The first cup competition was introduced in 1893‚Äì94 and was known simply as the 'Challenge Cup'. Early records of this Challenge Cup are scarce but it the early competition format appears to be that of a league, with the teams taking part considered part of the Gloucester League, even though sides from other towns such as Stroud and Cheltenham took part. Of the first clubs to take part in the new competition, only Gordon League and Painswick are still members of the North Gloucestershire Combination, although other club sides such as Stroud are still active, albeit in neighbouring combinations. During the 1903‚Äì04 season the Senior Cup was introduced for the first time, with the inaugural winners being Berkley. During this period the local junior clubs were becoming disillusioned by the competition as it was not particularly well organised, results were not recorded properly and Gloucester Rugby were seen to be the beneficiaries to the detriment of the smaller clubs, who felt they were not been looked after properly. This would ultimately lead to the Gloucestershire RFU having to step in. In 1912 the Gloucester & District Combination was formed, containing 10 clubs including Gordon League and Painswick. A year later the name was changed to the North Gloucestershire Combination due to the involvement of sides from nearby towns such Cheltenham and Stroud. During the 1913‚Äì14 season a second cup competition known as the Junior Cup was introduced for A sides and was won by St Marks. While several clubs would leave to join neighbouring combinations such as Cheltenham & District and Stroud & District in the period between and following the World Wars, the North Gloucestershire Combination would grow in size, with sides such Spartans (1927), Old Centralians (1937), Coney Hill (1947) and Matson (1957) coming into existence. Many of the clubs had enough players to field multiple teams and by the 1974‚Äì75 season a third cup competition known as the Glanville Cup was introduced for third teams, named after the competition's sponsor, Brian Glanville of Glanville Tires. Despite the game becoming professional in the 1980s and league rugby becoming increasingly important as the game approached the 21st century, the North Gloucestershire Combination cup competitions have proven to be popular with local teams, the prospect of a final at Kingsholm Stadium still being a big incentive. Affiliated clubs There are currently 17 clubs affiliated with the North Gloucestershire Combination, with teams at both senior and junior level. This clubs are also affiliated with the Gloucestershire RFU. Note that although Gloucester Rugby are a member of the combination they do not actually take part in any of the competitions, as they operate at too high a level. They do however, enable their home ground of Kingsholm to be used for the combination cup finals. *Brockworth *Chosen Hill Former Pupils *Coney Hill *Dowty *Gloucester All Blues *Gloucester Old Boys *Gloucester Rugby *Gordon League *Hardwicke & Quedgeley Harlequins *Hucclecote *Longlevens *Matson *Old Centralians *Old Cryptians *Old Richians *Spartans *Widden Old Boys  Combination club competitions  The North Gloucestershire Combination currently runs the following club competitions: Cups *North Gloucestershire Senior Cup ‚Äì founded in 1903 for club sides based in Gloucester between tiers 5‚Äì11 *North Gloucestershire Junior Cup ‚Äì founded in 1913 for 2nd teams *North Gloucestershire Glanville Cup ‚Äì founded in 1975 for 3rd teams  See also  * Gloucestershire RFU * Bristol Combination * English rugby union system * History of the English rugby union system  References   External links  *North Gloucestershire Combination website Rugby union governing bodies in England 1913 establishments in England Sport in Gloucester Rugby union in Gloucestershire ","title":"North Gloucestershire Combination"},{"id":"55315689","text":"F√©nelon - La Trinit√© School is a middle and secondary school in the Jesuit tradition, in Lyon, France.

He is best known for having been controversially arrested in Hall County, Georgia after publicly declaring his religious opposition against the public education system in 2014. His conviction in that matter was ultimately overturned by the Supreme Court of Georgia.http://www.gasupreme.us/wp- content/uploads/2017/10/s17a1040.pdf Early life and career Freeman was born in Gwinnett County Georgia and attended public schools. He entered the University of Georgia as a music education major where he studied from 2005-2009 before becoming disillusioned with the state of public education. For some time thereafter Freeman served as a music minister and in a variety of ministry capacities until his arrest in 2014. He also married and had children, whom he homeschooled.Trial Transcript, State of Georgia v. Freeman (2014-SR-5623-Z)http://www.gasupreme.us/wp- content/uploads/2017/05/may15_2017_OA.pdf In 2016, Freeman became a founding Elder at eastjordan.church, where he currently serves on a volunteer basis as a web developer. Political advocacy Freeman first entered the political world as a precinct chairman in the Hall County Republican Party in 2012, and that year served as a delegate for Hall County to the Georgia Republican Party's State Convention, where he was noted for arguing in favor of strict constitutional construction regarding a party resolution on the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012. The next year, Freeman was voted in as chairman for the Georgia Ninth District of the Republican Liberty Caucus and was recognized at the 2013 state convention for his arguments that the state party should abide very strictly by its established rules. Freeman also took up a leadership role in the Lanier Tea Party Patriots, where he twice served as a master of ceremonies for their annual tax-day rally. Freeman poses with his family as MC for the Tea Party Tax Day Rally in April, 2014. Disagreement with sheriff In April 2013, Freeman publicly came into conflict with Hall County Sheriff Gerald Couch concerning the constitutionality of federal laws which Freeman perceived to overstep the bounds of the 2nd Amendment to the US Constitution, and in the following months filed numerous complaints to the Sheriff regarding Sheriff's deputies speeding in patrol cars during non-emergencies, sometimes under particularly dangerous conditions (on icy roads, in school zones, and at very high speeds). 12Stone Church controversy On August 3, 2014, Freeman attended services with his family at 12Stone Church in Flowery Branch, Georgia, where he served as a volunteer minister to youths. On that day, Jason Berry (then pastor at that campus), displayed video of a Staples commercial which portrayed children as being particularly depressed about returning to school, and offered prayers for local public school teachers. At trial and in his appeals, Freeman contended that he was displeased with the display because of youth in the church who had expressed suicidal thoughts in the lead-up to the new school year. In response, Freeman (who was positioned in the back of the sanctuary about 50 yards away from Berry) raised his middle finger to Berry. At trial, Freeman stated that it was his intention to object without disrupting the service, saying \\"I believe that I would have been failing in my duty as a minister to the church and God if I had not confronted Jason for what he said, and I believe that I did so in the most appropriate way possible.\\" Thereafter, when the church service had ended, Freeman stood and addressed the crowd saying, \\"It is your responsibility to raise your own children, and it is a sin to give them to a godless government.\\" Arrest, detention, and trial On the day of the incident, a warrant was issued for Freeman's arrest for \\"Disrupting a Public Gathering.\\" This warrant was invalid, because Georgia's \\"Disrupting a Public Gathering\\" law had been declared unconstitutional in 2006. According to testimony by multiple witnesses at Freeman's trial, Freeman was arrested at his home by a SWAT team armed with semiautomatic weapons and accompanied by a K9 unit. At trial, the state denied that a SWAT team had been at Freeman's home, but the arresting officer on record, Mike Lusk, had been identified previously in the Gainesville Times as a member of the Hall County SWAT team. Freeman later claimed in a lawsuit against the Hall County Sheriff Gerald Couch that after his arrest he was held nude in solitary confinement, threatened with death, and denied bedding and basic hygienic items (among other abuses) during a three-day stay at the Hall County Detention Center. Two of the officers most closely tied to Freeman's arrest left the Sheriff's office in disgrace shortly thereafter. Jacob Haney, the Sergeant on duty at the time of Freeman's arrest, resigned after he was caught having an on-duty affair with a Flowery Branch policewoman. Mike Lusk, the officer who arrested Freeman, was himself arrested for an unrelated \\"Invasion of Privacy\\" charge on May 22, 2015 after a GBI investigation and was released on a $10,000 bond. In May 2015, charges against Freeman for \\"Obstruction\\" and \\"Disrupting a Public Gathering\\" were dismissed by Hall County State Court Judge Larry Baldwin, and the state replaced these with a charge of \\"Disorderly Conduct,\\" with the state alleging that holding up a middle finger and shouting a political opinion in public represented a credible threat to life, limb, and health. Freeman was tried and convicted by a jury on January 11‚Äì12, 2016. Appeals and argument before Supreme Court On January 18, 2017, Freeman's appeal was transferred by the Georgia Court of Appeals to the Georgia Supreme Court on the grounds that his free speech arguments raised a constitutional question over which the Court of Appeals could not have jurisdiction. Oral arguments in the case were held at the Georgia Supreme Court on May 15, 2017, with Freeman representing himself, and Daniel SanMiguel representing Hall County. Arguments before the court focused primarily on whether Georgia's disorderly conduct statute (16-11-39(a)(1)), is unconstitutionally broad, whether or not people have a constitutionally protected right to shout in a public place, and on whether or not Freeman's conduct - standing, giving a middle finger from 50 yards away, and shouting a religious message - could possibly have violated the statute by representing a reasonable threat of harm. The statute in question reads: \\"A person commits the offense of disorderly conduct when such person commits any of the following: Acts in a violent or tumultuous manner toward another person whereby such person is placed in reasonable fear of the safety of such person's life, limb, or health;\\"https://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/gacode/ Freeman argued that the words \\"tumultuous\\" and \\"reasonable\\" are not clearly defined in the law and leave intelligent people to guess about their meaning. Freeman also argued that the first amendment protects ministers to speak controversial messages in their churches. SanMiguel argued that while none of Freeman's actions constituted obscenity or represented a reasonable threat in themselves, the actions taken as a whole represented disorderly conduct in their totality. On October 2, 2017, the Supreme Court of Georgia reversed Freeman's disorderly conduct conviction on the grounds that his conduct could not have possibly violated Georgia's disorderly conduct statute, and that the middle finger is protected speech. At the time that the conviction was overturned, Freeman stated that he was working mowing lawns as a result of his false conviction, despite the fact that he is skilled in computer programming. Lawsuit against Hall County sheriff In August 2016, Freeman filed a suit in the Georgia Northern District court against Hall County Sheriff Gerald Couch and other employees of the Sheriff's Office, alleging that he had been subjected to abuses during his arrest and stay at the Hall County jail. Federal Judge Richard W. Story ultimately dismissed the suit without a hearing, stating that \\"neither a State nor its officials acting in their official capacities are 'persons'... On the contrary, states and their officials, acting in official capacities, are immune from suit.\\" Freeman's Reaction to the Supreme Court Ruling Since the Supreme Court's decision, Freeman has been blogging about the experience. In his blog, Freeman has claimed that he was sexually abused and tortured for his faith while he was held at the Hall County Detention Center, and has also claimed (providing an audio recording from a possible witness) that the police attempted to assassinate him while he was awaiting trial, forcing his family to flee from the state and live in hiding for several years. Freeman has also relayed additional stories of interactions with police and the courts since his arrest, which he claims represent a pattern of intentional abuse against him, ostensibly for his conservative Christian views and advocacy against abuses of power by police.

During the 1970s and 1980s he served in state government under Republican governors William T. Cahill and Thomas Kean. As the state's Transportation Commissioner during the latter governor's administration, he oversaw the transfer of commuter rail service in the state from Conrail to New Jersey Transit. At the time of his death, he was president and chief executive officer of Cooper Health System, which has since named one of its buildings after him. His death has been a matter of some controversy. Firefighters responding to a fire at his Skillman home in the early morning found Sheridan and his wife Joyce dead in an upstairs room. Both bodies had been stabbed multiple times; an autopsy found John Sheridan had been alive after the fire started. After a lengthy investigation the Somerset County prosecutor ruled that John Sheridan had killed his wife and then himself, setting the fire to make it appear they had died that way. Sheridan's four sons, the oldest of whom had followed his father's political footsteps and served as chief counsel to the New Jersey Republican Party, vigorously disputed the finding. Not only had their parents not shown any sign that they might do something like this, there were anomalies in the evidence, as well as deficiencies in the investigation. After a court challenge they brought, in 2017 the state's chief medical examiner overruled the prosecutor and said that while John Sheridan's proximate cause of death was the combined effect of the stab wounds he suffered and smoke inhalation, it could not be determined if he had stabbed himself or not. Early life John P. Sheridan Jr. was born September 7, 1942, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Rita and John P. Sheridan. The family moved to Northern New Jersey in childhood, and John Jr. eventually graduated from Seton Hall Preparatory School, then in South Orange. From there he went on to attend St. Peter's College (now Saint Peter's University) in Jersey City, and then Rutgers Law School. He met Joyce Mitchko, of Lincoln Park, New Jersey, three years his junior, while he was tending bar in West Orange to pay for a law school. The two married in 1967. Over the next decade they would have four children, all sons: twins Mark and Matthew, Daniel and Timothy. Joyce taught social studies in the Cedar Grove and South Brunswick public schools. His younger brother, Peter G. Sheridan, went to St. Peter's as well, and is currently a federal judge sitting on the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. Career After law school he served in the Army for two years. Following his discharge, he went to work in the administration of Republican New Jersey Governor William T. Cahill as a deputy attorney general and, later, assistant counsel to Cahill. Later in the decade, after Cahill's two terms had ended and Democrat Brendan Byrne was elected governor, he would serve as counsel to the Republicans, then the minority party, in the State Senate. Outside of government, he ran the Trenton office of the Morristown law firm Riker, Danzig, Scherer, Hyland & Perretti, lobbying state government on behalf of the firm's clients. Sheridan had also served as counsel to the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. This experience led to his appointment as the state's Transportation Commissioner when Republicans returned to control of the state's executive branch with the 1981 election of Thomas Kean as governor. James Weinstein, who worked for Sheridan in that position and later became Transportation Commissioner himself, recalls that Sheridan got his department's goal accomplished through \\"patient, lawyerly arguments based on public policy and shared interests.\\" In 1982, Congress had mandated that Conrail, the government-created corporation that took over the freight operations of many bankrupt private railways in the Northeast and Midwest, stop providing passenger service, which it had not done well in any event. The commuter rail lines that Conrail had operated in New Jersey, mostly in the New York City metropolitan area but one crossing South Jersey from Atlantic City to Philadelphia, were thus transferred to New Jersey Transit, created three years earlier to take over bus services around the state that private companies could no longer provide. Sheridan completed this takeover by the end of Kean's first term in 1985; he served on NJ Transit's board for several years afterwards. After leaving that position he returned to private law practice. He was not done with politics; in 1993, when Republicans retook the governor's mansion and state legislature, he served on Christine Todd Whitman's transition team. For 25 years he served on the Carrier Clinic's board. In 2005 he left Riker Danzig, where he had become a senior partner and the firm's co-manager, to take over as president and chief executive officer of Cooper University Hospital in Camden. He and the chairman of the hospital's board, George Norcross, a leading Democratic figure in South Jersey, worked together to use their political connections and knowledge to secure favorable rulings from regulators and public financing in support of Cooper's expansion plans. Several years later, this led to the merger with the MD Anderson Cancer Center and the opening of the only four-year medical school in South Jersey, Cooper Medical School of Rowan University. Sheridan did not leave politics completely during his time at Cooper. Shortly after taking the job, he helped his brother Peter G. Sheridan get nominated, and then confirmed, to a judgeship on New Jersey's federal district court. After the 2009 election of another Republican, Chris Christie, to the governorship, he served again on the transition team. Death Shortly before dawn on September 28, 2014, local firefighters responded to a report of flames at the Sheridans' house on Meadow Run Drive in the Skillman section of Montgomery Township, in southwestern Somerset County. Smoke was coming from one area of the second floor that turned out to be the master bedroom. After entering through the unlocked front door, the firefighters went upstairs and easily put out the fire, fueled by gasoline that had been poured on the floor as an accelerant. Also on the floor, they found the bodies of John and Joyce, lying face up. John was pronounced dead at the scene, as was Joyce after her body was taken to University Medical Center of Princeton at Plainsboro. A week later, a memorial service was held for John and Joyce at Patriot's Theater at the Trenton War Memorial. The family was joined by hundreds of mourners, including Christie and his predecessors Kean, Whitman and Democrat Jim Florio. Many of the public officials present praised John Sheridan's career and accomplishments. \\"The city of Camden is a different place because of his vision,\\" George Norcross said. The actual funeral was private. In March 2015, Geoffrey Soriano, the county prosecutor, ruled that their death was a murder- suicide in which John, possibly motivated by despair over an upcoming negative state report on the hospital's cardiac unit, had killed Joyce, then himself, and set the fire to conceal evidence. Mark Sheridan and his brothers strongly disputed that conclusion, and hired Michael Baden to do a second autopsy. He concluded that it was highly likely that a third person killed the two, especially given that the knife which had inflicted the fatal wounds could not be found. While they did not dispute that their father had died of the stab wounds and smoke inhalation, the Sheridan brothers campaigned vigorously to have John Sheridan's manner of death changed to \\"undetermined\\" from suicide, based on Baden's recommendation, and for Soriano to not be reappointed county prosecutor when his term expired. Newspaper reporting about the case revealed extensive problems with the state's medical examiner system in general and how it handled the Sheridans' case in particular. A detective who had investigated the case early on claimed in a suit, later dismissed, against the prosecutor's office that he had been retaliated against after complaining that other detectives mishandled and even threw away key evidence in the case. After Governor Christie appointed a new state medical examiner, Andrew Falzon, in 2016, 200 politically prominent New Jerseyans, including three former governors and two former attorneys general, wrote the new medical examiner an open letter asking that John Sheridan's death certificate be amended as his family wanted. Later in 2016 Christie refused to renew Soriano's appointment, reportedly claiming he had \\"lost confidence\\" in the prosecutor. In 2017 Falzon officially changed John Sheridan's death certificate to say that the manner of death was undetermined. Legacy In May 2017 Cooper named one of its facilities after its late head. Sheridan Pavilion is a five-story ambulatory care facility on the hospital's campus in downtown Camden that treats 100,000 patients a year. Governor Christie, former governors Kean, Florio, Corzine and James McGreevey, along with former acting governor and state senate president Donald DiFrancesco, attended the dedication ceremony.

The show is itself based on the characters created by DC Comics set in the Batman mythology. This is the first episode with the new subtitle \\"A Dark Knight\\". The episode was written by executive producer John Stephens and directed by Danny Cannon. It was first broadcast on September 21, 2017. The episode revolves around a period in which criminals now get \\"licenses\\" to commit crimes without getting arrested by the police, provided by Cobblepot in order to earn the support of the public to reduce crime, setting the city at historical lows. However, a gang of criminals challenge the new licenses' policy and decide to set at their own way, committing many heists to send a message to Cobblepot. The gang also makes use of Jonathan Crane's fear toxin. Gordon discovers the use of the gas and sets to find Jonathan. Meanwhile, Bruce continues his vigilantism in order to prepare himself when Ra's al Ghul arrives. The episode received positive response, who praised the new character development for some characters. Plot Bruce (David Mazouz) saves a couple from a pair of thugs after beating them. Bruce discovers that the thugs possess a license of misconduct. He walks away from the scene, not realizing Ra's al Ghul (Alexander Siddig) is watching him. Elsewhere, a group of gunmen crash a wedding and begin to steal the guests' valuable objects. Zsasz (Anthony Carrigan) arrives, stating that they don't have Cobblepot's (Robin Lord Taylor) license authorization, a deal in which they will be allowed to commit crimes as long as they give half their values to him. Zsasz shoots the leader Merton (Michael Buscemi), cutting his finger and they flee. Meanwhile, Cobblepot manages to convince the newly appointed Mayor Burke (Larry Pine) to agree to his license union. Gordon (Ben McKenzie) arrives at a bar just when a thug is robbing, holding a license. Despite possessing it, Gordon stops the robbery and arrests him. Bruce tells Alfred (Sean Pertwee) his intention to stop Cobblepot's crime business. Merton and his partner Grady (Michael Maize) visit Arkham Asylum to meet with Jonathan Crane (Charlie Tahan), who is still traumatized after suffering the effects of the fear toxin. Throughout time, Jonathan's mind created a \\"Boogeyman person\\" that has been haunting him. Merton and Grady bribe the Warden (Damian Young) to release Jonathan, who leaves a drawing in the form of a scarecrow. They take him to his old home where his father left his experimental drugs. They force him to do more fear gas with the use of a scarecrow. The gang then uses the gas to do a bank heist, spraying the people with the gas in order to make the heist easier. Investigating the heist, Gordon tells Bullock (Donal Logue) that the method is the same as Gerald Crane's and deduces that someone must have taken the formula from Jonathan. After interrogating the Warden, they go to Grady's apartment but are ambushed by him and Merton. Merton explains that they plan to send a message to Cobblepot regarding the licenses and they leave. Meanwhile, Selina (Camren Bicondova) and Tabitha (Jessica Lucas) attack a group of thugs. When returning to their apartment, Zsasz shows up, claiming that they should go to Cobblepot's club inauguration to get their licenses and forget everything between them. Selina is interested but Tabitha refuses and tells her to pack so they can find a new place. Cobblepot gives a conference to inaugurate his new club, the Iceberg Lounge and shows the attendees Nygma's (Cory Michael Smith) frozen body as a hall exhibition. Gordon, using an advice from Bruce, visits him and taunts him that the gang does not fear him, prompting Cobblepot to set to catch the gang. The gang decides to attack the club's inauguration and have Jonathan make more toxins and then lock him in a closet with a scarecrow. He then begins to have a severe hallucination with the scarecrow, who seemingly comes to life. In the GCPD, Gordon is attacked by a group of cops that are loyal to Cobblepot's methods. In the Iceberg Lounge, Bruce finds Selina on the rooftop and they discuss about what happened at the hospital when Bruce says sorry to Selina about apologising, just before Alfred takes him to the inauguration. The gang prepares to attack when Cobblepot and Zsasz catch them and announce to the public their intentions. This disgusts Ivy (Maggie Geha), who cuts the power and the gang attack, spraying Cobblepot with the fear toxin, making him hallucinate Nygma. The gang is knocked out but Grady manages to escape. The next day, Bruce retrieves the list of criminals with the licenses. However, he accidentally slips on a house where it's been robbed. He is then caught without the mask by the GCPD. Grady returns to Crane's house to get more toxin from Jonathan. However, he discovers Jonathan has adopted a new persona, naming himself \\"The Scarecrow\\" and sprays Grady with fear gas. Production Development The show was officially renewed by Fox for a fourth season on May 10, 2017. Just like the second and third seasons, the fourth season will also carry a new subtitle for the first half of the season: A Dark Knight. In June 2017, John Stephens announced that the first episode of the season would be titled \\"Pax Penguina\\" and was to be written by Stephens and directed by Danny Cannon. The title \\"Pax Penguina\\" is a play on the Latin phrase \\"Pax Romana\\", meaning \\"Roman peace\\". Writing Regarding Bruce's beginning of vigilantism, McKenzie explained that \\"We are definitely leaning into Bruce, having learned some of the skills to be a vigilante, now actually attempting it. Now, we have a long, long way to go before he can realistically be Batman, so there will be many stumbles and falls ‚Äì and regressions back to being a kid at times ‚Äì but Gordon will eventually become aware of what he's doing and that will bring them against each other.\\" David Mazouz also added, \\"Bruce really is taking on this vigilante persona and all the things that go along with that. Whether it be creating another persona, a public persona, that's also definitely going to be a major part of Bruce's journey this year. His relationship as this other person. Batman is coming. Absolutely.\\" Mazouz also stated that he was worried the writers could pull back some aspects from Batman, deeming it \\"too fast\\" but he was glad it didn't stop. He said that Bruce would take the \\"Batman persona\\" this season. Cannon also explained that Bruce will be seen \\"as the emerging threat he is.\\" Alexander Siddig stated that his character will seek to make Bruce his heir and will \\"do anything he can to get his hands on him, to manipulate him into what [Ra's] wants him to be.\\" He also claimed that the season is \\"a season so far of extremes.\\" Casting As a concept McKenzie wished to explore, the episode brought back the actor Charlie Tahan as Jonathan Crane / Scarecrow, who portrayed the character on the first-season episodes: \\"The Fearsome Dr. Crane\\" and \\"The Scarecrow\\". McKenzie explained: \\"So we met his father Dr Crane in Season 1. So we've taken our time; we're gonna come back now to his son. You know, in circumstances probably not best described now, his son takes on his father's mantle and becomes the fully- realized Scarecrow. It's great. We're able to use this sort of fear toxin that Scarecrow is able to summon. We're completely unafraid ‚Äî or perhaps afraid but we still persist‚Äìin expanding the universe and our capabilities.\\" Morena Baccarin, Erin Richards, Chris Chalk, Drew Powell and Crystal Reed don't appear in the episode as their respective characters, with Baccarin and Chalk receiving credit only, while Richards, Powell and Reed were uncredited. In August 2017, it was announced that the guest cast for the episode would include Michael Buscemi as Merton, Larry Pine as Mayor Burke, Michael Maize as Grady Harris, Charlie Tahan as Jonathan Crane, Anthony Carrigan as Victor Zsasz, Damian Young as Warden Reed and Maggie Geha as Ivy Pepper. Reception Viewers The episode was watched by 3.21 million viewers with a 1.0/4 share among adults aged 18 to 49. These ratings were higher than any episode of the second part of the past season and it was a 6% increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 3.03 million viewers with a 0.9/4 in the 18-49 demographics but an 18% decrease from the previous season premiere, which was watched by 3.90 million viewers with a 1.3/4 in the 18-49 demographics. With these ratings, Gotham ranked second for the night as well as for Fox behind The Orville. The show was the 49th most watched show of the week. Critical reviews \\"A Dark Knight: Pax Penguina\\" received positive reviews from critics. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"good\\" 7.8 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"Gotham returned with a fun look at how much of the city's problem's could be solved with morally questionable outside-the-box thinking. It's up to the show now to convince me, basically, that Jim has a leg to stand on with regards to his objections of having a staggeringly low crime rate and a city at peace.\\" Nick Hogan of TV Overmind gave the episode a 4 star rating out of 5, writing \\"Ultimately, Gotham is off to an interesting start. The pivot to a different style has its merits, but the long term benefits will have be [sic] fleshed out. Still, I enjoyed the episode immensely, and I'm glad that one of my favorite shows is back.\\" Sydney Bucksbaum of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \\"The potential for chaos and destruction is truly terrifying. Thank goodness Jim Gordon isn't rolling over and letting Penguin run the city. If anyone can find and catch Crane, it's him. And it's interesting to note that this incarnation of the Scarecrow is much closer to the comic book version, despite it being Dr. Jonathan Crane's son and not the professor himself. Gotham is no longer just dealing in proto-villains.\\" Dan Seitz from Uproxx wrote, \\"Embracing the campiness that was always at the core of the show was something of a risk for Gotham. But it's paid off, especially now that the show is full of vigilantes and frozen villains in the middle of nightclubs. As the show's realized it can be, well, Goth ham, it's loosened up and started having fun.\\" Vinnie Mancuso of Collider wrote, \\"Outside of a few rejected album reviews drunkenly sent to every music magazine in the country at 4 AM, I rarely get the chance to compare Fox's batshit Batman prequel Gotham to the music stylings of Taylor Swift. But the show's Season 4 premiere, titled 'Pax Penguina,' provided a surprisingly prescient opportunity to do just that. Much like Swift hinted at her transition from a sugar-laced pop-singer into something angrier and more prone to shop at Hot Topic by declaring the Old Taylor was dead, young Jonathan Crane announced that he, too, has officially become something darker. 'Jonathan Crane isn't here anymore,' he says at the episode's conclusion. 'It's just the Scarecrow.'\\" Lisa Babick of TV Fanatic gave the series a 3.5 star rating out of 5, writing \\"'Pax Penguina' was a bit of a rocky start to the season, but there are good storylines that show promise; Bruce's being the most of exciting of all. Will Baby Batman decide to take on Scarecrow, or will that be Jim's villain to catch? \\" Robert Yanis, Jr. of Screenrant wrote, \\"Seasons 2 and 3 may have introduced some thrilling villain origins, but aside from that, its narrative has felt jumbled and erratic. The show has long been fans' guiltiest pleasure, but Bruce's storyline this season could legitimize Gotham once and for all. For as much fun as Penguin and company are, the real reason fans tune in to a Batman prequel is to see the character's evolution. Now he has arrived: a dark knight.\\" Kayti Burt of Den of Geek wrote, \\"It might seem like I am being a little harsh on this episode, which introduced some great new plot directions for this show, but, after last season, I know this show can do better! It has raised the bar for what makes a great episode of Gotham.\\" Laurence Mozafari of Digital Spy wrote, \\"Gotham season 4 has swooped onto screens, and as itty bitty Bruce Wayne continues his loooong transformation into the Batman, fans were treated to a new, acrobatic look at the young detective.\\" References  External links  Gotham (season 4) episodes 2017 American television episodes ","title":"Pax Penguina"},{"id":"55315818","text":"Pavl√≠na Nepokojov√° (born 29 January 1989) is a Czech football Midfielder, currently playing for Sparta Praha in the Czech First Division.Profile in Sparta's website She is a member of the Czech national team.Profile in UEFA's website References External links 1989 births Living people Czech women's footballers Czech Republic women's international footballers Sportspeople from Hradec Kr√°lov√© Women's association football midfielders Czech expatriate sportspeople in the United States Expatriate women's soccer players in the United States SK Slavia Praha (women) players AC Sparta Praha (women) players Czech First Division (women) players ","title":"Pavl√≠na Nepokojov√°"},{"id":"55315820","text":"Henry Peirse (c. 1754‚Äì1824) was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons for 50 years from 1774 to 1824.

It was first broadcast on September 28, 2017. In the episode, Gordon goes after Jonathan Crane, now calling himself \\"The Scarecrow.\\" Planning to expose his demons, Jonathan makes a mutiny in Arkham Asylum and Gordon, all alone, decides to go and face it himself.

Plot The GCPD arrives at the Crane house to discover the experimentation tests. Gordon (Ben McKenzie) and Bullock (Donal Logue) then discover Grady (Michael Maize) tied, scarily yelling that \\"The Scarecrow\\" is coming. Bruce (David Mazouz) manages to get released from the GCPD, claiming he was on the roof and accidentally falling off in the wrong time. Although suspecting him, Gordon decides to let him go but Fox (Chris Chalk) also suspects about Bruce. In Arkham Asylum, Warden Reed (Damian Young) destroys his evidence when he is visited by Jonathan (Charlie Tahan) in his Scarecrow persona. Jonathan sprays him with fear gas and makes him face his biggest fears. He then sprays the rest of the inmates in the infirmary. Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) arrives at the GCPD and confronts Gordon for not catching Jonathan while also being teased for his ridicule in the club opening. They then a make a deal in which Gordon needs to catch Jonathan within 24 hours, otherwise Cobblepot will clean the city his way. Meanwhile, Selina (Camren Bicondova) and Tabitha (Jessica Lucas) are summoned to a building after they've received a card saying \\"An Opportunity Awaits\\" where they shockingly discover Barbara (Erin Richards) is alive and well.

This is revealed to be just a test to prove her trust and she spares her saying she'll start work on Monday. Gordon arrives at the GCPD and is confronted by Cobblepot, who berates him and even tells the fellow officers to go working for him. Ivy (Maggie Geha) decides to retrieve some potions from a store and interrogates the man with her perfume to give her the combination to the safe. After consuming them, her face begins to mutate. Gordon and Bullock go to a bar where Harvey suggests that they would require an army to take down Cobblepot. Gordon then decides to go and visit Falcone. That night, Bruce begins practicing on his new suit. Production Development In June 2017, it was announced that the second episode of the season would be titled \\"The Fear Reaper\\" and was to be written by Danny Cannon and directed by Louis Shaw Milito. Writing According to Stephens, the episode handles a horror-oriented direction on the season: \\"At the very beginning of the season, Penguin has solidified his control upon Gotham like never before. Where he's kind of unionized crime. And Scarecrow comes in to basically reintroduce fear into Gotham and to remind people that the dark is still scary out there. And we're really going to fashion, especially Episode 2, almost a horror movie episode where we really get to see Scarecrow. I think he's like purely terrifying. Imagine, rather than the other versions of Scarecrow out there ‚Äî because there are a lot of different versions ‚Äî what if you just really tell Scarecrow as a horror movie? Because he could be scary as hell.\\" Executive producer Danny Cannon stated, \\"When the studio asks you to tone back because it's too scary, you know you've done something right!\\" Casting Cory Michael Smith, Drew Powell, Crystal Reed and Alexander Siddig don't appear in the episode as their respective characters, with Smith and Siddig receiving credit only, while Powell and Reed were uncredited. In September 2017, it was announced that the guest cast for the episode would include Michael Maize as Grady Harris,Charlie Tahan as Jonathan Crane, Anthony Carrigan as Victor Zsasz, Damian Young as Warden Reed and Maggie Geha as Ivy Pepper. Reception Viewers The episode was watched by 2.87 million viewers with a 0.9/3 share among adults aged 18 to 49.

Critical reviews \\"A Dark Knight: The Fear Reaper\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"good\\" 7.2 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"While Scarecrow screamed, swung his scythe, and sprayed lunatics with fear toxin, this episode honed in some more on the GCPD's current crisis of conscience. It's an interesting journey to take but also one that smacks of the shows past sins regarding a poorly-manned (and conceived) police force - with Jim Gordon now trying to be the guiding light.\\" Nick Hogan of TV Overmind gave the episode a 3.5 star rating out of 5, writing \\"Overall, I'm still on the fence about Season 4.

The book was adapted from the Greek legend of Helen of Troy and follows the famous woman's life after the burning of Troy. Plot summary In the beginning, Menelaus - Helen's husband - leaves Troy in search of her and plans to kill her for all the trouble her beauty has caused. Instead, the two set out on a week-long voyage back to Sparta. Menelaus questions why his wife ran away from Sparta to begin with, saying that he didn't believe her involvement with Paris was enough. Once at home, Helen talks with Charita and tells her that in the beginning, she thought she loved Paris and that is why she ran away with him, but she realized she only loved something he made her think of, and in the end, she only felt sorry for him. She goes on to say that she felt sorry for Paris because she could see he was \\"lost in the madness\\" just as she was. She tells her that marriage starts with love, but the people in the marriage get lost along the way and calls marriages fatal errors. The book follows Helen's family and how she navigates friendships, her marriage, and parenting her children after what many in her life call, 'the scandal.'  Themes  Helen is a progressive woman by American standards in the 1930s, and would certainly be considered radical in ancient Greece. She defends her decision to run away with Paris and even encourages other women in the book to embrace their sexuality. Because of this, many have read the book as a satirical nod to gender politics. There is also a common feminist reading of the book because of Helen's attitude toward marriage and sexuality. Because the book was published only five years after the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified, it can be argued that a cultural focus on feminism and women's suffrage influenced why this book was so well received. Helen, in the book, represented a new kind of woman, who did what she wanted rather than what she was told, and defied male authority, which can be argued perpetuated the book's success.  Film The book was adapted into a silent film The Private Life of Helen of Troy in 1927, written by Gerald Duffy and directed by Alexander Korda. The film, and Duffy, were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Title Writing in 1929 (the first year the awards were held).

Opened in 1899, in September 1949, the St. Louis Stock Exchange was acquired by the Chicago Stock Exchange, and renamed the Midwest Stock Exchange. History Early years of the exchange The St. Louis Stock Exchange opened in 1899. Trade volume peaked a year later with $44 million. In April 1902, St. Louis Stock Exchange president Alfred H. Bauer announced that committees had been elected to serve for one year terms. The constitution and bylaws of the new exchange were adopted on January 3, 1903, and made effective on February 1, 1903. According to stock exchange president George Herbert Walker, business transacted on the exchange floor was less in 1904 than in 1903, as with other regional stock exchanges in major cities excluding New York. Trust companies in 1904 traded 18,440 shares for $3,567,591, banks traded 5,698 shares valued at $1,548,878, mining stocks of 17,077 were traded for $7,866, and miscellaneous stocks saw 12,144 shares traded for $770,767. A great deal of business was also done with United Railways, St. Louis Transit Company, and Brown Brothers. Total transactions in 1904 came to $10.5 million, against $16.4 million in 1903. On November 13, 1908, The New York Times reported that stock value in St. Louis banks and trusts companies had increased by $3,020,000 since October 31, due to a \\"complete revival of confidence\\" in the St. Louis Stock Exchange. The times stated that brokers related that it was the heaviest buying the city had seen in three years, leaving them \\"almost unable to accommodate their patrons.\\" Stock value and trading was for companies such as the Mercantile Trust Company, the Boatmen's Bank, the Mechanics' American National Bank, the National Bank of Commerce, and industrial and manufacturing stocks such as the American Car and Foundry Company. On November 13, the latter announced it would reopen its Detroit shops soon as a result on secured contracts. Financial crisis of 1914 After closing for four months during a financial crisis on July 30, 1914, the president of the exchange board of directors announced on December 4, 1914, that the St. Louis Stock Exchange would open the following week. In a meeting on December 7, the governors of the exchange had a special meeting and voted to resume trading in stocks unanimously, with price restrictions and after assurances that bankers believed the financial situation had improved. The meeting noted 180 stocks made public, out of the 565 issues on the board. A statement from the exchange's Committee of Five asserted that the exchange would open again on Saturday, December 12, with hours resuming between 10 and 3 o'clock each day except Saturday, when dealings ended at noon. On the reopening, the Times reported that \\"opening prices were steady and demand for high-grade securities good.\\" Market and policy changes On April 13, 1926, directors of the exchange voted to extend trading time from 75 minutes to two and a half hours, from 10 am to 12:30 pm except Saturday, \\"thereby placing the local exchange on a parity with exchanges in other cities.\\" The board also established stock lists of trading quotations. As of early 1927, Harry S. Rein was chairman of the exchange. On January 12, 1927, he announced that in 1925, the exchange had seen stock sales totaling 591,966 shares, or $32,087,323. In 1926, it had fallen to a total of 382,856 shares, or $17,101,763 in value. On March 26, 1929, the exchange saw a session close without an issue scoring a gain, as \\"nine issues reached new lows\\" for the year. On April 5, 1938, the exchange elected J. Gates Williams as president to succeed president Ben F. Jacobs. Proposed merger On August 30, 1948, the press reported that several brokers in multiple cities were discussing a large merger of several midwestern stock exchanges. The plan at that point included exchanges in Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Cincinnati, New Orleans, and St. Louis. With a projected volume of $350,000,000 a year in trading, it would make the proposed exchange the largest in the United States outside of New York. St. Louis Stock Exchange officers refused to talk to the press about the plan, and the exchange at that point had a normal business annually of $7,000,000. On May 26, the members of the exchange voted twenty-six to eight in favor of the merger. On June 10, 1949, The New York Times reported that the proposed merger had resulted in disagreement within St. Louis financial circles. A key anti- consolidation group was said to include the four companies whose stocks were most active on the local St. Louis exchange: Wagner Electric Company, Laclede Steel Company, F. Burkart Manufacturing Company, and Griesedieck-Western Brewery Company. On June 27, 1949, the president of the St. Louis Chamber of Commerce, George C. Smith, said that the proposed September 1 merger between the St. Louis exchange with three exchanges would cause \\"some grave injuries\\" to the city. The banks also maintained that they might lose most of the exchange business to Chicago banks, where the new proposed exchange would be headquartered. a group opposing the merger sought a new ballot on the project, maintaining that the merger would omit from slower moving St. Louis stocks from the Chicago listings, leaving them to be sold over-the-counter in St. Louis. On June 29, president of St. Louis exchange John A. Isaacs Jr. declared in letter to exchang members and all St. Louis banks that the merger was \\"the only practicable means of providing a strong market for midwest companies,\\" and a necessity. He noted that business in the exchange had been drying up, with much of the business moving east. More protests were lodged in early July 1949, by four brokers in the firm: Paul Brown & Co, A. G. Edwards & Sons, Edward D. Jones & Co. and I. M. Simon & Co.. They said they \\"deny the right of any majority of the members of the exchange here to dissolve.\\" On July 14, 1949, the governing committee of the St. Louis Stock Exchange signed a formal contract to join the new Midwest exchange, overruling the four members firm who had recently voiced opposition. The official merger between the five midwest exchanges was set for September 15, 1949. On June 29, 1949, St. Louis exchange president John A. Isaacs Jr. promoted the merger in a letter, and stated that recent lows in trading were \\"not limited to St. Louis. The trend has been shared by other regional exchanges. After meeting (on the subject of a merger), it was concluded the only way to save an active exchange market for midwestern securities was to concentrate the trading on one large exchange.\\" Merger In September 1949, the St. Louis Stock Exchange was acquired by the Chicago Stock Exchange, and renamed the Midwest Stock Exchange.

ASI maintain an archaeological museum at the Deogarh site, which is noted for its treasured archaeological sculptures.  History  The fort temples are dominated by the Jain temples in the eastern part of the hill fort; the Jain images here are mostly of the \\"iconographic and the stylistic variety\\".The Jain complex was built during 8th to the 17th century and consist of 31 Jain temples housing around 2,000 sculptures which are largest such collection in world. The Jain temples have a large number of panels depicting scenes from Jain mythology, tirthankara images and votive tablets. The pillars are carved with a thousand Jain figures. There are 31 Jain temples of different sizes, age and character. All these are dated later than the Hindu temples. They are categorized into two distinct periods: the early medieval period and the medieval period. During the Islamic iconoclastic depredations the temples were devastated; this was compounded by the growth of vegetation and neglect of maintenance. The Jain community is managing the temples since 1939 and have done some restoration work.  Architecture  Carvings of tirthankaras on Shantinath temple wall. The Jain temples have also been examined individually and reports prepared by ASI. The number of images and inscriptions for each temple has been recorded. These findings testify their political history and early medieval status. Out of the many sculptures in the Jaina compound, more than 400 carvings were worthy of recording for their \\"stylistic and iconographic variety\\". The extravagance of the intricacies of the Jain sculptures are similar to that of nearby Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh and adjoining areas of Bihar. Jain sculptures lie scattered on both sides of the path from the gate, on the walls of the fort. A notable pillar seen here is called the Manastambha. The complete image of each of the 24 Tirthankaras. Images of Yaksha and Yakshini are also part of such depictions. Thousands of sculptures are seen embedded in the walls surrounding the complex. A large number of idols lying scattered around the fort area is attributed to the fact that this was the sculptors' workshop. Worship at some of the Jain temples is still held regularly. The most famous of the Jain temples in the fort is the Shantinath Temple, which was built before 862 AD. It is a testament that a prosperous Jain community lived in this region.  Restoration  In 1959, robbers looted several Jain images or even cut off heads of many images. This resulted in the Jain community of the area taking precautionary action by setting up a temple committee. This temple committee oversees the protection of the monuments and works to improve the ambiance of the entire place. It has been suggested, however, that restoration works being carried out on more scientific terms, following guidelines set by \\"UNESCO's World Heritage Sites\\".

Cooper's is best known for its two-inch-thick pork chop known as the \\"Big Chop\\", and for being President George W. Bush's favorite barbecue restaurant. History Cooper's Old Time Pit Bar-B-Que is one of several restaurants created by the Cooper family since the 1950s. George T. Cooper opened \\"Cooper's Pit Bar-B-Q\\" in Mason, Texas in 1953. George's son, Tommy Cooper, opened his own barbecue restaurant in Llano in 1962, naming his \\"Cooper's Old Time Pit Bar-B-Que\\". Tommy Cooper's restaurant went on to become the most famous of the various Cooper family restaurants. Tommy Cooper died in 1979; his restaurant was operated for a few years by Texas barbecue chef Kenneth Laird, and then the Llano restaurant was acquired by current owner Terry Wootan in 1992. In 2005, Tommy‚Äôs son, Barry, returned to the business & together with Wootan, expanded Cooper‚Äôs business to open five more locations to date. Today, Cooper‚Äôs Old Time Pit Bar-B-Que operates in six cities across the state of Texas. (Llano, New Braunfels, Fort Worth, Austin, College Station & Katy) Cooper's serves brisket, ribs, sausage, chicken and cabrito, but is most well known for its two-inch-thick pork chop, sold as \\"the Big Chop\\". The restaurant smokes its meats in large rectangular pits, using fast-burning mesquite wood to provide a more subtle smoky flavor than slow-smoked barbecue. Cooper's barbecue sauce, served on the side, is a pit-smoked concoction that includes ketchup, vinegar, black pepper, Louisiana hot sauce, lard and brisket drippings. Locations In 2008, Cooper's opened a second location in New Braunfels, Texas. In 2010, Cooper's opened its third location, a 26,000-square-foot venue in the Fort Worth Stockyards next to country nightclub Billy Bob's Texas. Cooper's fourth location, in downtown Austin, Texas, opened in January 2016. Cooper‚Äôs fifth location opened in College Station, Texas, in October 2019 & the sixth location open in Katy, Texas, in November, 2019. Features and awards Cooper's has received positive reviews in The New York Times and The Washington Post. In the early 2000s, President George W. Bush declared it his favorite barbecue restaurant, an honorific that continues to be used in coverage of the restaurant. In 2011, Cooper's was one of five restaurants representing Central Texas in Patricia Schultz's 1,000 Places to See in the USA and Canada Before You Die. In 2015, The Daily Meal ranked Cooper's #10 on its list of best barbecue ribs in the United States. In 2016, food critic and Legends of Texas Barbecue Cookbook author Robb Walsh named Cooper's #8 on his list of 10 favorite Texas barbecue spots.

Early life  George Douglas Ramsay was born in Dumfries, Virginia, on 21 February 1802, the son of a Scottish merchant who had been in business in Alexandria, Virginia, for some time. The family subsequently moved the short distance into Washington, D.C., and George entered the Military Academy in 1814 at the unusually early age of 12. He graduated six years later as the 26th man in the 31 man Class of 1820.  Military career  Commissioned in the Corps of Light Artillery, he was assigned to the 1st U.S. Artillery Regiment in 1821 when that branch was reorganized into regiments. He served in various garrisons in New England and at Fort Monroe, Virginia, and on assignment with the Corps of Topographical Engineers. He was promoted first lieutenant in 1826 and became the adjutant of his regiment in 1833. In February 1835, Ramsay was promoted captain, in which grade he was to serve for 26 years while commanding several arsenals and during his subsequent service in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. He won a brevet majority for gallantry in the Mexican War and served as Chief Ordnance Officer of the Army of Occupation commanded by Major General Zachary Taylor. He returned to peacetime responsibilities as the commandant of several arsenals until assigned to serve on the Ordnance Board on the eve of the Civil War. With the coming of that conflict, his rise, heretofore glacial, was relatively meteoric. He was made a major in April 1861, a lieutenant colonel in August of that same year, and a colonel in June 1863. When in September 1863, Ramsey was named to replace Brigadier General James Ripley as Chief of Ordnance, he was serving as Commandant of the Washington Arsenal. A friend of President Lincoln's, he was selected for his new post over the objections of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, who had previously been irritated by Ramsay's independence, and who preferred the appointment of Captain George T. Balch. A compromise was reached, though without Ramsay's knowledge. He was promoted to brigadier general and Chief of Ordnance, but Balch was given substantive charge of the Office, Chief of Ordnance. This increasingly unhappy arrangement continued for a year, during which time the policies of Ramsay's predecessor were followed virtually without alteration. Ramsay was a pleasant person, hopeful of providing satisfaction to his superiors and not unreceptive to new ideas in the weapons field. His tenure, however, was too short, and he could take little decisive action in this area. Emphasis continued to be placed on seeing to it that adequate supplies reached the soldier on the fighting front. Following continuing difficulties with Secretary Stanton and Capt. Balch, Ramsay was relieved of his post in September, 1864. He then was made Inspector of Arsenals, a post he held until June 1866. (Captain Balch was soon transferred to West Point as an instructor in ordnance, and resigned from the service as a brevet lieutenant colonel in 1865.) Ramsay's last assignment was as commander of the Washington Arsenal, from which post he retired in February 1870, at the age of 68. In 1865, he was brevetted a major general for long and faithful service to the Army. Following his retirement, he lived in Washington, and died there at age 80 on 23 May 1882.

It is native to the Southern Ocean, the Antarctic, South America, southern Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, and has been introduced into European waters where it has become invasive. Description In its native range in the southern hemisphere, Corella eumyota can grow to a length of about and is grey or ivory in colour. The tunics of large individuals are thin, transparent and papery, while smaller individuals, which are a great deal more abundant, are thicker and gelatinous. This species has been introduced into the northern hemisphere and here it is described as being long, semitransparent and white, brown, or orangeish, the siphons often being orange. It is normally recumbent, lying on its right side, roughly oval in shape, but fitting its body to the contours of its surroundings. The inhalent siphon is at the tip of the body and the exhalent siphon a third of the way down the right side. The siphons cannot be retracted. Although the tunic may be clean, it is sometimes covered by a biotic film or overgrown by others of its species or other tunicates. The hind gut can be seen through the tunic and forms a simple curve, and this helps distinguish it in European waters from the fairly similar sea grapes (Molgula spp), which have an \\"S\\"-shaped gut. Distribution Corella eumyota is native to the waters around Antarctica and to the southern parts of South America, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. It has a wide distribution on the Antarctic continental shelf at depths ranging between . It has been introduced into the northern hemisphere and is now present in northwestern Europe, in Spain, France, Ireland and the south coast of England. Ecology Corella eumyota is a suspension feeder, creating a current to draw water in at one siphon, filtering out the food particles and expelling the water through the other siphon. It largely feeds on organic particles stirred up from the sediment. In its native Antarctic waters, this is a slow-growing, long-lived species. It spawns in the austral summer. The larvae are retained inside the body cavity until they are well- advanced; when they are released they settle on the seabed within a few minutes, so groups of this sea squirt are found growing quite close to each other.

The blast destroyed most of the building and killed six civilians and injured about 50 more. Background The Provisional IRA (PIRA) and British government entered into a truce and talks in February 1975. This led Loyalists to believe they were about to be sold into a United Ireland and this provoked the Loyalist paramilitaries, the UDA and UVF, into stepping up their sectarian campaigns against the nationalist community. On 15 March two people were killed and 15 others injured in an attack on Conway's Bar. A week before the Strand Bar attack on 5 April, the UVF using a covername \\" The Protestant Action Force \\" bombed McLaughlin's Bar in the New Lodge area of Belfast killing two more Catholic civilians. In retaliation for the McLaughlin's bar bombing the Republican Action Force blew up a Protestant owned pub the same day, killing 5 and injuring 60 people, which was the worst bombing of the year so far. Strand Bar attack The UVF's Belfast Brigade Staff (its ruling body) argued for the need to hit back even harder after the Mountainview Tavern attack as a show of strength to the Republicans. The attack was a no- warning bombing When the UVF decided to strike the bar was packed with many elderly people in the bar. A white car stopped right outside the bar door and UVF members threw the bomb in. Right after the bomb had been thrown in a burst of shots was directed inside the pub, probably to deter anybody from trying to escape and the explosion came just seconds after the shots of gunfire. People trying to rescue others were hindered when a wall fell down and several more people were injured. Some of the 50 or so injured were badly mutilated with some losing legs and arms. Witness say they saw the white car speed off in to the direction of Loyalist East Belfast. In the confusion a man shot and badly injured as he drove slowly past the bombed pub. After this attack the IRA leadership in Dublin gave their units in Belfast the permission to retaliate to attacks of this nature. The people killed in the attack were Mary McAleavey (57), Elizabeth Carson (64), Marie Bennett (42), Agnes McAnoy (62), Arthur Penn (33) and Michael Mulligan (33) Aftermath As the same as the gun & bomb attack a member of the Official IRA was killed by the Irish National Liberation Army along The Falls Road in Belfast bringing the number of dead to seven for the day. This killing was part of an on-going feud between the INLA and OIRA. The Loyalist paramilitary onslaught against the Nationalist and Catholic community continued at an ever growing pace and became more brutal as time went on. Republicans retaliated with attacks on Protestant civilians * Nine days later, on 21 April, three Catholics, two brothers and a sister were killed when the UVF booby-trapped their family home in Dunganon in Tyrone. * Six days later, on 27 April, three Catholic civilians were shot dead near a social club near Lurgan. * On 23 May two Catholics were shot dead by the UVF near Lurgan. * 10 Days later, on 3 June, the South Armagh Republican Action Force killed two Protestant civilians and a UDR soldier in Killen, South Armagh. Tensions were high as Northern Ireland seemed liked it was braced for an onslaught from both sides. Some of the worst attacks happened that summer and autumn like the UVF McGleenan's Bar bombing which killed three, the Miami Showband killings which killed another 3 civilians, the Bayardo Bar attack by the PIRA which people believe was in response to the Miami attacks, the Tullyvallen Orange Hall massacre by the IRA which killed 5 people, the Belfast and Coleraine attacks, 1975 by the UVF which killed 12 (8 of whom were civilians), the Drummuckavall Ambush where the IRA killed 3 British soldiers in an ambush and the Donnelly's Bar and Kay's Tavern attacks which killed 5 and injured 26 carried out by the UVF with help from the UDR.

The program aired weekdays at 6:00 p.m. ET and was hosted by former His & Hers duo and have each appeared on Highly Questionable as a co host 4 times but not together Michael Smith and Jemele Hill. The show featured some elements from His & Hers and, like SportsCenter with SVP, is more freeform than other editions of SportsCenter. In addition, SC6 focused on the night ahead in sports, as well as breaking sports news as warranted.  History  SC6 was created to boost SportsCenters ratings in the 6 PM hour. On Monday, October 9, 2017, after calling for viewers who disagree with the Dallas Cowboys' decision not to kneel during the National Anthem to pressure them by boycotting their sponsors, Hill was suspended for two weeks, leaving Smith to host SC6 by himself for the time being. However, he instead opted to sit out the Monday episode, and Matt Barrie ended up hosting. During the NFL season, SC6 is also seen Mondays in the same 6:00 p.m. ET time slot on ESPN2, due to Monday Night Countdown being aired simultaneously on ESPN (in the case of the latter program, it moved to its current 6:00 p.m. ET time slot in 2014, which resulted in the Monday editions of SportsCenter being moved to ESPN2). On February 2, 2018, Hill announced that she would be leaving the show to work for ESPN owned The Undefeated, citing her desire to return to more \\"reporting\\". On February 5, 2018 following Hill's departure, Michael Smith became the solo anchor of the 6:00 p.m. ET edition of SportsCenter, which itself reverted to that title as the SC6 branding was dropped. On March 8, 2018, Smith announced that he would also be leaving the show effective immediately.  Reception  Despite initially doing well ratings-wise, SC6s ratings have been lower than the previous incarnation of SportsCenter since March. The Laughing Place liked the duo's chemistry in the pilot, but hoped future episodes would have more variety. Uproxx said the co-host Michael Smith \\"represents everything good about ESPN\\" and applauded both hosts for speaking out on race relations. Many in social media were upset when the series wasn't cancelled when other ESPN employees were laid off. The series was put in the spotlight after Hill labeled current U.S. president Donald Trump a white supremacist, which led Trump to request an apology for this statement. ESPN supposedly wanted to keep Hill from hosting the following episode on Wednesday, but other hosts refused to anchor in her absence, so she hosted that evening. Amidst the controversy SC6's ratings experienced a significant decline of up to 40%.https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/jemele-hill-white- supremacist-trump- espn-1202557572/http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys- top-150-wednesday-cable-originals-network- finals-9-20-2017.htmlhttps://thebiglead.com/2017/05/09/sc6-michael-smith- jemele-hill-ratings-espn-sportscenter/ In May 2018, ESPN announced that SportsCenter's 6:00 p.m. ratings had increased by 10% in the weeks following Hill and Smith's departure.http://www.realclearlife.com/sports/espn- sportscenter-ratings-up-since-exit-of-michael-smith-and-jemele-hill/ In December 2018, respected ESPN executive Norby Williamson admitted that the network \\"miscalculated\\" in trying to center the show around Smith and Hill.https://www.courant.com/sports/olympics/ct-spt-espn-sports-center- changes-20181205-story.html As of May 14, 2018, the 6:00 p.m. ET weeknight editions of SportsCenter are now co-anchored by Kevin Negandhi and Sage Steele.

In 1974, he was named a lecturer in the Regional Science Department at the University of Pennsylvania, where he became an assistant professor in 1975 and a tenured associate professor in 1980. In 1981, he was named an associate professor of public and urban policy for three years retroactive to July 1, 1980. He remained an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania until 1993, and became an emeritus professor there in 2010. Research Vining's research has indicated that the average IQ of Americans has decreased by about 5 points since IQ tests became widely used in the early 20th century, and that high- intelligence people tend to have as many or more children as people who are less intelligent during periods when the overall fertility rate is rising. His research has also found that wealthy families tend to have as many, or fewer, children than do low-income families; he has argued that this pattern occurs because human reproductive behavior is learned, not heritable. Controversial views and affiliations Vining has previously been an editorial board member of the controversial journal Mankind Quarterly, and he has argued that America is undergoing a \\"dysgenesis\\" because more intelligent people in America are not reproducing as often. He has also asserted that this \\"dysgenesis\\" is especially harmful to African Americans. His work was cited in the prominent 1994 book the Bell Curve, and he has received $197,750 in grants from the Pioneer Fund, for which he has been criticized as a \\"race scientist\\". Vining has responded to these criticisms by saying that the media has unfairly characterized him and the Pioneer Fund.

She has walked several catwalks for brands including Gypsy Sport at both London and NYC Fashion Weeks. Bergdorf was the first transgender model in the UK for L'Or√©al, but was dropped within weeks after a racial row. In February 2018, she was appointed as an LGBT adviser to the Labour Party, but resigned the following month. Bergdorf appeared in the Channel 4 documentary What Makes A Woman, which aired in May 2018. Bergdorf won ‚ÄòChangemaker of the Year‚Äô at the 2018 Cosmopolitan Awards, and was awarded an honorary doctorate in 2019 by the University of Brighton. She joined UN Women UK as an advocate in 2019, supporting its #DrawALine campaign, aiming to put a stop to female genital mutilation (FGM). Early life Bergdorf was born and grew up in Stansted Mountfitchet, Essex. Bergdorf is mixed-race, born to an Afro-Jamaican father and a white English mother. Bergdorf attended Bentfield County Primary School in Stansted Mountfitchet and then The Bishop's Stortford High School, an all- boys' school. Bergdorf describes growing up as a \\"very effeminate boy\\". Later, she studied English at the University of Brighton, describing herself there as genderqueer. Bergdorf then worked for three years in fashion PR. At the age of 24, Bergdorf began gender transitioning, and was the subject of an episode of London Live show Drag Queens of London. Around the same time that Bergdorf was transitioning, she co-founded nightclub Pussy Palace. Modelling Bergdorf became involved in modelling after being motivated by the lack of diversity in the industry. Her first modelling job was for a Lebanese couture company. In 2014, the London Evening Standard referred to her as \\"a cornerstone of London's trans scene.\\" She told the newspaper that she was \\"so vocal\\" on trans issues because she sees it as \\"the new frontier\\", an issue being brought into public consciousness through the work of trans women like Laverne Cox and Carmen Carrera. She came to public attention in August 2017 when she was employed as the first transgender model to front a L'Or√©al campaign in the UK, being announced as one of 27 models taking part in L'Or√©al UK's \\"True Match\\" campaign. On her social media, she stated: \\"Thank you L‚ÄôOr√©al Paris for giving me this platform. I hope it reaches another little eight-year-old trans girl and makes her feel a little more hopeful and a little less scared about her future, than what was installed in me when I was her age.\\" Elsewhere she stated: \\"I definitely set out to empower girls like me.\\" Racial controversy In February 2018, Bergdorf stated that 'white people as a group are brought up racist', stating: \\"most of y‚Äôall don‚Äôt even realise or refuse to acknowledge that your existence, privilege and success as a race is built on the backs, blood and death of people of colour.\\" Bergdorf attracted further public attention following an article in The Daily Mail highlighting Facebook comments that she had made, which included the claim that all white people were guilty of \\"racial violence\\" and that the white race was \\"the most violent and oppressive force of nature on Earth.\\" In response to Bergdorf's comments, L'Or√©al dropped her from their campaign on 1 September 2017.Joel Backaler, Digital Influence (2018, ), page 139 They issued a statement that the company \\"supports diversity and tolerance towards all people irrespective of their race, background, gender and religion\\" and that Bergdorf's comments about white people were \\"at odds with those values\\". Facebook removed her posts from their website, regarding them as being in contravention to its rules against hate speech. Bergdorf said she also faced online harassment, much of it of a racist and transphobic nature. Other commentators argued that The Daily Mail had quoted her out of context, and that her wider point about white supremacy and white privilege in Western societies was valid and needed wider dissemination. Bergdorf defended her position, arguing that she was angry after the scenes in the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville and wanted to explain that racism was systemic, and that being racist was not just about attacking people, but failing to take action against the system. She added: \\"I don't see how calling out the roots of racism, somehow makes you a racist\\", calling the controversy the \\"worst time of my life\\". In September 2017, the UK-based Illamasqua hired Bergdorf as the face of its Beauty Spotlight campaign, which concerned gender fluidity. In a statement, the company described Bergdorf as embodying \\"diversity and individuality; she is not scared to be truly herself.\\" It added that it did not \\"stand or accept any form of racism, but we also believe Munroe‚Äôs comments have been edited out of context by a certain media title (who we won't bother naming) without telling a true story\\". In June 2020, during the international George Floyd protests, Bergdorf called out L'Or√©al Paris for posting on Instagram that they stood in solidarity with the Black community. She noted that she had never received an apology from L'Or√©al. In response, the company announced that they would create and appoint Bergdorf to a U.K. Diversity & Inclusion Advisory Board. Bergdorf shared on Instagram a number of abusive messages she received on that platform following her appointment. Activism The same month she was hired by Illamasqua, Bergdorf gave a verbal performance of Maya Angelou's poem \\"Still I Rise\\" for a short film directed by Bec Evans and Laura Kirwan-Ashman. In February 2018, she was appointed as an LGBT adviser to the Labour Party, which she resigned from the following month after her previous homophobic and misogynistic comments received attention. Bergdorf apologised for her past comments. Bergdorf later blamed \\"Conservative media\\" for using her as a \\"political pawn to bring down Jeremy Corbyn\\" and that the Labour LGBT advisory board was being targeted to be shut down, stating \\"when I left they went after somebody else, and then when that person left they went after somebody else\\" in order to \\"discredit Jeremy Corbyn\\". As of April 2019, she has made frequent appearances as a guest commentator on ITV's Good Morning Britain and This Morning. In June 2019, Bergdorf was stripped of her role as an ambassador for Childline two days after being appointed, when journalist Janice Turner and others questioned her suitability for the post as somebody who had modelled for adult magazine Playboy. Several days later, the NSPCC offered Bergdorf a 'full, frank and unreserved apology' for the way in which it had handled her dismissal. The NSPCC's CEO, Peter Wanless, explained that Bergdorf had been dismissed 'because of her public statements, which we felt would mean that she was in breach of our own risk assessments and undermine what we are here to do'. In July 2019, Bergdorf was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Brighton in recognition of her campaigning for transgender rights.

He has trained as an infectious diseases physician and has been living in Bangkok since 2000. He is best known for his research in severe falciparum malaria, a disease that requires intensive care in hospital, an interest he developed following studies in rheology. Dondorp highlights the significant importance of antimalarial drug resistance, particularly of artesunate, which have been used to treat malaria. As a result, he chairs the World Health Organization Technical Expert Group on antimalarial medication drug resistance and Containment.  Early life and education  Born in Utrecht, The Netherlands, Dondorp studied medicine at the University of Amsterdam between 1982 and 1986, achieving a 'doctoral' in medicine, 'with distinction'. He became interested in blood flow properties (rheology) whilst he was a medical student and had found that 'red cell deformability' was extraordinarily reduced in falciparum malaria in returning Dutch travellers, an observation which was to steer him towards studies in the pathophysiologygy of malaria. By 1999, he was registered as physician in infectious diseases, when he also completed a PhD in the pathophysiology of severe falciparum malaria, with special reference to ‚Äòred cell deformability‚Äô. This research included clinical analyses completed in Thailand (1995-1996) and Kenya (1997-1998). A year later he was registered as intensive care physician at Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Since 2001, Dondorp has continued his research as Deputy Director and Head of Malaria Research, Mahidol-Oxford Research Unit (MORU), Bangkok, Thailand.  Background and research  Dondrop‚Äôs foremost research interests have focused attention on the pathophysiology and treatment of severe malaria, antimalarial drug resistance and development of intensive care practice in low income countries. \\"The main reason you become so ill from severe malaria is that the red blood cells harbouring the parasite become very sticky and adhere to the walls of the smallest blood vessels in all the vital organs, such as the brain, kidney and lung vasculature. This blocks normal circulation and can be fatal.\\" - Dondorp Findings from his clinical studies of the small blood vessels (microcirculation) in patients with severe malaria have revealed that red cells become rigid and lose ability to change shape. They lose their flexibility to pass through blood vessels that are smaller in diameter than the red cells. This rigidity impairs blood flow through the small blood vessels. Dondorp‚Äôs team demonstrated this impairment of microcirculatory flow due to red cell rigidity in severe malaria. A strong prognostic significance was also found to be the amount of plasma PfHRP2, a protein released by the sequestrated parasite. This protein contributes to the metabolic acidosis seen in people with severe malaria. His team, however, demonstrated resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to artemisinins in Western Cambodia. New treatments would have to be found to contain efforts against this serious threat to global malaria control. He has highlighted that resistance to artemisinin and piperaquine is a genuine worry, and should malaria become untreatable, would be a significant threat to controlling the spread of malaria from South East Asia to Africa, which is therefore is a \\"race against time\\".  The World Health Organization  Artesunate is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) in preference to quinidine for the treatment of severe malaria and has been used worldwide for many years. Artesunate is in the class of medications known as artemisinins, which are derivatives from sweet wormwood (Artemisia annua). Dondorp hopes to make best use of the wide range of expertise in the Technical Expert Group on Antimalarial Drug Resistance. They advise, design and execute programmes for the WHO on aspects of containing artemisinin resistance.

It is located at the exit of the Kleinwalsertal near Tiefenbach, a city district of Oberstdorf. It is one of the deepest gorges of the Bavarian Alps and the deepest rocky gorge of Central Europe.breitachklamm.com Every year around 300.000 visitors walk the 2.5 km long path through the gorge. The upper entrance of the Breitachklamm is located near the Walserschanz in Austria, with limited parking space, whereas the lower one in Oberstdorf-Tiefenbach offers a visitor center and ample parking.  Formation  The Breitachklamm was formed only during the last 10,000 years after the W√ºrm ice age. Glaciers had eroded soft rocks, and hard rocks remained. When the glaciers had melted, the Breitach river had to grind its way through the hard rocks, over a distance of 2.5 km and up to deep.  Development  The rockfall of 1995 The first efforts to make the gorge accessible date from the end of the 19th century, but they were not successful. Eventually the young pastor Johannes Schiebel from Tiefenbach ventured to develop the Klamm, sought sponsors and founded the Breitachklammverein eG (Breitachklamm society). His main motivation was to find a new source of income for his poor parish and to develop the upcoming tourism in the region. The first blasting was executed on July 25, 1904, and on July 4, 1905, the access to the gorge was inaugurated. On September 23, 1995, at 6:00 a.m. a massive rockfall occurred, causing of rock and debris to slide into the gorge. Subsequently, 300,000 m¬≥ of water were dammed up high. On March 23, 1996, at 11:30 a.m. the water broke through, thoroughly devastating the gorge and causing damages of 150,000 euros. In December 2004 a new visitor center was put into operation. By means of interactive models the effect of water on the mountains is demonstrated.

For two decades, she was the only woman conducting archaeological and anthropological studies in the country. Her research focused on Colombia and the Caribbean and along with her husband, she founded University of the Andes' Department of Anthropology. She occupied Chair 15 of the Colombian Academy of Exact, Physical and Natural Sciences until 2008 and was the only anthropologist to be a member during her tenure. In 2010, she was honored by the French Government with the designation of officer of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. Early life Alicia Duss√°n Maldonado was born on 16 October 1920 in Bogot√°, Colombia to Lucrecia Maldonado Parra and Agust√≠n Duss√°n Quiroga. Her father was a landowner, originally from Villavieja and her mother was a passionate liberal nationalist, as her father, Jos√© Mar√≠a Maldonado Neira, had served as a General in the Thousand Days' War. Another ancestor from her Parra line was Antonio Mar√≠a D√≠az, who had fought in the Battle of Boyac√°. From the third grade, Duss√°n developed an interest in other cultures, particularly those of Africa and Asia, as well as a curiosity with Colombia's indigenous people. Duss√°n attended the Gimnasio Femenino (Women's Gymnasium) in Bogot√°, a prestigious private school which incorporated a Montessori method as well as moral instruction to prepare young women to become good wives and mothers. She was one of the first group of young women in Colombia who pursued higher education and a career. Duss√°n's father died before she completed high school. She graduated in 1938 and with the consent of her mother, decided to go to Europe to further her studies. She enrolled in the University of Berlin studying German Culture and Language. and while she was in Europe took the opportunity to visit many museums, seeing for the first time archeological objects from South America. She was forced to return to Colombia at the outbreak of World War II. Duss√°n enrolled in the Faculty of Law at the National University of Colombia in 1940, but fascinated by archeology attended lectures offered by Paul Rivet. After studying law through 1941, she transferred to the National Ethnological Institute (NEI), which had recently been founded by Rivet. The program was an innovative approach to scientifically based methodology, rather than rote memorization. Students were encouraged to evaluate the biological, cultural and technological influences of indigenous peoples upon each other. Receiving her degree in 1942, the following year, Duss√°n married fellow student Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff. Career Between 1942 and 1945 Duss√°n worked as research assistant at NEI and jointly worked with her husband on an evaluation of funerary urns in the Magdalena Department and carried out a study on the physical anthropology of the Pijao people of the Tolima Department. During this period, she also gave birth to the couple's first child, Ren√© Reichel Duss√°n. She was awarded research grant to carry out studies in 1944 from the French government. Besides the difficulty of the physical work, Duss√°n had to face criticism from local priests and other members of society, who felt that her dress and behavior were inappropriate for a woman. For the first two decades of her career, she was the only woman working in anthropology in Colombia, and was ridiculed for not choosing a career as a social worker or nurse, if she insisted on working. Wearing pants, instead of the customary dresses for women at that time, and becoming one of the first women to drive a car resulted in people calling her a man and throwing stones at her. In 1946, she co-founded with her husband the Ethnological Institute of Magdalena and worked there through 1950. Collecting ceramics and ethnographic materials, they established a museum of pieces they amassed during their joint archaeological fieldwork in an area they designated as Pueblito, which is now in the Tayrona National Natural Park, and the river valleys surrounding the Rancher√≠a and Cesar Rivers. One particularly important ritual they documented was a practice of secondary burial among the Yuko or Yukpa people who lived in the northeastern part of the Cesar Department. Working on the slopes of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Duss√°n who was pregnant again, collected materials from the local indigenous people on their mythology, socialization processes, and traditions. Using field questionnaires designed and adapted from Margaret Mead's methodology, she made pioneering studies on gender relations and parenting traditions in Taganga. In 1951, Duss√°n began working as a research assistant to the Colombian Institute of Anthropology and History until 1956. She and her husband undertook work at a site known as Aritama, a pseudonym for At√°nquez, where they could study the villagers of the Kankuamo people. The mestizo town offered an opportunity to study the transitions between cultures, as to those in nearby Valledupar, the village was known as an indigenous town, but to those living in traditional native communities, At√°nquez was viewed as a \\"Spanish\\" town. The couple's findings, which included Duss√°n's analysis of the social changes, documented how the society had been reshaped by contact would be published as The People of Aritama (1961), which quickly became a classic of the studies of early society in Colombia. Her work was funded in part by a research grant from the Wenner Gren Foundation in New York City. Between 1954 and 1958, the couple lived in Cartagena and worked in a collaborative program sponsored by the University of Cartagena and their new department focusing on public health and preventative medicine. The program allowed them to participate in archaeological digs along the Caribbean coast of Colombia, and conduct medical anthropological studies, which were insightful for their findings on At√°nquez. Returning to Bogot√° in 1960, Duss√°n took a job with the Inter-American Center for Housing and Planning (IACHP) and later that year, she took a position as a research associate of the Institute of Andean Research in Washington, D. C. through 1962. These organizations allowed exploration to continue on the Pacific coast, in an area ranging from Panama's Dari√©n Province to the Colombia‚ÄìEcuador border. Very little archaeological work had been done in the area at the time. While studying in the area, El Hermanito an apocalyptic prophet became the subject of one of her studies. El Hermanito‚Ä≤s doomsday predictions affected both the customs and local economy, causing both indigenous and Afro-Colombian populations to sell off their belongings or sacrifice them into the river, and kill off their livestock. Duss√°n's study of the movement was the first religiously based anthropological study of its kind in Latin America. The association with the IACHP allowed Duss√°n to study urban problems, evaluating marginal neighborhoods. One such study focused on the El Carmen neighborhood of Bogot√°. In 1964, the Reichels founded the Department of Anthropology at the Universidad de los Andes at the suggestion of the rector, Ram√≥n de Zubir√≠a. Financed by the Ford Foundation, they designed a program which would grant a degree in applied anthropology covering studies in archaeology, ethnology, linguistics, material culture studies and physical anthropology. In addition to working as a professor in the department, Duss√°n traveled at her own expense to evaluate the anthropology departments at New York University, Tulane University, and UCLA to develop programs which could be adapted for the new department. Duss√°n published Problemas y necesidades de la investigaci√≥n etnol√≥gica en Colombia (Problems and Needs of Ethnological Research in Colombia, 1965) which stressed the urgency of evaluating those communities in danger of having their cultures usurped by modernization. The essay had international impact and created discussion on the importance of fieldwork and preserving indigenous cultures. In 1967, she served as the Colombian representative to the first international conference, held in Austria, which discussed teaching anthropology in Latin America and her paper, presented at the conference urged that their program was ready to undertake postgraduate training. Between 1967 and 1968, Duss√°n served as an advisor to the Gold Museum, Bogot√° to develop scripts for the museum exhibits. After 1968, she no longer participated in field work on archaeological sites. Throughout her career, she published 40 books, around half as a co-author with her husband, and nearly 500 articles. While continuing to work in a consultative role with the Gold Museum, Duss√°n was appointed to serve as the head of the Division of Museums and Restoration of the Colombian Institute of Culture in 1970. Simultaneously, as a Guggenheim Fellow, she worked on a project sponsored by Harvard University and the Colombian National Institute of Nutrition to evaluate the effects of malnutrition on mental development in Colombia. She resigned from the museum post in 1973 and between 1975 and 1977 worked among the Kogi people completing archaeological and ethnological studies. In 1978, Duss√°n moved to Los Angeles, California and worked as a visiting curator for the Museum of Cultural History. In 1980, she transferred to the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, where she remained until 1982. Returning to Colombia, she began work on as a co-producer of an audiovisual media project on Colombian culture created by the Ministry of Education. Duss√°n was one of the founders and a charter member of the Academy of Sciences of the Third World, created in 1983 to promote scholarship and stimulus to develop scientific study. She also led the drive to create the Academy of Women Scientists of the Third World. In 1984, she was recognized by the Colombian Congress of Anthropology with Meritorious Honor, grade III. That same year, she became a coordinator at the Institute of Colombian Culture, in the Cultural Communications Division and then in 1988, coordinated institutional relations for the Colombian Academy of Exact, Physical and Natural Sciences through 1989. In 1993, Duss√°n was awarded the Honor of Cultural Merit from the mayor of Bogot√°, in 1998 she elected as an Officer of the Order of Democracy of the Republic of Colombia by the legislature, and in 2001 was recognized with the Honor of Scientific Woman of Success. The Ministry of Culture in conjunction with the Colombian Academy of Exact, Physical and Natural Sciences bestowed upon her the Lifetime Achievement prize for her scientific body of work in 2002. She occupied Chair 15 of the Colombian Academy of Exact, Physical and Natural Sciences until 2008, when she was granted the status Honorary Academic. During her tenure, she was the only anthropologist to be a member of the organization. In 2010, the French Government honored her as an officer of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.

While this destruction constitutes a war crime in violation of the Hague and Geneva Conventions, it is also the counterpart to a sanctioned cultural heritage policy carried out for decades before the war.\\" In all, 225 out of 600 mosques in Kosovo were damaged, vandalised, or destroyed alongside other Islamic architecture during the conflict. Additionally 500 Albanian owned kulla dwellings (traditional stone tower houses) and three out of four well-preserved Ottoman period urban centres located in Kosovo cities were badly damaged resulting in great loss of traditional architecture. Kosovo's public libraries, of which 65 out of 183 were completely destroyed, amounted to a loss of 900,588 volumes, while Islamic libraries sustained damage or destruction resulting in the loss of rare books, manuscripts and other collections of literature. Archives belonging to the Islamic Community of Kosovo, records spanning 500 years, were also destroyed. During the war, Islamic architectural heritage posed for Yugoslav Serb paramilitary and military forces as Albanian patrimony with destruction of non-Serbian architectural heritage being a methodical and planned component of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo.. \\"One aspect of this consolidation involved the narration of late-socialist vandalism against Serbian Orthodox graves and cemeteries as \\"ethnic violence\\" carried out by Kosovar Albanians against Serbs; another involved the postsocialist destruction of Islamic buildings posed as Albanian patrimony by Serb military and paramilitary forces.\\"  History   Yugoslav Period  For around five centuries being a province of the Ottoman Empire, numerous examples of Ottoman architecture existed in Kosovo. In the aftermath of World War Two, Yugoslavia was governed by communist authorities who implemented various modernisation drives toward changing the architectural landscape and design of urban settlements. These measures were aimed at altering the panorama of a settlement that was deemed to have elements associated with an unwanted Ottoman past and features deemed as \\"backward\\".. Starting from the late 1940s, architectural heritage in main urban centres of Kosovo began to be destroyed, mainly conducted by the local government as part of urban modernisation schemes. During the 1950s this process was undertaken by the Urban Planning Institute (Urbanistiƒçki zavod) of Yugoslavia with the most prominent example in Kosovo of the socialist modernisation drive being in Prishtin√´. The Ottoman Prishtina bazaar contained 200 shops set in blocks devoted to a craft or guild owned by Albanians grouped around a mosque, located in the centre of Prishtin√´. These buildings were expropriated in 1947 and demolished by labour brigades known as Popular Fronts (Albanian: , Serbian: ).. \\"Kosovo was a province of the Ottoman empire for five centuries and its territory contained many examples of Ottoman architecture, yet only one Ottoman-era monument, the Sultan Murat Turbe, was classified as ‚Äúcultural monument‚Äù in this period; the other such monuments were drawn from the patrimony of the Serbian Orthodox Church.... Premodernity was reified not only by preservation of its treasured signs, however, but also by the elimination of its obsolete components: an abject heritage whose purpose, in modernization, was to be destroyed. This destruction was also institutionalized in socialist modernization. By the 1950s, this modernization was the responsibility of the Urban Planning Institute (Urbanistiƒçki zavod) in the capital cities of all republics. Before then, however, destruction was also planned and managed by local governments as part of urban modernization schemes. In Kosovo, beginning in the late 1940s, the destruction of abject heritage took place in each major city, most prominently in Kosovo‚Äôs capital city of Prishtina. The modernization of Prishtina was initiated with the destruction of the Ottoman-era bazaar (ƒçar≈°ija) at the center of the city: in 1947, the provincial government expropriated the buildings in the bazaar in the name of urban renewal and then demolished them.... Laid out in the fifteenth century, Prishtina‚Äôs bazaar was composed of some two hundred shops arranged around a mosque (xhami in Albanian, d≈æamija in Serbian); these shops were owned by and operated by members of Prishtina‚Äôs Albanian community. The shops were set within blocks, each devoted to a particular guild or craft.... Like other public works at the time in Yugoslavia, the destruction of Prishtina‚Äôs bazaar was organized by labor brigades called Popular Fronts (Fronti populluer in Albanian, Narodnifront in Serbian).\\" In 1952, the Yugoslav government founded the Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments of Kosovo tasked with dealing with issues relating to cultural heritage in Kosovo. During post-war communist Yugoslavia, only one Ottoman era monument the Tomb of Sultan Murad I was listed as a cultural monument, while state protection status was given mainly to Serbian Orthodox Church architecture in Kosovo. The criteria for listing mosques as historic monuments was much more restrictive than for Serbian Orthodox architecture. Buildings who had protection status received funding for historical preservation, while unlisted mosques, many from the Ottoman period that were renovated during this time was done without the Institute‚Äôs supervision often resulting in damage or original architectural elements being destroyed. On the eve of the Kosovo conflict, only 15 mosques out of the 600 or more mosques had been awarded the status of historic monument, unlike 210 Orthodox Serbian churches, gravesites and monasteries that had been awarded the status of protected historic monument.. \\"While the construction of religious buildings in Yugoslavia was restricted from the establishment of Tito‚Äôs Communist government in 1945 until the relaxation of church-state relations in the mid-1970s, the Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments of Kosovo, founded in 1952, institutionalized the production of cultural heritage in Kosovo and provided another field on which an ideology of culture would play itself out. By the time of last year‚Äôs war, some 210 Serbian Orthodox churches, monasteries, and gravesites were listed as protected historic monuments in Kosovo, including over forty churches built between the 1930s and the 1990s. In contrast, only fifteen of the more than six hundred mosques in Kosovo were listed as historic monuments, even though well over half of these mosques date from the Ottoman era (fourteenth through nineteenth centuries). As the criteria for considering mosques as ‚Äúhistoric monuments‚Äù were far more restrictive than those for Serbian Orthodox buildings, Kosovo‚Äôs cultural heritage was materially transformed: while listed buildings received all funds designated for historic preservation, the renovation of unlisted mosques was undertaken without the Institute‚Äôs supervision and frequently resulted in the damaging or destruction of original architectural elements.\\"  Kosovo Conflict (1998-1999)  Destroyed house with damaged Hadum Mosque in the background in Gjakove, 1999 The Kosovo conflict triggered a counter-insurgency campaign in 1998-1999 by Yugoslav Serb armed forces (VJ) fighting against Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) fighters that escalated into the Kosovo war (1999) and military intervention from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).. During the counter- insurgency campaign Yugoslav Serb forces targeted collections of various state archives and buildings, museums and libraries; Islamic libraries, Muslim theological schools and Sufi lodges (tekkes). Before the 1999 war, the reserve collection consisting of multiple deposit copies of publications at the National Library of Kosovo in Prishtin√´ kept for use within Kosovo for other libraries, was pulped at the Lipjan paper mill through an order by the Serbian library director.. \\"The situation of the archives in the Kosovo Conflict also applied to the libraries. At the beginning of October 1990, ethnic Albanian faculty arid students were ejected by Serbian police from classrooms and offices, and the University of Pri≈°tina became an apartheid institution reserved for ethnic Serbs only. At the same time, non-Serb readers were banned from the National and University Library and Albanian professionals were summarily dismissed from their positions at the libraries. The acquisition of Albanian-language library materials effectively ceased. No records and printed books relating to the Albanian community were acquired after 1990 and only 22,000 items were added to the collections in Kosovo in that period. A few years later a number of library facilities in Kosovo were converted to other uses. Parts of the National and University Library building in Pri≈°tina were turned over to a Serbian Orthodox religious school; library offices were used to house Serb refugees from Croatia and Bosnia. For almost a decade, Kosovar Albanians, the majority of Kosovo‚Äôs inhabitants, were not allowed to set foot inside their libraries. The Library‚Äôs reserve collection ‚Äî multiple deposit copies of publications in Albanian kept for exchange and for distribution to public libraries elsewhere in Kosovo ‚Äî were gone; they had been sent to the Lipljan paper mill for pulping before the war by order of the Serbian library director (Riedlmayer, 1995, 2000a).\\" During the 1999 war, 65 (a third of a total of 183) Kosovo public libraries were fully destroyed resulting in the combined loss of 900,588 volumes. Kosovo school libraries were destroyed during the war. In 1999, certain archives and collections were also removed from Kosovo into Serbia, such as the archive of the Institute for the Protection of Monuments of Kosovo from the organisation's building in Prishtin√´ by employees belonging to the Yugoslav Ministry of Interior.. \\"The 1998-99 counter-insurgency campaign conducted by Serb forces in Kosovo comprised such a catastrophe, as its targets included the buildings and collections of various state archives, libraries, and museums; and Islamic libraries, theological schools, and Sufi lodges. Some archives and collections were also removed from Kosovo into Serbia proper; in 1999, for example, the archives of the Institute for the Protection of Monuments of Kosovo were taken from the institute's building in Prishtina/Pri≈°tina by staff from the Yugoslav Ministry of Interior, as of the writing of this books, these materials remain in the ministry's possession.\\" The Yugoslav Serbian Ministry of Justice claimed that the removal of public records from Kosovo to Serbia in 1999 was \\"to prevent the Albanian secessionists from destroying or forging [them]\\". Some Kosovo municipal registries were also burned where they were held.. \\"As early as March 1991, records appear to have been deliberately removed. When the Serbs finally withdrew in 1999 public records and archives comprising almost the entire documentary base for the orderly functioning of government and society in Kosovo were removed; some municipal registries were even burned on the spot. The Ministry of Justice in Belgrade announced that public records in Kosovo had been removed to Serbia ‚Äòto prevent the Albanian secessionists from destroying or forging [them]‚Äô (Jackson and Stepniak, 2000). Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of Kosovars, who were deprived of their personal documents when they were expelled in the spring of 1999, whose passports or licences have expired, who wish to register a marriage, buy or sell property, settle a legal dispute or claim an inheritance, are left stranded in a legal and documentary limbo (Frederiksen and Bakken, 2000; MacKenzie 1996; Riedlmayer, 2000a).\\" The central historical archive belonging to the Islamic Community of Kosovo containing community records spanning 500 years was burned down on June 13, 1999 by Yugoslav Serb police after an armistice and some hours before NATO peacekeeping troops came to Prishtin√´.. \\"By the end of the eleven week war, 65 of Kosovo‚Äôs 183 public libraries, a third of the total, had been completely destroyed. The Kosovo public library network‚Äôs combined losses were assessed at 900,588 volumes. More than a third of school libraries in Kosovo were also destroyed in the war (Fredericksen & Bakken, 2000). A number of religious libraries and archives of Kosovo‚Äôs Islamic community were also burned. Among them was the Islamic endowment (waqf) library of Hadum Suleiman Aga in the western Kosovo town of Gjakova/Djakovica, founded in 1595 and burned by Serb troops at the end of March 1999 with the complete loss of its collection of 200 ancient manuscripts and 1,300 old printed books. Another irretrievable loss was that of the central historical archive of the Islamic Community of Kosovo, in Pri≈°tina, with community records going back more than five hundred years, which was burned by Serbian police on June 13, 1999, after the armistice and just hours before the arrival of the first NATO peacekeeping troops in the city (Riedlmayer, 2000).\\" Of Sufi lodges, the Axhize Baba Bektashi teqe in Gjakov√´ was burned during May by Yugoslav Serb soldiers using shoulder-launched incendiary grenades resulting in the loss of 2,000 rare books and over 250 manuscripts like a 12th century Persian manuscript. The Hadum Suleiman Aga library (founded 1595) in Gjakov√´, was burned down (March 24) by Yugoslav Serb troops resulting in the loss of 1,300 rare books and 200 manuscripts written in Aljamiado (Albanian in Arabic script), Arabic and Ottoman Turkish along with the regional archives of the Islamic Community spanning to the 17th century. In Pej√´, the library of Atik Medrese was burned down with only its outer walls remaining, resulting in the loss of 100 manuscript codices and 2,000 printed books. In Ferizaj the Atik Medrese theological school dating from the Ottoman period was burned down with its remains being bulldozed.. \\"The burning on 24 March of the library of Hadum Suleiman Aga in Djakovica with holdings of ca. 200 manuscripts and 1,300 rare books in Ottoman Turkish, Arabic and Aljamiado (Albanian in Arabic script), and the regional archives of the Islamic Community (KBI) with records going back to the 17th century. The destruction of the Bektashi tekke (dervish lodge) of Axhize Baba in Djakovica (Gjakova), which had one of the most valuable collections of Islamic manuscripts in the region. The fire consumed 250 manuscripts and more than 2,000 rare books; the computerized catalogue was burned along with the library. The tekke was burned to the ground at the beginning of May 1999 by Serbian troops using shoulder-launched incendiary grenades. The library of the Atik Medrese, in Peja, was burned to the ground, with only parts of the outer walls still standing and its collection of 2,000 printed books and ca. 100 manuscript codices a total loss. The Ottoman-era theological school, the Atik Medrese in Urosevac (Ferizaj) was also burned down and the remains levelled by bulldozer.\\" The League of Prizren museum in Prizren was destroyed with rifle-propelled grenades by Yugoslav Serb police during March 1999. Serbian cross symbol with four Cyrillic Cs inscribed on a building during the Kosovo war, 1999 In the aftermath of the war, a report in August 1999 by Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) documented that within Kosovo 155 mosques were destroyed, based on accounts by refugees.. According to the Islamic Community of Kosovo the duration of conflict resulted in an estimated 217 mosques being damaged, destroyed or demolished along with 4 madrassas (traditional Muslim schools) and 3 Sufi lodges. Of the 498 mosques in Kosovo that were in active use, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) documented that 225 mosques sustained damage or destruction by the Yugoslav Serb army. In all, eighteen months of the Yugoslav Serb counterinsurgency campaign between 1998-1999 within Kosovo resulted in 225 or a third out of a total of 600 mosques being damaged, vandalised, or destroyed. Some Islamic architecture was damaged within the context of the fighting.. \\"The Board of the Islamic Community of Kosovo estimates that 217 mosques were damaged, demolished or destroyed as well as four Medresses (traditional Islamic schools) and three Tekkes (traditional Sufi prayer halls). Although some of these buildings were damaged in the course of the fighting, it is clear that others were deliberately targeted.\\" Mosques and other Islamic buildings however in certain urban neighbourhoods and villages became the only targets of violence against architecture, while in other locations every mosque and all Islamic buildings became targeted. Often at the conclusion of an attack on a village and the fleeing of the population from villages, towns and cities, attacks on mosques, other Islamic buildings and architecture were undertaken and widespread by the Yugoslav Serb army.. \\"The attack on Landovica‚Äôs mosque was reprised throughout Kosovo during the eighteen months of the Serb counterinsurgency campaign. Approximately 225 of Kosovo‚Äôs 600 mosques were vandalized, damaged, or destroyed during that campaign. In some urban neighborhoods and villages, mosques and other Islamic buildings were the only targets of architectural violence; in other settings, all mosques and Islamic buildings were targeted. In the trial of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, and in an emerging historical discourse, as well, the above serves as key evidence of the ‚Äúethnic‚Äù dimension of the violence inflicted against Kosovar Albanians, with mosques posed as objective ethno-religious signs or symbols. But this destruction provides, more fundamentally evidence of the performative dimension of ‚Äúethnic violence‚Äù‚Äîof the way in which violence ‚Äúdoes not essentially limit itself to transporting an already constituted semantic content guarded by its own aiming at truth.‚ÄùIn Landovica, Serb forces toppled the minaret of the village mosque following their attack on the village and the flight of its inhabitants. This was typical of attacks on mosques and other buildings identified as examples of Islamic heritage.\\" Attacks at times entailed the toppling of a mosque minaret, having minaret tops shot off, explosive devices placed in a minaret or within a mosque, bulldozing of mosques, fires started in a mosque, artillery aimed at a minaret and walls riddled with bullets. The vandalisation of mosques also occurred, anti- Albanian and anti-Islamic vandalism, the graffiting of facades with images and text and in certain examples, anti-Albanian and pro-Serbian graffiti was inscribed on the walls of a mosque. Graffiti left on mosques by the Yugoslav Serb army often had the words \\"Kosovo je Srbija\\" (Kosovo is Serbia), \\"Srbija\\" (Serbia), \\"Mi smo Srbi\\" (We are Serbs) while the most common graffiti was a cross with four Cyrillic Cs in each corner, a Serbian national symbol..\\"Typically, rather, they were transformed through particular sorts of damage and vandalism: mosques were vandalized; minarets were toppled or their tops were shot off; walls were riddled with bullets; and facades were graffitied with texts and images (Figures 3.5‚Äî3.8).... As graffiti, some of the representations comprised by violence were linguistic texts. Frequent graffiti on mosques were ‚ÄúSrbija‚Äù (Serbia), ‚ÄúKosovo je Srbija‚Äù (Kosovo is Serbia), and ‚ÄúMi smo Srbi‚Äù (We are Serbs) (Figures 3.6‚Äî3.8). In these graffiti, that is, Serbs represented that they were Serbs and that Kosovo was Serbian: the very presumptions of Serb collective agency in Kosovo. The most common graffiti was a cross with the Cyrillic C in each corner (Figures 3.6 and 3.8). This cross, a Serbian national symbol, was used by Serbs in Kosovo during the 1998‚Äî99 war to identify their homes and apartments to Serb military and paramilitary forces; identified as such, these properties were marked as Serb-occupied so that military and paramilitary forces passed over them as they moved through towns and cities to expel Kosovar Albanians. Yet these forces often graffitied this same symbol on mosques, appropriating a representation of ethnic identity and ethnic space and inscribing it on a representation of ethnic alterity.\\" In an in depth survey conducted by Physicians for Human Rights of Kosovo Albanian refugees, it found they were often not present to see the destruction of Islamic architecture due to their flight. These events were also corroborated in reports by human rights organisations regarding the activities of Yugoslav Serb forces and their intended victims being limited in seeing such destruction.. \\"Though widespread, most violence against mosques and Islamic architecture occurred after the populations who used those buildings had been expelled from their villages, towns, and cities. In the most comprehensive survey of Kosovar refugees, for examples, less than half of respondents reported seeing mosques or other places of worship attacked. [18] Reports by human rights organizations on the actions of Serb forces during the counterinsurgency also corroborate the limited visibility of violence against religious sites to their intended victims. The initial audience of violence against putative ethnic ‚Äúsigns‚Äù or ‚Äúsymbols,‚Äù that is, was composed of the authors of that violence. Considered instrumentally, violence against architecture is understood to intend the eradication of its targets.\\"; p.168. [18].\\"Physicians for Human Rights\\" There were in some cases eyewitnesses to these attacks on historic monuments. Mosque with minaret top blown off in Sk√´nderaj, Kosovo 1999 Vandalisation of Kosovo Albanian Catholic churches also occurred. The Catholic Church of St Anthony located in Gjakov√´ had major damage done by Yugoslav Serb soldiers. In Prishtin√´, Yugoslav Serb officers ejected nuns and a priest from the Catholic church of St. Anthony and installed aircraft radar in the steeple which resulted in NATO bombing of the church and surrounding houses.. \\"Elsewhere in Gjakova, the Axhize Baba Bektashi teqe, the largest and oldest in the city, was burned in May, with the loss of 2,000 rare books and more than 250 manuscripts, including a 12th century manuscript in Persian. One of the Bektashis told Riedlmayer, \\"Five hundred years of Bektashi history and culture in this area perished in the ... roof collapsed, and the library of the Atik medresa was burned, with 2,000 books and around 100 manuscripts destroyed. Riedlmayer also found sites where all that remained of mosques were bulldozed, empty lots. Albanian Catholic churches were also vandalized. Riedlmayer learned that Serb officers had installed anti-aircraft radar in the steeple of St. Anthony's Catholic church in Prishtina, after ejecting the priest and nuns; NATO bombing of the radar, and therefore the church and surrounding houses, would have been labelled an atrocity.\\" Additionally 500 or 90 percent of kulla dwellings belonging to prominent Albanian families along with historic bazaars were targeted; where three out of four well preserved Ottoman period urban centres located in Kosovo cities being badly damaged resulting in great loss of traditional architecture.. \\"Serb forces initiated a counterinsurgency campaign in March 1998, directed against the KLA and Kosovo‚Äôs ethnic Albanian population. In this campaign, as large numbers of Kosovo‚Äôs Albanian population were forcibly deported from their homes, the historic architecture associated with that population was systematically targeted for destruction. This targeting took place both as groups of people were being expelled from their places of residence, apparently to diminish these people‚Äôs incentive to return to their hometowns and villages, but also after expulsions took place, apparently to remove visible evidence of Kosovo‚Äôs deported Albanian community. The primary buildings singled out, by Serb forces for destruction in 1998 and 1999 were mosques; at least 207 of the approximately 609 mosques in Kosovo sustained damage or were destroyed in that period. Other architectural targets of Serb forces were Islamic religious schools and libraries, more than 500 kullas (traditional stone mansions, often associated with prominent Albanian families), and historic bazaars. Three out of four well-preserved Ottoman-era urban cores in Kosovo cities were also severely damaged, in each case with great loss of historic architecture.\\" The targeted architecture sustained damage that was not collateral. Monuments that were destroyed and damaged were in areas often at lightly-damaged and undisturbed situations, indicating that the damage done was deliberate and not a result of architecture being caught in the crossfire of military combat. During the war (March‚ÄìJune 1999) the United Nations High Commission on Refugees (UNHCR) estimated that 70,000 homes in Kosovo were destroyed. In Kosovo, the destruction of historical architecture occurred within the context of the Serbian campaign of ethnic cleansing which followed a pattern that happened in Bosnia and was made worse, due to lessons of efficiency learned from that conflict. The destruction of non-Serbian architectural heritage was a methodical and planned component of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo.. \\"A similar propaganda war developed when the conflict expanded into Kosovo, with both sides, Serbs and Kosovars, making sweeping claims regarding the extent of deliberate damage and cultural cleansing. The Serbian government and the Serbian Orthodox Church maintain websites that go further in charging NATO air attacks with causing enormous destruction to the churches and monasteries of their religious heartland. This damage was widely reported in the media internationally. Careful post-war research by Harvard University academics Andrew Herscher and Andr√°s Riedimayer nailed many of the lies, while making an objective assessment of the very real and extensive damage to mosques, churches, archives and vernacular buildings made by forces on the ground. Two Ottoman bridges supposedly destroyed by NATO, for example, were in fact intact. Major damage to the Roman Catholic church of St Anthony in Gjakova, reportedly bombed by NATO, was actually committed by Serbian soldiers. The Memorial Museum of the League of Prizren was not destroyed by a 'NATO missile' but by Serbian police in March 1999 using rifle-propelled grenades. Although the priceless Serbian Orthodox heritage of Kosovo was damaged during the Kosovo conflict and after (and Serbia itself did indeed lose some buildings to NATO raids), it is the Muslim heritage, as in Bosnia, that was devastated by the war. A third of Kosovo‚Äôs historic mosques were destroyed or damaged, as were 90 per cent of the traditional kulla (stone tower-houses), as part of the Serbian campaign of ethnic cleansing that followed the pattern set in Bosnia, and made worse by the efficiency lessons learned there. The destruction of Kosovo's non-Serb architectural heritage was a planned and methodical element of ethnic cleansing.\\" Harvard University scholars Andrew Herscher and Andr√°s Riedlmayer note that the destruction of individual homes and properties in addition to historic architecture signified that the entire Kosovo Albanian population was targeted as a culturally defined entity during the conflict.. \\"The damage sustained by these buildings was not collateral. Damaged and destroyed monuments were often situated in undisturbed or lightly-damaged contexts, and the types of damage which monuments received (buildings burned from the interior, minarets of mosques toppled with explosives, anti-Islamic and anti-Albanian vandalism) indicate that this damage was deliberate, rather than the result of monuments being caught in the cross-fire of military operations. In a number of cases, eyewitnesses have also been able to precisely describe attacks on historic monuments. While the United Nations High Commission on Refugees has estimated that 70,000 homes were destroyed in Kosovo from March to June 1999, the destruction of historic architecture has a unique significance in that it signifies the attempt to target not just the homes and properties of individual members of Kosovo‚Äôs Albanian population, but that entire population as a culturally defined entity.\\"  Legacy  In the aftermath of the Kosovo war (1999) reports from journalists and refugees about the destruction of Kosovo cultural heritage emerged and a need to investigate those allegations and to document damage arose. The United Nations (UN) established a civil administration in Kosovo however one of its agencies the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) that deals with cultural heritage issues had no plans to undertake such an examination. Andrew Herscher and Andras Riedlmayer instead conducted research, raised funds and 3 months after the 1999 war ended went in October to Kosovo and documented damage done to cultural heritage institutions and buildings. With the conclusion of the field survey, their findings and documentation were placed into a database, a final report was written with copies given to the Department of Culture of the UN Mission in Kosovo and the Office of the Prosecutor presiding over the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague. \\"Reports by journalists and refugees during the Kosovo war, indicating that the destruction of cultural heritage that had accompanied ethnic cleansing in Croatia and Bosnia during the wars of the early 1990s was now happening again in Kosovo, suggested the need for a systematic postwar field survey to examine allegations and to document the damage. As the United Nations was taking over civil administration of the territory, it seemed logical that UNESCO would conduct such a survey. But inquiries with UNESCO headquarters in Paris revealed that the international body had no such plans. In the end, it seemed like the only way to make such a survey happen was to do it on one‚Äôs own. After raising the requisite funds and doing a considerable amount of library research, I went to Kosovo in October 1999, three months after the end of the war, in the company of architect Andrew Herscher, to document damage to cultural heritage buildings and institutions (Herscher & Riedlmayer, 2001). After completing our field survey, we consolidated our findings and documentation into a database and wrote up a final report, copies of which were presented to the Department of Culture of the UN Mission in Kosovo and to the Office of the Prosecutor of the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague.\\"  Trial of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá  In the trial of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá (2002-2006), Yugoslav Serb president during the Kosovo war (1999), the ICTY indictment against him referred to methods of persecution done against Kosovo Albanians to \\"wreak systematic and wanton destruction and damage to their religious sites and cultural monuments\\". The prosecution in the trial sought to prove Milo≈°eviƒá guilty of those actions and events.. \\"One of the methods used to persecute the Kosovar population was to wreak systematic and wanton destruction and damage to their religious sites and cultural monuments, according to the indictment. Such destruction committed on political, racial, or religious grounds is a crime against humanity. Through the testimony of Andras Riedlmayer, an international expert on the Balkan cultural heritage of the Ottoman era, the prosecution sought to prove Milosevic guilty of it.\\" In his defense, Milo≈°eviƒá asserted that Kosovo Albanian heritage sites, in addition to Serb Orthodox historical and religious monuments were damaged by NATO bombing. Yugoslav Serb authorities in several cases alleged that NATO destroyed monuments, however the investigative team led by Andr√°s Riedlmayer found them intact like two Ottoman bridges and the Sinan Pasha Mosque. Investigators absolved NATO of responsibility except for damage to a village mosque roof and a disused Catholic church damaged through an air blast after an nearby army base was struck by a missile. Riedlmayer's report to the trial concluded that kulla dwellings and a third of mosques were subjected to damage and destruction, with three Ottoman period urban centres being devastated due to intentionally lit fires. The report also noted that the Yugoslav Serb army, paramilitary and police forces and in some instances Serb civilians did those attacks, according to eyewitness accounts. Riedlmayer found out that Yugoslav Serb forces used as bases of operation two Catholic churches which in international law was prohibited. The investigative team noted that destruction and damage of Kosovo Albanian heritage sites were done during the 1999 war through ground attack and not air strikes. \\"Riedlmayer, associated with Harvard University, provided a report of his investigations of war damage to cultural and religious sites in Kosova. Based on a two-year study that he undertook with the architect and Balkan specialist Andrew Herscher between July 1999 and the summer of 2001, sponsored by Harvard‚Äôs Center for Middle Eastern Studies, the report concluded that three out of four urban centers dating to the Ottoman years were devastated as a result of intentionally set fires. Serbian police, army troops, paramilitaries, and in some cases Serb civilians perpetrated these attacks, according to eyewitnesses. In addition, traditional Albanian residential buildings, called kullas, were targeted for destruction. Over one-third of all mosques in Kosova were damaged or destroyed. While Milosevic asserted that NATO bombardment was responsible for damage to Kosova Albanian heritage sites as well as for damage and destruction to Serbian Orthodox religious and historical monuments, Riedlmayer‚Äôs study absolved NATO of responsibility for all but damage to the roof of one village mosque and to a disused Catholic church, damaged by an air blast during a missile strike on a nearby army base. In several cases where Serb authorities alleged complete destruction of monuments by NATO (such as the Sinan Pasha Mosque and two Ottoman bridges), investigators found the monuments completely intact. Riedlmayer described how investigators reached their conclusions that damage was not caused by air strikes.... Throughout the province Riedlmayer and his co-investigators found damage and destruction of Kosova Albanian cultural heritage sites from ground attack during the war and what appeared to be Kosovar attacks against Serbian cultural heritage sites after the war. He also learned that Serbian forces used two Catholic churches as bases of operation, which was prohibited by international law. Riedlmayer later testified to similar destruction of Islamic religious and cultural sites during the Bosnian war.\\" With weeks left before the conclusion of the trial, no verdict was reached due to Milo≈°eviƒá's death in March, 2006.  Post war Kosovo  Old Bazaar in Gjakova, 1999 Destruction of multiple Serbian churches occurred in a post-conflict environment done by members of the Albanian community, who viewed that architectural heritage as a surrogate for revenge against the Milo≈°eviƒá government and its military forces for violence committed during the Kosovo conflict (1998-1999)..\\"Part III examines the destruction of architectural surrogates of unavenged violence in postwar Kosovo. After the 1998‚Äî99 war, calls for retribution for prior violence inflicted by Serb forces against Kosovar Albanians circulated through Kosovar Albanian public culture. The postconflict destruction of Serbian Orthodox churches and monasteries was narrated as a form of this retribution, with architecture becoming a surrogate for the agencies deemed responsible for the violence to be avenged‚Äîinitially the Milo≈°eviƒá regime and its military forces. The fabrication of architecture as a surrogate for unavenged violence, however, not only mediated an already constituted concept of violence but also ramified on that concept; the destruction of churches and monasteries represented not only revenge for the violence of the 1998‚Äî99 war but also a continuous sequence of actual or imagined violent acts stretching back to the medieval construction of churches on crypto-Albanian religious sites. The destruction of architectural surrogates of violence thereby elicited a potentially endless justification for destruction rather than a politics of justice.\\" The Serbian government has used such attacks as a basis to petition the United Nations to allow its police and armed forces to return and guard historical monuments in Kosovo. The petition did not succeed however, and the post-conflict attacks on Serbian cultural heritage have been used by Serbian cultural institutions to deflect focus from attacks on Albanian cultural heritage done during the war. Those institutions reported upon the post- conflict damage done toward Orthodox Serbian heritage and produced reports that have been accepted by international cultural heritage institutions as neutral and objective assessments. Little awareness or concern has appeared for the cultural heritage belonging to Kosovo Albanians that was damaged during the war. The Serbian government only once officially acknowledged that Albanian cultural heritage had been damaged within the context of an assessment of NATO war crimes, that also entailed the aerial bombing of several Albanian historical monuments.. \\"The Serbian government has used these attacks as the basis to petition the United Nations to allow the return of its troops and police to Kosovo to guard historic monuments. While this petition was unsuccessful, the postwar attack on Serbian cultural heritage has been appropriated by Serbian cultural institutions as a means to deflect attention from the assault on Albanian cultural heritage that preceded it. These institutions have reported only on the postwar damage sustained by Serbian Orthodox heritage and these reports have been regarded as neutral and objective assessments by international cultural heritage institutions. As a result, there has been little awareness of or concern for the damaged cultural heritage of Kosovo‚Äôs Albanian majority. The only official acknowledgment by the Serbian government that damage was done to Albanian cultural heritage in Kosovo was made in the frame of an assessment of NATO war crimes, which ostensibly included the aerial bombardment of several Albanian historic monuments.\\" Meagre legal attention toward severely damaged Islamic heritage has occurred apart from the ICTY's documentation of destroyed and damaged Kosovo mosques. There has been a reluctance to acknowledge damage done toward Albanian cultural heritage in Kosovo by the international community. The international community has viewed its mission in Kosovo as a humanitarian one to provide for Kosovo's populace and the issue of damaged cultural heritage has been sidelined toward focus on Kosovo's \\"reconstruction\\".. \\"The international community in Kosovo has also been reluctant to acknowledge the damage that was done to Albanian cultural heritage in Kosovo. The initial UNESCO report on the state of cultural heritage in Kosovo after the war was based primarily on information supplied by Serbian cultural heritage institutions. More generally, however, the international community has conceived of its mission in Kosovo as simply a humanitarian triage to provide for the basic needs of Kosovo‚Äôs ravaged postwar population, a population which is dealt with less as peoples with distinct and valuable cultural heritages than as generic refugees. As some commentators have pointed out, the NATO intervention in Kosovo was based on an ideology of victimization: ‚Äúwhen NATO intervened to protect Kosovar victims, it ensured at the same time that they would remain victims, inhabitants of a devastated country with a passive population.‚Äù The same ideology also underlays the bracketing-off of cultural heritage from what is called the ‚Äúreconstruction‚Äù of Kosovo.\\" The Islamic Community of Kosovo since 1999 has through funding from various sources been engaged in the reconstruction of 113 damaged mosques from the Kosovo conflict.. In all, some 211 mosques damaged due to the Kosovo conflict have been reconstructed through contributions from donors and local communities, non-governmental agencies and foreign governments such as assistance from some Muslim countries, in particular Turkey and Arab states.. Islamic charities entered Kosovo and rebuilt Ottoman period mosques destroyed during the war in the Gulf Arab style while also being responsible for destroying centuries old religious complexes and mosques under the cover of \\"reconstruction\\". Journalists in Kosovo reported that assistance to local communities was dependent on them allowing permission for a particular Islamic charity to reconstruct local mosques. Libraries, gravestones and mausoleums which were centuries old became subject to destruction by Islamic charities as they viewed them to be \\"idolatrous\\".. Assistance from Western institutions and countries toward mosque reconstruction have occurred, such as the Italian government rebuilding two mosques in Pej√´ and Harvard University rebuilding a main mosque in Gjakov√´.. The Jews in Kosovo also funded the rebuilding of a mosque in Gjakov√´.. The protection, restoration and rebuilding of Islamic architectural monuments and heritage has not received much interest from Kosovo state authorities in contrast to architecture belonging to the Serbian Orthodox Church..

Based on the frames and boiler of GWR Hall class 4-6-0 No 4942 Maindy Hall, it is the second completed \\"new-build\\" project, based at Didcot Railway Centre in Didcot, Oxfordshire. Described as \\"building the 78th Saint\\", the project started in the 1970s to look at building a new 'Saint', since none of the original class-members were preserved.  Maindy Hall  No.4942 Maindy Hall in scrapyard condition, at Didcot in 2011 No. 4942 Maindy Hall was a 4-6-0 locomotive of the GWR's 4900 Hall class. It was built in 1929 at Swindon. After being withdrawn from service in 1963, it was moved to Woodham Brothers scrapyard in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, South Wales, in 1964 and was bought by the Didcot Railway Centre in 1974, who also bought 5900 Hinderton Hall. The Saint project Following the formation of the society in the 1970s a plan was formed to build a new 2900 Saint, since none of the original class members were preserved (the last class member being no 2920 Saint David which was withdrawn from service in October 1953 and was sent straight for scrap). It was decided to rebuild 4942 Maindy Hall from scrapyard condition (there being another ten members of the 4900 Hall class in preservation). This is appropriate as the original 4900 class prototype of 1925 was converted from 2900 class engine Saint Martin. It was also decided (like 60163 Tornado) to number the locomotive as a new member of the class, sequential to the highest- numbered original Saint, No.2998, Ernest Cunard. The original driving wheels for the Hall were in size while the size of the driving wheels for a Saint were , the front bogie wheels were also smaller than those for a Saint as they were and the front bogie wheels for a Saint were . Some of the parts used in the construction of 2999 are original Saint parts, including a connecting rod from 2906 Lady of Lynn and the whistle from 2910 Lady of Shalott. The chimney is also an original part, but is from a 6800 class 4-6-0. The engine was built in the original form, with straight frames and lever reversing gear; these engines were named after historical, mythological or poetical 'Ladies', which corresponds with the name Lady of Legend chosen for 2999. The original height of the 2900 Saints was , but the maximum height allowed for steam locomotives to work on the mainline by Network Rail is , because of overhead line clearances. The height of 2999 was therefore reduced, to allow it to operate on the mainline. Mainline operation also requires the additional equipment that none of the original members of its class had, including: AWS (A similar system called ATC was used by the GWR), TPWS, OTMR & GSM-R. A speedometer would also need to be fitted to the loco as when outshopped the locomotive wasn't fitted with one. However a later decision from Didcot regarding the ceasing of mainline running means that the engine will only see use at Didcot and on other heritage railways in the foreseeable future. Naming 2999 Many names were submitted in a competition run by the group which were constructing 2999Competition Entries and the name eventually chosen was Lady of Legend. Other names that were submitted in the competition to name the new engine included: Lady in Waiting, Lady Diana, Lady of Lourdes, Saint Dai, Maindy Court (reference to donor loco 4942 Maindy Hall), Prince Charles, John Betjeman & Phoenix. Atlantic option An integral part of the Saint project is the 'Atlantic option'. Although it is intended by the Saint project that the completed engine will run primarily in its 4-6-0 configuration as a Saint because of the plan to go mainline, it is planned to have the engine run for a period during its 10-year boiler certification as a 4-4-2 Atlantic.

Designed to support Operation Crusader, a decoy convoy, GM 3, was assembled, in an attempt to divert Axis aircraft away from the land battle. Five merchantmen, the oiler Brown Ranger, a sloop, a destroyer, and three corvettes left Gibraltar on 16 November 1941. The freighters were to turn back after dark and return independently while the escort conducted a two day anti- submarine sweep. One corvette had engine trouble, sailed late and sank a German U-boat. Force K contributed to the deception by sailing westwards from Malta to simulate a rendezvous with GM 3, then reversing course overnight. A second diversion force, as Operation Landmark, left Malta early on 21 November, feigning a voyage to Alexandria to escort four merchant ships. For added verisimilitude, the battle squadron at Alexandria sailed as if to meet the ships from Malta.

She was also a founder of Cabrini College in Radnor, Pennsylvania, and the first chairman of its English department.  Biography   Early life and education  Rose Basile was born on December 19, 1914, in New Rochelle, New York, the daughter of Salvatore and Carolina Galgano Basile. Her father's family migrated to the United States from the town of Calitri in southern Italy. She grew up on a farm in Harwinton, Connecticut, where she and her siblings went to school in a one-room schoolhouse. She received a B.A. in English from the College of New Rochelle in 1935, an M.A. in Italian studies from Columbia University in 1941, and a Ph.D. in American civilization from the University of Pennsylvania in 1962.  Career  After earning her B.A., she spent a year in Torrington, Connecticut, working for the Works Progress Administration's Federal Writers' Project. Afterwards she remained in the area for six more years, teaching English and Italian at Torrington High School and dramatics in the night school program.

The company was split in 1973 with its defense related businesses becoming Eurometaal and its civilian manufacturing becoming Hembrug Machine Tools. During its years of operation as Artillerie Inrichtingen, the company manufactured armaments and an array of other industrial outputs for the Dutch Army and the Royal Dutch East Indies Army (KNIL). History 17th Century Delft, Netherlands The tribulations of the year 1672 emphasized the neglected state in which the army of the Republic of the Seven Provinces found itself. Therefore, in 1677, Willem III of Orange founded the corps artillery. In 1679 the State Prosecution Company in Delft was established. It was not the only one in the Netherlands. For example, the Grof Geschut Gieterijin in The Hague and the Geweerfabriek in Culemborg were also known. With the creation of United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815 following the Napoleonic Wars and the period of French Occupation, there was a need for a strong army in order to provide a buffer against France. The artillery was improved under the direction of Prince Frederik. Arms production was reorganized and came under military leadership. The Delft Company The Battle of Waterloo, 1815 In the period of peace between Waterloo in 1815 and the Belgian Revolution of 1830, the Delft company developed rapidly. By 1813, the company was already utilizing steam power and producing artillery, field guns, small arms and military vehicles. Other products were manufactured in facilities located in Li√®ge, but this ended after 1830 when the Belgian Revolution geographically split off these facilities, leaving the company's production entirely in Delft. Again, a reorganization was undertaken and non-core tasks such as woodworking were rejected. The company focused its efforts on metalworking under the leadership of Colonel Ultich Huguenin (1755-1833). The company began to manufacture small arms and ammunition as well, while continuing to produce machinery and precision instruments. Because it was also a mining plant, lathes were required for the machining of artillery munitions and the like. Their manufacture of precision instruments required custom machines and, by 1836, the company was producing lathes for their own use. By about 1850 there were 500 people in the company. The quality of production was high. In 1860 a pyrotechnic plant was set up for the manufacture of explosives. About 1880, the company consisted of a logistics center, a pyrotechnic school, a foundry, a workshop, a saddlery, a woodworking center, a gun shop, and a pattern factory. In 1884, the company introduced a small foundry for cast steel, which was the first industrial scale steel production in the Netherlands. With this addition, the company began using cast steel for the production of war materiels which were previously manufactured from cast iron or wrought iron. The Hembrug Company Artillerie Inrichtingen workers at the Hembrug plant use lathes to turn projectiles in the production of 75mm naval artillery shells Zaandam, Netherlands, 1912. 70MM Cannon Production, 1921. Rifle stock production. Zaandam, Netherlands, 1912. In 1887 the company was renamed Artillerie Inrichtingen (A.I.). From this point, all production was no longer centered in Delft because the Hague Grove Geschut Gieterij was also included in the company. As the company's existing facilities had no space left to expand, a new site was sought. However, this search was limited to the territory within the defenses of The Stelling van Amsterdam. The company chose a new base of operations near Zaandam, where there were already some naval pilots[translation from Dutch article needed]. In 1899, Artillerie Inrichtingen moved to the Hemelveld on the Noordzeekanaal near Zaandam. The Hague shuttles were closed in 1904 and the services moved to Zaandam. In 1907, a gangway bridge was opened over the canal called Hembrug. Eventually the name of the bridge would pass on the company. In 1912, Artillerie Inrichtingen was re-designated as a state-owned company, and was thereby withdrawn from the direct military authority. At this time, the company employed some 1200 people, including many soldiers. Most of its production was then going to the Dutch East Indies to suppress rebellions of the indigenous peoples, such as those the Aceh Wars. After the outbreak of the First World War, production and staff increased quickly, reaching a height of 8500 people in 1917. Arms production increased by the large orders for the Dutch army. After the end of the war, the country entered a period of disarmament with the establishment of the League of Nations. The number of employees fell to less than 2000 in 1921 and closure of the company was considered. As an alternative, automobiles were assembled and converted. The company also employed 200 drivers delivered mail, until this function was transferred to the \\"Mailies\\" of the Dutch National Postal Service in 1930. In 1928, the organizational form of the company was changed to that of a public limited company which allowed for greater freedom of business management. The largest customer was still the KNIL, and the number of employees slowly recovered, before later falling back to 1200 in 1932 during the Depression, despite an increasing demand for the company's civilian production, including lathes. The German re-armament of the 1930s also led to increases in production. In 1940, a plan was put in place to deny the NAZIs use of Artillerie Inrichtingen's facilities, but this plan was not implemented before The Invasion. World War II Wartime Dutch NSB Rally upright=0.6 During the German occupation of the Netherlands, Frans den Hollander remained Director of Artillerie Inrichtingen, but he had contact with the Dutch government in exile. The Nazi's demanded immediate reopening of the factories following the surrender of the Netherlands, but Den Hollander and his superiors, Dutch Commander-in-chief Henri Winkelman and Secretary- General Cornelis Ringeling refused this initially, and succeeded in delaying the resumption of production for about a month. On June 20, 1940 production resumed. The Nazis kept the plants working during the war, but the workforce fell sharply. The company also tried to make as many civilian products as possible. This could be because the machine factory was sold in 1941. The Delft factory was also dismantled in secret in 1941. In 1944, when the Allies began to advance through The Low Countries and through the Hunger Winter the Artillerie-Inrichtingen factories were closed. Post War ArmaLite AR-10 with mounted bayonet made by Artillerie Inrichtingen (A.I.) Portuguese P√°raquedistas armed with Artillerie Inrichtingen produced AR-10 rifles during the Angolan War of 1961-1974. After the Liberation in 1945, the company was restarted. The company, with the support of the Marshall Plan, produced agricultural tools such as seed and weeding machines and potato sorting machines for the post-war mechanization of Dutch agriculture. Thanks to the war in Dutch-India and The Cold War, there also remained a high demand for the company's ammunition and weapons production. It was during this time that the company became involved in the manufacture of AR-10 Battle Rifles for the Dutch, Portuguese, and Sudanese armies. This iconic rifle is the predecessor or the M16/M4/AR-15 series rifles, one of the world's most prolific assault rifle designs. The AR-10 was adopted by the Portuguese Paratroopers and came to be an iconic symbol of the Angolan War of Independence and the broader Portuguese Colonial Wars. The company also continued its long-standing production of lathes which led to numerous innovations. With the introduction of CNC Machining, the company's lathe making arm specialized in precision lathes from 1969 and went on to eventually become the Mikroturn division of Hembrug Machine Tools. Eurometaal Headquarters 1973 Split In 1973 the Dutch government divided the company into two independent parts: Eurometaal, and Hembrug Machine Tools. Eurometaal took the company's military production facilities including those for arms and armaments, while Hembrug took the precision tool manufacturing. In 1983, the privatization of Hembrug followed the company moving to the Figeeweg in the Waarderpolder in Haarlem. Hembrug went on to develop ultra-precision lathes. Eurometaal also sought to target the civil market and manufactured parts for cars, forklifts, milking robots, high-precision precision tools, light commercials, sailboats, and durable locks. It also developed a press for the production of coins for the Dutch Mint, which struck guilders and later euro coins. A unique technical event was the acquisition of a 3000-ton soil pump, which was the largest in Europe in terms of capacity and stroke length. Acquisition and repatriation Rheinmetall Eurometaal was eventually taken over by the German Rheinmetall and stopped production in 2003. The Eurometaal subsidiary at Bergen op Zoom, called Franerex, was also closed in 2003. Companies in Eurometaal Holding including Intergas at Coevorden and the German Heidel, which worked for the automotive industry, were rejected for a social plan for the last 200 employees. In the old mansion workshop at Zaandam, the Tetrix training center was established in the old Artillerie Inrichtingen masonry pattern factory, founded in 1939. They left the site in 2012. Present Production in the Hembrug area declined through the 1970s until the train stop serving it shut down in 1982. The old Artillerie Inrichtingen Hembrug factories fell into disuse. In 1983, the Hembrug Bridge, for which the area was named, was made obsolete by the Hemtunnel, then torn down in 1985. The former munitions factories were replaced by Eurometaal, then Rhinemetall facilities. As of 2017, the Hembrug Machine Tools company still makes precision lathes including the Mikroturn line in Haarlem. There are still a large number of industrial manufacturing plants in the Hembrug area, and the area is considered as an important industrial monument. On the site of the old Artillerie Inrichtingen Hemburg factories, the Hembrug Museum is furnished to provide information about the past, present and future of its activities. Association with the AR-10 battle rifle Artillerie Inrichtingen produced Sudanese AR-10 On July 4, 1957, Fairchild ArmaLite sold a five-year manufacturing license for the AR-10 to Artillerie Inrichtingen. The AR-10 was invented by Eugene Stoner in 1955 as a late entrant to the United States Army's Light Rifle Trials to replace the M1 Garand in US service. It was a revolutionary design in many ways, but lost the competition. It had however caught the interest of Foreign militaries which led to Armalite's deal with Artillerie Inrichtingen whose large factory and production facilities were felt could produce the ArmaLite rifle in the large quantities Fairchild anticipated would be needed to fulfill expected orders. A.I. officials meanwhile discovered a number of manufacturing and production issues in the \\"Hollywood\\" (Armalite) version of the AR-10, all of which had to be resolved before large-scale production could commence.Pikula. pp. 46, 50. In addition to designing and building tooling for the rifle, the design had to be converted to metric dimensions and subcontractors had to be found to supply materials or manufacture component parts.Pikula. pg. 50. ArmaLite also continued to send A.I. product improvement requests. AR-10 production was limited, though Guatemala,Pikula. pg. 45 Burma, Italy, Cuba, Sudan and Portugal all purchased AR-10 rifles for limited issue to their military forcesPikula. pp. 72-73.Pikula. pg. 78.Pikula. pg. 75. with examples eventually turning up in unofficial service with various African and colonial armies, police, and guerrilla forces.Pikula. pg. 81. The AR-10 remained in service with Sudanese Special Forces until 1985. Portuguese p√°raquedistas armed with AR-10 rifles disembark from an Alouette III helicopter during the Angolan War of 1961-1974. The final Artillerie Inrichtingen design is known as the Portuguese model AR-10. It is believed that approximately 4,000-5,000 Portuguese variants were produced; nearly all of them were sold to the Portuguese National Defense Ministry by the Brussels- based arms dealer SIDEM International in 1960. The AR-10 was officially adopted by the Portuguese Paratrooper Battalions (Ca√ßadores p√°raquedistas), and the rifle saw considerable combat service in Portugal's counter-insurgency campaigns in Angola and Mozambique. Additional sales of the AR-10 rifle were stymied after the Netherlands embargoed further shipments of the rifle to Portugal. The A.I. produced Portuguese AR-10s continued in service with a few Portuguese airborne units, and was in use as late as 1975 in the Portuguese Timor (East Timor) decolonization emergency. Fairchild-ArmaLite was dissatisfied with the delays in setting up the tooling and production at A.I. for the AR-10, and made it clear that they would not be renewing A.I.'s license to produce the rifle. By 1960, hampered by Dutch export restrictions and discouraged by the lack of arms sales to major national purchasers, Artillerie Inrichtingen decided to exit the small arms production business altogether, and ceased all production of the AR-10 under its license from Fairchild-ArmaLite. By that time, fewer than 10,000 AR-10s had been produced, mostly military select-fire rifles, with a few semi-automatic only rifles produced for civilian use. All A.I. AR-10 parts inventories, tooling, and prototypes were either sold or scrapped; the barrel tooling was sold to Israel sometime in the early 1960s. All AR-10 production records, design drawings, manuals, literature, and other publications then in inventory were discarded.Pikula. pp. 88-90.

For Hamed, it was his third consecutive opponent to have been a world champion. Prior to the bout, Hamed began having problems with his lifelong trainer Brendan Ingle stemming from unflattering comments Ingle had made about Hamed in Ingle's book \\"The Paddy and the Prince.\\" Hamed lashed out at Ingle in an interview prior to the fight, labeling Ingle a \\"Judas\\" and claiming that he had \\"brainwashed\\" him.

In 1966, Ong ran for the Arizona State Senate and succeeded, becoming the first Chinese-American to enter the State Legislature. Early years Ong (birth name: Ong Yut Ning) was born in Canton, Guangdong, China to Ong Dao Lung, a United States born Chinese-American and Wong Shee. The family was going through a difficult economic situation and young Ong began his formal education sitting under a tree with the other boys in his native village. Ong found work as a cabin boy where he helped the cook in the ship's kitchen and carried buckets of food from the ship's kitchen to the forecastle where the ordinary seamen ate.New York Times Dec. 21, 1977Phoenix New Times: THE ONG DYNASTYGROWING UP CHINESE-AMERICANAchievements of Chinese- Americans in Arizona HistoryCumulative notes for the Z≈çon Politikon In 1919, he arrived in the United States via California's Angel Island in San Francisco. The fourteen-year-old young man was incarcerated for three months while authorities double-checked his United States citizenship. Life in Phoenix Ong lived in California during an era when California law excluded children from segregated schools if they didn't already know English. In 1920 he moved to Phoenix and went to live with the family of his uncle Henry Ong Sr. He entered first grade at Grant Elementary School. In four years he completed elementary school and two years later graduated from Phoenix Union High School. He was employed by Arizona Governor Thomas E. Campbell as a houseboy during his high school years. Ong joined his uncle and cousins in the family business. However, his true passion was to become a lawyer someday. In 1927, his uncle, Henry, arranged a traditional Chinese marriage to sixteen- year-old Rose Wong, a girl who Ong had never met. His first encounter with his future wife was the same day that she arrived from China. The arranged wedding required a pact between both participants. He promised to help her brother and sister immigrate to the United States and she promised to support him in his goal to become a lawyer. In 1938, Ong, together with his uncle Henry and various Chinese-American merchants formed the Chinese Chamber of Commerce to protect and promote their businesses.Historic Properties Survey University of Arizona Soon Ong established his own store at 1246 East Jefferson Street. He kept his promise and his brother-in-law and sister-in-law immigrated to the U.S.. His first child was born in back of the grocery store where he worked and lived. Ong enrolled in the University of Arizona in Tucson and studied law. One of his classmates was future U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater. His wife and in-laws ran the store while he attended law school. The Campbells were so impressed by Ong when he worked for them that they helped him economically through law school. In 1943, he graduated at the top of his law class and became an immigration attorney. At the time he was one of only eight Chinese- American lawyers in the U.S.. Ong set up a storefront law office next to his grocery store, the Wing F. Ong Grocery Store at 1246 East Jefferson Street. Politics In 1944, Ong ran for the Arizona House of Representatives and lost by 17 votes. He continued his law practice and in 1946, ran for the State House of Representatives as a Democrat and was elected. He thus became the first Chinese American in the United States to be elected to a state legislative body. His campaign slogan was: He served two terms from 1946 to 1950 in said political position. As state representative, he backed welfare, education and job-security measures for those less fortunate. Grave-site of Wing Foon Ong As an immigration attorney Ong continued to help other Chinese immigrants from San Francisco who were facing the same difficulties and discrimination that he faced during his own immigration process. He practiced law for a short period of time in San Francisco, and in 1956, returned to Phoenix with his family. Ong then established a Chinese restaurant which he named \\"Wing's Restaurant\\" at 1617 E. Thomas Road. He established his law office on the second floor of the restaurant. In 1965, Arizona Governor Sam Goddard appointed Ong as goodwill ambassador to China. In 1966, he ran for the State Senate of Arizona and was elected, becoming the first Chinese-American who entered the State Legislature. He served one term from 1966 to 1968 in said position. Later years Ong purchased a new house at 2702 N. 7th Street. He returned to his law practice after he retired from politics. On December 19, 1977, he died at age 73 in Phoenix. He is buried in Phoenix's Greenwood/Memory Lawn Mortuary & Cemetery. Further reading *\\"Contemporary Immigration in America: A State-by-State Encyclopedia (2 volumes)\\"; By Kathleen R.

It is an international collaboration of major libraries and collections including the British Library, Biblioth√®que nationale de France, Martin Sch√∏yen Collection, Bavarian State Library, Harvard, Yale and the Vatican. It is based in Switzerland and the project's current director is Professor Christoph Fl√ºeler from the University of Fribourg and the Virtual Manuscript Library, Switzerland. Florus de Lyon fragment, Biblioth√®que de Gen√®ve, Ms. lat. 16 History The Fragmentarium project was first proposed in October 2013 and the first planning meeting took place in Cologny in 2014. It was supported initially by representatives of 12 institutions, its goal being to study the field of manuscript fragment research and look at worldwide cataloguing standards. Fragmentarium was officially launched on 1 September 2017, by the Medieval Institute of the University of Fribourg at Abbey Library of St. Gall in St. Gallen, Switzerland. Historians and librarians are now able to upload images to the Fragmentarium where they will be made available for research and encouraged to publish images under a Creative Commons public domain license. The library currently operates as a closed system and will open up public resources gradually from 2018. Method Multispectral image of palimpsest fragments Or. 6581 with infrared (middle) and ultraviolet (right) Enhanced multispectral imaging of palimpsest fragments composite images Fragmentarium follows an established Swiss codex digitisation system known as e-codices and aims to promote cooperative research and discussion between researchers and scholars from multiple institutions. As more fragments are uploaded it will be possible to reunite fragments which have become separated and compare analyses of similar manuscript pieces. Some fragments have been analysed using the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) to identify pigments, creating a unique \\"fingerprint\\" to enable it to be matched to corresponding fragments elsewhere in the world and potentially track their journey with ‚Äúthe potential to learn more about trade routes, historic mining sites, and the regional use of pigments and ingredients‚Äù. Other fragments have been identified as \\"recycled\\" into covers or bindings for later documents, a practice which was prevalent in the 15th to 17th century. The system is also useful in documenting and digitally preserving partial manuscripts which have been damaged by neglect or fire as in the Cotton library fire of 1731, or by deliberate destruction as occurred in the reformation in Scandinavia. In more recent times, in the 1950s and 1960s medieval manuscripts were frequently deliberately divided in order to attract a higher return on resale values and have subsequently become lost to researchers: Fragmentarium hopes to reunite them. Fl√ºeler has estimated that around 90% of extant fragments are currently \\"lost\\" in archives. In 2018 Fragmentarium published Fragmentology, described as a journal for the study of medieval manuscript fragments. Access to the library is free of charge.

At the same time Lieutenant general Paul Methuen was tasked with clearing the country along the Vaal River on the Boers' flank and to drive towards Mafeking, which was still besieged.Mace & Grehan p.176 On 5 April Methuen ordered Brigadier-General Lord Chesham, with the Kimberley Mounted Corps and 4th Battery RFA. From an informer they found intelligence on a Boer Commando unit led by a French volunteer, the Comte de Villebois- Mareuil. Methuen was given information that the Boer unit intended to attack the British at Boshof near Tweefontein. The newly formed Imperial Yeomanry 3rd and 10th battalions, was given the task to surround the Boers. De Villebois- Mareuil, was in charge of the French legion volunteers which had 75 foreign volunteers most of whom were of the French but included a number of German, Dutch, Americans and one Russian Prince.Miller pp 184-6. Battle 15 pounder field gun at a camp near Boshof, 1900 De Villebois-Mareuil's force lay on two small hills (or Kopjes) - the foreign volunteers on one and the Boers on the other.Bennett pp. 10-04 By 3pm the British force were setting up positions around the hills. A bombardment by four 15 pounder guns then commenced, along with suppressing fire by a Maxim machine gun.Macnab pp. 198-202 As the yeomanry prepared to close with the bayonet, the Boers on the hill saw that they were being outflanked and asked De Villebois-Mareuil to withdraw but he flatly refused. He was hoping for a thunderstorm which was coming their way to aid him. The pounding increased the casualties and the Boers saw the hopelessness of the situation - they mounted their horses and fought their way out. De Villebois-Mareuil and the French were left to attempt to make a gallant but futile last stand. The Kimberley Mounted Corps crept up on the right and the rest of the Yeomen dismounted and did the same on the left. Both sides were close and the British artillery had to be careful when firing in order not to hit their own men. Some of the French tried to escape by mounting horses but were all taken down easily in a hail of rifle fire. Still the rest refused to surrender. Nevertheless, the Yeomanry took advantage and moved through the bushes and boulders around the hills. They slowly crept up ever closer, and casualties were light. Within a few hours of fighting De Villebois-Mareuil was killed by a shell and morale sank amongst the volunteers. Seeing the panic the Yeomanry now only within fifteen yards of the fortified positions fixed bayonets and charged. Statue du colonel de Villebois-Mareuil in Nantes By 6pm with darkness having approached the volunteers waved a white flag and the surviving volunteers surrendered. The thunderstorm that could have covered their retreat then came across the battlefield. The battle lasted only three hours - in all eleven of the volunteers were killed, the rest were wounded and captured. De Villebois- Mareuil's Aide-de-camp Comt√© Pierre de Br√©da was captured and was treated with chivalry by Methuan. In addition Prince Bagratian of Tiflis, a Russian volunteer was killed. British losses were three killed and ten wounded. Aftermath One week after his death the Boer Foreign Legion was disbanded and placed under General De la Rey to continue with the Guerilla Phase of the War. The battle was the first time that the Imperial Horse Yeomanry had fought and was also their first victory. British troops buried De Villebois-Mareuil with full military honours. A mass was arranged by the Ligue de la patrie fran√ßaise which was held in his honour at the Notre Dame de Paris which 10,000 people attended. De Villebois-Mareuil's horse was taken to Britain by Lord Chesham, where it lived until February 1911. A monument was later erected on the Farm Middelkuil, ten kilometres East of Boshof, where the battle took place, to commemorate battle.

Her father and husband are only referred to as \\"laborers\\". She became the mother of the cunning woman Johanna Maria Andersson, and the grandmother of Hedda Andersson. She settled in Malm√∂ after her marriage in 1833, and established herself as a medical practitioner. As her mother before her, she specialized in the healing of wounds and fractures. In contrast to most cunning women and cunning men of her time, she did not use any magic spells during her work, which contributed to her good name as she came to be regarded more as a scientific physician. She was widely credited for her success in managing to heal severe injuries which would otherwise have caused amputations, and which educated physicians before her had failed to cure, and thus having saved many from becoming invalids. She received clients from all over South Sweden, Norway and Denmark. Her good name was sufficient enough for town- and military physicians to recommend her to patients they had failed to cure. Regardless of her ability and success, she was still practicing without a license. In 1855, she was reported for quackery by the physician August Falck. She was summoned to court in 1856, and appealed to the king for dispensation to practice with reference to her long standing experience, success and content patients. The king received numerous letters from the public in support of Elna Hansson. Women were not allowed to study medicine, but in order to solve the issue, the king issued a royal letter granting permit for women to study surgery as feldshers in 1857. Elna Hansson took the feldsher examn in Stockholm and passed. She was thus likely the first woman feldsher in Sweden. Her feldsher license allowed her to practice medicine openly, and she opened her own official clinic, with room for seven patients. She practiced until her death. Her daughter joined her practice as a widow in 1866, also with permit to practice ad a feldsher. In 1870, women were officially allowed to study medicine in Sweden. Elna Hansson and her daughter consequently decided that their granddaughter and daughter Hedda Andersson, the 7th-generation of a family of cunning women, should study medicine openly at the university and be given a medical license, to avoid the history of quackery charges which had affected the line of women medical practitioners in their family: Hedda Andersson became the second formally trained women physician in Sweden.

It guarded the northern approaches to the Empire and access to the Azov Sea.–¢–∏—Ö–æ–Ω–æ–≤, –Æ. –ê. –ê–∑–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–µ —Å–∏–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ. ‚Äî –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞, 1970. P. 99 After a series of conflicts, a peace treaty was signed in Constantinople on July 13, 1700 between the Tsardom of Russia and the Ottoman Empire. The sultan recognized Russia's possession of the Azov area. History  Origin  The site had been Venetian and Genoese colonies before the second half of the 15th century. A town named Tana served as major transit point for trafficking between West and East. Tana was occupied by the Ottoman Empire in 1471. The Ottomans founded an enormous fortress there. It consisted of a stone wall with 11 towers around a hill. The Faubourg was separated by a moat and ramparts. The fortress' garrison was armed with 200 cannons.  Cossack period  The rampart The Don and Zaporozhian Cossacks stormed the fortress in June 1637. Cossack cavalry with the strength of 400 horsemen defended the fortress from steppe side. Turkish army attempted to retake Azov in 1641. The fortress sustained heavy shelling by guns that reduced much of the fortress to rubble. Turks spent 700-1000 shells per day. The walls were completely destroyed in parts. Only three towers among 11 were spared during the battle. Forces of Ottoman Empire stormed the fortress, but they sustained heavy losses and retreated. After the gun-fire forces of Ottoman Empire organized a massive attack against the fortress. Outnumbered Turkish Army forced the cossacks to retreat to the Citadel. Siege of Azov ends due to heavy toll (20‚Äì70 thousand wounded or killed in three months) problems with Turkish army support and supply of the provisions. The Cossacks proposed the annexation of Azov by the Tsardom of Russia. Russian tsar Michael I and the zemsky sobor refused the offer because it has resulted in next Russo-Turkish war to which Russia was not ready. The cossacks did not have resources to the re—Åonstruction of the fortress. That is why blasted and desolate fortress was left in the summer of 1642. See also Bahadƒ±r I Giray.

The first attempt to storm the Azov Fortress under the command of general admiral Franz Lefort was undertaken on 5 August 1695. It was not successful. The Russian Army succeeded in occupying the watchtowers only. The number of dead and wounded Russian soldiers reached over 1500 during the storming. The second storming of the Azov fortress was undertaken on 25 September. The Lifeguard Preobrazhensky Regiment and Semyonovsky Regiment under Fyodor Apraksin occupied most of the fortifications and were able to enter the town. However Turks had time to regroup and Apraksin's advance failed without support of other army units. The siege was lifted on 2 October. The second Azov campaign was held in July 1696. The requisite preparations were completed to implement the second storming on 16 July 1696. 1,500 of the Don and Zaporozhian Cossacks invaded on 17 July. They managed to take two bastions. The garrison of the fortress surrendered on 19 July during a long period of shelling. In 1700, by concluding the Treaty of Constantinople the Ottoman Empire reaffirmed recognition of Russia's possession of the Azov fortress. The Treaty of the Pruth of 1711 stipulated the return of Azov to the Ottoman Empire. The Tsardom of Russia was forced to sign the treaty because of severe situation of its army on the banks of the river Pruth at the end of the Russo-Ottoman War of 1710‚Äì11. The surrender of Azov in 1736 The Don army (28,000 strong) under the command of imperial commander Peter Lacy besieged the fortress in 1736. Forces of Russia opened continuous artillery fire on the fortress on 11 June. Lacy gave an order to begin the storming in the night of 28/29 June. During the battle the Russian Army encountered unexpected resistance. The total Russian losses in the battle for the Azov fortress were 7 killed and 38 wounded. After the night attack Azov Pasha Mustafa Agi was invited to surrender the fortress to the Russians. Per the terms of the Treaty of Belgrade the city became part of the Russian Empire.

He is a pioneer and leading figure of copy art in Germany and not only. He founded the Museum f√ºr Fotokopie, and is the author and translator of books on the history of Copy Art and photocopiers, as well as a curator and a collector.  Biography  After completing secondary school, Klaus did an apprenticeship as a typographer. At the same time he studied visual communication and art history at the Hochschule D√ºsseldorf. In 1976, he co- founded the first artist's gallery and picture lending library in M√ºlheim an der Ruhr, called \\"Atelier i.d. Altstadt\\". In December 1977 the first artistic works with copiers were produced and displayed. In the following years, two other artist's galleries evolved from this first project: the \\"Panoptikum\\" (1978‚Äì1980) and the \\"Holoskop\\" (1980‚Äì1984). Since 1980, Urbons has been self- employed as an author, graphic-designer, curator, artist and has been researching on the history, technology and art of photocopying, electrography and digital media. He is one of the major experts in this field worldwide. In 1984 the international exhibition project, curated by Urbons, \\"Art Shelter ‚Äî Kunstschutzkeller\\", took place. It has been a 1 year long project that involved a large group of international artists. In March 1985 Klas Urbons founded the \\"Museum f√ºr Fotokopie\\" in M√ºlheim an der Ruhr, an international forum for technology and Art produced with photocopiers. The Museum built up one of the most important collection of Art in this field, covering the technological and artistic history of modern photocopying Art. More than 20 exhibitions of Copy Art produced by artists from Germany and abroad have been organized by the Museum as well as competitions and workshops. The Museum also collected several devices from the very early stages of this printing technique in the 1950s: in Germany called Blitzkopie and in the USA called xerography. The collection of about 100 copying machines and consumables, technical library & documentation as well as a prospectus collection (since 1950) is hosted by the German Museum of Technology (Berlin) in 1999. In 2013, Urbons co-founded the \\"Makroscope: Centre for Art and Technology\\" in M√ºlheim. In 2017, Klaus Urbons was awarded the Prize .

Location Ardfert Abbey is located in the east part of Ardfert village. History It is thought that Ardfert was the original site of the monastery founded by Saint Brendan, which burned down c. 1089. Ardfert Friary was founded for the Order of Friars Minor Conventual c. 1253 by Thomas Fitzmaurice, 1st Baron Kerry; he was purportedly buried here c. 1280‚Äì1. In 1310 a disagreement with the Bishop of Ardfert and Aghadoe Nicol √ì Samrad√°in led to some friars suffering violent beatings. A residential tower was added to the west end of the church in the 15th century. It was refounded in 1517 for the Observant Franciscan Friars and finally dissolved in 1584; Col. John Zouche turned it into a barracks. Some friars remained in the area. In 1590 it belonged to James FitzGerald, 1st Earl of Desmond. In 1636 the friary was absorbed into the estate of the Earls of Glandore (Crosbie family). In 1670 the 15th-century window of the church was moved to Ardfert Cathedral; it was returned to the friary in 1815. Buildings The layout of the building follows the standard layout of most Franciscan friaries: a large church, cloister and residential offices. The church is a long nave and chancel. A residential tower was added to the west end in the 15th century. It contains five floors, some with window seats and garderobes. There is a thirteenth-century window divided into five lights at the east gable which would have lit up the choir. There are also nine lancet windows in the south wall; the design appears to be copied from Ardfert Cathedral.

Dourson is an American toxicologist and Director of Science at the nonprofit organization, Toxicology Excellence for Risk Assessment. He was formerly a senior advisor to the Administrator of EPA, and prior to that, a professor at the Risk Science Center at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. Prior to joining the University of Cincinnati, he was founder and president of the nonprofit Toxicology Excellence for Risk Assessment. Earlier in his career, he was employed by the Environmental Protection Agency Environmental Criteria and Assessment Office, among other assignments. In July 2017, Dourson was nominated by President Donald Trump to become Assistant Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention. The United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works voted to advance his nomination on October 25, 2017. Dourson withdrew his nomination on December 13, 2017. Career Dourson is board-certified by the American Board of Toxicology and a fellow of the Academy of Toxicological Sciences and the Society for Risk Analysis. He joined the Environmental Protection Agency after earning his doctorate in toxicology at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. During his time at the EPA, Dourson was one of the founders of the agency‚Äôs Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS), a program that identifies and characterizes the health hazards of chemicals in the environment. Dourson was awarded a total of four bronze medals for his work on IRIS, ambient water criteria, sewage sludge rulemaking, and developing risk methodology during his 15-year tenure with the agency. He also served as a member of EPA‚Äôs Science Advisory Board for six years. Dourson worked in various roles in Cincinnati, Chicago, and Washington D.C. before founding the nonprofit Toxicology Excellence for Risk Assessment (TERA) in 1995. TERA determines the risk profile of chemicals, and maintained the International Toxicity Estimates for Risk (ITER) database until TERA was invited by the University of Cincinnati in 2015 to join as a separate center within the Department of Environmental Health. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toxicology Data Network (TOXNET) includes ITER in its list of reference databases for public use. The nonprofit has accepted payments for criticizing studies that raised concerns about the safety of its clients' products. Although TERA has collaborated with industry sponsors, the organization‚Äôs annual reports indicate that TERA collaborates with government sponsors twice as often---over 70 government organizations during its history. Dourson was awarded the Arnold J. Lehman award from the Society of Toxicology and the International Achievement Award by the International Society of Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology. He is a fellow of the Academy of Toxicological Sciences and the Society for Risk Analysis. Dourson is also a writer of a series of books entitled Evidence of Faith which examine the intersection of evolution and Bible history. Toxicology debates Dourson's organization TERA has studied many substances whose use has been the matter of public debate, including chlorpyrifos (a pesticide), diacetyl (a food additive), ammonium perchlorate (a rocket fuel), 1-bromopropane (an industrial solvent), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (a plastics production chemical). The determinations of safe occupational exposure limits, safe water standards, threshold limit value, recommended exposure limit and safe dose may vary by a factor of ten, even among equally qualified investigators. In his 2017 confirmation hearings, Dourson was grilled about safe levels of PFOA in drinking water. The attack came amid the filing of 3,500 lawsuits over PFOA exposure. In 2002, Dourson and two other TERA scientists had participated in a court-ordered ten-person panel to review existing research on PFOA. Five members of the panel were government representatives and two from DuPont. The panel found no history of illness or premature death in 3M or DuPont manufacturing workers since 1947. It did find a heightened liver disease risk in animal models among other lesser risks. The panel recommended a reduction in the allowable amount in drinking water to 150 ppb, a reduction from a DuPont-sponsored recommendation of 210 ppb. The concentration of PFOA in the Lubeck, West Virginia public water supply was at that time 1 ppb. In 2018, Dourson filed comments urging a \\"less stringent level\\" for PFOA and PFOS in response to a federal study. Failed nomination to EPA In July 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Dourson to become Assistant Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention. His nomination was sent to the United States Senate on July 19, 2017. His hearing before the United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works took place on October 4, 2017. During the hearing, he was criticized by Democrats for his ties to the chemical industry. Dourson defended himself to the satisfaction of the committee, saying he would commit to the law and the EPA's mission to protect the public and the environment from chemicals. Dourson's nomination was endorsed by the American Chemistry Council. An October 2017 New York Times editorial called Dourson a \\"scientist for hire\\" and said his nomination for an EPA post was \\"dangerous to public health.\\" During his Senate confirmation process, he respond privately in writing to accusations and these responses were sent to several US Senators. These responses have been made public. Risk Policy Report. \\"Dourson, Stalled EPA Toxics Nominee, Asks Trump To Withdraw Nomination.\\" December 17, 2017. For a copy, see: https://www.tera.org/about/TERAcollaborativework%2012.8.17.pdf. Dourson withdrew his nomination on December 13, 2017.

In this election, Roosevelt's chosen successor, Republican William Howard Taft, ran in large part on Roosevelt's Progressive legacy and decisively defeated former Congressman and three-time Democratic U.S. Presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan (who also advocated progressive ideas in his campaign). Overall, the 1908 presidential campaign and election were about labor issues, trusts, campaign finance reform, imperialism, and corruption. Fight for the nomination 1896, 1900, and 1908 Democratic presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan A political cartoon which portrays William Howard Taft as President Roosevelt's political heir During his 1908 campaign, Bryan criticized U.S. House Speaker Joseph Gurney Cannon. A map of the 1908 U.S. Presidential election by county Bryan's ties with Charles Haskell ended up hurting him late in the campaign. Democrat Alton Parker's defeat at the hands of President Theodore Roosevelt (who succeeded William McKinley after his assassination) in 1904 gave William Jennings Bryan, the 1896 and 1900 Democratic presidential nominee, an opening to reassert his leadership in the Democratic Party. Bryan also was helped by newspaper tycoon and 1904 contender William Randolph Hearst's loss in the 1905 New York mayoral election, which hurt Hearst's chances to get the 1908 Democratic presidential nomination. Bryan therefore was the front-runner. Bryan's most formidable challenger was Minnesota Governor John Albert Johnson. Johnson's rags-to-riches story, honesty, reformist credentials, and ability to win in a heavily Republican U.S. state made him popular within the Democratic Party. Johnson ultimately was unable to overcome Bryan, and by the end of June 1908 Bryan had the two- thirds of the delegates needed to win the nomination. At the 1908 Democratic National Convention, Johnson (who had no chance at the nomination by then) released his delegates to Bryan, helping Bryan to win the nomination on the first ballot with 892.5 votes to 105.5 votes for other (favorite son) candidates. For Bryan's vice presidential running mate the convention delegates selected John W. Kern, a former state senator (1893-1897) and two- time gubernatorial candidate (and later U.S. Senator) from Indiana. In response to Bryan's and Kern's nomination, The New York Times disparagingly pointed out that the Democratic national ticket was consistent because \\"a man twice defeated for the Presidency was at the head of it, and a man twice defeated for governor of his state [in 1900 and 1904] was at the tail of it.\\" During the campaign, the fact that this was Bryan's third Democratic presidential nomination was mocked by Republicans. Specifically, Republicans told voters to \\"[v]ote for Taft now[]\\" because they could \\"vote for Bryan anytime.\\" Campaign The 1908 Democratic platform criticized corporate power at the expense of the people as well as the increased number of federal officeholders and expenditures‚Äî\\"the heedless waste of the people's money\\"‚Äîand demanded \\"the strictest economy in every department compatible with frugal and efficient administration.\\" In addition, the Democrats condemned the \\"arbitrary power\\" of the Republican U.S. House Speaker Joseph Gurney Cannon (of Illinois) as well as the use of patronage by President Roosevelt to nominate \\"one of his Cabinet officers\\" (Taft) as his successor. Due to Bryan's efforts, a plank in the platform called for federal legislation requiring the publication of campaign contributions, limiting the amount that individuals could donate, and banning contributions from business corporations (via their officers), the last punishable by imprisonment. The platform reiterated the party's longstanding support of tariff reform and welcomed Republicans' \\"tardy recognition of the righteousness of the Democratic position\\". Labeling private monopoly \\"indefensible and intolerable,\\" the trusts plank advocated three laws: banning directors from sitting on the board of more than one competing business, federal licensing of any corporation before it could control 25% of a market and prohibiting control of over 50% market-share of an American- consumed product, and requiring corporations to sell to all purchasers on the same terms (except for transportation costs). At Bryan's urging, his previous endorsement of government ownership of railroads was omitted from the platform. The Democratic platform nevertheless advocated regulatory authority for the Interstate Commerce Commission, emergency currency \\"issued and controlled by the Federal Government,\\" and an income tax on individuals and corporations. Accepting most of the demands of Samuel Gompers, the President of the American Federation of Labor, the Democrats criticized the unfair use of injunctions against striking workers, affirmed the right of labor to organize and not be charged with restraining trade, and favored an eight-hour workday for federal employees, a general employers' liability law, and a separate Department of Labor. Also, the Democrats advocated in support of a homestead law for Hawaii, territorial governments for Alaska and Puerto Rico, independence for the Philippines once a stable government was established, and a ban on Asian immigration to the United States. Unlike in 1896 and 1900, Bryan did not advocate in favor of free silver in 1908, believing this issue to be dead. Rather, Bryan focused on labor issues, trusts, campaign finance reform, and imperialism during his campaign. As in 1896 and 1900, Bryan ran an active and energetic campaign and delivered speeches throughout the North and West. Of the 60 days that Bryan spent on the campaign trail, half were spent in the Midwest, 10 in New York, 6 in other Eastern states, and the remaining 14 days in the Plains States and Colorado. Meanwhile, vice-presidential nominee Kern focused on campaigning in the South. As in 1896 and 1900, Bryan attracted large crowds and gave numerous speeches each day (including a record-breaking 30). Due to his older age, Bryan became more exhausted as a result of giving so many speeches than he was back in 1896 and 1900. While he expected to lose New England and the West Coast, Bryan expected to hold the South and Rocky Mountain States (as he did in both 1896 and 1900). Late in the campaign, Bryan was hurt by his ties with Democratic National Committee treasurer and Oklahoma Governor Charles Haskell. William Randolph Hearst revealed that both Haskell and Ohio Republican U.S. Senator Joseph Foraker accepting bribes in an attempt to stop the antitrust suit against the Standard Oil Company. While Taft quickly cut off all of his ties with Senator Foraker, Bryan refused to do the same with Governor Haskell due to his refusal to believe the charges against Haskell. In response, outgoing U.S. President Roosevelt called Bryan's association with and support of Haskell a \\"scandal and disgrace.\\" Results Taft defeated Bryan by a two-to-one (321 to 162) margin in the Electoral College and by a 52% to 43.5% margin in the popular vote. Bryan did worse in 1908 than he did in both 1896 and 1900, carrying only the South, Oklahoma, Colorado, and Nevada (Bryan also won 6 of 8 electors in Maryland while losing the state to Taft by less than 0.30%). Bryan won no crucial states and only won two large cities, Kansas City and New Orleans. Taft did well in the more urban Northeast, the Midwest, and the Pacific Coast. While Bryan lost the election, Democrats picked up eight seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, gained strength in most state legislatures, and won governorships in five states that Taft carried that year. In addition to this, and despite Bryan's loss, many of his proposed reforms from 1908 eventually become law, such as the direct election of senators (1913), a federal income tax (1913), and the government guarantee of bank deposits (1933).

Published by Cambridge University Press, it includes an introduction from Hopkins and an essay from Wollheim, as well as selections from philosophers such as Ludwig Wittgenstein, Clark Glymour, Adam Morton, Stuart Hampshire, Brian O'Shaughnessy, Jean-Paul Sartre, Thomas Nagel, and Donald Davidson. The essays deal with philosophical questions raised by the work of Freud, including topics such as materialism, intentionality, and theories of the self's structure. They represent a range of different viewpoints, most of them from within the tradition of analytic philosophy. The book received a mixture of positive, mixed, and negative reviews. Commentators found the contributions included in the book to be of uneven value. Summary Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis. Philosophical Essays on Freud includes an introduction from James Hopkins and selections from the philosophers Ludwig Wittgenstein, Clark Glymour, Adam Morton, Stuart Hampshire, David Sachs, Brian O'Shaughnessy, Richard Wollheim, Ronald de Sousa, Patrick Suppes, Jean-Paul Sartre, Herbert Fingarette, Thomas Nagel, Irving Thalberg, David Pears, and Donald Davidson, as well from B. R. Cosin and W. D. Hart. Some of the selections are reprints from Freud: A Collection of Critical Essays (1974), a work edited by Wollheim. The selection from Wittgenstein is reprinted from Wittgenstein: Lectures and Conversations (1966), edited by Cyril Barrett. The selections concern \\"philosophical issues arising from the work of Freud\\", such as the question of how Freud's explanations relate to those in physical and experimental science. They represent a range of different viewpoints, the majority being within the tradition of analytic philosophy. Wittgenstein's contribution, \\"Conversations on Freud; excerpt from 1932-33 lectures\\", reports on conversations between Wittgenstein and the philosopher Rush Rhees. Discussing the nature of science, Wittgenstein contrasts psychology with physics, observing that the former may appear inadequate by comparison with the latter. He also explores Freud's theory of dreams. Glymour's essay, \\"Freud, Kepler, and the clinical evidence\\", discusses issues involved in experimentally testing psychoanalytic theory. Glymour observes that psychoanalysts have opposed evaluating psychoanalysis solely on the basis of statistical hypothesis testing on grounds such as that the hypotheses tested by experimental psychologists are \\"often no more than surrogates for the genuine article, and inferences from the falsity of such ersatz hypotheses to the falsity of psychoanalysis are not legitimate.\\" Cosin's essay, \\"Critical empiricism criticized: the case of Freud\\", written with C. F. Freeman and N. H. Freeman, discusses Freudian theory in relation to the philosophy of science. Cosin, Freeman, and Freeman criticize the philosopher Frank Cioffi, arguing that Cioffi describes Freudian theory as a form of pseudoscience by employing an inappropriate model of science. They note that Cioffi builds on the work of the philosopher Karl Popper. Morton's essay, \\"Freudian commonsense\\", addresses Freud's influence on popular thinking about the mind and human motivation. Morton maintains that Freud's theories have influenced conceptions of mind and motive in a way that no psychological theory ever previously has. Hampshire's essay, \\"Disposition and memory\\", is a revised version of a paper first published in The International Journal of Psychoanalysis in 1962. It provides an account of mental dispositions and character traits, in which Hampshire attempts to explain their development, as well as how impulses come to be inhibited. Hampshire describes the essay as having Freud's theory of repression as its starting point, noting that the theory seems to suggest different views of repression and its relation to anxiety. Sach's essay, \\"On Freud's doctrine of emotions\\", argues that summaries of Freud's thought have tended to neglect Freud's doctrine of the emotions. Sachs focuses in particular on Freud's view that a person's emotions are always proportionate in nature to their causes and objects, even though their relationship to them may appear to be discrepant or incongruous. O'Shaughnessy's essay, \\"The id and the thinking process\\", evaluates the plausibility of Freud's concept of the id. O'Shaughnessy provides an account of relevant psychological processes such as the human will and the relationship between the ego and the id. He argues that willing always proceeds from the ego and never from the id. He also explores related subjects such as dreams. Wollheim's essay, \\"The bodily ego\\", argues that a concept of \\"the bodily ego\\" played a role in Freud's later thinking. Wollheim argues that the concept was concerned with the way in which mental states are related to the body and that its central claim is that certain mental states understand themselves as being, at least in part, bodily states. De Sousa's essay, \\"Norms and the normal\\", discuses the moral implications of Freud's understanding of human nature. He maintains that Freud was mistaken to deny that psychoanalysis has moral implications, arguing that any comprehensive view of human nature must have implications for the relationship between the capacities of human beings and their normal or ideal state should be understood. He also makes the case that Freud's views contrast with classical theories of human nature. Suppes's essay, \\"On the generation and classification of defence mechanisms\\", written with Hermine Warren, discusses defence mechanisms, attempting to develop a theory to account for them. Suppes and Warren propose a framework within which the defence mechanisms can be systematically defined, generated, and classified. Hart's essay, \\"Models of repression\\", discusses what it means for a mental phenomenon to be unconscious and the processes by which mental phenomena are rendered unconscious. He explores models of unconscious states and repression, arguing that it is important to treat the unconscious and repression simultaneously. The selection from Sartre, \\"Mauvaise foi and the unconscious\\", is an extract from Being and Nothingness (1943) in which Sartre criticizes Freud's theory of the unconscious, and discusses Freud's ideas in relation to Sartre's conception of bad faith. Sartre maintains that by distinguishing between the id and the ego, Freud undermines the unity of the mind. Fingarette's essay, \\"Self-deception and the 'splitting of the ego'\\", proposes a model of self-deception that does not view it as based on holding inconsistent beliefs or as primarily a matter of belief. Fingarette maintains that this model avoids the paradox inherent in seeing self-deception as involving making oneself believe something that one still does not believe. He compares his understanding of self-deception to Freud's ideas. Nagel's essay, \\"Freud's anthropomorphism\\", discusses Freud's views about the physical basis of mental phenomena such as perception, as well as experiences and desires. He explores the question of whether it is possible to understand the physical systems that underlie human psychology using the same language ordinarily used to describe human mental states without understanding the physical significance of those descriptions. Thalberg's essay, \\"Freud's anatomies of the self\\", discusses Freud's explanations of both normal and disturbed forms of behavior in terms of a conflict of forces within a person. Thalberg describes Freud's explanations as ingenious and suggestive, but questions their coherence. In his view, while it was reasonable for Freud to propose such explanations, they nevertheless resulted in conceptual confusion. Pears's essay, \\"Motivated irrationality, Freudian theory and cognitive dissonance\\", discusses Freud's explanations of errors such as forgetting and misreading, contrasting Freud's views of such \\"motivated irrationality\\" with theories put forward by philosophers. Pears criticizes Sartre's discussion of Freud, describing his critique of Freud's theories as complex but \\"not very precisely formulated\\" and open to several different interpretations, as well as various potential objections. Davidson's essay, \\"Paradoxes of irrationality\\", based on a 1978 lecture, discusses what it means for an action, belief, intention, inference or emotion to be irrational. Davidson argues that irrationality represents a failure of rationality rather than the absence of a capacity for rationality, and that a satisfactory account of irrationality must draw on Freud's ideas.

The book received mixed reviews from Kathleen Wilkes in The Times Literary Supplement and the philosopher Frank Cioffi in the London Review of Books, and negative reviews from Psychological Medicine as well from the philosopher Eugen Baer in Semiotica. Goldsmith praised Hopkins's introduction. She also praised the selections chosen by Wollheim and Hopkins, which she considered well-presented discussions of topics such as Freud's materialism, intentionality, and theories of the self's structure. She concluded that the collection would be useful to researchers. Symington believed that the papers included were variable in quality and would not appeal to those with a positivist outlook, but nevertheless found the book as a whole a worthwhile work. He criticized the contribution by Hopkins, but praised the contributions by Hampshire, Sachs, O'Shaughnessy, and Wollheim. Wilkes wrote that there was \\"something in this collection for everybody\\", but suggested that only \\"a few will find a great deal\\" because of the \\"slimness of the unifying thread\\". Cioffi questioned the judgment of some of the contributors. He wrote that while many of the papers included were distinguished, those that dealt with the question of why psychoanalysis is still the subject of \\"radical scepticism\\" were flawed. He described Hopkins's introduction as a \\"shabby\\" psychoanalytic apologetic. He accused Hopkins of dismissing criticism of psychoanalysis by arguing that psychological factors such as attitudes to bodily processes make it difficult for people to assess psychoanalysis fairly, and of discussing psychoanalysis without being clear what his credentials were for doing so. He also criticized the contributions by Glymour, Morton, Sartre, and Hampshire. Psychological Medicine wrote that while a few contributors to the book took \\"an overtly critical stand\\", the majority \\"indulge in tortuous ratiocination which does little more than transport the familiar arguments into their own conceptual spheres\\", concluding that in so doing they \\"tend to support Freud's own mistrust of philosophical inquiry.\\" Baer maintained that while some contributors to the book tried to defend Freud, their contributions amounted to defenses of their own philosophical positions. He argued that they used discussing Freud as an opportunity to promote their personal opinions. He criticized the omission of any contribution from the philosopher Paul Ric≈ìur's Freud and Philosophy (1965). He also suggested that many of the contributions expressed familiar views, and that those from Anglo-Saxon authors could be contrasted with views held by French authors such as the philosopher Jacques Derrida and the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. He criticized the contributions by Nagel, Thalberg, O'Shaughnessy, and Davidson, and maintained that while Hampshire's contribution showed \\"philosophic acuity\\", it was also for the most part \\"not at all concerned with Freud's text.\\" Philosophical Essays on Freud has been praised by some philosophers, including Michael Ruse, and criticized by others, such as Ernest Gellner. Some discussion of the work has focused on the contributions by individual authors. The philosopher Adolf Gr√ºnbaum criticized Glymour's views about the problems involved in establishing the accuracy of psychoanalytic theory. The philosopher Jonathan Lear praised Hopkins's discussion of holism and its relation to psychoanalysis. Glymour criticized Thalberg's interpretation of Freud's explanations of irrational behavior. Gellner criticized Wollheim and Hopkins for accepting the claim that psychoanalysis had \\"privileged access to truth\\". However, he saw merit in Davidson's contribution to Philosophical Essays on Freud. Nagel praised Davidson and Hopkins for thoroughly developing the view that \\"psychoanalysis can borrow empirical evidence for its most important general foundations from the ubiquitous confirmation of the system of ordinary psychological explanation in everyday life\\". In the British Psychoanalytic Society Book Club Leaflet, David Bell described Philosophical Essays on Freud as a \\"seminal\\" work.

Originally presenting the complete will, while the surviving pieces of the inscription include parts of all 133 lines, much of the beginning and ends of all of the lines are missing. Nevertheless, it is of great value for prosopographic reasons, as well as an example of a Roman legal document for which otherwise there are few examples.  Description  Pieces of this inscription were first found in 1820, containing lines 1-56 and more were identified in 1830, containing lines 57-133. Theodor Mommsen reconstructed this document for publication in the series Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum, which was considered as faithful as possible until the recovery of a further piece by Antonio Ferrua in the 1970s, which added to the first 19 lines of the inscription.Ferrua published this fragment as \\"Ultime Scoperte a S. Callisto\\", Rivista di Archeologia Christiana, 52 (1976), pp. 21ff This new fragment proved Mommsen's restorations of those lines as inaccurate, and brought into question his restoration of the rest of the inscription. Since then, Werner Eck has offered a new restoration of those lines based on Ferrua's discovery, which while commonly accepted is still considered tentative.Eck, \\"Zum neuen Fragment des sogenannten Testamentum Dasumii\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 30 (1978), pp. 277-95 The inscription is dated to the consulate of Publius Aelius Hadrianus and Marcus Trebatius Priscus, or the summer of 108.  The testator  The will mentions a number of people -- the Epigraphische Datenbank Heidelberg counts 87 different people\\"Epigraphische Text-Datenbank: Detailansicht\\"  most prominent are the emperor Trajan, the consuls Lucius Julius Ursus Servianus, and Quintus Sosius Senecio. However, scholarly interest has primarily focused on the identity of the testator of the will. Bartolomeo Borghesi, noting a Da[sumia] amongst the heirs, and observing mention of a nurse Dasumia Syche, whom Borghesi concluded was a freedman of the testator, identified him as a member of the gens Dasumius -- hence the name of the stone. Mommsen embraced this identification, and at one point the testator was identified with Lucius Dasumius Hadrianus, suffect consul about 93, but various details prevented complete acceptance.Ronald Syme, \\"The Testamentum Dasumii: Some Novelties\\", Chiron, 15 (1985), pp. 41-44 It took Werner Eck's work to refute the identification decisively and show the testator did not belong to that gens. Following Eck's article, Ronald Syme proposed Gnaeus Domitius Tullus as the testator.Syme, \\"The Testamentum Dasumii: Some Novelties\\", pp. 41-63 More recently, Joshua Tate has raised the possibility that the testator may not even be a senator, but points out that many problems in the document are resolved if he had been a wealthy freedman. \\"Until further research provides a more definite answer,\\" Tate concludes, \\"we must remain open to the possibility that the testator was not only an Ignotus, but an Ignotus libertus\\".Tate, \\"New Thoughts on the 'Will of Dasumius'\\", Zeitschrift der Savigny-Stiftung f√ºr Rechtsgeschichte Romanistische Abtheilung, 122 (2005), p. 171  Other examples of Roman Wills  There are few other examples of Roman wills. Literary sources present a few fictional examples, the will of Trimalchio in Petronius' Satyricon being the best known one. A less well known fictive example is the humorous Testamentum Porcelli, the last testament of a pig named M. Grunnius Corocotta, who dictates his testament in his last hours before being slaughtered by a butcher.Discussed by Edward Champlin, \\"The Testament of the Piglet\\", Phoenix, 41 (1987), pp. 174-183 Pliny the Younger recounts the opening of the will of his friend Domitius Tullus, without providing any information on the legal language of the document.Pliny, Epistulae, VIII.18 A handful of actual wills have been identified amongst the papyrus, written by soldiers in Egypt such as Antonius Silvanus,Published as Fontes iuris Romani antiustiniani, second edition (1940-43), III.47 but these are military wills and observe practices different than the so-called Testamentum Dasumii, which is an example of a will amentum per aes ci libram.

Jack was always going for a walk in the town and he just left Rocky‚Äôs pub after drinking a cup of tea. Cawley entered the house and chatted to Jack for around 20 minutes and then searched for drugs, then he proceeded to assault Jack in his kitchen with a shovel and then boiled Jack's kettle and poured the boiling hot water over his scrotum. As he was leaving the house, he heard Tommy in his bedroom and he thought since they were living together maybe they were pedophiles. Cawley beat Tommy with a stick over 25 times and left the house after spending over an hour in it and went back to his B&B.; At 7:15 am their helper arrived at their home and discovered their dead bodies.http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/he-was-determined-to-kill- someone-cousin-of-elderly-blaine-brothers-condemns-murderer-35970532.html Personal life Victims Both Jack and Tommy Blaine were very religious and devout Catholics.

Buttermilk Falls Buttermilk Falls has an elevations change of 1104 feet and is moderately difficult to get to but the trail length is not very long only 1.4 miles each way. Buttermilk Falls is one of the tallest waterfalls in New Jersey. The waterfall is near the north end of the Delaware Water Gap in New Jersey. Dingmans Falls Dingmans Falls Base View Dingmans Birds Eye View Dingmans Falls is the second highest waterfall in the state of Pennsylvania with a plunge of 130 feet. It is located at the northern end of the park. There is a beautiful boardwalk that leads you to the base of the Waterfall where you can see the 80 foot cascading drop. This boardwalk is roughly a half a mile long and only takes you to the base of the fall. the broad walk include the sites of Dingmans Falls and Silverthread Falls. You can continue on up a series of stairs to the waterfall and see the entire 130 foot plunge from the birds eye view.

The base of this waterfall is not accessible unless the fence is jumped, this is not prohibited.  Deer Leap Falls Deer Leap Falls Entered The third last fall of the trail of George W. Childs Park is Deer Leap Falls. There is a bridge over top of the falls that gives it a very majestic look. The fall itself can be seen from all sides well including above because the bridge allows site-seers to walk on top of the fall.

Ernest is the small boy atop the rear of the carriage Ernest Gustav Brandon-Cremer (15 February 1895 ‚Äì 1 March 1957) was a New Zealand/Australian moviemaker, newsman, explorer and adventurer. He was a key figure in Australian aviation history, and was especially known for his documentation of Lasseter's Gold Reef as well as his photography of the Solar eclipse of 21 September 1922 at Wallal, Australia.  Early life  In Dunedin, New Zealand, Brandon-Cremer was born to Albert Wilhelm Anton Brandon-Cremer and Annie Beaton in a theatrical family, his parents traversing New Zealand and Australia by horse and carriage over several decades in the early days of vaudeville in Australasia. His childhood was marked by a never present father and an alcoholic mother, a marriage soon to be dissolved with the children abandoned to the State. Brandon-Cremer ran away from home at 11 and had to fend for himself. Brandon-Cremer claims that he was taken in by a travelling American minister and he ended up spending the next 6 years in Hollywood. In 1913, he was tried in Adelaide for breaking and entering, including theft, and sentenced to 18 months in prison. A later court visit for vagrancy in June 1915 showed he was now in Melbourne. In both instances he listed his profession as cinematographer, a craft he repeatedly contended to have picked up on his travels to Hollywood; in one statement, he indicated that he worked for the Vitagraph Company of America, beginning in 1910. Newspaper notices and advertisements show that Brandon-Cremer worked as a cinematographer with A. C. Tinsdale starting in 1915, a relationship that would last many years, and would benefit him greatly. In May 1917 Brandon-Cremer became second wireless operator aboard the Steamship 'Boonah' as he headed for the UK. In August 1917 he joined the British Garrison Artillery (BGA), part of the UK Royal Horse Artillery as a gunner (serial no. 198613). It seems he never saw active service over his 18 months with the BGA, but did qualify for several medals. In press interviews later in life, Brandon-Cremer said he was \\"associated\\" with the R.A.F. and consequently saw service with the British North Russian Relief Force in Russia during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War, and took part in the evacuation of Archangel in northern Russia) in late 1919 He has stated he earned the Distinguished Flying Cross, (not verified) (evidence of his flying ability can be found in the short travelogue \\"In and Around MacKay\\" (1933), where he is seen in the cockpit flying above MacKay) Upon his BGA discharge in February 1919, Brandon-Cremer started a 15-month stint with the London YMCA as a cinematographer. Two months later, on 19 April, he married Minnie Henrietta Warren. Minnie, age 22, from London. He listed his occupation as Film Operator. It seems Minnie died the following year. In June 1920 Brandon-Cremer went to work in South Africa for a year making short films for the South African Film Trust. On 11 July 1921 he returned to the UK aboard the RMS 'Kinfauns' from South Africa.  The Spanish Foreign Legion, 1921  In August 1921, Brandon-Cremer travelled to Spain to join the Spanish Legion fighting the Moors (Rif) in North Africa, and participated in 11 battles. He was repatriated to the UK in November, giving interviews to the British press, representing himself as the only Australian (New Zealander) to join the Spanish Legion. He later claimed to have been under the command of then Capt. Francisco Franco (subsequent dictator of Spain). His accounts of the ill treatment of British recruits to the Spanish Legion were widely reported in American, British and Australian newspapers. Upon reading such reports, his former business partner, A. C. Tinsdale started a campaign to return Brandon-Cremer to Australia. It seems that this was accomplished as Brandon-Cremer returned to Albany, Western Australia aboard the MS Euripides on 9 March 1922.  The Eclipse at Wallal, Western Australia, 1922  Wallal, Western Australia was the chosen location for a visiting US Lick Observatory party of Astronomers, led by W. W. Campbell, to view the upcoming Solar eclipse of 21 September 1922. The purpose of the expedition to view stellar transits of the Sun's disk during the eclipse to measure and verify Albert Einstein's Theory of relativity. Wallal was preferred for its isolation from man-made light sources, its propensity for clear skies and its location to gain the longest eclipse duration. Brandon-Cremer, along with his business partner C. A. Sharpe were hired to document the expedition in both still photography and moving picture film. Hundreds of images from the team are kept at the archives of the University of California, Santa Cruz (donated by the Lick Observatory), and a second source of photos are kept at the Western Australia archives in Perth. A film made by Brandon-Cremer entitled Astronomers and Aborigines was distributed globally to showcase the Eclipse of 1922. A very young Sir Charles Kingsford-Smith was the pilot of the Western Australian Airways Bristol Type 28 Coupe Tourers plane (G-AUDF) that made bi- weekly mail drops to the Astronomers during the expedition. Kingsford-Smith took Brandon-Cremer aloft to shoot aerial footage of the camp, which was later used in the film previously mentioned.

A film about automobiles, motorcycles, trucks, tractors and aircraft built in Britain and transported for sale in Australia. On 15 July 1925, Brandon-Cremer married a second time to Sara Inez Vera Bell in Queensland. Sara lost a newborn son, Anthony Brandon-Cremer on 14 March 1926, also in Queensland. The marriage dissolved shortly after. Brandon-Cremer was active in covering aviation news and filming scenes in flight. He was instrumental in covering the arrival of the Southern Cross on its journey on the first Trans-Pacific flight to Australia in 1928, piloted by his friend Charles Kingsford-Smith. Later that year while covering the arrival of the 'British Super-marines' of the Royal Air Force from London to Sydney, he and his pilot Sturt Griffith ditched into Sydney Harbour. Both men suffered minor injuries. Six months later Brandon-Cremer was the observer for Gypsy-Moth deliveries between Melbourne and Sydney. Another newspaper article mentions his participation on filming the departure of the aeroplane 'Canberra' (de Havilland Giant Moth), an aerial expedition sent out to find the missing 'Southern Cross', piloted by Kingsford-Smith, on its attempted trip from Sydney to London. Finally, Brandon-Cremer was included in a ride along on the Vellore aeroplane journey from London to Sydney. Ernest Brandon-Cremer with the Cinesound crew Bondi Junction 1930  Cinesound newsreels, 1930s  Brandon-Cremer worked for the newsreel producers Cinesound during the 1930s. Cinesound was a competitor to Movietone News. The Cinesound studio was based in Bondi Junction, Sydney. The Cinesound cadre of cinematographers included Bill Carty, Joe Stafford, Arthur Smith, Bert Cross, Frank Bagnell, Clive Cross, Frank Coffey, George Heath, Frank Hurley, Stan Murdoch, Bill Shepherd and George Malcolm.  Lasseter's Reef of Gold, 1931  The gold prospector Lewis Harold Bell Lasseter had become famous by telling the story of his outback survival and discovery of a massive reef of surface gold near Uluru, Northern Territory. Members of the Sydney Stock Exchange organised the 'Central Australian Gold Exploration' Company (CAGE) to venture outback and rediscover this find. Camel trains and aircraft were sent out to scour the surrounds. One night during the expedition, Lasseter on camelback disappeared into the dark. After a futile search the party returned to Sydney. A second Expedition was organised called CAGE-II. In August 1931, while working for Cinesound, 'Bud' signed-on with the Central Australian Gold Exploration Company (CAGE-II) to produce all the photography and a documentary film for a search party expedition to attempt to find Lasseter and his fabled reef of gold. The party to be led by local Bob Buck, a close friend of Brandon-Cremer. The party left Alice Springs on Camel back en route to Uluru and the Western Ranges. A few hundred kilometres west of Uluru they discovered a tree with inscriptions and directions, left by Lasseter, to a river and cave. Upon digging a short while, Buck and Brandon- Cremer discovered the bones of Harold Lasseter, and his diary. A subsequent search did not find the fabled reef of gold. The story has become Australian folklore and some still believe the reef of gold exists.http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/review/luke-walker-digs-up-a-hot- prospect-with-lasseters-bones/story-fn9n8gph-1226741606541 Some of Brandon- Cremer's photos were later published in the chronicle of Lasseter's Last Ride by Ion L.

He was the son of Frank C. Jordan, California's Secretary of State from 1911-1940. When the younger Jordan defeated interim appointee Paul Peek in 1942, he became the first man in the history of California to be elected to succeed his father in a constitutional state office. His early death in office is notable for indirectly launching the career of Jerry Brown, and he suggested that blue and gold be made the official colors of the state of California. A veteran of the First World War, Jordan held an early job with the Automobile Association of California and ran his own general insurance agency before joining his father's staff. After delayed returns in the 1960 presidential election due to hand counting, Jordan championed legislation requiring mandatory use of voting machines. In 1964, he proposed statewide vote-by-mail, but this was not adopted. Jordan's efforts to mandate machine counting spurred development in computing systems in what became Silicon Valley. Jordan's early death in March 1970 created a vacancy to be filled by then-Governor Ronald Reagan, who believed it was unfair to appoint someone to the office and give that person a leg up in the November 1970 election. Therefore Reagan appointed a lower-level staff member, H.P. Sullivan, on an interim basis to fill the vacancy so that two Republicans could compete in the primary without the advantage of incumbency. The Republican primary was won by James L. Flournoy, an African-American Los Angeles attorney; this made Flournoy the first African-American nominated for statewide office in California by a major party. Flournoy lost the general election to Democrat Jerry Brown, who went on to serve as state attorney general and four terms as governor of California.

Upon graduation, Zheng chose to further his studies in education in Japan. Upon his return, Zheng worked as a mathematics teacher and department director at National Guangdong University. Time in Europe In late 1925, Zheng arrived in France to study at the University of Lyon. By 1926, Zheng became leader of the French chapter of the Kuomintang. From his base in Lyon, he oversaw party operations in several western European countries. In 1927, Zheng transferred to the University of Paris. The next year, he returned to China, attending the Third Kuomintang National Congress in Nanjing. Zheng then became the European bureau chief for the Central Daily News. Zheng formally declared his support of Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist government in 1930 and began work at the League of Nations. Zheng completed his degree in statistics from the University of Paris in 1931 and married Lun Yunshan two years later. Shortly thereafter, National Guangdong University Law School dean stepped down and Zou Lu offered the position to Zheng, who cited the events of the Fujian Rebellion as a reason he should continue working in government. As a result, Zheng returned to Geneva with his wife in 1934.  Return to China  Zheng left his position at the League of Nations in 1935 and became dean of SYSU Law School until 1937. After the Second Sino‚ÄìJapanese War broke out, Zheng sought to aid the war effort, moving from Guangzhou to Shanghai with the assistance of T. V. Soong. The war's opening engagement forced Zheng to Hong Kong. From Hong Kong, Zheng relocated to Wuhan, where he helped organize the in 1938, which he served as secretary-general. Zheng was elected to the Guangdong Provincial Government, serving between 1939 and 1943. During this time, Zheng served in several positions within the Kuomintang. He attended the Sixth Kuomintang National Congress, where he was named secretary- general of the party's central committee. In 1947, Zheng was elected to the Legislative Yuan for the first time.ÂäâÂ£ΩÊûóÁ≠âÁ∑®ÔºåÊ∞ëÂúãËÅ∑ÂÆòÂπ¥Ë°®ÔºåÂåó‰∫¨Ôºö‰∏≠ËèØÊõ∏Â±ÄÔºå1995Âπ¥ The next year, he succeeded Wu Tieh-cheng as secretary-general of the Kuomintang Central Committee.ÊùéÊñ∞Á∏Ω‰∏ªÁ∑®Ôºå‰∏≠ÂúãÁ§æÊúÉÁßëÂ≠∏Èô¢Ëøë‰ª£Âè≤Á†îÁ©∂ÊâÄ‰∏≠ËèØÊ∞ëÂúãÂè≤Á†îÁ©∂ÂÆ§Á∑®ÔºåÈüì‰ø°Â§´„ÄÅÂßúÂÖãÂ§´‰∏ªÁ∑®Ôºå„Ää‰∏≠ËèØÊ∞ëÂúãÂè≤Â§ß‰∫ãË®ò„ÄãÔºàÂÖ®ÂçÅ‰∫åÂç∑ÔºåÂÖ±ÂçÅ‰∫åÂÜäÔºâÔºåÂåó‰∫¨Ôºö‰∏≠ËèØÊõ∏Â±ÄÔºå2011Âπ¥7Êúà He won reelection to the legislature after the Constitution of the Republic of China went into effect. In April 1949, Zheng met with several senior members of the Kuomintang to discuss moving party leadership to Guangzhou.  Career in Taiwan  After the Second Chinese Civil War ended, Zheng moved to Taiwan. In January 1950, Zheng, and leading Kuomintang figures Huang Shao-ku, Chen Lifu, Chiang Ching-kuo, and Ku Cheng-kang, among others, met at Sun Moon Lake to discuss party reform. Zheng left the legislature in March 1952, and took office as the Minister of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission the next month. After leaving that post in 1958, Zheng returned to public service as Minister of Justice from 1960 to 1967. He was then named deputy secretary- general of the Presidential Office, before succeeding Zhang Qun as Secretary- General in 1972. Zheng was replaced by Chiang Yen-si as secretary-general, and became an adviser to Chiang Ching-kuo, who had become president. In 1979, Chang Chi-yun invited Zheng to join the faculty of Chinese Culture University. In later life, Zheng was diagnosed with colorectal cancer. His wife died on 12 March 1988 at Tri-Service General Hospital. Zheng died of a cerebral hemorrhage and renal failure at the same hospital on 21 June 1990, aged 88.

The Frick Collection, New York The Portrait of Comtesse d'Haussonville is an 1845 oil on canvas painting by the French Neoclassical artist Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. The sitter was Louise de Broglie, Countess d'Haussonville, of the wealthy House of Broglie. The Princesse de Broglie, whom Ingres later portrayed c. 1851‚Äì53, was married to Louise's brother Albert de Broglie, the French monarchist politician, diplomat and writer.\\"Jos√©phine-√âl√©onore-Marie- Pauline de Galard de Brassac de B√©arn (1825‚Äì1860), Princesses de Broglie\\". Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved 23 September 2017 Highly educated, Louise de Broglie was later an essayist and biographer, and published historical romance novels based on the lives of Lord Byron, Robert Emmett and Margaret of Valois.Rosenblum, 110 The painting is one of the few portrait commissions Ingres accepted at the time, as he was more interested Neoclassical subject matter, which to his frustration was a far less lucrative source of income than portraiture. He had made a preparatory sketch and had begun an oil and canvas version two years earlier, but abandoned the commission when de Broglie became pregnant and was no longer able to pose for the long periods he required, and she had anyway found interminable and \\"boring\\". The final work is signed and dated at the lower left. Commission By 1845 Ingres' fame was at its height, and he was much in demand as a portraitist. While lucrative, he found the format distracting from, and inferior to, his main interest of History painting. At the time, he committed to only two portraits; the current work and the Portrait of Baronne de Rothschild. Today, however, it is for portraits such as these that he is best known.Mongan and Naef, xxi Louise de Broglie (1818‚Äì1882) was 27 at the time of the portrait. Ingres had two to three years earlier sketched her with black chalk as a preparatory drawing, and begun an oil-on-canvas painting, which excludes the mirror and reflected images, and reverses the pose, but that was abandoned. The sessions were long and slow, and de Broglie found them wearisome, at one stage complaining \\"for the last nine days Ingres has been painting on one of the hands\\".Tinterow et al, 406 She fell pregnant with her third child, was thus unable to pose further, and the 1842 painting remains unfinished.Tinterow et al, 40 Ever contrary, Ingres later complained that he was unhappy with de Broglie's final portrait, and that he had failed to fully capture her charms. He was relieved when the portrait was met with approval from her family, writing that \\"family, friends, and above all the loving father [the duc de Broglie] were delighted with it. Finally to crown the work, M. Thiers ‚Äîand I was not present‚Äîcame to see it with the subject and repeated to her several times this wicked remark, 'M Ingres must be in love with you to have painted you that way.' But all this does not make me proud, and I do not feel that I have conveyed all the graces of that charming model.\\"Tinterow et al, 407-408 Description Detail The painting is composed from pale blue, grey, brown, gold and white hues. Mme. de Broglie is shown fully frontal, looking out at the viewer with a demure expression, the intensity of which has often been compared to his later portrait of Madame Moitessier.Betzer, 65 Ingres reintroduces a motif first seen in his 1814 Portrait of Madame de Senonnes, that of the central figure reflected in a background mirror. She wears a heavily folded cold grey-blue satin dress, painted with the same hue as her eyes. Her hair is parted and topped with a crimson ribbon at the back. The dresser before the mirror contains a variety of writing materials, pots and flowers, and a lavishly decorated oriental vase. The central motif of both the final painting and its predecessors is her raised left hand index finger, coyly placed by her mouth, and her sinuous, unnaturally elongated right arm. The painting was exhibited at the 1846 Bonne-Nouvelle exhibition alongside Ingres' 1814 Grande Odalisque and 1842 Odalisque with Slave, where all three works were praised by the French poet Charles Baudelaire for their \\"voluptuousness\\"; after the show he described Ingres as the quintessential painter of women, and described such portraits as the artist's highest accomplishments.Betzer, 90 Provenance The painting remained in the family's private possession for eighty years, though it was displayed publicly on occasion.

The first of which, on the smallest scale, being bacterial gene transfer (see bacterial transformations). Bacteria have the ability to exchange DNA. This DNA exchange, or horizontal gene transfer, may provide various species of bacteria with the genetic information they need to survive in an environment.\\"Horizontal Gene Transfer\\". (n.d.). This can help many bacterial species survive within an environment. A similar event has the ability to happen between plants and bacteria. For example, Agrobacterium tumefaciens has the ability to introduce genes into plants to cause the development of Gall disease. This occurs through genetic transfer between the A. tumefaciens and between the plant in question.\\"Methods of Gene Transfer in Plants\\" (2011) Agricultural Biosecurity In fact, a similar event occurs each time viral infections occur within living organisms. The viruses, whether positive or negative sense viruses, require a living organism to replicate their genes and produce more viruses. Once a virus is inside a living organism, it utilizes polymerases, ribosomes, and other biomolecules to replicate its own genetic material and to produce more virus genetic material similar to the original virus.7. Weaver, R. (2012). Molecular biology (5th ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill Thus, gene transfer may occur through many varying means. Thus, the study of this gene transfer throughout each ecosystem, whether it be through a bacterial ecosystem or through the ecosystem of an organism, genetic ecology is the study of this gene transfer and its causes.

Designed by Samuel Patch and Robert Glancey, it follows the local contemporary style of Romanesque and Classical Revival architecture. Expanded in the 1920s, the building eventually fell out of favor and was replaced with the current Waltham High School at a different location in 1969. It was used as the Central Junior High School in the 1970s and 1980s. The old Waltham High became defunct by the 1990s and sat empty for many years. The building was ultimately reoccupied; the additions constructed in the 1920s were removed, restoring the school to its 1902 appearance, and a modern addition was added directly behind the old building, which left the historical structure as the fa√ßade. The new construct, known now as John W. McDevitt Middle School (named for a former superintendent), entered service in 2003.

She founded and edited the journal la bella figura, which promoted the work of Italian-Americans. After a brief but successful run, she folded the journal when she decided to live in Italy. Before leaving the United States, she edited an anthology of poems that had appeared in the journal. She is the author of several novels and volumes of poetry, and her poems have appeared in numerous journals and anthologies.  Life  Romano was born in Brooklyn in 1951. She began writing novels at the age of eight and poetry at the age of 14. As the grandchild of immigrants from Naples and Sicily, she often writes on Italian-American themes, and on the intersection of Italian-American and sexual identities. She has been living in Italy since 2003. Her first two books, Vendetta (1992) and The Wop Factor (1994), have been widely used in women's literature and multicultural studies courses. As the editor of malafemmina press, she has published chapbooks by a number of Italian-American women poets. In 1988, as Italian-American literature experienced something of a \\"renaissance,\\" Romano reasoned that perhaps Italian Americans had finally become \\"American enough that we can afford to be Italian.\\" Through her poetry and editing, Romano became a key figure in the newly developing field of Italian-American lesbian and feminist writing. She was the first Italian- American lesbian to present papers to the American Italian Historical Association that spoke of her experiences as an Italian-American lesbian. She has published three novels, You'll never have me like you want me (2016), Beyond the Leash (2017), and In braccio alla mamma (2019), several books of poetry, including Neither Seen nor Heard (2016).

Arabic dances are very diverse and have many different styles, including the three main types of folklore, classical, and contemporary. It is enjoyed and implemented throughout the Arab region, from North Africa to the Middle East. To the outside world, the term \\"Arabic dance\\" is often associated with the belly dance; however, there are other many styles of Arabic dances and many of them have a long history. These may be folk dances, or dances that were once performed as rituals or as entertainment spectacle, and some may have been performed in the imperial court. Coalescence of oral storytelling, poetry recital, and music has a long-standing tradition in Arab history. Among the best-known of the Arab traditional dances are the belly dance, the ardah, and the dabke. Traditional dancing is still popular among expatriate Arabs and has also been successfully exported to international folk dance groups all over the world. All dancers wear the traditional costume to embody the history of their culture and tell their ancestors stories.  History  A dancer dancing Raqs Baladi in Cairo Historically, dance has always been an important part of the Arabic culture. Some examples of the oldest social dances enjoyed in the Arab world are Debke () and Raqs Baladi (; relative-adjective \\"of town\\", \\"local\\", \\"rural\\", comparable to English \\"folk\\", with a lower-class connotation). During the series of invasions on the Arab world, Europeans were influenced by its peoples cultures. During the French campaign in Egypt and Syria in 1798, Europeans were interested in the Arab world, folk dances and music of each country. In the middle of the 19th century, the Middle East, especially the Levant, Mesopotamia and Egypt were collectively referred to as the 'East'. The Middle East attracted European painters and writers described as Orientalists, who specialized in Oriental subjects; among the most prominent personalities are Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me, Eug√®ne Delacroix and Jean- Auguste-Dominique Ingres. Orientalism has undoubtedly contributed to the misconception of the popular dance as a dance of temptation, conducted for the pleasure of men. In fact, because of the traditional gender segregation, women in the Middle East usually dance only in the women's company between parents and friends. Sometimes a professional dancer and musicians were invited to the women's Caucus. Today, gender segregation is not strictly practised in many urban areas, and sometimes both men and women dance socially at family and/or community events. Arabic dance was performed in the United States in 1893 at the World's Columbian Exposition, which included an exhibition entitled \\"The streets of Cairo\\". The exhibition was attended by dancers from several Arab countries from the Middle East and North Africa, including Syria and Algeria. The term \\"belly dancing\\" is often credited to Sol Bloom, its entertainment director, but referred to the dance as danse du ventre, the name used by the French in Algeria. In his memoirs, Bloom states, \\"when the public learned that the literal translation was \\"belly dance\\", they delightedly concluded that it must be salacious and immoral...I had a gold mine.\\"Donna Carlton (1995) Looking for Little Egypt. Bloomington, Indiana: International Dance Discovery Books. .  Types of dance  Arabs have their own music and dance which is part of their identity.

Bengali forces defeated Burmese forces and installed Min Saw Mon as the ruler of Mrauk U. As a result of the victory, Arakan became a vassal state of the Bengal Sultanate. Background In 1406, Burmese forces from the Kingdom of Ava invaded Arakan. Arakan was later divided between the Ava kingdom and the powerful Hanthawaddy Kingdom of Lower Burma. The former Arakanese ruler Min Saw Mon received asylum in the Bengal Sultanate and lived there for 24 years. Saw Mon became close to the Bengal Sultan Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah, serving as a commander in the king's army. Saw Mon convinced the sultan to help reconquer Arakan from the Burmese.Sandamala Linkara Vol. 2: 11 Invasion In 1429, General Wali Khan led an army to invade Arakan sent by Bengal Sultanate.Myint-U 2006: 73 Min Saw Mon was proclaimed king in Launggyet on 18 April 1429.

Aftermath The Bengalis established settlements in Arakan following the reconquest. Arakanese kings adopted Islamic titles and fashioned themselves after Bengali rulers.

Built in 1969 as a gift from the Republic of China (Taiwan) in the style of a traditional Chinese pailou , it became one of the most photographed locations in Chinatown, along with the older Sing Fat and Sing Chong buildings (at Grant and California). History In 1953, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce sponsored a bilingual essay contest on how to improve Chinatown business, in the wake of an U.S. embargo on mainland China imports after the People's Republic of China entered the Korean conflict. The winner of the English division, Charles L. Leong, suggested in his essay, among many things, the erection of an authentic archway to Chinatown at Bush and Grant. A later report from 1963 proposing general plans for the downtown area noted that \\"north of Bush Street, Grant Avenue, to the casual observer and the visitor, is Chinatown\\", establishing the site's suitability. In 1956, the Chinatown Improvement Committee, appointed by Mayor George Christopher, made the archway its top priority, but further progress was stalled; an early effort to build a gate which started in 1958 was suspended in 1961 after funds and materials ran short, then abandoned in 1962. The gate was redesigned in 1963 by Lun Chan, Worley Wong, Morton Rader, and Piero Patri as part of a more ambitious plan to link Chinatown and North Beach via a pedestrian mall and bridge. In 1967 Mayor John F. Shelley, Mayor Christopher's successor, also championed the project and sponsored a design competition. This contest to design a gateway was won by a team of three Chinese-Americans, landscape architects Melvin H. Lee (design concept), Joseph Yee, along with architect Clayton Lee, who were inspired by Chinese village architecture of ceremonial gates. There were twenty entrants in the contest, judged by a jury of five. Materials for the gateway, viz., 120 artisanal ochre tiles, were donated by the Republic of China (Taiwan) in 1969. Although the gateway was largely completed by April 1969, it was not dedicated until October 18, 1970; Mayor Joseph Alioto, Mayor Shelly's successor, and Vice-President Yen Chia-kan of the Republic of China (Taiwan) attended the ceremony. The Dragon Gate, with its inscription by Sun Yat-sen, has been described as embodying \\"the ROC government['s] symbolic claim on Chinatown\\", before the People's Republic of China gained more influence in Chinatown following Nixon's 1972 visit to China and further normalization of US-China relations. Design Like most Chinese ceremonial gates, the Chinatown Gateway has three portals facing south. The two smaller west and east (pedestrian) portals flank the larger central (automotive) portal, and the structure is supported on stone columns rising from the sidewalks on either side of Grant. The stone columns adhere to standards for Chinese gateways; in contrast, most 'Chinese' gateways constructed in the United States use wooden support columns. Each portal is covered with green tiles, leading north along Grant Avenue into Chinatown. Three shallow steps lead up to each pedestrian portal. Each pedestrian portal features a stone Chinese guardian lion on the side away from the street. By tradition, the lion pair consists of one male and one female. The male lion, at the west portal, stands with his right fore paw atop a pearl or stone, symbolically guarding the structure or empire. The female lion, at the east portal, stands with her left fore paw atop a juvenile lion, symbolically guarding the occupants within. There are also fish and dragons atop the gate; the fish symbolize prosperity, while the dragons symbolize power and fertility. Between the dragons is a ball, symbolizing the earth. There are four Chinese characters above each portal. Each sign is read from right to left. The central portal sign reads (a motto attributed to Dr. Sun Yat-sen); the east portal sign reads ; and the west reads .

Education and early career Wybrants earned an AFA at Sullins College (1961‚Äì63), a BFA at Ohio Wesleyan University (1963‚Äì65), and an MA in Painting, Fine Art at Hunter College (1972‚Äì74). In 1973, using the married name Sharon Wybrants-Lynch, she was a founding artist- member of SOHO20 Gallery, the second all-women cooperative exhibition space in New York City. She remained with the gallery until 1978. Her first solo show at SOHO20, in December 1973, was favorably reviewed in Arts Magazine. She exhibited paintings and drawings of \\"vigorous, creative women whose faces defy any judgment based on culturally-defined standards of feminine beauty,\\" including an expressive self-portrait called Revolutionary Woman (1973), which was later acquired by Western Illinois University. For her second solo exhibition at SOHO20, Wybrants showed painted \\"images of exaggerated feminine sensibility,\\" and again received a positive review in Arts Magazine. Wybrants also exhibited in group shows, including The Eye of Woman (1974, Hobart and William Smith Colleges) and Year of the Woman (1975, Bronx Museum of the Arts). In 1974, she received the Childe Hassam Purchase Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Self-portraits In a group show at SOHO20 called Showing Off (1975), Wybrants exhibited Self-Portrait as Superwoman (Woman as Culture Hero) (1975), a ten-foot-high pastel study for a projected monumental oil painting that the critic John Perreault described as \\"more than slightly tongue-in-cheek. But it demonstrates that women artists have egos too, sometimes just as big as any man's. And why shouldn‚Äôt they?\\" Also on view was another pastel, Wybrants‚Äôs Self-Portrait in Superwoman Costume with Rauschenberg in the Background (1975), which humorously shows the artist with a picture of Robert Rauschenberg tacked to the wall behind her like a pin-up. The oil version of Self-Portrait as Superwoman (Woman as Culture Hero) (1977‚Äì78) was intended for The Sister Chapel, a collaborative feminist installation that celebrated eleven historic, mythical, and conceptual female \\"role models.\\" Wybrants's self-portrait is a tribute to her own achievements as a woman and as an artist, but it was also intended to communicate something of the uncertainty and personal suffering behind the groundbreaking accomplishments of the feminist art movement. Although the original Self-Portrait as Superwoman disappeared in the 1980s after it was purportedly taken to the local dump, Wybrants recreated the painting for a new exhibition of The Sister Chapel at Rowan University Art Gallery in 2016. In 1976, the pastel version of Self-Portrait as Superwoman was used as the image on a poster to promote an Equal Rights Amendment Work Conference sponsored by the New York chapter of the National Organization for Women. The pastel version was also exhibited a second time at SOHO20 in Superwoman, Beauty and the Beast, Wybrants‚Äôs third solo show at the gallery. Also displayed was a series of twelve self-portraits that documented the year-long breakup of Wybrants's marriage, each reflecting \\"a different mood and a different way of seeing herself,\\" as noted by the art critic Ellen Lubell. The paintings ranged from During the Separation (1976), which Marjorie Kramer likened to \\"a wild animal looking for possible dangers,\\" to Cathartic Conversation with Al Hansen (1976), which is looser and far less constrained. Wybrants's twelve self- portraits were praised by reviewers in Arts Magazine, ARTnews, The Feminist Art Journal, Womanart, and The SoHo Weekly News. Performance art Between 1978 and 1980, Wybrants created a number of performances in addition to working as a painter. Master Lady and Her Four Master Pieces (1980), for example, featured Wybrants being dragged around a stage by a group of young men on leashes who were wearing bondage-type costumes. For some of her performances, Wybrants collaborated with colleagues, including the artist and designer Dan Kainen. Later career While living in Woodstock, New York between 1981 and 1984, Wybrants hosted a weekly cable television talk show called \\"Fire, It's a Verb.\\" According to her, \\"While we talked, I'd draw my guest's pastel portrait that showed on the live video. It was a bit of a challenge to complete it in a half hour, to have it look good all the time, and conduct an interview.\\" In 1990, Wybrants was the founding director of Challenged Artists Together, a non-profit art organization for children, adolescents, and adults with disabilities in Las Cruces, New Mexico. By 1992, the program served thirty adults and fourteen children. Wybrants taught studio art, digital art, and art history at the Berkshire School from 1997 until 2009. Between 1981 and 2012, her works were exhibited in Puerto Rico, New Mexico, Massachusetts, Illinois, New York, and Italy. In 2010, Wybrants was awarded an artist residency at the Millay Colony for the Arts. She continues to paint and still creates self-portraits, one of which was recently exhibited in Selfies & Self-Portraits: 21st C Artists See Themselves (2017) at Viridian Artists in New York City.

People of certain religious and ethnic groups also have their own specific practices. Thai Buddhist funerals generally consist of a bathing ceremony shortly after death, daily chanting by Buddhist monks, and a cremation ceremony. Cremation is practised by most peoples throughout the country, with the major exceptions being ethnic Chinese, Muslims and Christians. Thai Buddhist funerals While variations exist among the cultures of Thailand's different regions, most Buddhist funerals generally include the same common basic features. The first ritual following death is the bathing ceremony. Today, it more commonly takes place as a ceremonial pouring of water. Guests to the ceremony will, one by one, pour water infused with lustral water over the hand of the deceased. Following the bathing ceremony, the hair is ritually combed and the body dressed and placed in the coffin; the undertaker will perform certain rituals during the process. The coffin is then placed on display for merit making, and daily rites are held, with monks invited to chant the Abhidhamma. This was traditionally held at the home, but today it usually takes place at a Buddhist temple (wat). Such rites are usually held for three, five or seven consecutive days. An important ritual during such funeral rites is bangsukun (, from Pali pa·πÉsuk≈´la)‚Äîthe offering of cloth to monks on behalf of the dead. The body is finally disposed of in a cremation ceremony, which takes place at a temple's crematorium (called men () in Thai for their symbolisation of Mount Meru). Sometimes, this will be held after waiting a certain period (e.g. 100 days or a year following death). Merit-making rites are also held at 7, 50 and 100 days after death.Department of Fine Arts. Reproduced in Royal sponsorship Royal sponsorship of funerals may be granted by the king, usually to government officials and high-ranking members of the country's honours system. These most often take the form of royally sponsored cremations or burials (granted in the form of royal flames or burial soil) and royally bestowed bathing water. Persons of high-standing may also be bestowed the use of a kot () or funerary urn, which is an upright container used in place of a coffin, and the king or appointed members of the royal family may attend certain funerals in person.  Funerals of senior Buddhist clergy and government officials Government officials and distinguished armed forces and police personnel, as well as religious leaders, usually lie in state in Wat Ratchanatdaram or in other major Bangkok Buddhist temples (as well as in major provincial temples). While the lying-in-state for government officials and retired military and police personnel last from either 2 weeks to 5‚Äì7 months, the lying-in-state for senior members of the Buddhist clergy can last from 6‚Äì8 months to two years, with Buddhist services led by monks with prayers made while using the pha yong or memorial ribbon attached to the urn held 3 to 4 times a day with chanting by 4 monks (for lay funerals) or 8 for clergical funerals also being performed. If necessary the Flag of Thailand is lowered to half-mast. A piphat nang hong and/or piphat Mon traditional ensemble plays in these events, while in some funerals the instruments of the piphat are combined with Western musical instruments. When the 100-day mark for state funerals is reached, special commemorative books, pamphlets, and flyers containing Buddhist doctrines and on the funeral service are commissioned and special services are held. Once everything is set for cremation as per Buddhist and Hindu customs, the cremation proper begins with one final late- night service for the decreased officially kicking off the cremation services. The funeral procession is held from the temple or funeral hall towards the nearest crematorium. For senior state, military and police officials the Royal Thai Armed Forces and the Royal Thai Police provide the funeral escort detachment, buglers, and the military band (plus a firing party and for high- ranking officers an artillery battery). For senior and high-ranking Buddhist clergymen the King's Guards Corps or units of the RTAF and/or the RTP can be ordered to provide the funeral escorts and the massed bands, while other RTAF personnel serve as linemen and the BRH provides the traditional funeral carriage if the funeral is for the Supreme Patriarch of Thailand. The cremation proper is then held in the evening, and on the following day the ashes of the deceased are obtained, a breakfast service is held and the ashes are transferred, some to the temple and others to the residence of the deceased, for deceased Buddhist clergymen their ashes and relics are interred in the nearest temple. For funerals of government officials and distinguished armed forces and police personnel a three-volley salute is fired, while for senior high-ranking officials a gun salute is fired: * 15 for all other general, flag and air general officers and other ministers of state * 17 for the Chief of Defense Forces, the Commanders of the Army, Navy and Air Force and the Commissioner General of Police and provincial governors, all if deceased while in office as well as for former provincial governors and all retired former Chiefs of Defense Forces, Commanders of the Army, Navy and Air Force and Commissioner Generals of Police, for a deceased serving or former Deputy Prime Minister or Minister of Defence * 19 for a deceased serving or former Prime Minister of Thailand Maha Chai is played by a marching band during the honors for a deceased Prime Minister while for all other officials and all general and police officers including general officers, flag officers and air general officers Maha Roek can be played as a General Salute tune. Royal funerals Funerals of members of the royal family are grand elaborate events, organised as a royal ceremony and akin to a state funeral. The grandest events most notably involve a royal cremation ceremony in a purpose- built phra merumat (, royal crematorium) in the royal field of Sanam Luang in Bangkok's historic centre. These grand funerals are for the King, Queen, and senior-ranked members of the Royal Family. Expenses Thai funerals can be an elaborate event; hosts are expected to provide meals for the guests, and historically, theatrical entertainment was provided by those of higher status. Although modern funerals are usually more solemn, in some rural areas the entertaining of guests still plays an important role. The Thai language includes such idioms as khon tai khai khon pen (, lit. \\"the dead sell the living\\"), referring to the act of hosting expensive funerals plunging living descendants into debt.

Tang-e Gharu, also known as Tang-e Gharo (Pashto: ÿ™ŸÜ⁄Ø ÿ∫ÿßÿ±Ÿà), is a gorge and a mountain pass in the Hindu Kush mountain range of Kabul Province, Afghanistan. The Kabul River passes through the gorge, flowing eastward. The Kabul‚ÄìJalalabad Road runs through the gorge, parallel to the river. Construction on the road began in the 1940s and was completed in the 1960s replacing the ancient Lataband Pass mountain pass. Both the pass and the road are considered to be of major strategic importance, as they provide a connection to Pakistan and Russia. Due to heavy usage during recent conflicts in Afghanistan and frequent traffic accidents, the pass and the surrounding areas have become heavily damaged and periodically closed off.  Geology  The cliffs of Tang-e Gharu gorge are a blue-grey limestone, which was formed some 250 million years ago. However, the gorge itself is only about 2 million years old and was formed as a combination of water erosion from the river and the collapse of an underground river channel.

Early life and education Chizumila was born on 14 May 1953 in Zomba, Malawi. Her father, George Michongwe, was a senior civil servant who was assigned to the Malawi Delegation at the United Nations in New York in 1964. After the Cabinet Crisis of 1964 in Malawi, the family fled into exile in 1966, settling as refugees in Tanzania. She has a bachelor's degree in law from the University of Dar es Salaam, and a master's degree in International Law, obtained in Germany. Career Chizumila and her two sons returned to Malawi in 1988, where she worked for Save the Children for eighteen months while waiting for a security clearance because she was the child of a \\"rebel.\\" She was then directed by Hastings Banda to report to the Minister of Justice as a State Advocate. She was later the first woman to establish a law firm in Malawi. In 2000, Chizumila was appointed as Malawi's High Commissioner to Zimbabwe. She was appointed as a judge of the High Court of Malawi in 2003 by President Bakili Muluzi.

Early life and education Gunter was born in Winnipeg, Canada. A positive experience at the hospital when she was eleven and had a skateboard accident motivated her to decide on a career in health care: declining sedation, she watched the hospital staff perform an angiogram on her ruptured spleen as they explained the procedure to her. From 1984 to 1986, Gunter studied at the University of Winnipeg until being accepted into medical school in 1986. In 1990, Gunter graduated from the University of Manitoba College of Medicine. From 1990 to 1995, she completed obstetrics and gynecology training at the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario. In 1995, Gunter moved to the United States for a fellowship in infectious diseases and women's health at the University of Kansas Medical Center where she also developed an interest in the area of pain management. Career Doctor From 1996 to 2001, Gunter worked at the University of Kansas Medical Center for an additional five years after the one year fellowship ended. In 2001, Gunter worked as a lecturer at the University of Colorado Hospital in Denver, Colorado. During this time the miscarriage of one of Gunter's sons in a triplet pregnancy she described as traumatic made her decide to shift her work away from the field of obstetrics. Instead she focused on gynecology, specializing in vaginal and vulval conditions. Gunter has practiced medicine since 1996. Gunter works as an OB/GYN and a pain medicine physician. Her approach is based on evidence-based medicine integrated with a focus on empathy and the patient experience, which Gunter said she learned from the University of Western Ontario, and the adjacency to McMaster University Medical School, which is a center of evidence-based medicine. Since 2006, she has been at The Permanente Medical Group of Kaiser Permanente in Northern California. At Kaiser, Gunter manages a health clinic for women in the Chronic Pelvic Pain & Vulvo-Vaginal Disorders division. Author Around 2004, Gunter delivered triplets prematurely: one was born at just 22 weeks and did not survive and the other two were born at 26 weeks. The lack of publicly available, medically sound information about the particular needs of premature babies motivated her to write a book entitled, The Preemie Primer: A Complete Guide for Parents of Premature Babies ‚Äî from Birth through the Toddler Years and Beyond. Since 2011, Gunter has written a blog that has reached 15 million views and has generated controversies in the mainstream media. Gunter has been critical of dubious health claims made by celebrities and the careless way that media outlets report on matters such as reproductive health and vaccination. She advocates for more responsible health coverage by the news media, less weight given to health advice by celebrities and for doctors to communicate better with their patients. In June 2019, The Lancet published an opinion piece by Gunter calling for \\"a better medical internet\\" by having more medical experts involved in disseminating adequate medical information to the public. \\"It is simply not acceptable to me that quality research that can save lives and reduce suffering could be undone by a medical conspiracy theorist or a celebrity looking to sell supplements.\\" Gunter writes two regular columns on women‚Äôs health at The New York Times: a monthly column called \\"The Cycle\\" and a weekly column called \\"You Asked\\". Gunter is known by the nickname \\"Twitter's Resident Gynecologist\\", and has used Twitter to share information about pain management and to debunk myths about women's health. As of 2019, her Twitter account reaches over 200,000 followers. The Vagina Bible In 2019, Gunter's second book, The Vagina Bible, was published. The book presents medical information about female reproductive anatomy and corrects common myths. Writing the book is a reaction to what she sees as a large amount of dangerous false information on the web about female health. The book includes a section focusing on trans men and women. The title reached #1 on the list of Canadian nonfiction bestsellers, according to the Retail Council of Canada. During promotion of the book, there was controversy when the publisher's Twitter advertisements were blocked for use of inappropriate language (presumably the word vagina). The ads were only allowed to run after a large online conversation developed. In a 2019 review by doctor Harriet Hall, she states that \\"Dr. Jen Gunter has done women everywhere a great service by writing\\" this book. Hall calls Gunter the perfect person to write this with her years in medicine and gynecology as well as being a \\"gifted communicator\\". Hall calls The Vagina Bible a \\"owner's manual for the vagina ... I wish every girl and woman everywhere had a copy of this book.\\" Gunter has said she is working on her next book, which will be called The Menopause Manifesto. Popular culture As a doctor, Gunter has spoken out on a variety of topics affecting women's health, including abortion, the HPV vaccine, and the use of fetal tissue in research. Gunter corrects misconceptions about women's health through her books, newspaper column and online discussions. In 2015, Gunter's blog post critical over an article in the Toronto Star which mischaracterized the safety of Gardasil, a HPV vaccine, resulted in an apology by Toronto Star. There was additional discussion and scrutiny over the coverage of vaccine safety in the mainstream press. Goop Gunter is a long-time critic of products sold by Goop, the company owned by actress Gwyneth Paltrow. Her criticism of one of Goop's products, a jade egg meant to be inserted in one's vagina, came to the attention of a wider audience when her blog post of January 17, 2017, was picked up by a tabloid newspaper. Additional posts elicited a written response from Goop directly responding to Gunter's criticism. Goop also eventually paid consumer protection fines and refunded the cost of vaginal eggs to customers who purchased them. This exchange provoked an intervention by Timothy Caulfield, a Canada research chair in health law and policy at the University of Alberta, who supported Gunter's position. Caulfield stated that, \\"studies have consistently found, for example, that celebrities can have a measurable and less-than-ideal impact on everything from cancer screening to smoking to the food that we eat.\\" In October 2018, Gunter and archeologist Sarah Parcak published a study to investigate whether or not jade eggs were used vaginally in ancient China, as Goop's marketing claims they were. A review of the description of 5,000 artifacts available in major databases of Chinese archeology found no mention of such an object. Jensplaining In June 2019, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation announced the 10-part docuseries called Jensplaining would be airing on their free streaming network called CBC Gem in August 2019. The series will be ten episodes, with the first three covering menstruation, wellness, and vaccines. Personal life Gunter has been married twice. Gunter is divorced from her second husband. Gunter and her twin sons have lived in Northern California since 2005. The third son of what would have been triplets miscarried at 22 weeks. Gunter has spoken about her struggles with a lifelong binge eating disorder and said she has considered writing a book about weight loss.

The park protects of relatively pristine marine ecosystem in the central Sea of Cortez, including five large uninhabited islands and many smaller islets in Loreto Bay. It is known for its great variety of coastal environments, such as sandy beaches, sea cliffs, submarine canyons, and marine terraces, and is home to an exceptionally high biological diversity, especially of marine mammals. The national park was created by federal decree on July 19, 1996, and is administered by the Natural Commission of Protected Natural Areas (CONANP), an agency of Mexico's Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources. In 2004, it joined the Ramsar list of Wetlands of International Importance, and in 2005, it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site collectively with many other protected areas in the Gulf of California. Description Bah√≠a de Loreto National Park protects Loreto Bay, located in northwest Mexico off the coast of Loreto Municipality in the state of Baja California Sur; the city of Loreto abuts park territory. The park covers an area of , 88% of which is ocean surface; the islands, islets, and coastal regions that comprise the remaining 12% are mostly uninhabited. Five main islands serve as the park's chief focal points and tourist destinations: Isla Coronados, Isla del Carmen, Isla Danzante, Isla Monserrat, and Isla Santa Catalina. Though the municipality of Loreto is not within park boundaries, it is the primary starting point for tours of the park and is considered a major influence on the area's ecology.

To a large extent this study is organic geochemistry, but it also includes the very important carbon dioxide. Carbon is transformed by life, and moves between the major phases of the Earth, including the water bodies, atmosphere, and the rocky parts. Carbon is important in the formation of organic mineral deposits, such as coal, petroleum or natural gas. Most carbon is cycled through the atmosphere into living organisms and then respirated back into the atmosphere. However an important part of the carbon cycle involves the trapping of living matter into sediments. The carbon then becomes part of a sedimentary rock when lithification happens. Human technology or natural processes such as weathering, or underground life or water can return the carbon from sedimentary rocks to the atmosphere. From that point it can be transformed in the rock cycle into metamorphic rocks, or melted into igneous rocks. Carbon can return to the surface of the Earth by volcanoes or via uplift in tectonic processes. Carbon is returned to the atmosphere via volcanic gases. Carbon undergoes transformation in the mantle under pressure to diamond and other minerals, and also exists in the Earth's outer core in solution with iron, and may also be present in the inner core. Carbon can form a huge variety stable compounds. It is an essential component of living matter. Living organisms can live in a limited range of conditions on the Earth that are limited by temperature and the existence of liquid water. The potential habitability of other planets or moons can also be assessed by the existence of liquid water. Carbon makes up only 0.08% of the combination of the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere. Yet it is the twelfth most common element there. In the rock of the lithosphere, carbon commonly occurs as carbonate minerals containing calcium or magnesium. It is also found as fossil fuels in coal and petroleum and gas. Native forms of carbon are much rarer, requiring pressure to form. Pure carbon exists as graphite or diamond. The deeper parts of Earth such as the mantle are very hard to discover. Few samples are known, in the form of uplifted rocks, or xenoliths. Even fewer remain in the same state they were in where the pressure and temperature is much higher. Some diamonds retain inclusions held at pressures they were formed at, but the temperature is much lower at the surface. Iron meteorites may represent samples of the core of an asteroid, but it would have formed under different conditions to the Earth's core. Therefore, experimental studies are conducted in which minerals or substances are compressed and heated to determine what happens in similar conditions to the planetary interior. The two common isotopes of carbon are stable. On Earth, carbon 12, 12C is by far the most common at 98.894%. Carbon 13 is much rarer averaging 1.106%. This percentage can vary slightly and its value is important in isotope geochemistry whereby the origin of the carbon is suggested. Origins Formation Carbon can be produced in stars at least as massive as the Sun by fusion of three helium-4 nuclei: 4He + 4He + 4He --> 12C. This is the triple alpha process. In stars as massive as the Sun, carbon 12 is also converted to carbon 13 and then onto nitrogen 14 by fusion with protons. 12C + 1H --> 13C + e+. 13C + 1H --> 14N. In more massive stars, two carbon nuclei can fuse to magnesium, or a carbon and an oxygen to sulfur. Astrochemistry In molecular clouds, simple carbon molecules are formed, including carbon monoxide and dicarbon. Reactions with the trihydrogen cation of the simple carbon molecules yield carbon containing ions that readily react to form larger organic molecules. Carbon compounds that exist as ions, or isolated gas molecules in the interstellar medium, can condense onto dust grains. Carbonaceous dust grains consist mostly of carbon. Grains can stick together to form larger aggregates. Earth formation Meteorites and interplanetary dust shows the composition of solid material at the start of the Solar System, as they have not been modified since its formation. Carbonaceous chondrites are meteorites with around 5% carbon compounds. Their composition resembles the Sun's minus the very volatile elements like hydrogen and noble gases. The Earth is believed to have formed by the gravitational collapse of material like meteorites. Important effects on Earth in the first Hadian Era include strong solar winds during the T-Tauri stage of the Sun. The Moon forming impact caused major changes to the surface. Juvenile volatiles outgased from the early molten surface of the Earth. These included carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. The emissions probably did not include methane, but the Earth was probably free of molecular oxygen. The Late Heavy Bombardment was between 4.0 and 3.8 billion years ago (Ga). To start with, the Earth did not have a crust as it does today. Plate tectonics in its present form commenced about 2.5 Ga. Early sedimentary rocks formed under water date to 3.8 Ga. Pillow lavas dating from 3.5 Ga prove the existence of oceans. Evidence of early life is given by fossils of stromatolites, and later by chemical tracers. Organic matter continues to be added to the Earth from space via interplanetary dust, which also includes some interstellar particles. The amounts added to the Earth were around 60,000 tonnes per year about 4 Ga. Isotope Biological sequestration of carbon causes enrichment of carbon-12, so that substances that originate from living organisms have a higher carbon-12 content. Due to the kinetic isotope effect, chemical reactions can happen faster with lighter isotopes, so that photosynthesis fixes lighter carbon-12 faster than carbon-13. Also lighter isotopes diffuse across a biological membrane faster. Enrichment in carbon 13 is measured by delta 13C(o/oo) = [(13C/12C)sample/(13C/12C)standard - 1] * 1000. The common standard for carbon is Cretaceous Peedee formation belemnite. Stereoisomers Complex molecules, in particular those containing carbon can be in the form of stereoisomers. With abiotic processes they would be expected to be equally likely, but in carbonaceous chondrites this is not the case. The reasons for this are unknown. Crust The outer layer of the Earth, the crust along with its outer layers contain about 1020 kg of carbon. This is enough for each square meter of the surface to have 200 tons of carbon. Sedimentation Carbon added to sedimentary rocks can take the form of carbonates, or organic carbon compounds. In order of source quantity the organic carbon comes from phytoplankton, plants, bacteria and zooplankton. However terrestrial sediments may be mostly from higher plants, and some oxygen deficient sediments from water may be mostly bacteria. Fungi and other animals make insignificant contributions.Killops page 24 On the oceans the main contributor of organic matter to sediments is plankton, either dead fragments or faecal pellets termed marine snow. Bacteria degrade this matter in the water column, and the amount surviving to the ocean floor is inversely proportional to the depth. This is accompanied by biominerals consisting of silicates and carbonates. The particulate organic matter in sediments is about 20% of known molecules 80% of material that cannot be analysed. Detritivores consume some of the fallen organic materials. Aerobic bacteria and fungi also consume organic matter in the oxic surface parts of the sediment. Coarse- grained sediments are oxygenated to about half a meter, but fine grained clays may only have a couple of millimetres exposed to oxygen. The organic matter in the oxygenated zone will become completely mineralized if it stays there long enough. Deeper in sediments where oxygen is exhausted, anaerobic biological processes continue at a slower rate. These include anaerobic mineralization making ammonium, phosphate and sulfide ions; fermentation making short chain alcohols, acids or methyl amines; acetogenesis making acetic acid; methanogenesis making methane, and sulfate, nitrite and nitrate reduction. Carbon dioxide and hydrogen are also outputs. Under freshwater, sulfate is usually very low, so methanogensis is more important. Yet other bacteria can convert methane, back into living matter, by oxidising with other substrates. Bacteria can reside at great depths in sediments. However sedimentary organic matter accumulates the indigestible components. Deep bacteria may be lithotrophes, using hydrogen, and carbon dioxide as a carbon source. In the oceans and other waters there is much dissolved organic materials. These are several thousand years old on average, and are called gelbstoff (yellow substance) particularly in fresh waters. Much of this is tannins. The nitrogen containing materials here appear to be amides, perhaps from peptidoglycans from bacteria. Microorganisms have trouble consuming the high molecular weight dissolved substances, but quickly consume small molecules. From terrestrial sources black carbon produced by charring is an important component. Fungi are important decomposers in soil. Macromolecules Proteins are normally hydrolysed slowly even without enzymes or bacteria, with a half life of 460 years, but can be preserved if they are desiccated, pickled or frozen. Being enclosed in bone also helps preservation. Over time the amino acids tend to racemize, and those with more functional groups are lost earlier. Protein still will degrade on the timescale of a million years. DNA degrades rapidly, lasting only about four years in water. Cellulose and chitin have a half life in water at 25¬∞ of about 4.7 million years. Enzymes can accelerate this by a factor of 1017. About 1011 tons of chiting are produced each year, but it is almost all degraded. Lignin is only efficiently degraded by fungi, white rot, or brown rot. These require oxygen. Lipids are hydrolysed to fatty acids over long time periods. Plant cuticle waxes are very difficult to degrade, and may survive over geological time periods. Preservation More organic matter is preserved in sediments if there is high primary production, or the sediment is fine-grained. The lack of oxygen helps preservation greatly, and that also is caused by a large supply of organic matter. Soil does not usually preserve organic matter, it would need to be acidified or water logged, as in the bog. Rapid burial ensures the material gets to an oxygen free depth, but also dilutes the organic matter. A low energy environment ensures the sediment is not stirred up and oxygenated. Salt marshes and mangroves meet some of these requirements, but unless the sea level is rising will not have a chance to accumulate much. Coral reefs are very productive, but are well oxygenated, and recycle everything before it is buried. Sphagnum bog In dead Sphagnum, sphagnan a polysaccharide with D-lyxo-5-hexosulouronic acid is a major remaining substance. It makes the bog very acidic, so that bacteria cannot grow. Not only that, the plant ensures there is no available nitrogen. Holocellulose also absorbs any digestive enzymes around. Together this leads to major accumulation of peat under sphagnum bogs. Mantle Earth's mantle is a significant reservoir of carbon. The mantle contains more carbon than the crust, oceans, biosphere, and atmosphere put together. The figure is estimated to be very roughly 1022 kg. Carbon concentration in the mantle is very variable, varying by more than a factor of 100 between different parts. The form carbon takes depends on its oxidation state, which depends on the oxygen fugacity of the environment. Carbon dioxide and carbonate are found where the oxygen fugacity is high. Lower oxygen fugacity results in diamond formation, first in eclogite, then peridotite, and lastly in fluid water mixtures. At even lower oxygen fugacity, methane is stable in contact with water, and even lower, metallic iron and nickel form along with carbides. Iron carbides include Fe3C and Fe7C3. Minerals that contain carbon include calcite and its higher density polymorphs. Other significant carbon minerals include magnesium and iron carbonates. Dolomite is stable above 100 km depth. Below 100 km, dolomite reacts with orthopyroxine (found in peridotite) to yield magnesite (an iron magnesium carbonate). Below 200 km deep, carbon dioxide is reduced by ferrous iron (Fe2+), forming diamond, and ferric iron (Fe3+). Even deeper pressure induced disproportionation of iron minerals produces more ferric iron, and metallic iron. The metallic iron combines with carbon to form the mineral cohenite with formula Fe3C. Cohenite also contains some nickel substituting for iron. This form or carbon is called \\"carbide\\". Diamond forms in the mantle below 150 km deep, but because it is so durable, it can survive in eruptions to the surface in kimberlites, lamproites, or ultramafic lamprophyres. Xenoliths can come from the mantle, and different compositions come from different depths. Above 90 km (3.2 GPa) spinel peridotite occurs, below this garnet peridotite is found. Inclusions trapped in diamond can reveal the material and conditions much deeper in the mantle. Large gem diamonds are usually formed in the transition zone part of the mantle, (410 to 660 km deep) and crystallise from a molten iron-nickel-carbon solution, that also contains sulfur and trace amounts of hydrogen, chromium, phosphorus and oxygen. Carbon atoms constitute about 12% of the melt (about 3% by mass). Inclusions of the crystallised metallic melt are sometimes included in diamonds. Diamond can be caused to precipitate from the liquid metal, by increasing pressure, or by adding sulfur. Fluid inclusions in crystals from the mantle have contents that most often are liquid carbon dioxide, but which also include carbon oxysulfide, methane and carbon monoxide Material is added by subduction from the crust. This includes the major carbon containing sediments such as limestone, or coal. Each year 2√ó1011 kg of CO2 is transferred from the crust to the mantle by subduction. (1700 tons of carbon per second). Upwelling mantle material can add to the crust at mid oceanic ridges. Fluids can extract carbon from the mantle and erupt in volcanoes. At 330 km deep a liquid consisting of carbon dioxide and water can form. It is highly corrosive, and dissolves incompatible elements from the solid mantle. These elements include uranium, thorium, potassium, helium and argon. The fluids can then go on to cause metasomatism or extend to the surface in carbonatite eruptions. The total mid oceanic ridge, and hot spot volcanic emissions of carbon dioxide match the loss due to subduction: 2√ó1011 kg of CO2 per year. In slowly convecting mantle rocks, diamond that slowly rises above 150 km will slowly turn into graphite or be oxidised to carbon dioxide or carbonate minerals. Core Earth's core is believed to be mostly an alloy of iron and nickel. The density indicates that it also contains a significant amount of lighter elements. Elements such as hydrogen would be stable in the Earth's core, however the conditions at the formation of the core would not be suitable for its inclusion. Carbon is a very likely constituent of the core. Preferential partitioning of the carbon isotope12C into the metallic core, during its formation, may explain why there seems to be more 13C on the surface and mantle of the Earth compared to other solar system bodies (‚àí5‚Ä∞ compared to -20‚Ä∞). The difference can also help to predict the value of the carbon proportion of the core. The outer core has a density around 11 cm‚àí3, and a mass of 1.3√ó1024kg. It contains roughly 1022 kg of carbon. Carbon dissolved in liquid iron affect the solution of other elements. Dissolved carbon changes lead from a siderophile to a lithophile. It has the opposite effect on tungsten and molybdenum, causing more tungsten or molybdenum to dissolve in the metallic phase. The measured amounts of these elements in the rocks compared to the Solar System can be explained by a 0.6% carbon composition of the core. The inner core is about 1221 km in radius. It has a density of 13 g cm‚àí3, and a total mass of 9√ó1022 kg and a surface area of 18,000,000 square kilometers. Experiments with mixtures under pressure and temperature attempt to reproduce the known properties of the inner and outer core. Carbides are among the first to precipitate from a molten metal mix, and so the inner core may be mostly iron carbides, Fe7C3 or Fe3C. At atmospheric pressure (100 kPa) the iron-Fe3C eutectic point is at 4.1% carbon. This percentage decreases as pressure increases to around 50 GPa. Above that pressure the percentage of carbon at the eutectic increases. The pressure on the inner core ranges from 330 GPa to 360 GPa at the centre of the Earth. The temperature at the inner core surface is about 6000 K. The material of the inner core must be stable at the pressure and temperature found there, and more dense than that of the outer core liquid. Extrapolations show that either Fe3C or Fe7C3 match the requirements. Fe7C3 is 8.4% carbon, and Fe3C is 6.7% carbon. The inner core is growing by about 1 mm per year, or adding about 18 cubic kilometres per year. This is about 18√ó1012kg of carbon added to the inner core every year. It contains about 8√ó1021 kg of carbon. High pressure experimentation In order to determine the fate of natural carbon containing substances deep in the Earth, experiments have been conducted to see what happens when high pressure, and or temperatures are applied. Such substances include carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, graphite, methane, and other hydrocarbons such as benzene, carbon dioxide water mixtures and carbonate minerals such as calcite, magnesium carbonate, or ferrous carbonate. Under super high pressures carbon may take on a higher coordination number than the four found in sp3 compounds like diamond, or the three found in carbonates. Perhaps carbon can substitute into silicates, or form a silicon oxycarbide. Carbides may be possible. Carbon At 15 GPa graphite changes to a hard transparent form, that is not diamond. Diamond is very resistant to pressure, but at about 1 TPa (1000 GPa) transforms to a BC-8 form. Carbides Carbides are predicted to be more likely lower in the mantle as experiments have shown a much lower oxygen fugacity for high pressure iron silicates. Cohenite remains stable to over 187 GPa, but is predicted to have a denser orthorhombic Cmcm form in the inner core. Carbon dioxide Under 0.3 GPa pressure, carbon dioxide is stable at room temperature in the same form as dry ice. Over 0.5 GPa carbon dioxide forms a number of different solid forms containing molecules. At pressures over 40 GPa and high temperatures, carbon dioxide forms a covalent solid that contains CO4 tetrahedra, and has the same structure as Œ≤-cristobalite. This is called phase V or CO2-V. When CO2-V is subjected to high temperatures, or higher pressures, experiments show it breaks down to form diamond and oxygen. In the mantle the geotherm would mean that carbon dioxide would be a liquid till a pressure of 33 GPa, then it would adopt the solid CO2-V form till 43 GPa, and deeper than that would make diamond and fluid oxygen. Carbonyls High pressure carbon monoxide forms the high energy polycarbonyl covalent solid, however it is not expected to be present inside the Earth. Hydrocarbons Under 1.59 GPa pressure at 25 ¬∞C, methane converts to a cubic solid. The molecules are rotationally disordered. But over 5.25 GPa the molecules become locked into position and cannot spin. Other hydrocarbons under high pressure have hardly been studied. Carbonates Calcite changes to calcite-II and calcite-III at pressures of 1.5, and 2.2 GPa. Siderite undergoes a chemical change at 10 GPa at 1800K to form Fe4O5. Dolomite decomposes 7GPa and below 1000 ¬∞C to yield aragonite and magnesite. However, there are forms of iron containing dolomite stable at higher pressures and temperatures. Over 130 GPa aragonite undergoes a transformation to a SP3 tetrahedrally connected carbon, in a covalent network in a C2221 structure. Magnesite can survive 80 GPa, but with more than 100 GPa (as at a depth of 1800 km it changes to forms with three-member rings of CO4 tetrahedra (C3O96‚àí). If iron is present in this mineral, at these pressures it will convert to magnetite and diamond. Melted carbonates with SP3 carbon are predicted to be very viscous. Some minerals that contain both silicate and carbonate exist, spurrite and tilleyite. But high-pressure forms have not been studied. There have been attempts to make silicon carbonate. Six coordinated silicates mixed with carbonate should not exist on Earth, but may exist on more massive planets.

Electricity is employed, typically at off-peak times, to raise a mass, which is later released to generate electrical energy via a generator, typically at times of peak demand. Such devices have been considered as part of sustainability/renewable energy drives, addressing the problem of energy storage in the electricity grid. Such devices could be considered an extension of the idea behind the pendulum clock. At a small scale are designs like GravityLight, designed to power a single light bulb, especially in low income countries. At a large scale, pumped water storage (water pumped uphill to a reservoir, and then released through a hydroelectric generator) may be considered a form of gravity battery, since it uses the potential energy of the water in the uphill reservoir. Heavy trains that have run uphill can release their potential energy by using regenerative braking going downhill and act as a gravity battery that way. For grid scale storage, weights suspended by cables may generate power as they drop to the bottom of the sea, or‚Äîas with Energy Vault‚Äîfrom a crane. Relative costs of gravity storage installations that would use 2000-tonne weights suspended from winches in disused mineshafts, compared with lithium ion batteries, indicate that although the \\"up front cost is high\\" the 25-year lifespan of such equipment‚Äîwith no degradation of capacity during use‚Äîmakes a \\"compelling proposition\\" for large-scale grid balancing purposes.

It consisted of Eric Fukusaki of Peru and Munehiko Ohno from Japan. The pair released two singles in 2012: its debut \\"Akane\\" and the double A-side \\"Amatsubu Pearl\\"/\\"Dakishimetai Dakishimetai\\". Alma Kamininito released the cover album Alma Covers at the end of the year, which featured Japanese-language songs sung in Spanish and English. It marked the unit's final release following the departure of Ohno in April 2013. History 2011: Formation Part of the Japanese diaspora in Peru, Erik Fukusaki traveled to Japan at the age of 18 in order to pursue a career in enka. A Japanese native, Munehiko Ohno was a lifelong practitioner of the buy≈ç style of traditional Japanese dance. Citing music duo Chemistry, he took an interest in music at the age of 18. He began taking singing lessons while attending university. In order to gain entrance into Up-Front Works, Fukusaki and Ohno separately auditioned for the record company's Forrest Award in February 2011. Upon their admittance, Up-Front posed the idea of the pair creating a single unit together. Ohno agreed to the proposal the day of his successful audition; after seeking advisement from Alberto Shiroma of the Peruvian ensemble Diamantes and Kazufumi Miyazawa of the Japanese band The Boom, Fukusaki deliberated for two weeks before accepting. In choosing the duo's name, Fukusaki and Ohno were told to write numerous words in Spanish and Japanese onto a paper. Staff of the record company then chose and joined two Spanish words together: \\"alma\\", meaning \\"soul\\", and \\"caminito\\", meaning \\"path\\". The president of the company decided to change the spelling of the latter to \\"kami ni ito\\", meaning \\"paper\\" and \\"thread\\". Blending J-pop and Latin pop into its music, Alma Kaminiito sought to \\"unite Japan with the world\\". 2012‚Äì13: Debut and dissolution Prior to its debut, Alma Kaminiito participated in various street performances and appeared as guests at music events. The three songs recorded for Alma Kaminiito's debut single were used for the drama film Share House (2011) preceding its release. A reggae-tinged number, \\"Akane\\" was released on April 25, 2012. On that day, the duo promoted the single by performing at the Sunshine City building complex in the district of Ikebukuro. In August, the pair held its first concert entitled Alma Kaminiito 1st Live \\"Uno\\". Alma Kaminiito released the double A-side \\"Amatsubu Pearl\\"/\\"Dakishimetai Dakishimetai\\" on October 24 as its second single. In December, Alma Kaminiito released its first album Alma Covers, which contains Spanish and English- language covers of Japanese songs from the 1980s and 1990s. The translated Spanish lyrics were written by Fukusaki. The duo embarked on its first tour at the end of 2012 to February of the following year. On April 4, 2013, the departure of Ohno from the group was announced via Alma Kaminiito's official website. In his blog, he disclosed his intentions to take over his family's business.

Located at the a crossroads in the centre of the village, it is a Grade II* listed building. History The building was begun in the very late 16th century or early 17th centuries. Cadw suggests a building date as early as 1590, but the architectural writer John Newman, recording the inn in the Gwent/Monmouthshire volume of the Buildings of Wales series, favours an early 17th century date. In the mid-17th century it became the property of Henry VIII as part of Jane Seymour's wedding dowry. The inn is often said to have a priest hole, and to have been the headquarters of Oliver Cromwell during his campaigning in Monmouthshire in the English Civil War, but the main sources do not support these suggestions. In 2003 Philip Edwards, former King Alfred professor of English literature at Liverpool University suggested that T. S. Eliot made cryptic reference to this pub and the village well in his 1935 poem \\"Usk\\". The relevant lines read: ::\\"Do not suddenly break the branch, or ::Hope to find ::The white hart behind the white well.\\" Architecture and description Coflein describes the building as a double-house, although sources agree that it appears to have been a single dwelling from its earliest construction. The building is white-washed and of two storeys with a roof of Welsh slate. It is constructed to an L-plan.

He was, after positions as organist and head of the chapel in Paris and Nantes, the director and teacher at the Gregorian Institute of Paris, as a specialist of Gregorian chant.  Biography  Born in 1972 in Auray (Morbihan), Auguste Le Guennant studied at the Schola Cantorum de Paris, the organ with Alexandre Guilmant and composition with Vincent d'Indy. He held for some time the position of organist at the grand organ of Notre-Dame de Clignancourt, and left Paris in 1905 to become head of the chapel at Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Port in Les Sables-d'Olonne, and from 1908 at the Basilica of Saint-Nicolas in Nantes. He founded the mixed group A Capella in this city, in collaboration with A. Mahot. The Mutual Edition of the Schola Cantorum published his Adagietto for organ, and an O Salutaris for four mixed voices. Mr. Biton published an accompanying book on Gregorian chant. In 1925, Le Guennant arrived at the Gregorian Institute of Paris as director and teacher of Gregorian chant, succeeding Dom Joseph Gajard of the Solesmes Abbey. After the Second World War, he organized many Gregorian sessions, not only in France but also in F√°tima, and even Rio de Janeiro. Still teaching at the Gregorian Institute in Paris, this pedagogue and musician considerably boosted the teaching of Gregorian chant, by creating centres of study in several countries. When Maurice Durufl√© thought about basing his Requiem on Gregorian chant, he asked Le Guennant for advice, and gratefully acknowledged his understanding. In 1960, Durufl√© dedicated a composition to Le Guennant, his Quatre Motets sur des th√®mes gr√©goriens which were also based on chant. In 1953, Le Guennant was awarded the Honorary Doctorate of the Pontifical Institute of Sacred Music in Rome.

Crown-topped shield with a monogram in the form of the letter 'K'. The Kelch Gothic Revival silver service, created in 1900, was one of the finest silver services made by Peter Carl Faberg√©. The silverware was commissioned by Alexander and Barbara Kelch (Russian:–ö–µ–ª—å—Ö, Kelkh). Peter Carl Faberg√© considered it the most important silver masterpiece made in his workshop; it was also the most expensive. Faberg√© silver service commissioned by Alexander & Barbara Kelch. 2017-08-20 Kelch‚Äôs silverware is assumed to have been melted down circa 1918, following the October Revolution. For the next 100 years experts of Faberg√© had claimed that the tableware was completely destroyed.G. Habsburg, ‚ÄûFaberg√©. Treasure of Imperial Russia\\", Petersburg 2004, s. 294 i 318. In 2017, it appeared that items from the service had survived, having been discovered in Poland.  History  The idea for designing the service in the neo-Gothic style was conceived in 1898 along with the rebuilding of the Kelch mansion in Saint Petersburg. The service was intended to complement Barbara Kelch‚Äôs Gothic scheme for the new dining room. The tableware was designed in 1900 by the distinguished Russian architect Fedor Shekhtel who cooperated with Faberg√©. The tableware was made in 1900 in a Moscow branch of Faberg√©'s company. Alexander Kelch paid the astounding sum of 125,000 rubles for the tableware. The price Alexander Kelch paid for the tableware makes it the most expensive Faberg√© work that was ever made. Parts of the Kelch‚Äôs tableware were presented on the charity exhibition of Faberg√© works organized in 1902 in Saint Petersburg in Baron Paul von Dervies' mansion. This was the one and only exhibition of Faberg√© works organized in the period of his activity. The exhibition presented Faberg√© works belonging to Empresses Maria Feodorovna and Alexandra Feodorovna and family members of the House of Romanov and representatives of the aristocracy.A. Szyma≈Ñski, ‚ÄûFaberg√©. Historia i arcydzie≈Ça\\", Opole 2014, s. 73-74. The Kelch‚Äôs silver service was the only work shown at this exhibition which didn't belong to the aristocrats, but to the family of rich industrialists. Until 1905 Kelch‚Äôs silver tableware was in the Kelch mansion in Saint Petersburg. In that year, as a result of Alexander and Barbara separation, the tableware was transported to the Bazanov‚Äôs palace in Moscow. After the October Revolution in 1918 the Kelch‚Äôs silver service was confiscated and melted down. For 100 years, until 2017 it was considered as completely destroyed, as no parts of the service were in any Faberg√© collection. In January 2017 some pieces of cutlery appearing to come from the neo-Gothic Kelch service surfaced in the art market in Poland.  Description  The Aleksander and Barbara Kelch's representative tableware was made in the neo-Gothic style. The style of silver service referred to the style and the d√©cor of the dining room in Kelch mansion in Saint Petersburg. The decoration and ornaments used by Faberg√© are coming from the English and German Gothic style. Motifs of the tableware are stylized Gothic architecture, plant ornaments, dragons, griffins, lizards, snakes and other Gothic creatures, heraldic lilly, crown-topped shield with a monogram in the form of the letter 'K'. The tableware consisted of many dishes and objects, including: a surtout de table, two seven-lamp candlesticks, two high tureens, soup tureens with lids, platters, bowls, plates, sauce boats, trays, cabarets, cutlery, salt cellars and others.T. Faberg√©, ‚ÄûFaberg√©. A comprehensive reference book\\", Genewa 2012, s. 466-471. The medieval dragons were the main motif decorating the tableware, therefore the Kelch‚Äôs tableware sometimes is being called the \\"Faberg√© dragon tableware\\". Crown-topped shield with a monogram in the form of the letter 'K' is also an important motif decorating the objects belonging to the Kelch‚Äôs tableware. The pieces were marked with the Faberg√© hallmark and the court jeweler hallmark.

His unbeaten 172 in the second innings of the 1904 University Match was the highest score in the fixture at the time. He was born at Thame, Oxfordshire and died at Higham on the Hill, Leicestershire. Marsh was educated at Amersham Hall school and at Jesus College, Cambridge. As a cricketer he was a right-handed opening batsman and he had made his debut for Oxfordshire County Cricket Club in minor matches in 1892, playing regularly in the county's Minor Counties matches from 1897. He was described in his obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack as \\"a batsman with a dogged defence and no pretensions to style\\". He was 25 years old before he went to Cambridge University and played in the freshmen's trial match in 1901, scoring 98 in the second innings, but then failed to be selected for any games except trial matches at Cambridge for the next three seasons. In 1904, however, having made a century in a trial match for the university side, Marsh finally made his first-class debut and in his third game, the match against the London County Cricket Club, W. G. Grace's team, he scored 118 in the second innings. That led to his selection for the 1904 University Match against Oxford University, where he proved to be a successful but controversial player. In the second Cambridge innings, Marsh made an unbeaten 172, the highest score in the history of the University Match, beating by one run the 171 made by Tip Foster in 1900. The decision by Cambridge captain Frederic Wilson to delay the second innings declaration to enable Marsh to beat the record was widely criticised as the match then ended in a draw. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack wrote that the delay \\"was clearly a mistake\\" and that \\"the chance of winning the match should have outweighed all considerations of personal distinction\\", though it added that rain and missed catches had also contributed to Cambridge's failure to win. Marsh played no further first-class cricket after leaving Cambridge University in the summer of 1904, and his appearances for Oxfordshire tailed off by 1906. He became a schoolmaster at Rossall School ‚Äì where he was joined fleetingly by his Cambridge cricket captain, Wilson, who soon left to become a sports journalist; Marsh remained at Rossall until 1915.

During the second half of the tenth century the Byzantine Empire was characterized by emperors either devoted to or forced into long periods of campaigning mostly in the Middle East, Crete, Cyprus, Antioch; many other territories were also conquered during this period.Romane (2015), pp. 34, 35Romane (2015), pp. 6Kennedy (2004), pp. 278‚Äì279Treadgold (1997), pp. 500‚Äì501 The success Byzantium experienced during this period was largely thanks to the Phokas clan, an aristocratic family who consistently produced competent generals, and their relatives. Indeed, during the reigns of Nikephoros II Phokas and his nephew John I Tzimiskes, these aristocratic generals supplanted the legitimate heirs of the Macedonian dynasty, the adolescent brothers Basil II and Constantine VIII, as the true rulers of the empire. When Tzimiskes died in 976 Basil II ascended to power. Quickly, however, tensions began to flare up within the royal court itself as the purple-born emperor attempted to reign fully out of the influence of the established court eunuchs. The figureheads behind the simmering tensions in the capital would come to blows in a major rebellion lead by Bardas Phokas the Younger, the most powerful man left of the old Phokas regime.  Prelude to the rebellion  The war was sparked by tensions circulating between the newly crowned emperor Basil II and the Phokades-Lekapenos clan. In 985, Basil dismissed the longtime chief minister, the eunuch Basil Lekapenos.Kaldellis (2017), p. 94 He first placed him under house arrest in Constantinople and then later exiled him and confiscated his possessions. Following this, Basil attempted to weaken the overall power of the Phokades-Lekapenos clan and their supporters across the empire. Throughout 985 he demoted or dismissed suspected sympathizers. Bardas Phokas the Younger was demoted from Domestic of the Schools of the East to mere doux of the East, with nominal authority over Antioch, while the former doux of Antioch, a supporter of Lekapenos, Leo Melissenos, was recalled to the capital.Kaldellis (2017), p. 94 Basil also recalled the katepano of Italy, Delphinas, as he too was a supporter of Lekapenos.Kaldellis (2017), p. 94 It was around this time that Bulgarian forces once again began to raid into Byzantine Greece. Basil, however, saw this as an opportunity: by crushing the Bulgarian forces, he could legitimize his reign at home while diminishing the distinguished military record of the Phokades carried on by Bardas Phokas in the east, as this was his main catalyst of support, he himself being a poor strategist. He departed for the western front in 986 and reached Serdica by summer. He besieged the city for twenty days before becoming worried on account of circulating rumors that Melissenos was planning a coup in the capital. On August 16, however, he was ambushed by the Bulgarian tsar Samuel's forces at the Gates of Trajan. His forces were scattered, and Basil was disgraced by the defeat.Zlatarski, History of the Bulgarian state, v. I, ch. 2, pp. 674‚Äì675 Not only was Samuil able to reconquer much of the former Bulgarian Empire,Bozhilov, Iv., The anonimous of Haza.

Worse yet, news of the disastrous defeat would reach as far as Baghdad, where the former rebel Bardas Skleros had been granted asylum by the ruling Buyid dynasty.  Beginning of hostilities  In a formal treaty in December 986, Skleros agreed to a number of concessions to the Buyids, including an exchange of Muslim prisoners, and cession of certain border fortresses, provided that they would provide him with support in an open rebellion against the Byzantine Empire. The Buyids, however, did not assist Skleros with a standing army; instead he recruited Arab tribesmen and Armenians on his way to the Byzantine border. In February 987, he reached Melitene, which surrendered to him, where he would declare himself emperor. The Emir of the Buyids, however, Samsam al-Dawla, who had supported Skleros, was overthrown the same year, and while formal support from Baghdad continued, in reality the possibility of actual Buyid intervention in the war all but vanished. At Melitene, Skleros was able to confiscate large quantities of gold and provisions, as well as corral local support, including from the Kurdish chieftain Bad ibn Dustuk. Meanwhile, Basil attempted to counter the invasion of Skleros by elevating Bardas Phokas back to Domestic of the East. Phokas, however, who was already in control of most of Byzantine Asia Minor, in turn rebelled against Basil.Kaldellis (2017), pp. 97 Phokas then appealed to Skleros to join his cause, as Phokas, despite being the inferior tactician, commanded a much stronger force. The two came upon an agreement that if they were victorious, they would partition the empire, with Skleros taking Antioch and the eastern provinces and Phokas taking the rest. Skleros took to the plan, however, upon meeting in Cappadocia, Phokas promptly had him imprisoned and took over the rebellion for himself.Kaldellis (2017), p. 97 Following this Skleros' Arab contingents returned home; Phokas now controlled all of Byzantine Asia Minor. Phokas quickly moved his armies towards the Bosphorus Strait in an attempt to blockade Constantinople and eventually cross into Europe and besiege the capital itself. While Phokas encamped on the Asian side of the Bosphorus, Delphinas, Phokas' ally and the former katepano of Italy, and Phokas' blinded brother Nikephoros, encamped at Chrysopolis. Phokas attempted to take Abydos without success, leaving Melissenos in charge of the siege, while Delphinas attempted to block grain imports into Constantinople, also without success, as the loyalists were able to use their command of the Black Sea to bring in food from some loyalist coastal cities, such as Trebizond.Kaldellis (2017), p. 97  Basil turns the tide  At this time, Basil II made a foreign policy decision which would change the course of eastern European history forever. In exchange for Rus' assistance in his civil war, and a guarantee to Christianize Russia, Basil agreed to marry off his sister, Anna, to the grand prince of Rus', Vladimir the Great. Early in 988, Vladimir's forces arrived in Byzantium with his own troops along with a contingent of 6,000 Varangians.The Earliest Mediaeval Churches of Kiev, Samuel H. Cross, H. V. Morgilevski and K. J. Conant, Speculum, Vol. 11, No. 4 (Oct., 1936), 479.Kaldellis (2017), p. 98 The same year Basil crossed the Bosporus and took Delphinas' camp by surprise, defeating his troops and taking him into custody. He was swiftly executed, while Nikephorus was arrested, as Basil's forces continued to move onward. As this offensive continued, the Georgian loyalist Gregory Taronites landed in Trebizond. He soon began to ravage Phokas' rear with impunity, moving towards the Euphrates. Phokas sent his son, also named Nikephoros, to the kouropalates of Tao, David III, in order to procure new troops for the rebellion. He managed marshaled 2,000 Caucasian troops. Taronites was defeated by Nikephoros, but his armies soon disbanded and returned to their respective homelands as they heard of the defeat at Chrysopolis. In early 989, Phokas became more and more desperate, and intensified the Siege of Abydos. Basil, however, was speedily approaching his camp, and Phokas had no choice but to make preparations for battle. He died, suddenly, possibly of a seizure, on April 16, before the battle could begin. The rebellion quickly disintegrated without his leadership. On November 3, Leo Phokas, under pressure from his people, surrendered Antioch. Many of Phokas' former followers wished to continue the fight under Skleros, and so they released him from captivity, but he was by now in his late 60's, and was tired of the fight. By October, he negotiated a surrender with Basil, guaranteeing his amnesty. He retired to Didymoteichon, where he died on March 6, 991.  Aftermath  Despite the inherently destructive nature of most rebellions, Bardas Phokas' rebellion, in fact, provided the Byzantine Empire with many long-term benefits. The most glaring of these was that the resources-depleted David III was now in no position to withstand a concentrated Byzantine attack on his Iberian territories, and his countries were quickly overrun in the years after the civil war in retaliation for his support of Phokas.Kaldellis (2017), pp. 101 The Rus' emerged from the civil war the newest Christian state in Europe, and one the largest, largely as a result of the diplomacy sparked by the rebellion.Kaldellis (2017), pp. 97 The civil war also highlighted the inability of the Buyids to effectively influence Byzantine politics in a meaningful way despite their supposed military might and control of the Caliph.Kaldellis (2017), pp. 102  References   Sources    Stoimenov, D., Temporary Byzantine military administration in the Bulgarian lands 971-987/989 (Vremenna vizantiyska voenna administratsiya v balgarskite zemi 971-987/989, –í—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–∞ –≤–∏–∑–∞–Ω—Ç–∏–π—Å–∫–∞ –≤–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–∞ –∞–¥–º–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ü–∏—è –≤ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏—Ç–µ –∑–µ–º–∏ 971-987/989), in Yearbook of the Sofia University Magazine.

Early life Yury Yurkun, selfportrait Yurkun was born in Lithuania on September 17, 1895, from a Catholic family. The original name is Juozas, written as Iosif (–ò–æ—Å–∏—Ñ) in Russian. Personal life Yuri Yurkun was the lover of poet Mikhail Kuzmin, who dedicated to him the cycle, \\"On the Journey\\" (\\"V doroge\\", dated February‚ÄìAugust 1913). They met in Kiev in February 1913. Kuzmin wrote in his diary, on March 3, 1913: \\"I just cannot get my writing going; the closest possible friendship with Nagrodskaya, my love for Yurkun, my departure from the Sudeikins - that is all that has happened.\\" Yurkun's profession in Kiev is unknown. He was possibly an actor working under the pseudonym \\"Mogandri.\\" Others state he was a clerk in a bookstore. He went back to St. Petersburg with Kuzmin and they remained together until Kuzmin's death in 1936. While with Kuzmin, Yurkun also had a relationship with Nadezhda Zborovskaya-Auslender, an actress and wife of Kuzmin's nephew. The relationship with Kuzmin was not easy as the poet writes: \\"I love him very much, but his obstinacy and hooliganism will destroy him, no doubt about it\\" (Diary, May 27, 1913). In 1917 Yurkun was conscripted by the Bolsheviks, but deserted soon after. Yurkun and Kuzmin lived in St. Petersburg from 1918 to 1921. In 1918 Yurkun was arrested and detained for a brief period. In December 1920, Yurkun met his future wife, Olga Gildebrandt Arbenina, a young actress using the stage name of her father, Arbenin. The marriage legally never happened, but they considered themselves married. Yurkun, Arbenina and Kuzmin continued to live together with Yurkun's mother in the same communal apartment. In 1931 the secret police searched their apartment and confiscated Yurkun's manuscripts, forcing him to sign an agreement to cooperate.

More recent work has established it as a member of the Jarrkan group. Gajirrabeng is at severe risk of extinction, with no more than perhaps 2 or 3 native speakers by 2013. Frances Kofod compiled a dictionary of the language in 2007. Country Gadjerong lands encompassed in Norman Tindale's reckoning. They ran westwards along the rich ecosystems of mangrove flat, waterholes, creeks and waterfalls along the coastal area from the mouth of the Fitzmaurice River as far as point where the Keep River flows out into the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf. Their inland extension, taking in also at Legune, went as far as the vicinity of Border Springs. They also frequented the offshore area of Quoin Island, and further north, Clump Island, and those off the mouth of Keyling Inlet. History The implementation of the Ord River Irrigation scheme had a major impact on the Gadjerong and other tribes of the east Kimberley area. They were dispossessed of parts of their traditional tribal land and many sacred sites were destroyed. In consequence they moved to the Aboriginal reserve in Kununurra. The extension of the principle of equal pay for equal work in 1969 to Aborigines likewise had a negative impact on peoples like the Gadjerong in the Kimberley region and the Northern Territory since the managers of pastoral leases evicted the majority of indigenous peoples on the land where they lived, with the collateral loss of employment and its substitution by welfare subsidies.

The character was introduced as the older sister to the three original Powerpuff Girls, having been absent during all their lives because of running away when she lost control of her powers. She is portrayed as a teenager, being much taller and having wider hips than the other Powerpuff Girls, in difference form the other three she also has darker skin. The character has been widely interpreted as being black and to a lesser degree Hispanic. She is marketed as the fourth Powerpuff Girl and was met with mixed reactions from fans and critics. Creation Characterization Design Bliss is taller and has a more developed body than the three younger Powerpuff Girls, with brown skin that is shades darker than would be described as a common tan, purple eyes, and cyan hair. Her dress is purple to match her eyes, much like her three sisters with their own signature color. In difference to the other girls, her leggings do not reach all the way down to her feet, courtesy of her being wider and taller. She also has a dark blue plastic headband (a so-called \\"alice band\\") that none of the others wear, featuring a fuchsia pink heart. Voice actors The character had a total of five English voice actors for different regions and fifteen overall for the film's original airing. In the American version, Olivia Olson, who is widely known as the voice of Marceline the Vampire Queen in Adventure Time, voiced the character. South African musician Toya Delazy who is one of the many actors voicing the character in different countries expressed that she was intrigued by the character and felt a connection to her due to their similar backgrounds, as Delazy explained that she too missed out on getting to know her three sisters due to being estranged from her father for many years. Alesha Dixon who voiced Bliss for the British version expressed that she was beyond excited about her role and loved voicing character but that it was a hard job, explaining that this was due to the characters feisty personality and the fact that she had to do a lot of screaming while voicing her. She also stated that she watched the episode with her daughter Azura when it aired and that her daughter recognized her as the character. In the Arabic version the Fourth Powerpuff Girl is voiced by Nancy Ajram, a prominent Lebanese singer.https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/television/nancy-ajram-joins- forces-with-the-powerpuff-girls-1.674022 In the French version, she is voiced by comedian Claudia Tagbo. Appearances The first teaser image was released in September 2017, the image has shown Bliss from the back and in silhouette, but with her purple coloring visible. The character was first shown fully at the MCM London Comic Con on Friday, October 27, 2017. She debuted on the series in the first part of the five-part television movie The Power of Four, each part of the movie was named explicitly with a pun on the characters name, the first one being \\"Find Your Bliss\\", followed by \\"Bliss Reminisce\\", \\"Blisster Sister\\", \\"Breaking Bliss\\" and \\"Blisstersweet Symphony\\". All parts were aired on television as episodes of the series. The character returned in the episode \\"Never Been Blissed\\" in 2018 during the series' twentieth anniversary,https://www.regularcapital.com/2018/05/toya-delazy- returns-to-voice-bliss-in-the-powerpuff-girls-special-never-been-blissed-for- cartoon-network-africa/ https://archive.today/20180607123933/https://www.regularcapital.com/2018/05/toya- delazy-returns-to-voice-bliss-in-the-powerpuff-girls-special-never-been- blissed-for-cartoon-network-africa/ and in the episode \\"Lights Out!\\". Outside of animation she has been featured in merchandise such as headphones, cupcake toppers and several t-shirts. Powers and abilities As a response to a rival's creation of the perfect little boy, Professor Utonium created Bliss out of sugar, spice, and everything nice; however, he accidentally using Chemical W (as opposed to the other Powerpuff Girls who were created with Chemical X) gave Bliss unique psionic powers (telekinesis, short-range teleportation, and energy) that neither her sisters nor their original counterparts possess. Her unique abilities are difficult for her to control and she sometimes loses control of them when she feels any form of emotion. Reception The character's initial announcement was met with negative reactions from some fans who expressed that the new characters marketing as \\"The fourth Powerpuff Girl\\" was inaccurate and ignored the previously introduced character of Bunny from the 1998 series, but when rumors began to spread that the character would be black, many fans began to express a more optimistic tone. The rumors began to emerge when it was announced that South African singer Toya Delazy would be providing the voice for the character. Louise Mccreesh of Digital Spy expressed that she believed that the character was a great step forward in terms of racial diversity. Gabriela Herstik of HelloGiggles stated that she saw that most fans were both equally excited and nervous at the announcement of the character, she also wrote that she personally felt that the character was a good addition. Charles Pulliam-Moore of io9 stated that the character is different from the other temporary additions to the Powerpuff trio such as Princess Morbucks, Bunny, and Bullet the Squirrel, all who existed to teach the original girls moral lessons before they left the group to pursue their own destinies. While Bliss does not appear to him in that way, he expressed that he felt that the story of The Power of Four made him question whether the new reboot was a good idea in the first place. Moore stated that he felt that while he watched the movie that Bliss was meant to be a person of color, he stated: \\"The more you see Bliss go through the process of losing control of herself and then becoming a physical threat, the more glaringly apparent it becomes that, unlike her sisters, Bliss is coded as a person of color. Everything about Bliss is designed to set her apart from the three original Powerpuff Girls. One imagines it‚Äôs to signal that she‚Äôs a new kind of Powerpuff meant to be more reflective of the show‚Äôs diverse audience. She‚Äôs taller, has skin a shade of brown that‚Äôs deeper than a tan, purple eyes, and electric blue hair. Bliss reads as distinctly non-white and decidedly multi-ethnic.\\" In Moore's opinion so was the creation of Bliss a means for the creators of the show to wink at the non-white audience that has watched the show for years and express their recognition of them as watchers. Despite this, he felt that he was disappointed in the fact that the first non- white Powerpuff girl had been introduced as an emotionally unstable time-bomb who isn't capable of putting her feelings together properly to act as a regular superhero like the others. He stated that the portrayal of black and Latina women as hot-headed is a stereotype he is all too used to seeing in media. He finished his article with; \\"In a lot of ways, Bliss feels like a collection of well-intentioned afterthoughts that would have worked better earlier on in the series.\\" Toya Delazy acknowledged the criticism of the character, and stated that she believed the negative reception had not been as major as the positive she had received, as well as that she did not think of the character as meaning to imply or enforce any harmful ideas about black women and that her own feelings on it simply was that it was a cartoon that didn't need to necessarily be analyzed to that depth. Kayla Sutton, a social media curator and the major contributor for the digital publication Black Girl Nerds, cried when the character was unveiled. Via email to The Daily Dot she said: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt get many black cartoon characters and when we do, we‚Äôre just the comic relief‚Äù. Danielle Ransom, herself of The Daily Dot stated that she originally experienced excitement at the introduction of a Powerpuff girl with remarkably darker skin than the others, but when she viewed the film she thought that the creators should have taken time to make a character that was more than what she felt was a caricature of an angry black girl, something which she reported had non-plussed many other fans. Paula Poindexter who teaches media representation of African Americans at the University of Texas, who saw it as a positive that there is a person of color in the series, did express some concern about Bliss's characterization as an emotional teenager who can't control herself to The Daily Dot as well. Poindexter stated that everything positive about the character got turned into a negative in the film and said that the character is little more than a token. Ransom concluded that Bliss seemed more like an attempt by the creators to hop on the diversity trend as opposed to a part of the black empowerment movement.

The foundation funds early childhood education programs in Oakland, various arts programs around the San Francisco Bay Area, and research into inflammatory bowel disease. History The Kenneth Rainin Foundation was founded in 2007 by Kenneth Rainin, founder of Rainin Instrument Company, which sold a mainstream brand of laboratory pipettes. Rainin donated a substantial part of his fortune to a variety of causes during his lifetime. He supported the San Francisco Ballet, where he served as Chairman of the Executive Committee. Rainin also supported research at University of California, San Francisco and Cleveland Clinic Foundation into the causes of Crohn‚Äôs disease and colitis and other intestinal disorders. He founded the Kenneth Rainin Foundation in support of his philanthropic interests and after his death in 2007, the foundation became the main beneficiary of his estate. The foundation is a family run organization. Jennifer Rainin, Kenneth Rainin‚Äôs daughter, has served as CEO since its public launch in 2009.  Grants  Arts The foundation provides support for small and mid-sized performing and multidisciplinary arts organizations in the Bay Area. In the past groups and organizations such the American Conservatory Theater, Magic Theatre, and Shotgun Players have received grants from the Foundation. With funds from the Rainin Foundation, SFFILM (formerly known as San Francisco Film Society) administers a grants program to support narrative feature films that explore contemporary social issues. In addition to financial assistance, recipients receive various benefits through SFFILMs filmmaker services programs. Since 2009, more than $3.5 million has been awarded, recipients include Ryan Coogler‚Äôs Fruitvale Station and Benh Zeitlin‚Äôs Beasts of the Southern Wild‚Äô‚Äô. In 2013, the Rainin Foundation collaborated with Northern California Community Loan Fund (NCCLF) to create the Community Arts Stabilization Trust (a nonprofit real estate holding company that purchases property in the Bay Area and provides leases for the exclusive use of arts organizations.) The Rainin Foundation awarded $5 million in seed funding to launch the organization. Community Arts Stabilization Trust successes to date include purchasing and renovating spaces for two San Francisco arts organizations, the Luggage Store Gallery, a multidisciplinary art gallery, and CounterPulse, an interdisciplinary dance company. The foundation launched its Open Spaces Program in 2016 to support temporary, site specific public art projects in Oakland and San Francisco. In December 2016, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf announced that the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and Rainin Foundation would provide funds for a financial and technical assistance program to help arts organizations facing displacement in Oakland. In May 2020, a coalition of private donors, foundations, and the City of Oakland launched a relief fund with $625,000 for artists and culture workers living in Alameda and Contra Costa Counties. The Kenneth Rainin Foundation made the announcement, noting that at least $300,000 of the fund would be dedicated specifically to residents of Oakland. Education The aim of the Rainin Foundation‚Äôs education program is to improve literacy and reading for young children and students in the Oakland Unified School District up to third grade. The foundation implements SEEDS of Learning in the Oakland Unified School District. Originally developed at the University of Minnesota, SEEDS of Learning is a professional development program through which the foundation supplies resources and strategies to educators, parents, and caregivers to build social, emotional, language and literacy tools for young children to prepare them for success in kindergarten. The program served approximately 1,300 students in the 2016-2017 school year. In 2014, the program piloted ‚ÄòTalk Read Sing‚Äô, a public awareness campaign to distribute materials to encourage parents and caregivers to talk, read, and sing to infants and toddlers to promote early literacy development. The foundation partnered with Bay Area Council Children's Hospital Oakland, Goodby, Silverstein & Partners and others on the project. The foundation also partnered with NORC at the University of Chicago to conduct a survey of over 400 low-income families in Oakland, including understanding parenting behaviors and reading habits. Health The Foundation's health program supports projects aimed at diagnosing, treating, and ultimately curing IBD; the program is open to researchers at all levels and from any scientific discipline. The health program also provides longer-term support for previous grantees and hosts an annual symposium aimed at accelerating innovations to improve treatments for IBD. Recipients of grants include research institutions, such as Washington University in St. Louis, Weill Cornell Medicine, Pennsylvania State University, Princeton University, Stanford University School of Medicine, and University of Texas at Austin. In 2017, the Kenneth Rainin Foundation launched an online resource to inspire collaboration in IBD research. The website features the work of dedicated investigators and highlights projects and ideas, with the goal of opening opportunities for researchers and clinicians to connect and nurture discoveries. In April 2018, the Helmsley Trust and the Kenneth Rainin Foundation co-hosted a workshop for researchers and stakeholders to discuss the role of diet, nutrition, and the microbiome in preventing and treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Key findings from the workshop with an emphasis on gaps in knowledge, potential answers to address these gaps, and priorities for future research were included a summary report, Evolving Research: Diet, the Microbiome, and Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

Such temporary structures are purpose-built for the ceremony in the royal field of Sanam Luang. Thai royal funerals are elaborate events, organised as royal ceremonies akin to state funerals. They are held for deceased members of the Royal Family, and consist of numerous rituals which typically span several months to over a year. Featuring a mixture of Buddhist and animist beliefs, as well as Hindu symbolism, these rituals include the initial rites that take place after death, a lengthy period of lying-in-state, during which Buddhist ceremonies take place, and a final cremation ceremony. For the highest-ranking royalty, the cremation ceremonies are grand public spectacles, featuring the pageantry of large funeral processions and ornate purpose-built funeral pyres or temporary crematoria known as ' or '. The practices date to at least the 17th century, during the time of the Ayutthaya Kingdom. Today, the cremation ceremonies are held in the royal field of Sanam Luang in the historic centre of Bangkok. Overview A mural in Wat Phra Kaew depicting the funeral procession, represented in Thai style, of Intharachit (Indrajit) from the epic Ramakien The main components of a royal funeral do not differ much from regular Thai funerals, which are based on Buddhist beliefs mixed with local animist traditions. Hindu symbolism, a long-standing feature of the monarchy, is also featured prominently. A bathing ceremony is held shortly after death, followed by the rituals of dressing the body and placing it within the ', a funerary urn used in place of a coffin. The kot is then placed on display and daily Buddhist rites‚Äîwhich include chants by Buddhist monks and the playing of ceremonial music every three hours‚Äîare held for an extended period, which today has come to signify lying-in-state in the Western sense. While these rituals were traditionally private affairs, the royal cremation ceremony has long been a public spectacle; those held for the highest-ranking royalty feature temporary crematoria known as ', which are purpose-built in the royal field next to the palace. The body is brought to the cremation field in an elaborate procession featuring great funeral carriages, and days of theatrical performances are held. There are many levels of royal funerals, depending on the rank and status of the deceased royal family member. Such distinctions are reflected in details such as the type of kot used, and the type and location of the crematorium‚Äîmerumat are only built for the monarch and highest-ranking royals; the cremation of lower-ranking royals employ simpler structures known as ', the simpler variants of which were tents of white cloth, or may be held in the permanent crematoria of temples (similarly to most commoners today) instead of purpose-built ones in the royal field. The supreme patriarch and high-ranking Buddhist monks may also receive royal cremations similar to those of lesser royals. While documentation of historic private rites are scarce, as they were passed on by oral tradition, royal cremation ceremonies have been documented since the Ayutthaya period, and have continued into the current Rattanakosin Kingdom. They were previously very elaborate and grand, but have been much simplified since the funeral of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) in 1911. Following the abolishment of absolute monarchy in 1932, King Prajadhipok (Rama VII) abdicated and died in England, and royal funerals became a rare occurrence, apart from that of King Ananda Mahidol (Rama VIII) in 1950 and Queen Sri Savarindira in 1956. The ceremony received somewhat of a revival in the funeral of Queen Rambai Barni (Prajadhipok's widow) in 1985. Royal cremations held since include those of Princess Mother Srinagarindra in 1996, Princess Galyani Vadhana in 2008, Princess Bejaratana in 2012, and King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX) in 2017. Initial rituals and lying-in-state Bathing ceremony and sukam sop The bathing ceremony takes place shortly after death. Today, it is held in the Phiman Rattaya Throne Hall in the Grand Palace, and is attended by members of the Royal Family and senior government officials. As with common funerals today, this takes place as a ceremonial pouring of water by the attendees, but the water is usually poured over the deceased's feet instead of the hand, as is done for commoners. After the bathing ceremony, the hair is ritually combed, once upwards and once downwards, and the comb is broken. For high-ranking royals, a gold death mask is placed on the body (after sealing the orifices with wax, in times before embalming). Next is the ' ritual, i.e. the tying, wrapping and placing of the body in the kot. This is performed by officials of the ', an ancient court office responsible for, among other things, maintaining the king's wardrobe and attending to the bodies of royals after death. The body is first dressed in white, with the appropriate accessories. It is then ritually tied with undyed string, and wrapped in a white shroud. The body is finally placed in a foetal position in the kot. A chada (pointed crown) is ritually placed on the head of the body, before the lid of the kot is finally closed. Kot The funerary urn or ' of King Chulalongkorn atop the five-tiered pedestal in 1911. High-ranking members of the Royal Family usually lie in state for a hundred days within the Dusit Maha Prasat Throne Hall. The kot (from Sanskrit ko≈õa, meaning \\"container\\") is a large funerary urn, used to contain the body of the deceased in place of a coffin. It is used for royalty, as well as high-ranking members of the nobility. Today it may also be granted to high-ranking government officials. It consists of two layers: an outer shell, usually ornately decorated, with two opening halves and a pointed lid; and an inner cylindrical container known as '. There are fourteen types of kot, which are granted to the deceased according to their rank and status. The highest- ranking kot, , is reserved for the king and the highest-ranking royal family members. For high-ranking royalty today, the kot is enshrined on a decorated pedestal known as ' in the Dusit Maha Prasat Throne Hall of the Grand Palace. A long strip of cloth known as ', tied to the shroud within the kot and passing under the lid, is laid down to symbolically connect to the deceased during the ' ritual. A tube runs down from an opening at the base of the kot, connecting it to a jar (') hidden beneath the pedestal which serves to collect fluids, as the body was mostly allowed to decompose within the kot in the days before embalming. This often led to undesirable odours, which had to be masked by burning fragrant incenses. The kot probably derived from the use of burial urns in ancient Southeast Asian traditions, which also featured secondary burials, comparable to the custom of waiting a certain period before cremation. Despite the Sanskrit origin of the term, such urns were not used by Medieval cultures of the Indian Subcontinent, from which the practice of cremation spread to Thailand, along with Buddhism. During the funeral of Princess Mother Srinagarindra in 1995, the royal body was not physically placed in the kot, in accordance with her wishes. Instead, a coffin was used, placed behind the pedestal which still customarily bore the empty kot. The same was done for the funerals of Princess Galyani Vadhana and King Bhumibol, although Princess Bejaratana opted for her body to be placed in the kot according to tradition. Daily rites Members of the public queuing to pay their last respects to King Bhumibol Adulyadej in 2017 The kot, containing the body, is enshrined in the throne hall for a period of time (usually at least 100 days). In modern times, this has become analogous to lying-in-state, although the practice predates Western contact and did not originally serve to allow the public to pay their respects. During this time, daily Buddhist rites are held, with chanting by monks around-the-clock, and ceremonial music known as ' is played by the prakhom band every three hours, alongside a piphat nang hong group. Further Buddhist ceremonies are held to mark the 7th, 15th, 50th and 100th days since the death. During these Buddhist rites, meal offerings (for morning and midday ceremonies) and offerings of cloth on behalf of the dead, known as sadappakon, are made to the monks. While these rites were also historically private affairs, members of the public have been allowed to pay their respects in the Dusit Maha Prasat Throne Hall since the funeral of King Chulalongkorn. Mourning Historically, the kingdom's subjects had to shave their heads and dress in white to mourn the death of the king. This practice has also been abandoned since the funeral of King Chulalongkorn. The practice of wearing black for mourning was also a Western import introduced around the King's time. Today, mourning mostly follows Western protocols. The government announces a mourning period to be observed by government officials, and national flags are flown at half-mast. Public entertainment activities is requested to be withheld for a certain period, and broadcast media also typically suspends entertainment programming as well. Mourning is again observed during the cremation period. Preparation for cremation Merumat and men Cremation pyre of King Mongkut (Rama IV), c. 1869‚Äì70. Mongkut was the last king to be cremated in such large merumat, which were typically high. As the royal funerary services take place, preparations are made and a temporary royal crematorium‚Äîa merumat or men (rendered as phra merumat and phra men in the royal register‚Äîsee explanation under below), depending on the rank of the deceased‚Äîis erected in the royal field next to the palace. This is Sanam Luang in today's Rattanakosin period; its role as the site of royal cremations explains its former name, Thung Phra Men, which means \\"royal cremation field\\". The construction of merumat for royal cremations date to the Ayutthaya period, as Hindu beliefs were absorbed from the Khmer Empire. Following the Hindu-Buddhist ideology of divine kingship, the king was believed to be semi-divine, and the merumat symbolizes Mount Meru, the centre of the universe atop which lies the home of the gods, to which the king would return after death. The earliest merumat was probably erected during the reign of King Prasat Thong (1629‚Äì1656), and modelled after Angkor Wat. Ayutthaya- period merumat were gigantic structures. The one built for King Narai (died 1688) was recorded as being 3 sen (60 fathoms) tall‚Äî120 metres according to modern conversion rates. Despite the usual translation of merumat as \\"funeral pyre\\", it was actually a mainly decorative structure, within which the much smaller actual pyre was housed. Merumat were always temporary structures purpose-built for the ceremony, and featured the exquisite craftsmanship of the kingdom's best artisans. The merumat of Chulalongkorn (1911) and later kings were built in the style of a butsabok. The construction of the merumat often took months, if not years, to complete. This, along with the fact that the cremation had to take place in the dry season, partly contributed to the practice of waiting lengthy periods before cremation. Often, by the time a merumat or men was completed, it would be used for multiple cremations, as multiple royal deaths had occurred. The practice of building very large merumat was last seen in the funeral of King Mongkut (Rama IV, died 1868). His successor, King Chulalongkorn, expressed his distaste of the waste of labour and money, and ordered that a simple structure be built for his cremation instead. Since then, royal funerals have employed such simplified designs for the merumat and men, and the terms are now only used to distinguish the rank of the deceased. Following cremation, the merumat or men is disassembled and the components and materials are usually donated to Buddhist temples or to charity. Materials from the men of Prince Siriraj Kakudhabhand in 1888, for example, were used to build Siriraj Hospital. Royal funeral chariots Restoration work on the Royal Chariot of Great Victory during preparations for King Bhumibol's cremation in 2017 As the merumat is being built, restoration and maintenance work is also done to prepare the royal funeral chariots for the cremation ceremony procession, and practice sessions are held. Prior to cremation A few days prior to the cremation ceremony, phusa mala officials will remove the body from the kot in order to remove the materials used during sukam sop, and re-wrap the body in a new shroud. In the past, the partially- decomposed flesh would also be removed and stripped from the bones, in order to be cremated separately, but embalming has rendered this process unnecessary. The sukam sop materials, together with the bodily fluids collected in the tham phra buppho, are cremated in a small ceremony known as '. (This was not done for recent royal funerals where the body was placed in a coffin; the last time this ceremony happened was prior to the 2012 royal cremation of Princess Bejaratana.) The kot will be carried to the merumat or men on the day of the cremation ceremony (see below). Sometimes, however, the body might actually be moved from its place of enshrinement before the morning of the procession, in an unofficial step that is not part of the ceremonies. It takes place at night, somewhat secretly, leading the practice to be known as ' (lit. \\"stealing of the body\\"). This is done out of necessity or for convenience, e.g. in cases where the site is far from the procession route, or, in modern times, where body is placed in a coffin rather than the kot. It is an old tradition dating back to the Ayutthaya kings which saves time for the royal funeral procession within hours. Cremation ceremony The royal cremation ceremonies were historically elaborate and celebratory events. Those for the king usually lasted fourteen days and nights, and included processions of relics of the Buddha, fireworks, and days of festivities. Today, it usually lasts about five days, and mainly consists of funeral processions bringing the royal body to the merumat or men, the cremation, and processions returning the cremated remains and ashes to the palace. This section will describe the current rituals for the highest-ranking royals (those held in Sanam Luang), and use merumat to refer to both merumat or men, for simplicity. Funeral processions The Royal Chariot of Great Victory, bearing the urn of Princess Galyani Vadhana in the second procession to the men, November 2008 Final Buddhist rites are held in the evening before the cremation ceremony. The following morning, the kot carrying the royal remains is carried to the merumat via a series of funeral processions. In the first procession, the kot is brought onto the royal palanquin known as . It is then carried from Dusit Maha Prasat Throne Hall, out of the Grand Palace, and to the front of Wat Pho, where it is transferred to the royal funeral chariot (either the Maha Phichai Ratcharot or Vejayanta Ratcharot). The second procession‚Äîthe most elaborate‚Äîthen proceeds towards and enters Sanam Luang, where the kot is transferred either again to Phra Yannamat Sam Lam Khan, or to a royal gun carriage (for kings who held the title of Head of the Armed Forces or royal family members holding high military ranks in the Royal Thai Armed Forces, a tradition initiated on the wishes of King Vajiravudh in 1926). The third procession then circumambulates the merumat three times in a counter-clockwise fashion, before the kot is brought into the merumat. During the processions, ceremonial music is played, and gun salutes are fired. Cremation As the kot is brought onto the pyre (known as ') within the merumat, the outer shell is removed and replaced with a shell of carved sandalwood known as '. Further Buddhist rites are held, until the cremation takes place in the evening. During the first cremation, which is a mock ceremonial burning, the king lights the cremation fire and lays the first '‚Äîartificial flowers made of sandalwood and used ceremonially in cremations. The other guests then follow suit, laying flowers one by one. The ritual is repeated later in the night, with a smaller group of guests, when the actual cremation takes place. On the first lighting a 21-gun salute and a three-volley salute are both fired in the Sanam Luang field. Interment of remains and ashes The Royal Cemetery at Wat Ratchabophit serves as one of the final resting places of the royal ashes. The day after the cremation, a ceremony takes place where the cremated remains and ashes are viewed and placed in smaller urns. The remains (') are placed in a small kot known as ', while the ashes (') are placed in a rounder-shaped urn called '. They are then transported back to the Grand Palace in a fourth procession after a morning service and breakfast by the monks. The remains are brought into the Dusit Maha Prasat Throne Hall, while the ashes are temporarily placed in the Phra Si Rattana Chedi stupa in Wat Phra Kaew. The next day, final Buddhist rites are held for the cremated remains in the morning, before the kot is transported the short distance to Chakri Maha Prasat Throne Hall, where the remains will be interred, in the fifth procession. The sixth procession carries the royal ashes to the temple where they will be interred, usually at Wat Ratchabophit, where the Royal Cemetery is located, unlike the five past processions in current royal funerals the ashes are transported to the interment site in a royal automobile with escorts provided by the 29th Cavalry Squadron, Royal Horse Guards. Entertainment Entertainments and theatrical performances used to feature largely during royal cremation ceremonies, but were discontinued during the funeral of King Chulalongkorn. The practice was revived, at the suggestion of Princess Sirindhorn, during the funeral of Princess Mother Srinagarindra in 1996. Modern developments Phra kot chan of Princess Bejaratana at the Bangkok National Museum As an ongoing tradition, royal funerals have undergone changes and adaptations throughout the years. Much of the ceremony has been simplified since the funeral of King Chulalongkorn, and the development of embalming has changed the body-handling process. Recent developments introduced in the late twentieth century include live television broadcasts of the ceremony, as well as increased public participation. The public was first allowed to symbolically participate in the royal bathing ceremony in front of royal portraits during the funeral of Princess Mother Srinagarindra, and was allowed to co-host the funeral rites in the funeral of Princess Galyani Vadhana in 2008. The phra kot chan of Queen Rambai Barni, Princess Mother Srinagarindra, Princess Galyani Vadhana and Princess Bejaratana have also been preserved, instead of being burnt in the pyre. Electric furnaces were introduced in the cremation ceremonies of Princess Galyani Vadhana. Related traditions Similar royal funerary traditions are observed in Cambodia and, historically, in Laos, as the countries historically shared the same cultural sphere as Thailand. In Cambodia, the late King Norodom Sihanouk received a royal cremation in 2013, more than 50 years after the ceremony was last held. The last royal cremation to take place in Laos was that of King Sisavang Vong in 1961; the country was later taken over by the Communists, and its last king, Sisavang Vatthana, died in captivity.

The show is itself based on the characters created by DC Comics set in the Batman mythology. The episode was written by co-executive producers Steven Lilien and Bryan Wynbrandt and directed by Mark Tonderai. It was first broadcast on October 5, 2017. In the episode, Gordon travels to Miami in order to get Carmine Falcone's help in taking down Cobblepot for good. There, he meets with Falcone's daughter, Sofia, who also seems to take an interest in him. However, he soon discovers the truth: Falcone is dying and due to his health conditions, he can't leave the city. Meanwhile, Bruce continues discovering more about Ra's al Ghul and finds out about his origin and a certain item he takes an interest on: a 2,000 year old knife. He then competes with Barbara to get the knife. Meanwhile, Nygma is finally unfrozen by an obsessive fan but discovers he may not be the same as before. The episode received positive reviews with critics praising Bruce's character development as well as the cinematography but Gordon's storyline attracted mixed response. Plot In Arabia 125 A.D., a man on a horse is crossing a battlefield where many soldiers have died and takes an interest in one of them (Alexander Siddig). He takes the man to the Lazarus Pit, reviving him. He tells the man that he's his new heir and is given a dagger to take on the mantle of Ra's al Ghul. Back to the present day, Bruce (David Mazouz) investigates a new merchandise that arrived at the docks at Cobblepot's (Robin Lord Taylor) name but finds a thief advancing to the boat. The thief arrives at a truck to steal the product but Bruce is caught by the guards. He manages to defeat them and escape but the thief also escapes, revealing to be Selina (Camren Bicondova). Meanwhile, Gordon (Ben McKenzie) travels to Miami to meet with Falcone (John Doman). He joins Falcone at a table, also accompanied by Sofia (Crystal Reed), Falcone's only daughter. He asks for Falcone's help in taking down Cobblepot but Falcone says he can't because he's dying and leaving the city would be risky for his health. Sofia then volunteers to stay with Gordon while he remains in Miami. Later, while meeting up at the beach, they end up kissing. While Cobblepot and Zsasz (Anthony Carrigan) leave the club, a woman (Ilana Becker) uses a blowtorch to free Nygma (Cory Michael Smith) from his frozen state. She takes him to her hideout where Nygma gets shocked to discover that she's obsessed with him. The woman, Myrtle Jenkins, who went to school with him, reveals she is his \\"number one fan\\". She wants him to regain his strength so he can be \\"Gotham's greatest villain\\" with her as his sidekick, \\"The Riddlette\\". However, he begins to show signs of brain damage from the freezing process when he can't answer riddles and escapes. Meanwhile, Bruce inspects the freighter and discovers that the merchandise is a black market auction in Cobblepot's club. He is confronted by the guards until Alfred shows up and beats the guards. Barbara (Erin Richards) meets with Cobblepot to get a certain knife before the auction but is refused. Bruce and Alfred discover that the knife was used to embalm King Balahsi, ruler of ancient Mesopotamia in the first century. They also discover in an ancient book an image of Ra's, an image taken 2,000 years ago. Bruce and Alfred attend the auction and Bruce takes the role of billionaire brat in order to get the knife. After battling with Barbara for the bidding, Bruce wins the knife for 2 million dollars. Later that night, Selina sneaks into Wayne Manor to retrieve it when she's confronted by Bruce. Bruce refuses to give back the knife and tells her to leave. Gordon returns to Gotham and is shocked to find Sofia there, seemingly wanting to help him. Cobblepot and Zsasz confront Myrtle for unfreezing Nygma. When she reveals Nygma's damaged mind, Cobblepot has Zsasz kill her. Meanwhile, in the streets, a confused Nygma sees posters for Cobblepot's club. Later, Barbara is confronted by Ra's. After a brief fight, they both talk about the knife. Ra's takes even more interest in Bruce after learning he has the knife and they both kiss.

Critical reviews \\"A Dark Knight: They Who Hide Behind Masks\\" received positive reviews from critics. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"good\\" 7.8 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"'They Who Hide Behind Masks' honed in sharply on Bruce's vigilante tutelage at the hands of Alfred, who encouraged him to not only take on different personas, but to strongly play up a public 'spoiled brat' facade to achieve his goals. It worked really well thanks to Bruce's commitment and Alfred's savvy advice. Sure, there was some silliness to endure, but overall this was a good outing.\\" Nick Hogan of TV Overmind gave the episode a 4 star rating out of 5, writing \\"Overall I'd say this was Gotham Season 4's strongest episode yet. I'm so glad to see things working again that aren't ripped directly from a film.\\" Sydney Bucksbaum of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \\"Thanks to some advice from Alfred (Sean Pertwee) in this week's Gotham, Bruce (David Mazouz) invented his most famous character yet in his quest to be a secret vigilante by night by pretending to be a rich, obnoxious brat during the day.\\" Vinnie Mancuso of Collider wrote, \\"By now, we all know what it looks like when Bruce Wayne became Batman; we've watched a hundred times as he realized his tactical mask would be more effective with tiny, pointy ears, observed him sanding town perfectly good ninja stars until they look vaguely like bats, witnessed his parents' murder so many times we're all technically responsible on a moral level by this point. But 'They Who Hide Behind Masks' ‚Äî an incredibly serious title for an incredibly silly episode of Gotham ‚Äî marked a rare time that we got to watch Bruce Wayne become 'Bruce Wayne' for the first time.\\" Lisa Babick of TV Fanatic gave the series a 3.5 star rating out of 5, writing \\"'They Who Hide Behind Masks' was a mixed bag.

Alex manages to escape and Bruce needs to find him to know everything he wants from the knife. Meanwhile, Cobblepot and Sofia set to make business together but this brings big consequences for Sofia. Nygma also continues wanting to regain his previous persona after struggling through his Riddler persona. The episode received positive reviews from critics, who highlighted the writing, Alexander Siddig's performance and the development of Bruce Wayne's storyline. Plot Bruce (David Mazouz) and Alfred (Sean Pertwee) take the knife for inspection to antiquist Niles Winthrop (Dakin Matthews). He is soon joined by his grandson, Alex (Benjamin Stockham), who takes an interest in the knife as well and set to give him the information the next day. Meanwhile, Nygma (Cory Michael Smith) is setting on to have new riddles and also sets to get his revenge on Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor). That night, Niles discovers a message from the symbols with something related to \\"The Demon's Head\\". According to a legend, a man had the ability to resurrect and went by the name of \\"Ra's al Ghul\\". Then, Ra's (Alexander Siddig) arrives looking for the knife. Niles has Alex hidden and when he refuses to give the location, gets his neck snapped by Ra's. Gordon (Ben McKenzie) is called to investigate the scene when Bruce comes in and finds Niles' body. After giving away Alex's involvement, Bruce mentions to Gordon that Barbara (Erin Richards) also wanted the knife. Ra's meets with Barbara and introduces her to \\"Anubis\\", a man manipulated to act like a dog to track the knife. Cobblepot has a meeting with Sofia (Crystal Reed) in his office in order to discuss business. He then receives a message from a man sent by Nygma, asking to meet in the pier. Gordon goes to interrogate Barbara but their meeting is interrupted by Bruce, who accuses Barbara of working with Ra's but she denies his involvement. They then find Alex in a library but they are attacked by the Anubis and an assassin (Owen Harn), looking for the knife. They manage to beat them and escape to the precinct but Bruce and Alex flee. There, Gordon is met by Ra's, who claims to be a Nanda Parbat officer. While questioning, Alfred interrupts and attacks Ra's after recognizing him and then he disappears. Sofia meets with many of Falcone's loyal mobsters but they are intercepted by Cobblepot and Zsasz (Anthony Carrigan). While Zsasz executes them, Cobblepot tells Sofia he used her in order to get him close to the mob connections to avoid competition. He then receives another message from Nygma for another meeting as he failed to find him. Bruce and Alex flee to the National Museum but they are attacked by the assassin and Anubis. Gordon arrives and kills both of them. Ra's shows up and holds Alex hostage, demanding the knife. Bruce refuses to give him the knife, as it's extremely important. An impressed Ra's kills Alex and lets himself get arrested. Nygma shows up in Cobblepot's club, demanding to meet him. Cobblepot appears and explains that he didn't show up because his riddles are nonsense and illogical despite Nygma claiming the riddle was right. Cobblepot manages to make him see that his high intelligence is gone and he's no longer Edward Nygma. He's about to have Victor Fries (Nathan Darrow) to freeze Nygma again but changes his mind, deciding that he will live, but not known as The Riddler and humiliated at never been the same. Sofia meets with Gordon to discuss what happened to Cobblepot. After an argument, they kiss passionately. Meanwhile, Ra's is being escorted to prison, smiling, implying this is part of his plan.

Writing Ben McKenzie made his writing debut on the episode, after previously directing the third-season episode, \\"These Delicate and Dark Obsessions\\". McKenzie went to Los Angeles to work on the writers' room to break the story and then go back to New York City and finish many drafts. He explained, \\"I've been fiddling around with writing for a long time, but I'd never written an episode of television, so it was quite a learning process.\\" He also added that, \\"From being on a set, the directing came fairly naturally. It was challenging, but there were a lot of things that I understood about directing just from observing, just from watching director's work. Writing often takes place behind-the-scenes. Physical production is not privy to how scripts come out... I wasn't so familiar with that process of breaking a story, of starting with a story document, then an outline, and then a draft; it was informative\\" Casting Morena Baccarin, Camren Bicondova, Jessica Lucas, Chris Chalk and Drew Powell don't appear in the episode as their respective characters.

The feral, fanged dog-man Anubis and his mute brute of an owner made for intimidating enough villains-of-the-week; throwing a bone out a window isn't the most inventive way of dispatching with an antagonist, but given Gothams history I'm just glad it didn't involve a water bowl.\\" Lisa Babick of TV Fanatic gave the series a 4.5 star rating out of 5, writing \\"I can't believe Ra's al Ghul slit Alex's throat. I mean I can believe it, but it doesn't take away from the shock of it.

It is the first rose cultivar commercially developed by British rose breeder, David C.H. Austin. 'Constance Spry' was introduced at a time when the shrub rose was out of style, the hybrid tea rose being the most popular rose with gardeners. The new cultivar renewed the popularity of the more old fashioned type of rose. Description 'Constance Spry' is a vigorous, spreading shrub, 8 to 20 ft (243-609 cm) in height, with a 6 to 8 ft spread (182-243 cm). It has been described as a \\"lanky grower\\" it can be grown as a climber or large shrub. It blooms in clusters of medium to large, fully double flowers, which are cupped and globular in shape. The blooms are pale pink on the outside, and a deeper, darker pink within. The rose is noted for its strong, distinctive \\"myrhh like\\" scent, a characteristic inherited by many of its descendants. It blooms once a year for four weeks in late spring or early summer. The plant has abundant foliage and flexible canes that are easy to train. History 'Constance Spry' was the first rose developed commercially by David C.H. Austin, an amateur rose breeder at the time, living in Shropshire, England. Austin was interested in developing new rose cultivars that would look and smell like old fashioned roses. One of his early successes was crossing the Gallica rose, Rosa ‚ÄòBelle Isis‚Äô, and the floribunda, Rosa ‚ÄòDainty Maid‚Äô. Among the resulting seedlings was a strong, sweet smelling rose with large pink flowers. Austin showed the new cultivar to his friend and legendary horticulturalist, Graham Thomas, who showed the rose to Hillings Nursery. The nursery introduced the new cultivar in 1961. 'Constance Spry' is considered the first of the modern ‚ÄúEnglish Roses.‚Äù Developed at a time when the hybrid tea rose was the most common style marketed to gardeners, the success of 'Constance Spry' renewed the popularity of a more old fashioned type of rose. The rose is named after gardening educator, author, and florist Constance Spry. Spry collected old roses from the 1930s and 1940s, and traveled extensively through Britain during World War II, giving talks to women's groups on gardening and flower arranging. She was a talented flower arranger and wrote many popular books on the subject. Despite its only once a year flowering, the charm of 'Constance Spry's old fashioned appearance proved popular enough to prove there was a market for \\"reproduction\\" style roses. Austin continued his breeding program with 'Constance Spry' was further crossed with both modern and older roses, resulting in the fully remontant Rosa 'Wife of Bath' (1969), Rosa 'The Yeoman', 1969 and Rosa 'Chaucer' (1970), from which many of his later roses descended. 'Constance Spry' was awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit in 1993.

Between 1940 and 1956 she directed her own charanga danzonera, being the first woman to direct any such orchestra in Cuba. During her career she composed many popular danzones such as \\"Lleg√≥ Manolo\\", \\"El bajo que come chivo\\", \\"Los j√≥venes del agua fria\\" and the famous \\"Isora Club\\", which became a standard in the Latin music repertoire. Life and career Juana Coralia L√≥pez Vald√©s was born in Havana, Cuba, on May 6, 1910, into a family of musicians. Her father, Pedro L√≥pez, taught her music since she was child. Soon she was employed as a musician, choosing the piano as her preferred instrument. Her older brother, Orestes, nicknamed \\"Macho\\", was a multi-instrumentalist playing the bass, cello and piano, while her younger brother Israel, nicknamed \\"Cachao\\", specialized in the bass. Both Orestes and Israel joined Antonio Arca√±o y sus Maravillas in the 1930s. Coralia, started her own orchestra in 1940, and the following year she debuted her composition \\"Isora Club\\", dedicated to one of the many clubs where she played with her band. It won the 1941 danz√≥n contest organized by Radio Mil Diez. In 1943, the song was recorded by Arca√±o, and many other covers would follow over the years, including Cachao's (1958, 1993), Orquesta Arag√≥n's (1960) and Rub√©n Gonz√°lez's (2000). Coralia's charanga featured flutist Edelmiro P√©rez, g√ºirist Alfredo Lazo, timbalero Armando Lazo, singer Rub√©n Cortada, bassist Pepito Seoani, and a violin section with Ra√∫l Vald√©s, Jes√∫s Lanza, Tom√°s Reisoto and Enrique Jorr√≠n, who would later join the Maravillas, Orquesta Am√©rica and in 1951 create the chachach√°. Coralia's nephew, bassist Orlando \\"Cacha√≠to\\" L√≥pez (son of Orestes), began his career in her band. Despite their many live performances and original compositions, the group never made a recording before their dissolution in 1956.

History  The university was founded in 2017 by Thomas Bachem, Manuel Dolderer and Jonathan R√ºth, along with 24 internet entrepreneurs and startup investors. It was officially recognized on July 14, 2017 by the Senate of Berlin department for science and research. Bachem stated that his personal experience learning that German universities‚Äô computer science study programs were of an outdated didactic and theoretical nature sparked the idea for CODE. Being an autodidact coder since his early youth, he saw no fitting institution for his kind.  Supporters  Known supporters of CODE are Rolf Schr√∂mgens (founder of Trivago), Benjamin Otto (heir of the Otto Group), Stephan Schambach, Patrick Adenauer, Ijad Madisch (founder of ResearchGate), Verena Pausder (founder of Fox and Sheep), Heiko Hubertz (founder of Bigpoint), Rafael Laguna (founder of Open-Xchange), Gabriele Pulverm√ºller (formerly Host Europe Group), Klaas Kersting (founder of Gameforge), Florian Heinemann (founder of Project A) and Christian Vollmann (a.o. founder of EDarling). According to Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, ‚ÄúCODE University is doing important work educating the next generation of students in advanced technological skills.‚Äù She is ‚Äú(...)confident those students will go on to do incredible things ‚Äì they‚Äôll change our communities, our industries, and the world.‚Äù  Curriculum   Courses  The university offers three international English-language Bachelor's degree courses, each being six semesters long: * Software Engineering (B.S.) * Interaction Design (B.A.) * Product Management (B.A.) All three courses are accredited by the German state and matching the European Bologna process.  Didactics  CODE‚Äôs learning approach can be described as competency-orientated, self- directed and problem-based, namely by using concepts such as Mastery Learning, Flipped Classroom and Peer Learning. Aside from the subject-specific competences, the curriculum addresses topics like personal development and the ability to reflect oneself by implementation of a mentoring program. From the beginning, students are working project-based and self-regulated in interdisciplinary teams of software developers, interaction designers and product managers. Those projects are created and selected in close cooperation with a number of companies and organisations. All offered courses are grounded on a common competence framework. Upon start, each student receives an individual profile based on their already existing abilities to enhance and develop in their course of studies. The interdisciplinary Science, Technology & Society Program is meant to confront the students with the effects of their work on questions of science, technological progress and society.  Admission process  All potential applicants have to go through a multi- level admission process in which classical measuring tools like school grades or certificates are completely irrelevant. The four-step admission process consists of a written online motivation letter, a video interview, an exemplary project \\"challenge\\" and finally joining an Assessment day. According to the university, out of 2000 applicants from over 25 countries, 88 students were selected to join the very first winter semester of 2017.  Tuition fees  CODE University is financed by tuition fees that can be paid via a socially responsible, subsequent income-adjusted tuition-fee model. This way, the entire studies stay free of charge for any student for the course of their studies. This reversed generation agreement is realized by Chancen eG, following the example of Witten/Herdecke University‚Äôs StudierendenGesellschaft. After finishing their studies, students agree to repay the university a certain percentage of their income for several years. According to the university, more than 80% of all their students are opting for this model.  Campus  The university‚Äôs facilities are part of the Berlin-based startup campus and community space Factory Berlin. Its 14.000 m¬≤ are located in Lohm√ºhlenstra√üe, Alt-Treptow, next to G√∂rlitzer Park. Due to a close partnership, all students are free to use the overall 23.000 m¬≤ of Factory‚Äôs Berlin facilities as well as the included membership perks for free.  Organizations and engagement  The founding team of the university also founded and financed the nonprofit organization Code+Design Initiative e.V. which offers nationwide vacation coding camps for children and adolescents in Germany. Aiming to spark young people‚Äôs interest for digital technology and related professions, the organization also heavily focuses on raising the percentage of female professionals in the industry. Furthermore, it co- releases an annual magazine on studies and job orientation in design and coding in association with the publishing house Klett Group.

He was a fast and precocious two-year-old who won his first six races including the National Stakes and the Norfolk Stakes and went on to record his biggest win in the Group 1 Phoenix Stakes. He failed to win in four starts as a three-year-old and was then retired to stud. He had moderate results as a breeding stallion. Background Superpower was a bay horse bred in England by Mr & Mrs D A Hicks. During his racing career he was owned by Mrs Poh-Lian Yong and trained by Bill O'Gorman at Newmarket, Suffolk. O'Gorman had built his reputation by training precociously fast two-year-olds, most notably the 1984 British Horse of the Year Provideo. He was sired by Superlative who was trained by O'Gorman to win the July Stakes and the Flying Childers Stakes in 1983. The best of his other progeny was the German-trained Kornado whose wins included the Group 1 Grosser Preis von Berlin. Superpower's dam Champ d'Avril was a \\"useful\\" sprinter who won two races from eleven starts. Racing career 1988: two-year-old season Superpower was ridden in his first eight races by Tony Ives. The colt made his debut in a maiden race over five furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 14 April and won by a length from Windsor Park after taking the lead soon after the start. Superpower quickly ran up a sequence of wins, taking minor events over five furlongs at Newmarket on 29 April, Windsor on 16 May and Folkestone on 23 May. On 31 May he was stepped up in class for the Listed National Stakes over five furlongs at Sandown Park and started 3/1 second favourite behind the Ian Balding-trained Optaria. He led for most of the way and ran on well in the closing stages to win by a length from Shuttlecock Corner. Superpower was moved up again in class for the Group 3 Norfolk Stakes at Royal Ascot on 16 June. Starting the even money favourite against nine opponents he took the lead soon after the start and won \\"comfortably\\" by two and a half lengths to take his winning run to six. On 5 July Superpower started 4/11 favourite for the Chesterfield Stakes at Newmarket but sustained his first defeat as he was overtaken in the final strides and beaten into second place by the outsider Four-Legged Friend. Later that month he was sent to France for the Prix Robert Papin over 1100 metres at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse and came home third of the nine runners behind Philippi. Walter Swinburn took over the ride when the colt was sent to Ireland to contest the Group 1 Phoenix Stakes over six furlongs at Phoenix Park Racecourse on 7 August. The French filly Tersa (winner of the Prix du Bois) started favourite ahead of Heather Seeker (Curragh Stakes) and Gloriella (Queen Mary Stakes) with Superpower next in the betting on 6/1. The colt started quickly, took the lead in the opening strides and was never headed, winning \\"easily\\" by three lengths from Run To Jenny. At the end of August Superpower was beaten when odds-on favourite for a minor race at York: he had raced along the rail while the winner Madam Millie took advantage of the faster ground down the centre of the track. Willie Carson took the ride for the colts final race of the season, when he finished fourth behind Shuttlecock Corner in the Flying Childers Stakes at Doncaster in September. 1989: three-year-old season As a three-year-old Superpower was campaigned exclusively over sprint distances and although he failed to win in four starts he produced some good performances in defeat. Ives rode him in his first three races. On his debut he was matched against older horses in the Palace House Stakes at Newmarket in May and put up oe of his best efforts as he took the lead two furlongs out before being run down in the final strides and beaten a head by the four-year-old filly Silver Fling. He finished fourth in the Temple Stakes at Sandown later in May and was then off the course for more than two months before running ninth in the King George Stakes. After another lengthy break he ended his career by coming home sixth of the eleven runners in the Diadem Stakes at Ascot in September. Stud record Superpower was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion. He sire many minor winners over sprint distances, but no top class performers. His last recorded foals were born in 2003. Pedigree *Superpower was inbred 4 √ó 4 to Matador, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

Pre-accident Chee started playing table tennis at the age of 5, eventually representing Westlake Primary School in the sport. He then studied at Guangyang Secondary School, where he joined the Boys' Brigade due to his admiration of their uniforms and marching. Then, Chee moved on to study at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, which he graduated from. His father, Chee Kwok Chor, aged 75/76 in 2017 and of Shanghainese descent, worked as a vegetable seller until his retirement in 2011. Chee told of learning perseverance from his father, who for over 40 years refused to take a holiday from his work: collecting vegetables at 11.30pm from Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre, and selling them the next day at Jalan Besar until 1pm. His mother, Chua Ah Lek, was a seamstress who died in 2011 due to kidney failure at the age of 65. Chee has described his mother as having a no-nonsense attitude, who brought her only child to swimming lessons and cooking lessons (cooking was her passion), and also made him learn the computer, the electric organ and taekwondo. Chee quoted that his mother wanted him to learn more skills so that he would not \\"lose to anyone\\". Chee has also told of his late mother's wisdom having made him stronger in dealing with his challenges. Accident and recovery (2012‚Äì2013) At the time of his accident, Chee was serving as a Singapore Armed Forces regular serviceman in the Republic of Singapore Navy with a rank of Military Expert-2. On 10 December 2012, while on board the RSS Endeavour at Changi Naval Base, Chee suffered a serious accident when he was caught between a motorised winch and a berthing rope he was checking on. The incident caused Chee to lose both his legs, his left arm (with his dominant left hand), one whole right finger and parts of two other right fingers. Chee's accident resulted in Singaporeans coming forward to donate O+ blood, prompting the National Blood Programme to assure that there were already enough blood supplies for Chee and \\"clarify that directed and replacement donations (where families and friends are obliged to donate blood for the patient or to replace blood used by the patient) are not practised in Singapore\\". Chee was hospitalized until June 2013. He had suffered from phantom limb pain for three or four months, but had dealt with it by not thinking of his missing limbs. Beginning para table tennis; ASEAN team gold (2013‚Äì2016) In June 2013, Chee began playing para table tennis while equipped with prosthetic fingers; his efforts were supported by the Singapore Disability Sports Council. He formerly played table tennis with his left hand, but since his left arm had been amputated, he had to learn to play para table tennis with his right hand. In September 2013, Chee won two gold medals in para table tennis at Singapore's 8th National Disability League for para table tennis. At the January 2014 ASEAN Para Games, Chee debuted for the Singapore national team by teaming with Darren Chua to win the bronze medal for the men's team Class 3 para table tennis event. At the same Games, Chee also won a silver in the men's individual Class 2 para table tennis event. Chee has been coached by Chia Chong Boon. In June 2014, Chee returned to work in the Singapore Navy, it being 18 months after his accident; he was assigned to be an operations supervisor in 191 Squadron. Concurrently, Chee was also studying for a degree in mathematics at the Singapore University of Social Sciences; such education was a wish of his late mother. At the ITTF 3rd Taichung Table Tennis Open for the Disabled in August 2015, Chee won a bronze for the men's singles Class 2 event. In December 2015 at the 2015 ASEAN Para Games, Chee helped Singapore win their first gold medal for para table tennis at the ASEAN Para Games by winning both his singles matches and his doubles match with team-mate Aaron Yeo. As a result, Singapore overcame Thailand 3‚Äì1 in the men's team Class 1‚Äì2 contest for the gold. Eye cancer and ASEAN individual gold (2017‚Äìpresent)  In April 2017, Chee began to lose vision in his right eye due to a tumour. In May 2017, he was diagnosed with choroidal melanoma, a form of eye cancer. It was found that the cancer had not spread beyond his right eye, and that month Chee underwent successful surgery to remove his right eye; he was fully discharged from hospitalization in June 2017. The loss of his right eye affected Chee's depth perception, affecting his playing of para table tennis. In September 2017, Chee won a gold medal in the men's individual Class 2 para table tennis event during the 2017 ASEAN Para Games. At the same Games, Chee also won a bronze in the men's team Class 1‚Äì3 para table tennis event (compared to Class 1‚Äì2 in the previous Games, Class 1‚Äì3 can feature less impaired para-athletes). In an interview published in October 2017, Chee said that he uses prosthetic legs to walk short distances while at work, but with the prosthetics it would take him 10 minutes to walk 25 metres. In contrast, his wheelchair can travel up to 12 kilometres per hour. His role in the Navy at the time was a desk-bound training specialist at Changi Naval Base. Chee also told of his target to graduate with a degree in mathematics in 2019/2020. To this end, Chee decided to take a break from the competitive sports to concentrate on his studies at the Singapore University of Social Sciences. Hence, Chee gave up the opportunity defending his title in the 2020 ASEAN Para Games. Chee was engaged to his girlfriend of three years, Nonie Marasigan Dumas on 1 March 2020.

The Awlad had religious authority, and also owned agricultural settlements and engaged in trade. During the French occupation of Algeria they alternately cooperated with and opposed the colonialists. Origins The Awlad Sidi Shaykh trace their ancestry to the saint Sidi Shaykh, a descendant of Muhammad's father-in-law Abu Bakr, the first caliph. In the 16th century the growing population in the south-western Algerian Sahara created a need for more intense farming and for collaboration between farmers and nomads. Saint Sidi Shaykh founded a community of date farmers and nomads engaged in the caravan trade. A. G. P. Martin dates this to 1651, when the walis of the Tuat and Gurara brought the Sharifian ideology to the villages of the Zenata Berbers. The headquarters was a prayer-meditation center that taught the ethics of hard work and sharing among and between the farmers and nomads. Arab tribes in the Gurara and the Sahara such as the Khenafsa became faithful to the Awlad Sidi Shaykh, the mrabtin of the Saharan Atlas. As the population pressure slackened in the following centuries the Awlad Sidi Shaykh gradually took control of the prayer-meditation center and grew into a mid-sized tribe. The religious ideals of cooperation were replaced by a system where the Awlad Sidi Shaykh used alms to maintain their dominance. They became the dominant tribal and religious federation in the A√Øn Madhi region of the central northern Algerian desert. They owned houses and storage places in the Gourara and Tuat region, and controlled zawaya religious strongholds throughout the greater Tuat. The zawaya owned large gardens worked by slaves and served as markets and travel lodges. They sent their earnings to the mother zawiya in El Abiodh Sidi Cheikh in the northwest of Algeria. Descendants of the Awlad Sidi Shaykh lived in the zawaya, where they were known as Zuwa or Ahl 'Azzi. They also owned land in the Hoggar Mountains, where they were religious scholars, teachers and traders. In the Hoggar Mountains they established agricultural settlements using slave labour, and these sometimes became staging posts on trade routes. There were trading communities of the Awlad Sidi Shaykh far to the south in Timbuktu, Kidal and Agadez, and to the east in Ghadames and Ghat. The confederation often came under the influence of the Sultan of Morocco. Colonial era After the French invasion of Algiers in 1830 it became clear that they might try to occupy the whole country and impose a rule much less acceptable than that of the Turkish Bey. In 1831 the Duc de Rovigo caused a scandal in Algiers when he built a military highway through two functioning cemeteries with no respect for the human remains, and converted several mosques into Catholic churches. Algerians opposed to the French occupation came to accept 'Abd al-Qadir as leader of their movement. Some of the Awlad Sidi Shaykh recognized 'Abd al- Qadir as sultan, as did the powerful Banu Hashim and Banu 'Amir. These groups of the Oran Plateau and the Plain of Gharis accepted Muhyi al-Din, chief of the Qadiriyya Sufis, as the \\"Champion of Islam\\" against the French. In the 1840s the Awlad Sidi Shaykh assisted the Governor-General Thomas Robert Bugeaud in his struggle with the Emir 'Abd al-Qadir. However, in the southern desert regions they supported 'Abd al-Qadir. In the early 1850s the confederation was still divided. Some, led by Si Hamza, cooperated with the French. Others, led by Mohammed bin Abdallah, opposed them. Mausoleum of Sidi Shaykh in El Abiodh Sidi Cheikh Between 1864 and 1865 the Awlad Sidi Shaykh rose in rebellion against the French. The rebellion stopped southward French expansion near Oran. It was triggered by officers of the Arab Bureau (bureaux arabes) who were insensitive to the traditions of the Awlad. One of the main military leaders of the revolt was Si Sliman, head of one of the main families. The French suppressed the revolt through greatly superior force. Awlad Sidi Ahmad Majdub of the Amir Bedouin tribe of Morocco participated in the revolt, but was pardoned and placed in the Sebdou circle. The Awlad were restive during the Kabyle Revolt (1871‚Äì72) but did not play a major role. In the 1870s and 1880s local politics in Algeria were dominated by Europeans, commercial farming by French immigrants expanded, and funding for Islamic courts was cut, as was funding for schools that trained interpreters and judges. It was in this context that the Awlad Sidi Shaykh staged the last, desperate rural revolts along the frontier with Morcocco. Plans to destroy the second Flatters expedition of 1880‚Äì81 were made by the Kel Ahaggar Tuaregs of the Hoggar Mountains, the Awlad Sidi Shaykh confederation and the Senussi before the expedition left Ouargla. They knew the planned route and were kept informed by the expedition guides, who helped sabotage the expedition by leading it past wells. Six hundred men of the three tribes gathered to ambush the expedition near the wells of Bir el-Garama. The result was a massacre of half the expedition members, while many of the others died during a long retreat. Until 1883 the Awlad continued to occasionally mount raids against the colonialists. The rebellion in the southwest led by Cheikh Bouamama (Shaykh Bu 'Amamah) from 1881 to 1883 fell apart due to disagreements among the tribes. When Cheikh Bouamama retreated to Morocco in 1882 the French conquest of the south of Algeria was complete. After this the Awlad Sidi Shaykh largely accepted French authority. As the rebellion died down, the itinerant marabouts of the Awlad Sidi Shaykh turned to rebuilding their business, demanding donations to their shrine from the peasants, who still thought they had strong influence with God. The colonial administrator Alfred Le Chatelier, a relatively enlightened secularist and republican, succeeded in convincing the Mekhedma tribe of the Sud-Oranais that they need not pay tribute. There were still disturbances until 1902, and one of Awlad's leaders, Bu 'Imama, continued to resist until 1904.
