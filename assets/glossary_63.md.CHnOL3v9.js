Life  Chung So-Sung was born in Bonghwa, Gyeongsangbuk-do, in 1944. He received his bachelor's and master's degrees in French literature from Seoul National University. He then received his doctorate in French literature from the University of Grenoble III in France. From 1985 until 2009 he was the French literature professor at Dankook University’s college of liberal arts. In 1977. When Chung So-Sung was the French literature professor at Chonnam University’s college of education, he made his literary debut with the publication of his story “Jilju” (질주 Rush) in Hyundae Munhak. Toward the end of his study abroad in France, he published the novel Cheonnyeoneul naerineun nun (천년을 내리는 눈 The Snow of Thousand Years) in 1983. After he published Atene ganeun bae (아테네 가는 배 The Ship Bound for Athens) in early 1985, he won the Dongin Literary Award. Hwang Sun-Won, who was the judge for the award, has said the following of the story: “It is a great harvest to have gotten this work, which allowed us to profoundly reaffirm the pain of our division to the world.” Chung So-Sung has published 5 short story collections including Tteugeo-un gang (뜨거운 강 The Hot River), and has published 14 novels including Yeojaui seong (여자의 성 The Sex of Women), Daedongyeojido (대동여지도 Daedongyeojido, 5 Volumes), Taeyangin (태양인 The Sun People, 2 Volumes), Du anae (두 아내 Two Wives), and Seolhyang (설향). He strived to depict life's experiences, and he has shown a style of trying to approach the meaning of life in history through characters in his works. In the same year he was awarded the Dongin Literary Award, he also won the Yun Dongju Literature Award. In recognition of his career, he was awarded the Bonghwa Artist Award in 2015 from his hometown Bonghwa.\\"A Place For Classics: Who is Chung So- Sung?\\", Munhwa Ilbo, September 30th 2016.  Writing  The novella Atene ganeun bae (아테네 가는 배 The Ship Bound for Athens), which won the 17th Dongin Literary Award, is a unique and distinguished work of fiction that is written about the historical reality of the division of Korea in the theme of the mystification and the sense of fate around pain. It compares the division of Korea to Greek mythology. This work contains two meanings. One is related to the travels of the narrator Jongsik, and it can be said as a meaning of reality discovered within a mystical world. This is evident in the scene where the pain of division is implied through the story of the River Simois, one of the legends of Troy, and the pain crosses over from the world of myths to reality. The other is the meaning brought on by the journey of the protagonist, Juha, and this points to the fateful repetition of myths that occur again and again in reality. Juha is not able to achieve the dream of reuniting with his father, experiencing the agony of the pain in reality turning into that of the myth. Thus, this work is showing the contrasting effects of finding the reality of pain within a myth, and discovering the repetition of the myth of pain within reality. Therefore, as the story passes through the mythical world, it turns the tale of pain within the myth into that of the real world. Also, by showing the pain within reality, it connects that into the pain within the myth. His novel Du anae (두 아내 Two Wives, 2 Volumes), which handles the theme of the tragedy of a divided country. It depicts the scars of division through a family history. Han Cheol-wu, is a character in the book who had married in North Korea, but experienced the trauma of separation through the Korean War, and marries again in South Korea. Through this character, a somewhat familiar figure in Korean history, the author portrays a person who faces ideology. The novel is very lyrical, despite the setting of war, and it brings war into literature through its search for meaning in love and life, as well as its beautiful and unique style. Another important aspect that adds to the value of the work is that it has a fluent command of the dialects of Hamgyong-do, Pyongan-do, and Gyeongsang-do. Particularly, this work was selected by the Literature Translation Institute of Korea, a government funded organization, as the only work to be translated into French in 1999. It was translated by Jean-Paul Desgoutte from Paris 8 University and his wife, both academics. This has led to the recognition of the work's quality. As shown above, Chung So-Sung's works show the scars of division, and the pain of separation, through love and life. However, his writing does not only concern itself with ideological matters. He has great interest in Korean history. He has published works that are inspired by Korean history, such as Daedongyeojido (대동여지도 Daedongyeojido, 5 Volumes), which depicts the story of Kim Jeong-ho, a Silhak scholar of the Joseon Dynasty, as well as Taeyangin (태양인 The Sun People, 2 Volumes), which was tells the story of Lee Jema, a scholar, a military officer, and a doctor of the late Joseon Dynasty, and the origin of Sasang typology. In fact, Taeyangin (태양인 The Sun People, 2 Volumes), a historical novel about medicine, was once officially optioned by MBC for a TV series.\\"Showing the Inner Side of Humanity and Their Characteristics as Social Beings\\", Reader's News, March 19th 2008.

Her career as a farmworker began in 1929, and by the 1930s she was managing record numbers of beets in her harvests; in one year, 1947, she managed to harvest worth of beets. As a result, she was designated team leader for several beet farms in the Chuy Region. During World War II she worked to produce crops to aid the war effort, and took in a number of war orphans. Her abilities led Kaynazarova to receive a number of honors during her career. She received the Order of Lenin three times, in 1941, 1947, and 1948; in 1946 she was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour, and in 1948 and 1957 she was named a Hero of Socialist Labour. As a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union she was a deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR; she also serve as a member and vice-chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Kirghiz SSR. Kaynazarova retired in 1958 and died in 1982; in retirement she lived in Frunze, today Bishkek. She continues to be memorialized in her native country.

This and T. canus were respectively circumscribed and described in 1991 by the Australian entomologist David K. McAlpine. It is endemic to southern Australia. Taxonomic history David K. McAlpine of the Australian Museum circumscribed and named the genus This in a 1991 overview of Australian Coelopidae, which was published in the journal Systematic Entomology. In the same paper McAlpine named and described its type species T. canus, the only species included in the genus. McAlpine and Geoff Holloway collected the male T. canus holotype in 1971; it was deposited in the collections of the Australian Museum. Approximately 450 specimens of T. canus were designated as paratypes; collections holding paratypes include: the Australian Museum, the South Australian Museum, the Natural History Museum, London, the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle, Paris, and the National Museum of Natural History, Washington. McAlpine placed This in a new tribe, Coelopellini; he initially included three genera in this tribe: his new genera This and Rhis, as well as Coelopella, which John Russell Malloch circumscribed in 1933. McAlpine concurrently created the tribe Ammini, consisting of the genera Amma, Icaridion, and Beaopterus. Rudolf Meier and Brian Wiegmann conducted a phylogenetic study of twenty two species of Coelopidae based on genetic sequencing of EF-1α and 16S rDNA as well as morphological characteristics. Meier and Wiegmann argued that neither Coelopellini nor Ammini as McAlpine had circumscribed them were monophyletic, but that together they formed a clade. , the Tree of Life Web Project follows Meier and Wiegmann's phylogeny. In 2011, Smithsonian Institution entomologist and McAlpine combined Ammini with Coelopellini, resulting in an expanded, monophyletic tribe Coelopellini. The generic name This comes from the Ancient Greek word (thís), which means \\"sea shore\\", particularly in Homeric Greek. Some have found it humorous that This is a homograph of the English proximal demonstrative this. American entomologist Arnold S. Menke included This in a 1993 list of taxon names which he deemed to be either \\"funny\\" or \\"curious\\"; the list was printed in a biological humor magazine published by the American entomologist Neal L. Evenhuis. Menke also reported that McAlpine had a poster on his office door which illustrated a This specimen and was captioned \\"Look at This!\\". The specific name for its type species is a Latin adjective, , with meanings including \\"white\\", \\"grey-haired\\", and \\"foam-capped\\". Description { + T. Canus measurements (McAlpine) ! !

Standard error   } =Genus= In McAlpine's 1991 as well as Mathis and McAlpine's 2011 keys to Coelopidae genera, This and Rhis formed a couplet. Some of the characteristics distinguishing This from Rhis include: moderately long vibrissal setae at a prominent angle, the presence of two humeral, postpronotum bristles, and a deeply bilobed surstylus on males. Other generic features include a face whose profile is concave and which lacks a medial carina, short setulae on its cheeks. Its arista is shorter than the diameter of its eye, and the segment 6 is covered in short hairs. =Species= Both sexes of T. canus have a similar morphology. It has a pale grey head, a pale orange-brown cheek, orange-brown antennae, and a brown arista. Its thorax is light gray and is covered in black hairs. The legs are yellow or yellowish- brown. Both the tegulae and veins on its pale wings are yellow. The head is slightly narrower than the thorax, and the legs are stout. McAlpine provided similar measurements for both males and females, although Jennifer Blyth argued T. canus exhibited sexual dimorphism due to the males' wing size being on average 71.6% than that of the females in her study. Distribution The genus This is endemic to Australia, and T. canus is one of the most common species of Coelopidae in Australia. T. canus is found along the southern coast of Australia, and had been found in the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, and Western Australia. Its range also includes Clarke Island, off the coast of Tasmania. Its type locality is Dee Why, a suburb of Sydney. It has been documented as far north as Noosa, Queensland on the east coast and Geraldton, Western Australian on the west coast. It can also be found as far inland as Canberra. Biology Wrack on Dee Why Beach Ecklonia radiata, illustrated by W. J. Hooker T. canus, like other coelopids, is found on wrack seaweed found in the wrack zone of Australian beaches. K. R. Blanche of the University of New England conducted a field study and laboratory experiments on T. canus for a paper published in 1992. Her field observations were from May 1987 to May 1988 along the coastline of the City of Gosford, near Sydney. Collection sites included beaches in Pearl Beach, Killcare, Putty, MacMasters Beach, and Copacabana. She was able to collect T. canus specimens throughout the year, although their abundance varied, with peaks in June–August, December–January, and April. The average density of T. canus in each zone of wrack was approximately 2 flies per cubic meter (1.5/yd) of low wrack, 3.4 flies per cubic meter (2.6/yd) of mid wrack, and 2.8 flies per cubic meter (2.14/yd) of high wrack. The mid wrack is ideal for adults to gather and lay eggs due to its moisture and amount of decomposing seaweed; the decomposition emits various vapors which attract the kelp flies. Blanche's laboratory experiment found that T. canus was able to complete its life cycle on the kelp species Ecklonia radiata but not on the seagrass Zostera capricorni. There was a similar T. canus life cycle on both fresh, wet and old, wet E. radiata; they failed to successfully reproduce on dried E. radiata. Overall the life cycle took between six and nine weeks to complete. She concluded that Z. capricorni and dried E. radiata do not provide sufficient bacteria, which serves as a food source, or moisture for the larvae to develop. Jennifer Blyth, for her 2005 University of Leicester dissertation, studied the mating behavior of coelopids; one experiment examined the mating behavior of Chaetocoelopa littoralis, Chaetocoelopa sydneyensis, Gluma keyseri, Amma blanchae, and This canus in a laboratory setting. T. canus were collected at Forresters Beach, New South Wales and Asling's Beach, Twofold Bay; instead of inhabiting beds of wrack seaweed, which were not present at these sites, the T. canus were in \\"wrack strings\\", i.e., small pieces of dried seaweed. Blyth found that T. canus and A. blanchae had similar mating behavior, which was \\"markedly different\\" from the other three species examined. The mounting position of the male is far back on the female; he rests his prothoracic legs on her thorax unlike the other three species where he rests his legs on her antennae. There is no courtship display prior to mounting. Chaetocoelopa females might attempt to reject a male by kicking him for the first thirty seconds after he mounts her, although these kicks were ineffective for all but the smallest males. If the male managed to endure these thirty seconds, copulation would occur. Otherwise, the female exhibited minimal struggling behavior while being mounted. Females did not struggle when the males dismounted. Blyth concludes that sexual conflict is not as present for T. canus and A. blanchae as it is for the other species. On average, mount duration for T. canus was 91.9 seconds and copulation duration was 128.4 seconds. Most mounts (61.02%) resulted in copulation: 6.78% ended due to the male rejecting and 32.2% ended due to the female's rejection. Blyth also provided a quantitative analysis looking for any effects of size, which was quantified by measuring wingspan. The mounting duration correlated positively with female size, but had no significant correlation with male size. Blythe found no correlation between a male T. canus's desire to mate and the size of either the male or the female. Males did not show a significant preference for large females. Larger female were more successful at rejecting males.

The species is possibly extinct in Puerto Rico and Haiti. Description Zamia integrifolia produces reddish seed cones with a distinct acuminate tip. The leaves are 20–100 cm long, with 5-30 pairs of leaflets (pinnae). Each leaflet is linear to lanceolate or oblong-obovate, 8–25 cm long and 0.5–2 cm broad, entire or with indistinct teeth at the tip. They are often revolute, with prickly petioles. It is similar in many respects to the closely related Zamia pumila, but that species differs in the more obvious toothing on the leaflets.Linnaeus, Carl von f. 1789. Hortus Kewensis 3: 478 This is a low- growing plant, with a trunk that grows to 3–25 cm high, but is often subterranean. Over time, it forms a multi-branched cluster, with a large, tuberous root system, which is actually an extension of the above-ground stems. The leaves can be completely lost during cold periods, with the plant lying dormant in its tuberous root system, allowing this cycad to be relatively cold hardy. The plant can survive up to USDA region 8b (10° to 20° F). The stems and leaves regenerate after the cold period subsides with full foliage.Whitelock, L. M. (2002). The Cycads. Portland, OR: Timber Press. Like other cycads, Zamia integrifolia is dioecious, having male or female plants. The male cones are cylindrical, growing to 5–16 cm long; they are often clustered. The female cones are elongate-ovoid and grow to 5–19 cm long and 4–6 cm in diameter. Ediblity and toxicity =Ediblity= A strainer used by Seminoles to extract an edible starch from coontie root. Indigenous tribes of Florida like the Seminoles and Tequestas would grid the root and soak it overnight afterwards they would rinse it with running water for several hours to remove the rest of the water-soluble toxin cycasin. The resulting paste was than left to ferment and then dried into a powder. The resulting powder than could be used to make a bread-like substance. By the late 1880s, several mills in the Miami area started to produce Florida arrowroot until their demise after the World War 1. =Toxicity= The whole plant contains a toxin called cycasin which can cause liver failure that can lead to death but if proper precautions are taken can be leached with water due to it being a water- soluble molecule. The seeds contains a toxic glycoside which causes headaches, vomiting, stomach pains and diarrhoea if ingested. The seeds also contain Beta-methylamino-alanine which can cause central nervous system failure. Common names This plant has several common names. Two names, Florida arrowroot and wild sago, refer to the former commercial use of this species as the source of an edible starch. Coontie (or koonti) is derived from the Seminole Native American language conti hateka. Ecology Zamia integrifolia inhabits a variety of habitats with well-drained sands or sandy loam soils. It prefers filtered sunlight to partial shade. Populations are presently limited to Florida, southeastern Georgia, central Cuba and the Dominican Republic. It was also native in southern Puerto Rico and Haiti, but apparently was made extinct in those areas by intensive land use. The Eumaeus atala butterfly is dependent on the coontie for its survival Controversy has long existed over the classification of Zamia in Florida; at one extreme all the American populations have been included in a broadly defined Zamia pumilaEckenwalder, J. E. 1980. Taxonomy of the West Indian cycads. J. Arnold Arboretum 61: 701-722. and at the other several species have been recognized under various names (e.g., Z. augustifolia, Z. floridana, Z. silvicola, and Z. umbrosa). The Flora of North America treats all of the American populations as Z. integrifolia. Genetically, the differences between populations cannot be explained by habitat variability. Studies conducted by WardWard, D.B. (1978). Rare and Endangered Biota of Florida 5: 122-124. showed that five different Florida populations of Z. integrifolia with identical cultivation produced distinct leaf morphology, suggesting that there may be too much genetic diversity amongst these Florida Z. integrifolia, not to mention geographically isolated populations, to consider them a single species. The plant has critical importance to the Eumaeus atala butterfly. The butterfly, thought extinct until recently, is dependent for its survival on the Zamia integrifolia, as well as several other species of Zamia. At the larval stage, the Eumaeus atala caterpillar exclusively eats the leaves of the coontie. A half dozen caterpillars can completely strip a coontie bare and a large coontie population is needed to sustain the Eumaeus atala population. Mealybug destroyers, Cryptolaemus montrouzieri, are commonly found on Z. floridana. They form a mutualistic relationship by providing the plant protection from pests in exchange for food. They feed on the coonties' natural enemies, scales and mealybugs, thereby reducing the need for pesticides. = Parasites = Three of the most common pests of Z. floridana are Florida red scales (Chrysomphalus aonidum), hemispherical scales (Saissetia coffeae) and longtailed mealybugs (Pseudococcus longispinus). When infested, the plant's growth is stunted, and it becomes covered with blackish mold. Infestations are not limited to one species; several species can be found on the same plant. = Nitrogen-fixation = Since Z. floridana is a cycad, which are the only group of gymnosperms that form nitrogen-fixing associations, it depends on microbes as a source of nitrogen. It forms a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, which live in specialized roots called coralloid roots and are green in color despite not actively photosynthesizing. The filamentous cyanobacteria belonging to the genus Nostoc, which is able to form symbiosis with a wide range of organisms, inhabits the mucilage in the microaerobic and dark intercellular zone in between the inner and outer cortex of coralloid roots. This zone is transversed and connected by elongated Zamia cells. Coralloid roots are just like lateral roots, but highly specialized to contain cyanobacteria.  Reproduction  The cones, also called strobilus, of Z. floridana are dioecious. The male strobilus and the female strobilus are found on two separate plants. The cones on the female plant are thick and have red-orange seeds. They also have a velvety texture, and only grow up to 6 inches. On the other hand, the ones on the male plant are narrow and tall, and contain pollen. They can reach a length of 7 inches. Female cones are usually borne singularly, whereas male cones grow in groups or clusters. The growing season of Z. floridana is during the spring, and the sex of the plant is undetermined until cones are produced. = Multiple cones = Zamia species often produce more than one cone close to the tip of the stem or at the terminal of the caudex where it intersects with the aboveground stem. The multiple cones of Z. floridana may develop through three methods: sympodium, forking of the bundle system, and adventitious buds. The most common form of development is the rapid formation of cone domes on the plant's sympodium, which is its main axis. More cones are present when there is a \\"branching\\" of the bundles to the cones. The forking of the bundle system starts near the base of a terminal cone, which remains erect, of the sympodial development in certain branches. The last method is when \\"adventitious buds appear in the cortical tissue closely connected with the stelar system of the trunk, and these buds continue their development like typical stems.\\" = Pollination = Z. floridana plants are pollinated by two species of weevils, Rhopalotria slossoni and Pharaxonotha floridana. P. floridana pollinates the plants by using the pollen-bearing strobili as food for its larvae, transporting the pollen with it. The plant can regulate the mutualistic interaction by making the seed-bearing strobilis poisonous to these larvae. On the other hand, R. slossoni does not consume the pollen, but rather, takes shelter in male cones where they become dusted with pollen. They then carry over these pollen into the female cones, which becomes pollinated. Although the female cones are not consumed, there have been evidences of healed scars due to punctation in the interior of the cone, which are suspected to be caused by weevils.

Bampton has sat on a number of high profile cases, including finding that Cy Walsh was not guilty of the murder of his father Phil Walsh because he was mentally incompetent. Bampton was a member of the Full Court of the Supreme Court that dismissed an appeal against a redistribution of the electoral districts of South Australia. Drink driving On Saturday 30 November 2013, shortly after Bampton's appointment to the Supreme Court, she was driving after consuming alcohol when she hit and injured a cyclist at Glenside. A breath test indicated that Bampton had a blood alcohol content of 0.121%, a category 2 offence, and was immediately disqualified from driving for six months. Bampton pleaded guilty to driving with excess blood alcohol and driving without due care, was fined $1,300, plus court costs of $260 and disqualified from driving for a further eight months and 14 days. Bampton was the fourth Australian judge to commit a drink driving offense, after District Court (SA) judge Neal Hume (2002), Supreme Court (NSW) judge Jeff Shaw (2004), and acting Judge of Appeal (NSW) Roderick Howie (2011). Hume and Shaw resigned their commissions while Howie's acting commission was allowed to lapse. In South Australia a judge can only be removed by the Governor upon the address of both Houses of the Parliament. Bampton did not resign nor did the Parliament seek her removal. The Chief Justice Chris Kourakis decided that for twelve months Bampton would not be allocated to cases involving a driving offence nor where an offender was \\"materially affected by alcohol\\". Subsequently NSW Court of Appeal Judge Anthony Meagher was found to be driving with a blood alcohol content of 0.053%, however he too remained on the bench.

Born in Islington, Merington was the daughter of Margaret and Richard Whiskin Merington, her father being a deputy principal at the Bank of England. She continued to live with her parents into her forties, and became involved in the movement for women to take up elected public posts. In 1872, she joined the Chelsea divisional committee of the London School Board, the committee focusing on encouraging school attendance. Other members of the committee included Emily Shirreff and Mary Anne Donkin. Throwing herself into education, Merington became the manager of three schools in Notting Hill, and also established creches for the babies of working women. Merington stood for the Kensington Board of Guardians in 1875. Unusually, her candidacy was accepted, and she went to the poll. She received 3,893 votes, which saw her elected as the last of eighteen representatives. She was the first woman to serve as a Poor Law Guardian, and was very active in her duties. She served on a local relief committee, as a visitor to the local workhouse and its infirmary, and six months later joined a new committee which visited local schools and asylums. She also produced a report criticising conditions at a school in Herne Bay, where some Kensington children had been sent, and reorganised the staffing of the workhouse infirmary, producing significant savings. Merington stood again in the 1877 elections, and received an improved vote, taking the twelfth of the eighteen seats. Thereafter, she rarely attended board meetings, but continued as a very active visitor to the schools and infirmary. She again faced re-election in 1879, but was moving house on election day. One local ratepayer challenged her election, claiming that she was ineligible as she did not technically meet the property requirements on the day of election, and the court disqualified her. Merington supported women standing in the 1879 London School Board elections, and offered advice on how the board should run Upton House, its school for truants. She did not re-enter public life, but later became a private language tutor, living in Croydon and then in Wimbledon, where she died in 1912.

History  Share certificate of the Halberstadt-Blankenburger Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft of 1 May 1870 Construction for the first section of the Halberstadt-Blankenburg Railway (Halberstadt-Blankenburger Eisenbahn, HBE) started on 28 July 1870 and the line was opened on 31 March 1873. A siding to the Blankenburg iron works, which was about 3 km-long, was opened on 12 July 1875. Since the operation as a main line incurred large operating expenses, the line was reclassified as a branch line in 1877. This allowed, among other things, numerous guards to be saved at level crossings.  Operations  = Freight operations = Freight traffic operates to the lime works over the Rübeland Railway. Until the power was removed from the Rübeland Railway’s overhead line in 2005, haulage of traffic in Blankenburg was changed from electric to Diesel locomotives, mostly of class 232 or class 241. These locomotives then took over the haulage to Halberstadt. To avoid the need to reverse in Blankenburg, a bypass curve exists north of the station. = Passenger services = Passenger services run on the line every hour. After 1989, class 202 locomotives were often used for hauling passenger trains. From 2000, passenger trains from Halberstadt connected with services to Elbingerode on the Rübeland Railway, which ended in 2005.

The town has a population (2017) of 2,503 which gives the town a population density of . The Tvedestrand Church is located in the central part of the town. History Tvedestrand had been a small coastal village with a small amount of industry when it became the main port of departure for the materials from the nearby Næs Jernverk (iron works) starting in 1738. In 1836, the port was declared to be a ladested and then on 1 January 1838, it became a town municipality under the new civil municipality law (see formannskapsdistrikt). The town status was granted to allow it a special license to export timber and iron from the harbour. On 1 January 1858, there was a boundary adjustment that added 70 more residents to the town of Tvedestrand from the municipality of Holt. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1960, the neighboring municipalities of Dypvåg (population: 1,805) and Holt (population: 3,759) were merged with the town of Tvedestrand (population: 868) to form a new municipality called Tvedestrand. Due to the merger, however, Tvedestrand lost its town status. A new law was passed in 1996 that allowed municipalities to declare urban areas as towns once again. In 1997, the municipality approved the town status for the former town of Tvedestrand.

Definition  The first known use of the term domestic violence in a modern context, meaning violence in the home, was in an address to the Parliament of the United Kingdom by Jack Ashley in 1973.National Women's Aid Federation .House of Commons Sitting (1973) Battered Women. The term previously referred primarily to civil unrest, violence from within a country as opposed to violence perpetrated by a foreign power.  Prevalence  According to the Office of National Statistics (ONS) about 4.2% of men and 7.9% of women suffered domestic abuse in England and Wales during 2018. This equates to about 685,000 male victims and 1,300,000 women. Murders related to domestic violence are at a five year high. The majority of victims are women and the majority of suspects are men. Domestic abuse campaigner, Jess Phillips MP, maintains the government focused too much on criminal justice, while cutting police resources and refuge beds were reduced.Domestic violence murders reach five-year high BBC One in four women and one in six men will be affected by domestic abuse during their lives. On average 2 women are murdered every week and 30 men are murdered every year due to domestic violence. 16% of violent crime is domestic abuse though domestic abuse is least likely to be reported to the police. There are more repeat victims of domestic abuse than repeat victims of any other crime. On average domestic abuse victims will have been assaulted 68 times before reporting it to the police. Domestic abuse is the single most quoted reason a person becomes homeless.Statistics Domestic abuse also affects older people. Age UK provided figures showing 200,000 people aged 60 to 74 experienced domestic abuse in England and Wales during one year, Unrecorded abuse could mean the actual figures are higher. People over 74 were not included in the figures. Caroline Abrahams of Age UK said, “There’s a widespread misconception that domestic abuse only happens to younger people but sadly hundreds of thousands of older people are affected, too. barriers [to asking for help or to leaving an abusive relationship] can be severe for survivors who have been subject to years of prolonged abuse, are isolated within a particular community through language or culture, are experiencing long-term health impacts or disabilities, or those who are reliant on their abuser for their care or money.”Action needed to tackle domestic abuse of over-60s, says Age UK The Guardian  Legislation  The Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004 (c 28) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It applies to England & Wales, Northern Ireland in part, but not to Scotland. It is concerned with criminal justice and concentrates upon legal protection and assistance to victims of crime, particularly domestic violence. It also expands the provision for trials without a jury, brings in new rules for trials for causing the death of a child or vulnerable adult, and permits bailiffs to use force to enter homes.The Guardian, 2 June 2009, The poorest need shielding from bailiffs In 2017 it was reported that the Office for National Statistics's research findings suggested that over 10% of 16-19-year- old women are affected by the issue each year.  Funding  Government plans to cut funding for women's refuges could make it harder for women and children to escape domestic violence. 2,000 women a year could be affected. 60% of referrals to refuges were turned away in 2016-17 and funding cuts could make the situation worse.Survey reveals impact of proposed funding cuts on women fleeing abuse The Guardian Other vulnerable groups will have to compete for funding with refuges against domestic violence and women fleeing domestic violence may be subject to a postcode lottery over whether they can escape or not.Funding change could see domestic violence refuges shut BBC Women fleeing domestic violence are frequently put into grossly unsuitable housing, housing where a toilet leaks and housing overrun with mice are examples. This creates a risk that women will return to the abuser. Other very vulnerable women fleeing domestic abuse are forced to sleep rough.Thousands fleeing domestic violence face squalid housing The Guardian Changes to legal aid meant 3234 victims had to face their abuser in court without legal support during the first 9 months of 2017, this contrasts with 1309 victims in the first 9 months of 2012.Number of domestic violence victims without legal help soars The Guardian Katie Ghose of Women’s Aid said, “We know that the cross-examination of victims in the family courts by their abusive former partner is far too common. (...) It is a matter of urgency that the government prioritises the implementation of the ban on this abhorrent practice, be it through the courts bill or the domestic violence and abuse bill. Survivors must be able to safely access justice in both the criminal and family courts in their escape from domestic abuse.”Rudd urged to prevent cross-examining by domestic abusers The Guardian 65% of Local Authorities have cut real terms funding for women's refuges in England, Wales and Scotland since 2010. The government plans to make victims of domestic abuse compete with other vulnerable groups for funding for temporary housing. Women fleeing domestic violence will not be eligible for housing benefit; instead there will be limited funding to provide for domestic violence victims, drug addicts, former offenders and homeless people.Council funding for women's refuges cut by nearly £7m since 2010 The Guardian Women's assets are taken into account in deciding if they qualify for legal aid. Frequently women cannot access their assets because the assets are controlled by the abuser. This prevents women getting protection from the courts. Mark Groves of the National Centre for Domestic Violence said, \\"While many people think Legal Aid is free, it is not, you have to pay a means-tested contribution. Economic abuse victims who don't control their money may not have this [and] those who have fled the family home may not have the right documentation. If you own a house, you have to put down a cash deposit equal to the equity in that house, which could be hundreds of thousands.\\"Legal costs halt thousands of domestic violence cases BBC Some men have repeatedly killed female partners. In the case of Theodore Johnson, convicted of murder in January 2018 and eventually jailed for a minimum of 30 years, The original minimum tariff was for 26 years. he was found guilty of manslaughter on two previous occasions because of his mental health. Such cases are seen as evidence that violence by men against women is not treated seriously by the authorities. Some people accused of domestic violence intimidate their victims into not appearing in court, then the case against them is dropped. A report, from the police and Northumbria crime commissioner, Dame Vera Baird QC, monitored over 220 cases. It suggests cases where the complainant fails to appear are too easily dismissed and criminal justice services need more resources.Defendants 'gaming system' to get domestic violence cases dropped The Guardian  Groups  Immigrants are especially vulnerable to domestic violence. Since 2012 under the hostile environment policy immigrants who are victims of domestic abuse are increasingly deported. The Guardian wrote, \\"The refusal rate for applications under the domestic violence rule rose from 12% in 2012 to 30% in 2016, the last year for which full-year data was available. The figures show that 1,325 people were refused out of a total of 5,820 applications made between 2012 and 2016.\\" Abuse victims may be deported based on what the abuser states without their case being heard.Abuse victims increasingly denied right to stay in UK The Guardian In Scotland there is an initiative to reduce domestic violence called the 'Equally Safe Strategy'. This involves early intervention in domestic abuse cases affecting women, girls and children. The Caledonian Programme dealing with men convicted of crimes involving domestic abuse will be expanded to help reduce re-offending and the 'Rape Crisis Sexual Violence Prevention Programme' will also be introduced in more schools. A rape and sexual abuse support service in England and Wales is also receiving a boost.Domestic abuse action plan to be extended in Scotland The Independent Most refuges do not have disabled access though disabled women are more likely to experience domestic abuse than able bodied women. One in ten refuge places is accessible to domestic violence victims with physical disabilities. Out of 131 councils 20 had no accessible places at all. 16.8% of women with chronic sickness or disability suffer domestic abuse compared to 6.3% of able bodied women. Domestic abuse can involve physical, sexual or emotional abuse, also not providing care from people with long lasting sickness or disability. Council funding for women's refuges overall fell by 6% over the five years to 2018 data from 144 out of 210 UK councils contacted reveals. The largest reduction in spending on domestic violence refuges was from Southampton City Council, which cut spending by 65% since 2013/4.Why disabled women can't access all refuges BBC Women charities in the UK have complained of domestic violence victims being subjected to racism, by being refused places for refuge on the basis of the language they speak. Victims were said to be refused for not speaking English. The charities reported that out of the 20 victims, 5 were rejected by refuges for not speaking the English language.  Resources  The National Domestic Abuse Helpline (telephone number 0808-2000-247) from Refuge gives support, help and information about domestic violence.

Correctional facilities in Norway focus on the care of the offender and making sure they can become a functioning member of society again. Norway has one of the lowest recidivism rates in the world, currently 20% within 2 years,, with approximately 3,933 offenders in prison, and one of the lowest crime rates in the world. Norway's prisons are renowned for being some of the best and most humane in the world. Norway does not have the death penalty or sentence people to life imprisonment. The maximum custodial sentence is 21 years; however, the courts do have the power to add more years to the inmate's sentence as they see fit during his/her sentence if they do not feel that the inmate has been fully rehabilitated.  History  Prior to the introduction of the restorative justice system, Norway had a punitive justice system. In 1968 Norway's people were unsatisfied with the harsh living conditions of the correctional system and the Norwegian Association for Criminal Reform (KROM) was formed. KROM attacked the penal system which depended on medical treatment of offenders. The offender was treated medically and, depending on the success of the treatment, they were incarcerated for an appropriate term. In 1970 the first act was to abolish forced labor systems. By 1975 juvenile delinquency centers were abolished. The penal model was a failure, with a recidivism rate of 91 percent. According to the creators of it at that time recidivism was not the problem, and their goal, to abolish juvenile delinquency centers and forced labor camps, was completed therefore making their first movements successful. At the time this system helped to pioneer the way for a new way of treating offenders. KROM remained active.  Prison population  According to the World Prison Brief website, Norway has 3,933 people within their 54 different institutions as of January 2017. Of those 3,933 people that are inside the prison, 23% are remand prisoners or awaiting their pretrial. There are only 0.1% juveniles within their correctional system. There is also only about 6% of females within the prisons which makes the male percentage 94%. Of the total prison population in Norway, a little more than 30% are foreign-born, rather than Norwegian natives. The official capacity that Norway can hold inside of their prisons is 4,092 people which means that their institutions aren’t over capacity yet. They still have plenty of space to put people that they find guilty of committing a crime. However, the number of people that are being locked up has been increasing in the last decade or so. As of the year 2000, there were about 2,500 people locked up inside of the correctional facilities in Norway. In 2008, there were just below 3,400 people locked up and in 2016, there were 3,850 people that were locked up. The prison population rate jumped from 57 per 100,000 people in 2000 to 73 per 100,000 people in 2016. Although this may not be the highest jump, it still shows that there is an increase of incarcerated people in Norway.Norway.(1 January 1970). Retrieved 8 February 2018, from http://www.prisonstudies.org/country/norway  Restorative justice in Norway  Norway has one of the lowest incarceration and recidivism rates of the world, their method is so effective that other countries use the “Norwegian model”. Norway prefers to use alternative penalties, also known as “penalties in society”, but \\"penalties in prison\\" are still used. = Penalties in society = Penalties in society means, that the offender will serve their time out of jail, they will have to meet with an official a specified number of times as per ordered by the court. In return then can stay out of prison if they follow the order by the court, in most cases they retain their current employment, or the court orders employment, they get to continue being with their families (children, spouses, etc.), they can often continue their normal life but without crime. Penalties in society only are put in place if there is no burden to be put on the victims, their families or society as a result. Community service is the most common penalty in society, it is measured in hours not days, months or years. Approximately 2500 people are sentenced this form of punishment a year and the hours can range from a minimum of 30 to maximum of 70, the average number given to an individual is usually around 70 hours and they should be completed in under a year. The community service is usually spent in social work, the individual spends their time in churches, schools, kindergartens, volunteer organizations and social organizations. Community service may include “change programs”, treatment, special conversations and other programs that may be included with the crime. The correctional system has a right to add other conditions like prohibition of drug or alcohol use, outside of the court orders. The correctional system will draw up a “implementation plan” under the guidelines of the court order, then they can add programs or conditions as they see fit for the crime committed and the individual. This plan should include all aspects of the community service, other sanctions, and other programs with timing, location and people involved. Electronic monitoring or electronic control is one of the most popular methods of penalties in society. It is an electronic ankle GPS that must be worn at all times, it monitors the individual, it can only be used the last four months of probation or imprisonment and the individual qualifies to wear one. While wearing one it cannot be removed and if it is an alarm is triggered, the individual can only go home, work, school or permitted areas (education or job training). Anti- doping programs are court ordered alternative program that would otherwise be unconditionally imprisoned. The crimes are driving under the influence of alcohol, illegal and legal drugs. The goal is to give awareness of the crime and the dangers of what could have happened. This program is only for the offender not for the general public. Drug program with judicial review (ND) is an alternative to unconditional imprisonment for drug and alcohol addicts. The crimes that can get the offender into this program is anything drug related, including crimes to fund the addiction if the crime can be rooted to the drug addiction it can land them into the program. The judge has to issue the alternative, the criminal has to agree they want to get clean, the correctional institution has to agree, and a personal survey has to be completed by the correctional authority. After the prosecutor files all of the claims and they are accepted there will be a two to five-year program controlled by the court. Once the program is implemented there are four stages: implementation, stabilization, liability and continuum. Throughout the program the program will work with correctional services, municipal services, education services, mental health services and specialist health services. Throughout each stage and preset markers, the individual must meet with the court to check progress, and after the program the Freedom Care Authority can check on them after the implementation. In order for the program to be completed all the stages must be completed and the program must be completed during the allotted time. = Penalty in prison = There are currently 43 prisons in Norway, five of which are strictly female, and all prisons are driven by the “import model”, the import model means services are given to inmates just as they are given to those not incarcerated i.e., health services, education, access to library, etc. The longest sentence allowed in a Norwegian prison is 21 years, although the new penal code allows for a 30-year maximum sentence for crimes related to genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes, while the average sentence is about 8 months long. The punishment used in the correctional system is the restriction of liberty, no other rights are taken away from the individuals. Because of this belief, an offender inside a prison will have the same rights as an ordinary citizen. They will try to place offenders in the lowest security area when possible because they believe that if a system is more institutionalized it makes it harder for the offender to successfully return to the community. Therefore, someone will proceed towards release starting from high security prisons, then moving to a lower security prison, then through a halfway house, and eventually released into the community.About the Norwegian Correctional Service.

Retrieved 17 February 2018, from https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35813470 Inmates have their cells searched once a day and are granted very few pre-approved personal items. Urine samples will be collected if needed, usually targeted at random within the population of inmates who have a known history of drug addiction.Shammas, V. L. (2014). The pains of freedom: Assessing the ambiguity of Scandinavian penal exceptionalism on Norway’s Prison Island. Punishment & Society, 16(1), 104-123. The majority of Norwegian prisons (sixty percent) are a closed prison. Open prisons only lock inmates in their cells, houses or rooms at night, the prison campus is open but inmates still cannot leave. Calls are intercepted but phone use is permitted. Open prisons encourage contact with the community, through safe means i.e., visitation, exit, and other adaptations. Transitional housing is used when part of a sentence is completed, the prisoners are still in the prison system but control over them is less strict. Transfer to transitional housing has to be pre-approved for the safety of the community. Transitional housing gradually returns inmates to society with social training and professional training. It sets up an inmate with a network to use once they are released back into society.

Her father, Kazimierz Kuratowski, was a mathematician who worked at the Warsaw School of Mathematics. Kuratowska took part in the Warsaw Uprising during World War II. After the war ended, she graduated from the Medical University of Warsaw with a specialty in hematology, and became a doctor. In the 1980s she joined the Solidarity movement and became one of their healthcare workers. During her time in Solidarity, she took care of over 1,000 political prisoners, and published underground magazines emphasizing their lack of care and inadequate living conditions. During the HIV/AIDS epidemic throughout the 1980s, the government turned to Kuratowska, working with her to prevent the spread of the virus despite having blacklisted her earlier in the decade due to her Solidarity activism. In 1989, she took part in the Polish Round Table Agreement, and from there ran for the Senate in the first democratic elections. She won with 82.5 percent of the vote, the largest margin of any candidate, which she accomplished by saying that she \\"could not promise anything.\\" In her first term, she was chosen to be Deputy Marshal of the Senate. During this time, she also ran the Hematology Clinic at the Warsaw School of Medicine. Kuratowska was re-elected to the Senate in 1991 in 1993, serving as Deputy Marshal again during her third term. She served on the Committee on Social Affairs and Health and the Foreign Affairs Committee. After her term ended in 1997, she was nominated to be the ambassador to South Africa, where she spent the rest of her life, dying in 1999.

Politics  At the 1885 UK general election, William was elected as a Liberal Party Member of Parliament, and while Maud remained a staunch Conservative Party supporter, she gradually won William to her views, as he first joined the Liberal Unionist Party split, then later became associated with the far right of the Conservative Party. From 1905, William held various senior posts in South Africa, and Maud moved with him, associating herself with various local charities. They returned to the UK in 1910, and she became president of the Conservative and Unionist Women's Franchise Association. In this role, she toured the country, speaking in support of women's suffrage. While she initially only supported votes for wealthy single women, she later also supported the enfranchisement of married women, arguing that most married women were conservative. She stood down in 1913, and once World War I started, focused instead on promoting patriotism. After the end of the war, the countess was less active, but became a Justice of the Peace in Hampshire, and served as president of the National Council of Women of Great Britain & Ireland in 1920/21.

It can also refer to carved humanoid figures, the taotao, made of wood, stone, or ivory, that represent these spirits. Anito (a term predominantly used in Luzon) is also sometimes known as diwata in certain ethnic groups (esp. the Visayans) – a Sanskrit derivation loaned from the Indosphere western parts of the Malay archipelago. Pag-anito refers to a séance, often accompanied by other rituals or celebrations, in which a shaman (Visayan: babaylan, Tagalog: katalonan) acts as a medium to communicate directly with the spirits. When a nature spirit or deity is specifically involved, the ritual is called pagdiwata. The act of worship or a religious sacrifice to a spirit is also sometimes simply referred to as anito. The belief in anito are sometimes referred to as Anitism in scholarly literature (Spanish: anitismo or anitería). Spirits Ancient Filipinos were animistic. They believed that everything has a spirit, from rocks and trees to animals and humans to natural phenomena. These spirits are collectively known as anito, derived from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *qanitu and Proto-Austronesian *qaNiCu (\\"spirit of the dead\\"). Cognates in other Austronesian cultures include the Micronesian aniti, Malaysian and Indonesian hantu or antu, Nage nitu, and Polynesian aitu and atua. As well as Tao anito, Taivoan alid, Seediq and Atayal utux, Bunun hanitu or hanidu, and Tsou hicu among Taiwanese aborigines. Anito can be divided into two main categories: the ancestor spirits (ninunò), and deities and nature spirits (diwata). =Ancestor spirits= The Neolithic Manunggul burial jar from the Tabon Caves, Palawan, depicts a soul and a psychopomp journeying to the spirit world in a boat (c. 890–710 BCE) The ninunò (lit. \\"ancestor\\") can be the spirits of actual ancestors or generalized guardian spirits of a family. Ancient Filipinos believed that upon death, the soul (Visayan: kalag; Tagalog: kaluluwa)Among most Filipino ethnic groups, a person is believed to be composed of at least two souls – the breath of life, will, or awareness (ginhawa or hininga, which stays with the living body) and the astral soul (which can travel to the spirit world). Kalag and kaluluwa refer to the latter. The concept of soul dualism is sometimes referred to as \\"twin souls\\" or \\"double souls\\" and is a common belief in Austronesian cultures and other shamanistic cultures. Other names for the astral soul include kaluha, dungan (Visayan); kalag (Bicol); linnawa (Igorot), kaduwa (Isneg), ab-abiik (Kankanaey), karurua (Ilocano), ikaruruwa (Ibanag), karaduwa (Mangyan), kiyaraluwa (Tagbanwa), makatu (Bukidnon), and kadengan-dengan or gimokud (Manobo). (Scott, 1994; Tan, 2008; Mercado, 1991) Most of the terms for the astral soul literally translate to \\"twin\\" or \\"double\\", from PAN *duSa, \\"two\\". (Yu, 2000; Blust, 2010) of a person travels to a spirit world, usually by boat. Manang carved images of household guardian spirits from the Mandaya people There can be multiple locations in the spirit world, varying in different ethnic groups.Compare with the Greek underworld Which place souls end up in depends on how they died, the age at death, or the conduct of the person when they were alive. There was no concept of heaven or hell prior to the introduction of Christianity and Islam;After Spanish contact, various spirit worlds were syncretized into the Christian concept of heaven and hell in dictionaries and Bible translations. They struggled in determining which terminology to use because of the absence of the heaven and hell dichotomy in the Filipino concept of the spirit world. Spanish missionaries and European authors usually equated heaven with maca and calualhatian; and hell with casan (also casanaan, casauaan, or catanaan; sometimes misread as kasamaan). However, in the Boxer Codex maca and casan were synonyms for the Visayan and Tagalog underworlds. The 1754 version of Vocabulario de la lengua tagala used casanaan for both heaven and hell; with casanaan nang hirap as hell, and casanaan nang tova as heaven. Calualhatian (modern spelling: kaluwalhatian) was simply a region in the Tagalog spirit world that souls can enter by crossing a torrential river on a narrow plank. (Rath, 2013) rather, the spirit world is usually depicted as an otherworld that exists alongside the material world. Souls reunite with deceased relatives in the spirit world and lead normal lives in the spirit world as they did in the material world. In some cases, the souls of evil people undergo penance and cleansing before they are granted entrance into a particular spirit realm. Souls would eventually reincarnate after a period of time in the spirit world. Souls in the spirit world still retain a degree of influence in the material world, and vice versa. Pag-anito may be used to invoke good ancestor spirits for protection, intercession (kalara or kalda), or advice. Ancestor spirits that become intercessors with deities are known as pintakasi or pitulon. Vengeful spirits of the dead can manifest as apparitions or ghosts (mantiw)Also mua, mamaw, mamanhig, pamahoy, mamamahoy (McCoy, 1982); later multo. from Spanish muerto, \\"dead person\\" (Tan, 2008) and cause harm to living people. Pag-anito can be used to appease or banish them. Ancestor spirits also figured prominently during illness or death, as they were believed to be the ones who call the soul to the spirit world, guide the soul (a psychopomp), or meet the soul upon arrival. Ancestor spirits are also known as kalading among the Igorot; tonong among the Maguindanao and Maranao; umboh among the Sama-Bajau; nunò or umalagad among Tagalogs and Visayans; nonò among Bicolanos; umagad or umayad among the Manobo; and tiladmanin among the Tagbanwa. =Nature spirits and deities= A golden anito figurine of the Igorot people, from the mines of Suyoc, Mankayan, Benguet (1909) Spirits that have never been human are differentiated in some ethnic groups as diwata. These spirits can range from simple spirits like the diwata of a particular inanimate object, plant, animal, or place,e.g. Nuno sa punso, a dwarf-like anito that lives in anthills; and Dayang Masalanta, the Tagalog diwata of Mount Makiling to deities who personify abstract concepts and natural phenomena,e.g. Mayari, the Tagalog goddess of the moon; Barangaw, the Visayan god of rainbows; and Makapatag, the Visayan god of vengeance to deities who are part of an actual pantheon.e.g. Bathala, the chief deity of the Tagalogs; Magbabaya, the supreme creator of the Lumad people; and Pilandok, trickster spirit of the Maranao They are also known as dewatu, divata, duwata, ruwata, dewa, dwata, diya, etc., in various Philippine languages; all of which are derived from Sanskrit devata (देवता) or devá (देव), meaning \\"deity\\". These names are the result of syncretization with Hindu-Buddhist beliefs due to the indirect cultural exchange (via Srivijaya and Majapahit) between the Philippines and South Asia. However, what entities are considered diwata varies by ethnic group. In some ethnic groups like the B'laan, Cuyonon Visayans, and the Tagalog, Diwata refers to the supreme being in their pantheon,Tagalogs differentiated between Diwata, the universal supreme being, and Bathala, the supreme deity exclusive to them (Hislop, 1971) in which case there are different terms for non-human spirits. Like in ancestor spirits, diwata are referred to in polite kinship titles when addressed directly, like apo (\\"elder\\") or nuno (\\"grandparent\\").The most widespread names for these spirits in various Philippine ethnic groups are diwata or anito. Other names of diwata or specific types of diwata include fieu awas, kahoynon (B'laan); mahomanay, tahamaling (Bagobo); panya'en (Batak); tawong lipod, magindara (Bikol); magtitima, tawo sa talonan (Bukidnon); aled (Gaddang); annani (Ibanag); bakayauwan, monduntug, palasekan, pili, pinading (Ifugao); mangmangkit, katataoan/katawtaw-an, kibaan, litao (Ilocano); apdel, sasailo (Itneg); tumungaw (Kankana-ey); laman labuad, manglilili (Kapampangan); kama- kama/kamakaon (Karay-a); tuglinsau, tagbusau, mandangum (Mandaya); andagaw (Mangyan); tawagenen, manaog (Manobo); karibang (Maranao); kaybaan (Pangasinan); kamanan-daplak (Sambal); dayamdam, piritay (Tagalog); tawo sa talonan (Tagbanwa); lewenri, bawa, katao/kataw, tumawo/tamawo, tawong lupa (Visayan); and guban-on, digkusanon, dalaketnon (Waray). There are three general types of non-human spirits. The first are the environmental or nature spirits \\"bound\\" to a particular location or natural phenomenon (similar to genii loci). They \\"own\\" places and concepts like agricultural fields, forests, cliffs, seas, winds, lightning, or realms in the spirit world. Some were also \\"keepers\\" or totems of various animals and plants. They have inhuman and abstract qualities, reflecting their particular dominions. They do not normally appear in human form and are usually gender-less or androgynous. They rarely concern themselves with human affairs. Rituals involving these spirits are almost always conducted outdoors. The second type of spirits are the \\"unbound\\" spirits which have independent existence. They appear in animal (usually as birds) or human-like forms, have gender differentiation, and have personal names. They are most similar to the fairies of European folklore.With strong parallels to human-like beings like elves and aos sí, as well as diminutive human-like beings like brownies and pixies. (Buenconsejo, 2002) These are the most common types of spirits to become abyan (spirit guides of babaylan), as they are the most \\"sociable\\" and can take interest in human activities. These spirits are usually referred to as engkanto (from Spanish encanto) in modern Filipino folklore. Unlike the \\"bound\\" spirits, these spirits can be invited into human households, and their rituals can take place both outdoors and indoors. Ato, a fertility god of the Bontoc people The last is a class of malevolent spirits or demons, as well as supernatural beings, generally collectively known as aswang, yawa, or mangalos (also mangalok, mangangalek, or magalos) among Tagalogs and Visayans. There are numerous kinds of aswang with specific abilities, behavior, or appearance. Examples include sigbin, wakwak, tiyanak, and manananggal. The first two categories of diwata can also be malevolent, what sets the third category apart is that they can not be appealed to with offerings and they are utterly pitiless. Most practices associated with them is to ward them off, banish them, or destroy them. They are never addressed nor worshiped in religious rituals. Diwata are rarely spoken about openly for fear of attracting their attention. Instead they are referred to with euphemisms like \\"those unlike us\\" (Visayan: dili ingon nato) or various names, like banwaanon or taga-banwa,Not to be confused with the Tagbanwa and Mamanwa ethnic groups, all derived from PAN *banua, \\"home\\" or \\"homeland\\". In modern Filipino languages, banwa has been supplanted by Spanish lugar, thus taglugar is used in place of tagabanwa (Hislop, 1971; Tan, 2008). that translate literally to \\"dweller of a place\\". Among Tagalogs, non-human nature spirits are also euphemistically referred to as lamanglupa (\\"[dwellers of] the bowels of the earth\\") or lamangdagat (\\"[dwellers of] the depths of the sea\\"), depending on their domain. Diwata exist in both the material world and the spirit world. They can be formless or have a material body. They can also take over a body through spirit possession (Visayan: hola, hulak, tagdug, or saob; Tagalog: sanib), an ability essential for the séances in pag-anito. They are believed to be capable of shapeshifting (baliw or baylo), becoming invisible, or creating visions or illusions (anino or landung, lit. \\"shadow\\"). Their powers, however, are limited to their particular domain. A diwata of a forest, for instance, has no dominion over the sea. Most are generally benevolent or capriciously neutral, although they can cause misfortunes and illnesses if angered, disrespected, or mistakenly encountered. Other common characteristics of diwata are that they are perceived as an invisible \\"cold\\" presence (in contrast to \\"warm\\" human spirits); that they leave no footprints (unlike human spirits); and that they sense the world and \\"eat\\" by means of smelling.Diwata can cause harm by \\"eating\\" (smelling) the \\"vital force\\" or \\"breath\\" (ginhawa) of human beings. They are also said to be annoyed by perfume, as well as salt and spices. (Buenconsejo, 2002) Diwata who take human form are said to be pale-skinned and could be distinguished from humans by the absence of a philtrum on the upper lip. Ifugao hogang in the Banaue Rice Terraces, guardian spirits carved from tree fern trunks usually placed along pathways and in village outskirts Diwata are often depicted as appearing to unsuspecting people in human or animal form, sometimes causing unintentional harm. They can also deliberately play tricks on mortals, like seducing or abducting beautiful men and women into the spirit world. Certain places are believed to be owned by diwata or are borders to the spirit world. These are normally avoided or only entered with precautions, especially during twilight when diwata are believed to cross over from the spirit world into the material world. Harm or illness caused by diwata are known as buyag in Visayan and usog in Tagalog. People who were harmed by interactions with diwata are euphemistically described as having been \\"greeted\\" (Visayan: gibati, Tagalog: nabati) or \\"played with\\" (Visayan gidulaan, Tagalog: napaglaruan or nakatuwaan) by diwata. To avoid inadvertently angering a diwata, Filipinos perform a customary pasintabi sa nuno (\\"respectfully apologizing or asking permission from ancestors for passing\\").From sintabi, \\"to respectfully ask permission\\" or \\"to give due respect\\", cf. \\"excuse me\\" This is done by saying the phrases \\"tao po\\" (\\"a human [is passing], elder), \\"tabi po\\" or \\"tabi apo\\" (\\"by your permission, elder\\")In Ilocano, the traditional phrase is \\"bari bari, apo\\", with the same meaning (Tan, 2008) when passing by a place believed to be inhabited by a diwata. Diwata are also believed to be able to mate with humans. People born with congenital disorders (like albinism or syndactyly) or display unusual beauty or behavior are commonly believed by local superstition to be the children of diwata who seduced (or sometimes raped) their mothers. During the Spanish period, diwata were syncretized with elves and fairies in European mythology and folklore, and were given names like duende (goblin or dwarf), encantador or encanto (\\"spell [caster]\\"), hechicero (\\"sorcerer\\"), sirena (\\"mermaid\\"), or maligno (\\"evil [spirit]\\"). In Islamized ethnic groups of the Philippines, these nature spirits are usually called jinn or saitan, due to the influence of Islamic mythology. Religious objects and places =Taotao figures= 15th century bulul with a pamahan (ceremonial bowl) in the Louvre Museum Ancestor spirits were usually represented by carved figures. These were known as taotao (\\"little human\\", also taotaohan, latawo, tinatao, or tatao),From Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *tau, ultimately from Proto-Austronesian *Cau, \\"human\\" or \\"person\\"; compare with Toraja tau tau statues bata-bata (\\"little child\\"), ladaw (\\"image\\" or \\"likeness\\"; also laraw, ladawang, lagdong, or larawan), or likha (\\"creation\\"; also likhak) in most of the Philippines. Other names include bulul (also bulol or bul-ul) or tinagtaggu (also tinattaggu) among the Igorot;Tinagtaggu is a cognate of taotao in the Tuwali language; from tagu, \\"human\\" manaug among the Lumad; and tagno among Bicolanos. Among Tagalogs, taotao were also sometimes referred to as lambana (\\"altar\\" or \\"sacred place\\"),The term lambana was later syncretized with fairies, commonly depicted as tiny winged beings in modern illustrations, even though no similarly winged beings existed in native Filipino folklore (Potet, 2017). Conversely, the alternate term dambana has come to mean \\"shrine\\" or \\"chapel\\" in modern Tagalog after the location in which they are usually kept. Igorot hipag depicting war deities (c. 1900) Taotao were usually austere roughly-carved figures made from wood, stone, or ivory. Some taoatao encountered by the Spanish were made from precious metals or ornamented with gold and jewelry, but these were very rare. Taotao were almost always depicted in the squatting position with the arms crossed over the knees, which is reminiscent of the fetal position, the everyday conversing posture, and the position bodies are arranged during death among Ancient Filipinos. Some figures, however, are depicted standing or doing everyday activities like dancing, pounding rice, or nursing infants. A balaua, a large spirit house used for community rituals to anito among the Itneg people (1922) Most taotao represent an actual deceased person, usually carved by the community upon their funeral. As such, there can be hundreds of taotao in a single village, some of them centuries old. Salako (left) and palaan (right) ceremonial altars among the Itneg people (1922) In very rare cases, diwata can be depicted as taotao in anthropomorphic form, as chimeras or legendary creatures, or as animals. These include a special class of figures called hipag among the Igorot which depict war deities, as well as kinabigat (carved houseposts) and hogang (carved tree fern posts used as boundary markers and as wards against harm). As a rule, however, diwata are not usually depicted as taotao or by any man-made representations. Taotao were not intrinsically sacred. They were representations of the spirits, not the actual spirits themselves. They only became sacred during their use in a pag-anito ritual. Without the spirit they represent, they are treated as mundane carved pieces of wood or sculpted stone. The anonymous author of the 1572 Relación de la conquista de la isla de Luzón describes pag-anito rituals of the Tagalog people as such: > When any chief is ill, he invites his kindred and orders a great meal to be > prepared, consisting of fish, meat, and wine. When the guests are all > assembled and the feast set forth in a few plates on the ground inside the > house, they seat themselves also on the ground to eat. In the midst of the > feast (called manganito or baylán in their tongue), they put the idol called > Batala and certain aged women who are considered as priestesses, and some > aged Indians—neither more nor less. They offer the idol some of the food > which they are eating, and call upon him in their tongue, praying to him for > the health of the sick man for whom the feast is held. The natives of these > islands have no altars nor temples whatsoever. This manganito, or drunken > revel, to give it a better name, usually lasts seven or eight days; and when > it is finished they take the idols and put them in the corners of the house, > and keep them there without showing them any reverence. Regardless, very old taotao handed down through generations are prized as family heirlooms. Among the Igorot, pieces of taotao may also be chipped off and boiled into a medicinal tea. Taotao were commonly kept in corners or small shelves inside houses or granaries. Spanish missionaries recorded that taotao were present in every Filipino household, no matter how poor. When Spanish missionaries arrived in the Philippines, the word \\"anito\\" came to be associated with these physical representations of spirits that featured prominently in pag-anito rituals. During the American rule of the Philippines (1898–1946), the meaning of the Spanish word idolo (\\"a thing worshiped\\") was further conflated with the English word \\"idol\\". Thus in the modern Filipino language, anito has come to refer almost exclusively to the carved taotao figures, instead of the actual spirits themselves. =Shrines, altars, and sacred areas= balete tree in Lazi, Siquijor with a natural spring between its roots Ancient Filipinos and Filipinos who continue to adhere to the indigenous Philippine folk religions generally do not have so-called \\"temples\\" of worship under the context known to foreign cultures.

However, they do have sacred shrines, which are also called as spirit houses. They can range in size from small roofed platforms, to structures similar to a small house (but with no walls), to shrines that look similar to pagodas, especially in the south where early mosques were also modeled in the same way.Madale, N. T. (2003). In Focus: A Look at Philippine Mosques. National Commission for Culture and the Arts. These shrines were known in various indigenous terms, which depend on the ethnic group association.Known as magdantang in Visayan and ulango or simbahan in Tagalog. Among the Itneg, shrines are known tangpap, pangkew, or alalot (for various small roofed altars); and balaua or kalangan (for larger structures). In Mindanao, shrines are known among the Subanen as maligai ; among the Teduray as tenin (only entered by shamans); and among the Bagobo as buis (for those built near roads and villages) and parabunnian (for those built near rice fields).(Kroeber, 1918) They can also be used as places to store taotao and caskets of ancestors. Among Bicolanos, taotao were also kept inside sacred caves called moog.A. L. Kroeber (1918). \\"The History of Philippine Civilization as Reflected in Religious Nomenclature\\".

During certain ceremonies, anito are venerated through temporary altars near sacred places. These were called latangan or lantayan in Visayan and dambana or lambana in Tagalog.Also saloko or palaan (Itneg); sakolong (Bontoc); salagnat (Bicolano); sirayangsang (Tagbanwa); ranga (Teduray); and tambara, tigyama, or balekat (Bagobo) These bamboo or rattan altars are identical in basic construction throughout most of the Philippines. They were either small roof-less platforms or standing poles split at the tip (similar to a tiki torch). They held halved coconut shells, metal plates, or martaban jars as receptacles for offerings. Taotao may sometimes also be placed on these platforms. Other types of sacred places or objects of worship of diwata include the material manifestation of their realms. The most widely venerated were balete trees (also called nonok, nunuk, nonoc, etc.) and anthills or termite mounds (punso). Other examples include mountains, waterfalls, tree groves, reefs, and caves. =Spirit animals= Bakunawa pommel from a Visayan tenegre sword Some animals like crocodiles, snakes, monitor lizards, tokay geckos, and various birds were also venerated as servants or manifestations of diwata, or as powerful spirits themselves. These include legendary creatures like the dragon or serpent Bakunawa, the giant bird Minokawa of the Bagobo, and the colorful Sarimanok of the Maranao. Omen birds were particularly important. The most common omen birds were doves with green or blue iridescent feathers called limokon (usually the common emerald dove, imperial pigeons, or brown doves).Limokon in most of Visayas and among the Lumad; also almúgan (Blaan), alimúkun (Cebuano), alimúkeng (Ilocano); limoken (Maranao); muhen (T'boli); lemuguen (Teduray); and limukun (Subanen) Other omen birds include fairy-bluebirds (tigmamanukan, balan tikis, balatiti, or bathala among Tagalogs; and batala among Kapampangans); kingfishers (salaksak among the Ilocano, Igorot, and Sambal); and flowerpeckers (pitpit, ichaw, ido, or labeg among the Igorot). Rituals and shamans A 1922 photograph of an Itneg shaman making an offering to an apdel, a guardian anito of her village. Apdel are believed to reside in the water-worn stones known as pinaing. Anitism was not a religion about worship. Aside from good ancestor spirits and the few benevolent diwata, most anito were feared, not venerated. To an ordinary person, diwata were regarded as dangerous beings to be avoided or appeased. When interaction was necessary, they performed a ritual known as pag-anito (also mag-anito or anitohan). These are usually directed at ancestor spirits. When the pag-anito ceremony is for a diwata, the ritual is known as pagdiwata (also magdiwata or diwatahan). Minor pag-anito rituals like praying for better weather or banishing minor ill luck can be performed by any householder. However, major pag-anito rituals required the services of the community shaman (Visayan babaylan or baylan; Tagalog katalonan or manganito).Other terms include balyana, paraanito, or paradiwata (Bicolano); balian, balyan, or mabalian (Lumad); balian or tanguilin (Subanen); bawalyan or babaylan (Tagbanwa); beljan (Palaw'an); baglan, mangoodan, or manilao (Ilocano);bahasa (Yakan); dukun, kalamat, or papagan (Sama-Bajau); mandadawak, dawak, insupak, mon-lapu, tumunoh, alpogan, or mumbaki (Igorot); anitu (Aeta); and ma-aram (Karay-a) These shamans were believed to have been \\"chosen\\" by a specific diwata who become their spirit guides.Terms for spirit guides of shamans include bantay, abyan (Visayan); alagad, gabay (Tagalog); abyan, umli, sugujen, or inajew (Lumad); saro (Bicolano); and jinn (Sama-Bajau) This was presumed to happen after they pass the initiation rites of an older shaman they were apprenticed to (usually a relative). In some cases, some shamans acquire their status after they recover from a serious illness or a bout of insanity. In most Filipino ethnic groups, shamans were almost always female. The few males who gain shaman status were usually asog or bayok,Asog is the term used for transvestite male shamans in most of the Visayas and in the Bicol Region. In the rest of Luzon, they are known as bayok (bayoc), bayog, or bayogin (bayoguin or bayoquin). Notably among the Sambal, the highest-ranking shaman was a bayok. They are also known as labia among the Subanen, though they were not necessarily shamans (Kroeber, 1918). There are also similar male shamans who behave as women among the Dayak people of Borneo (Baldick, 2013). Also see Bakla men who dressed as women and lived as women (even marrying men). Itneg people launching spirit boats (taltalabong) bearing offerings for anito (1922) Major pag-anito rituals are centered around a séance. Because of their special relationship with their companion spirits, shamans can act as mediums for other anito, allowing spirits to temporarily possess their bodies. This possession happens after the shaman goes into a trance-like state. This allows the spirit to communicate verbally with the participants as well as physically act out events in the spirit world. At the moment of possession, shamans display a change in behavior and voice. They can sometimes go into seizures and become violent enough that restraints are required. The ritual ends when the spirit leaves and the shaman is awakened. Spirits were invited into the ritual through offerings and sacrifices during and after the ceremonies. These depended on what spirit was being summoned, but offerings are usually a small portion of the harvests, cooked food, wine, gold ornaments, and betel nut. Blood from an animal was also usually part of the offerings, poured directly on the taotao or in a bowl before them. These commonly come from chickens or pigs, but can also be from carabaos or dogs. Salt and spices are usually avoided, as they are believed to be distasteful to anito. There is no record of human sacrifices being offered to anito during the Spanish period of the Philippines, except among the Bagobo people in southern Mindanao where it was prevalent until the early 20th century.Some anthropologists consider the headhunting traditions of the Igorot as a form of human sacrifice. In the funeral rites for celebrated warriors or nobles among Visayans and Tagalogs, favorite slaves may also sometimes be executed and buried (hogot) to accompany the deceased into the spirit world (Scott, 1994; Benedict, 1916) Another common pag-anito ritual throughout most of the Philippine ethnic groups involves the use of spirit boats. These were usually miniature boats laden with offerings set adrift from riverbanks and shorelines. Pag-anito can be conducted on its own or in conjunction with other rituals and celebrations. They can be personal or family rituals or seasonal community events. They can vary considerably between different ethnic groups. The most common pag-anito were entreaties for bountiful harvests, cures for illnesses, victory in battle, prayers for the dead, or blessings. Different ethnic groups had different diwata pantheons and rituals associated with them, though sometimes deities are shared in neighboring ethnic groups. Moreover, different communities also each have their own local patron diwata.In modern Christianized Filipinos, this practice was transferred unto community patron saints and religious icons, which are often celebrated and worshiped in a very similar way (Hislop, 1971), cf. Ati-Atihan, Obando Fertility Rites Historical accounts Historical accounts of anito in Spanish records include the following: A figurine of Lumawig, a cultural hero and the supreme being in the pantheon of the Bontoc people *\\"Most of the Indians are heathens...They believe in their ancestors, and when about to embark upon some enterprise commend themselves to these, asking them for aid.\\" – Francisco de Sande, Relacion de las Yslas Filipinas (1576) *\\"Which treats of the rites and ceremonies observed by the Moros in the vicinity of Manilla, and of their social conditions. The god Batala. According to the religion formerly observed by these Moros, they worshiped a deity called among them Batala, which properly means “God.” They said that they adored this Batala because he was the Lord of all, and had created human beings and villages. They said that this Batala had many agents under him, whom he sent to this world to produce, in behalf of men, what is yielded here. These beings were called anitos, and each anito had a special office. Some of them were for the fields, and some for those who journey by sea; some for those who went to war, and some for diseases. Each anito was therefore named for his office; there was, for instance, the anito of the fields, and the anito of the rain. To these anitos the people offered sacrifices, when they desired anything—to each one according to his office. The mode of sacrifice was like that of the Pintados. They summoned a catalonan, which is the same as the vaylan among the Pintados, that is, a priest. He offered the sacrifice, requesting from the anito whatever the people desired him to ask, and heaping up great quantities of rice, meat, and fish. His invocations lasted until the demon entered his body, when the catalonan fell into a swoon, foaming at the mouth. The Indians sang, drank, and feasted until the catalonan came to himself, and told them the answer that the anito had given to him. If the sacrifice was in behalf of a sick person, they offered many golden chains and ornaments, saying that they were paying a ransom for the sick person’s health. This invocation of the anito continued as long as the sickness lasted.\\" :\\"When the natives were asked why the sacrifices were offered to the anito, and not to the Batala, they answered that the Batala was a great lord, and no one could speak to him. He lived in the sky; but the anito, who was of such a nature that he came down here to talk with men, was to the Batala as a minister, and interceded for them. In some places and especially in the mountain districts, when the father, mother, or other relative dies, the people unite in making a small wooden idol, and preserve it. Accordingly there is a house which contains one hundred or two hundred of these idols. These images also are called anitos; for they say that when people die, they go to serve the Batala. Therefore they make sacrifices to these anitos, offering them food, wine, and gold ornaments; and request them to be intercessors for them before the Batala, whom they regard as God.\\" – Miguel de Loarca, Relacion de las Yslas Filipinas (1582) Small ornate pottery houses used as offerings for rice anito among the Itneg people *\\"They held the cayman in the utmost veneration; and, whenever they made any statement about it, when they descried it in the water, they called it Nono, which means \\"grandfather.\\" They softly and tenderly besought it not to harm them; and to this end offered it a part of what they carried in their boats, casting the offering into the water. There was no old tree to which they did not attribute divinity; and it was a sacrilege to cut such a tree for any purpose. What more did they adore? the very stones, cliffs, and reefs, and the headlands of the shores of the sea or the rivers; and they made some offering when they passed by these, going to the stone or rock, and placing the offering upon it. I saw many times in the river of Manila a rock which for many years was an idol of that wretched people... While sailing along the island of Panai I beheld on the promontory called Nasso, near Potol, plates and other pieces of earthenware, laid upon a rock, the offering of voyagers. In the island of Mindanao between La Canela and the river [i.e., Rio Grande], a great promontory projects from a rugged and steep coast; always at these points there is a heavy sea, making it both difficult and dangerous to double them. When passing by this headland, the natives, as it was so steep, offered their arrows, discharging them with such force that they penetrated the rock itself. This they did as a sacrifice, that a safe passage might be accorded them.\\" – Fr. Pedro Chirino, Relacion de las Islas Filipinas (1604) *\\"They also adored private idols, which each one inherited from his ancestors. The Visayans called them divata, and the Tagálogs anito. Of those idols some had jurisdiction over the mountains and open country, and permission was asked from them to go thither. Others had jurisdiction over the sowed fields, and the fields were commended to them so that they might prove fruitful; and besides the sacrifices they placed articles of food in the fields for the anitos to eat, in order to place them under greater obligations. There was an anito of the sea, to whom they commended their fisheries and navigations; an anito of the house, whose favor they implored whenever an infant was born, and when it was suckled and the breast offered to it. They placed their ancestors, the invocation of whom was the first thing in all their work and dangers, among these anitos. In memory of their ancestors they kept certain very small and very badly made idols of stone, wood, gold, or ivory, called licha or laravan. Among their gods they reckoned also all those who perished by the sword, or who were devoured by crocodiles, as well as those killed by lightning. They thought that the souls of such immediately ascended to the blest abode by means of the rainbow, called by them balañgao. Generally, whoever could succeed in it attributed divinity to his aged father at his death. The aged themselves died in that presumptuous delusion, and during their sickness and at their death guided all their actions with what they imagined a divine gravity and manner. Consequently, they chose as the place for their grave some assigned spot, like one old man who lived on the seacoast between Dulac and Abuyog, which is in the island of Leyte. He ordered himself placed there in his coffin (as was done) in a house standing alone and distant from the settlement, in order that he might be recognized as a god of navigators, who were to commend themselves to him. Another had himself buried in certain lands in the mountains of Antipolo, and through reverence to him no one dared to cultivate those lands (for they feared that he who should do so would die), until an evangelical minister removed that fear from them, and now they cultivate them without harm or fear.\\" – Fr.

The Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection Troops of the Russian Armed Forces () of the Russian Federation are special forces designed to conduct the most complex set of measures aimed at reducing the loss of associations and formations of the Ground Forces and ensuring their combat tasks assigned during operations in conditions of radioactive, chemical and biological contamination, as well as at enhancing their survivability and protection against high-precision and other weapons. The basis of the NBCP Troops is realised by multifunctional separate brigades of NBCP having in their composition subunits capable to perform all activities of NBCP. The main tasks of the NBCP Troops include: * identification and assessment of radiological, chemical and biological environment, scales and effects of damages of objects hazardous radiatively, chemically and biologically; * protection of formations and units against the nuclear effects of mass destruction weapons and radiological, chemical and biological contamination; * reducing the visibility of troops and facilities; * disaster (damage) recovery in objects hazardous radiatively, chemically and biologically; * causing loss to the enemy by using flame-incendiary means. NBC Protection Troops is organised and conducted in corpore both in conduct of hostilities using nuclear, biological and chemical weapons and without them and includes: * nuclear detection; * NBC reconnaissance and control; * collection and processing of data and information on radiological, chemical and biological environment; * notification of troops on NBC contamination; * conducting special treatment (decontamination, degassing and disinfection) of armaments, military and special equipment, buildings and other objects, as well as sanitisation of personnel; * aerosol counteraction against the enemy’s reconnaissance and targeting means. The NBCP Troops are developing as dual- purpose forces, able to solve tasks both in war and peace times, in the aftermath of accidents and disasters in industrial facilities hazardous radiatively, chemically and biologically. Further build-up of their capacity is realized by creating a modern system to identify and assess the extent and effects of weapons of mass destruction, integrated with automated control systems of troops and weapons and stable functioning in the NBC threat environment and strong electronic countermeasures. In addition, there is a process to equip formations, units and subdivisions of NBCP with new, highly effective means of NBC reconnaissance, individual and collective defence, technical means of reducing the visibility and masking, flame-throwing incendiary weapons, as well as to introduce improved materials, formulations, methods and technical means of decontamination.https://www.armyrecognition.com/november_2018_global_defense_security_army_news_industry/russian_ncb_troops_armed_with_new_hardware.html Units RPM-2 – radiological reconnaissance vehicle *1st Mobile NBC Protection Brigade (Shikhany-2, Oblast of Saratov) *16th NBC Protection Brigade (Lesozavodsk) *27th NBC Protection Brigade (Kursk) *28th NBC Protection Brigade (Kamyshin, Volgograd Oblast) *29th NBC Protection Brigade (Yekaterinburg) *2nd NBC Protection Regiment (Samara) *4th NBC Protection Regiment (Sevastopol) *6th NBC Protection Regiment (Sapyornoye, Leningrad Oblast, Priozersky District) *10th NBC Protection Regiment (Topchikha) *19th NBC Protection Regiment (Gorny, Zabaykalsky Krai) *20th NBC Protection Regiment (Tsentralny, Volodarsky District) *25th NBC Protection Regiment (Sergeyevka, Pogranichny District) *26th NBC Protection Regiment (Onokhoy) *35th NBC Protection Regiment (Belogorsk, Amur Oblast) *39th NBC Protection Regiment (Oktyabrsky, Kalachovsky District, Volgograd Oblast) *40th NBC Protection Regiment (Troitskaya, Ingushetia, Republic of Ingushetia) *70th Separate Flamethrower Battalion (Razdolnoye, Primorsky Krai) Videogallery File:Стрельбы из тяжёлой огнемётной системы ТОС-1А «Солнцепёк» на полигоне Лужский.webmTOS-1A Solntsepyok combat firing; 20th NBC Protection Regiment File:ТОС-1А «Солнцепёк» провели боевые стрельбы в Ленинградской области.webmTOS-1A Solntsepyok combat firing; 6th NBC Protection Regiment  See also  * NBC Protection Military Academy * Canadian Joint Incident Response Unit * 2nd Dragoon Regiment (France) * United States Army CBRN School * Chemical Corps  References  External links Russian Ground Forces NBC units and formations ","title":"Russian NBC Protection Troops"},{"id":"55909675","text":"Rachel Payne is a tech entrepreneur. and technology executive.

The Engineer Troops of the Russian Federation () are a military administrative corps of the Ground Forces of the Russian Federation designed to perform military engineering operations (combat actions), requiring special training of personnel and use of means of engineer equipment, as well as for damaging the enemy through application of engineer ammunition. Origins =Imperial era= One of the first engineering units founded in the Russian Empire was the Pososhniye lyudi, a collective name for conscripts in the Imperial Russian Army called up for military service from each sokha unit. In the late 17th century, the first engineering training maneuvers were carried out under the patronage of Peter I. The day of the Engineering Forces is recognized as 21 January 1701, with on the opening of the School of the Pushkar Order. The first engineering schools were created: in 1708 in Moscow and then in March 1719 in St. Petersburg. The term of study at these schools ranged from 5 to 12 years. The Imperial Engineering Troops first took part in the Battle of Poltava, the Patriotic War of 1812, Crimean War from 1853 to 1856, and the First World War.https://viupetra.3dn.ru/publ/13-1-0-23 =Soviet era= After the February Revolution and the Great October Socialist Revolution of 1917 the newly former Red Army and Soviet Navy incorporated the sapper units of the former Imperial Russian Army and Navy in its structure. By 1919, pontoon and electrical battalions and a mine-blasting brigade were raised in time for the Civil War. 10 years later, the Engineering Troops of the USSR () were in much better shape and had a much better organization. During the Second World War, ten sapper armies operated, later reorganized into brigades. From the mid-1940s to the 1970s, Engineer-Sapper Companies (ISR) were located in Soviet Army regiments, divisions, as well as combined-arms armies. Due to miscalculations in planning by the Ministry of Defense of the Soviet Union, there was a shortage of engineering units serving in Afghanistan during the Soviet–Afghan War. In 1986, the Engineering Troops took part in the military response to the biological effects of the Chernobyl accident. After the collapse of the USSR in late 1991, the Engineering Troops were dissolved and its component units were absorbed by Russia as well as the newly formed armed forces of nations such as Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Armenia. Modern history The official holiday of the Engineering Troops was established by decree of President Boris Yeltsin on 18 September 1996. By order of the Minister of Defense on 23 September 1996, it was prescribed to celebrate the Day of Engineering Troops on January 21 annually.https://m.tvzvezda.ru/news/forces/content/2020121458-NLJsS.html Mission In preparation and conduct of combined-arms operations (combat actions) the Engineer Troops perform, among others, the following tasks: * engineer reconnaissance of the enemy, terrain and objects; * construction (arrangement) of fortifications (trenches, ditches and communication trenches, shelters, bunkers, dugouts, etc.) and organization of field deployment of troops (residential, logistical, medical); * organisation of engineering obstacles, including installation of mine fields, production of blasting, organisation of non-explosive obstacles (anti-tank ditches, scarps, counterscarps, stakes, etc.); * clearance of areas and facilities; * preparation and maintenance of traffic routes of troops; * creation and maintenance of ferries across water barriers, including construction of bridges; * extraction and purification of water in the battlefield In addition, they are involved in countering the intelligence systems and homing of the enemy’s weapons (camouflage), simulation of troops and facilities, providing misinformation and demonstrative actions to deceive the enemy as well as to eliminate or reduce the effects of enemy weapons of mass destruction. In peacetime, the Engineer Troops have a number of important and socially significant tasks: they clean areas of explosive hazards, are involved in the response and liquidation of aftermath of man-made accidents and catastrophes, natural disasters, prevent destruction of bridges and waterworks during floating of ice, etc. Further development of the Engineer Troops is carried out through equipping them with qualitatively new, highly effective, versatile means of engineer equipment, built on the basis of standardised elements, blocks and modules, with a simultaneous decrease of the nomenclature samples of the same type for the intended purpose. Organization Organisationally the Engineer Troops are composed of formations, units and subdivisions for various purposes: engineering- reconnaissance, field engineering, fencing, obstacle clearing, assault-and- traffic engineering, pontoon bridge (pontoon), assault-crossing, camouflage- engineering, technology-engineering, field water supplying ones and so on. = Composition = * Directorate of the Commander of the Engineering Troops (Moscow) * 1st Guards Engineer-Sapper Brigade (Murom) * 11th Separate Guards Engineering Brigade (Kamensk-Shakhtinsky) * 12th Separate Guards Engineering Brigade (Ufa) * 14th Separate Guards Engineering Brigade (Vyatskoye, Khabarovsk Krai) * 28th Separate Pontoon Bridge Brigade (Murom) * 6th Engineer Regiment (Rostov)В состав танковой армии ЗВО войдет новый инженерно-саперный полк / mil.ru, 29.01.2018 * 16th Engineer Regiment (Boguchar) * 24th Engineer Regiment (Kyzyl) * 30th Engineer Regiment (Kerro, Vsevolozhsky District) * 31st Engineer Regiment * 32nd Engineer Regiment (Afipsky) * 35th Engineer Regiment (Razdolnoe, Primorsky Krai) * 39th Ebgineer Regiment (Kizner) * 45th Separate Engineer Regiment (Nakhabino) * Training centers  66th Interdepartmental Training Methodological Center of Engineering Troops (Nakhabino)  International Mine Action Center (Nakhabino)  187th Interspecific Regional Training Center for the Engineering Troops (Volzhsky),  210th Guards Interspecific Regional Training Center for the Engineering Troops (Kstovo) * Research institutes  Central Research and Testing Institute of Engineering Troops (Nakhabino) * Orthodox Choir and Engineering Troops Ensemble \\"For Faith and Fatherland\\"Хору инженерных войск «За Веру и Отечество» исполнилось 25 лет / mil.ru, 23.01.2018  Educational institutions  The Tyumen Higher Military Engineering Command School *Military Engineering Academy *Military Institute (Engineering Troops) of the Combined Arms Academy of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation *Military Engineering and Technical University *Tyumen Higher Military Engineering Command School named after Marshal of the Engineering Troops Alexey Proshlyakov  Commanders of the Engineering Troops  Lieutenant General Yuri Stavitsky *Colonel General Vladimir Kuznetsov (1992-1999) *Colonel General Nikolai Serdtsev (1999-2008) *Lieutenant General Yuri Balkhovitin (2008-2009) *Colonel Vladimir Prokopchik (interim) (2009-2010) *Lieutenant General Yuri Stavitsky (since July 2010)Генерал-лейтенант Ю.

Plot  In a 2015 article about the play, Poorva Joshi from the Hindustan Times described it as being \\"Set in the pre-Independence era, in a college campus in Poona (now Pune), it had a seemingly conventional boy-meets-girl build-up. In reality, it was a love triangle between Bapu, a shy boy battling a strong sense of inadequacy, Mitra, an independent girl with a secret that eventually resulted in her downfall, and Nama, Mitra’s graceful-yet-treacherous love interest.\\" According to a 2016 article in Mid-Day, \\"Mitrachi Goshta told the story of a love triangle between three students in a Pune college. Bapu, Mitra, Nama's story is, however, not the regular triangle. When Bapu's wish of getting to know Mitra comes true, he becomes party to her inner struggles with her sexuality, and eventually gets drawn into a game of vacillating sexual politics between she and Nama, the girl she desires.\\" According to Mint, \\"In this love tangle, Bapu is smitten by the seemingly self-possessed Mitra (Phatak), who is sexually attracted to Pethe’s Nama, who reciprocates her feelings. Same-sex desire was little understood in those times and a conflicted Mitra soon launches into a self- destructive trajectory. While she is unwilling to sacrifice her innate desires, she inevitably ends up as an archetypal victim.\\"  Publication  The original Marathi language edition of the play was published in 1982 by Nilkanth Prakashan. An English language translation by Gowri Ramnarayan was published in 2001 by Oxford University Press.

For two millennia, this was organized based on a Confucian understanding of religion and politics, often discussed in terms of Confucian political philosophy. At various points throughout its history, Chinese Buddhism presented an alternative to the political import of Confucianism. However, since the mid-twentieth century, communist understandings of religion have dominated the discourse. For Christianity, this relationship can be seen from the religion's earliest encounters in the country during the imperial period, with the Church of the East's interaction with the Emperor Taizong and Jesuit missionaries in the Ming court. But it has developed the most in the 20th and 21st centuries after the establishments of the Republic of China and People's Republic of China. This is particularly true through the establishment of the Protestant Three-Self Patriotic Movement and the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association, the rise of underground and house churches, and interactions with the secular academy.  Imperial China  The Nestorian Stele, erected in 781, recording interactions between the Church of the East and Emperor Taizong For over two millennia, from the Han dynasty (206 BC – AD 220) until the Qing dynasty (1636–1912), the dominant ideology that was upheld as state orthodoxy was Confucianism. During much of this time, all other religions needed to be registered and administered under the Confucian political system. This would shape the history of the relationship between Christianity and politics in China could be traced to Tang Dynasty (618–907), when scholars believe that Christianity first came to China. Emperor Taizong and his successors of adopted the policy of religious tolerance. They allowed the mission of Church of the East monks and invited them to translate scriptures for the empire. In 845, during the Great Anti- Buddhist Persecution, the Church of the East was misunderstood as a sect of Buddhism and was banned by Emperor Wuzong. In Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368), several Mongol tribes converted to Christianity through the Church of the East. During this time, the Pope of the Roman Catholic Church also sent envoys to the Mongol Empire capital Khanbaliq (present-day Beijing). In Ming Dynasty (1368–1644), Jesuits initiated mission in China. Matteo Ricci would be the most well-known among these missionaries. Jesuits exerted considerable influence at court via the policy of accommodation and converted several senior officials, such as Xu Guangqi. In Qing dynasty (1636–1912), Catholic missionaries still played important roles at court as consultants of emperors. In the 18th century, the Chinese Rites controversy had raised tension between the Vatican and Qing dynasty's Emperors. Emperor Yongzheng was formally against Christian converts among Manchu people and banned the mission again. After the First Opium War (1839–1842), with the aid of several unequal treaties, Christian missionaries were allowed to evangelize in China and continue to import the Western civilization to China. Due to an impression that missionaries were allies with foreign colonial governments, many Chinese became hostile to Christianity. This further influenced the relationship between Christianity and politics. Many anti-missionary riots (Jiao'an), the Boxer Rebellion, and the anti-Christian movement can be considered as the consequences of such relationship.  Republic of China  The 20th century witnessed the emergence of new Chinese political thinkers. The May Fourth movement emphasized a climate of strong political engagement, under the mantra of \\"Mr. Science\\" and \\"Mr. Democracy,\\" and the growing ferment around the national salvation movement. Kang Youwei advocated the idea of a Confucian church as the state religion of China. Taixu would seek to reform Chinese Buddhism, to contribute to the building of Chinese society and politics. Christian leaders like Y. T. Wu, in the face of the anti-Christian movement, appealed to revolutionary theory and constructed a Chinese Christian theology. People's Republic of China  = Protestantism = After 1949, the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese Protestant leaders encountered new challenges – the new regime of the communist government is based on atheistic ideology of Marxism. They had to decide how to deal with the relationship with the atheistic government. There were different attitudes and theologies among Chinese Christians. Some of them, such as Y. T. Wu, who were willing to support the new government, helped to pen the Christian Manifesto and initiated the Three-Self movement (TSPM) in 1950s; they reconstructed theology in terms of cooperation. Others, such as Wang Mingdao, were unwilling to endorse the radical TSPM and refused to support the new government, are regarded as the forerunners of the present-day house church. In the 1950s Denunciation Campaigns, some Christian leaders, such as Wang Mingdao, Watchman Nee, from the opposing camp were arrested and sentenced in the name of counter-revolutionaries. During the ten years of Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), all the religious activities were banned and many Christians met and worshiped in the Christians' houses. In 1980s, religious activities recovered and churches gradually opened. However, Christians who were unwilling to joined the TSPM churches and chose to gather in unregistered house churches which gather in personal houses or apartments. K. H. Ting and Wang Weifan were leaders and representatives of the TSPM church. Wang Mingdao and Wang Yi would be representatives of the house church; the latter Wang is the pastor in the urban church in Chengdu which is not a traditional house church, but who still claims the link to the house church. = Catholicism = In the 1950s, after Zhou Enlai saw the possibilities in Protestantism with the TSPM, a similar approach was taken with Catholicism leading to the formation in 1957 of the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association (CPCA), severing ties with the Vatican. Those who chose not to affiliate with the CPCA and remain loyal to the Pope and the Vatican are often considered part of the underground church. Ignatius Kung Pin-Mei, the Catholic bishop of Shanghai, opposed the formation of the CPCA and, along with several hundred bishops and church leaders, was arrested on 8 September 1955. He viewed the CPCA as being schismatic and, therefore, not in union with the universal Roman Catholic Church. Kung criticized China's lack of religious freedom and reckoned that Chinese Catholics \\"do not have the freedom to worship.\\" When he was interviewed by the Soul Magazine in 1993, Kung expressed his sympathy for the underground Catholics and Bishops under the Communist government and claimed that, \\"The government should understand from history that every time the Church was persecuted, the Church has always survived and grown out of the persecution.\\" Another significant figure was Aloysius Jin Luxian, who was arrested alongside Kung on 8 September 1955. However, after being released from prison in 1982, he took several leadership roles within the CPCA, including becoming founding rector of the Sheshan Seminary and bishop of Shanghai in 1988, without Vatican approval. = Confucianism = Despite the Anti-Confucius developments of the Cultural Revolution, since the 1980s, there has been a restored interest in Confucianism as offering a renewed political ideology for mainland China. Part of this has included the introduction of New Confucianism from Taiwan and North America. Some have advocated for the building of new Confucian churches in the country. Others, such as Jiang Qing have advocated for a new form of constitutional Confucianism. = Academy = Since the late 1980s there has been a growing interest in Christianity among academics in China's secular universities. Often described as Cultural Christians, many of whom are not self-identified Christians, these scholars have been drawn to Christianity as a source for the modernization of China. One of the key figures of this movement, Liu Xiaofeng at Renmin University of China, in the 2000s began to draw on the political theology of Carl Schmitt for engaging the Chinese political arena. Others, such as Xie Zhibin from Tongji University in Shanghai, has attempted to offer a public theological engagement based on the theology of Max Stackhouse. Most recently, Zhuo Xinping of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences has advocated for the sinicization or Chinization () of Christianity both politically and culturally.  Key documents  = The Christian Manifesto = \\"The Christian Manifesto\\" was published in July 1950 and its original title was \\"Direction of Endeavor for Chinese Christianity in the Construction of New China.\\" The founding group of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, including Y. T. Wu, drafted the document in consultation with Premier Zhou Enlai. During the 1950s, 400,000 Protestant Christians publicly endorsed and signed this document. = The 95 Theses of the Chinese Reformed Church = In August 2015 Wang Yi posted a document titled \\"Reaffirming Our Stance on the House Churches: 95 Theses\\" in an attempt to reaffirm the Chinese house church's position in the relationship between government and society. Echoing Martin Luther's 95 theses, these Chinese 95 theses demonstrate his opinion of the church-state relationship from the perspective of the house church.

This theory is also Mao Zedong's remedy to the \\"National Question\\" in Marxist theory. As a subset of the general philosophy of Mao Zedong Thought (Maoism), the theory of national struggle addresses the question of how classical Marxist-Leninist ideas of political economy should intersect with China's particular need for constructing a multi-ethnic national sovereignty without abandoning the universality of Marxism-Leninism. The gist of Mao's theory is that Chinese communists should treat the question of national and ethnic liberation in China as a subset of the larger socialist project of class conflict. In strategic terms, this means that the key to constructing a multiethnic Chinese nation-state is to mobilize and transform \\"backward\\" ethnic minorities into modern subjects of proletariat class consciousness under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Mao's political theory of \\"Nation Struggle\\" works in tandem with his theory of history, \\"New Democracy\\". In formulating the history of Modern China as a series of social, political, economic, and cultural transformations marked by a national process of class awakening reacting against encroachments by Western and Japanese colonial aggressions, Mao argued that a \\"national struggle\\" to restore Chinese sovereignty was the first vital step in constructing a multi-ethnic regime of proletariat dictatorship. In doing so, Mao prioritized the creation of a united front against foreign aggressions as the larger struggle of the Chinese Revolution, one that involves the simultaneous cultivation of a united national identity amongst different ethnic minority groups and the transformation of \\"feudal-minded\\" ethnic minority populations into modern proletariat subjects. The amalgamation of Mao's two separate theories of revolution signified his theoretical departure from the general doctrine of Marxism-Leninism in Soviet Union and in Europe, which strictly held the economic-determinist ideal that base determines superstructure. Mao's theories not only addressed the primacy of nationalism in revolutionary mobilization, but also cast doubts on the classical Marxist notion of historical inevitability because Mao argued that a nationwide class consciousness could not be awaken in China unless cultivated by party leadership. Moreover, by conflating the notions of \\"ethnicity\\" and \\"nationality,\\" Mao justified the CCP's geopolitical claim over the former territories and ethnic minority subjects of the multi-ethnic Qing Empire. Since Mao came to power in the communist establishment during the Yan'an period, Mao's theory of \\"national struggle\\" became the guiding principle of ethnic and national liberation strategy of the Chinese Communist Party until his death in 1976. Background  Origins  = The National Question = One of the greatest theoretical conundrums in Marxism was the contradiction between internationalism and nationalism, the theory and praxis of proletarian revolution. In the original Das Kapital, Marx offered neither a systematic theory of the national question, a precise definition of the construct of the \\"nation,\\" nor a general political strategy for the proletariat to seize state power. Even when Marx did talk about the political implications of the worker's state that he envisioned, his articles on the subject were, for the most part, strictly analytical and rooted in the concrete political cases derived from his historical observations. Due to the ambivalence on statecraft in Marxist theory, Marxist theorists and revolutionaries from different regions and eras generally reinterpreted Marx in order to accommodate local demands for national sovereignty under pressure of global capitalist intervention. In 1920, Lenin theorized that the creation of a national community must start with the unification of the oppressed races and ethnicities to create a worker's state, against the oppressive races and ethnicities of imperialism.列宁，1920，《民族和殖民地问题委员会的报告》 In this process of unification, Lenin argued that the proletariat must lead the revolution by breaking through boundaries of geo-cultural of difference to reach people who were less enlightened, with the ultimate goal of creating a communist society under universal proletariat leadership.列宁，1922，《关于民族或“自治化”问题》 Lenin's approach to the classical \\"National Question\\" in 1920 also included a specific political strategy of liberation with regards to minority ethnicities, in which Lenin claimed that the oppressed races and ethnicities should reserve the right of ethnic-self determination once a universal worker's state is established.列宁，1914，《论民族自决权》 In addition, Lenin argued that the principle of ethnic self-determination could prevent the proletariat from being corrupted by capitalist chauvinists, who would harness cultural difference and nationalism as a tool to divide the oppressed.列宁，1914，《精致的民族主义对工人的腐蚀》 In the later years of Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin would co-opt Lenin's approach to the \\"National Question\\" to advance and legitimize his own theory of \\"socialism in one state.\\" A devout critic of Stalin's \\"socialism in one state\\" theory, Leon Trotsky approached the \\"National Question\\" by combining Lenin's theory of \\"unified and uneven development\\" with his own insights on Marx's concept of \\"permanent revolution.\\" Trotsky saw the Great War in Europe as a product of the contradiction between the productive forces and the restrictive framework of the nation-state, and he argued for the ultimate destruction of the nation- state system altogether once global communism was accomplished. He deemed the \\"National Question\\" as a temporary political form that would eventually diminish through the dialectics of historical development. Under Trotsky, Lenin's theory expanded into a revolutionary strategy which argued that backward countries do not need to pass through the same sequential stages of linear development already achieved by advanced societies. Instead, Trotsky argued that backwards societies and ethnic groups could \\"skip stages\\" of development by having the industrial proletariats from core nations lead the revolution and develop on their behalf. In doing so, Trotsky argued that the global proletariat could permanently prevent a capitalist restoration, advancing an internationalist vision of \\"unequal but simultaneous revolution\\" which fundamentally rejected Stalin's ideological premises. In East Asia, theoretical approaches to the \\"National Question\\" were generally centered around the notions of ethnic development and national identity, since intellectuals in China and Japan constantly sought to redefine what it meant to be \\"modern\\" when their traditional cultural subjectivities were threatened, subverted, and dismembered by the colonial \\"west\\" in the wake of global capitalist intervention. Political scientist Germaine Hoston has recently written about the modification and reception of the \\"National Question\\" as it was transported from Europe and Soviet Union to East Asia by the Comintern. She argues that in Japan and China, the significance of the national question expanded beyond the narrow focus of \\"nationality\\" in European Marxism (namely the attempt by ethnically distinct populations to construct their own national communities in the wake of rising transnational class consciousness) to include issues such as ethnic development, modernization, statecraft, cultural identity, and human agency. Thus, rather than simply being a political question of how to create a worker's state in latecomer societies, the \\"National Question\\" in East Asia evolved into a systematic power discourse which legitimized the absorption of culturally distinct minorities into the nascent multi-ethnic polity of nation-building regimes like the PRC. In China, this metamorphism was generally lead by the CCP under the leadership of Mao Zedong, although other important theorists also participated in the engineering of the theory of \\"National Struggle.\\"  History  Despite the canonization of Maoism in the People's Republic of China, Mao's theory of \\"national struggle\\" was not a monolithic construct that was unaffected by the vicissitudes of time. Neither was Mao the only contributor to China's unique Marxist political theory of ethnic liberation. Historically, Mao's political theory of \\"National Struggle\\" went through several stages of rhetorical and strategic development under the Long March, the Yan'an Rectification Movement, the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese Civil War, and the People's Republic of China. Contemporary scholars of Mao Zedong Thought in the North American academia generally avoid periodizing the history of Maoist philosophy into strict categories of linear development. In the Chinese academia, however, the periodization and categorization of Mao Zedong Thought is encouraged by the state because it helps to establish Mao's theories as ideological doctrine. In general, Chinese scholars identify four to five developmental stages of Mao's National Struggle Theory. = Early development: 1919–1934 = Marxism and the National Question is a short work of Marxist theory written by Joseph Stalin in January 1913 while living in Vienna. The book was reprinted in the USSR in 1934 as part of the book Marxism and the National and Colonial Question. The first phase is the Inchoate Experimental Phase (May 1919 – October 1934). In its early phase, leading Chinese Marxist intellectuals like Li Dazhao and Chen Duxiu focused on the direct application of classical Marxist theory in China, deriving insights from Karl Marx's work \\"On the Jewish Question\\" and Lenin and Stalin's commentary on the \\"National Question.\\" To sum up, Li Dazhao and Chen Duxiu believed that the \\"National Question\\" in China should be subservient to the larger transnational goal of proletarian liberation, blending Lenin's anti-imperialism theory with a vaguely nationalistic drive to create a strong Chinese nation with Marx's ultimate ideal of stateless communism. Less interested in the state's treatment of ethnic minority relationships or the political implications of ethnic liberation, both Li and Chen found Lenin's dichotomy of \\"the oppressed races against the oppressor races\\" a powerful tool which could end the national disunity that perpetuated China's humiliation after the 1919 Versailles treaty and the subsequent Twenty-One Demands from Japan. They argued for both the Comintern and the Chinese Communist Party to harness the momentum of nationalism as a binding social force for proletarian liberation, and urged for the collective self-determination of the \\"Chinese people\\" without considering how such theory could apply to marginal geographies and populations where class dynamism was less apparent. This intellectual trajectory would eventually confront great peril as the Chinese Communist Party was forced to reorganize itself after the 1927 Shanghai Massacre, a notorious event which would later circulate in the CCP's orthodox historiography as a tragic case of class betrayal and state violence initiated by the capitalist Kuomintang (KMT) party. Since the Shanghai coup in 1927 deprived the CCP of its ability to challenge KMT power in urban areas, the need for Chinese communists to reorganize its political power enabled the Moscow-based Comintern to directly intervene in CCP politics. According to the CCP's contemporary reconstructive memories about this period, the CCP since 1927 was plagued by an unfortunate succession of dogmatic leaders who obediently followed the Comintern's instructions by uncritically replicating Soviet policies onto the dissonant socioeconomic reality of China. This orthodoxy maintains that, it was not until Mao's coming to power in the 1935 Zunyi Conference did the Chinese Communist Party finally confront with the errors of dogmatism and rectify its path towards a more systematic strategy of revolution which was complementary to Mao's vision of national struggle. Nevertheless, the CCP leadership during this period espoused the notion that the Chinese approach to ethnic and national liberation must closely observe and corroborate the orthodoxy of the \\"New Philosophy\\" in the Soviet Union, which were later canonized in the Constitution of Chinese Soviet Republic in 1931. KMT troops rounding up Communist prisoners during the 1927 Shanghai Massacre Before his ascension to political leadership in the Chinese Communist Party, Mao Zedong holistically embraced this Soviet ideological orthodoxy as the \\"correct\\" approach to the mobilization of ethnic minorities in China during the period of KMT administration. Corroborating the dominant Soviet thought in the Chinese Communist Party, Mao aligned himself with the Soviet strategy of ethnic liberation which saw the Leninist ethnic self-determination and confederate soviet socialist ethnic-autonomy as possible institutional models that China might follow if Communists might seize the power to create a multi-ethnic nation. However, during the period of ideological dogmatism in the late 1920s and early 1930s, Mao grew increasingly skeptical of the Comintern leadership over the role of peasantry and rural-based nationalism in the Chinese Revolution. Especially after the Manchurian Incident in 1931 when Japan annexed the Chinese Northeast by establishing the puppet state of Manchukuo, Mao and his followers placed themselves in direct opposition to the leadership of the Comintern to articulate a vision of socialism that was grounded on the immediate desire to restore Chinese national sovereignty from foreign colonial powers, deviating from the internationalist strategy of the Comintern. Many of Mao's early writings reflect the growing schism in revolutionary theory. In February 1925, Mao wrote his first piece of ideological literature that directly dealt with the problem of ethnicity and national struggle in China. In his article named \\"the Analysis of Class Structure in Chinese Society (1925),\\" Mao identified two revolutionary groups in Chinese society, the peasants and the National Bourgeoisie, as potential allies of the Chinese proletariat revolution. According to Mao, peasants are the most loyal and easily mobilized subjects of the Chinese revolutionary cause despite their obsession of commodity-exchange and land due to entrenched semi-feudal, petty-bourgeois mentality. On the other hand, National bourgeoisies are only temporary allies of the proletariat because their major interests are capital accumulation, which makes them dedicated to the preservation of national sovereignty and ethnic autonomy but not to the ultimate goal of socialist construction. These embryonic ideas of showed that Mao had already tried to fuse the notion of national and ethnic struggle with the theory of class struggle during the time of Soviet theoretical dominance. = Ideological consolidation: 1934–1937 = The second phase of theoretical development (October 1934 – July 1937) overlapped with the period of Long March, when ideological hostilities toward KMT's political theory of sovereignty coincided with the gradual accession of Maoist leadership within the Chinese Party. During this period of civil warfare, Mao's nascent political power cemented the dominance of his theory within the party leadership, which maintained that the project of restoring national sovereignty must take precedence before a nationwide campaign of class struggle. Overview map of the route of the Long March, 1934–1945. The Long March was a strategic military retreat to evade the continuous military pursuits by the KMT. When Mao ascended to party leadership in the CCP after the 1935 Zunyi Conference during the Long March, existing ideological schisms between Soviet and Chinese strategical approaches of the \\"National Question\\" and the \\"Ethnic Question\\" in China widened. One of the major disagreements was the role of ethnic minorities in Chinese revolution, which quickly expanded into a political debate about ethnic sovereignty and human agency. The original Leninist principle of ethnic liberation argued for a linear political strategy of liberation in which enlightened proletariats bind their revolutionary forces with ethnic minorities against capitalists, while assuming the responsibility to ideologically \\"uplift\\" and transform minorities into able proletariat fighters. Heralded by the pro-Comintern leaders of the CCP, this theory was the ideological cornerstone that buttressed CCP conceptions of statehood like national self-determination (Chinese: 民族自决; Pinyin: Minzu Zijue) and federated republic (Chinese: 联邦共和; pinyin: Lianbang Gonghe). However, Mao disagreed with the Leninist model for two reasons: 1. The model of ethnic self-determination was inadequate for maintaining national unity; 2. The notion of ethnic \\"uplift\\" presupposes the passivity of ethnic minorities. For Mao, the ineffectuality of self-determination as a political model was self-explanatory, since this is the exact rhetoric which the Japanese Empire used to create the puppet state of Manchukuo. Shown in the example of Manchukuo, the failure of China to maintain its territorial sovereignty in the Northeast was primarily due to Japan's appeal to ethnic minority (in this case, the Manchu ethnicity that was the ruling aristocrats of the former Qing dynasty) desires for self-determination. Thus, to prevent further national disunity in China as a result of capitalist imperialists using ethno-cultural difference to \\"divide-and-rule\\" the proletariat population, Mao argued for a stronger form of ethnic sovereignty with limited ethnic autonomy. Map of Manchukuo, a puppet-state in Northeastern China created by the Japanese Empire during the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II With regards to Mao's second disagreement with the Leninist principle, Mao argued for an active mobilization of ethnic minorities for the revolutionary war effort. As a remedy to Leninism's subjugation of minority agency, Mao replaced Lenin's overtly condescending phrase \\"small and weak ethnic groups\\" (Chinese: 弱小民族; Pinyin: ruoxiao minzu) with a more innocuous and ambiguous term \\"minority nationals\\" (Chinese: 少数民族; Pinyin: shaoshu minzu). However, despite the fact that Mao refused to call ethnic minorities \\"inferior populations,\\" he recognized that some of their conditions of socioeconomic production were more primitive than that of the Han-Chinese majority. As a result, Mao argued that the active mobilization of ethnic minorities must involve the simultaneous transformation of ethnic minority economic landscapes and the cultivation of class consciousness, which departed from the classical Marxist ideal of economic determinism (\\"base determines superstructure\\"). This notion of active transformation was predicated on the assumption that ethnic minorities inhabit in a more \\"backwards\\" (but not inferior) space of production. In addition to the divergence from the Leninist principle of ethnic self-determination, Mao fervently rejected the KMT's theoretical conception of Chinese ethnic sovereignty. Here, the major disagreement came from Mao's idea that the \\"Chinese People\\" (Chinese: 中华民族; Pinyin: Zhonghua Minzu) was unified by ideology and cultural affinity, which contrasted with the KMT's narrative of a homogenous Chinese race tied by blood. In his writings, Mao dismissed the theory of Consanguineous Descent and Ethnic Sovereignty by the dominant KMT regime. These dominant theories included the Three People's Ideology (Chinese: 三民主义; Pinyin: Sanmin Zhuyi) by Sun Yat-sen and the racial ideology of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. Sun Yat- sen's political ideal espoused the restoration of Han-Chinese dominance in China, which directly spoke to popular anti-Manchurian sentiments during the late Qing Dynasty. Chiang Kai-shek went one step further by asserting that China is a racially and ethnically homogenous nation, with Han-Chinese being the ancestral inhabitant of China and all other ethnic minorities being sub- varieties of the Han. Mao critically rejected Chiang's theory and labelled him a \\"fascist\\" and \\"Han Chauvinist\\" for refusing to acknowledge the ethnic differences between Han-Chinese and other minorities. Mao's theory was also heralded by one of the key architects of the party ideology of Maoist thought, Li Weihan, who pointed out the hypocrisy of Chaing's promise of \\"ethnic equality\\" in the KMT's national congress with regards to the ethnic education policies of the Hui Muslim population in Northwestern China. Like Mao, Li argued that the Hui Muslim population were not descendants of the Han people. Thus, the \\"correct\\" way to deal with their ethnic difference was not to impose traditional Han culture onto their ways of living, but to enforce ideological education in order to transform their belief from the Islamic religion to the \\"scientific truth of Marxism-Leninism.\\" This phase of theoretical development marks Mao's practical attempts to reconcile the internationalist rhetoric of Marxism-Leninism with the CCP's desire to construct a multi-ethnic nation- state. = Wartime nationalism: 1937–1949 = Mao declared the establishment of the People's Republic of China on October 1st, 1949. The seizure of state power by the CCP shifted the focus of Mao's National Struggle theory from \\"the protection of national sovereignty from external forces\\" to the \\"preservation of socialism from internal enemies.\\" This paradigm shift would eventually lead to Mao's later decision to usher a \\"perpetual stage of internal struggle\\" during the intra-politicides in the 1950s. The third phase was the \\"New Democratic revolutionary phase\\" (July 1937 – October 1949). This phase of theoretical development is marked by the consolidation of Mao's political theory as the party orthodoxy during the war against Japanese Invasion (also called the Second Sino-Japanese War) from 1931–1945 and the subsequent war against the nationalists in the Chinese Civil War. During this period, Mao's political theory on ethnic sovereignty radically departed from the earlier Leninist approach that addressed the primacy of ethnic self-determination within the framework of Soviet Socialist Confederation. Moreover, Mao dissented from Stalin's approach to the \\"National Question\\" which emphasized the creation of a Russia-centric Soviet Union (\\"Socialism in one country\\"). On April 13, 1941, the Soviet Union signed the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact (Japanese: 日ソ中立条約 Romaji: Nisso Chūritsu Jōyaku), also known as the Japanese–Soviet Non-aggression Pact (Japanese: 日ソ不可侵条約 Romaji: Nisso Fukashin Jōyaku) with Japan two years after the brief Soviet–Japanese Border War (1939) As a retaliative reaction against USSR's non-aggression treaty with the Japanese Empire and Stalin's diplomatic recognition of Chiang Kai-shek as the head of China, Mao abandoned the USSR model of ethnic self-determination for the establishment of a unitary Chinese nation that would grant ethnic minorities partial ethnic autonomy under the Han-Chinese dominated CCP. According to historian James Leibold, Mao's new ethnic-autonomy theory necessitated the construction of a new cultural narrative of what \\"China\\" consists of demographically, geo-politically, and ethnographically. Mao's search for a nativist unity of the Chinese nation led to the theorization of a transitional phase of revolution that is absent in any other Marxist works outside of China. In Mao's theory of history, the stage of \\"New Democracy\\" is a transitional phase of interclass and interethnic unity before the seizure of state power by the Chinese Communist Party. In terms of the political ideal of \\"national struggle\\" and the theory of ethnic relationships, Mao proposed the construction of Ethnic Self-Autonomous prefectures under CCP leadership, deviating from the CCP's early conception of a loose multi-ethnic confederation as well as the so-called \\"fascist\\" conception of Han-centric homogeneous nationhood by the KMT. Li Weihan (1896–84), a member of the 6th Politburo of the CCP and the head of the UFWD The CCP's theoretical departure from the USSR was accompanied by a series of institutional transformations. One of which was the establishment of a distinctively Chinese bureaucratic agency named the United Front Work Department (UFWD) (Chinese: 中共中央统战部), dedicated to the regulation of ethnic relations and the preservation of national sovereignty under CCP leadership. The UFWD was created in Yan'an in 1942 during the height of the Second-Sino Japanese War. Although the UFWD was originally designed exclusively to deal with ethnic problems and contrive strategies to mobilize non-party local elites for the war against Japanese invasion, the UFWD shifted its strategic focus to the antagonization of KMT and the mobilization of ethnic minorities for national unification after the defeat of Japanese empire in 1945. Until 1949, the UFWD dealt exclusively with the question of National Struggle in China, with its 9th Department and 10th Department specifically devoted to the regulation of wartime Sino-Tibetan and Sino-Uighur relationships. In 1942, Li Weihan, the head of the UFWD, issued a strategic report to the CCP's Yan'an headquarters. In a report titled \\"Research on the Ethnic Question (1942)\\" (Chinese: 民族问题研究; Pinyin: Minzu wenti yanjiu) Li asserted that it was the responsibility of the \\"modern\\" Han majority, as China's ruling \\"Minzu\\" (ethnic group), to guide the Mongol, Hui, Tibetan, and other \\"backward minzus\\" toward their collective liberation and to foster the right environment in which \\"natural assimilation\\" (Chinese: 自然同化) could forge a new, more evolutionarily robust national people. This argument was predicated on the assumption that ethnic minorities could skip stages of economic development and become actively transformed into modern proletariats by having their economic terrains and productive forces transformed by the CCP leadership. Li Weihan's narrative corroborated Mao's innovative approach to the \\"National Question,\\" which expanded the narrow focus on \\"national liberation\\" in European and Soviet Marxism to embrace issues as ethnic development, state building, cultural identity, and national sovereignty in China. = Practical confrontations: 1949–1965 = Map of prefectures of Xinjiang Autonomous Region. Regions highlighted in yellow are autonomous prefectures that are directly under the jurisdiction and administration of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (Chinese: 新疆生产建设兵团; pinyin: Xīnjiāng Shēngchǎn Jiànshè Bīngtuán), known as XPCC or Bingtuan (兵团; Bīngtuán) for short. Along with the Construction Corps sent to Heilongjiang (Manchuria), Yunnan, Inner Mongolia, and Fujian under the PRC regime, the Construction Corps in Xinjiang was one of the state-owned, para-institutional military enterprises that were dispatched to the frontiers of China for regional and ethnic development. The XPCC is the only surviving Corporation Corp in the PRC today. Map of alt= The fourth phase was the \\"Party Orthodoxy Phase\\" (October 1949 – May 1965), which was a period of ideological radicalization after the Chinese communists had seized state power in 1949. This period of Maoist theoretical development is marked by the problems that stemmed from the CCP's practical confrontations with the reclamation of Manchuria, Xinjiang, and Tibet. Although Mao's political theory with regards to the regulation of ethnic minorities remained static during this time, this period is characterized by a series of political flip-flops, accomplishments, as well as disasters like the Hundred Flowers Campaign, the land reforms, the collectivization of agriculture, the Great Leap Forward, and the Great Famine. The most salient ideological crisis during this period was the inconsistency between the theory and praxis of the CCP with regards to local bureaucratic administration, ethnic education, and cultural preservation. Specifically, these problems entailed the paradoxical treatment of ethnic Tibetans, Uyghurs and Hui Muslim people by the Chinese Communist Party. On the one hand, the CCP promised ethnic equality by allowing limited degrees of cultural autonomy for minorities. On the other hand, the CCP imposed ideological education in ethnic schools and discouraged minorities from observing their cultural religious traditions because they have contradicted with the CCP's conception of Socialist Modernity. The theoretical remedy by Mao was to establish a unifying principle of \\"continuous National Struggle\\" that was unilaterally applied to each jurisdictional territories of ethnic autonomy. As a modification of Mao's earlier \\"National Struggle\\" theory, this theory argues that the quest for national struggle continues after the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949. This is because Mao reasoned that there was an unequal development of economic modes of production, social relations of production, and class consciousness between the ethnic minority hinterlands and the Han- majority urban areas in China. For example, in the Conference of the Central Committee in 1953, Mao stated that \\"some ethnic groups in Yunnan region continue to practice tribalism and live in primitive economic conditions of production.\\" Mao's solution to this problem was the criminalization of the practice of ethnic religions, accompanied by a series of land redistribution campaigns and technological experiments directed by sent-down cadres of the Constructions Corps. During the prelude to the Cultural Revolution from 1966–1976, the difficulties of maintaining China's ethnic sovereignty also intersected with the problem of what Mao called the \\"Restoration of Capitalism.\\" Mao's unique view of historical materialism rendered his conclusion that seizure of state power and means of production by the Communists was not the end goal, but the beginning of socialist construction. Having based his revolution on the peasantry — the petty bourgeoisie of the countryside according to Lenin — Mao reasoned that the only way for the nation to secure its path towards Socialist Construction was to usher a perpetual campaign of national, ethnic, and class struggle even after the Communists have nationalized private capital and controlled the state apparatus. Throughout the years of political radicalization, the Maoist theory of \\"national struggle\\" gradually diverged from the Soviet theory of revolution, which was guided by the Leninist principle of national self-determination within the USSR and Leon Trotsky's internationalist approach. Although Mao initially followed Stalin's strategy towards the \\"National Question,\\" Mao eventually discarded that idea when he faced a different demographic geography of ethnic identities in China's vast multi-ethnic terrain. In practice, Chinese communists under Mao's leadership approached the question of Xinjiang Insurrection, Tibetan Independence, and Hui Muslim dissent as problems that challenged the Chinese national sovereignty after the establishment of the PRC regime in 1949. The theoretical solution by Mao's party state was to reduce all of problems arising from the state's regulation of ethnocultural difference into an unequal distribution of the forces and relations of production. = Exporting revolution: 1966–1976 =  Impact  The international reception of Mao's theory of \\"national struggle\\" ranges from total rejection to critical appreciation. In the United States, rightist theorists have criticized Mao's theory of \\"national struggle\\" as the classical demonstration of hypocrisy within the socialist rhetoric of liberation. Other leftist scholars saw Mao's political theory as a capricious desire to subordinate Marx's dialectical historicism in the favor of China's particular realities in justification of Mao's political power. During the Cold War, the Maoist theory of \\"national liberation\\" was heralded by some French Marxists and Pan-Africanists as genuine political guidelines that could possibly provide a solution for self-sufficient development in third world economies if properly applied. After the death of Mao and the conclusion of the Cultural Revolution in 1976, public perception of Mao's political theory started turn negative globally. However, the contention over Maoism's contributions still exists today, as some scholars maintain that Mao's theory was actually rooted in Marx's dynamic notion of dialectical materialism, rather than the dogmatic application of Soviet stagiest theories of economic determinism. = Three Worlds Theory =  References  Further reading *Bernstein, Thomas and Li, Hua-yu (eds).China Learns from the Soviet Union, 1949–Present.

Reese suggests to let Elias (Enrico Colantoni) \\"take out the trash\\" but is convinced that their deaths would cause collateral damage. The Five Dons are discussing the issue with Elias. Gianni Jr. (Paul Schulze), wants to kill him but the other Dons forbid it as it could affect their businesses. After failing to get Carter's (Taraji P. Henson) help, Reese tries to save Don Caparelli (Tony Darrow) but he is killed when his car is blown up.

Luke Gelineau of TV Equals wrote \\"With only three episodes left this season after tonight's episode 'Flesh and Blood', Person of Interest returned tonight with the dramatic recurrence of the elusive M. Elias.\\" Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4.6 star rating out of 5 and wrote \\"This was a great episode that hit on all the marks that really makes Person of Interest stand out. I could gripe about a few smaller things like Carter's campy lines, the simplicity in which Elias got to everyone, or even him going in person to see Carter - but the show has done a fantastic job in making its characters and the overall story compelling week in and week out. It's just proving that this is a show whose numbers won't be up for a while.\\"  References  External links * \\"Flesh and Blood\\" at CBS \\"Flesh and Blood\\" at TV Guide * Person of Interest (TV series) episodes 2012 American television episodes ","title":"Flesh and Blood (Person of Interest)"},{"id":"55910075","text":"Montenegrin ( / Crnogorska; CG) is a minor liberal political party in Montenegro, founded in 2017 as the successor to Montenegrin Democratic Union (CDU).

As a juvenile in 2000 she showed high-class form, winning the Group 1 Moyglare Stud Stakes and being placed in both the Railway Stakes and the Debutante Stakes. In the following year she failed to win but ran well against top quality competition to finish fourth in the Irish 1000 Guineas and the Irish Oaks. After her retirement from racing she became a successful broodmare, most notably producing Henrythenavigator. Background Sequoyah was a bay mare bred in Ireland by the County Tipperary-based Brittas House Stud, which is owned by Peter Magnier, the brother of John Magnier. During her racing career she carried the colours of John Magnier's wife Susan and was trained by Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. She was from the thirteenth crop of foals sired by Sadler's Wells, who won the Irish 2000 Guineas, Eclipse Stakes and Irish Champion Stakes in 1984 went on to be the Champion sire on fourteen occasions. Sequoyah's dam Brigid showed modest racing ability, winning one minor race from five starts, but become a successful broodmare, producing several other good winners including Listen. She was a full-sister to Or Vison, the dam of Saffron Walden and Dolphin Street (Prix de la Forêt). Racing career =2000: two-year-old season= Rather than making her debut in a maiden race Sequoyah began her racing career in the Group 3 Railway Stakes over six furlongs at the Curragh on 2 July and finished third of the five runners behind her stablemate Honours List. She was dropped in class for a seven- furlong maiden at Tipperary Racecourse later that month and started 4/5 favourite against six opponents. Ridden by Mick Kinane, she led from the start and won by one and a half lengths from the Jim Bolger-trained Mood Indigo. Aidan O'Brien said that the filly would \\"do nothing but improve\\". On 20 August at the Curragh, Sequoyah started 4/1 favourite for the Listed Debutante Stakes, but after taking the lead in the last quarter mile she was caught in the final strides and beaten a short head by Affianced. Her stablemate Imagine was three lengths back in third. The filly was then stepped up to Group 1 class for the Group 1 Moyglare Stud Stakes at the same track on 3 September and started 9/4 favourite. Affianced and Imagine were again in opposition while the other seven runners included the British challenger Hotelgenie Dot Com who was made the 7/2 second choice in the betting. With Jamie Spencer in the saddle she raced towards the rear of the field as her unfancied stablemate Jungle Moon acted as pacemaker, before beginning to make progress entering the last quarter mile. She took the lead just inside the final furlong and drew away to by two and half lengths from Hotelgenie Dot Com. On her final appearance of the season Sequoyah was sent to England to contest the Cheveley Park Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 26 September. After tracking the leaders she was outpaced in the closing stages and finished fifth of the thirteen runners behind Regal Rose. =2001: three-year-old season= On her first run of 2001 Sequoyah ran in the Irish 2000 Guineas at the Curragh on 22 May in which she started a 14/1 outsider and came home fourth behind Imagine. In June she was sent to England for the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot in which she ran unplaced in a race won by the French-trained filly Banks Hill. In the following month she was stepped up in distance for the Irish Oaks over one and a half miles and finished fourth to Lailani after being slightly hampered in the closing stages. She ended her track career by finishing last to Lailani in the Nassau Stakes at Goodwood in August. Breeding record Following her retirement from racing, Sequoyah became a broodmare for the Coolmore Stud. She produced at least five foals and three winners between 2003 and 2009: *Queen Cleopatra, a bay filly, foaled in 2003, sired by Kingmambo.

It originally served as the northern terminus of the Eastern Railway. In 1968, the line was closed to passengers and the railway south of the station to Kfar Saba was abandoned. As of 2017, a short section of the Eastern Railway connecting the station north to the Coastal railway line is still in operation—being used by freight trains serving the large Granot \\"Ambar North\\" feed mill complex near Gan Shmuel that is located adjacent to Hadera East station.  History  During the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of World War I, the Ottoman authorities in Palestine constructed the railway between the Jezreel Valley railway in Afula southwards via Jenin and Tulkarm to Lydda, where it connected to the Jaffa–Jerusalem railway and the Railway to Beersheba. The northwards extension from Tulkarm to Hadera allowed transporting timber from the forests around Hadera that was used as fuel and for infrastructure. The line was built as narrow gauge (1050 mm) like the rest of the Ottoman railways in the region, and was situated relatively inland to avoid the reach of naval guns from Royal Navy warships patrolling the Mediterranean coast. In the forests of Hadera, the Ottoman railway split into two branches, one ending about a mile south-west from Hadera, the other about 1½ miles north from Karkur;Detail of Falls Map 21 / Official History of the Great War Based on Official Documents by Direction of the Historical Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence Volume 2 Part II Military Operations Egypt & Palestine from June 1917 to the end of the war neither of these branches served any settlement, although they provided a link with the military bases that developed around Hadera.Ottoman Palestine, 1800-1914: Studies in Economic and Social History / p. 207 The station building in 1946 The remains of the British station building in 2015 before undergoing restoration in 2020. After the British conquered the area, they converted the Eastern Railway to standard gauge and extended it further northwards, connecting Haifa with Lydda for onward journey west to Jaffa, east to Jerusalem, or south via Gaza City to El Kantara, Egypt. Prior to the construction of this new line, the only southbound connection from Haifa was the Jezreel Valley railway via Afula. Hadera East halt was constructed by Palestine Railways as part of this new line; it opened in 1920 at a location 1½ miles north-east from the town, and was served by buses from Hadera, Pardes Hanna and Karkur. Until the 1940s, the halt didn't include any facilities for waiting passengers, not even a canopy. The Tehran Children — a group of 1,230 Jewish refugees from Poland, mostly children, who escaped in 1939 to the USSR, then in 1942 to Iran, then brought by the Jewish Agency for Israel by sea to Suez, and from there on a train to the Yishuv — stopped at Hadera East station on 18 February 1943, and a festive greeting was arranged for the children. The new Coastal railway line was constructed during the early 1950s, and shortened the rail journey between Haifa and Tel Aviv from 1 hour and 20 minutes to just over 1 hour. The new railway line diverged from the old one at the Remez railway junction near Pardes Hanna, about 2.5 km north of Hadera East, which meant that Hadera East could not be served by the new passenger service between Haifa and Tel Aviv. In order for the new passenger service to include Hadera, the new Hadera West railway station, built 5 km south of Remez junction and 5 km west of the old railway station, opened to passengers in 1957. Nevertheless, some passenger and freight service via Hadera East continued until 1968, when the passenger service between Haifa and Jerusalem ended, the station closed, the railway track south of it abandoned and was later mostly dismantled.  Future plans  The government of Israel announced plans to revive the Eastern Railway at a projected cost of NIS 10 billion (appx. US$ 2.7 billion in 2018 dollars),https://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1001257655 reinstating a service from Haifa via Hadera and Kfar Saba to Lod which would bypass the congested Coastal railway south of Pardes Hanna. Out of the projected amount, NIS 50 million would fund the creation of a new Hadera East station, which would likely be situated within the site in a location that will allow for the preservation of the historic British buildings. As part of the project, extensive restoration of some of the station's historic building as began in early 2020.

The museum was established in 1978, its current site and exhibition opened to public on 1 November 2017. The museum utilizes the nineteenth century locomotive shed of the Peterhof Railway built in 1857–1858, however a large second exhibition building and open exhibition areas have been added. This Russian Railway Museum maintained by the Russian Railways is not to be confused with the Central Rail Transport Museum owned by the Federal Agency for the Rail Transport and located on Sadovaya str. History In 1974, the trade union and the management of the Oktyabrskaya Railway decided to establish a museum for the employees of the enterprise. The first exhibition opened in 1978 and was located in the centre of Leningrad, on Liteyny Avenue. Later a small group of enthusiastic railway workers proposed to preserve the historical rolling stock pieces. Their proposal was met by the railway management that provided a site in the southern outskirts of the city to store and repair locomotives and carriages. The museum in Shushary opened for public in 1991, and the nearby commuter rail station \\"16-th kilometer\\" used by visitors to reach the museum was renamed to \\"Parovozny Muzey\\" (\\"Museum of Steamers\\"). The museum occupied 7500 square meters and possessed 40 exhibits including 18 locomotives of different kinds. In May 2001, Varshavsky railway station in St. Petersburg was closed for the scheduled passenger services and the most valuable part of the museum's collection in Shushary was placed along its platforms. In August 2001, the new site of the museum was opened for public. On 20 thousand square meters, about 80 items of historical rolling stock were put on display. Once the collection was relocated to the central part of the city, the number of visitors has sixfolded, and the museum became one of the popular places of interest of its kind. Visitors could also make a rail journey on a train pulled by a retro steamer. However, as the Varshavsky station building was provided exclusively for the commercial use, the museum had no indoor exhibition. Besides, the tracks of the former station were to be removed to free up the space for the planned residential construction. Thus in 2007-2012, the project of the new site was drawn and by late 2017 its construction was accomplished. On 30 October 2017, the renewed site of the Russian Railway Museum was opened in the reconstructed building of the former locomotive depot of the Baltiysky railway station. It consists of indoor and outdoor exhibitions storing around 35000 historical artifacts including 118 items of rolling stock. Being one of the biggest railway museums in Europe, in 2019 the museum became a nominee for the European Museum of the Year Award by the European Museum Forum. Overview Most of the exhibits were previously displayed in the October Railway Museum at the former Varshavsky railway station. However, more exhibits have been added to the collection and much of the museum collection is under the roof. The whole story of railways is shown from Richard Trevithick to the present day. Two HO railway models are also present. One model is of Russia’s first passenger railway – the Tsarskoye Selo Railway and the second of Vladivostok Station. The RT-23 Molodets railway missile train and the Obukhovskii 12\\"/52 Pattern 1907 gun#1938 Railway gun TM-3-12 Railway gun are parked outside at the open exhibition area. One of the unique pieces is the TEP-80 (ТЭП-80) diesel locomotive that set the world record of diesel train speed – 271 km/h – in 1993. The museum features the first diesel locomotive built in Soviet Russia in 1924 by Lenin's decree. Interactive elements such as a simulator of TEP-70 (ТЭП-70) locomotive are available. The museum provides lecturing and educational facilities. Most of the locomotives and cars may be only watched from the outside, but there are ones that may be boarded. The environment of the museum is designed to be disabled-friendly. Full descriptions of exhibits are provided in both Russian and English. Guided tours are provided at extra charge.

This party later formed the core of the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas (Tagalog, \\"Communist Party of the Philippines\\") which was established in 1930. History Crisanto Evangelista had been an active labor organizer since 1906 and was an organizer of the Congreso Obrero de Filipinas (Spanish, \\"Philippine Labor Congress\\") in 1913. Evangelista was also affiliated with the Nacionalista Party but in 1924 he, Ponce and Bognot failed to acquire berths in the Nacionalista Party's lineup as Manila councilors. They established Partido Obrero de Filipinas in response, seeing the group as a counterpoint to the colonial political parties.

She was convicted of treason for stealing from her owner, and hanged from a sycamore tree in Darlington, South Carolina. She is believed to have been the last female slave to be legally executed. Background Spain was owned by Major Albertus C. Spain, a Mexican–American War veteran who owned a large property in Darlington, South Carolina, and had been a member of the South Carolina Secession Convention. She was about 17 years old at the time of her death, and was referred to as \\"mulatto\\", with sources noting her light skin. In early 1865, a detachment of the Union Army arrived in Darlington as part of the Carolinas Campaign.\\"Confederate forces hanged Amy Spain 94 years ago\\", The Augusta Chronicle-Herald, May 10, 1959. Spain reputedly exclaimed \\"bless the Lord, the Yankees have come!\\".Hanging of Amy Spain, Harper's Weekly, September 30, 1865. Retrieved November 28, 2017. Many white residents (including almost all adult men) had deserted the town by that point, and the Union commander allowed slaves to take whatever belongings had been left behind. Spain and her brother Willie dragged some mahogany furniture from an abandoned warehouse, and later took \\"linens, sheets, pillow cases, flour, sugar, lard, and some furniture\\" from the home of their master. Trial and execution The Union Army soon moved on from Darlington, and its residents returned. A short time later Confederate troops (led by General Joseph Wheeler) re-occupied the town. Those who had stayed behind during the Union occupation reported that Spain had been the \\"ringleader\\" of the looting, and accused her specifically of guiding Union troops to places where valuables had been hidden. Spain was captured and charged with \\"treason and conduct unbecoming a slave\\" by a Confederate military tribunal; Major Spain reputedly acted as her defense counsel. She was sentenced to death, and hanged from a sycamore tree in the Darlington town square on March 10, 1865. Aftermath The September 30, 1865, edition of Harper's Weekly gave a somewhat embellished account of Spain's execution, proclaiming that \\"her name is now hallowed among the Africans\\". The story and its accompanying illustration were reprinted by many Northern newspapers. Harper's Weekly attributed the greater share of responsibility to Darlington's residents rather than the Confederate troops, stating that her execution \\"was acquiesced in and witnessed by most of the citizens of the town\\".

Created by the writer and director Wes Craven, she is portrayed by Sandra Peabody in the 1972 original film and by Sara Paxton in 2009 remake of the same name. Making her debut appearance in The Last House on the Left (1972), Mari serves as the heroine; predating the characters of Nancy Thompson and Sidney Prescott who served as the protagonists of Craven's landmark series A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984-1987) and Scream (1996-2011), respectively. The 2009 incarnation of the character has been observed by some scholars to follow the \\"final girl\\" archetype, contrasting with her original depiction. Outside of film, Mari has appeared in merchandise based on the original film. Appearances =In film= Original Mari is planning on going to a concert to see the controversial band Bloodlust with her more world weary best friend Phyllis Stone for her 17th birthday despite her parent's initial reluctance to allow her to go. Mari's mother expresses her disapproval of her friendship with Phyllis and her father questions why she's interested in a band mostly known for notoriety. Phyllis arrives and before Mari leaves, her parents give her a peace sign necklace for her birthday gift. While in the city, they are lured into an apartment to buy marijuana. Inside the apartment, they are held captive by a group of escaped convicts by the names of Krug, Fred, Sadie, and Junior. Mari and Phyllis are abducted and taken into the middle of the woods. Mari realizes in horror that she is by the road near her house but is unable to escape there for help. While in the woods, the girls are humiliated and assaulted. Phyllis runs away in an attempt to distract the killers so that Mari can escape. However, Mari is being watched by Junior and she attempts to gain his trust by renaming him \\"Willow\\" and by giving him her peace sign necklace. This works and the two attempt to evade Krug, Sadie, and Fred. Phyllis is killed and after being assaulted, a hopeless Mari wanders into a nearby pond knowing that she is going to be murdered. She is shot multiple times by Krug and is left for dead. She is found dead by her parents. Mari subsequently appears in Junior's nightmares. Remake Mari is a competitive swimmer who goes on vacation with her parents John and Emma to their lake house. Mari takes the family car and drives into town to hang out with her friend Paige. While Paige is finishing her shift as a cashier, they meet a teenager named Justin, who invites them both back to his motel room to smoke marijuana. While there, Justin's family members return: Krug, Justin's father; Francis, Justin's uncle; and Sadie, Krug's girlfriend. Due to the widespread media coverage of Krug's recent escape from police custody, the criminals decide to kidnap them and steal Mari's car to leave town. Mari convinces Krug to take a road that is in the direction of her parents' lake house; in an attempt to escape, Mari burns Sadie's face with a cigarette lighter and attempts to jump out of the vehicle, but is unable to when the car crashes. After being raped by Krug, Mari manages to escape the criminals and make it to the lake so she can swim to safety. However, Krug shoots her in the back and she is left for dead, but she is later revealed to have survived. Mari manages to reach her parent's porch and with them seeks revenge; Mari, John, Emma, and Justin then take a boat to the hospital. =In merchandise= Pallbearer Press released LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT SHIRT, a Horror T-shirt with Mari being the main part of the design. Development Returning to New York after a cross-country road trip, Peabody was originally asked by the film makers to audition for the role of Phyllis after responding to casting notice in the trade publication Backstage. After meeting the producer Sean S. Cunningham she was cast as Mari. Craven stated, \\"I liked Sandra Peabody a lot; I thought she was very pretty, and very plucky... because she was a very young actress, she wasn't nearly as confident and easy going as Lucy was, and she had become involved in something very, very rough. And she hung in there. When the character was raped, she was treated very roughly, and I know Sandra said to me afterwards, 'My God... I had the feeling they really hated me.'\\" Jacob Knight interpreted that Wes Craven created Mari with the intention of her being a metaphor of peace and innocence during an era of apprehension, \\"He wants us to see her as a sexual object, the peace sign necklace her parents gift to her before she heads into the city no match for the angry, depraved, aggressors who tear her and Phyllis’ clothes off. In this way, Craven has molded Mari to be something of an avatar for how he views the “Love Generation”; inexperienced balls of flesh who think their hippie posturing will save them from society's wolves.\\" Sara Paxton attending the premiere of The Last House on the Left (2009) Various cast and crew of the original film have stated that Sandra Peabody was genuinely unnerved during the entire making of the film and at one point walked off set. In an interview for David A. Szulkin's non-fiction book Wes Craven's Last House on the Left, Peabody confirmed the discomfort that she felt throughout the making of the film and the difficulty of working with Method actor David Hess, who threatened to assault her to get a genuine reaction from her. Sara Paxton revealed that she only auditioned for the film as an acting exercise and was not expecting to obtain the role. In an interview, Paxton stated, \\"In the audition, Dennis was like, 'So how’s your swimming ability?' And I was like, 'I played a mermaid. I’m an amazing swimmer. You have no idea. I’m great.' And they were like, 'Oh wow, she’s a great… Hey, she’s a good swimmer.' Then I actually got on set and I just remember submerging under water and hearing, 'Cut! Oh my God, she is drowning! She is drowning right now. Somebody get her some floaties, something!' I guess I wasn’t that good. I was more talk.\\" Despite the intense subject matter, Paxton described her experience on set as a positive one and when asked about what it was like to work with the producers Wes Craven and Jonathan Craven, she stated: :\\"He was more like the Wizard of Oz – the man behind the curtains. He was really involved in everything, but he was manning the controls backing in the states since we filmed the movie in Africa. His son, Jonathan Craven, was an executive producer on the movie and he was amazing to work with. It was a great set to be on. They really cared about us, especially me because I was the youngest out of the group.\\" Dennis Iliadis, the director of the 2009 film, wanted to add more characterization and depth to the character of Mari and revealed that the writers decided to make her a competitive swimmer which attributes to her character development and survival later on in the film. In an interview, Iliadis stated: :\\"Well, the idea was to find something where she channels all her energy. That was a big character trait, because her brother is dead. It's like she's carrying him on her back; she needs to perform for two people now. She has to compensate for him. So all her energy's in the water. The only area where she feels slightly free is when she's in the water, swimming like crazy, so it's interesting having that as a character trait, and then having that as a key element for her trying to escape.\\" Reception Film critic John Kenneth Muir described Mari as a \\"well-developed character.\\" Editor Stefano Lo Verme compared Peabody's performance as Mari to the performances of Marilyn Burns as Sally Hardesty in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) and Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode in Halloween (1978). Similarly, in an article published for The Washington Post, film critic Ann Hornaday noted the similarities between Collingwood and both Strode and Hardesty, writing that all three characters \\"personified the qualities and character beats of the quintessential final girl at her most admirable and frustrating: She was virginal, whereas her contemporaries were hormonal and sex-crazed (impulses for which they would be duly tortured and punished). She was levelheaded when all around her were giving way to hysteria. She was fiercely protective of those in her care rather than merely out for self-preservation. Most important, she outlived the villain, or at least didn’t allow herself to die at his hand.\\" In Rape-Revenge Films: A Critical Study, Alexandra Heller-Nicholas notes that that 2009 version of the character, unlike the original incarnation, exhibits traits of the \\"final girl\\" trope, stating: :\\"The most obvious shift towards a more generic horror structure, however, manifests in the \\"final girl\\" elements of Mari's character that are absent in the original. In 2009, Mari is not interested in drugs and argues it (although she finally succumbs). She fights back consistently throughout her attack; she deliberately lures Krug to her parents house as a way of possibly getting help; and Krug himself even observes at one point that she is a \\"cool customer.\\" The film celebrates Mari's determination to survive, and the fact that this Mari lives and the 1972 one does not inadvertently acts as condemnation of the earlier version. The 2009 Mari was a fast swimmer and could get away (she was still shot, but only in the shoulder). But the 1972 Mari was physically unable to escape, and thus her \\"punishment\\" was death. Sara Paxton's Mari in the recent The Last House on the Left is not killed, and this presents the possibility that she herself was able to enact her own revenge, a dramatic act that would have significantly moved the film from being a rape revenge film where her parents act for her, to one where the raped woman seeks vengeance on her own behalf.\\" :\\"The depiction of Mari after Krug and his gang leave her (assuming she is dead) is a clear genre-marker, as she climbs out of the dark water at night to stumble home Creature from the Black Lagoon-style. This depiction of her as a vacant monster continues throughout the rest of the film. Mari is not so much a rape survivor as she is the walking dead, whose only function is to provide her parents (specifically her father) with a motivation for violent an spectacular vengeance. Even in the scenes where John performs emergency surgery on their living room coffee table, Mari's face is mostly turned from the camera. It is less about her reaction and trauma than it is the impact her traumatized body has on her father.\\" In an interview with The Terror Trap, David Hess (who portrayed Krug Stillo in 1972 film) discussed the relationship that he had with Sandra Peabody on set and the audience's emotional connection to Mari, stating: :\\"...there’s a visceral attraction to Sandra’s Mari in the film. Krug does that. And then the other thing is that he really feels kind of filthy, kind of dirty when he attacks this innocent. But he can’t help himself. He’s gone too far at that point. And that’s the way we inter-related, even when we weren’t shooting. Sandra was an innocent and I held my character.\\" See also * Nancy Thompson * Sidney Prescott * Sally Hardesty * Laurie Strode References Works cited * Wes Craven characters Film characters introduced in 1972 Teenage characters in film Final girls Fictional sexual assault victims Fictional victims of kidnapping ","title":"Mari Collingwood"},{"id":"55910350","text":"Show Time is a live album by saxophonist Arnett Cobb with guests appearances by Dizzy Gillespie and Jewel Brown which was recorded in Houston in 1987 and released on the Fantasy label the following year.Fantasy Album Discography, Part 6: F-9600-F-9668 Main Series (1980–1983) accessed November 28, 2017Arnett Cobb catalog accessed November 28, 2017 Reception The AllMusic review by Scott Yanow stated \\"Tenor saxophonist Arnett Cobb's next-to-last recording was cut at a concert in Houston that was held to celebrate his 69th birthday.

Ellis work thematically is focused on aspects of the troubles in Northern Ireland, depicting stylized characters against the backdrop of every day scenes of urban life, the characters are clearly affected by the political violence that surrounds them. Ellis unlike other Northern Irish artists was not shying away from depicting the reality of living in a divided sectarian society where violence had become a normalized part of everyday life. Ellis characters stare out from the canvas, their unknown back story possibly marked by the omni-present violence of sectarianism. Ellis’ restrained gloomy palette of the sombre urban landscape is populated by demoralized and fearful characters navigating their way through a troubled landscape, their interior personal world is deeply affected by the complexity of the external political forces at work. http://papervisualart.com/2010/02/18/pakenham-and-ellis-a-study-of-two- artists-working-in-belfast-during-the-70s/ https://artuk.org/discover/artists/ellis-brendan-b-1951 References 1951 births Irish artists Living people ","title":"Brendan Ellis"},{"id":"55910560","text":"Michael Anthony Mallory II (born February 8, 1994) is an American professional basketball player who last played for Novi Pazar of the Basketball League of Serbia.

In early 2016 she was reported to be missing by her father, who initially filed a police case and then a habeas corpus petition in the Kerala High Court to trace her; Hadiya has described the circumstances of her leaving as her father forbidding her from practicing Islam. She left her home for college on 6 January, dressed in a Hijab. She was staying with A.S. Zainaba, president of Popular Front of India (PFI)'s women's wing National Women's Front (NWF). She had converted to Islam and married a Muslim man Shafin Jehan. Shafin Jehan is an active member of PFI affiliated Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI). Her family alleged she was brainwashed and her marriage was forced, but Hadiya says she did of her own volition. In May 2017, Hadiya's marriage was annulled by the High Court of Kerala on the grounds of a report submitted by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to the Supreme Court of India (SC), saying that Hadiya was a victim of indoctrination and psychological kidnapping, and that their claims of their marriage being arranged through a matrimony website were \\"bogus\\". The High Court of Kerala then handed over Hadiya's custody to her father, Ashokan, arguing that \\"As per Indian tradition, the custody of an unmarried daughter is with the parents, until she is properly married.\\" Shafin Jahan appealed the Kerala High Court order, and moved to the Supreme Court. In November 2017, the Supreme Court of India directed Hadiya to resume her internship, and that she was free to meet whomever she wanted. In March 2018, the Supreme court restored Hadiya's marriage, 10 months after the Kerala High Court annulled it. This case is often reported in media with headline containing the term love jihad.https://edition.cnn.com/2018/04/11/asia/india-love-jihad-intl/index.html Stakeholders Key organisations and people involved and mentioned in Hadiya's High Court and Supreme Court cases are as follows. * People  Hadiya (Akhila Ashokan): A student of homeopathy. Hadiya says she converted to Islam of her own will, then married Shafin Jahan of her own will, and wants to return to her husband. Hadiya claims she was tortured by Siva Sakthi Yoga Centre workers, who tried to convert her back to Hinduism, who were directed to her by her father. Claims she has been illegally incarcerated by her father for 11 months.  A.S. Zainaba: Hadiya chose to live with Zainaba after she left her home. Zainaba is a member of PFI, and SDFI; and the President of PFI's women's wing National Women's Front.  Shafin Jehan: He married Hadiya. Their marriage was annulled by the Kerala High Court. He filed the case in Supreme Court to appeal the decision. He is member of SDPI and PFI. NIA claims Shafin has 4 criminal cases lodged against him, but the SP Kerala Police says there's only one case related to campus politics, which had to do with him being admin of a whatsapp group.  Asokan K. M.: Akhila's father, an atheist and ex-serviceman, who went to the High Court claiming that his brainwashed daughter Hadiya's marriage was based on forced conversion and her safety was at risk. His daughter, Hadiya, as accused Ashokan of holding her in \\"unlawful custody\\" for 11 months, from forbidding her from practicing the faith of her choice, and who is trying to keep her from the man she chose as her husband. * Hindu Organizations  Siva Sakthi Yoga Centre: a Hindu centre that visited Hadiya upon Ashokan's request, and whom Hadiya alleges \\"tortured\\" her and tried to re-convert her. There have been numerous other allegations of torture at the hands of Siva Sakthi Yoga Centre, where Hindu women are forced by their families to go and reconvert to Hinduism. * Islamic organisation Popular Front of India (PFI): An Islamic fundamentalist organisation. According to NIA, PFI and its partner Islamic state Al-Hindi have plans to launch terrorist actions in India. Shafin Jehan and Zainaba are PFI members.  National Women's Front (NWF): PFI's women's wing headed by Zainaba.  Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI): Another wing of PFI. Shafin Jehan and Zainaba are SDPI members.  Sathya Sarani: An Islamic Charitable Trust. * Government organisations  High Court of Kerala (HCK): Annulled Hadiya's marriage held under suspicious circumstances.  Supreme Court of India (SC): Currently hearing the ongoing case filed by Safin Jehan to gain access to Hadiya.  National Investigation Agency NIA: India's premier national agency that investigates terrorism cases, was asked by the SC to investigate if there has been large scale systematic forced conversions to Islam with the view to carry out terrorist activities. NIA told SC that Hadiya is \\"a victim of indoctrination and psychological kidnapping\\", claims that their marriage was arranged through a matrimony website were totally false, and her handlers who arranged her marriage were only looking for active worker of radical outfit PFI as her groom. NIA had recommended to SC and government to ban PFI as it runs terror camps and makes bomb, with plans to carry out terror attacks against India with the help of Islamic state Al-Hindi. Religious conversion Hadiya, who grew up as Akhila Ashokan, belonged to a family from Vaikom, Kottayam. She is the only child of an atheist ex-serviceman, K.M. Ashokan and his wife Ponnamma. She lived with her parents and studied at local schools until 12th standard, which she passed at the second attempt. While pursuing her bachelor's degree at Sivaraj Homeopathic Medical College at Salem, she converted to Islamic faith.She became interested in Islam after seeing two of her collegemates, Faseena and Jaseela. On 6 January 2016 Akhila went missing from a house in Selam, where she was staying with her friends, Faseena and Jaseena, and parents filed the police complaint against the friends and their father Aboobacker Hadiya insisted in the High Court that it was a personal choice, her family argued that she is the victim of love jihad, and court annulled her marriage with the observation that she was a \\"weak and vulnerable girl capable of being exploited\\". Court also said in its order that \\"Shefin Jahan is one such person who has been assigned to play the role of going through a sham of a marriage with Ms. Akhila, with the object of transporting her out of India.\\" She told the court that she was \\"impressed\\" by her friends' \\"timely prayers and good character.\\" She told the court she had been practicing Islam for 3 years without formally announcing the change of faith, but she started the legal procedure for conversion only by September 2015. Her parents learnt about the conversion when she refused to participate in her grandfather's funeral ritual at her home. She subsequently returned to college wearing a headscarf. In January 2016, Akhila left her home and joined a course on Islam at \\"Therbiathul Islam Sabha\\", a Kozhikode Islamic study centre, as an 'external candidate' after filling an affidavit that she converted on her on accord. She planned to stay at her roommates' residence in Kerala during the study period. However, her roommates' father Aboobacker refused to let her continue at his residence, following which she approached Satya Sarani, an educational institution and conversion centre at Manjeri, Malappuram. While at Satya Sarani, she stayed with A.S. Zainaba, president of NWF and member of its parent radical Islamist organisation PFI as well as member of PFI's other front SDPI. NWF is women's wing of PFI. PFI, having links with banned Islamist terrorist organisation group SIMI and Pakistan's ISI, is involved with Islamic terrorist acts and groups.Inside a Mangalore jail, two deaths and a communal crack Meanwhile, Hadiya's father had filed a missing person's police case, and after being unable to trace her, he filed the first case in the high court. High Court lawsuit In February 2016, Akhila's father Ashokan filed a missing person's case at the local police station. Following the case, Aboobacker was arrested by the police. Despite the police case, Akhila could not be traced, meanwhile Akhila was in contact with the \\"Sathya Sarani\\" organisation which placed Zainaba in charge of Akila. During this period, she changed her name to Hadiya. At the High Court of Kerala, Hadiya's father filed a habeas corpus petition alleging that Satya Sarani has involved in \\"forced and illegal\\" religious conversions. Hadiya testified that she was staying with Zainaba out of her free will. The court dismissed Ashokan's petition and let Hadiya continue learning Islam and live with Zainaba, observing that she was not in illegal confinement. Following this, Ashokan filed a second petition in August 2016, alleging that Hadiya is likely to be transported out of the country after getting her married off to a Muslim man. The High court passed an interim order to keep Hadiya in surveillance to ensure that she was not taken outside of India. While she was in surveillance, the police found that she has moved from Zainaba's house to an undisclosed location. Though Hadiya denied the plan to travel abroad, the court directed her to stay at a women's hostel in Kochi. In September, the court let her live with Zainaba again, when she testified that she does not possess a passport, and pleaded that she was being lodged in the hostel \\"for no fault of hers\\". On 19 December, the court directed Hadiya to move to the college hostel in Salem to complete her medical studies. Her father, Ashokan, was asked to produce her certificates on 21 December so that she could resume her studies. Marriage On 21 December 2016, Akhila appeared before the high court accompanied by \\"a stranger.\\" This was nearly a year after she had left home and formally converted, she appeared in court with a man named Shafin Jahan, who she said she had married. Shafin Jehan is an active member of SDPI and allegedly also a member of the radical Islamic outfit PFI, with 4 criminal cases against him. SDPI is political front of Islamic fundamentalist organisation PFI. Hadiya married Shafin Jehan on 19 December 2016, the same day she had appeared before the court. The marriage was solemnized under Muslim law. Hadiya's lawyer later informed that she had signed up on a Muslim matrimony website \\"waytonikah.com\\", and that Shafin's proposal came through the site. In May 2017, the High Court annulled Hadiya's marriage with Shefin, and sent her to her parents’ house in Vaikom. Although the court order was to only provide her police protection, she was not permitted by her father to leave her home or meet anyone, an allegation denied by her father as she was fully surrounded by police inside and outside the house. According to Asokan, Hadiya refused to leave the house and go outside even though she was allowed to. Chairperson of State Women's commission, and several activists were prevented from meeting Hadiya, among those a trespassing case was registered against seven people. However, the chairperson of National Commission for Women visited her and noted that she was \\"happy and smiling\\", \\"her health and security are good\\", and that Hadiya did not report any atrocities or harm done to her. At Supreme Court Her husband, Shafin Jehan approached the Supreme Court for challenging the High Court order. At Supreme Court, Hadiya expressed her will to continue practicing Islam, live with her husband and complete her internship. She told that she was unlawfully kept under custody at her parents' home and demanded freedom. NIA, which investigates terror cases, was asked by the court to investigate if there are organised groups attempting to recruit Hindu women as terrorists by getting Muslim men to convert and marry them, had submitted to court that Hadiya's is an example of \\"psychological kidnapping\\", there is evidence of nearly 90 \\"similar cases\\" of indoctrination and radicalisation in Kerala, and that the court should not go by her statement. Evidence adduced by the NIA showed that claims that Hadiya met Safin Jehan through matrimony website 'waytonikah.com' was \\"totally false and entirely bogus\\". NIA further alleged that the only condition of the handlers who arranged their marriage was that the groom should be an active worker of the PFI, a radical outfit. The judges were livid with what had happened and questioned why the court had been kept in the dark regarding the marriage. The court raised several doubts about the hurried nature of the marriage, and doubted the manner in which the wedding ceremony was conducted. The Supreme Court allowed her to return to Salem and pursue her internship. Further hearing in this case, including the decision on the annulment of marriage will be considered by the court in January 2018. Hadiya responded that she was happy with the Supreme Court's decision allowing her to continue her education. On 23 January 2018, the Supreme court continued hearing the Hadiya Marriage case. When the Counsel for Mr Ashokan (Hadiya’s father) argued that the circumstances leading to the marriage must be investigated, the court emphasised that Hadiya’s marital status could not be looked into by the Court. Being a 24-year old adult, Hadiya had the power to make her own decisions, and the Court could not compel her to go to her father or husband against her will. Neither could the Court look into the character of the person Hadiya had married. The bench reiterated that investigating the marriage in such a manner would set a bad precedent in law. Hadiya has now been made a party to the proceedings as per the request of Mr Kapil Sibal. She can file her own response. This is a positive development as earlier Supreme Court was criticised for not adding Hadiya as a party and denying an adult woman agency in an important matter like marriage choice. The matter has been listed to be next heard on 22 February 2018.http://scobserver.clpr.org.in/hadiya-case- day-3-arguments/ On 8 March 2018, Hadiya's marriage was restored by the Supreme Court.  NIA Investigation According to the ongoing probe by the NIA, Shafin Jahan is accused of having alleged connections with two ISIS members Manseed and P Safvan, accused in the Omar-al-Hindi case, through Facebook group Popular Front of India (PFI) which allegedly deals with activities of SDPI. Muneer, Shafin Jahan's friend, brought Hadiya and him together. The probe by the investigation agency has also revealed certain discrepancies in what the couple had earlier claimed about meeting on the matrimonial site. The Supreme Court is now hearing Shafin Jahan's appeal against the annulment. According to sources, Shafin had registered his name on the website on 19 September 2015, while Sainaba (the lady who Hadiya stayed with, after leaving her parents’ home) registered the name of Hadiya and her own daughter, Fathima Thesni, on 17 April 2016. Hadiya viewed 49 profiles between 17 April and 23 April, but not of Shafin. In the same way, Jahan viewed 67 profiles, but not Hadiya's. As per NIA's report in the \\"love jihad\\" case, the marriage proposal of Shafin Jahan had come through Muneer during August 2016.

However, there was only a shortage of petrol not diesel or kerosene.  Events  The Sri Lanka fuel crisis began on 3 November 2017 when rumours started spreading that a fuel shipment belonging to Lanka IOC (Indian Oil Company) was rejected. Later on the rumour was confirmed as legitimate and the reason given was that the fuel in the rejected shipment was not up to standards.

However the Ministry of Petroleum Resources Development announced that there was 10,000 metric tonnes fuel in the reserves to last till 9 November 2017 but the leader of the Ceylon Petroleum Union, Asanka Ranawala said the contrary to this. Due to development of the tense situation the general public started panic buying causing the reserves to deplete faster than expected.

Other causes  Other than the substandard fuel rejected being the main reason for the crisis there were several other events that worsened the crisis during this time period. * Delay of other fuel ship - the rejected fuel shipment arrived in Sri Lanka on 15 October 2017 and on 17 October 2017 was rejected however this did not cause any panic as \\"Nevaska Lady\\" the fuel ship which was supposed to arrive on 4 November 2017 for the CPC but even this ship had to extend its arrival date to 11 November 2017. This is what led to the rumors regarding the fuel shortage originated from which made the public panic * Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery Shutdown - another issue faced in this crisis was the power loss which caused the Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery to be shut down for almost three days. The Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery is the only Oil Refinery in the whole island which caused an outrage among general public after what happened. * No replacement for rejected stock - The Lanka IOC informed that they were unable to replace the rejected stock and continued to harbor the rejected stock in the Trincomalee harbor. This was the initial problem which fused the shortage and caused the crisis.  Implemented solutions  Many steps were taken by the Ministry of Petroleum Resources Development to overcome the problem until any fuel shipments arrived * Purchasing from Spot Market - Fuel was purchased from the Spot Market to immediately recover from the shortage. An amount of 8,500 barrels were purchased from the spot market whereas the price have been concealed from the public. * Releasing petrol station reserves - After the demand for petrol went high the Ministry of Petroleum ordered fuel stations to give put from their reserves without any hesitation.  Aftermath  A cabinet sub committee was appointed by the President of Sri Lanka Maithripala Sirisena in order to investigate the crisis on the 7 November 2017. According to the report submitted by the committee on 17 November 2017 the main reason for the crisis was the failure to maintain proper fuel stocks according to the average use and another reason was the failure to report the dire situation to higher authorities on time causing the whole situation to go out of hand. However, according to the officials the report is inconclusive and the sub committee has also requested recruiting technical officers to get a more detailed report.

After spending over ten years at the Ministry of Manpower and Development, she joined the Prime Minister's office in 1992. She was elected as a ZANU–PF Member of Parliament in 2015, serving for the same constituency as her husband after he became Vice- President under Robert Mugabe. Biography Born on 25 March 1963 in Mazowe District in Mashonaland Central, Auxillia was the second child in a family of five. She was brought up on a farm in Chiweshe where she attended primary and secondary school. Her parents divorced when she was in Grade 3. After completing a secretarial course at Silveira House, Chishawasha, in 1981, she worked for the Ministry of Manpower and Development under Edgar Tekere. She entered politics in 1982, eventually rising to the politburo. From 1992, she was assigned to the Prime Minister's office, joining the Central Intelligence Organisation in 1997. Some reports maintain that from 1992, acting as a high- level security officer at the Sheraton Hotel, she provided information to Mugabe on Emmerson Mnangagwa who was then the de facto head of the CIO. She denies these assertions. In 1997, she began studying in the Environment and Tourism department at the University of Zimbabwe. She left for Switzerland two years later, graduating in Hotel and Tourism Administration in 2001. On her return to Zimbabwe, she joined the finance department of ZANU-PF in Kwekwe. Following an unsuccessful attempt to stand for the ZANU-PF in her native Mazowe Central, she joined the party's Central Committee in 2009. On behalf of Zanu-PF, she set up a number of women's banks in at Silobela, Zhombe, Kwekwe and Chirumanzu-Zibagwe in Zimbabwe's Midlands Province. Following her husband's appointment as Vice-President, she stood as the Member of Parliament for Chirumanzu–Zibagwe. After the withdrawal of the two other candidates, she went on to win the parliamentary by-election in 2015. Personal life It is believed she married Emmerson Mnangagwa following the death of his previous wife Jayne, the sister of Josiah Tongogara, at which point she became his third wife. They have three children together: Emmerson Jr., Sean, and Collins.

During NIMI, visual engagement or attention leads subconsciously to lower levels of fidgeting (and other non-instrumental movements). Non-Instrumental movements are bodily actions that are not related to the goal of the current task; for example, when in a classroom and the goal is to listen to a lecture, non-instrument (unnecessary) movements include fidgeting, scratching, postural micromovements, and certain emotional expressions. NIMI is important for recognizing boredom during human-robot interaction, human-computer interaction, computer-aided learning with automated tutoring systems, market research, and experience design.  Historical Evidence  The original observation that, in a seated audience, interest is associated with diminished fidgeting, and that boredom doubles the amount of human movement, was made by Francis Galton in 1885. Modern experiments suggesting that movement inhibition (and NIMI) were quantifiable and related to flow or interest were suggested by a series of papers regarding automated tutoring systems by Sidney D’Mello and colleagues. Using a non- visual task, Paul Seli and collaborators showed that increased episodes of mind wandering led to an increase in fidgeting, presumably because attention requires comparative stillness (maintaining that stillness is described as “a secondary task”). Nadia Bianchi-Berthouze and colleagues demonstrated that engagement in games (and human computer interaction) could lead to either increased movement or decreased movement, depending on the motivational nature of movement tasks involved with the accomplishment of the task. Harry Witchel and colleagues named the inhibitory phenomenon as NIMI, and demonstrated that the visual aspect of the human-computer interaction task was the most powerful contributor to the inhibitory effect on movement. They also demonstrated that, during individual human computer interaction in instrumentally identical reading comprehension tasks, interest itself was sufficient to diminish movement. This was reflected in experiments by Patrick Healy and colleagues in a seated audience at a dance performance.  Controversy  While it is known that frustration and restlessness can lead to increased movement during human computer interaction, it remains controversial as to whether NIMI that occurs during engagement is actually an inhibition of a baseline amount of physiologically required movement.

It was based in Knin, the capital of breakaway SAO Krajina that became the Republic of Serb Krajina (RSK). It was led by Serbian- Australian Dragan Vasiljković (born 1954), known as \\"Captain Dragan\\". It was one of several notable Serb paramilitary units, alongside the White Eagles, Arkan's Tigers, the Falcons, and others. Vasiljković, who had served in the Australian army, had returned to Yugoslavia in 1990 during the Croatian independence movement, eventually being hired as an instructor for volunteers in the summer of 1991. At this time, Belgrade daily Politika published a comic book named The Demons Return that featured the Kninjas fighting the Croats with martial arts. The unit, deemed elite, was the special unit of Knin police chief Milan Martić. According to Martić himself, he was supplied of equipment and weapons mostly from the Serbian government. It became the special forces of the RSK Interior Ministry. The name, a pun on \\"Knin\\" and \\"Ninjas\\", was informal; the unit did not have an official name, but the term was used for the mostly Vasiljković-trained volunteers. Veterans later joined the Special Operations Unit of FR Yugoslavia. Vasiljković currently serves a 15-year prison sentence for war crimes. The emblem was a customized Serbian cross, with blue background and inverted firesteels.

It is a native delicacy in the Eastern Visayas region of the Philippines, particularly in the area around Tacloban City in the province of Leyte and in Eastern Samar province. Other parts of the Philippines have their versions of it, however. In fact, the moron was adopted as one of Mambajao, Camiguin's locally-produced products. Since it is a variety of suman, the moron is cooked with glutinous rice, coconut milk and sugar. The main difference is that moron is gyrated with chocolate tablea (tablets) or mixed with cocoa powder while a regular suman is not. It also has a hint of vanilla and is usually partnered with coffee or sikwate (a native Philippine chocolate drink). With chocolate as its distinct ingredient, it is also called chocolate moron.  Preparation  The common ingredients of moron consist of glutinous rice (locally known in Tagalog as malagkit and in the Eastern Visayas region as pilit), ordinary rice, coconut milk, sugar, chocolate or cocoa powder and melted butter. In preparation for cooking the malagkit and the ordinary rice, both rice types must be soaked together overnight and then ground the following day. The ground rice is then soaked in coconut milk until it is soft, after which sugar and chocolate powder are added. The mixture is cooked over low fire while repeatedly stirred. When the consistency is thick, the cooked mixture is set aside for it to cool. After the mixture cools, banana leaves are prepared and cut to be used as wrappers. The recommended amount is two tablespoons of the mixture per banana leaf. The moron is then brushed with butter. After wrapping, both ends of the banana leaf are tied with string. Lastly, the moron are steamed for about half an hour. After the moron is cooled, it can now be served.  Consumption  Moron is usually sold in bundles of four pieces that are individually wrapped in a banana leaf. Tourists from Leyte usually buy moron as a pasalubong or gift for their relatives and friends. In the places where moron originated, it is usually served at festivals, birthday parties, and funeral wakes. Visitors from those parties usually takes home some of the moron. The food is also a medium of exchange for goodwill in Tacloban and the nearby municipalities of Palo, Tanauan, Tolosa, Dulag, Mayorga and Abuyog. Philippine government agencies usually promote and support locally produced goods such as the moron. The Department of Science and Technology of the Philippines advocated the longer shelf life of food products including the moron to help producers of those kind of food products while the Department of Trade and Industry of the Philippines conducted trade fairs to develop and promote products, which included the moron. The Department of Labor and Employment of the Philippines meanwhile made a project in Mambujao, Camiguin for the production of moron.

Moore–Albert E. Sleeper House was built as a private house located, at 7277 Simons Street in Lexington, Michigan, and was the residence and later summer home of Michigan governor Albert E. Sleeper. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. The house is now a bed and breakfast, known as A Captain's Quarters Inn. History Charles H. Moore was born in 1824 in Bath, New Hampshire. He married Sophia Hodges in 1848, and moved to Ohio in 1850. By 1854, the couple had resettled in Lexington and purchased a farm; in addition, Charles performed carpentry work in the area. The moved proved prosperous, and in 1856 the couple purchased three lots in Lexington where this house now stands. They built this house in about 1860. Charles Moore was active in the village, entering into business with J.L. Woods and Company, a general merchandising firm, and serving as a member of the local volunteer fire department and as a Trustee on the Village Council. In 1901, Moore's youngest daughter, Mary, married Albert E. Sleeper. Sleeper was born in Bradford, Vermont, in 1862, and moved to Lexington in 1884. He worked as a merchant, and then founded a series of local banks in Yale, Bad Axe, Marlette, Ubly, Applegate, and Lexington. By the 1890s, he started in politics, serving as Lexington Village President. After his marriage to Mary Moore, Sleeper was elected to the state legislature. He later served as state treasurer, and in 1916 was elected as Governor of Michigan, serving until 1920. The Sleepers moved their permanent residence to Bad Axe in 1904, but maintained this house in Lexington as a summer residence until Albert Sleeper's death in 1934. The family sold the house soon afterward. The house was used as a single-family home until 1983, when it was refurbished as a bed and breakfast, known at that time as the \\"Governor's Inn.\\" The bed and breakfast has been operated under a number of different innkeepers, and as of 2017 is operated as \\"A Captain's Quarters Inn.\\" Description The house is a two-story, wood-framed structure sheathed with clapboard. The massing and steeply pitched roof reflect a Vernacular Gothic Revival sensibility in the design of the original home. Later decorative elements of Queen Anne style were added to the house, including curved brackets and turned ornaments. The front facade is three bays wide with a double entry door in the left bay, and floor-to-ceiling window/doors in the center and right bays.

It is located along the road that links Basra to Amarah, a mere 40 km away. Qalat Saleh’s nearest towns are the district centres of Al-Majar Al Kabeer (20 km north-west), Al Kahlaa (17 km north), and Al Azeer (29 km south). The town is surrounded by agricultural villages and rural communities: Sulaymaniyah village; Abu Samih village and Beit Khaled village. History Qal'at Saleh, formerly known as \\"Shatra Al- Amarah\\", was named after \\"Saleh Suleiman Al-Najdi\\", an Arab officer from Najd, who was appointed by the Ottomans to collect tribute from the rebellious local tribes. In 1866, once the Ottoman troops managed to restrain the rebels, Saleh built a mud fortress () to maintain control of the region. The settlement attracted more and more residents and expanded over time around the fortress, which was later destroyed. By the 1920s, Qalat Saleh was a small town developed on both sides of the Karma canal. In the mid-1930s, the canal dried out and became the town’s main commercial axis, Karma Street, along which once could find traders, gold and silver jewelers, carpenters and blacksmiths. At the time, the town comprised five neighborhoods: Al-Amir, Ghadir, Karama, Al Shuhada and Zahra. A few typical timber-latticed shanasheel buildings are still standing – albeit in poor conditions. The great Mosque of Qalat Saleh, built in 1868 during the Ottoman Empire, is one of the town’s most significant heritage landmarks. Most visitors come to the area to pay a visit to the shrine of Imam Abdullah bin Ali, located 10 km south of the town. Not far from Qalat Saleh is another of Maysan’s famous attractions, the Tomb of Ezra (Prophet Uzayr) and its adjacent old synagogue located in Al Uzair, on the western bank of the Tigris, popularly believed to be the burial place of the biblical figure Ezra, the scribe of the Old Testament. Due to frequent embellishment works, not much of the original Ottoman period shrine has been preserved. Demographics The town is mostly Shia, but it has a sizable Mandaean and previously Jewish community. As many smaller rural towns in Iraq, dependent on an agrarian economy, Qalat Saleh is experiencing the inexorable population movements towards regional economic magnets. Since the mid-1950s, many families migrated to Amarah, Baghdad and Basra seeking better opportunities. Worsening living conditions and deprivation of the peasants, endemic diseases, neglected irrigation projects and increased salinity of the soil has over time reduced the productivity of agricultural land. Today, poor returns on agricultural activities is pushing farmers – particularly youth – to leave their land to seek work in towns and cities. In 2016, according to estimates of the Directorate of Planning, the town of Qalat Saleh was home to 37,958 inhabitants.COSIT Qalat Saleh municipality’s population estimates reach 40,000 inhabitants, with an average household size of 7.7 – which is higher than the national average.  Industries  The Municipality established a dedicated industrial area in the south of the city. By 2017, it was only partially developed.  Tourism and leisure activities  In July 2013, the Iraqi Council of Ministers approved the designation of the Central Marshes of Iraq as the country’s first National Park, as a joint effort by Iraq’s Ministry of Water Resources, Ministry of Environment, and Ministry of Municipalities with support from Nature Iraq, and Iraqi environmental conservation organization. Despite expectations, the planned National Park has not yet been approved by the Council of Ministers. In January 2014, the ‘Ahwar of Southern Iraq and the Relict Landscape of the Mesopotamian Cities’ was successfully nominated for inscription of the property on the World Heritage List. The nomination covers a vast area, spanning between the governorates of Al Muthanna, Dhi Qar and Maysan. It includes the Hawizeh and Central Marshes, that fall under the jurisdiction of Maysan governorate. Since the nomination, the marshes have seen a significant increase of local tourists, researchers and nature enthusiasts. Local inhabitants have benefited from this influx of visitors, offering thrilling excursion on motor boats or the traditional mashoof to visits to the uniquely designed al-mudhif, the traditional ceremonial spaces and reed houses. According to the local authorities, since 2016, the marshes have attracted some 150 visitors and tourists per month, but in peak winter and spring periods they can go up to 150 per week. Yet, gains from the tourism sector have been very limited because of the scarcity in local accommodation, poor accessibility, lack of information and/or organised tours.

He began writing Chinese in school, and continued throughout his life, but became especially prolific just before his death. His kanshi are well- regarded critically – in fact considered the best of the Meiji period – but are not as popular as his novels.  Beginnings  Natsume Sōseki first took up Chinese studies, specifically the composition of kanshi (poetry in Classical Chinese), in school.  Later works  Sōseki considered himself an amateur kanshi poet, and ignored the practices of the professional poets of his day. He included some Chinese poetry in his early novel Kusamakura, and he had continued to compose them throughout his life, but his most significant works come from the last months of his life, during the writing of Light and Darkness. He also composed haiku during this period, but he is considered a minor haiku poet while his kanshi have been widely praised. While writing Light and Darkness, he wrote the novel in the morning and kanshi in the afternoon, supposedly to keep himself oriented during the \\"vulgarizing\\" experience of writing the novel. His Chinese verse often did not meet the standard tonal patterns of classical Chinese verse, and his rhyming were sometimes wrong.  Reception  Sōseki's Chinese verse has been widely praised. Historically, Chinese poetry written by Japanese had been an exercise in following the rules of Chinese prosody but lacked poetic grace associated with the best poets from China; Sōseki's poems, on the other hand, are admired even by Chinese critics who dismiss traditional Japanese kanshi. Literary critic and historian Donald Keene called him \\"[probably] [t]he best kanshi poet of the Meiji era\\". He also noted that while Sōseki's kanshi are not as popular in contemporary Japan as his novels, this probably has more to do with the orientation of Japanese society since Sōseki's death in 1916 than with the actual literary value of the poems and novels in relation to each other.

History  The palace was an important place of political and commercial importance in South India, since Eraniel town was a seasonal capital of the Venad kingdom until the seventeenth century when Padmanabhapuram came into prominence. However, in the 21st century, only some modest glimpses of the old royal heritage of the historic Eraniel town can be found in the remains of the old palace (Thekkaethevan Koikkal), \\"its ornate granite pillars, some timber beams, decaying walls that seem ready to fall anytime soon, and the already collapsed roof.\\" thumb  Architecture  The present day Eraniel palace complex spreads over slightly more than three-and-one-half acres. However, it is mostly in dilapidated condition due to decades of neglect. Currently, only three identifiable parts of the palace remains: * the Padippura (:ml:പടിപ്പുര) or the majestic entrance gateway leading to the main palace (this is currently in total ruins) * the Kuthira malika (translation: Mansion of horses), the main area of the palace, that was a modest double storied courtyard house * the Vasantha mandapam (translation: Spring pavilion), a detached pavilion built on top of an elevated platform. It is replete with beautiful carvings. It is located on the western side of the palace complex. There used to be an ever burning lamp in the Vasanta mandapam, kept as a memorial to a miraculous incident that happened centuries ago, as documented by Emily Gilchriest Hatch, the author of Travancore – A Guide Book for the Visitor (1933). The palace compound also has a pond within, that was probably used by the royalty. Dressed granite blocks were used to perfectly line and bound the sides of this pond.  Restoration  The palace is owned by Government of Tamil Nadu but there is almost zero management or maintenance, that led to its present-day dilapidated condition. Although the Government had announced plans to reconstruct the complex and the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department has made estimates to invite tenders, the palace complex remains in ruins and uncared for.

Life Lidgett was born in Mile End in East London to John and Ann Lidgett in 1843. Her elder sister Mary married Percy Bunting. She was elected in April 1881 to be a Poor Law Guardian in St Pancras. Another guardian was Sarah Ward Andrews who had formed a group to encourage women to stand for these positions of responsibility. Elizabeth and her sister Mary were both inspired to good works by their membership of the Charity Organization Society. The Charity Organization Society was inspired to target work at the deserving poor whilst trying to avoid creating an expectation of dependency.(1887). \\"Lots of Chronic Paupers.\\" The Washington Post. 21 October 1887. At this stage women were being welcomed to serve in some public areas. They were helping to organise the workhouses for the poor and to supervise the process where children were \\"boarded out\\" and to help with schools serving the legal requirement to educate poor children. However it was apparent that women were expected to restrict themselves to these areas. For instance her sister was told by the male members of the Metropolitan Association for Befriending Young Servants that the women on the committee might assist with finding positions for female paupers. In November 1888 she and her sister Mary attended the first meeting of what would become the Women's Local Government Society at Sarah Amos's house. The group was led by Annie Leigh Browne and it was deciding suitable women candidates for election. Lidgett was offered the opportunity of standing to be a London County Councillor in 1889 but she refused. That same year she became involved in the management of the Gray's Inn Road schools. This was a position of some ambition as women were allowed to serve on school boards many years before they were given equal electoral rights in 1928. Lidgett worked with Florence Davenport Hill. Lidgett was a Poor Law Guardian in St Pancras for nearly forty years and she continued always to support the Women's Local Government Society.

Biography Ugra's autobiography, Apni Khabar, gives a graphic account of his early life. Ugra was born into the very poor Brahmin family of Vaidyanath Pandey. Several of his siblings had died young, and his name Bechan means 'sold', given to him to avert this misfortune. Vaidyanath died when Ugra was a baby; the family suffered abuse from one of Ugra's two older brothers; and the children received only a patchy education. From about the age of eight Ugra followed in his brothers' footsteps in performing in the theatrical genre known as Ramlila, and his brother sent him to work in the theatre in Banaras, before taking him on tour as a child actor and as his servant.Ruth Vanita, 'Introduction', in Pandey Bechan Sharma 'Ugra', ‘Chocolate’, and Other Writings on Male-male Desire, trans. by Ruth Vanita (New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2006), pp. 1–36 (p. 21). Ugra devoted much of his energy to editing newspapers and magazines, though most were short-lived.Ruth Vanita, ‘The New Homophobia: Ugra's Chocolate’, in Same- Sex Love in India: Readings from Literature and History, ed. by Ruth Vanita and Saleem Kidwai (Basingstoke: Macmillan, 2000), pp. 246–52 (p. 246). In 1924, he was imprisoned for nine months for editing the first issue of the newspaper Swadesh, opposing British rule: fleeing from Gorakhpur, he sought refuge first in Calcutta and then Bombay, where he was arrested.Ruth Vanita, 'Introduction', in Pandey Bechan Sharma 'Ugra', ‘Chocolate’ and Other Writings on Male Homoeroticism, trans. by Ruth Vanita (Durham: Duke University Press, 2009), p. xix.Ramesh Chandra Shah, 'Ugra', in Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: Sasay to Zorgot, ed. by Mohan Lal (New Delhi: Sahitya Akademi, 1992), pp. 4422–23 (p. 4423). Upon release, he returned to Calcutta, editing the magazine Matvala until the 1928 controversy over his short-story collection Choklat, which led him to move to Bombay to work on silent films. Later, hounded by creditors, he moved to Indore, where he edited Vina and Swarajya. After getting into trouble there, he moved to Ujjain, where he edited Vikram. Finally, he settled in Delhi, where he died in 1967. He never married. Themes and style Like most contemporary Indian writers, Ugra was committed to promoting both social reform and Indian independence from the British Empire.Ruth Vanita, 'Introduction', in Pandey Bechan Sharma 'Ugra', ‘Chocolate’ and Other Writings on Male Homoeroticism, trans. by Ruth Vanita (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2009), p. xv. In the words of Ruth Vanita, \\"he delighted in iconoclasm; few writers of the time match his unsentimental depictions of the family, whether urban or rural, as a hotbed of violence, neglect, hatred, sexual depravity, and oppression\\";Ruth Vanita, 'Introduction', in Pandey Bechan Sharma 'Ugra', ‘Chocolate’ and Other Writings on Male Homoeroticism, trans. by Ruth Vanita (Durham: Duke University Press, 2009), pp. xvii-xviii. \\"his fiction tends toward the didactic and generally has a social message. His writings champion the causes of nationalism, oppressed women, and lower castes, and critique corruption in high places, alcoholism, gambling, adultery, prostitution, and communalism.\\" His language straddled the conventions of Hindi and Urdu, in line with Gandhi's promotion of a unitary Indian language of 'Hindustani',Ruth Vanita, 'Introduction', in Pandey Bechan Sharma 'Ugra', ‘Chocolate’ and Other Writings on Male Homoeroticism, trans. by Ruth Vanita (Durham: Duke University Press, 2009), p. xvi. and often included profane and colloquial language that had fallen from fashion in Indian writing during the Victorian period.Ruth Vanita, 'Introduction', in Pandey Bechan Sharma 'Ugra', ‘Chocolate’ and Other Writings on Male Homoeroticism, trans. by Ruth Vanita (Durham: Duke University Press, 2009), pp. xvii. Publications on homosexuality Ugra is particularly noted in Anglophone scholarship for his unusual willingness to discuss male homosexuality in his work.Saurav Kumar Rai, 'Colonial Archives, Vernacular Literature and the History of Homosexual Relationships in Colonial India', Jigyasa, 6.3 (September 2013), 266-71. This contrasted with a tendency in India under British rule to downplay the existence of homosexuality. His first piece to do so, \\"Choklat\\" (\\"Chocolate\\") was published on 21 May 1924 in the magazine Matvala (\\"Intoxicated\\"). The story describes an illicit sexual relationship between Babu Dinkar Prasad, an upper-class Hindu man, and \\"a beautiful lad of thirteen of fourteen.\\" Babu Dinkar Prasad is presented as a predatory character, forcing himself on young teenage boys and corrupting them with his homosexuality. The title of the story refers to \\"a name for those innocent, tender and beautiful boys of our country, whom society’s demons push into the mouth of destruction to quench their own desires.\\" \\"Choklat\\" was a sensation, eliciting polarized responses upon publication. Encouraged by the scandal he provoked, Ugra proceeded to publish a further four stories on the same theme over the next few months, and gathered them together in October 1927 with three more stories and other preparatory materials as a collection entitled Choklat. Ugra claimed that his representations of homoeroticism were intended to reveal and hence eradicate Indian homosexuality. Some readers, including M.K. Gandhi, concluded that Choklat was indeed acceptable because it warned against the dangers of homosexuality. However, many readers were scandalised that Ugra had discussed homosexuality at all, believing that by doing so doing so, he was promoting it. Fellow nationalist Pandit Banarsidas Chaturvedi labelled Ugra's work as Ghasleti literature - that is, literature that relied on obscenity and scandal to appeal to readers. Alongside critics \\"were some homosexual men who were happy to find any representation of their lives, even a negative one.\\" The first edition of Choklat sold out swiftly, leading to a second edition, which sold out within six weeks of the publication of the first,Charu Gupta, 'Dirty Hindi Literature: Contests About Obscenity in Late Colonial North India', South Asia Research, 20 (2000), 89-118 (p. 115). followed by a third in 1953.Calcutta: Tandon Brothers, 1953.

One of the most prominent examples for those painting manuals was the Mustard Seed Garden (, Jieziyuan Huazhuan) manual of painting. Description With Chinese influence, Korean peninsula’s painting originated during the Three Kingdoms period in the form of mural painting. It eventually developed into monochrome painting or light painting. Naturalistic themes became popular subjects for Korean painting.

Phytobacter is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria emerging from the grouping of isolates previously assigned to various genera of the family Enterobacteriaceae. This genus was first established on the basis of nitrogen fixing isolates from wild rice in China, but also includes a number of isolates obtained during a 2013 multi- state sepsis outbreak in Brazil and, retrospectively, several clinical strains isolated in the 1970s in the United States that are still available in culture collections, which originally were grouped into Brenner's biotype XII. Standard biochemical evaluation panels are lacking Phytobacter spp. from their database, thus often leading to misidentifications with other Enterobacterales species, especially Pantoea agglomerans. Clinical isolates of the species have been identified as an important source of extended-spectrum β-lactamase and carbapenem-resistance genes, which are usually mediated by genetic mobile elements. Strong protection of co-infecting sensitive bacteria has also been reported. Bacteria belonging to this genus are not pigmented, chemoorganotrophic and able to fix nitrogen. They are lactose fermenting, cytochrome-oxidase negative and catalase positive. Glucose is fermented with the production of gas. Colonies growing on MacConkey agar (MAC) are circular, convex and smooth with non-entire margins and an usually elevated center. Three species are currently validly included in the genus Phytobacter, which is still included within the Kosakonia clade in the lately reviewed family of Enterobacteriaceae. The incorporation of a fourth species, Phytobacter massiliensis, has recently been proposed via the unification of the genera Metakosakonia and Phytobacter.  Species  *Phytobacter diazotrophicus is the most common Phytobacter species recovered from the environment and humans and is an opportunistic pathogen associated with contaminated catheters or the use of total parenteral nutrition. * Phytobacter ursingii can biochemically be differentiated from Phytobacter diazotrophicus on the basis of its ability to metabolize d-serine and l-sorbose. Despite the presence of nitrogen-fixation genes suggests an environmental origin, only clinical isolates of the species have been reported so far. *Phytobacter palmae is a species with high nitrogen fixing ability that was first identified in Singapore in leaf tissues of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis). *Phytobacter massiliensis, whose type strain JC163T was isolated from the fecal flora of a healthy Senegalese patient.

It is endemic to Greece. Description It is a small fish with a total length of 3–7 cm. The lateral line has around 40 scales which run from the angle of the bladder slit to the base of the tail, only the first 8-12 of these scales are perforated, forming the true lateral line. The dorsal fin has3 simple and 7-8 branching rays. The tail is forked. The colour of the body is greyish-brown, pale on the ventral side with a narrow, longitudinal black band on the flanks. Distribution The Marathon minnow is endemic to Greece where it can be found in the drainages of the Spercheios and Boeotian Kifissos Rivers and on the Marathon Plain. It had been recorded from the Athenian Kifissos but not since 1971 but it was rediscovered there in 2013. It has also been found in the Xerias River near Argos. Habitat and ecology The Marathon minnow is found in Springs, swamps, canals; normally among vegetation or under banks or in tree roots. It lives up to two years. Spawns in May–September and is a fractional spawner like other minnows in the genus Pelasgus. It feeds on a wide variety of aquatic invertebrates, algae and detritus. Conservation The population in the Marathon area has been seriously affected by drainage for agriculture while other threats include Water abstraction, drought, agricultural pollution and introduced species such as the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and the mosquito-fish (Gambusia holbrooki), The habitat of this species should continue to be monitored, the spread of Gambusia halted using biological control and populations of Marathon minnow should be reinforcedusing captively bred fish. A major publicity campaign for schools and environmental agencies to raise public awareness has been suggested.

Tea brewed from the roots of the prairie dock have a variety of medical applications in Native American culture. The smoke from this plant has also been used as a treatment for congestion and rheumatism. Description Silphium terebinthinaceum is an herbaceous perennial growing tall. Prairie dock produces small yellow flowers about in diameter in the summer. The leaves are rough-textured, spade-shaped, and oriented vertically and in a north-south direction, providing special adaptations for survival in the prairie climate. One study found that the majority of prairie dock's leaves were oriented within 15° of North as well as 60° away from the horizontal. The combination of north-south and vertical arrangement seems to provide a mechanism for maintaining lower leaf temperatures at midday, thus conserving water. Additionally, this unique trait grants the plant better access to sunlight for photosynthesis, and consequently provides a more efficient method of producing its carbon resource. This dicot also has a characteristically large taproot able to penetrate to depths of at least in search of the water table. Distribution Silphium terebinthinaceum flower Silphium terebinthinaceum is native to most of Illinois, northwestern Indiana, southern parts of Michigan, southern parts of Wisconsin, and parts of Missouri. The habitats of S. terebinthinaceum include black soil prairies as well as gravel, shrub, and hill prairies. It also prefers to grow alongside roads and railroads. Cultivation Silphium terebinthinaceum prefers full sun. S. terebinthinaceum is a drought-resistant plant that thrives in slightly dry to moist environments. While S. terebinthinaceum prefers deep loamy soils, it is tolerant of soils with gravel and rocks. The plant is slow at developing but is strong and difficult to kill when it is mature. Even though it is a robust plant, harsh conditions may still affect this plant. When there is a drought, a windstorm, or damage to the leaves of the S. terebinthinaceum, patches of brown can develop. Recovery after wildfires occurs quickly, as it has a very deep taproot. Ecology Silphium terebinthinaceum can survive destructive events such as grazing and soil degradation because of its ability to produce new above-ground shoots. This plant is also well adapted to obtain and hold onto water due to its characteristically large taproot and large, particularly oriented leaves. Native bees nest beneath or within these plants or use elements of the plants for their nests. Consequently, they are thought to be an important species for attracting bees for pollination in the area. Prairie dock is one of the few species that successfully persists on land that has been converted from prairie to railway. Medicinal uses Like Silphium perfoliatum (cup plant), S. terebinthinaceum is used as a tea to relieve lung bleeding, to minimize menstruation bleeding, and as an emetic by Native Americans. Other root tea uses include a treatment for liver issues, fever, and enlarged spleen. The smoke from this plant is used as a treatment for nerve pain, along with relieving congestion and rheumatism. However, this plant is considered potentially toxic.

St. Petersburg, 1912 Scripophily.ru Ancient Russian Securities Share warrant The Lena Goldfields, Limited. 1910Scripophily.ru Ancient Russian Securities In 1855, two merchants, Pavel Basnin and Petr Katyshevtsev, members of the top guild and honorary citizens of Irkutsk, founded the Lena Gold Mining Partnership. By the beginning of the 1870s, Evzel Gintsburg and the Meyer & Co trading house had begun accumulating shares of the mining partnership. In 1882, the Gintsburg dynasty – headed by father Evzel (Osip) Gabrielovich Gintsburg (1812–1878) and his son Horace (1833–1909) – started to dominate the gold trade in the Lena River region.«Commerce in Russian Urban Culture, 1861–1914». Edited by William Craft Brumfield, Boris V. Anan’ich, and Yuri A. Petrov. P. 14. Layout of the Lena's Goldfields., Ltd. mines. 1912 History The Gintsburgs and the State Bank were respectively the company's largest and second-largest shareholders. The other shareholders were the Tsar's ministers Witte, Timashev and Timiryazev, and even Empress Maria Fedorovna. With such an influential team of owners, obtaining credit from the state was not a complicated undertaking; thus, the Lena partnership developed rapidly. =Seizures= Still not satisfied, however, the Gintsburgs began a massive seizure of neighbouring territories. The company willingly engaged in legal battles, first with the individual owners of the gold mines and then with the companies themselves. Even though gold mining is an inherently risky business, Horace Gintsburg retained gold mines for many years \\"just in case\\", hoping one day to uncover hidden wealth and precious surprises\\". Thereafter, the Lena partnership's search for capital followed a dual pathway. After 1896, the partnership was reorganized as a joint-stock company with nominal capital of 4.5 million gold rubles. A year later, additional shares amounting to 1.5 million gold rubles were issued; but the gold mines required still more millions, prompting Gintsburg to pursue a larger credit facility on the Russian financial market. The free trading of gold was prohibited, leaving the Russian State Bank as the sole exclusive purchaser of gold. While the Tsar's government had always shown great interest in accumulating gold, its enthusiasm for mining the metal especially increased in the 1890s due to financial reforms implemented by Russian finance minister S.Y. Witte and the introduction of the gold currency. After 1902, owing to the connections of Gintsburg, the Lena partnership found itself in a unique position. The State Bank extended it an unlimited long-term line of credit amounting to 6–7 million rubles. One of the bank's directors N.I. Boyanovskiy was included in the partnership's board of directors to exert a measure of financial control, and I.N. Belozerov, a protege of the State Bank, was appointed as chief manager of the mines. In supplying the Lena partnership with money, the Bank was interested not so much in earning a profit as in solidifying the gold- mining industry as a foundation of the state financial system. Gintsburg and the other shareholders, on the contrary, were keen to capitalize on profit and to receive the maximum possible dividends; therefore, a decision was made whereby the partnership had to become independent from the bank and search for a more cooperative lender.The Free-standing Company in the World Economy, 1830–1996.(edited by Mira Wilkins and Harm G. Schröter) pp. 182–183 In 1907—1908, such a lender was easily found in London, where a group of English financiers headed by Lord Harris, a participant in gold mining enterprises in America and Africa, had become interested in Russian gold. A special joint- stock company, Lena Goldfields, was formed with nominal capital of 1,405,000 pounds sterling. The English financiers considered Lena Goldfields to be an instrument for speculating in the financial market, a philosophy that soon yielded results. Lena's shares began being quoted on the St. Petersburg exchange in 1905, however it was not until 1908 that they exceeded their nominal value. From the moment they passed into English hands, the Lena shares \\"had a dazzling career\\". In 1909, their value increased to 1,850 rubles, reaching in 1910 a colossal value of 6,075 rubles! The fabulous and unprecedented growth of Lena shares was achieved using a comprehensive system of stock exchange manipulation, including payoffs to both the yellow and mainstream press, stockbrokers, questionable banks, and so on. =Strike and massacre= However, news of a strike at the mines and the ensuing tragic Lena massacre soon spread through the stock exchange and would have a dramatic negative impact on the company's fortunes. On 4 (17) April 1912, more than two thousand Lena Goldfields employees staged a demonstration. Initially, the demonstration was peaceful, but the leader of the gendarme cavalry Captain Treshenkov ordered his soldiers to open fire on the workers. Two hundred seventy people were killed and 250 were wounded.1912.LENA MASSACRE.105th Anniversary of tragic events at Lena goldfieldsLibcom.org  The Lena massacre, 1912 – Sam Lowry =Nationalization= In the aftermath of the massacre, Lena shares fell dramatically, creating a decisive moment in the company's history. In the summer of 1914, the company began discussions about acquiring new equipment and dredges, the first of which was not ordered until 1917. Its manufacture, shipping from the United States, assembly and installation should have taken one and a half or two years, but, at the time of October Revolution, the dredge was only in the process of shipping. On 28 June 1918, the Council of People's Commissars issued a decree on the nationalization of a number of enterprises, among which was Lena Goldfields.

She is a professor at the University of Lyon 1 and has been a chevalier of the Ordre des Palmes Académiques since 2015. As the director of a research team at the Lyon Institut de Physique des 2 Infinis (IP2I)—formerly the Institute of Nuclear Physics (IPNL)—and co-director of two international teams (Cosmic Flows and CLUES), she is best known for her investigations into the dynamic cosmography of the Universe. Her work has concentrated on the distribution of matter in the large-scale structure of the Universe. In 2006, she participated in the confirmation of the acceleration in the expansion of the Universe via the study of supernovae. In 2014, she proposed a redefinition of the notion of galactic superclusters, and identified the Laniakea Supercluster, an agglomeration that is bigger than the Virgo Supercluster by a factor of 100. In 2017, she showed that cosmic voids produce a repulsive effect resulting in galactic displacements; this may also explain the cold spot in the cosmic microwave background. Biography Hélène Di Nella was born in 1970. She obtained a PhD (doctorate) from the University of Grenoble 1 in 1995, with her thesis titled Structure et cinématique de l'univers local. Career =Research work= Courtois began her research into the large- scale structure of our cosmic neighbourhood in the early 1990s while at the Lyon Observatory. In 1994, she revealed a superstructure comprising 27,000 galaxies, with a radius of about 290 million light-years. By studying the distribution of thousands of galaxies and modelling their structures, her team showed that these galaxies were not spherically distributed in space, but instead created a shape like a squashed football or a silkworm cocoon. Courtois and her team have studied the convergent behaviour of the galaxies of the Laniakea supercluster. By modelling the movement of galaxies as though they were streams in a watershed or basin, they were able to map out the boundaries of this local agglomeration. They have adapted the technique to model the Vela Supercluster, which was discovered in 2016. They used their data to compute the flow rate of the galaxies towards the 'centre', thereby making it possible to infer the masses of the galaxies. Using this information, they will be able to determine the shape and size of the Vela supercluster. In 2017, Courtois revealed two discoveries: one, called the Dipole repeller, and the other, on the cosmic microwave background cold spot, which could potentially explain the propagation of our galaxy through space at about 2 million kilometres per hour. In 2019, her team released a new map of the local universe, encompassing a volume 10 times larger than that released in 2014. =Scientific administration= In the 2000s, Courtois led the cosmology team at the Lyon Observatory. In 2006, she set up the research programme Cosmic Flows. Its major result has been the discovery of the frontiers of the supercluster named Laniakea that defines our cosmic neighbourhood. Since 2013, she has been the head of the IP2I Observational Cosmology / Euclid research group. It is one of the world leaders in the field of cosmology dedicated to the observation, analysis and digital reproduction of the distribution and dynamics of dark matter and galaxies in the nearby universe. Courtois oversaw the creation of a comprehensive programme of university studies in the sciences of the universe, hosting annually more than 500 students from University of Lyon 1. Courtois has been an expert adviser at the European Commission for research and education programmes in physics and astrophysics since 2009. She is also a patron of the Vaulx-en-Velin planetarium. Honours In 2015, Courtois was named a senior member of the Institut Universitaire de France and was made a chevalier of the Ordre des Palmes Académiques. She also received a festival prize for her film Cartographier l'univers : à la découverte de Laniakea. In 2016, she became a vice-president of the University of Lyon 1, responsible for international relations. Her book Voyage sur les flots de galaxies won the 2017 Prix Ciel & Espace du livre d'astronomie. In 2017, she was ranked in the top 50 most influential French personalities by Vanity Fair. In 2018, she received the \\"Eureka\\" prize for science communication. She was also elected as the most influential French Scientist of the year by the Foreign affairs ministry. In 2019, she was nominated in the top 3 of the 50 most influential women in her home city, Lyon. On 1 January 2020, Courtois was made a Chevalier of the Légion d'honneur.

Molefe was appointed as the CEO of Transnet in February 2011, and as the CEO of Eskom in April 2015. In November 2016 he left Eskom after being implicated in Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's state capture report. The Public Protector report did not have any findings of wrongdoing by Molefe however, it was alleged that Molefe and Ajay Gupta, the eldest of the Gupta brothers, had made 58 telephone calls to one another between August 2015 and March 2016. Due to public pressure following the public protector report, Molefe resigned from Eskom. On resigning, Molefe became further embroiled in controversy when he was illegally awarded a large pension fund payout by the Eskom pension fund. He previously also led the Public Investment Corporation. During his tenure as the CEO on the Public Investments Corporation from 2003 to 2008, he oversaw a growth in assets under management from R300bn to R900bn. He introduced shareholder activism at the PIC and advocated for the transformation of the South African Corporate sector to be more inclusive and representative of indigenous South Africans who had suffered under the policy of apartheid. He has also held the position of Deputy Director General at the National Treasury responsible for Assets and Liabilities Management. In this position, he was responsible for, amongst others, the management of sovereign debt. He oversaw a fundamental restructuring of South Africa’s domestic and foreign debt portfolio between 2000 and 2003. In January 2017 Molefe was sworn in as a member of Parliament. He resigned from the legislature in May 2017 to deal with the allegations of his pension payout. Molefe is a Colonel in the South African Army Reserves. He has previously served as Honorary Colonel in the then South African Irish Regiment. The name of the regiment has since been changed to the Andrew Mlangeni Infantry Regiment of the South African Army. The regiment is part of the Reserve Force. Controversy Due to numerous irregularities during Molefe’s time at the helm of State Owned Enterprises Eskom and Transnet, as well as his known close relationship with the controversial Gupta Family, Molefe has been implicated in state capture at the Zondo Commission of Inquiry and stands accused of corruption, money-laundering and racketeering. The Gauteng North High Court ordered Molefe to repay an amount of R10.3m, which he was not entitled to as per a retirement agreement. He unsuccessfully appealed this ruling to the SCA and the Constitutional Court. After the Constitutional Court bid had failed, the Eskom Pension Fund launched a court application in which it sought to have the R10.3m judgment enforced. Transnet seeks near R80 million against Molefe in a lawsuit due to 'dubious dealings and malfeasance connected to state capture'. He is currently under investigation by The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) and the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). On 3 August 2020 Eskom and the SIU (Special Investigating Unit) issued summons against Brian Molefe and the controversial Gupta brothers in a bid to reclaim R3.8 Billion in which Molefe is implicated. Eskom suffered the aforementioned damages due to funds being illegally redirected from Eskom to Gupta family entities. A total of seven charges are brought against Molefe.

It was inaugurated by the king Mohammed VI in 2009 to reshape the national sport in Morocco.  Foundation and development  = Background = The project follows a series of programmes established by Mohammed VI and his advisors to ensure the development of Morocco. This project was inspired by the lack of sports facilities and shortage of talented footballers in the country. In this case, the construction of a football academy was planned to promote sports in Morocco and produce the next generation of footballers. = Objectives = This project was conceived to attain certain objectives including: * Finding young talents across the country * Targeting underprivileged areas in Rabat * Implementing a Sport-Study curriculum * Developing the national Football field * Preparing junior footballers for professional leagues = Foundation = In 2007, the Moroccan monarch instructed Groupe 3 Architectes to build a football academy in Sala Al Jadida. The project costed around MAD140 million. In the beginning, project manager Nasser Larguet toured the country to find adequate candidates. Afterwards, the academy started a testing system to accept students. The North-African Academy is managed by Compagnie Générale Immobilière, a non-profit organization. The academy is presided by the personal royal secretary of King Mohamed VI, Mounir El Majidi, who is also the head of FUS Rabat. King Mohamed VI supported the project by presenting financial aids to encourage similar initiatives in other cities and to guarantee the progress of Football activities in the country. In March 2010, King Mohammed VI inaugurated the academy which aims to provide education, mentoring and football training for its students. The Academy opened its doors in September 2010. It is destined for around 50 candidates aged between 13 and 18 years old. This educational sports facility is financially supported by personal funding from the king. It has also received a part of private investments from ONA, Maroc Télécom, Addoha, BMCE, CDG and AttijariWafa bank. In 2015, similar academies were launched in several cities across Morocco such as Agadir, Tangier, Saïdia...  Structure  The Academy is located near the Bouregreg river and it covers the area of 2.5 km². It is composed of two main areas: The open space (playing fields, and outdoor space for other activities) and a village. The academy is built to be a modern facility that encloses Moroccan cultural heritage. It is arranged to follow the shape of a traditional douar, with a central village square surrounded by five buildings.

Mix is an American developmental psychologist known for her research on the development of numerical concepts and their origins in infancy and toddlerhood. She is Professor and Chair of the Department of Human Development and Quantitative Methodology at the University of Maryland. Mix was awarded the Boyd McCandless Early Career Award (American Psychological Association, Division 7) in 2002 for her innovative research on the early emergence of numerocity. Her co-authored book Quantitative Development in Infancy and Early Childhood, with Janellen Huttenlocher and Susan Cohen Levine, provides an overview of the early development of quantitative reasoning and mathematical concepts. Her co-edited book The Spatial Foundations of Language and Cognition, with Linda B. Smith and Michael Gasser, examines the role of space in structuring human cognition.  Biography  Mix obtained her B.A. degree in Elementary Education from Western Michigan University in 1987, and worked as an elementary school teacher for several years before returning to school to pursue advanced degrees in Developmental Psychology. She obtained her M.A. in 1993 and her Ph.D. in 1995 at the University of Chicago, working under the supervision of Professor Janellen Huttenlocher. Mix served as an Assistant Professor/Associate Professor of Psychology at Indiana University from 1996–2005. She was an Associate Professor/Full Professor of Educational Psychology at Michigan State University from 2005–2016. She has worked in the College of Education at the University of Maryland since 2016.  Research  Mix is known for her cognitive developmental research on number concepts, mathematical reasoning, and symbol grounding. In her book with Huttenlocher and Levine, which focused on quantitative development in infancy through the preschool years, Mix put forth the view that infants begin life without an understanding of discrete numbers, yet are capable of distinguishing and representing quantitative amounts. In her research on the emergence of number concepts prior to formal schooling, Mix emphasizes how preschool children exhibit verbal skills, such as counting, and basic mathematical concepts of equivalence, ordinality, quantitative transformation, and place value prior to instruction. Other research has tested interventions aimed at improving children's mathematical reasoning skills. In Number Versus Contour Length in Infants' Discrimination of Small Visual Sets, Clearfield and Mix used a visual habituation paradigm to examine infants' use of length as a cue to quantity in a number discrimination task. Infants (6- to 8-month-olds) were habituated to displays consisting of two or three black squares. They were then tested with displays that had either the same number of squares but arranged differently (novel length) or a different number of squares arranged to have the same length as the original displays (novel number). Infants dishabituated to the novel length displays, but not to the novel number displays. The authors concluded that infants based their discriminations on the length of the displays, rather than on number of objects. In Spatial Training Improves Children's Mathematics Ability, Cheng and Mix tested whether mental rotation training improved math performance in 6- to 8-year-olds. Children were given various mathematical problems as a pretest. One group of children were given training on a mental rotation task that had been shown to improve spatial ability, while a control group of children completed crossword puzzles. Post- test scores indicated that children who received training on mental rotation showed significant improvements in solving math problems (missing term problems, such as 6 + ____ = 14), whereas the control group did not. These and other related findings indicating that spatial thinking is critical to mathematical thinking were cited in a policy report by the Ontario Ministry of Education.

Tucker's former teaching positions includes the University of Florida, Gainesville (1980-1986), Wayne State University (1986-1989), Auburn University (1989-1999), and University of Alabama at Birmingham (2000-2014). She was a visiting scholar of the Addictive Behaviors Research Center and Department of Psychology at the University of Washington in 1994. Tucker lectures on topics such as stress reduction being a determinant of alcohol usage, historical and contemporary trends of alcohol usage, and alcohol use as a self handicapping strategy. Tucker has received numerous grants for projects including the CITY Health II Project, Time Horizons and the Behavioral Economics of Recovery from Drinking Problems, and the Recovery and Health Seeking Processes in Problem Drinkers.  Research  Tucker and her colleagues have studied the effect of the environment on recovery from alcohol misuse and relapse. In one study, she compared individuals who had abstained from alcohol for an average of six years with those who were still active drinkers; in both groups, none of the individuals had received any treatment for substance use. Through interviews, Tucker concluded that individuals who recovered from alcohol misuse had not experienced as many negative events as their peers who had relapsed. In another study examining the relationship between social circumstances and substance abuse, Tucker and colleagues recruited 344 adolescent and young adult residents of low-income neighborhoods in Birmingham, Alabama. They examined the influence of peer pressure by assessing impact of the social network on participants' substance use. The findings confirmed that people who were encouraged by friends and family to use substances had a higher usage rate than those who were discouraged. This is significant because it confirms the importance of social and environmental factors on a person's decisions, especially for individuals transitioning into adulthood. Tucker's research implies that low-income communities are in need of more prevention programs. She also seeks out further research regarding young adults and their substance use in these areas. Tucker's work has drawn attention to the positive and negative influences that society can have on a person's substance use. By concluding that society's messages can either help or harm a person, Tucker introduces the need for societal discouragement and better prevention programs to lead people in the right direction. Her work on alcoholic recovery and relapse prevention culminated into a book co-edited with Dennis M. Donovan and G. Alan Marlatt titled Changing Addictive Behavior. In this work, the authors present alternative therapeutic treatments for those with mild or moderate alcoholism, suggesting that the clinical approach does not work for all people. They proposed that individualized treatments are necessary for recovery, as mild to moderate cases of addiction may not warrant the extensive, and usually more costly, treatment that more severe cases do. This suggestion was also made in her co-authored book with Diane Grimley, Public Health Tools for Practicing Psychologists, which proposed techniques to heighten the effectiveness of clinical care. The authors suggest that psychological care must be improved upon to become more individualized to each patient's needs.  Representative Publications  * George, A. A., & Tucker, J. A. (1996).

(2010). Strigamia maritima (Leach, 1817). In: Barber, A. D. (2017). World database of littoral Myriapoda. Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=105492 on 2017-12-11 It is the most common of the four fully coastal geophilomorph species known in the British Isles. Description In general, Strigamia maritima is the only member of its genus known to occur on the sea shore. The other species of the genus are woodland species. The species are probably concentrated in areas of the shingle bank which are climatically favorable and have a good food supply. They are found only at the top of the shore, around the High-Water Spring drift line on the seaward side of the shingle bank, but this may well be due to the unstable nature of this part of the beach, and the fact that the fauna is usually sparse. The animal is found far lower down on the landward side where it feeds on Sphaeroma and is liable to spasmodic immersion at high spring tides and during bad weather. Immersed animals migrate up the beach suggesting that even the adults are not well adapted to resist fully marine conditions for long. Mature females migrate into moist sandy areas where conditions approximate to terrestrial ones to lay their eggs, and to brood their young which are rapidly desiccated in unsaturated air. The time of egg laying appears to be geared to correspond with the time when spring tides have their smallest amplitude and with the least stormy part of the year. It is far better defined than in terrestrial species. This gearing is reflected in the size of the oocytes in the ovary, which varies only very slightly between different individuals at a given time of the year. Males also migrate up the beach to deposit their spermatophores, and all stages migrate into the top of the shingle bank to moult. Such migrations suggest that the spermatophores, eggs, larval stages and moulting animals are unable to withstand much immersion in sea water. It is possible to separate five post-larval instars in both sexes. The last two being mature as they are in lithobiomorphs. Matures females may be aged by counting the number of whorls of sperm in their seminal receptacles. Since the cast receptacular linings remain intact with their openings facing the receptacular duct, sperm passing up this duct are likely to find their way into the old linings and will therefore become arranged in a number of whorls. The centipede is a nonspecific carnivore that feeds at least from February to November. The main food source is Sphaeroma probably because this crustacean is so abundant. The only likely predators of Strigamia are carabid and staphylinid beetles, and these only take the smaller stadia. Habitat Studies about the habitat of Strigamia were done in different countries. For example: *United Kingdom: at the beach at Cuckmere Haven: The population of Strigamia inhabited a shingle bank on the east side of the mouth of the River Cuckmere which enters the English Channel some two and a half miles east of Seaford, Sussex. Although Strigamia was almost completely absent from the salt marsh proper, a large number of individuals were frequently found at its edge in a narrow belt a few feet wide. The fauna is largely terrestrial in character, the most typical animals being woodlice, ants, and the earwig Porjcub auricularia. L. Strigamia was normally absent from this region. the centipede had deserted this habitat and was not found there in such numbers during the rest of the investigation. The reason for this migration is unknown. * North Europe: The centipedes were recorded at an average density of 4.26±0.96 m -1 with a maximum of 49 m -1. The extremely high densities of Strigamia maritima seen on North European shores, specially in Scotland, are very striking (Figure 1). Strigamia maritima was also recorded from the coasts of Scandinavia, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, Britain, Ireland and northern France. Bergesen et al. (2006) recorded it for the first time for North Norway (under stones in the supralittoral amongst isopods, Porcellio scaber). Whilst Horneland and Meidell (1986) were able to collect “several thousands of specimens” from an island north of Bergen. It is often extremely abundant in favorable situations with large numbers under individual stones, a situation that seems to be paralleled by Geophilus becki according to Habermann (1982). Habitats for S. maritima include shingle, under rocks and stones and in rock crevices. The life history and ecology of this species was studied by Lewis (1961) who related its behavior and its tolerance of seawater at different stages of its life history to it being a mobile species, concentrating in areas that are climatically favorable, have a good food supply and to its breeding season also its ability to migrate up and down beaches. ) Reproduction The anatomy of the male reproductive system was described by Fabre (1855): A pair of fusiform testis open by way of four vasa efferentia, one leaving from each end of each testis; they fuse to form a much-coiled vas deferens, in which the sperm are stored. The vas deferens divides two thirds of the way along its length to pass round the gut, and fuses again before opening ventrally on a sub-terminal penis. Two pairs of tubular accessory glands lie alongside the gut and open posteriorly into the genital atrium. In maturus males there is a gradual buildup of sperm in the vas deferens beginning in August, when small groups of sperm appear at intervals along its length. The sperm are about 2 mm. long and gradually become rolled up in the distal region of the vas deferens, and lower down are coiled on themselves in the manner of a clock spring. By January the vas deferens is much distended with sperm, and remains thus until May when the number of sperm diminishes. By mid-June the vas deferens is again empty. The anatomy of the female reproductive system: S. maritima resembles closely that described for other genera by Fabre (1855) and Schaufler (1889), consisting of an unpaired tubular ovary leading to a short oviduct which divides to pass round the gut, fusing again to open ventrally into the subterminal genital atrium. There is a short pair of accessory glands, and in the prepenultimate pediferous segment there is a pair of spherical receptacula semines the convoluted ducts of which open into the genital atrium along with the accessory glands. After Lewis’s analysis in 1968, about the widths of oocytes in the adolescent female S. maritima, it seems that the matures females are fertilized in May before laying their eggs, but the newly recruited maturus juniors are fertilized soon after the moult that produces them in August. In August, the males contain only small quantities of sperm. This may not mean that the rate of sperm production is low, because the quantity of sperm in the reproductive tract depend on the rate of removal as well as the rate of production. The accumulation of sperm in the vas during the winter may be due to a slowing down or complete cessation of spermatophores production at that time. Lewis suggested that the mature males produce spermatophores both in autumn and in spring. And Palmen & Rantala (1954) showed that female Pachymerium collected in the autumn can raise broods successfully the next spring and concluded that in these cases fertilization occurred before hibernation by indiqueting that in the majority of specimen fertilization seems to occur after hibernation. =Egg and larval stages= The females of S. maritima lay their eggs at the end of May or the beginning of June in small brood cavities hollowed out of the sand in the brooding habitat. The eggs are spherical and measure from 0.9 to 1–25 mm. in diameter. It is, however, easily ruptured. The eggs hatch towards the end of June, and the larval stages closely resemble those described by Verhoeff (1902–25) in MecistocephaZus carniolensis C. L. Koch. Hatching is a very gradual process in Strigamia. the egg shell splits equatorially, and as the embryo, which is bent into a horseshoe shape, gradually elongates and uncurls during development. It pushes the two halves of the shell apart. In S. maritima hatching begins at what Verhoeff terms the last embryonic stage, in which the limbs and mouthparts are represented by simple buds, and the body, covered with cuticle, is inflated anteriorly since it still contains a large quantity of yolk. Eggs which are about to hatch appear pinkish owing to the pinky-violet color of the contained embryos. The pigment occurs in the gut cells of the larvae, the rest of the body being whitish and translucent. The last embryonic stage moults to the “peripatoid” stage in which the trunk is of uniform diameter, and the limbs better developed. In the peripatoid stage, the embryo is immobile, but in the “foetus” stage, it is capable of making writhing movements; it has fully jointed limbs and antennae, and clearly recognizable mouthparts. This stage is dorso-ventrally flattened and averages 7 mm. in length. The first adolescence stage is the last to be brooded by the female and closely resembles the adult in form. =The embryoid phase= The embryoid phase of post-embryonic development of geophilomorph centipedes may represent an extension of embryonic development, possibly in correlation with the evolution of epimorphic development from an anamorphic ancestor, accomplished without completely losing post-embryonic segmentation activity. This continuity in the segmentation process across the embryonic/postembryonic divide may concur to the evolvability of this developmental process. =Postembryonic development= * Embryo: The eggs are spherical, measuring 0.88 to 1.11 mm in diameter. The color is changing from yellow to whitish yellow as the embryo develops. * Embryo to peripatoid As the egg teeth, helped by the increase of yolk in the front part, break the egg-shell the last embryonic stadium appears. This ends up in the peripatoid stadium. At the end of the peripatoid stadium, both the pre- and the metatergites are formed and the embryonic cuticle is only attached at the rear end. * Foetus stadium The body has got its ‘normal’ dorso-ventral flattening. The extremities are segmented and the male gonopods are not developed. The width of the forcipular coxosternite is measured to 0.34 to 0.41 mm. The number of setae is extremely low as compared to the coming stadia. * Adolescens: In this stadium, most characters of the mature animal are apparent, but the numbers of seta, sensory sensilla and coxal glands are increasing through the stadia to follow. It is possible to separate the sexes using a microscope (see male gonopods). Evolving of intentional movement, which eventually leads to the seashore (feeding grounds), is described by Lewis (1961). The major importance is the development of the tracheal system, which also marks the border between foetus and Adolescens 1. It must be the survival factor for animals sporadically submerged in (salt) water, either surviving the submerging or being washed ashore by the same principle. Feeding Other gastropods (Littorina saxatalis) and lumbricid worms were all observed at various times to be fed on by Strigamia maritima. Strigamia maritima attacks small Orchestia (or Drosophila if offered) by tearing the prey to pieces. When attacking larger Orchestia, 1 cm or more in length (which it only did if they were damaged or dying) it made a transverse slit and pushed its head and anterior segments inside and the poison claws were seen to be constantly in motion macerating tissue whilst the centipede was involved in what seemed to be external digestion and suctorial feeding. Group feeding, as observed in this species could be advantageous in dealing with prey that would otherwise be invulnerable to them. Alternatively, small specimens could enter barnacles otherwise inaccessible to larger animals and bring about their opening.  Evolution and development Any individual species of geophilomorph centipede exhibits a much more restricted range of variation in segment number than the range for the group as a whole; just how restricted depends on the species concerned. Some species have a surprisingly large range, for example about 80. Others, in the family Mecistocephalidae, have a range of zero. There is no variation. This family is probably the outgroup to the rest of the Geophilomorpha. Species of Strigamia are intermediate between these two extremes, in that they show a small-to-moderate range of variation. In S. maritima, this range is at least 8 (from 45 to 53). The intraspecific variation has several elements, as described in earlier papers. First, there is sexual dimorphism, with females typically having two segments more than males. Second, there is variation within each sex within a population. Third, there is between-population variation, much of it explicable by a latitudinal cline, in which segment number increases from North to South. The variation cannot be explained by differences in population age structure, because segment number is fixed before hatching. There is no addition of segments during postembryonic growth, despite some assertions to the contrary. So, is the difference caused by genetic or environmental factors? In the naturally occurring variation in the segment number of Strigamia maritima, it is clear that the developmental process, as described above, is being influenced either by genetic or environmental factors, or possibly by both. The difference in segment number distributions between males and females within populations is presumably of genetic origin. But what of the variation within each sex? the importance of genetic and environmental influences on development are now known to be incorrect. early studies have not provided any reliable clues about the causes of the variation in segment number within and between populations in nature. but studies had proved that in Strigamia, the variation is at least partially heritable. But there may yet turn out to be direct environmental effects too like temperature. This environmental factor can have an effect on the number of segments formed during the period of embryogenesis of Strigamia, because the cohorts within the same population that derive from embryonic development in warmer summers have significantly higher segment number distributions than cohorts that develop in cooler summers. Considering in particular the latitudinal cline, this could be a result of selection, with fewer segments being favored in more northern populations, for example because of a slightly but significantly shorter development time (hypothesis, not fact), which might be beneficial in harsher northern climates with shorter summer seasons. On the other hand, if temperature does indeed have a direct effect on segmentation (again, hypothesis rather than fact), then the cline could be caused by this instead. However, if the explanation was solely of this latter kind, i.e. all due to direct environmental effects and no selective component, then it is hard to explain why the observed pattern of between-species variation mirrors its intraspecific equivalent, with more northerly species having fewer segments than their southern counterparts. It is not possible to evolve interspecific differences from non-heritable variation. One compound hypothesis is that speciating peripheral isolates at northern or southern ends of a parent species’ range go through a phase of having a restricted amount of variation in segment number. These may experience canalization of their developmental system so that it is resistant to producing segment numbers outside that range until the newly speciated isolate begins to extend its own range north or south from its starting point, thus again experiencing a wider range of temperatures. Thus, each species would carry a genetic ‘imprint’ of its site of origin. References * Leach, W.E. (1817) The characters of the Genera of the Class Myriapoda, with Descriptions of some Species.

Bauer (born 1957) is Asa Griggs Candler Professor of Psychology at Emory University. She is known for her research in the field of cognitive development, with a specific focus on how children develop their earliest memories and how their memory is influenced by parents, peers, and the environment around them. Her research has explored the phenomenon of childhood amnesia and how social, cognitive, and neural changes relate to the development of autobiographical memory. Bauer was awarded the American Psychological Association Distinguished Scientific Award for an Early Career Contribution to Psychology in the Developmental Area (1993) and the American Psychological Foundation Robert L. Fantz Award (1993). Her book Remembering the Times of Our Lives: Memory in Infancy and Beyond was named Book of the Year (2007) by the Cognitive Development Society. With Simona Ghetti, Bauer edited the volume Origins and Development of Recollection: Perspectives from Psychology and Neuroscience (2012). With Robyn Fivush, she edited The Wiley Handbook on the Development of Children's Memory (2014). Bauer has served as editor of the Journal of Cognition and Development (2005–2009) and the Society for Research in Child Development Monographs (2013–2018).  Biography  Bauer received her Bachelor of Sciences degree in Psychology at Indiana Central University in 1981. She went to graduate school at Miami University where she obtained her M.A. and Ph. D. in Experimental Developmental Psychology. In graduate school, Bauer was mentored by Cecilia Shore, who introduced her to Piaget's genetic epistemology. Cecilia's guidance educated her in applying constructivist theory to a variety of issues regarding language and cognition. Upon graduation, Bauer completed a post-doctoral fellowship at the University of California, San Diego, where she conducted studies of categorization in infants and young children in collaboration with Jean Mandler. Prior to joining the faculty of Emory University in 2007, Bauer held faculty positions at the Institute of Child Development at the University of Minnesota (1989-2005) and at Duke University (2005-2007). While at the University of Minnesota, Bauer was awarded the Horace T. Morse University of Minnesota Alumni Association Award for Outstanding Contributions to Undergraduate Education (2002). Here, she put together a small team of intelligent and ambitious graduate and undergraduate students, motivated to chase further research on the origins of long-term memory and its theoretical shift from infancy to early childhood.  Research  Bauer is widely recognized for her research on the early development of memory, with a specific focus on autobiographical memory of people, objects, and events of personal significance. She utilizes various methods to carry out her research, including eye-tracking and electrophysiological measures. Bauer's work highlights a number of factors that contribute to the formation of memories, including the environment in which an event occurred and its emotional intensity, and the extent to which the information to relates to other pieces of information already stored in memory. In one of her papers co-authored with Mandler, Bauer tested the ability of toddlers to remember events and whether their abilities were comparable to those of preschool-age children as well as adults. This study demonstrated the importance of causal connections and temporal structure in supporting children's earliest event memories. Toddlers, like older children and adults, are more likely to remember a series of events if causal relationships were present that linked the elements in the series. Other notable work on the development of memory is Bauer and colleagues' SRCD monograph on Parameters of Remembering and Forgetting in the Transition from Infancy to Early Childhood.

Pura Dasar Buana is one of the Pura Dang Kahyangan Jagat, a temple which was built to honor a holy teacher of Hindu teaching. Pura Dasar Buana honored Mpu Ghana, a Brahmin who arrived to Bali from Javanese Majapahit to teach Hinduism in the island. History Mpu Dasar Buana temple honored Mpu Wira Ganteng, a Javanese holy teacher or brahmin (known in Bali under the title mpu or rsi) who arrived in Bali in the Saka year 922 (equivalent to the year 1000). Mpu Ghana is one of the Panca Tirtra, five holy teachers of Balinese Hinduism, i.e. Mpu Gnijaya, Mpu Semeru (Mahameru), Mpu Ghana, Mpu Kuturan, and Mpu Bradah (Prada). Mpu Ghana arrived in Bali during the reign of king Udayana Warmadewa (988-1011 AD) and his consort Gunapraya Dharmapatni. Mpu Ghana was a follower of the Ganapatya sect. He strictly followed the Sukkla Brahmacari, where he had to remain celibate for the rest of his life. In the year of 1189 Saka year (1267 AD), Mpu Dwijaksara, another Brahman from the Majapahit Kingdom, built a new pura at the site where Mpu Ghana established his parahyangan (place of meditation or ashram). The pura was built as a form of homage to Mpu Ghana. When Sri Soma Kepakisan, the son of Sri Kresna Kepakisan, was crowned the new king of the Gelgel Kingdom in 1380 AD, he made the pura that was built by Mpu Dwijaksara into a royal pura. The pura was christened Pura Dasar Buana Gelgel. Following the new inauguration of the temple complex, a shrine was constructed to honor the Tri-Residents (Satrya Dalem, Pasek and Pande). In year 1489 AD, Dang Hyang Nirartha came to Bali, and built the Padma Tiga shrine in the inner sanctum of Pura Dasar Buana Gelgel to honor the Brahmins. Temple layout Pura Dasar Buana is located in the village of Gelgel, Klungkung Subdistrict, Klungkung Regency, Bali. The pura is oriented north–south and is divided into three areas: the outer sanctum of the temple (jaba pisan or nistaning mandala), the middle sanctum (jaba tengah or madya mandala), and the inner main sanctum (jero or utamaning mandala). Entrance to the outer sanctum (jaba pisan) is marked with a candi bentar split gate at Jalan Waturenggong. The outer sanctum is a green-grassy courtyard with several large banyan trees growing in the courtyard. A bale gong (pavilion for keeping the gamelan) is located in the outer sanctum, as well as an enclosure where several shrines for local deities are placed. Entrance to the middle sanctum (jaba tengah) is marked with another candi bentar split gate. Several bale pavilions are situated in the middle sanctum, e.g. a bale where cooking of the offering is done, and several others. A bale kulkul, a bale where the slit-drum is kept to announce time for prayer, is situated on the wall boundary between the outer sanctum and the middle sanctum, to the east. The inner sanctum (jero) is the most sacred courtyard of in the temple complex. The inner sanctum of Pura Dasar Buana Gelgel features three multi-tiered meru towers to the left of the paduraksa portal. The tallest of the meru towers is the Meru Tumpang Solas with eleven roof tiers, a shrine dedicated to the descendants of Satrya Dalem. The three- tiered Meru Tumpang Telu shrine is dedicated to Mpu Gnijaya, ancestor of the Pasek. Other three-tiered Meru Tumpang Telu shrine is dedicated to the Pande. The fourth shrine, the Padma Tiga shrine is dedicated to the descendants of the Brahmins. These four shrines is known by the people as the Catur Warga. There are more than 20 shrines and buildings in the inner sanctum. Ritual The piodalan or puja wali festival (pura's anniversary) of Pura Dasar Buana is held twice every year on Monday or soma pon Kuningan. The name of the festival is Pemacekan Agung. Other festivals held in the temple is the annual Padudusan held during the full moon of the fourth month (Balinese purnama kapat) in the Balinese calendar.

Production takes places in Toronto and China. Line the Label claims to have a strong and loyal following from celebrities; those who have reportedly worn the brand include Sarah Jessica Parker, Kate Bosworth, Sandra Bullock, Jennifer Garner, Kate Hudson, and Meghan Markle. History The brand was co-founded by John Muscat and Jennifer Wells in 2000, and acquired by fashion importer PYA a few years later. Originally based in Toronto, the brand expanded to showrooms in Vancouver, Montreal and the US. The clothing is designed for women aged between 25 and 40, and described as \\"for the modern yet urban woman\\". In 2014 the company's knitwear was available in over 600 shops, across boutiques and department stores, and eleven showrooms across four countries. In 2017 Muscat praised outsourcing production to China, stating it can produce quality products and the negative connotations from 20 years ago are no longer relevant. Meghan Markle wore a trench coat designed by the company at the closing of the 2017 Invictus Games. The brand achieved international attention following the 2017 public announcement of her engagement to British Prince Harry, during which she wore a white jacket from the company. Muscat renamed the jacket \\"The Meghan\\" after the actress. The jacket, priced at £450, sold out online immediately; the increased traffic on the website crashed the server. Muscat subsequently released a statement saying it was one of Markle's favourite pieces designed by the company.

Early life and education Kinoshita was born to a wealthy family in 1894. Toward the end of the Taishō period he was admitted to the Nikakai, or Second Section Association, a society of progressive Japanese artists. He associated with artists such as Zentaro Kojima, Katsuzo Satomi, and Yuzo Saeki. During the 1920s he studied in Paris, at the École de Paris. Work Takanori Kinoshita's work is considered to be Yōga, a style of painting produced by Japanese artists using traditional Western techniques and materials. Kinoshita was schooled in Western conventions during his time in Paris though he eschewed the more avant-garde influences of the city in that era, such as Cubism, Surrealism, and Dadaism. He was vocal in his criticism of these movements. In 1923 he collaborated with the Russian artist David Burlick to co-author a book titled What Is Futurism? Answer which critiques Dada. He focused instead on absorbing late Impressionism. The works of Henri Matisse, Édouard Manet, Maurice de Vlaminck and Gustave Courbet were those that most inspired him. After his return to Japan, Kinoshita was included in the Nikakai and Shunyokai exhibitions that promoted work in the European style. In his later development he incorporated elements of Surrealism and those of the Proletarian art movement. Works from the 50s and 60s display an airy realist style and a preference for Western subjects such as still lifes and interior portraits. Through the 1960s and 1970s Kinoshita created a series of nudes. Career By 1930 Kinoshita was well known in Japan. He co-founded the \\"1930 Association\\" along with Hiroshi Maeda, Yuzo Sa, Zentaro Kojima and Shozo Satomi, which sought to propagate the European individualism celebrated by the École de Paris. In 1961 and 1962 a series of Kinoshita's paintings were used as covers for .

Education and early career  Born on 1 February 1969 in Tbilisi, the capital of then-Soviet Georgia, Murjiri was trained as a cellist at the Tbilisi State Conservatoire, which he graduated from in 1991. He received his theological education at the Batumi Theological Seminary in Georgia and further, in Russia, at the Moscow Theological Academy and Saint Tikhon's Orthodox University, from which he received a Doctor of Divinity degree in 2015. Elizbar Mujiri was tonsured a monk under the name of Shio in 1993. He was ordained a deacon in 1995 and a priest of the Georgian Orthodox Church in 1996. He was a father superior at the Kldisubani church of Saint George and then at the Narikala church of Saint Nicholas, both in Tbilisi, between 1997 and 2001 when he was moved to lead St. George parish church in Moscow, serving a local Georgian diaspora community.  Bishop  On 18 August 2003, Shio was appointed to the newly created Georgian Orthodox eparchy of Senaki and Chkhorotsku with a bishops rank. The eparchy was curved out of parts of the Chqondidi and Poti-Senaki bishoprics in the territory of the Samegrelo region. As of 2017, the eparchy operated 39 churches and monasteries. Bishop Shio was additionally placed in charge of the Georgian parishes in Australia and New Zealand on 30 April 2009 and elevated to the rank of a metropolitan on 2 August 2010. He has a seat in the Holy Synod of the Georgian Orthodox Church and is, also, a member of its Canonization Commission. According to the Georgian media outlets, Bishop Shio was a childhood friend of the President of Georgia Giorgi Margvelashvili and the businessman Levan Vasadze. The latter is known for his conservative views and anti-Western rhetoric and has presided, since 2013, over the board of trustees of the government-sponsored Georgian Demographic Revival Fund of which Shio is also a member.  Patriarchal locum tenens  On 23 November 2017, Saint George's Day, the seasoned leader of the Georgian Orthodox Church, Catholicos Patriarch Ilia II announced an appointment of Shio as the patriarchal locum tenens, that is a church official who would act as a temporary head of the Georgian Orthodox Church for 40 days after the incumbent Patriarch died, until the Holy Synod elected a new Patriarch. The decree, drafted by Ilia II with his own hand, came amid the ongoing internal tensions within the church leadership, widely publicized in the aftermath of the \\"cyanide case\\", in which a Georgian Orthodox priest was arrested and ruled guilty on charges of plotting to murder the Patriarch's personal secretary and adviser with cyanide earlier that year. The incumbent patriarch's decision to name his locum in his own lifetime came to many Georgians as a surprise; the Georgian media suggested this might indicate Ilia II's support for Shio's candidacy as a future patriarch.

The building was formerly a professional office, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. History John Divine was born in 1823, and by 1850 had moved to Lexington and married Mary Ann Francis. Soon after, he opened a law office, the first in Sanilac County. Divine served in the state legislature in 1855 and 1856, and in 1859 took on a partner in his law firm, W.S. Mills. Mills left after two years, and Divine soon took another partner, L.L. Wixson. By the mid-1870s, Divine was successful enough to build his own office in Lexington. The building likely housed a store at ground level, with Divine's law offices on the second floor. Divine ran his law practice out of this building until his death in 1892, after which ownership of the building passed to Judge and local resident Watson Beach. In 1902, the building was purchased by Mary, Ella, and Emily Moore, the daughters of Charles H. Moore, who had settled in Lexington in 1854. The women refurbished the building into a public library and meeting hall, naming it after their father. The sisters also gave the library $2500 with which to start an endowment fund, and deeded the library to the village of Lexington in 1904. The building continues to serve as a library. Description The Moore Public Library is a two-story, three-bay brick structure. Although the original structure was likely Italianate in style, the refurbishment by the Moore sisters included the construction of a new facade in a vernacular neoclassical style. This new facade has a rusticated base at the first floor level, and an entry door in the right-hand bay with a brick porch sheltering it. A triple window spans the center and left bay. A wide metal frieze and cornice separates the first and second floors, and wraps around the side of the building. The second floor contains three tall, one- over-one, double hung sash windows. The interior of the building reflects the neoclassical design used to remodel the structure at the turn of the century. The first floor contains a small entry foyer near the front stairway, a large room to the front and a slightly smaller rear room. The walls are finished with tongue-and-groove wainscoting below and plaster on the upper portion. Windows have wood surrounds with molded sides and Classical top-pieces. A stained glass window in the stairwell contains a half-circle top piece and elaborate woodwork surrounds. The second floor contains an open hall flanked by the stairwell, a small room that is now a kitchen, and another small room in the front.

Reception The Absolute Sound review by Greg Cahill said \\"Mount Royal finds the two guitarists exploring atmospheric acoustic tunes, soft-jazzy instrumentals, and the occasional lyrical ballad. There is also a pair of straight-ahead bluegrass instrumentals on which the guitarists weave crosspicked lines to create lacy melodies. “Goldacre” is a better example of how these talented pickers can blend seemingly divergent styles, with Lage adding his moody minor-chord accents to Eldridge’s traditional bluegrass runs. I had hoped for more of that latter approach, in which the duo unites to create a distinctive, blended sound, rather than alternating between their very different styles\\".Cahill, G. The Absolute Sound Review, accessed May 5, 2019 On Jazz Weekly, George W. Harris stated \\"Jazz and bluegrass meet on successful terms ...

He prefers the lower intervals of the chords and Lage, at times, likes the higher ones, and they both like a measure of scruffy dissonance. Eldridge has always been an adventurous player, and Lage is unrestrained ... I like everything on the record, but Eldridge’s piercing singing is best, I think, on “Things in Life” and “Sleeping By Myself.” Everything else is simply two acoustic guitars, and, even in our present moment of great richness in music of all kinds, it has the virtue of sounding like nothing else.\\".Wilkinson, A.

The series, adapted from the 1978 novel of the same name by author Reginald Hill, was the first Dalziel and Pascoe adaptation for TV, arriving two years before the more widely known and acclaimed BBC adaptation that followed in 1996. In this miniseries, the characters of Dalziel and Pascoe were played by comedians Gareth Hale and Norman Pace, with Christopher Fairbank as loyal sidekick Edgar Wield, and Malcolm Storry as Insp. Ray Crabtree. Reception The series broadcast over three consecutive Saturday nights, from 9 April 1994. Reginald Hill was said to have been unhappy with the series; and as such prevented ITV from creating any further adaptations for television. The Independent went on to describe the \\"critical contempt heaped on the first television version\\" of the legendary characters. It described how \\"a complex story of pornography and murder was turned into a vehicle for the dramatic talents of Hale and Pace, by common consent breathtakingly miscast as the chalk-and-cheese Yorkshire coppers. While either of them might conceivably have scraped by as the blunt, earthy Dalziel, it's hard to see how anybody could have imagined one of them playing the sensitive, intellectual Pascoe\\". BBC Worldwide subsequently approached Hill with a view to creating a new TV adaptation, to which Hill agreed. Actors Warren Clarke and Colin Buchanan were subsequently cast in the roles of Dalziel and Pascoe, and between 16 March 1996 and 22 June 2007, eleven series consisting of both novel adaptations and original stories were produced.

Early life She was born Margery Berney on 23 May 1913, probably in Portsmouth, the second of four daughters of Samuel Berney, a cinema owner and builder, of Portsmouth, and his wife Deborah Berney, née Rose. Her grandparents on both sides of the family were Russian Jewish immigrants. She was educated at Brondesbury and Kilburn High School, London, followed by the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). Career She started acting while still a RADA student, two nights a week with the repertory company at Collins's Music Hall, which her father had just bought. In 1946, she founded Brook Street Bureau and was its managing director. In a 1965 report in Time magazine, shortly before the company went public in an initial public offering (IPO) on the London Stock Exchange, Hurst was described as one of Britain's richest women, and the head of the UK's largest secretarial employment agency, and was quoted as saying, \\"I never thought for a moment that I could fail\\". In 1965, Brook Street Bureau was actually the world's largest office employment agency. For the flotation, she was persuaded that it would not be possible to have a woman as chairman of a public company, so she reluctantly agreed to stay on as managing director, with her husband as chairman.

Gries is noted to have made some influential progress for women in this field. In 2017, Gries published the book titled Anomalies—Pioneering Women in Petroleum Geology: 1917-2017. Gries is recognized as an unconventional thinker when approaching geological concepts and applications.  Early life  Gries was born in San Antonio, Texas in 1943 and her full birth name is Ruth Roberta Rice. She has used her nickname, Robbie, most of her life. Her father was a gulf shrimper and Robbie was delighted to collect marine fauna for her zoology classes from her father's boat. Gries, on vacations away from the Gulf Coast was fascinated with rocks and collected them on journeys, but never heard the word \\"geology\\" until she was a sophomore in college. Gries graduated from Del Mar College, where she had her first geology courses and developed a passion for the science. She envisioned her next steps to be at the University of Texas but her junior credits would not transfer so she moved out of state to study at the Colorado State University where she was the first woman to graduate with a degree of geology. Gries then moved to The University of Texas where she completed her master's degree. During graduate school, Robbie Rice married John Charles Gries and had her first and only child (Lynn Margaret). After graduate school The Grieses moved to Wichita, Kansas where he joined the geology faculty at Wichita State University.  Career  Eventually divorcing, in 1973 Robbie Gries moved back to Colorado, and gained employment with Texaco, Inc.. She was hired during the Affirmative Action push for oil companies to fulfill diversity employment plans and was nicknamed \\"token\\" in her office. Her areas of exploration included New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming. In 1977 she accepted a job with Reserve Oil and Gas in Denver. At that time she and the female geophysicist at Reserve became the first female members of the Denver Petroleum Club, breaking another barrier for women. The Denver Petroleum Club was the first such establishment in the US to accept female members. Gries, in 1980 became a consultant and was retained by Mabee Petroleum (Tulsa, Oklahoma), Amarex Petroleum (Oklahoma City), and Burnett Oil and Gas (Fort Worth) over the next ten years. In 1993 she facilitated a merger between Skaer Petroleum and Pease Oil and Gas and became an officer in the consolidated company. In 1994 she resigned and crafted her own startup; Priority Oil & Gas, LLC. Priority began buying oil and gas properties and new leases and was dedicated to exploring, operating and drilling, primarily in Kansas, Colorado, and Wyoming. In 2001, Gries was elected president of AAPG. In this time, she visited 44 countries and led the development of international oil research. Currently, Gries remains the president of her company.  Awards and recognition  Gries has been an officer and committee chair for the Rocky Mountain Association of Geologists (RMAG). She received their Distinguished Service Award (1987), Honorary Membership (1989), and Special Humanitarian Award (2006). Gries was a Director for the Colorado Oil and Gas Association, Denver, CO, from 1993 to 2009. She was also a member of the Colorado and International Women's Forum from 1985 to 2009 and was President of the Colorado Forum in 1997. She received the Woman Leader of Excellence Award in 1997 from the Colorado Women's Leadership Coalition. In 2018 she selected as one of the Top Women in Energy by the Denver Business Journal. The American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) has awarded her for Distinguished Service (1991), Honorary Membership (1998), the Leverson Award for best technical paper in the Rocky Mountain Section (1985). Prior to becoming the President of AAPG she Chaired the Distinguished Lecture Committee and expanded it globally; Chaired the Ethics Committee, created the Diversity Committee (now PROWESS), Chaired the Advisory Committee, and was General Chairman for the Annual meeting in 1994 in Denver, Co. She is a Trustee Associate and a member of the Corporate Board for the AAPG Foundation. In 2012, Gries was awarded the Michel Halbouty Award for Outstanding Leadership. The award recognizes petroleum geologists who have displayed exceptional leadership and remarkable service in a corporation, research facility or academic institution. Gries is the first woman in history to have received the award. Gries was one of the founders (2001) and officers of GeoScience World, McLean, Virginia, an internet resource for the geosciences, an electronic aggregate of geoscience journal publications and books made available globally to universities, corporations and individuals. In 1997, the Colorado Women's Leadership Coalition awarded Gries with the Woman Leader of Excellence Award. This prestigious achievement signifies the impact she has made for women in her field. RMAG awarded her for technical papers or presentations in 1980, 1982, and 1986. She is a Fellow, past treasurer and President-elect (2018–19) of the Geological Society of America.

Weeksite is named after her. She identified uranophane in 1953 along with Mary E. Thompson. Weeks was the first to propose the concept of oxidation of ore deposits that contain uranium, vanadium, and other accessory metals. She founded the Geology Department at Temple University in Philadelphia, and was a strong proponent of women in geology.  Early life and family  Alice Mary Dowse Weeks and her twin sister Eunice were born August 26, 1909 in Sherborn Massachusetts. Alice's mother Jessie Parker Dowse was raised in Uxbridge, Massachusetts and attended Tufts University. Jessie worked as a teacher until marrying Arthur Dowse, who worked as a banker among other occupations. Alice's mother was an advocate for her children's education as well as women's rights and encouraged them to learn at a young age. Alice married Dr. Albert Weeks, a long-term friend and companion, in May 1950. Albert, a petroleum geologist, encouraged Alice in her career and helped to motivate her to complete her dissertation.  Education  Alice who was homeschooled in her early years, attended and graduated from Sawin Academy and Dowse High School in 1926. She then attended Tufts University, receiving a degree in science and mathematics and graduating cum laude in 1930. After teaching at the Lancaster school for girls for roughly two and a half years, she returned to Tufts to take several geology courses. Following the end of her time at Tufts, she attended Harvard University in Massachusetts for graduate school, where she received her master’s of science degree in 1934. Due to financial instability, and the additional pressures of being a woman in science at Harvard, Weeks was unable to continue working towards her doctorate. Allegedly, she had to sit outside of classrooms for certain lectures that did not permit women to attend. She accepted a Research Fellowship at Bryn Mawr College, Pennsylvania, and after a year began working there as a laboratory instructor. After another year working at Bryn Mawr, Weeks returned to Harvard to continue to work towards her doctorate in 1936. During this time, Weeks also began working as a professor at Wellesley College, Massachusetts, as a laboratory instructor of historical and physical geology, geomorphology, cartography, and much more. She later became a member of the faculty as an assistant professor. Her knowledge and skill in cartography, as well as being ambidextrous, led to her teaching map-making to Navy Officers during WWII. Due to the constraints and rationing that came with the War, it wasn’t until 1949 when Weeks was awarded her Doctorate.  Career and legacy  Uranium silicate mineral, Weeksite Weeks' work focused on radioactive deposits, and from 1949–1961 she worked for the USGS Uranium Exploration. Weeks was a charter member of the Women Geoscientists Committee of the American Geological Institute, and earned fellowships at the Geological Society of America, the Mineralogical Society of America, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Weeks later went on to become a professor of mineralogy at Temple University in Philadelphia, where she founded their Geology Department. Weeksite, a uranium silicate mineral, is named after her. Weeks is also recognized for identifying uranophane in 1953 along with Mary E. Thompson of the U.S. Geological Survey, and was the first to propose the concept of oxidation of ore deposits that contain uranium, vanadium, and other accessory metals. In 1994 the estate of Albert and Alice Weeks established a special endowment at the University of Wisconsin-Madison which supports a Distinguished Professorship and other programs.  Role of women in science  During Weeks' time, women were not widely accepted in the world of geology, and she occasionally was not permitted to attend specific classes, having to sit outside. In order to collect samples from uranium mines, Weeks was forced to dress up as a man to evade the superstition against allowing women to enter mines. As one of the first woman geologists, she was listed in the \\"American Men of Science\\" well before it was changed to \\"American Men and Women of Science\\".  Later life and death  In 1976, Weeks retired from Temple University, and in 1980 the Northeastern Section of the Geological Society of America held a symposium on uranium in her honor. Suffering from Alzheimer's disease, Weeks died on August 27, 1988; her sister Eunice also had Alzheimer's.

Introductory diving is an opportunity for interested people to find out by practical experience at a relatively low cost if they would be interested in greater involvement in scuba diving. For scuba instructors and diving schools is it an opportunity to acquire new customers. An introductory diving experience is much less time-consuming and costly than the completion of autonomous diver training, but has little lasting value, as it is an experience program only, for which no certification is issued. Introductory scuba diving experiences are intended to introduce people to recreational diving, and increase the potential client base of dive shops to include people who do not have the time or inclination to complete an entry level certification program.  Procedure  PADI education system Participants are usually required to read and sign waivers to minimise liability of the program provider, and to provide a declaration that they do not suffer from any medical condition listed that would be an unacceptable risk for diving. Prior to the dive itself, an instructor teaches essential theoretical knowledge, so that the participants can dive with a low level of risk, and with informed consent. After putting on the necessary diving equipment, the participant enters the water under close supervision of the instructor. First of all, breathing from the scuba regulator is practiced at the water surface. At shallow water depth, some scuba skills are learned: Clearing the diving mask, removing the regulator from the mouth and replacing and clearing it of water. These two skills are essential for the safety of the participants. Afterwards, there may be an opportunity to either play underwater games or explore the surroundings in shallow water. Trial diving usually takes about two to four hours. The participant learns the basic minimum safety guidelines and skills needed to dive under the direct supervision of a diving professional. If an open water dive is included, a few more basic skills will be practiced in confined water. The course includes: *Introduction to the scuba equipment used to dive and how to move around underwater using the equipment. *Breathing underwater on open circuit scuba and how to avoid barotrauma. *Learning some of the key skills that are used during every scuba dive. *Swimming around and exploring within the limits of the program and the local environment. *Information on how to enroll in a training course to become a certified entry-level recreational scuba diver through the providing agency. = Venue = Usually the introductory diving first takes place in confined water, which usually means a swimming pool or a very shallow and safe place in a lake or the sea. Depending on the offer, after the first dive in confined water, a second or further shallow dives may be done in suitable confined or open water. =Altitude and flying after diving= People can go directly from high altitude to scuba diving, but should not scuba dive then go up in altitude without allowing an interval, depending on the time and depth of the dive, to reduce risk of decompression sickness. The Divers Alert Network (DAN) Flying after Diving workshop of 2002 recommended a 12-hour surface interval for uncertified individuals who took part in an introductory scuba experience before flying or ascending to an altitude greater than, or cabin pressure less than, an altitude equivalent of .  Prerequisites  CMAS education system The diving school may ask that the participants of the trial dive prove their medical fitness to dive with a medical certificate, but more commonly they will use a standardized form for the participant to declare their self assessment of fitness to dive. From the age of 8 years it is possible to take part in an introductory dive, but some providers require a greater age. The participant should be able to swim at least without any buoyancy aid.  Introductory diving programs The international standard ISO 11121 standardizes the minimum requirements for an \\"Introductory Training Program\\". Despite the standardization, the title and contents of the program vary depending on the provider and their membership of a diver certification agency. The following programs are based on ISO 11121. = CMAS = The CMAS Introductory Scuba Experience participants should be at least 14 years of age and able to swim. The \\"Introductory Scuba Experience\\" includes a theory lesson, a confined water dive where several diving skills are practiced and an open water dive to a maximum depth of . = NAUI = Participants in a NAUI Try scuba / Passport Diver program must be at least 10 years old. However, it is possible to take part in a confined water dive from the age of 8 years. The \\"Try scuba\\" program includes a theory lesson and a confined water dive where participants practice several dive skills and one or more open water dives. The first open water dive has recommended depth limit of . For further dives there is a limit of . Participants who have completed two open water dives will receive an \\"NAUI Passport Diver\\" confirmation. It enables them to participate in further open water introductory dives later on, guided by a NAUI instructors, without repeating the confined water dive. = NAUI Tandem Diver = The \\"Tandem Diver\\" program is an alternative to the \\"NAUI Try scuba\\" and differs mainly by the individual supervision of the participant and lack of the opportunities offered by the \\"NAUI Passport Diver\\". = PADI = SSI education system Participants in a PADI Discover Scuba Diving program should be at least 10 years old and should be able to swim. The \\"Discover Scuba Diving\\" program includes a theory lesson and a confined water dive where basic diving skills are practiced. Afterwards, one or more directly supervised open water dives can be done to a maximum depth of . Discover Scuba Diving includes the theoretical content and skills of the first lesson of the PADI Open Water Diver course, and this experience may be credited as the first confined water dive of a PADI Open Water Diver course if done within for one year, The PADI Discover Scuba Diving course allows for repetitive diving experiences within a time limit at the discretion of the dive instructor and dive shop. This is a common request for people who try diving, then want to repeat the activity (often at a different location). = PADI Bubblemaker = The \\"Bubblemaker\\" program is a trial dive in the swimming pool for children from 8 years of age. The participants are introduced to scuba diving in a playful way by a scuba instructor. The maximum allowed diving depth is . = SSI Try scuba = Participants must be at least 8 years old. The \\"Try scuba\\" course takes place in confined water and includes a theory session. The participant may be submerged to a maximum depth of . = SSI Try Scuba Diving = Participants must be at least 10 years old. SSI \\"Try Scuba Diving\\" is similar to the Try Scuba (Pool) program. The main difference is that it includes an open water dive and can be credited towards an SSI Open Water Diver course later. For open water dives there is a depth limit of .  Other types of introductory diving  There are programs for advanced divers that are also called introductory diving. These include programs that allow an experienced diver to try out technical diving, rebreather, or cave diving.

It rises in glacial till near Chardon, Ohio, and cuts through the Defiance Moraine on its way north and exposes rock formations from the Paleozoic Era, including the fossiliferous Chagrin Shale. It joins the Grand River in Painesville Township in Helen Hazen Wyman Park. With a watershed of its tributaries include Cutts, Jenks, Aylworth, East, Gordon and Kellogg Creeks. It has previously been known as Bigg Creek, and West Creek. Big Creek flows through a number of parks, and is known for its fishing of smallmouth bass, and steelhead trout that spawn in the creek. History Although now an area for recreation including hiking, fishing and camping the Big Creek valley was once a place of industrial activity with saw mills, iron furnaces and a leather tannery. One of the mills was owned by Eber Howe a local newspaper editor and abolitionist, who used the mill as a \\"station\\" on the Underground railroad for slaves who were escaping to Canada by crossing Lake Erie at Painesville. As the route allowed the slaves to reach liberty, the mill became known as Liberty Hollow. Pease Hollow (now at the corner of Cascade Road and Girdled Road) was the site of a mill that was built by David Pease and used to power lathes and tools for turning wood to make furniture & small wares. Griswold Hollow (now Clark Road from Robinson Road to the Concord Township Line) was the site of a small sandstone quarry (along Jenks Creek) that was noted in a Geological Survey of the area in 1912. Flora and Fauna left Big Creek traverses three nearly contiguous forested parks. The terrain is undulating and dissected by many small tributary streams with steep banks. In some places, the creek cuts through 40 to 50 feet of till and provides scenic overlooks. The wetter lowland areas near the creek are home to sycamore and cottonwood trees while the better drained hilltops are generally home to a Beech-Maple forest interspersed with patches of predominantly red oak, hemlock, and hickory trees. Wildflowers including trilliums and bluebells are abundant in the spring. The forests are home to abundant white tailed deer and turkeys. Red, gray, black, flying, and fox squirrels, racoons, possum, foxes and coyotes are also frequently seen. Black bears have been reported in nearby areas. Kingfishers and wood ducks can be spotted along the creek, and swallows make nests in the banks that overlook open areas. Numerous types of woodpeckers can be spotted or heard in the forest, including pileated, red bellied, hairy, and downy.

It is the oldest continuously operating faith-based news journal in Ghana, and one of the oldest newspapers in the country. It was set up on the Gold Coast in 1883 by the Basel Evangelical Missionary Society. The first issue was published in Basel on 1 March 1883 under the editorship of the German missionary and philologist, Johann Gottlieb Christaller who had then retired from the mission.  History  Christaller noted that many German Basel missionaries were not proficient in the English language and urged prospective writers to make use of English scholars for further review and proofreading before final submission to him, the editor, as he was not a native English speaker. A few months before, in a letter to the editor from Christiansborg dated 13 October 1882, the first Basel missionary-trader Hermann Ludwig Rottman inferred that \\"the primary aim of the journal was to encourage people who were not proficient in English to write in Twi or Ga\\" A similar news publication, the Christian Messenger and Examiner had earlier been founded in 1859 by Wesleyan missionaries, Thomas Birch Freeman and Henry Wharton as a medium to translate foreign literature and classical works into native African languages. Originally, the medium of publication was English, Ga and Twi. The newspaper temporarily changed its name to the \\"Christian Reporter\\" and published solely in Twi while the \\"Christian Messenger\\" was printed in Ga. Subscription climbed to a readership of 600 but sharply decreased over time. After Christaller's death in 1895, the printing of the newspaper ceased. Production started again in 1905 at then newly established Basel Mission Printing Office in Akropong. The newspaper has opinion pieces, news bulletins, advertisements, banns of marriage and obituaries and funeral announcements of notable individuals associated with the Presbyterian Church of Ghana. The newspaper also publishes feature articles on topical issues like Fruit of the Spirit, etc. and publishes authoritative information on the various groups in the Church such as the Women's Fellowship, the Young People's Guild (YPG) and the Young Adult Fellowship (YAF). The administration of the church appoints an editor-in-chief for a tenure of about four years. General oversight and management of the newspaper is carried out by an Editorial Board. The Basel Missionaries originally established the newspaper as a way “to inform, educate, evangelize and entertain its readers... to the north, east, west and south” corners of the Church. The Basel Mission under the United Trading Company (UTC) aimed to win over converts to Christianity through its readership, in addition to provision of Christian activities, general news, entertainment, travel journals as well as relevant political events and on the Gold Coast. This was in line with the original aim of the newspaper which was \\"to encourage African scholars to write in Twi and Ga.\\" The newspaper also informs readers about the developments within the church, its structure and hierarchy, Presbyterian terminologies as well as the work of the Presbyteries, Districts, Congregations. Today, the newspaper also covers socioeconomic, political trends, military history and contemporary changes in global society.

A field visit in 2012 shows the Heart as being made up of a heart-shape of 25 visible quartz pebbles, with a 26th pebble in the centre, and measuring by . Research done by Historic Scotland in 2015 concluded that from the evidence available, it was the only example in Scotland of a permanent physical Scottish Travellers' memorial.  Origins  The Scottish travelling community maintain that the Heart was established as a monument to local tinkers who joined the Jacobite Rising of 1745, and weddings have been celebrated at the site since the mid-1800s. The Heart was removed during roadworks in 1928, but local protests forced its reinstatement. The monument's location was originally at the junction of the Strachar Road and the Hell's Glen, but this junction was bypassed by new road building in the 1970s, thus placing the monument in a field.  Campaign for scheduled monument status  In 2008, Argyll and Bute council proposed a programme of restoration work for the Heart, however local citizens objected to the cost (£34,500) and undertook to care for the site themselves. Scheduled monument status had been investigated in 2012 but refused on the basis that the site did not meet the necessary criteria. In May 2014, author Jess Smith lodged a petition with the Scottish Parliament, asking the Scottish Government to require Historic Scotland ‘to investigate what action can be taken to ensure the restoration and preservation of the Heart’. In February 2015 Historic Scotland announced that they would reconsider the application, this time taking equalities issues into consideration. Historic Scotland launched a programme of research including a public consultation in March 2015, aimed initially at the travelling community, and local area residents. The consultation differed from those usually undertaken in similar situations, in that it took account of the significance of the oral tradition to the community to which the monument was of importance. The research concluded in May 2015, and the site was added to the Schedule of Monuments in June 2015. The campaign was supported by the MSP for Argyll and Bute Michael Russell. Of the new methodology used in the consultation, Historic Scotland Director of Heritage Management Barbara Cummins said she hoped it would \\"pave the way for how we undertake our work in future.”  References  External links * Scheduled Ancient Monuments in Argyll and Bute ","title":"The Tinkers' Heart"},{"id":"55913802","text":"Ghaya Oliveira is a Tunisian-born chef who works as the New York City-based restaurant Daniel as pastry chef.

According to these claims, the then Marxist government of Afghanistan's soldiers and policemen drove to a village called Kerala in Kunar Province, eastern Afghanistan, shooting at over one thousand unarmed civilians. Associated Press had reports of 640 males allegedly put to death in April 1979.  Background  Kerala was a farming community of 5,000, around 12 miles from the Pakistan border. Much of Kunar Province had seen fighting between the Communist Democratic Republic of Afghanistan Army personnel and rebels hiding near the mountains since the Saur Revolution in 1978. On April 19, the day before the incident, local rebels attacked an army garrison in the nearby town of Chaga Serai.Afghanistan: The Soviet War by Edward Girardet, 1985.

At around the same time, there was the Herat mutiny in March 1979 and the declaration of \\"holy war\\" by rebel leaders based in Pakistan About 200 armed government troops and police, arrived in tanks in the village on Friday, April 20. It was alleged that the officers aimed their Kalashnikovs at the men and told them to shout pro-communist slogans. Instead, the men shouted Allahu akbar.Afghanistan: The Soviet War by Edward Girardet, 1985. Page 109 The officers then allegedly ordered them to crouch down facing the tanks, and soon after started shooting at them. There were claims that having killed the victims, bulldozers arrived thereafter and buried the bodies in a mass grave. It has been suggested that this was a local initiative taken by government forces based in Kunar. According to one witness, \\"There was a rumor that Russians were coming to take the women away in buses...But there were no Russians.\\" Among the dead in the fighting were Wazir Mohammad, a local Communist official who was the principal of the girls' school at nearby Chigha Sarai, and Mohammad Yashteen, also a staunch communist party member, who taught at the local primary school. The allegations were refuted by Russian media. In particular, the Russian press agency Tass denounced reports published by a number of American publications about the allegations, particularly Newsweek and Christian Science Monitor. Nikolai Repin, a Tass commentator, charged that the western news media had shattered all records in anti-Soviet propaganda in spreading what he called \\"the monstrous misinformation\\" about a massacre.

A free woman of color, she married Julien Fédon, a French Catholic, like herself of mixed ancestry. Together, she and her husband bought a plantation and engaged as planters and slave owners in the colonial period. Grenada changed hands between the French and British several times during the couple's life, causing persecution for the couple when the British were in authority. Cavelan was arrested in 1787 and forced to provide evidence of her free status, though she was well known to the British, having conducted numerous business transactions with British business men. Though large landowners, Cavelan and her husband were increasingly denied the right to engage in public affairs. In the 1790s they began manumitting their slaves and in 1795 staged a revolt against British rule. Branded traitors, they led a revolt which lasted nearly two years, but were never captured by the British. Cavelan's whereabouts after the rebellion ended are unknown. Early life Marie Rose Cavelan was born around 1752 in the French colony, Le Grenade to Marianne Lemico and Michel Cavelan. Her father had immigrated from Martinique and moved to Le Grenade around 1750. Her mother was originally from the Sainte Rose Parish of Le Grenade. Documents of her heritage are conflicting, as some refer to her as a mulatresse libre, free mulatto woman and others show her to be femme mestive, a woman of mixed Amerindian and mulatta descent. At the end of the Seven Years' War in 1763, the French ceded La Grenade to the British. The British regime allowed free persons of colour to own land and weapons, marry, and exercise free movement, all of which had been restricted under the French governors. During this volatile time, three of the Cavelan sisters, Elizabeth, Marguerite and Marie Rose, would marry brothers of the Fédon family. In 1774, Cavelan married Julien Fédon in an English ceremony, as the British forbade them a Catholic ceremony. In 1779, the French recaptured Grenada, and the following year, the couple remarried under French authorities on 31 January 1780 in a Catholic ceremony. Later, they had a daughter born in December of that year. Lead up to revolt In 1784, the British retook the island and an exodus of French planters to Trinidad ensued. Repressive laws passed by the British towards French Catholics, between 1784 and 1795, increasingly closed free blacks from participating in the public affairs of the colony. Originally, the laws were aimed at curtailing French Catholic autonomy, but as the place the French planters had occupied was taken over by free people of colour, the laws began being applied to them as well. Cavelan and Fédon initially lived in Grand Pauvre (now Saint Mark Parish), where they ran a small plantation, known as Lancer. In February 1787, Cavelan was arrested under a law passed the previous year, which required her to show evidence of her status as a \\"free coloured\\" to the authorities in the capital, St. George's. She was well known to the authorities, as the owner of the plantation, Lancer, who had transacted business in her own name, and as the wife of Fédon. When the law was passed, she saw no reason to travel the fourteen miles from her home to the capital to register her free status, as the legal intent was ostensibly to curtail vagabonds. The law supposedly applied to all free coloureds but was typically enforced only upon women, as a means of discouraging miscegenation and reinforcing white superiority. If Cavelon was unable to prove her free status within six weeks, the authorities were empowered to sell her into slavery. Fédon used his network, contacting Joseph Verdet, who had served as best man at their wedding and François Philip, who was a wealthy white planter, to vouch for her status. John Hay, the acting justice of the peace, accepted their oaths and released Cavelan after several weeks of incarceration, issuing her a certificate of freedom. The French Revolution broke out in 1789, spawning revolts across the wider French Caribbean. In 1790, Fédon, along with thirty-five other Frenchmen, predominantly free coloured, signed a \\"Public Declaration of Loyalty\\", which professed that though French, their loyalty lay with Britain. That same year, Cavelan and Fédon relocated to Saint John Parish. Selling Lancer, which contained 38.5 acres of land and ten slaves for three thousand one hundred and fifty pounds (£3,150). They simultaneously bought the Belvidere Estate, a cacao and coffee plantation from James Campbell, \\"a Senior Member of the Council and former Acting Governor\\" of the colony. For the price of fifteen thousand pounds (£15,000), the purchase included 450 acres of land and the buildings, 16 cows, 5 horses, and 80 slaves. Beginning in 1790, the couple began to manumit the slaves that they owned, releasing Guillaume La Grange; Louis; and Mary Jeanne from Cabresse Island along with her children, Francois Louis, Edward and Rose in 1791. The acquisition of such a large estate, evidences that the couple had moved from nominally successful to part of the emerging free coloured elite. The appointment of the ultra-Protestant planter, Ninian Home, as Lieutenant Governor in 1793, ensured that none of the colonists of French descent would be allowed to participate in the Legislative Assembly. The following year, the French National Convention abolished slavery and extended citizenship to all former slaves in all of the French colonies. The Convention sent out emissaries to make contact with those colonies, which had long-standing ties to France, to regain loyalties in the eastern Caribbean. By the time the agents reached Grenada, a revolt was already well-organized, with Fédon as the leader of the insurgents, which included free coloureds, slaves and maroons. The French agents offered to provide military assistance and guidance, which included the use of Jacobin terror tactics. Rebellion Fédon's rebellion started at the beginning of March 1795. Taking the British by surprise, the rebels quickly captured Governor Home on 2 March and within two days had forty-three prisoners secured at Belvidere. Cavelan was as deeply invested as her husband in the revolt, as attested by eyewitness testimonies, which place both she and her daughters at the Battle of Mt. Qua-Qua. Fédon sent a demand for surrender to the British, who rejected the demands, instead promising amnesty to those who gave up the fight. Fédon was named in the September Act of Attainder which declared the insurgents traitors. The British officially extinguished the revolution on 19 June 1796 and thereafter the Fédon estates were confiscated. Rumors surfaced that Fédon had escaped to Cuba, but record of Cavelan after 8 April 1795 has not been found.

Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee attempted to block her nomination because she declined to fully commit to requiring corporations to publicly disclose political donations. Peirce was eventually approved by the Senate Banking Committee, but the full Senate never voted on her nomination. On July 18, 2017, the White House announced that President Donald Trump would nominate Peirce as a Commissioner of the SEC for the remainder of a five-year term expiring on June 5, 2020.

Views Peirce regularly contributed through books, articles, comments and statements to the debate about banking regulation. She has been critical of the regulatory expansion enacted in response to the 2008 financial crisis. In her 2012 book Dodd-Frank, What It Does and Why It's Flawed, she argues for economic freedom and against the idea that markets could be improved through regulatory micromanagement. In fact, she argues, the more important regulation becomes, the less are banks oriented towards their actual duty, which is to service customers with financial opportunities. In 2016, a book she co-edited entitled Reframing Financial Regulation: Enhancing Stability and Protecting Consumers was published by the Mercatus Center. Peirce had opinion editorials published in The New York Times in 2012 and in 2013, wherein she argued that it would be more sensible to let the market pare the big banks down to size rather than nationalizing them. Peirce has also authored articles in American Banker, The Hill and FinRegRag. In January 2017, she spoke at the American Economic Association in Chicago, where she discussed reforms of the role of financial regulators a topic she had previously raised in a video by the Mercatus Center in 2015. In 2018, Peirce argued that lawyers who work for large corporations practice a form of public interest law.

This radar approach facility is operated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The primary responsibility of Cape Approach is the safe, orderly, and expeditious flow of arrival, departure, and inter-island traffic in and around the Cape and Islands area of Massachusetts, at and below 10,000 feet MSL. K90 is responsible for providing arrival and departure, and radar services the following airports: * Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod (KFMH) - Formally Otis ANGB. * Nantucket Memorial Airport (KACK) * Martha's Vineyard Airport (KMVY) * Hyannis Municipal Airport (KHYA) * Plymouth Municipal Airport (KPYM) * Chatham Municipal Airport (KCQX) * Provincetown Municipal Airport (KPVC) * Falmouth Airpark (5B6) * Katama Airpark (1B2) * Cape Cod Airport (2B1) * Several other small airfields scattered across the area. Cape TRACON is open daily from 6:00 am (local) until 10:00 pm local. During the summer months the facility is open until 11:00 pm (local). When the facility is not open, air traffic control services are provided by Boston ARTCC, Area D.  Airspace  Cape TRACON is responsible for the airspace approximately 30-40 nautical miles from Hyannis airport at and below 10,000 feet. In the vicinity of the Plymouth Airport, K90 is responsible for the airspace at and below 7,000 feet. Boston ARTCC is responsible for the airspace above the TRACON's. K90 is bordered to the west by Providence Approach, to the north by Boston TRACON, and the rest by Boston ARTCC, Area D. Cape Approach operates two radar and ARTS systems. Their ASR-8 system is located at the facility and the ASR-9 system is located on the field at Nantucket Airport. The ASR-9 system was added to improve the radar coverage of the Nantucket airspace. These two systems work independently of each other but sit side-by-side in the control room. When one system is out of service (for scheduled and non-scheduled maintenance), the other system can be used as a back up (with some limitations). NOTE: In preparation for Cape TRACON's consolidation into Boston TRACON (scheduled cut-over date February 2018) currently only the ASR-8 system is being used to allow for single scope operation. This is allowing controllers to transfer to Boston TRACON early to start the training process early. = North Side Radar System = The ASR-8 Radar and ARTS systems have 4 sectors of airspace: These sectors are combined and de-combined as traffic and staffing permit. * OTIS ARRIVAL (O scope): This sector is responsible for traffic over the Cape Cod peninsula and Plymouth areas at and below 3,000 feet. Arrivals and departures from FMH, HYA, PYM, CQX, PVC, 5B6, and 1B2 airports. * CAPE NORTH ARRIVAL (N scope): This sector is responsible for traffic over the Cape Cod peninsula and Plymouth areas at above 4,000 feet. It has sequence setting authority for ACK arrivals via the Marconi VOR (LFV). * CAPE SOUTH ARRIVAL (S scope): Responsible for the separation of traffic in the vicinity of Martha's Vineyard island 050-100. This sector sequences IFR traffic into Nantucket Airport from the west and has sequence setting authority for Cape and Island departures westbound via Providence VOR. * MARTHA'S VINEYARD ARRIVAL (Y scope): Responsible for Martha's Vineyard Airport arrivals and departures. This controller sequences and vectors IFR arrivals to the active runway and will radar identify, climb, and turn on course IFR departures from MVY. This sector also handles any IFR traffic into or out of the Katama Airpark. = South Side Radar System = The ASR-9 Radar and ARTS systems have 2 sectors of airspace: These sectors are combined and de-combined as traffic and staffing permit. * NANTUCKET ARRIVAL (D scope): Just as the name suggests, this sector sequences arriving IFR aircraft to the active runway at Nantucket Airport (ACK). * NANTUCKET DEPARTURE (K scope): This sector is responsible for separating departing IFR traffic from ACK. This sector will also sequence IFR arrivals coming in from the opposite side of the airport from the final approach in use (example: traffic from the west when runway 24 in use) and hand them off to the Nantucket Arrival controller. = Other Operational Positions = Cape TRACON also operates 2 Flight Data positions: * Flight Data 1 (FD1): Duties include reading IFR clearances to pilots on the ground at K90's satellite airports, obtaining release times for airport under Traffic Management Initiatives, obtaining IFR releases from radar controllers, relaying IFR cancellations to radar controller, disseminating Traffic Managementmessages/hazardous weather information, as well as other various duties. * Flight Data 2 (FD2): Assists FD1 as needed.

Her works often present optical illusions, as she experiments with light and movement through mirrors. Having worked on sculptural installations, performance and video art, Abedinirad has explored the pivotal concept of self-identity in the broader context of society. In 2016, she authored a book titled Conceptual Art & Fashion Design in the 21st Century, which was published by Nazar Art Publication in Iran.  Early life and education  Abedinirad was born in 1986 in Tabriz, Iran. Beginning her art career with painting, she has studied Fashion and Textile Design at Dr Shariaty University in Tehran. The principal focus of her dissertation was conceptual art and the ways in which it relates to fashion. She has also studied video art under the supervision of the Iranian filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami who selected her along with a few other artists to participate in his workshop at IBAFF Film Festival in Murcia, Spain, in 2013. At the closing ceremony of the Festival, Abedinirad presented a performance art piece which she dedicated to the American video artist Bill Viola in his presence at the event. In 2014, Abedinirad was awarded a one-year artist scholarship to engage in the cultural projects of Benetton’s Fabrica research centre in Treviso, Italy.  Works  Abedinirad explores complex human issues through her symbolic works. Her installations examine the connections between human beings and nature. Both desert and industrial places were used as the settings for Evocation (2013) and Heaven on Earth (2014) mirror installations, in which numerous mirrors were embedded on the ground to reflect the sky above. Creating skyward reflections through mirrors, Abedinirad sought to display the relationship between the human mind and the natural elements. The mirrors were particularly used to symbolise water in the middle of Iran’s dry land and Italy’s man-made structures. In August 2015, Abedinirad completed her Mirrored Ziggurat installation as part of the Underbelly Arts Festival in Sydney, Australia. Inspired by the pyramidal structure of ziggurats in ancient Mesopotamia, this installation distorts the viewers’ perception and presents a transformative view of the self. In October 2015, Abedinirad collaborated with the Italian interaction designer Gugo Torelli on a project called Babel Tower. The sculpture built from glass boxes sat for a few days in Dasht-e Kavir, a desert in the central Iranian Plateau. Powered by an Arduino processor, the tower sensed changes in weather conditions that added a kinetic feature to its nine tiers. The sculpture was inspired by an old utopian ideal appearing in the Biblical story Genesis 11. As Abedinirad explained: “[This] is an interactive installation that recontextualises the spiritual architecture of the Tower of Babel with modern materials.” This artwork was selected as the eight remote installations published by Wired magazine in March 2017. In December 2017, its photograph was also published by Stanford University Press as the cover of a book titled Archaeology of Babel. Not only do Mirrored Ziggurat and Babel Tower bring humans and Nature closer together like her previous works, but they also create a union of ancient history with today’s world.  Exhibitions  In 2015, Abedinirad’s Mirrored Zuggurat was featured on Cockatoo Island, Australia, for the two-day Underbelly Arts Festival. In 2016, her Sulūk sculpture was put on display on One Belt One Road Visual Arts Exhibition taking place at Sotheby’s Hong Kong Gallery. Organised by the Hong Kong Federation of Women, the event illustrated the importance of female visual artists among the Belt and Road nations across Asia, Europe and Africa. Among other artists whose works were exhibited in this Gallery were Yayoi Kusama and Joana Vasconcelos. The exhibition explored the ties between the ancient Silk Road and the Belt and Road Initiative.http://epaper.chinadailyasia.com/pools/2-20160401-026.pdf From April–July 2017, Abedinirad’s video art Gliss was displayed in Andorra Land Art International Biennale. From August–September 2017, she collaborated with Dionne Lee on a video exhibition titled Eleven and a Half Hours, which was featured at Aggregate Space Gallery in West Oakland. Curated by Shaghayegh Cyrous, the exhibition focused on striking similarities in the everyday lives of the two Iranian and American women, even though their locations and cultures were different. In the same year, the video of her Babel Tower was exhibited at FILE ANIMA+ Electronic Language International Festival in São Paulo, Brazil. Since October 2017, In Between (Part II): So Far has been on view at Mana Contemporary which offers six installations by six women that work to shape Iranian contemporary video art. Displaying Abedinirad’s Passage, the show is the second part of an exhibition series curated by Shahram Karimi. In March 2018, she participated in Lorne Sculpture Biennale showing her Breakwaver installation.

He is regarded as the pioneer of the tariqa in Minangkabau region, as well as the whole Indonesian archipelago.Tangklukan, Abangan, dan Tarekat: Kebangkitan Agama di Jawa Ahmad Syafii Mufid, Yayasan Obor Indonesia. Retrieved 18 August 2013. He was also known as a scholar of Islamic jurisprudence, kalam theology and tasawwuf (science of Islamic mysticism). Biography =Early life= Ismail was born in a religious family and environment. He received the religious education since childhood. After studying the Qur'an in several suraus in his village, he learned the basics of Islamic science through kitab kuning written in Arabic-Malay script. Fields of Islamic science he studied include the jurisprudence, tawhid (science of monotheism), tafsir, hadith, and the sciences of the Arabic language. =Mecca years= Ismail spent 30 years in Mecca for higher education during the 18th century. He went to Mecca to perform the pilgrimage as well as to deepen the Islamic sciences he had previously acquired. He also studied in Medina for five years.Mohammad, Sakinah. Sejarah Kemasukan Tarekat di Malaysia. Retrieved 3 May 2014. In Mecca, Ismail studied under the several renowned scholars who had expertise in their respective fields. He learned kalam theology under Sheikh Muhammad Ibn 'Ali Assyanwani. In the field of jurisprudence, he studied under Sheikh al-Azhar and Sheikh Abdullah ash-Syarqawi, both renowned as scholars of the Shafi'i school of jurisprudence. Ismail also studied the science of Sufism under two great Sufis named Sheikh 'Abdullah Afandi and Sheikh Khalid al-Uthmani al-Kurdi (Sheikh Dhiyauddin Khalid). Both were murshid (teacher of the spirituality) of Naqshbandi order. =Returning to Minangkabau= After studying in Mecca for 30 years, Ismail went back to West Sumatra and began the dissemination of the teachings of Naqshbandi tariqa. He began from his hometown, Simabur in Tanah Datar. The teachings of Ismail then spread outside Minangkabau, reaching places such as Riau, Sultanate of Langkat, Sultanate of Deli, and Sultanate of Johor. He taught tawheed based on Ash'ari and Sunni conception and jurisprudence based on Shafi'i madhhab. Regarding tasawwuf, Ismail followed the Sunni tasawwuf based on the teaching of al-Ghazali. He began to spread the Khalidiyya-Naqshbandi tariqa after it was banned in 1827 by Sheikh Khalid al-Kurdi, one of his teachers in Mecca. During the time, Minangkabau region itself had seen the development of Shattari tariqa propagated by Sheikh Burhanuddin Ulakan earlier. Burhanuddin had developed the congregation for the first time in the archipelago in the 17th century. The latter tariqa, however, did not preclude Ismail's efforts in developing the Khalidiyya-Naqshbandi order. Both tariqas had developed in Minangkabau society, in which they gained footholds in different regions, with Shattari tariqa in the coastal regions and Naqshbandi tariqa in inland regions.Dobbin, 1992: 146 See also *Islam in West Sumatra References Bibliography *Dobbin, Christine.

Shahberdiyeva was born in Kerki, Lebap Province. She was orphaned at age 7, was raised in the orphanage in Mary, and in childhood was harassed by schoolboys who threw rocks at her due to her status as an orphan. Upon admission to the Turkmen Music Boarding School, she began to study violin. In her youth she had learned to play the gyjak. However, upon admission to the Pedagogical Institute, she was denied admission to the violin program and told to matriculate in the Mathematics Department of Turkmen State University. Shahberdiyeva demonstrated her vocal talent to the instructors, and was admitted to the Music Department as a student of voice. After one year, she was transferred to Moscow to study at the Moscow State Tchaikovsky Conservatory. A coloratura soprano, she graduated from the conservatory in 1956, and beginning in 1962 she received further vocal lessons in Kiev. Later in life, she recalled, \\"It [music] completely changed my life.” She was a featured soloist on the roster of the Turkmen Opera and Ballet Theater from 1956. Her repertoire included the title role in The Snow Maiden by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov; Marfa in The Tsar's Bride, also by Rimsky-Korsakov; Rosina in Il barbiere di Siviglia by Gioacchino Rossini; Violetta in La traviata by Giuseppe Verdi; the title role in Lakmé by Léo Delibes; Aylar in The End of the Bloody Watershed by Veli Mukhatov; Aknabat in Night of Alarm by Aman Agadzhikov; and Shasenem in Shasenem and Gharib by Adrian Shaposhnikov. She also performed in concert. During her career Shahberdiyeva traveled abroad as well as performing domestically. She was also named a deputy to the sixth and seventh convocations of the Supreme Soviet of the Turkmen SSR. She became an instructor at the Ashgabat Institute of Arts in 1975, the same year in which she was named a People's Artist of the USSR; she was also honored as a People's Artist of the Turkmen SSR for her work. After Turkmenistan became independent in 1991, Shahberdiyeva continued to receive recognition from the government of Turkmenistan only following the death of Turkmenistan's first president, Saparmurat Niyazov, who banned opera and ballet as non-Turkmen, and closed the opera theater. During that period, until Niyazov's death in 2006, she taught voice to a small circle of students but performed only in private gatherings. She was the subject of a documentary which was shown in Ashgabat in 2008. In 2010, on occasion of her 80th birthday, she received the Golden Age Award, 3rd Degree, from the government.

It conducted assassinations of members of the Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation and Slovene Partisans. The organization's main goal was the elimination of \\"communism and its proponents\\". It is often regarded as associated with the Catholic Church and Slovene Home Guard. Background The historic record regarding the Black Hand is sparse. Sources originating in the Yugoslav period often bear strong ideological condemnatory undertones. The Black Hand is sometimes referred to as the \\"Slovene Gestapo\\" (and possibly collaborated with the Gestapo in some instances, though to what extent, if any, is uncertain). Its name may have been derived from a \\"Serbian military tradition\\". The organization's activities commenced in the autumn of 1943 with its first acts carried out in Jesenice, and Bled region. Its activities in Ljubljana began in March 1944 and later spread to other regions as well. Some sources trace the Black Hand's inception to a February 1944 meeting of various anti-Partisan and Nazi leaders that allegedly took place in Trieste. The Black Hand was likely in no way connected to the German occupying forces, which were often exasperated by the anarchic and unsupervised nature of Black Hand's activities and purportedly often demanded reports of its activities or even arrested and interrogated its operatives after the killings. Members were often young and pious men from a rural background who likely joined the group due to the influence of local religious authorities. Members were often also associated with the Slovene Home Guard, Chetniks, and clerical groups. Black Hand justified its actions as a defense of religion/faith. After the war, many former Black Hand members evaded justice and escaped, though some were convicted and sentenced to death. Killings Black Hand operatives usually carried out assassinations by breaking into victims' houses at night, sometimes executing the targets in front of their families. Victims were often killed in their beds, or were first led away under the pretense of being taken to an interrogation. The corpses were then often mutilated beyond recognition and thrown into Ljubljanica or Sava rivers. According to some accounts, the assassins used police cars during their activities. The assassins were often clad in black clothes, or, sometimes, Partisan uniforms, and often concealed their faces. The assassins often left behind leaflets with a print of a black hand, or impressed a black hand print on a wall, and left messages that blamed victims' alleged support for communism as the reason for the killing, and exalted the ideals of nation and faith. Common \\"mottos\\" included \\"Death to the Liberation Front!\\" (Slovene: \\"Smrt OF!\\"), and \\"You escaped once, you won't the second time. Death to communism!\\" (Slovene: \\"Enkrat si ušel, drugič ne boš. Smrt komunizmu!\\"). The organization may have had police and Home Guard informants. Victims were often suspected members or supporters of the Liberation Front (sometimes eminent individuals) whose connection with the group could not be proven. Black Hand also carried out torture, intimidation, interrogations, and the surreptitious killings of Slovene Home Guard's prisoners, which formally had to be handed over to the German occupying forces after their apprehension and interrogation. Germans usually deported their POWs to concentration camps, while the Home Guard desired a more severe and immediate \\"punishment\\" for its captives.

She grew up in a mansion on Emerald Hill. Kon's mother, Kheng Lim (or Rosie Seow), was an actress who inspired her daughter's love of theatre. Kon's father, Lim Kok Ann, got Kon interested in science and literature. Kon was also related to Lim Boon Keng and Tan Tock Seng who were her maternal great-grandfather and paternal great-great grandfather respectively. Kon attended Raffles Girls' School and then went on to the University of Singapore, where she earned a degree in philosophy. In 1967, after she was married, she moved to Malaysia for fifteen years.

Kon won the Singapore National Playwriting Competition for three plays: The Bridge (1977), The Trial (1982) and for Emily of Emerald Hill (1983). Emily of Emerald Hill is a one-woman play that debuted in 1984 and was directed by Chin San Sooi. The melodrama follows the life of a Peranakan woman who is married into a family she doesn't know at age 14 to a man twice her age. The story was primarily inspired by Kon's grandmother, but also includes stories drawn from the rest of her extended family. The Herald Sun wrote that the writing in Emily was \\"colorful and smartly written.\\" The Honolulu Star- Bulletin wrote that \\"The play is rich with the details of everyday life in a well-to-do Singaporeean Chinese family.\\" The play was performed at the Commonwealth Arts Festival and the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 1986.

She performed as a concert pianist in New York, Mexico and Cuba for several years before turning to teaching. Several of her pupils became distinguished musicians. Early years Margot Rojas was born in Veracruz, Mexico on 24 March 1903. Her mother was Cuban and her father Mexican. She started her musical studies at the age of five under her aunt, Consuelo Mendoza. In 1912 she moved with her family to Havana, where she continued her studies at the Hubert de Blanck Conservatory. She was taught theory by José Molina Torres and Rafaela Serrano, and was taught piano by Consuelo Quesada and Hubert de Blanck. In Cuba in 1913 the public performances of Ernesto Lecuona and Dulce María Serret made a great impression on her. She graduated from Hubert de Blanck's piano classes in 1916. Performer In 1919 Margot went to New York City and studied under Alexander Lambert, who had himself studied under Franz Liszt in Weimar. She accompanied the violinist Joseph Joachim, and performed at the Steinway Hall. On her way back to Cuba she performed in Mexico City at the Sala Wagner and the Palacio de Bellas Artes. At the start of the 1920s Margot launched in a career as a concert player in Cuba, giving recitals in Santiago de Cuba and Camagüey. Margot Rojas first performed in public in Cuba in 1920 with a recital in the Sala Espadero of the Hubert de Blanck Conservatory. She played on 20 October 1923 at the Teatro Nacional de Cuba. On 30 November 1924 she performed Frédéric Chopin's Piano Concerto No. 1 as first soloist with the Havana Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Pedro Sanjuán Nortes. Margot made a second trip to New York to receive master classes from leading pianists. After her return, on 16 March 1930 she performed Sergei Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 with the Havana Symphony Orchestra directed by Gonzalo Roig. She was 27 years old. She was persecuted for her progressive opinions, and had to return to Mexico under the \\"machadato\\" regime of Gerardo Machado. From 1933 to 1937 she lived in Mexico and performed in the Sala del Conservatorio Nacional in the Palacio de Bellas Artes. She performed in recitals for two pianos with Ernesto Lecuona and Margot de Blanck. Teacher After Machado was overthrown Margot returned to Cuba and started to teach as a member of the faculty of the \\"International Conservatory\\" that had recently been founded by María Jones de Castro. Soon after she also worked for Hubert de Blanck and in the Colegio Phillips, where she conducted a choir. Teaching provided a stable source of income compared to concert appearances, for which there was limited demand. She made her last public performance in 1957. After the Cuban Revolution of 1959 she was appointed to the Piano Chair at the Amadeo Roldán Conservatory and was asked to teach in the recently created Escuela Nacional de Arte (National School of Art).

The two countries established diplomatic relations on 9 June 1992. Bilateral ties have advanced gradually since then and mostly focused on economic cooperation. China has an embassy in Tbilisi, and Georgia has an embassy in Beijing. By 2017, China had become Georgia's fourth largest trading partner and the second largest exporting market for Georgian wine. China has been appreciative of Georgia's commitment to One-China policy and has supported Georgia's territorial integrity by refusing to recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia.  History  The Yuan Shi, the official history of the Yuan Dynasty of China, records the fate of Georgia in 1252. In that year, the Mongol khagan Möngke, who was expanding into China, granted the Kingdom of Georgia, which had submitted to Mongol overlordship, to Berke. Chu'ü-erh-chih, the Chinese name used for Georgia in the Yuan Shi, is etymologically the same as \\"Georgia\\".Thomas T. Allsen, Culture and Conquest in Mongol Eurasia (Cambridge University Press, 2001), p. 54.  Political ties  The China–Georgia relations were officially established on 9 June 1992, when China extended its diplomatic recognition to the Republic of Georgia after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Eduard Shevardnadze, then Georgia's head of state, paid a state visit to China in June 1993 and signed several agreements, principally on economic and trade cooperation. Mikheil Saakashvili, the then- President of Georgia, was in China on an official visit in April 2006. The two countries maintained communication and coordination at the United Nations and other international organizations. Georgia has maintained its \\"one-China policy\\" and does not recognize Taiwan. In its turn, China, member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), refused to follow the suit of Russia, a fellow SCO member, in recognition of the independence of Georgia's breakaway Abkhazia and South Ossetia in the aftermath of the August 2008 Russo–Georgian War despite the appeal by the Russian Foreign Ministry. Instead, the SCO issued the Dushanbe Declaration, calling on all parties to solve the \\"existing problems\\" through diplomacy. Similarly, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman expressed the agency's concern due to the \\"latest development in South Ossetia and Abkhazia\\", responding to a journalist's question regarding China's position on Russia's recognition of the disputed territories. In the view of the political analyst Joseph Larsen, \\"while China does not present an alternative to NATO and EU integration... relations with China have the potential to complement Georgia's existing foreign policy.\\"  Economic ties  Bilateral economic ties have gradually expanded since 1992 and witnessed further growth beginning in 2010 as Georgia's economy recovered from the 2008 war. China views Georgia as part of the One Belt One Road Initiative, a project it launched in 2013 to \\"shorten the distance between China and Europe\\" through improved infrastructure connections. By 2014, China had accounted for $217.94 million in foreign direct investment in Georgia, putting it in fourth place after Azerbaijan, the Netherlands, and the United States. A number of Chinese companies have launched major operations in Georgia.

Since she left she has formed her own company, Kaizen House, with the intention of opening her first restaurant, Shibui, in 2018. Career Born in Singapore and raised in Maidenhead, Haigh is Singaporean on her mother's side and English on her father's. She never thought about a career in cooking as a child, and instead trained as an architect at Central St Martin's, London. While there, she realised that she preferred to cook, and was dared to apply to appear on the BBC television series MasterChef. The 2011 series was her first experience of cooking outside of her home or for her friends. She was eliminated early on in the series after producing a smoked duck dish when asked to make a roast dinner: although the resident judges liked the dish, the guest judge said that the smoke flavour was overpowering. Haigh decided to continue to pursue a career in cooking, and started to work at a gastropub called The Green Oak in Windsor. After learning the basics there, she moved to the Royal Oak, Paley Street, where she came under the influence of head chef, Dominic Chapman. While she was working there, she attended culinary classes at Westminster Kingsway College on her day off each week for three years. She went on to work at a variety of restaurants, but learnt most at Neil Rankin's Smokehouse restaurant, where she became joint head chef. She complained to Neil: ‘I’m fed up with being put on pastry because I’m a girl’.\\" So, he taught her how to butcher and barbecue meat, which she is now evangelistic about. In 2015, she was invited by James Ramsden and Sam Herlihy to be head chef at Pidgin, which she co-founded with them, their Hackney based restaurant following on from their supper club, the Secret Larder. Shortly after Pidgin was awarded a star in the 2017 Michelin Guide, she left. She set up a company called Kaizen House, under which she plans to launch her own restaurant Shibui in 2018. The restaurant will feature wood fired cooking with elements from different cuisines.

He subsequently released the mixtape Day69 (2018), which was supported by the singles \\"Kooda\\", \\"Keke\\", and \\"Gotti\\", all of which charted on the Billboard Hot 100. \\"Fefe\\", featuring Nicki Minaj and Murda Beatz, a single from his debut album Dummy Boy (2018), peaked at number three on the Hot 100. Despite negative critical reception, Dummy Boy was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In 2015, 6ix9ine pled guilty to a felony count of use of a child in a sexual performance and received a four-year probation period and a 1,000-hour community service order. In 2018, he was arrested on racketeering, weapons, and drugs charges. He pled guilty to nine charges including conspiracy to commit murder and armed robbery in February 2019, and was given a two-year prison sentence after testifying for the prosecution. In April 2020, he was granted early release during the COVID-19 pandemic following fears over his vulnerability to the disease due to his asthma condition. He was put on house arrest for the remainder of his term. After his release from prison, his single \\"Gooba\\" debuted and peaked at number three in the US, and \\"Trollz\\", his third collaboration with Minaj, debuted at number one in the country. His second album, TattleTales (2020), debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200. Early life Daniel Hernandez was born on May 8, 1996, in Bushwick, Brooklyn, New York City to a mother from Atlixco, Mexico, and a father from Río Piedras, Puerto Rico. His father is also named Daniel Hernandez. His mother, Natividad Perez-Hernandez, came to the U.S. in 1988 to seek a better life and opportunity; she was a factory worker and house cleaner. She is also a diabetic and has had an operation on four hernias. Hernandez played baseball and soccer throughout his youth. He was assigned to a major league soccer team at 13 but his mother declined because she did not trust a stranger taking her son at a young age. Hernandez has an older brother, Oscar Osiris Hernandez (born August 25, 1994). Hernandez has his first name tattooed on the right side of his head. Hernandez and his older brother Oscar were raised in a church throughout their youth. Hernandez would sing during mass and was selected many times to read from the Bible, his favorite passage was Psalm 121. For elementary school, he attended Public School 59, for middle school, he attended Juan Morel Campos Secondary School, and for high school, he attended Legacy High School. He left high school around the tenth grade. Hernandez did not know his father until he was 9 years old, and had only a brief relationship with him. Hernandez's mother told him he was dead, according to Hernandez's father. Hernandez's father was a heroin addict and was in prison for five years for selling drugs. Hernandez's stepfather was shot dead steps away from the family home in 2010.\\"Open Space: Tekashi69 - YouTube\\" . Interview with Mass Appeal, published August 3, 2017. See minute 4:09. After the murder of his stepfather, Hernandez's mother wasn't able to make enough money working to support her children. She applied for welfare, and there were many nights Hernandez and his brother went to bed without dinner. Due to his mother's financial struggle, Hernandez and his brother wore used clothes and Hernandez had to share a bed with his mother. Emotionally disturbed by the death of his stepfather, Hernandez would not shower or eat to the point where he lost a lot of weight, he was given therapy and was hospitalized for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Hernandez also started to act out due to his stepfather's death and was eventually expelled from school in the 8th grade for bad behavior.\\"The 6IX9INE Interview - YouTube\\" . Interview with No Jumper, published July 24, 2017. See minutes 20:34–22:32. Rather than continuing his education, he started working at various jobs such as being a busboy and a delivery boy at a grocery store to help his mother financially. Music career =2012–2016: Early career= Hernandez first decided to rap in 2012 after meeting Peter \\"Righteous P\\" Rodgers, CEO of New York record label Hikari-Ultra, when he came into the vegan bodega Hernandez was working at in Bushwick, Brooklyn and asked if Hernandez rapped based on his appearance, stating that he thought he had the image of a rapper and suggested that he rap because of this, along with Hernandez' cadence. Hernandez began releasing rap songs in 2014, starting with \\"69\\" in August 2014, \\"Pimpin\\", in September 2014, and \\"4769\\", in October 2014, which was his first collaboration as a lead artist featuring two rappers from the Brooklyn collective Pro Era, J.A.B. and Dirty Sanchez. Over the next three years, he released multiple tracks and videos with titles such as \\"Scumlife\\", \\"Yokai\\", and \\"Hellsing Station\\", drawing attention for his aggressive rapping style and use of anime as music video visuals. Many of his early songs were released by FCK THEM, a music label based in Slovakia. Gathering fame as an internet meme for his rainbow-dyed hair, extensive tattoos and rainbow-plated grills, he eventually became an associate of fellow New York rapper ZillaKami, the younger half-brother of Righteous P. They later feuded after Hernandez allegedly stole instrumentals and songs they had made together. Soon after Hernandez began working with Andrew Green a rapper known as TrifeDrew, again, who had previously worked with him on music videos to work on videos again along with music. =2017–2018: Day69 and Dummy Boy= left \\"Poles1469\\", released in April 2017, featured Hernandez alongside Trippie Redd on YouTube. Hernandez rose to prominence on social media due to a July 2017 Instagram post that went viral on both Reddit and Twitter. Hernandez's commercial debut single \\"Gummo\\" was released on November 10, 2017, and eventually peaked at number 12 on the US Billboard Hot 100.\\"Billboard Hot 100: December 30, 2017\\" . Billboard. It was certified platinum by the RIAA on March 5, 2018. His next single, \\"Kooda\\", debuted at number 61 on the Hot 100 the week of December 23, 2017.\\"Billboard Hot 100: December 23, 2017\\" . Billboard. On January 14, 2018, Hernandez released his third single, \\"Keke\\", with Fetty Wap and A Boogie wit da Hoodie, which also charted on the Hot 100. Shortly afterward, Hernandez announced his debut mixtape, Day69. The mixtape was released on February 23, 2018, and debuted at number 4 on the Billboard 200 album chart with 55,000 album-equivalent units, of which 20,000 were pure sales. According to Jon Caramanica of The New York Times, the tape was an outgrowth of the \\"SoundCloud rap explosion\\", and was notable for its willingness to deviate from hip hop's prevailing sound. After the release of Day69, two songs from the album, \\"Billy\\" and \\"Rondo\\" both debuted on the Billboard Hot 100, with \\"Billy\\" peaking at number 50 and \\"Rondo\\" at number 73. In April 2018, Hernandez released \\"Gotti\\", a remix of a feature he did for artist Packman titled \\"Got it, Got it\\". The song's video was released on April 16, 2018, and involved footage of Hernandez donating bundles of $100 bills to poor citizens in the Dominican Republic. The song was added to Day69 as a deluxe song and debuted at number 99 on the Billboard Hot 100 before dropping off the following week, making it his sixth consecutive Hot 100 entry. Hernandez stirred up controversy in May 2018 when he was involved in a shooting with the entourage of fellow New York rapper Casanova as part of a feud; this led to Hernandez losing a $5 million headphone deal and being banned from the Barclays Center. After the shooting, Hernandez stopped releasing music for several months, before releasing \\"Tati\\", featuring DJ Spinking in June, which debuted at number 43 on the Billboard Hot 100. 6ix9ine during a performance in alt= In July 2018, Hernandez released his eighth single, \\"Fefe\\", featuring Nicki Minaj and Murda Beatz; the single debuted at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 before peaking at number three in its second week, marking Hernandez's highest entry on the chart and his first single to reach the top five of the Hot 100. \\"Fefe\\" was later certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. His subsequent singles, \\"Bebe\\" and \\"Stoopid\\", also reached the top 30 of the Hot 100. In September 2018, Hernandez signed a publishing deal with LA-based music company Create Music Group. In early October 2018, Hernandez was featured on the song \\"Aulos Reloaded\\" with French house DJ Vladimir Cauchemar and \\"Kick\\" with Danish singer Jimilian. On November 7, 2018, it was announced that his debut studio album, Dummy Boy, was to be released on November 23, but on November 21, it was announced that the album would be postponed. The album was ultimately released without notice on November 27, on all streaming services. Despite generally negative critical reception, the album became his highest-charting, after debuting at number two on the Billboard 200 behind Travis Scott's Astroworld. While in jail, 6ix9ine was featured on previous collaborator A Boogie wit da Hoodie's song \\"Swervin\\", peaking at number 27 on the Hot 100, off his sophomore album Hoodie SZN. The song was released on December 21, 2018, alongside the album. =2019–present: Return to music and TattleTales= In October 2019, Hernandez signed a two- album contract for over $10 million with his label 10K Projects for one album in English and one album in Spanish. In April 2020, Hernandez had to request permission from a judge to film a video in his backyard while in home confinement, and was subsequently granted permission. On May 7, 2020, Hernandez announced he would be releasing a new single on May 8, 2020, marking his return to music, and on his 24th birthday. The song, titled \\"Gooba\\", was released alongside a music video. According to Pitchfork's Madison Bloom, the track includes references to COVID-19 (\\"They sick, been hot, way before coronavirus\\") and Hernandez's cooperation with federal prosecutors and testimony (\\"Tell me how I ratted, came home to a big bag\\"). Hernandez announced after several delays his next single \\"Trollz\\", a collaboration with Nicki Minaj, which was released on June 12, 2020. The song debuted at the top of the Hot 100, marking 6ix9ine's first number-one single. \\"Trollz\\" fell to number 34 in its second week, breaking the record for largest position drop from number one in the charts history. A third single, \\"Yaya\\", was released on July 3, 2020. It debuted at number 99 on the Billboard Hot 100 and dropped out of the charts the following week. A fourth single, \\"Punani\\", was released on August 2. The songs are all included on his second studio album, TattleTales, which was released on September 4, 2020. Musical style and influences Hernandez's music is generally categorized as hip hop, or more specifically, scream rap, hardcore hip hop, SoundCloud rap, and punk rap, often incorporating elements of drill, heavy metal, hardcore punk, grime, crunk, trap music, and reggaeton. He cites influences including DMX, Tupac Shakur, The Notorious B.I.G., and 50 Cent. Personal life Hernandez can speak Spanish; he sung in Spanish on three tracks, \\"Bebe\\" and \\"Mala\\" with Puerto Rican rapper Anuel AA in 2018, then \\"Yaya\\" in 2020. Hernandez suffers from asthma. Hernandez was raised as a Christian. In an interview with American radio personality Angie Martinez, he stated: \\"I pray a lot; I always thank God for good situations. Every time there's a good situation, there's a cell in my brain that says: 'Say thank you to God'. ... Before I blew up, for a year and a half—400 and something days—I literally prayed everyday while walking my dog Titus. I would pray every day: God, please change my life ... God, please change my life; I'm a good kid. Please change my life. I got a baby; I can't even buy her pampers ... please change my life, please change my life—and then 'Gummo' came and life changed. And then I was like damn, God is real. I knew if I prayed every day it would work, because God is real. And my life has changed.\\" On March 23, 2018, Hernandez conducted a radio interview on The Breakfast Club, alongside Australian pastor Brian Houston. In this interview, the pastor held hands with Hernandez and prayed for him; asking God to help Hernandez makes wise decisions and to bless his family. At 18 years old, Hernandez conceived a daughter, Saraiyah Hernandez (born October 29, 2015), with Sara Molina (born January 17, 1996). A few weeks before Hernandez headed to prison at the end of 2018, he began dating Jade, whose real name is Rachel Watley. She has Hernandez's face tattooed twice on her body. On October 1, 2020, Hernandez was reportedly hospitalised after having an overdose from mixing two Hydroxycut diet pills with a McDonald's McCafé coffee. He has claimed that he gained more than 200lbs during his time in prison but has said that using the medication had helped him shed 30lbs since he was released. His lawyer denies the overdose claim. Legal issues =Child sexual performance charges= Hernandez was involved in a child sexual performance charge from 2015. In October 2015, Hernandez pled guilty to a felony count of use of a child in a sexual performance. He was charged with three counts of the offense after a February 2015 incident in which he had physical contact with a 13-year-old girl and later distributed videos of the incident online as part of a music video. Three videos are described in the criminal complaint against Hernandez. In the first, \\"the child engages in oral sexual intercourse with the separately charged defendant Taquan Anderson, while the defendant, Daniel Hernandez, stands behind the child making a thrusting motion with his pelvis and smacking her on her buttocks. The child is nude in the video.\\" The other videos show the child sitting on Hernandez's lap while Anderson gropes her breasts, and later sitting naked across the laps of Anderson and Hernandez. In a November 2017 interview, Hernandez claimed to have had \\"no sexual contact\\" with the girl and denied knowing she was a minor. Hernandez also claimed to have been 17 at the time of the incident, though the birth date listed in the complaint against him and in his statement to the police shows he was 18. Under his plea deal, Hernandez must obtain his GED, refrain from posting sexually explicit or violent images of women or children to social media, and not commit another crime for two years, among other injunctions. If met, the plea deal will give Hernandez three years' probation and he will not have to register as a sex offender; if not, Hernandez could face up to three years in prison. In a January 2018 court hearing, it was revealed that Hernandez had failed his GED test, but had his sentencing postponed until April 10, 2018. The court date was later postponed, reportedly because the court did not have a copy of Hernandez's GED. Prior to his sexual misconduct charges, Hernandez served jail time as a minor for assault and the sale of heroin. Due to his continuing legal problems in light of his plea bargain, the Manhattan district attorney's office announced Hernandez could face up to three years in prison and possible sex offender registration for his 2015 case, but he was instead sentenced to four years of probation starting in October 2018, with one clause being that he cannot utter the phrase \\"Treyway\\" in public as it was deemed to promote gang activity, as well as 1,000 hours of community service. On October 27, 2018, two members of Hernandez's entourage were involved in a shooting in Manhattan and were subsequently charged with gang assault. =Choking incident at shopping mall= On July 12, 2018, Hernandez was arrested in New York for an outstanding warrant related to an incident where he allegedly choked a 16-year-old in The Galleria shopping mall in Houston, Texas, in January 2018. All charges were eventually dropped after the teenager decided not to take legal action. =Robbery, assault and kidnapping incident= In the early morning hours of July 22, 2018, Hernandez was kidnapped, beaten, and robbed by three armed assailants in Brooklyn. He had finished shooting the music video for \\"FEFE\\" (featuring Nicki Minaj and Murda Beatz) when the assailants grabbed him outside his home and pistol-whipped him. The robbers eventually took over $750,000 in custom jewelry and approximately $35,000 in cash. Hernandez escaped from their vehicle and summoned police help via a stranger. He was taken to the hospital. In February 2019, Nine Trey Gangsters member Anthony \\"Harv\\" Ellison was indicted for the July kidnapping and assault. On October 3, Ellison was found guilty. =Chief Keef shooting= On June 2, 2018, Chief Keef was fired upon outside the W Hotel in New York City but not hit; no injuries resulted from the incident. Due to the ongoing feud, Hernandez was confirmed to be under investigation by the New York Police Department for possible involvement with the incident, despite being in Los Angeles at the time. In February 2019, Hernandez pled guilty to ordering the shooting of Chief Keef. Hernandez offered his associate Kintea \\"Kooda B\\" McKenzie $20,000 to shoot at Chief Keef. =Domestic violence and alleged sexual assault= On September 10, 2019, Hernandez admitted to years of domestic violence in a cooperation agreement. A section of Hernandez's cooperation agreement with the government, which had not previously been made public, listed a number of crimes that he committed, and for which the government agreed not to prosecute him. On the list, explained Judge Paul Engelmayer, was that Hernandez \\"admits domestic violence from 2011 to November, 2018.\\" Accusations of domestic violence against Hernandez first came to light in early 2019, including a detailed Daily Beast article that featured testimony from the rapper's ex- girlfriend (and the mother of his daughter), Sara Molina, that he beat her over a period of seven years—a timeline that corresponds to Hernandez's own admission, though no names of victims were mentioned in court. Molina told the Daily Beast about numerous incidents of abuse, including one beating in Dubai that left her face so swollen that she says, \\"I could barely open my eyes.\\" Molina also told the Daily Beast that Hernandez boasted about being a sex addict. Meanwhile, Molina said Hernandez falsely accused her of sleeping with Kifano “Shotti” Jordan, his manager who reportedly recruited Hernandez to become a member of the violent Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods street gang. When Molina denied cheating on him, she says he punched her out of nowhere, driving \\"a hair extension into her scalp.\\" \\"I was leaking blood,\\" she said. \\"There was blood on the hotel pillow cases. He got scared.\\" Molina told the Daily Beast that she didn't report the assaults to the police, though she provided the news outlet with photos she said were taken shortly after the attacks, showing bruises and cuts. She continued to detail that Hernandez proceeded “beating me for two hours straight,” she claims “He punched me so hard in my right ear I thought I was deaf.” Molina describes that Hernandez punched, kicked and choked her, leaving her with two black eyes and multiple bruises. She then went on to detail that he sexually assaulted her next morning, “He woke up, forced me to have sex with him,” she said. “I cried.” Molina described another incident that took place in April 2017, in which 6ix9ine beat her in a car in front of her daughter, then a year old, who started screaming and crying. Molina alleges that after she questioned Hernandez about a stripper he had been hanging out with, “He dragged me by my hair and slapped me in my face,” which resulted in a black eye. Hernandez admitted physically abusing his ex- girlfriend again in an interview with The New York Times in 2020. =Trial of the Nine Trey Gangsters= On November 16, 2018, Hernandez made his second appearance on The Breakfast Club radio show, in which he notably stated: \\"There's only one thing I fear in life. No, two things. I fear God, and I fear the FBI.\\" On November 18, 2018, Hernandez, his former faux-manager Kifano \\"Shotti\\" Jordan, and three other associates were arrested. Hernandez is charged with federal RICO and firearms charges, including conspiracy to murder and armed robbery, and faces up to life in prison. He is allegedly part of \\"a violent sect of the Bloods\\" known as the Nine Trey Gangsters. Hernandez's attorney, Lance Lazzaro, advocated for bail for his client on the condition that Hernandez surrender his passport, pay a little under $2 million for bail, and be placed under house arrest, but the judge denied bail, keeping Hernandez in custody that he may still be a danger to the community even if those bail conditions were met. Hernandez's legal team plans to appeal that decision. He was held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn under general population before being moved to another facility due to security reasons, as Hernandez had multiple altercations with fellow prisoners, including those belonging to the Crips street gang. On February 1, 2019, Hernandez pled guilty to nine charges. He was due to be sentenced on January 24, 2020, and faced a possible mandatory sentence of 47 years in prison. On February 16, a plea deal document revealed that the rapper could avoid jail time in exchange for his willingness to testify against fellow gang members in concurrent investigations. On December 18, 2019, Hernandez was given a sentence of 2 years after testifying against the Nine Trey Gang. Judge Paul Engelmayer gave Hernandez credit for helping prosecutors send several violent gang members to prison and 13 months time served. On December 18, 2019, Hernandez's father showed up to his court hearing after not seeing him since he was 9 years old. Hernandez didn't notice his father in the room for the first half of the hearing. His father sat in one of the back rows of the courtroom and spent several minutes trying to get his son's attention. After Hernandez finally noticed his father was in the courtroom, he broke down in tears. His father told reporters he wants to repair his relationship with his son. On March 22, 2020, while serving his time in prison, Hernandez requested to serve the remainder of his prison sentence at home stating he was at a higher risk of contracting the COVID-19 virus due to his pre-existing asthma condition. On April 1, 2020 Rolling Stone obtained a letter to the judge from United States Attorney Geoffrey Berman saying that the government does not object to the release of Hernandez early on home confinement. On Thursday, April 2, Hernandez's lawyer, Dawn Florio, confirmed with XXL magazine that the court decided to allow the rapper to be released from prison and into home confinement. He was originally set to be released on August 2, 2020. His home confinement ended on August 1, 2020. Feuds =Trippie Redd= In April 2017, Hernandez and Trippie Redd released their first collaboration, \\"Poles1469\\", and in July 2017, they released another, \\"Owee.\\" Later that year, upon seeing a post from a Twitter account claiming Hernandez was a pedophile following the release of images and information by fellow rapper and Hernandez's detractor ZillaKami, Trippie Redd denounced Hernandez, saying, \\"I'm sorry brozay (sic), 1400 don't promote pedophiles... If we give niggas clout, we give niggas clout. It was an accident.\\" On November 11, 2017, following a series of barbs the two traded on social media, Redd was attacked in the lobby of a New York hotel and blamed Hernandez and his crew in an Instagram live video. Hernandez later insinuated his involvement in an Instagram live video, saying, \\"I don't know what's going on, but your chin is bruised up. You can't just be out here calling people gay, bro. Can't be supporting false accusations, you can't be ranting on Live talking about New York. Fuck these niggas talking about, New York this, New York that, like, you just can't do that bro. You should put some ice on that chin, it's bruised up. I feel bad bro... I just want you to be my friend again,\\" before proceeding to sing the hook from \\"Poles1469\\". He was referencing a post by Trippie Redd that showed Hernandez holding hands with another man with a caption insinuating Hernandez was a homosexual. In February 2018, Hernandez was assaulted by several men outside a Los Angeles airport shortly after arguing with Trippie Redd on Instagram. Their feud continued to escalate with mutual Internet trolling. Hernandez later accused Trippie Redd over Instagram Live of having pedophilic sexual relations with fellow rapper Bhad Bhabie, who was a minor at the time. Trippie Redd denied the allegations, and reiterated Hernandez's conviction for use of a child in sexual performance. Bhad Bhabie also took to Instagram Live to deny the claims, but admitted the two had kissed in the past, saying, \\"We kissed but it wasn't that serious and he was 17 at the time.\\" However, this contradicts an account given by Trippie Redd to the late XXXTentacion regarding the nature of their relationship prior to it being publicly known.XXXTentacion Leaks Information About Trippie Redd Affair With Danielle Bregoli - VladTV Reporting After the dissolution of Trippie Redd's relationship with his then-girlfriend Alexandria Laveglia,Aylek$ Background Information Revealed - Last.FM Reporting known professionally as Aylek$, Hernandez started posting videos of himself with her, hinting at sexual activity between the two6ix9ine taunts Trippie Amid Breakup with Aylek$ - Hot New Hip Hop Reporting6ix9ine in bed with Trippie Redd ex-girlfriend Aylek$ - XXL Reporting6ix9ine Claims to have had Relations with Aylek$ - XXL Reporting After Hernandez's November 2018 federal arrest on RICO charges, Trippie Redd mocked Hernandez's imprisonment in a video of him dancing to the tune of Akon's 2004 hit single \\"Locked Up\\", mimicking a jail scenario.Celebrity reactions 6ix9ine's Federal Arrest - Inquisitr ReportingTrippie Redd trolls 6ix9ine following his Federal Arrest - VladTV Reporting =Chief Keef= Throughout 2018, Hernandez was involved in feuds with a number of Chicago drill artists from the GloGang collective, including Chief Keef, Lil Reese, and Tadoe (Chief Keef's cousin), stemming from domestic abuse and relationship issues relating to fellow rapper Cuban Doll, who was in a relationship with Tadoe but also friendly with Hernandez.

In May 2020, 6ix9ine accused singers Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber of cheating and buying their way to number one on the Billboard Hot 100, after their song \\"Stuck With U\\" debuted at number one while his comeback single, \\"Gooba\\", debuted at number three for the week ending May 23, 2020. He also accused Billboard of chart manipulation. In an Instagram post, 6ix9ine alleged that Grande and Bieber were using \\"six credit cards\\" to purchase 30,000 copies of their song at the last minute. Both Grande and Bieber denied the allegations against them, as well as debunking 6ix9ine's claims of using \\"six credit cards\\", stating that their fans are the ones who bought the songs and explaining that no more than four copies could be purchased. Bieber would address 6ix9ine's claims of that his streams didn't count, stating that \\"he (6ix9ine) is counting his global streams and this is a domestic chart so only domestic streams count\\". Billboard also commented on how they conducted that week's charts, debunking all of 6ix9ine's claims, as well as commenting that the forecast rankings that 6ix9ine had prior to the reveal was false, stating that they do not distribute any of their rankings to labels, management, or artists. In a later interview with The New York Times asking him if he inflates his streams \\"through bots or pre-roll ads or dirty marketing tactics\\", Hernandez stated: Between August and September 2020, 6ix9ine was embroiled in a feud with rappers Lil Durk and Lil Reese, who called the rapper out for snitching against his former associates. 6ix9ine reacted to Lil Durk who claimed 6ix9ine's record label tried to pay him $3 million to continue their dispute. Rapper Lil Tjay made similar claims. Philanthropy In March 2018, Hernandez visited the Dominican Republic to shoot a music video.

Not much is known about this figure, other than his charismatic status. He is also known for his commitment to upholding the Shari'a. From the Dutch record, he was considered an antagonist figure, who was responsible for the violence in the Plateau of Padang. The real name of Tuanku Nan Renceh was Abdullah. He was born in Nagari Kamang in 1780 and died during the Padri War. He was a disciple of the prominent ulama of his time, Tuanku Nan Tuo.Azra, A., (2004), The Origins of Islamic Reformism in Southeast Asia: Networks of Malay-Indonesian and Middle Eastern 'Ulamā' in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries, University of Hawaii Press, . After receiving Tuo's teaching, he became a padri, a group of people who advocated for the puritanical approach in Islam inspired by Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab. He later became the teacher who gave birth to many padri warfighters. The arrival of three pilgrims from Mecca in 1803 inspired Tuanku Nan Renceh. He then began to initiate jihad against all the perceived heresy practiced in Minangkabau society by promoting and the propagation of the Sunnah. His reformist vision on the societal custom including the matriarchal adat (local customary) system was challenged by the penghulus (headman of the traditional Minangkabau society) in some nagaris (traditional settlement), who insisted on fighting for the Minangkabau hereditary tradition, thus giving birth to the branch of padris with the conflicting approach toward the Islamic reform.Susanto, B., Ge(mer)lap Nasionalitas Postkolonial, Kanisius, .

Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Mme Georges Charpentier and Her Children, 1878. The children in this painting are Georgette and Paul. Marguerite Charpentier (March 1, 1848 – November 30, 1904) was a French salonist and art collector who was one of the earliest champions of the Impressionists, especially Pierre-Auguste Renoir. Biography She was born Marguerite Louise Lemonnier in Paris to Alexandre-Gabriel Lemonnier, the court jeweler, and Sophie Raymonde (née Duchâtenet). In 1871, she married the publisher Georges Charpentier and they had four children: Georgette, Marcel, Paul, and Jeanne. On Fridays from the mid 1870s to the early 1890s, Charpentier ran a political and literary salon at her house to which she invited writers, artists, musicians, actors, and politicians. Among those who attended were writers represented by her husband, including Gustave Flaubert, Alphonse Daudet, Guy de Maupassant, Théodore de Banville, Joris-Karl Huysmans, and Émile Zola. Artists who came ranged from traditional realists like Carolus-Duran and Jean-Jacques Henner to Impressionists such as Édouard Manet, Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, Alfred Sisley, Gustave Caillebotte, and Pierre- Auguste Renoir. Other visitors included the art critic Théodore Duret, the art collector Charles Ephrussi, the composers Camille Saint-Saëns and Jules Massenet, and the actor Sarah Bernhardt. Charpentier and her husband amassed a small but significant collection of paintings, mostly by French Impressionist painters. In 1875, Charpentier acquired three Impressionist paintings by Renoir, making her one of the first art collectors to buy Impressionist work. Renoir executed half a dozen commissioned portraits of Charpentier and her family, and even described himself at one point as the Charpentiers' \\"private painter\\". His 1878 portrait of Charpentier and two of her children was acclaimed at the 1879 Paris Salon, and the writer Marcel Proust refers to this painting in the last volume of his novel cycle In Search of Lost Time. In the early 1880s, Georges Charpentier's publishing firm ran into financial difficulties and the Charpentiers were forced to sell off part of the art collection. After Marguerite Charpentier died in 1904 and Georges in 1905, their surviving children auctioned the remainder of the art collection. Some of it is now in major museums, including the Musée d'Orsay and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

He operated the NWA's Iowa territory, one of the primary members of the NWA based in Des Moines. Described by Sam Muchnick as the father of the NWA George was inducted into the NWA Hall of Fame in 2014. Early life Georgeacopoulos was born to Greek parents Limberis \\"Louis\\" and Elizabeth Bolanis Georgeacopoulos in Lowell, Massachusetts on January 22, 1905. When he was a teenager he and his family (including younger brother Andrew) relocated to Black Hawk County, Iowa, where their surname was changed to \\"George\\". After completing school, Pinkie embarked on a stint as a boxer; first as an amateur and then as a professional. Fighting as a flyweight, he completed in over 160 bouts with limited success. On August 29, 1928, he suffered a knockout defeat to Speedy Dado which was a turning point in his tenure as a boxer. Career After marrying his wife, Elizabeth, Georgeacopoulos embarked on a promotional career in Mason City, Iowa. They relocated to Des Moines, Iowa, where George promoted his first professional wrestling match between Joe Stecher and George Vassel in 1928. On September 20, 1934, George was one of many promoters to attend the Ed Lewis–Londos bout at Wrigley Field. He managed numerous fighters such as Johnny Paychek, Glen Flanagan, Abel Cestac and Lee Savold. In 1948, he brought a National Basketball League franchise (the Waterloo Hawks) to Iowa, which proved to be unsuccessful. After losing $20,000 in under a year, he sold the franchise to his brother Andy and Charley Shipp. As a wrestling promoter, George worked closely with fellow promoters in Kansas, Nebraska, Minnesota, and Missouri. By 1950, the NWA had 26 members throughout a territory stretching from Montreal in Canada to Honolulu, Hawaii. As was planned, George stepped down as President of the NWA at the end of 1950, having taken on the role in 1948. In a further letter to Pfefer dated June 8, 1950, he stated that \\"in September, my term ends and Sam Muchnick will be elected, as I think he is the fellow deserving of it\\". George continued to run the wrestling scene in Iowa, with grapplers such as Verne Gagne, Bob Orton, Johnny Valentine and Pat O’Connor making their name in the territory. On January 23, 1951, George incorporated the NWA as a non-profit with a code of ethnics in Iowa for tax purposes, helping ensure its survival for years to come. George grew disillusioned with the direction of the NWA, which he was not reluctant in expressing, but nevertheless remained confident in the new Presidency of Muchnick. Tensions however grew and George withdrew from the NWA board of directors in 1951. With bitterness and rivalry at its height in 1957 between the NWA and rival promoters/wrestlers such as Wladek Zbyszko, George Simpson and Sonny Myers, George claimed that he received a phone call telling him to get out of the wrestling business or \\"we’ll deliver your body to your wife\\". This prompted George to purchase a gun. George alleged that this was a part of a \\"one-sided wrestling war\\" to \\"harass, scare and discourage (him) out of the business\\". He also believed it was timed to coincide with a federal investigation against the NWA for alleged monopolistic practices. The case against the NWA went to trial in December 1958. Simpson testified against Pinkie, stating he had had difficulty booking wrestlers between of the NWA system but that he had recently straightened things out with Muchnick and Brown. Muchnick himself testified as a witness for the plaintiff but did little to harm the NWA or Pinkie George. A jury found in favor of Pinkie and the NWA on December 8. Later life George was angry at what he perceived as treachery from his peers, including Muchnick. In a letter to NWA members, he resigned from the Alliance, stating that \\"a very small minority of the Alliance, including President Muchnick, are in violation of the government decree. Interlocking regional monopolies that control the champion endanger every member of the alliance\\". George would have friction with the NWA over the next several years, including an infamous federal anti-trust lawsuit. He would continue to promote boxing in the region and was an active citizen into his senior years. In 1964, he was the manager of future boxing World Welterweight Champion Curtis Cokes. Legacy Pinkie George is remembered as the visionary behind the National Wrestling Alliance and the man responsible for laying the foundations of what would become perhaps the most respected organization in the business. In 2014, he was inducted into the NWA Hall of Fame.

Its four bas-reliefs in bronze evoke central facts of the history of both countries: the Primera Junta and the Crossing of the Andes for Argentina, and the Storming of the Bastille and Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen for France. The two female figures that crown the monument symbolize Argentina and France, guided by an angel that personifies Glory. The monument also features plaques that commemorate personalities of French origin: grenadier Domingo Porteau, who died during the Battle of San Lorenzo in the Argentine War of Independence, and writer Émile Zola.

Career Born Lucy Sherrard Finley on 15 April 1817 in Sunderland, Co. Durham, she was the fourth child and eldest daughter among the ten children of Matthew Smith Finley (1778-1847), an East London schoolmaster and his wife, Mary Ann, daughter of William York, perfumer. At the end of the 1830s, she went to Russia, where for eight years she lived in St Petersburg as governess to the daughter of General Mikhail Nikolaevich Muravyev-Vilensky. In 1846 she met Thomas Witlam Atkinson, whom she married in February 1848 in Moscow. Between 1848 and 1853 she accompanied her husband on his travels through Siberia, south to the Kazakh steppes and eastwards as far as Irkutsk and the Chinese border before they returned to Britain in 1858. In his memoirs Sir Francis Galton records that on their return they were much visited by the Russian nobility at their cottage in Old Brompton Road. Soon after leaving Moscow at the beginning of her travels Lucy became pregnant, and in November 1848, at the small Russian military outpost of Kapal in what is now eastern Kazakhstan, she gave birth to a son whom she and Thomas named Alatau Tamchiboulac Atkinson. His first name, Alatau, came from the nearby Alatau Mountains and his second name Tamchiboulac (a 'dropping spring') came from the Tamshybulak Spring in Kapal famous for its healing properties. After resting for six months at Kapal, the family continued their travels, only returning to England in 1858, having journeyed for close to 40,000 miles in some of the most inhospitable landscapes in the world. On his return, Thomas wrote two books on their travels, neither of which mentioned his wife or son. This was due to the fact that he had married Lucy bigamously; his first wife Rebecca, from whom he had separated many years before he reached Russia, was still alive and living in London. In 1863, two years after Thomas' death, Lucy published Recollections of Tartar Steppes and Their Inhabitants and that year was granted a civil-list pension of £100. She received a further Civil List pension of £50 in 1870. Her book was one of the first works to concentrate on the people of the Eurasian Steppe rather than the flora and fauna. It is also one of the earliest - and finest - genuine travel books are written in English by a woman. Her book is arranged as a series of letters to a friend and shows Lucy to have been an indefatigable traveler who was held in respect by local people, both for her equestrian skills and as a markswoman with pistol and rifle. Her reference to the birth of her son Alatau, in the absence of a medical attendant, offers a further indication of her unusually independent capabilities. The book also contains descriptions of meetings with exiled survivors of the 1825 Decembrist uprising then scattered through Siberia, including M. I. Muravyev-Apostol, I. D. Yakushkin, P. I. Falkenberg, the Volkonsky and Trubetskoy families, the Borisov brothers, and the Bestuzhevs - which her husband could not include in his own books owing to the dedication of his second volume to Tsar Alexander II. Lucy's work is of interest and importance to historians of the period. During the years she spent in the home of General Muravyev, Lucy knew personally several of the family and friends of the Decembrists in St Petersburg and Moscow, as well as prominent members of the Russian aristocracy. At the end of her book, she wrote: \\"I now look back on all those scenes and repeat what we have often said, that willingly would we face ten times more toil and difficulty rather than go down to mother earth without having beheld them\\". At some point after the publication of her book, Lucy returned to Russia. She eventually came back to London, where she lived in Camden Road, Holloway. In 1881 Lucy was living in London in the home of Benjamin C. Robinson, Sergeant at Law, aged 68. Lucy is listed as a cousin to Benjamin, although in fact she was not closely related. She died of acute bronchitis at 45 Mecklenburgh Square, London, on 13 November 1893. Legacy Journalist Nick Fielding later wrote the book South to the Great Steppe: The Travels of Thomas and Lucy Atkinson in Eastern Kazakhstan, 1847–1852, which described the expedition of the Atkinson family to the Steppe.

She was best known in 1952 for her firing by Queens College for refusing to testify to the McCarran Committee whether she was a card-carrying Communist, as well as for apology and restitution she received in 1982. Background Vera Zasulich, Shlakman's namesake Vera Shlakman was born on July 15, 1909, in Montreal, Canada. Her parents, Louis Shlakman (tailor, garment foreman) and Lena Hendler, were Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. They named their children for revolutionary heroes: Vera for Vera Zasulich, Eleanora for Karl Marx's daughter Eleanor Marx, and Victor for Victor Hugo. Anarchist Emma Goldman was a family friend. In 1930, she received bachelor's degree from McGill University, followed by an MA in economics. She received a doctorate in economics at Columbia University. Her doctoral dissertation analyzed women factory workers in the 1800s in Chicopee, Massachusetts. Career The QC Quad at Queens College, where Shlakman taught Shlakman obtained a research fellowship at Smith College and then taught briefly at Sweet Briar College. In 1938, Shlakman became an instructor at Queens College, where she taught about labor, Social Security, and concentration of wealth. Shlakman was vice president of the college division of a Teachers Union local, rebuked for Communists domination. Anti-Semitism provides background to Shlakman's career as the New York City Board of Education, state officials, and courts specifically targeted left-wing Jewish teachers and professors to fire as part of their Communist purge. =Hearings, firing= Pat McCarran (1947), before whose committee Shlakman pled the First and Fifth amendments in 1952 On September 24, 1952, during testimony at a public hearing of the United States Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, led by Senator Pat McCarran, Shlakman pled the First and Fifth amendments with regard to any membership in the Communist Party. In October 1952, she was fired under two New York State regulations. The first (the Feinberg Law, authorized in 1949) barred subversive organization ties and, the other (New York City Charter Section 903) against corruption, provided that refusing testimony on official conduct, because of self-incrimination, was evidence for dismissal (by the late 1960s, both provisions were declared unconstitutional). =Later life= Shlakman's firing by Queens College \\"banished her to academic obscurity\\" at the time. She never taught Economics again at Queens College. For the rest of the 1950s, Shlakman worked as a secretary, a bookkeeper, and occasional teacher. In 1960, Dr. Shlakman started to teach again at Adelphi University's School of Social Work. In 1966, she became a full-time professor at Columbia University School of Social Work. She retired as professor emerita in 1978. Dr. Shlakman's enduring connection to Columbia's School of Social Work led her to establish a scholarship, and to leave a bequest to the School in her will. =Restitution= In 1980, City University offered an apology to professors dismissed then, including Shlakman. \\"They were dismissed during and in the spirit of the shameful era of McCarthyism, during which the freedoms traditionally associated with academic institutions were quashed,\\" the trustees of the City University of New York declared in a unanimous resolution. Shlakman and Oscar Shaftel filed an appeal to New York City Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin over pensions or death benefits for former professors dismissed during the Second Red Scare. In April 1982, the City announced a $935,098 settlement with seven living and three deceased former professors: Dr. Shlakman received $114,599. Besides Shlakman and Shaftel, the other professors were: Richard Austin, Joseph Bressler, Dudley Straus, Sarah Reidman Gustafson, and Bernard F. Riess. Personal life and death Shlakman never married. Scholar Marjorie Heins has assessed that Shlakman was a socialist-anarchist but not necessarily a communist. Shlakman believed that fears of \\"communism\\" fell prone to exaggeration. For example, \\"When the United States Post Office began to carry packages, this activity was viewed as a challenge to private enterprise ... and a kind of socialistic or communistic activity\\" but not for long. Regarding her firing, she held that the academic community had a choice not to fire her but chose to do so. She questioned: \\"Is the dismissal of teachers easier to accept than the burning of books?\\" In her last years, she became homebound due to blindness. Friends who looked after her included Ellen J. Holahan, Judith Podore Ward, and Bernard Tuchman. According to her friends, she never revealed whether she had been a Party member. Shlakman died aged 108 on November 5, 2017, at home in Manhattan. Her friend Ellen J. Holahan reported the death. Legacy Sam Roberts of The New York Times commented at her death, \\"A 42-year-old assistant professor when she was fired in 1952, Dr. Shlakman neither taught economics again nor wrote a sequel to her groundbreaking 1935 book on female factory workers.\\" In the introduction to her 2013 book Priests of Our Democracy, Marjorie Heins asks the question \\"Why did Vera Shlakman, Oscar Shaftel, and hundreds of others refuse to cooperate in the political inquisitions of the witch-hunt era?\\" She answers, \\"Many people who had made the difficult break with communism, or who had never been communists, simply did not want to collaborate in the Red hunt.\\" Works Child laborer (1911) photo by Lewis Hine, in Chicopee, Massachusetts, real-life setting for Shlakman's book Shlakman published only one major book, of which historian Alice Kessler-Harris of Columbia University later wrote: > Vera Shlakman had an extraordinary effect on my work and on that of a > generation of labor historians. Quietly, unobtrusively her interpretive > insights and the methodological innovations she introduced paved the way to > a more eclectic and integrated discipline. A full seventy years after its > publication in 1935, her Economic History of a Factory Town: A Study of > Chicopee, Massachusetts still provides an intellectual and conceptual guide, > not only to a changing field, but to the persistent questions it raises. > because her book 'raised the question of how a transformation in the meaning > of work for female workers could, and perhaps did, alter the workplace > environment and the nature of family life.' In 2017, Kessler-Harris added that Shlakman's study of Chicopee confirmed that fundamental problems between capital and labor and thus that labor protests were a reaction to capitalist excesses. In 2017, historian Joshua B. Freeman of Queens College praised Shlakman's 1935 book because it \\"extended the boundaries of American working-class history\\" and influenced a generation of historians.\\" * Economic History of a Factory Town: A Study of Chicopee, Massachusetts (1935) (1969) References External links * Photo of Shlakman with New York City Comptroller Harrison J.

One of only three third-generation families to play in the National Football League (NFL), it is often called the \\"NFL's First Family\\". Its seven members who have played in the NFL have combined for 25 Pro Bowl invitations, 11 first-team All-Pro selections, and three Super Bowl appearances. History The family patriarch, H. L. Matthews, was born in Jeffersonville, Ohio, in 1889. After serving in World War I, he held tenures as a boxing, baseball, and track coach for The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina from 1926 to 1953. H. L. Matthews' son, Clay Matthews Sr., began the family's legacy in football. After playing football in college for the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, he was drafted in the 1949 NFL Draft by the Los Angeles Rams, but never played for the team. He instead joined the San Francisco 49ers in 1950 and played offensive tackle, defensive tackle, and defensive end. His career was interrupted by the Korean War, in which he served as a paratrooper. He rejoined the 49ers in 1953 and played for three more seasons before retiring. Matthews Sr. died on March 24, 2017, aged 88. Two of Matthews Sr.'s sons played in the NFL: Clay Matthews Jr. and Bruce Matthews. Each played college football for the USC Trojans, and they were both selected in the first round of their respective drafts; Clay Jr. in 1978 and Bruce in 1983. Clay Jr. was a linebacker for the Cleveland Browns from 1978 to 1993 and Atlanta Falcons from 1994 to 1996.

He completed the science of Islamic jurisprudence with the honorable title thayyib jiddan (very satisfying), awarded by Fakih Muhammad.Hamka, Antara Fakta Dan Khayal :Tuanku Rao, 1974: pp.110-112,156-157. =Padri movement= Rao was one of the strongest Padri warlords, vigorously fighting against the Dutch East Indies colonial government in Pasaman, Kotanopan, Padang Lawas, and Padang Sidempuan areas. After the Dutch troops conquered Matur and Lubuk Sikaping in October 1832, Rao was finally surrounded. Lieutenant Bevervoorden, a commander of the Dutch forces, met Rao and persuaded him to surrender. During the meeting, Rao argued that he would go to Hajj and hand over the leadership of his government to his father-in-law, Yang Dipertuan Rao.Muhammad Radjab, Perang Paderi di Sumatera Barat (1803-1838), Balai Pusataka, 1964. pp.164-166. After the meeting, Rao withdrew and hid in the forest. But inspired by Tuanku Tambusai who had just returned from Mecca, he was encouraged to continue fighting against the Dutch. To initiate the propagation of padri movement in Batak land, Rao attacked the Dutch defense in Air Bangis with the help of Tuanku Imam Bonjol.Hadler, Jeffrey. A Historiography of Violence and the Secular State in Indonesia: Tuanku Imam Bondjol and the Uses of History. The Journal of Asian Studies, Vol. 67, No. 3 (August) 2008: 971–1010. pp.982 On January 29, 1833, Rao was intercepted by Dutch troops. His resistance was pierced after he was severely injured by bullet wounds. He was then sent by the Dutch to exile, during which he died shortly after. His body was allegedly dumped into the sea by Dutch troops. Posthumous controversy The association between the history of Tuanku Rao, padri movement and the Indonesian patriotism was briefly challenged by the so-called amateur historians who criticized the ideology of padris during the Sukarno regime era. The scrutiny was held by a Mandailing writer Mangaradja Onggang Parlindungan in his work Tuanku Rao: Hambali Islamic Terror in the Batak Lands (1816-1833). The revisionism was criticized by the prominent Indonesian Islamic intellectual Hamka in his work Tuanku Rao’ Between Fact and Fantasy, and the retired Indonesian official Rusli Amran through the vigorous references to the historical archive.Rusli Amran and the Rewriting of Minangkabau History.
