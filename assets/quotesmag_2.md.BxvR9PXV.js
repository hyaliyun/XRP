In 2012, Cardiff was nominated for a Juno Award for Roots and Traditional Album of the Year: Solo and for a Canadian Folk Music Award as Contemporary Singer of the Year. Biography=Early life Craig Cardiff performs at Maxwell's Music House in Waterloo, Ontario Craig Cardiff was born July, 1976 to Judy and Charles Cardiff. He grew up with his younger sisters Catherine, Susan and Elizabeth in Waterloo, Ontario, where both his parents were school teachers.Richard Carson, 'Craig Cardiff - CD Release' as featured in Hugh's Room, January 2011, (accessed, 27 December 2014) Music was important during his upbringing and he was motivated by his parents to play an instrument.\\"Arnprior at the Junos\\" Arnprior Chronicle-Guide 29 March 2012 His parents bought him his first guitar, a Gibson J-30, when he was 15, while one of his high school teachers, taught him the guitar during his lunch hour.Vrbanac, Bob \\"Singing it out loud\\" Waterloo Chronicle 17 December 2013 Cardiff began to perform at coffeehouses and with some bands in high school. While studying at the University of Waterloo, he performed at local pubs, open mic events, and coffeehouses. He also worked as a booking agent, organizing shows at Fed Hall, including the Guess Who. Cardiff moved to the Ottawa area from Waterloo when he was in his twenties. He lived in Wakefield for a few years before buying an old farmhouse in Arnprior, which now also serves as a home recording studio.Saxberg, Lynn \\"Craig Cardiff: Floods, fires, and a high school choir\\" Ottawa Citizen 6 March 2012 1997-2010s In September 1997, Cardiff debuted with the album Judy Garland (You're Never Home) which included Deanna Knight, Tom Murray, Danny Michel, Joel Stouffer, Paul Mathew and Catherine Cardiff.Listing of the Judy Gardland (You're Never Home) album on Bandcamp.com, (accessed 27 December 2014). It was re-released in August 2006.Listing of the Judy Garland (You're Never Home) album on allmusic.com, (accessed 27 December 2014). Cardiff released his album Goodnight (Go Home) in 2007. In 2007, View Magazine stated that while Cardiff \\"...maintains a dedicated fan base\\", he \\"...is more a secret than a household name, despite his songs revealing the craft of one of the best in the business\\". View Magazine stated in 2007 that he was \\"playing bigger rooms, touring more and receiving more critical acclaim\\" after his 11th release, Good Night (Go Home).\\"Shapiro, Shane \\"Craig Cardiff\\" View Magazine 18 October 2007 The magazine called Goodnight (Go Home) \\"arguably Cardiff's most accomplished release to date.\\" He released Floods & Fires in November 2011. The album earned a Juno Award nomination as Roots and Traditional Album of the Year: Solo, as well as a Canadian Folk Music Awards nomination as Contemporary Singer of the Year. The album was in the SoundScan Top 10 for a week, and Exclaim! magazine called it \\"a major breakthrough.\\"Schneider, Jason \\"Craig Cardiff Love Is Louder (Than All This Noise) Parts 1 & 2\\" Exclaim 18 November 2013 When Cardiff released his latest album, Love Is Louder (Than All This Noise) Part 1 & 2, in November 2013, Exclaim! magazine stated: \\"With a catalogue now well into double digits and a national fan base that is surely the envy of his singer-songwriter peers, Ottawa's Craig Cardiff has been the model of how to be a successful independent Canadian musician. However, with his new double album, Love Is Louder (Than All This Noise) Parts 1 & 2, he seems better poised than ever to break into the mainstream, having recorded with a full band for the first time.\\"Schneider, Jason \\"Craig Cardiff Explains 'Love Is Louder (Than All This Noise)'\\" Exclaim 22 November 2013 When Love Is Louder (Than All This Noise) Part 1 & 2 was released, it reached as high as No. 8 on the iTunes singer-songwriter charts and for a time was the only independent Canadian album in the Top 20.\\"Singer Craig Cardiff appeals to the lost to hang on\\" Ottawa Life Magazine 13 January 2014 Recording Cardiff has offered at least one new release almost every year, and his catalogue includes live albums, studio albums, collaborations with other artists and tributes to songwriters he admires. Over the years, he has experimented with various recording styles and distribution platforms for his albums ‚Äì one release, Mistletoe (Kissing Songs), was recorded entirely on an iPod Touch.  Upstream Fishing All The Words, He Is: Birthday Cards For Bob Dylan  On 24 May 2018, Craig Cardiff released his first tribute cover album. The project included five Bob Dylan cover songs, selected for their influence on Cardiff's own music style. Reflecting on Bob Dylan's influence, Cardiff says \\"I had the same relationship with Bob Dylan's songs that I think everyone does with a favourite artist ‚Äì I tried to crack the code about what he was writing about, while sitting in the middle of their tangle and ache and joy. All his words were perfect, and he had all of them. AND it bothered my parents ‚Äì \\"He Can't Sing!\\" they said, dismissively, the same way they did when they saw me spending money on Cokes, the Dickie Dee ice cream trucks, Mad Magazines, or heaven forbid, Cracked. Wasted money!\\" Cardiff's goal for the project was to inject his own musical style into some of the songs that influenced him the most, keeping the production and arrangement of each song simple with limited instrumentation. The cover album's single, \\"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\\", reached over a half million streams on Spotify within the first month of the album's release. The album was recorded in his home recording studio in Arnprior, ON. Love Is Louder (Than All This Noise) Part 1 & 2 On 19 November 2013, Cardiff released his first double album, Love Is Louder (Than All This Noise) Part 1 & 2\\\\. It includes boisterous group \\"sing-alongs\\", and gentle lullabies, and full live band recordings, as well as more subdued, acoustic settings. Cardiff stated that in his first work with producers Ben Leggett and Andre Wahl, they encouraged him to not repeat his previous work and to make use of his producers to push him creatively. While Cardiff was nervous, he worked with the pair to explore full live band settings, \\"loud or... hard\\" arrangements, and exploring the \\"acoustic\\" of his songs, with cello, clarinet and violin arrangements used for different songs.Roberts, Sierra \\"The Cadre Chats With: Craig Cardiff\\" The Cadre 1 November 2013 While making the album, Leggett and Wahl challenged Cardiff to step outside his \\"comfort zone\\" and record with a full band for the first time. Love Is Louder (Than All This Noise) has 21 tracks, with some songs getting both loud and gentle treatments to give the song \\"two faces,\\" explains Cardiff. Cardiff, Leggett and Wahl approached the two sides of the album in two very different ways. For Part 1, they recorded at Chalet Studios, which has previously hosted acts such as Rush and Barenaked Ladies, and Leggett and Wahl coached Cardiff through the process of recording with a backing band, very different from his solo singer-songwriter experience.Cooke, Stephen \\"Now Hear This: Cardiff gives Maritimes a sneak preview\\" The Chronicle Herald 30 October 2013 Cardiff called the live band recordings \\"very uncomfortable\\" yet very exciting\\", particularly noting his work with members of Lindi Ortega's band and piano player and singer-songwriter Mike Evin for Part 1. In Part 2, Cardiff, Leggett and Wahl revisited many of the same songs as Part 1 with strings and wind instrument arrangements. For \\"There's a song\\" and \\"Boy Inside the Boat\\", Wahl suggested an R&B; approach; while Cardiff initially did not like this treatment, in the end Cardiff called these two songs the \\"...most beautiful standout songs\\". Cardiff took on new roles for Love Is Louder (Than All This Noise) Part 1 & 2, such as arranging cello parts and, for the first time, helping with the album's production.Cooper, Claire \\"Craig Cardiff\\" BeatRoute Alberta 4 November 2013 Floods & Fires Craig Cardiff - House Concert 1 - Photography by Jeff Epp While critics called Love Is Louder (Than All This Noise) Part 1 & 2 different than anything Cardiff has released before, the team behind it is familiar. Ben Leggett (Faraway Neighbours, Ben Hermann) and Andre Wahl (Hawksley Workman, Luke Doucet) also produced Floods & Fires, the album that earned Cardiff a nomination for a 2012 Juno Award for Roots and Traditional Album of the Year: Solo and a Canadian Folk Music Award nomination as 2012 Contemporary Singer of the Year. He called the recordings a \\"phenomenal experience\\", and says he gave himself \\"...permission to explore songs\\" with \\"anything from beat boxing to full horn sections.\\"Hinks, Aaron \\"Indie artist Craig Cardiff plays the Nordic Centre\\" Grande Prairie Daily Herald Tribune 10 November 2011 For Floods & Fires, Cardiff and Leggett spent 18 months working in Cardiff's home studio in Arnprior. This was the longest period of time Cardiff spent on any of his releases, which are often recorded live or \\"off the floor\\" in the studio.\\"Juno-nominated Cardiff visiting Joe's\\" Comox Valley Record 8 November 2012 For this album, Leggett re-jigged Cardiff's home studio, co-wrote some of the material and even moved into Cardiff's house to get the job done. \\"I warned him there would be a lot of scope creep with this album because I had an idea how big I wanted it to be, and I wanted to spend a lot of time,\\" says Cardiff. \\"I didn't want to set parameters ... I wanted to feel confident that the songs are fully realized.\\" Floods & Fires represents a new approach to recording for Cardiff. \\"A lot of my albums have been done off the cuff,\\" Cardiff explains. For this album, he took the time and made accepting challenges part of the process and made sure he would not have any regrets after the process. Floods & Fires is considered an ambitious album, as it features a horn section, bowed strings, electronic instrument programming and guest performers, including a high school choir. Cardiff has explained that the title (Floods & Fires) alludes to Biblical plagues which bring both destruction and opportunity. The album's 14 tracks examine \\"love and love's leaving, celebrate parenthood and... explore the balance between heartbreak and joy.\\" Cardiff says the songs were \\"...crafted during a difficult period of my life,\\" says Cardiff. \\"When hard things happened, I kept reminding myself to choose joy instead of choosing to be afraid and closing up. That's what I kept coming back to ‚Äì fear rents the cheapest room in the house. I didn't want to live like that anymore.\\" Goodnight (Go Home) When Cardiff released his album Goodnight (Go Home) in 2007, media took notice of the fact that he wasn't selling plastic-wrapped, jewel-cased editions of the album during his tour. Instead, he asked fans to bring along USB keys to buy a digital download of the album, although he did sell \\"old-fashioned CDs\\" and jewel cases for an additional fee.Sheffield, Meghan \\"Cardiff goes green with technology\\" The Journal 9 October 2007 \\"The green focus for us is just in reducing the amount of plastic we were using in CDs,\\" says Cardiff, who offered album inserts and art to fans who purchased digital music for their USB so they would still have a physical connection to the album. The Ottawa Citizen stated that the song \\"When People Go\\" had, \\"unwittingly, become Craig Cardiff's Closing Time.\\"\\"Singing about life's last call\\" Ottawa Citizen 29 November 2007 Cardiff wrote the \\"jaunty song about death\\" with a chorus that states \\"goodnight, go home, there is nothing more to see here,\\" for his daughter, who was 17 months old at the time, to explain to her what happens to people when they die. After hearing the song, DJs at campus bars in British Columbia and Ontario asked to use it as their last song of the night. \\"I explained that I actually wrote it for my daughter for when she starts asking questions about death and funerals\\" says Cardiff. The Brant Advocate pointed out the connection between Brantford, Ontario, and the song \\"Dance Me Outside\\". The song was inspired by Cardiff's mother telling him about growing up in Brantford and about First Nations woman outside of town.Schultz, Bethany \\"The Advocate Presents: Craig Cardiff\\" The Brant Advocate 31 December 2011 \\"She was trying to hitchhike, to catch a ride back in, and couldn't,\\" explains Cardiff. \\"She ended up passing from exposure. The worst part is that it's all over ‚Ä¶ Each community has a story like that; it's difficult. So there was that story that existed, and then there was the Bruce McDonald film Dance Me Outside. I hadn't seen the film, but it just had this idea that even in hard things, still having dignity, still standing up tall, even to a very bitter, sad end. That was the idea.\\" \\"Smallest Wingless\\", which the Western Gazette has called one of Cardiff's most popular songs, was inspired by a photographer friend who worked closely with Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep, a non-profit organization that provides families of babies who are stillborn or are at risk of dying as newborns with free professional portraits with their babies.Sparacino, Bianca \\"Cardiff‚Äôs sound evokes comfort, connects to fans\\" The Gazette 27 October 2010 Cardiff's song tells the story of two parents welcoming a newborn into the world, only to be told that the child will only survive for a few hours.\\"Craig Cardiff Goes Green With New Album\\" Chart Attack 26 September 2007 \\"A lot of people share their experiences with me in regards to that,\\" Cardiff has said of the song. Craig Cardiff performs at The Albion Hotel in Guelph, Ontario. Photo by Adam M. Dee of Subtle Solace Photo & Fine Arts (@SubtleSolaceArt). From a recording standpoint, Goodnight (Go Home) is different than the 10 albums that came before it. Produced by Les Cooper (Jill Barber, Andy Stochansky), the album came together over a longer period than any of Cardiff's previous releases. \\"I think what I learned on this album is that it's good to capture everything and eavesdrop a lot and be like a bird building a nest, taking in little parts of everything ‚Äì and then to walk away from that,\\" he says. Musically, Goodnight (Go Home) features Paul Mathew (Hidden Cameras), Michael Olsen (K-os, Arcade Fire), Kieran Adams (Sarah Harmer), Rose Cousins, Joel Stouffer (Dragonette, Jason Collette) and Lisa MacIsaac (Madison Violet). Studio albums Among Cardiff's releases, his studio albums include Novemberish (Songs From The Rain), Love Is Louder (Than All This Noise) Part 1 & 2, Floods & Fires, Mothers & Daughters, Goodnight (Go Home), Auberge Blacksheep, Fistful of Flowers, Soda, Happy, Live At The Boehmer Box Company, Great American White Trash Novel and Judy Garland (You're Never Home). The album Kissing Songs (Mistletoe), which was released in 2008, was recorded entirely on an iPod Touch using the Octopod application.Seewalt, Lindsay \\"Craig Cardiff brings 'Book of Truths' to Legacy\\" Cochrane Eagle 7 November 2013 Live albums Cardiff has released a number of live albums. Songs For Lucy was recorded at the Blacksheep Inn in Wakefield, Quebec, and released in 2010. Easter Eggs, released in 2007, is a collection of live recordings from various performances. Featuring songs by Cardiff and by Toronto's Les Cooper, Bombshelter Livingroom was recorded live at the University of Waterloo Bombshelter Pub and was released in 2005. Gingers on Barrington Street, which was released in 2003, is a shared album featuring songs by Cardiff and by Rose Cousins. It was recorded at Ginger's Tavern above the Granite Brewery in downtown Halifax. Collaborations and covers Cardiff often pays tribute to his favourite songwriters in his performances and on his albums. In 2010, Cardiff released the album Mothers & Daughters, featuring 11 covers of songs written by some of his favourite female songwriters. These include Ani Difranco, Cyndi Lauper, Joni Mitchell, Gillian Welch, Patty Griffin, Sin√©ad O'Connor, Bj√∂rk, Indigo Girls and Suzanne Vega. Cardiff's album Fistful of Flowers, released in 2005, features his version of songs written by Peter Gabriel, Elvis Costello, Suzanne Vega, Martin Sexton and others. In 2018, Cardiff released a five-song album of exclusively Bob Dylan covers. \\"I'm a huge fan of other songwriters, and this album is a way to reinterpret what they've done and lend my signature,\\" Cardiff told the Queen's Journal. \\"I've had a lot of requests from listeners who've attended shows over the past few years to put out an album like this, and all of the pieces of the project just fell together.\\"\\"Confrontational Craig Cardiff returns\\" Queen's Journal 10 March 2006 \\"I'm very proud of how it ended up feeling like a cohesive show,\\" he adds. \\"And it features musicians I love playing with‚ÄîPaul Mathew on double bass, Les Cooper on Rhodes piano and guitar, Joel Stouffer on drums. It feels like a hug.\\" Cardiff has built a community of musicians, songwriters, producers and engineers with whom he works closely. Many of them have worked with him on several albums over the years. Cardiff has said that he likes collaborating with people who \\"are challenging and not comfortable with just saying yes to things.\\"Schneider, Jason \\"Craig Cardiff Man of the People\\" Exclaim! December 2013 He recorded with a band for the first time for his latest album, Love Is Louder (Than All This Noise) Part 1 & 2\\\\. Recording live off the floor with musicians James Robertson, Paul Mathew, Sly Juhas, Mike Evin and Robbie Grunwald, Cardiff found himself far outside his comfort zone, intimidated and amazed. \\"It was funny to be intimidated while making this album, to come into the sessions and think, these guys are amazing players, I'd better remember my capo position,\\" he says. \\"If there's anything I want to get better at, it's to push myself musically by creating those situations with other artists.\\" Ben Leggett and Andre Wahl Cardiff has worked closely with producer/engineer Ben Leggett of North Bay, Ontario, for a number of years, and Leggett has become more involved in the albums. Leggett produced Cardiff's albums Song for Lucy and Mothers and Daughters and provided mixing on the albums Happy, Live at the Boehmer Box Company, Easter Eggs, Bombshelter Livingroom, Fistful of Flowers and Gingers on Barrington Street. Leggett played a much bigger part in the Juno-nominated album Floods & Fires than any previous release, which he and Cardiff recorded over a span of a year and a half. \\"We really went the extra mile to get the most possible out of the songs. There is everything on this album: Piano, horns, electric guitar, drums, bass, clarinet, saxophone...,\\" says Leggett. \\"I love the album ... I am very proud of it.\\"Cramer, Brandi \\"Musician's work helps album land Juno nod\\" North Bay Nugget 1 March 2012 With Floods & Fires, Cardiff and Leggett also worked with mixer/producer/engineer Andre Wahl, who provided additional production and mixing. The trio joined forces once again for Cardiff's project 'Love Is Louder (Than All This Noise) Part 1 & 2\\\\. Together, Wahl and Leggett pushed Cardiff to make an album that didn't sound like anything he had recorded before. Leggett and Cardiff also worked together to compose the soundtrack for the independent Canadian film In Return by Chris Dymond, which was released in 2012. Les Cooper When you read the liner notes for many of Cardiff's albums, you will see the name Les Cooper. Besides producing, mixing and arranging on many albums, Cooper has also provided background vocals and played a variety of instruments on Cardiff's releases, including piano, guitar, banjo, organ, and percussion. Whether playing, mixing or producing, Cooper has been involved in the albums Goodnight (Go Home), Auberge Blacksheep, Fistful of Flowers, Gingers on Barrington Street, Soda and Bombshelter Living Room ‚Äì a shared album featuring original songs written by both Cardiff and Cooper that was recorded live at the University of Waterloo's Bombshelter Pub. Rose Cousins Cardiff has collaborated with Halifax-based singer-songwriter Rose Cousins. She has sung on a number of his albums, and they have released a live album together. Cousins met Cardiff while she was a student at Dalhousie University in Halifax. \\"I fell in love with his music,\\" she recalls. \\"He became a huge influence, he taught me a lot. In addition to being a terrific songwriter and performer, he's a great entrepreneur.\\"Reid, Rob \\"A sense of community in her music\\" Waterloo Region Record 30 April 2012 In 2003, Cardiff and Cousins released Gingers on Barrington Street, a joint live album they recorded in Halifax.

Through his website, Cardiff asked fans to suggest where he should play and then booked shows through MySpace and Facebook. Many of those venues were small and intimate, and on that tour, Cardiff booked three house concerts. Because he is going where his fans suggest he play, Cardiff asks them to help spread the word about his shows. \\"It's not unmediated. It's just more fan-directed, and that's exciting,\\" he says of what the Globe and Mail called \\"tour economics on a good-neighbour level,\\" adding: \\"I think I'll manage to avoid hotels for most of the tour because of fans and friends who are able to offer spare rooms and couches.\\" While headlining the Hay Days festival in Hay River, Northwest Territories in June 2013, Cardiff told The Hub newspaper that after touring in major centres in the United States and Canada, he now prefers going \\"off the beaten track\\" to perform.Ladik, Sarah \\"Hay Days showcases talent\\" The Hub 24 June 2013 His friendships with local people keeps Cardiff coming back to \\"alternate\\" locations that are more difficult to reach, he explains. \\"Does it make sense financially?

Trying to expand on that theme, he began playing music and telling stories in an intimate environment by performing in his fans' living rooms.Fagan, Ashley \\"Singer gives new meaning to the term 'home theatre'\\" Capital Arts Online 2005 Fans regularly reach invite him to perform in their homes.

He has also performed at the University of Western Ontario's mob vote, alongside Rick Mercer. In March 2012, Cardiff performed at Phog Lounge in Windsor, Ontario, to support MedOutreach, a program by University of Windsor and University of Western Ontario medical, dental and nursing students that took them to Tanzania to help treat patients at clinics and orphanages. Cardiff told the Windsor Star that it's not so much the causes, but the people behind the causes that interest him. \\"Those are the people who are wonderfully dangerous,\\" he says. \\"They've been bitten.\\" In March 2013, Cardiff performed a benefit concert in Thunder Bay, Ontario, to raise money for Collateral Damage Project, which is based in Thunder Bay and was founded by Scott Chisholm. The goal of Collateral Damage Project is preventing suicide by stopping stigma, creating proactive dialogue and pushing for gatekeeper training.

It was a good fit because Cardiff has been a supporter of social causes and an advocate for mental health. He encourages people to be open and share things about themselves, both good and bad. \\"We all have issues and when we start talking about it ‚Ä¶ that's the key of making everybody relax a little bit and just be open to everyone,\\" he says.Logan [ http://www.thewalleye.ca/lu-students-team-up-with-juno-nominated-artist-craig- cardiff-to-raise-funds-for-suicide-awareness-prevention/ \\"LU Students Team Up with Juno-nominated Artist, Craig Cardiff, to Raise Funds for Suicide Awareness & Prevention\\"] The Walleye 22 February 2013 Throughout his career, Cardiff has volunteered his time to support organizations such as Extend-A- Family Waterloo Region, Canuck Place, the Ottawa Regional Cancer Foundation's Maplesoft Centre for Cancer Survivorship Care, Elephant Thoughts Educational Outreach, the Oxford People Against the Landfill Alliance and many others. In 2010, he performed at the first-ever Canada Without Poverty Dig'n'it(y) Busking Event in Brantford, Ontario. Workshops For the past 12 years, Cardiff has made a point of taking the time to offer workshops at schools, camps, festivals and churches throughout North America. In the fall of 2012, he did one day-long workshop with students at Churchill Alternative School in Ottawa that impacted the entire school community. Inspired by Cardiff's song Safe Here, teachers Dana Campbell and Natalie Shorkey wanted to incorporate the messages they heard in the song about safety, community and contribution into their classrooms, and they invited Cardiff to come to their school. Leading up to Cardiff's visit, they brought their Grade 2/3 and Grade 4/5 classes together to talk about what the song meant to them and brainstorm ideas for a song of their own that would reflect many of the same ideas.Chung, Lindsay \\"Discovering the Magic of Music: Ottawa Elementary Students Write a Song about Safety, Community, and Social Justice\\" ETFO Voice 14 March 2013 Cardiff spent a day at Churchill Alternative School, and the entire school community had a chance to learn about \\"Music as Magic\\" with him and to contribute ideas to a song they wrote together that day called Love Turns I Into We. \\"I think what we saw in the students and in ourselves as well was inspiration,\\" says Campbell. \\"A few teachers came up to me and said they had never seen some of their students so engaged ... It really transformed the kids in a positive way, especially those kids that don't engage as much in what's going on.\\" Multi-aged class groups with primary and junior students came together and participated in 50-minute sessions throughout the day. \\"Each class had the opportunity to pool their ideas and add their own verses to the song, which resulted in a song that reflected the entire school's ideas of what love is,\\" explains Campbell. \\"Craig listened to and wrote down the children's ideas and helped solidify them to create Love Turns I Into We.\\" Cardiff often hosts songwriting workshops with university students, bringing people together to share their ideas.Mahoney, Tara \\"Cardiff fixes everything at Huguette Labelle Hall\\" The Fulcrum 6 March 2014 He splits workshop participants into smaller groups to create \\"a smaller, more comfortable space for sharing their own pieces,\\" giving individuals feedback in a \\"positive and enriching environment\\". Cardiff has been facilitating workshops for many years, and he sees them as another way to connect with people who love music. \\"Workshops provide the opportunity to connect with songwriters who are on campus or in the community,\\" he says. \\"It's something I've been doing to try and connect that way.\\" As Cardiff sees it, a workshop is not a one-way dialogue, but a conversation. \\"You end up performing and you kind of do your thing, but the opportunity to encourage people feels like a different piece of work,\\" he says. \\"I'm excited to meet some of these people 10, 15 years from now and see what they create.\\" In June 2011, Cardiff participated in TEDxUWO at the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario. The theme of this inaugural conference was 'Own Your Passion', and Cardiff gave a presentation called Fear is the Cheapest Room in the House in which he spoke about being open and passionate and choosing not to be afraid and also shared some of his songs that relate to those ideas. \\"The whole concept was talking about success and innovation,\\" Cardiff told the Nanaimo News Bulletin. \\"I would meet so many people during shows and tours who would confide in what they really wanted to be doing. 'I would much rather be doing this' or 'I gave up music because my parents told me it wasn't a good idea' or what have you and then they would have all these explanations as to why it wouldn't work. I just connected those ideas of understanding the importance of trying something and not making decisions that are fear-based.\\"\\"Singer strives for truth\\" Nanaimo News Bulletin 1 April 2014 Awards Cardiff was nominated for a 2012 Juno Award for Roots and Traditional Album of the Year: Solo for Floods and Fires in a category with eventual winner Bruce Cockburn, David Francey, Dave Gunning and Lindi Ortega. Floods & Fires also garnered a nomination for Cardiff as Contemporary Singer of the Year at the 2012 Canadian Folk Music Awards. Rose Cousins won the award, while Keri Latimer, Geraldine Hollett for The Once, and Catherine MacLellan were also nominated. Cardiff won the Canadian Organization of Campus Activities (COCA) Campus Entertainment Award as best singer- songwriter in both 2014 and 2013. COCA also recognized Cardiff in 2007, awarding him the Contemporary Music (Independent) Award. 2012 Juno Awards In the lead-up to the 2012 Juno Awards ceremony in Ottawa, Cardiff had the opportunity to perform his song Safe Here (from his 2011 album Foods & Fires) with former Canadian governor general Micha√´lle Jean and pianist Nick Roy at the University of Ottawa. On 26 March 2012, the trio kicked off the Juno Pianos project ‚Äì which encouraged Juno nominees and members of the public to celebrate Juno Week by playing pianos that had been placed in public spaces all around Ottawa - with this performance. Jean translated the chorus of Safe Here into French, and, after singing, she told the audience that this is a song she can relate to, as she would ask herself on several occasions \\"am I safe here?\\" when she arrived in Canada in 1968 after leaving her native country of Haiti.Dempsey, Jessica \\"Special performance in Tabaret by Craig Cardiff, Micha√´lle Jean and Nick Roy\\" Gazette 28 March 2012 \\"I ended up recording little bits of the song for her as YouTube links and then we just shared them back and forth and then when we got together she had translated them,\\" says Cardiff. \\"It was pretty sweet. She's a very lovely person and I feel lucky that that happened.\\" Book of Truths Cardiff often passes around a notebook at his shows called a \\"Book of Truths\\". Audience members are then asked to contribute to this notebook by writing something inside, \\"... a story, a confession, a hope, a secret.\\"Gray, Mackenzie \\"Craig Cardiff to host workshop and perform at Tabaret\\" The Fulcrum 24 February 2013 \\"The nature of performing is very egotistical,\\" he has said in the past. \\"There is one microphone and generally I get to have it for most of the time ‚Ä¶ the book just came from a place of wanting to give people an outlet to write down some of these stories.\\" Craig Cardiff performs at the London Music Club in London, Ontario, in November 2013. Photo by Adam M. Dee of Subtle Solace Photo & Fine Arts (@SubtleSolaceArt). The Book of Truths was born when Cardiff gave one of his notebooks to a couple and asked them to write down the story they told him about their connection with his music so that he wouldn't forget it. Over the years, a number of Cardiff's songs have been inspired by entries in his Book of Truths. The bittersweet themes running throughout his latest album, Love Is Louder (Than All This Noise) Part 1 & 2 largely stem from those stories, written anonymously by fans. \\"I feel a lot of these songs all started with getting one particular note from an audience member,\\" says Cardiff. \\"This person had written about having a terrible year and wanting to take their own life. Just hard stuff. At the end of the night, I wrote a note back to them and later posted it online. A bunch of other people responded to it, and I feel like that idea carried over ‚Äì as hard as it is to stay one more day, just don't make any big decisions tonight. Wait until tomorrow morning. That kept coming up [in my writing], being so inside of your head that it's all thinking and no feeling.\\" One song, Memo, was written as a response to a heartbreaking entry shared in the book by one woman. \\"I wanted to find the person and make sure they were okay ‚Ä¶ that they knew this was all just noise and everything would be okay...\\" says Cardiff. In 2011, Cardiff printed his first edition of the Book of Truths, which he sells through his website and at shows. Musical style and influences Cardiff has described his style as \\"folk with a dash of sing-along and storytelling.\\" Cardiff's music blends many songwriter genres, including folk, country, rock and traditional, always with an emphasis on strong lyrics that relate a story. He is known for engaging fans during performances, his wide vocal range and his ability to improvise, as well as for creating cohesive, emotional performances through his on-stage humour and storytelling. \\"A big part of what I do at my shows is improv, in terms of crowd sing-along or the book of truth project ‚Äì that's been woven into everything ‚Äì in terms of crowd readings and collecting these different pieces from the audience members,\\" Cardiff told the Rocky Mountain Outlook. \\"The songs are constantly being re-examined and re-presented in different ways.\\"Hoshkiw, Drew \\"It's all about the interaction for Craig Cardiff\\" Rocky Mountain Outlook 22 November 2012 \\"Whatever magic happens when people are opened up a bit and just being with each other is a pretty special thing, and that requires the person performing to invite that from the audience, rather than simply pushing noise to them,\\" he adds. After an intimate show at Vinyl in Guelph, Ontario, Josh Doyle remarked in The Ontarion that Cardiff's \\"call and response style of involving the audience made it less of a concert and more of a large group of friends and strangers getting together ‚Ä¶ Cardiff involved his audience to the point that they stopped being an audience ‚Ä¶ His between song antics and personable approach made it also a comedy show, as Cardiff pulled enough material out of the air to have everyone in Vinyl laughing hysterically.\\" Lynn Saxberg of the Ottawa Citizen has said that \\"his folky melodies and soft vocals are as warm and soothing as a cup of hot chocolate. Like Paul Simon, Van Morrison and John Mayer, he finds a balance between heartache and joy.\\" Cardiff's singing style has been compared to that of Nick Drake.Wagner, Vit \\"With his fans, who needs an agent?\\" Toronto Star 11 January 2007 Cardiff integrates live looping, beatboxing and other non- traditional performance techniques into his live performances. \\"A storyteller at heart, Cardiff is renowned for his acoustic guitar-playing and soft voice, as well as the ingenious use of a digital looping pedal he performs with, which he uses to layer guitar and vocal effects over top of each other,\\" Nick Roy noted in the Queen's Journal.Roy, Nick \\"'Stories are anchors in the brain's ocean that the boats of songs tether to'\\" The Journal 1 October 2010 Cardiff has a wide variety of influences, and he has listed B.B. King, Ani DiFranco and Scott Merritt among them. Elvis Costello and Paul Simon are also among his favourite musicians. \\"I tend to like somebody whose lyrics will stand up on their own without the melody,\\" says Cardiff. Film soundtracks In 2010, Cardiff and Leggett re-recorded Cardiff's song Barney and Miriam, a tribute to the Mordecai Richler novel Barney's Version that had previously been released on Ginger's on Barrington Street with Rose Cousins in 2003, during sessions for the album Floods and Fires. The song was featured on the soundtrack for the Canadian comedy-drama Barney's Version. Cardiff's work was featured in the soundtrack for an independent Canadian film that was named Audience Choice Best Feature at the Cin√©fest Sudbury International Film Festival in September 2012. Cardiff teamed up with Leggett once again to compose the soundtrack for In Return, a dark romantic comedy written and directed by Chris Dymond. The film features original compositions by Cardiff and Leggett, Cardiff's songs from Floods & Fires, and songs by Ontario bands The Famly and Faraway Neighbours.

A live medley of \\"Hollow\\" and another Pantera song, \\"Domination\\", is featured on Official Live: 101 Proof as \\"Dom/Hollow\\". Lyrics The lyrics are a reflection on a friend who has slipped into a comatose or vegetative state. Phil Anselmo says that the song was not about a specific person, but a series of losses he suffered. Song structure The song is the last on the album and starts off with a harmonized electric guitar phrasing (in 6/8), with an electric guitar with a chorus effect in the background. Phil Anselmo's voice is much softer in the beginning of this song, as opposed to the rest of the album. The vocals are very reminiscent of another hit ballad by Pantera, \\"Cemetery Gates\\". The song starts with a medium tempo and continues until the middle. Preceding a short solo by Dimebag Darrell, there is a short breakdown and the song continues with more intense heavy riffing and drumming (in 4/4) and more aggressive raspy singing and growling from Anselmo. Release and reception The song was released in 1992 as the band's third single for Vulgar Display of Power. Although the song is one of Pantera's most well known songs it failed to chart.

He has been tied to the murders of seven women. He preferred \\"street\\" women, usually addicts, sex workers, and runaways. The bodies of six of the women were found at a dump site located on privately owned forest lands outside Molalla, Oregon, and thus he was dubbed the \\"Molalla Forest Murderer\\". Crimes Rogers was convicted in 1988 for the murder of his last victim, Jennifer Lisa Smith, whom he killed on August 7, 1987, and in 1989 for a further six murders for which he was sentenced to death. Jennifer Lisa Smith was a convicted sex worker and drug addict. She was in Rogers' truck parked in a lot located off of SE McLoughlin Blvd in Oak Grove in unincorporated Clackamas County, when he stabbed her 11 times in the breasts, abdomen and back. She fell out of the truck and was attended to by witnesses from a nearby Denny's restaurant, later dying at the hospital. One witness stood by a window relaying the action to another patron who could not see the parking lot; that patron called the Clackamas County Sheriff's Office. When the victim fell to the ground, several witnesses ran to their cars in an attempt to block Rogers' car in the parking lot. However, he drove over the landscaping and headed south on SE McLoughlin. One witness followed Rogers through Milwaukie, Gladstone, Oregon City and Canby at speeds up to 100 mph. When the suspect's car pulled into a driveway, the following driver took the address, went to a phone and reported the information. Rogers' modus operandi was to pick up sex workers and take them to secluded areas. He took at least six of them into the forest where he tied them up and killed them. He was married and had a child. He was a small engine mechanic by trade and deeply in debt. He was connected to the bodies through his habit of pouring a mini-bottle of vodka into an orange juice bottle to make himself a screwdriver. Rogers was convicted in May 1989 for the murders of 23-year-old Lisa Marie Mock, 26-year-old Maureen Ann Hodges, 35-year-old Christine Lotus Adams, 20-year-old Cynthia Devore, 26-year-old Nondace \\"Noni\\" Cervantes and 16-year-old Riatha Gyles. The seventh body was identified in August 2013. Rogers was sentenced to death three times, and three times the Oregon Supreme Court vacated the sentence of death and remanded the case for a new trial. The first two Supreme Court decisions came in 1992 and 2000.State of Oregon v. Rogers, 313 Or 356, 836 P2d 1308 (1992), cert den 507 US 974 (1993)  State of Oregon v. Rogers, 330 Or 282, 4 P3d 1261 (2000) In both instances, a jury again imposed the death penalty. On October 11, 2012, the Oregon Supreme Court vacated his latest death sentence, and remanded the case for a new trial on the appropriate penalty.State of Oregon v. Rogers, __ Or __ (2012) On November 16, 2015, a Clackamas county jury sentenced Rogers to death for the fourth time. According to his defense attorney, Rogers would have waived all future appeals and allocuted to his crimes in exchange for a true life sentence instead of the death penalty.

Sg√πrr a' Bhealaich Dheirg is a Scottish mountain situated in Kintail on the northern side of Glen Shiel, 30 kilometres south east of Kyle of Lochalsh. Overview It is part of a group of three Munros (the other two being Aonach Meadhoin and S√†ileag) known as the North Glen Shiel Ridge; they are also known as the ‚ÄúBrothers of Kintail‚Äù in contrast to the Five Sisters of Kintail which lie just to the west. Sg√πrr a' Bhealaich Dheirg is the highest of the three Brothers with a height of 1036 metres (3399 feet). The mountain's name translates from Gaelic as ‚ÄúPeak of the Red Pass‚Äù but the Red Pass (Bhealaich Dheirg) is not marked on Ordnance Survey maps so its exact location is uncertain. Topography Sg√πrr a' Bhealaich Dheirg is similar to the other Munros on the northern side of Glen Shiel in that it has extremely steep grassy slopes which descend into Glen Shiel, while to the north there are craggy coires and ridges. The southern flank of the mountain descends 850 metres in two kilometres to the valley floor: this steepness deters direct ascents of the mountain from the A87 road in the glen. There are also steepy grassy slopes to the east which descend to Coire nan Eun. The mountain is made up of four ridges. The main east‚Äìwest ridge links with the adjoining Munros of S√†ileag (west) and Aonach Meadhoin (east). There are two ridges which go northerly (north and north east) from the summit plateau and descend into the isolated country of the Kintail Forest. Sg√πrr a' Bhealaich Dheirg stands on the main east‚Äìwest watershed of Scotland with drainage going to both coasts of the country. It has the distinction of having two sizable rivers rising from its northern corries. The River Croe which emerges from a small lochan called Loch a Glas Choire within the Glas Choire flows north west for 12 kilometres to join the sea at Loch Duich on the west coast. The River Affric rises in Coire nan Eun on the eastern flank of the mountain and flows some 80 kilometres to reach the east coast at the Beauly Firth. The steep southern slopes of the mountain are clothed in the trees of the Glenshiel Forest below the 450 metre contour. Ascents and summit As mentioned, the steepness of the southern slopes deter direct ascents of the mountain. It is possible to tackle the mountain from a starting point two kilometres west of the Cluanie Inn, going through the forest and ascending by a subsidiary ridge called Meall a‚Äô Charra which joins the eastern ridge at the col with Aonach Meadhoin. The majority of visitors to the summit arrive along either the east or west ridges from the adjoining ‚ÄúBrothers‚Äù Munros. This traverse of all three mountains starts either at the Cluanie Inn to the east of the group, or from a parking place in Glen Shiel at grid reference to the west. The starting and finishing point of this walk is several kilometres apart. The Summit of Sg√πrr a' Bhealaich Dheirg can come as a surprise to the walker with the highest point situated off the main summit plateau, 80 metres along the narrow north east ridge with a strange dry stone wall leading to it. It is an easy scramble to reach the well built summit cairn which commands good views of the mountainous country to the north.

In 1931 the village consisted of 115 houses. It was overrun by Israeli forces during operation Yo'av in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. Bayt Jirja was found depopulated in November 1948, during \\"clean up sweeps\\" to expel any partial inhabited villages and destroy village housing to prevent any possible re- occupation in the area.Morris, 2004, p. xix, village #312, pp. 517‚Äì518 The village was completely destroyed after the occupation and only one tomb remains. History Newspaper salesman, Bayt Jirja, 1941 Bayt Jirja contained the archaeological site of Khirbat 'Amuda, excavation there in 2005 yielded coins and pottery fragments from the Byzantine and early Islamic period.Nahshoni, 2008, Khirbat ‚ÄòAmuda Final Report Khirbat 'Amuda was known to the Crusaders as Amouhde, and pottery fragments, cisterns, and a pool have also been found there.Khalidi, 1992, p. 88 The Arab geographer Yaqut, writing in the 1220s called the village for \\"Jirja\\", and said it was the birthplace of Abu al-Fadl al-Jirja, at one time the major authority in Palestine on hadith. Ottoman era In 1517, Bayt Jirja was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire with the rest of Palestine, and in 1596 the village appeared in the Ottoman tax registers (named \\"Bayt Harja\\" (Farja)) as being in the nahiya (subdistrict) of Gaza, part of the Sanjak of Gaza, with a population of 71 households and 14 bachelors, an estimated 468 persons, all Muslims. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 33,3% on a number of crops, including wheat, barley and fruit trees, as well as on goats and beehives; a total of 18,500 ak√ße. All of the revenue went to a waqf.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 145. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 88 Sometime after this, the village must have been destroyed, as a marble slab at the entrance to the yard of the village mosque proclaimed that Abdullah Pasha of Acre, via his delegate Mohammed Shahin, had rebuilt the village in 1825-26.Sharon, 1999, pp. 143, 144 In 1838, Beit Jerja was noted as a Muslim village in the Gaza area.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, Appendix 2, p. 118 In May 1863, Victor Gu√©rin visited the village.

The villagers kept a shrine, located on the eastern edge and overlooking Wadi al- Abd, and which they believed to be the tomb of \\"prophet\\" (nabi) Jirja. An elementary school was established in the center of village in 1932, and it had 67 students in the mid-1940s. The village center also contained some small shops.

The outlines cover a wide variety of academic subjects including mathematics, engineering and the physical sciences, computer science, biology and the health sciences, accounting, finance, economics, grammar and vocabulary, and other fields. In most subject areas the full title of each outline starts with Schaum's Outline of Theory and Problems of, but on the cover this has been shortened to simply Schaum's Outlines followed by the subject name in more recent texts. Background and description The series was originally developed in the 1930s by Daniel Schaum (November 13, 1913 ‚Äì August 22, 2008), son of eastern European immigrants. McGraw-Hill purchased Schaum Publishing Company in 1967. Titles are continually revised to reflect current educational standards in their fields, including updates with new information, additional examples, use of new technology (calculators and computers), and so forth. New titles are also introduced in emerging fields such as computer graphics. Many titles feature noted authors in their respective fields, such as Murray R. Spiegel and Seymour Lipschutz. Originally designed for college-level students as a supplement to standard course textbooks, each chapter of a typical Outline begins with only a terse explanation of relevant topics, followed by many fully worked examples to illustrate common problem-solving techniques, and ends with a set of further exercises where usually only brief answers are given and not full solutions. Despite being marketed as a supplement, several titles have become widely used as primary textbooks for courses (the Discrete Mathematics and Statistics titles are examples). This is particularly true in settings where an important factor in the selection of a text is the price, such as in community colleges. Easy Outlines Condensed versions of the full Schaum's Outlines called \\"Easy Outlines\\" started to appear in the late 1990s, aimed primarily at high-school students, especially those taking AP courses. These typically feature the same explanatory material as their full- size counterparts, sometimes edited to omit advanced topics, but contain greatly reduced sets of worked examples and usually lack any supplementary exercises. As a result, they are less suited to self-study for those learning a subject for the first time, unless they are used alongside a standard textbook or other resource. They cost about half the price of the full outlines, however, and their smaller size makes them more portable. Comparison with other series Schaum's Outlines are part of the educational supplements niche of book publishing. They are a staple in the educational sections of retail bookstores, where books on subjects such as chemistry and calculus may be found. Many titles on advanced topics are also available, such as complex variables and topology, but these may be harder to find in retail stores. Schaum's Outlines are frequently seen alongside the Barron's \\"Easy Way\\" series and McGraw-Hill's own \\"Demystified\\" series. The \\"Demystified\\" series is introductory in nature, for middle and high school students, favoring more in-depth coverage of introductory material at the expense of fewer topics. The \\"Easy Way\\" series is a middle ground: more rigorous and detailed than the \\"Demystified\\" books, but not as rigorous and terse as the Schaum's series. Schaum's originally occupied the niche of college supplements, and the titles tend to be more advanced and rigorous. With the expansion of AP classes in high schools, Schaum's Outlines are positioned as AP supplements. The outline format makes explanations more terse than any other supplement. Schaum's has a much wider range of titles than any other series, including even some graduate-level titles.

The book is on its second printing in the United States.Charles Stross ‚Äì 2007-10-12 The novel was nominated for both the Hugo and Locus Awards in 2008. The main story is split between three main protagonists, Sue, Elaine, and Jack, whose sections are always in the second person, with italicised thoughts in first person during each character's respective chapter. Each chapter is followed in sequential trilogies (Sue, Elaine, Jack) for the duration of the novel. This pattern excepts only the prologue and epilogue of the novel, which both contain faux email to supporting characters. A sequel to Halting State entitled Rule 34 (previously '419') was released in mid-2011. Plot summary The plot opens with a faux email addressed to Nigel MacDonald, listing a job offer. It is later learned that this email is for a work-at-home programmer position at Hayek Associates PLC. It is then learned that a cybercrime has been committed in the massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) Avalon Four. A robbery of several thousand euros worth of \\"prestige items\\" occurs in the game's central bank, led by a band of orcs and a \\"dragon for fire support.\\" It is later noticed that this seemingly simple incident has deep implications ‚Äì both financial (Hayek stock price) and logistical (compromised cryptographic keys), which sets the stage for the latter half of the novel. The main story is then divided between police chapters as Sue, investigation sections as Elaine, and programmer and gamer geek sections as Jack. Initially separate storylines, the three inevitably join forces to combat a much larger conspiracy that hinges on international espionage and counterterrorism. These initial segments track the bank robbery and mystery man, Nigel MacDonald, who is revealed as a shadow identity created from Jack Reed's credentials as a programmer and gamer. Eventually, it is discovered that the entirety of the European network backbone‚Äîincluding its root keyservers‚Äîhas been compromised by Chinese hackers. It is more or less at this point that the wool is removed from the reader's eyes that \\"it's no longer a game,\\" while Jack and Elaine develop a romance between action segments. Using the game Spooks as a sock puppet for real espionage missions, Jack and Elaine are sent to uncover the identity of a mole inside Hayek Associates, which is subsequently revealed to be a front for the government. The mole is said to have leaked cryptographic keys to \\"Team Red\\", or Chinese interests, through a blacknet. For contrast, the European protagonists are called simply, \\"Team Blue\\". It is at this point that the stage is set for the final confrontation. Using Nigel's shadow identity as bait for Team Red's mole, Elaine and Jack successfully expose and capture Marcus Hackman, who is revealed to be the mole and main antagonist. It is then revealed that Hackman had staged the whole thing to use strategic put options to earn ‚Ç¨26 million when his own company, Hayek Associates, took the fall for the initial robbery sequence. Jack is shot twice in the chest during this exchange, but is seen recovering in a hospital bed by the end of the book. The novel closes with an email addressed to Hackman that resembles a 419 scam from a Nigerian banker, implying that is where he hid the money.

For personal heroism, he had become a prot√©g√© of prominent officials before the war and rose rapidly in the government. In 1949, he was automatically convicted as a Vichy official and sentenced to five years of Indignit√© nationale, but his sentence was reduced due to beliefs that he also aided the Resistance and attempted to preserve some autonomy for French police during the Nazi Occupation. Excluded from the government, he went into business. After receiving amnesty in 1959, Bousquet became active again in politics, supporting left-wing politicians through the 1970s, and becoming a regular visitor of Fran√ßois Mitterrand after his election as president in the 1980s. In 1989, after years of increasing accusations about his activities during the war, Bousquet was accused by three groups of crimes against humanity. He was ultimately indicted by the French Ministry of Justice in 1991 for his decisions during the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup in 1942, which led to Jewish children being deported and killed in German Nazi extermination camps in Eastern Europe. Bousquet was assassinated in 1993 by Christian Didier shortly before his trial was to begin. Early life and education Ren√© Bousquet was born to a radical socialist notary in Montauban, Tarn-et-Garonne. After law studies, he began his career as chief of the cabinet of the for Tarn-et-Garonne. Early career In March 1930, he and a friend (who died during the episode) became national heroes after they personally saved dozens of people from drowning during floods in the southwest of France. He was awarded the Legion of Honour and the (\\"Golden medal for fine deeds\\"). Maurice Sarraut, the radical-socialist senator and CEO of , and Albert Sarraut, deputy, president of the Council and minister, took on Bousquet as their prot√©g√©. Bousquet was detached to the Presidency of the Council to head the technical service in charge of the reconstruction of the flooded southern regions. He had a rapid rise within the government, gaining increasingly responsible appointments. At the age of 22, he became second of the cabinet of Pierre Cathala, then minister of the Interior. In 1933, Bousquet was promoted to sous-pr√©fet, and in 1935, he was appointed as general director of the national cabinet of the Minister for Agriculture. The next year, Bousquet was given responsibility for the central files of the National Security. In April 1938, Albert Sarraut, then Minister of the Interior, named him for Vitry-le-Fran√ßois (Marne). In 1939, he became general secretary of the for Ch√¢lons-sur-Marne (now Ch√¢lons-en-Champagne). Second World War Yellow Star of David badge in June 1942, a few weeks before the mass arrest In 1940, Bousquet was appointed as after the Armistice, in which France surrendered to Germany and agreed to occupation. In September 1941, he was appointed as the youngest regional . Because of his radical-socialist background, he was subject to the hatred of . He helped some war prisoners to escape, and worked to lighten the economic toll of the Nazi occupation on the Marne department. In 1942, Admiral Fran√ßois Darlan offered him the Ministry of Agriculture, which Bousquet twice refused. In April 1942, as the Schutzstaffel (SS) was taking over security duties in the Occupied Zone, Pierre Laval appointed Bousquet general secretary to Police. Bousquet was given permanent credentials to sign on behalf of the head of State. On 6 May or 7 May 1942, Bousquet sought and obtained consent from the SS to transfer another 5000 Jews from Drancy internment camp to the concentration camps to the east. Higher SS and Police Leader Carl Oberg was in charge of the German Police in France. Bousquet worked with him and obtained some autonomy for the French police by promising to collaborate with the Germans. Bousquet concentrated all police services under his personal authority, suppressing the branch led by Darquier de Pellepoix, general commissary of Jewish affairs. Bousquet negotiated the \\"Oberg-Bousquet\\" deal, which was presented to all regional on 8 August 1942. It formally recognised the autonomy of the French police and Gendarmerie and said that the French police would not be compelled to provide hostages, nor to hand their prisoners over to German services. But three days later, the Germans demanded the French provide 70 hostages in retaliation for the murder of eight Germans. The deportation route from Paris to Auschwitz On 2 July 1942, Bousquet and Oberg prepared the arrests known as the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup (Rafle du Vel' d'Hiv), which rounded up foreign and stateless Jews for deportation. Bousquet personally cancelled orders protecting some categories of people from arrests, notably children under 18 and parents with children under 5. After the arrests, some Catholic bishops and cardinals protested; Bousquet threatened to cancel tax privileges for Catholic schools. Under the pretext of not separating families, Prime Minister Pierre Laval ordered that Jewish children under 16 be included in deportation convoys, thus surpassing the requirements of the Nazis. Bousquet obliged and expanded the deportation to parents and their children under 2 years. In the event, children were separated from their parents and deported in different groups. Nonetheless, some scholarly sources insist that the Vichy government was unaware of the purpose of the deportation, and believed that the Jews were being taken to provide a labour force in the east. Ren√© Bousquet, in fur-trimmed coat, posing with Nazi German officials in 1943. In January 1943, Bousquet aided Carl Oberg in the organization and execution of a massive raid in Marseille, known as the Round up of Marseille. The French police assisted the German police in expelling 30,000 people from the Old Port. They subsequently destroyed the neighborhood, which the German police considered a \\"terrorist nest\\" because of its many winding, small streets. Bousquet offered his services for this operation. As the French police controlled the documentation of identity for 40,000 people. With their review assistance, the operation sent 2,000 Jewish Marseillais to the concentration camps. For this occasion, Oberg, came from Paris to supervise. He gave Bousquet orders directly received from Heinrich Himmler. It is a notable case of the French police's willing collaboration with the Nazis.Maurice Rajsfus, , Le Cherche Midi √©diteur, 1995. Chapter XIV, \\"\\", pp. 209‚Äì217 In April 1943, Bousquet met with Himmler, who declared himself \\"impressed by Bousquet's personality\\", mentioning him as a \\"precious collaborator in the framework of police collaboration\\". At the time, Bousquet was also councillor to Pierre Laval, along with and Charles Rochat. Bousquet was controversial and became resented by his fellow collaborationists and competitors for power, such as Joseph Barth√©l√©my, minister of Justice. On 2 December 1943, men of the Milice, the French collaborationist paramilitary organisation, assassinated Maurice Sarraut. Bousquet was set to arrest the attackers, and the Milice asked Berlin to get Bousquet removed. After ordering releases and destroying his archives, Bousquet resigned on 31 December 1943. He was replaced by Joseph Darnand, head of the Milice. Put in the reserve of the civil corps, Bousquet was under surveillance for nearly two weeks in a villa in Neuilly-sur-Seine. He drove to Germany in a car lent by Carl Oberg. During early 1944, the collaborationist press, such as Je suis partout, attacked Bousquet, accusing him of having served in the Vichy administration only to favour the Resistance.\\"Mr Bousquet, ex-general secretary for the Police, is at Fresnes. It had to be so. Of course, it had to be so. But it should have begun by being so. But... Mr Bousquet (from the Sarraut gang) was the prot√©g√© of hard-line republicans and in spite of being the main responsible for the Maquis, he resigned his functions under congratulations of the outmost indecency\\" ‚Äî , 21 April 1944 His cabinet director, , was reported to have also helped some Resistance networks. Bousquet was in Bavaria at the time of the German surrender. He returned to France with the status of a \\"deported person\\". He met with Laval to help him prepare for his trial. Convicted of collaboration, Laval was sentenced to death. Bousquet spent part of the night with Laval before the execution. Post-war Bousquet at his trial in June 1948 In 1949 Bousquet was the last Frenchman to be tried by the created on 18 November 1944. He was acquitted of the charge of \\"compromising the interests of the National defence\\", but was automatically declared guilty of for his involvement in the Vichy government. He was given the minimum sentence of five years on d√©gradation nationale, a measure immediately lifted for \\"having actively and sustainably participated in the Resistance against the occupier\\". As with other Vichy officials, Bousquet was excluded from the French public service. He made a career at the Banque de l'Indochine and in newspapers. He met with Fran√ßois Mitterrand through Jean-Paul Martin, Bousquet's former collaborator in Vichy. At the time, Martin was minister of over-sea territories and director of Mitterrand's cabinet.Jean-Paul Martin had rendered important services to the French Resistance, notably saving Fran√ßois Mitterrand from arrest by the Gestapo at the end of 1943. Unlike Jean Leguay and Bousquet, Jean-Paul Martin was never accused by French Justice nor by families of deported people. (, pp. 160‚Äì161) In 1957, the Conseil d'√âtat returned Bousquet's Legion of Honour to him, and he was granted amnesty on 17 January 1958. Renewal of political career In the legislative elections of 1958, Bousquet ran as a candidate for the 3rd circonscription of the Marne. He was supported by the Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance; his second was Hector Bouilly, a radical-socialist general councillor. Bousquet earned less than 10% of the votes. After Jean Baylet's death in 1959, Bousquet was appointed to the Council of administration of the newspaper . He supported the candidacy of Mitterrand in 1965, and observed an anti-Gaullist editorial line. After Bousquet quit in 1971, the tone of the newspaper softened. In 1974, Bousquet supported and helped finance Mitterrand in the presidential contest against Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing.Mitterrand later said that Bousquet was financing all the most prominent left-wing politicians from the 1950s to the 1970s, including Pierre Mend√®s France Bousquet was acquainted with numerous other political and cultural figures, such as Antoine Pinay, Bernard Cornut-Gentille, Jacques Chaban-Delmas, Edgar Faure and Maurice Faure. He was part of the administration council of UTA. After Mitterrand's election in the presidential election in 1981, Bousquet occasionally met him at the √âlys√©e to \\"talk about politics\\". In 1986, Mitterrand distanced himself from Bousquet, when opposition groups accused Bousquet of crimes against humanity during World War II. Mitterrand said he had ended this relationship after Bousquet, but only after the latter was charged with crimes against humanity for organising mass deportations of Jews. The parquet g√©n√©ral de Paris closed Bousquet's case by sending it to a court which no longer existed. This stirred outrage. Trial and murder Serge and Beate Klarsfeld visiting Jerusalem In 1989, Serge Klarsfeld and his Association des fils et filles des d√©port√©s juifs de France (Sons and daughters of Jewish Deportees from France), the and the filed a complaint against Bousquet for crimes against humanity, for the deportation of 194 children from six departments of the south of France. After eight years of investigation and numerous delay tactics, Bousquet was indicted by the national government in 1991. By 1995, only four senior French Vichy officials had been indicted for war crimes, and as of that time, only Paul Touvier had stood trial. The former Vichy official Maurice Papon was convicted of war crimes in 1998. On 8 June 1993, a few weeks before his trial was scheduled to open, Bousquet was shot dead at his apartment at 34 Avenue Rapha√´l in Paris by the 51-year-old Christian Didier who, accused of murder, pleaded not guilty, as he claimed the killing was justified by Bousquet's wartime crimes.MARY DEJEVSKY, \\"Killer's tale stirs ghosts of Vichy\\", The Independent (UK), 7 November 1995, 28 May 2012 With a history of pursuing former Vichy officials, Didier held a press conference to announce his killing of a \\"monster\\". He was defended by and Arnaud Montebourg. Didier was ruled sane although the court heard testimony about his mental problems; he was convicted and sentenced to ten years in prison.Gary Borg, \\"Writer Sentenced In Vichy Slaying\\", Chicago Tribune, 14 November 1995, accessed 28 May 2012 Had the trial against Bousquet proceeded, it would have been the first against a French citizen for crimes against humanity, in fact \\"it would have been the trial of the Vichy regime\\", according to The Independent.

The pointed fruit is purple-tinged when young and has an awn up to 10 centimeters long which is twisted and bent twice. The shape of the seed helps it self-bury. Uses This grass is the preferred material used by the California Indian basket weavers for teaching the art of basket weaving. State grass Purple needlegrass became the California state grass in 2004. It is considered a symbol of the state because it is viewed by some as one of the most widespread native California grasses, it supported Native American groups as well as Mexican ranchers, and it helps suppress invasive plant species and support native oaks.

Campus There are a number of branch campuses throughout the area, in Andover, Council Grove, Marion, McConnell, Rose Hill, and a number of distance-learning sites in high schools. Academics Butler is the second largest community college in Kansas, with 13,000 students annually across six campus location. Most are commuters. The school is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission, the Accreditation Council of Business Schools and Programs, the National League of Nursing, and the Kansas State Board of Nursing. History In 1927, El Dorado Junior College was founded. The college name has evolved over the years: Butler County Junior College, Butler County Community Junior College, Butler County Community College (BCCC), then finally to its current name of Butler Community College. The college briefly came into the national spotlight in the late 2000s when one of its students was murdered. Jackie Vietti was school president from 1995 until her retirement in December 2012. In August 2013, Kimberly Krull became president of the college.  College leaders  During the first 40 years of the college, Butler's leaders were known as the dean. That changed in 1963 when Edwin Walbourn when the school became a community college. ;Deans * Earl Walker, 1927‚Äì1946 * Hubert A.

Butler has won 10 NJCAA national championships, including six in football (1981, 1998, 1999, 2003, 2007, and 2008). Butler also has won national titles in men's basketball (1953), men's cross country (1970, 1995), women's cross country (2002), and softball (2016). Butler Softball has currently won 88 consecutive games, dating back to March 3, 2016 when the Grizzlies beat Barton Community College 9-1. This includes the 2016 NJCAA Div. I National Championship. The softball team finished third nationally in 2013 after being ranked No. 1 nationally for much of the season. That team won a program-record 54 games (54-4). The Grizzlies finished third in the 2008 NATYCAA standings, which award points to each sports team based on their finish at national competition. It is Butler's highest finish in the NATYCAA standings. Women's soccer has been among the final four twice as they reached the national semifinals in 2013 and 2015 and has been to the national tournament in Melbourne, Fla. six straight years (2011-2016). The baseball team finished third in the 1994 NJCAA Division I World Series in Grand Junction, Colo. The women's basketball team was selected as an at-large team for the 2014 NJCAA Division I national tournament held in Salina. The Grizzlies won two games and reached round of eight before being beaten by Chipola (Fla.). The Grizzlies were 34-3 that season, a school-record for wins. Troy Morrell was the head football coach from 2000-2014. He compiled a record of 154-22 in 15 seasons and won three national titles (2003, 2007, 2008) in that span. Morrell has since been inducted into the NJCAA Hall of Fame as well as the Kansas Sports Hall of Fame. Former Defensive Coordinator, Tim Schaffner was named head coach in 2015 after Morrell's resignation and led the team to the 2015 Jayhawk Conference championship.

Preparata is a computer scientist, the An Wang Professor, Emeritus, of Computer Science at Brown University. He is best known for his 1985 book \\"Computational Geometry: An Introduction\\" into which he blended salient parts of M. I. Shamos' doctoral thesis (Shamos appears as a co-author of the book). This book, which represents a snapshot of the disciplines as of 1985, has been for many years the standard textbook in the field, and has been translated into four foreign Languages (Russian, Japanese, Chinese, and Polish). He has made several contributions to the computational geometry, the most recent being the notion of \\"algorithmic degree\\" as a key feature to control robust implementations of geometric algorithms. In addition, Preparata has worked in many other areas of, or closely related to, computer science. His initial work was in coding theory, where he (independently and simultaneously) contributed the Berlekamp-Preparata codes (optimal convolution codes for burst-error correction) and the Preparata codes, the first known systematic class of nonlinear binary codes, with higher information content than corresponding linear BCH codes of the same length. Thirty years later these codes have been found relevant to quantum coding theory. In 1967, he substantially contributed to a model of system-level fault diagnosis, known today as the PMC (Preparata- Metze-Chien) model, which is a main issue in the design of highly dependable processing systems. This model is still the object of intense research today (as attested by the literature). Over the years, he was also active in research in parallel computation and VLSI theory. His 1979 paper (with Jean Vuillemin), still highly cited, presented the cube-connected-cycles (CCC), a parallel architecture that optimally emulates the hypercube interconnection. This interconnection was closely reflected in the architecture of the CM2 of Thinking Machines Inc., the first massive-parallel system in the VLSI era. His 1991 paper with Zhou and Kang on interconnection delays in VLSI was awarded the 1993 \\"Darlington Best Paper Award\\" by the IEEE Circuits and Systems Society. In the late nineties, (in joint work with G. Bilardi) he confronted the problem of the physical limitations (space and speed) of parallel computation, and formulated the conclusion that mesh connections are ultimately the only scalable massively parallel architectures. More recently the focus of his research has been Computational Biology. Among other results, he contributed (with Eli Upfal) a novel approach to DNA Sequencing by Hybridization, achieving sequencing lengths that are the square of what was previously known, which has attracted media coverage. The unifying character of these results in diverse research areas is the methodological approach, based on the construction of precise mathematical models and the use of sophisticated mathematical techniques. Preparata was born in Italy in December, 1935. He received a doctorate from the University of Rome, Italy in 1959. After a postdoctorate at CNR and several years of working in industry, he joined the faculty of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1965, where he achieved the rank of Professor in 1970. He stayed at the UIUC for many years, advising 16 Ph.D. students there. He received his Italian Libera Docenza in 1969. In 1991, Preparata moved from Illinois to Brown University where he has remained active in research, teaching, and student advising until his retirement at the end of 2013. He is the author (or co- author) of three books and nearly 250 articles. In 1997, the University of Padova awarded Preparata an honorary doctorate in Information Engineering. Preparata is an IEEE Fellow (1978),an ACM Fellow (1993), and was a Fellow of the Japan Society for the Advancement of Science.  Selected bibliography  Franco P. Preparata, Raymond T.

The transmitter for KMCN is co-located with the transmitter of sister AM station KCLN in northern Clinton. In addition to the music format, KMCN broadcasts selected local Clinton area programming, mainly remote broadcasts of occasional special broadcasts of community events. History=Early history (1970 to 1998) The current KMCN-FM went on-the-air as KCLN-FM 97.7 on December 7, 1970. The station used its KCLN-AM programming to simulcast broadcasts in the early 1970's as many AM radio stations did in back during that period. From 1976 to 1978, the station experimented and flipped its format to a hybrid of Top 40 with live disc jockeys mostly independent of its sister station. Under the watchful eye of P.D. Bill \\"The Wildman\\" Warner, the station's moniker became \\"Rock 98\\", playing a blend of Top 40, Album Rock, Disco, Adult Contemporary as well as some Oldies. On-Air Personalities at that time were: The Wildman, Fran Scheiden, Joel Craig, Mark Cooper, Bryan Bradford, Eugene Jeffreys, Mary Witt, Kim Long and Kelly Long. After that short experimental period, the station changed call letters and went to a \\"reel-to-reel\\" automated Top 40 format as KLNQ-FM in June 1978. Then the station reorganized and call letters were changed to KNJY-FM and became an Automated Adult Contemporary station on July 1, 1980. KNJY once more changed its call sign to back to KCLN-FM on June 15, 1987. Throughout those early years, the station aired country music, beautiful music, middle-of-the-road music, Top 40 music as \\"Rock 98\\" and Adult Contemporary music formats. The station eventually switched frequencies to 94.7 FM on August 8, 1998, and at the same time adopted the call letters KZEG- FM. The current KMCN-FM call sign was adopted on November 2, 2005. The Eagle 94.7 (1998 to 2005) KZEG broadcast a country music format from 1998 to 2005, and was known as The Eagle 94.7. In November 2005, both KZEG and Muscatine-based sister station KWCC were owned by WPW Broadcasting, which later became Prairie Radio Communications. The New MaC FM-93.1 and 94.7 (2005 to present) The switch from country music to adult hits on both stations happened in November 2005, with the format branded as \\"93.1 and 94.7 Mac FM\\" KZEG changed its call letters to KMCN, for \\"Mac North\\", while KWCC changed its call letters to KMCS, for \\"Mac South\\". The stations target, as well as their home cities, the \\"Quad Cities\\" market along the Iowa-Illinois border. The music mix, meanwhile generally included pop, rock and soul from the early 1970s to the present day. George Lowe is the radio voice for Mac FM. On January 14, 2013, KMCS dropped from the simulcast and flipped to \\"Vintage Sound 93.1\\", airing classic album rock. KMCN continues on with the \\"Mac FM\\" format. The station also had a competitor of sorts with KQCJ, which had aired an adult hits format as \\"Jack FM\\", but has since flipped to alternative rock as Planet 93.9.

It is one of the first bhakti prayers in this school of thought and is the basis for many prayers, like Raghuveera gadyam of this style. It is recited in the 108 divya desam temples including Srirangam. Context Ramanuja and his disciples visited the Ranganatha temple in Shrirangam on panguni uttiram, a day in the tamil calendar month of panguni (in spring) on the day of the ascension of the star called Uttiram. In Tamil mythology, Uttiram was in ascent when the goddess of the temple, Sri Ranganayaki Tayar, Lakshmi, was born and also the day she wed the god, Ranganatha. Ramanuja was inspired by the festivities of the day and composed Sriranga Gadyam and Sharanagati Gadyam and Vaikuntha Gadyam. Content Sharanagati Gadyam, unlike the commentaries of Ramanuja on Vedanta, does not have detailed philosophical debates. Instead, it is a pure expression of bhakti and describes transcendental conversation between Ramanuja and Narayana with Sri also known as Lakshmi. He first describes the limitless kindness of Sri and asks that she recommend him to Narayana. Then, after her approval, he approaches Narayana and describes Him like in the Sriranga Gadyam. He explains that he has committed many sins and is ignorant of philosophy and asks that he be accepted into the list of devotees of Narayana. He only asks that he be blessed so he becomes a supreme devotee, never forgetting to serve Narayana. Pleased by his humility and his total surrender, Shri and Narayana bless him that his single act of surrender wiped his Karma and give him Moksha.

The differences are caused by a parallax scan. When properly balanced (tuned) and displayed, the discrete parallax differences are perceived by the brain as depth. A continuously moving parallax scan records a pattern of sequential parallax views on a single strip of film or video tape. The lens's optical axis sweeps in the plane of the nominal X and Y axes around the nominal optical Z axis, pivoting on the optical convergence point (out along the Z axis), so that it passes through positions having parallax in relation to the optical convergence point. The circular scanning of the lens's optical axis traces out a coaxial cone pattern with the convergence point as its apex. Early tests revealed that the brain will translate parallax scanned information into depth information at scanning frequencies of between 3‚Äì6 Hz, and that the ideal frequency is 4.31 Hz.  Human Visual Perception  In his 1995 book, Foundations of Vision, Brian Wandell states, \\"Perception is an interpretation of the retinal image, not a description. Information in the retinal image may be interpreted in many different ways. Because we begin with ambiguous information, we cannot make deductions from the retinal image, only inferences. ....we have learned that the visual system succeeds in interpreting images because of statistical regularities present in the visual environment and hence in the retinal image. These regularities permit the visual system to use fragmentary information present in the retinal image to draw accurate inferences about the physical cause of the image. For example, when we make inferences from the retinal image, the knowledge that we live in a three-dimensional world is essential to the correct interpretation of the image. Often, we are made aware of the existence of these powerful interpretations and their assumptions when they are in error, that is, when we discover a visual illusion.\\" While it is not possible to create a stereo image on a standard display without special equipment, it is possible to create an image with enhanced texture and depth. The parallax scanning lens technology creates autostereoscopic moving images with enhanced texture and depth on standard displays (television, movie screens and computer monitors) without the necessity of special screens or the use of viewing glasses. Images can be recorded on normal film or videotape using industry standard camera systems. The image depth enhancement is accomplished entirely by the lens using parallax scanning technology.  Psycho-physical Research  It is known that the act of visual perception is a cognitive exercise and not merely a stimulus response. In other words, perception is a learned ability which we develop in infancy. Kenneth Ogle of the Mayo Clinic, reported 1967 that left and right-eye information can be presented alternatively to the left and right eyes, resulting in depth perception as long as the time interval does not exceed 100 ms. Visual researcher David Marr has suggested that perceptual fusion of binocular information occurs in a short-term memory buffer by means of some sort of visual depth mapping. In 1984, Edwin Jones of the University of South Carolina reported that the human brain can accept and process parallax information without regard to the direction of the parallax, i.e. horizontal, diagonal or vertical. A. P. McLaurin of the University of South Carolina, has stated that if visual information is in fact compared in a temporary memory and does not have to be received simultaneously, there is no reason why stereoscopic information that is appropriately sequenced at the proper rate cannot be observed by the single eye. In August 1998, the University of Virginia‚ÄîCognitive Science Department received an Innovation Award from the Virginia Center for Innovative Technology (CIT) to fund a research project to study the perceptual aspects of parallax scanning on the human visual system. This project and its subsequent report were completed in March 1999. The UVA report titled Perceived depth is enhanced with parallax scanning, was the first independent study of the parallax scanning technologies. Dr. Dennis Proffitt and Tom Banton's work confirm that parallax scanning enhances perceived depth in images, especially when the object depth is large (See UVA Report). The more depth in the scene, the more parallax scanning enhances its perception by a viewer on a standard television screen without the aid of special glasses.

They replaced the earlier ankle boots that had been in service since the early 1800s. The term \\"Ammunition boots\\" comes from the boots' unusual source. They were procured by the Master Gunner and the Munitions Board at Woolwich (the Regiment of Artillery's headquarters) rather than Horse Guards (the headquarters of the British Army). They were usually produced at a factory on site, but civilian manufacturers were given contracts to produce them during times of increased demand. Ammunition boots were unlined ankle- boots with leather laces, iron heel-plate and toe-plate, and an iron-studded leather sole. The vamp (front) and quarters (sides) were often made of a contrasting type of leather than the toe case (toe cap) and counter (heel cap), one made of \\"pebble-grained\\" (dimpled) leather and the other of smooth leather. They were designed to be hard-wearing and long-lasting rather than comfortable. The hobnail-studded soles made a loud crunching sound when the wearer was marching, earning them the nickname \\"crunchies\\". Soldiers were issued two pairs of boots, both made with a brown finish that had to be polished black. There was a brief period (1908 to 1914) where they were issued one pair that was hand-polished in black for parade and drill and one pair finished in raw brown hide for fatigue duty and field service. World War I forced the reversion to brown leather boots for Other Ranks but polished black boots were still worn by some individuals or units out of habit. Officers, who purchased their own uniforms, were still required to wear polished brown boots and matching leather Sam Browne belt with their field service uniform, marking them apart from their men. Officers' boots had heel plates, but lacked the sole studs and toe plates because they could afford to have the soles replaced. The later Boots, General Service adopted in 1927 were issued from the factory in black leather.  Patterns  Royal Bermuda Regiment soldiers in No.3 dress and ammunition boots. The original Pattern 1037 was made from 1887 to 1907. During the Second Boer War (1899-1902), civilian manufacturers made a series of variants on the Pattern 1037 due to differing manufacturing techniques (like machine-sewn uppers or glued-on outer soles). An improved 1037i pattern was adopted from 1907 to 1911. It was temporarily replaced by the similar 7325 and 7326 patterns from 1911 to 1914 while they did research for a replacement boot. The experimental \\"A\\" and \\"HN\\" series were also made during this time but were obsolete by the dawn of World War I. By 1915, the \\"B\\" series was begun, consisting chiefly of the \\"B2\\" and \\"B5\\". It was a pattern of ammunition boot with woven cotton laces, a plain-leather counter, and lacked the leather toe cap. It was created to save leather and increase production. To reinforce the boot and increase wear the B2 series had a horizontal seam between the parts of the upper and the \\"B5\\" series had rivets between the vamp and quarters. In 1918, the post-war 9902 pattern came into service. It had a \\"clump sole\\" (one-piece sole and heel), smooth leather vamp and quarters, and pebbled-leather counter and toe-cap. It came in brown leather, but was polished black. In 1924, the Pattern 4055 boot, forerunner of the Boot, General Service (BGS) was issued. It came in brown leather and had 25 hobnails. In 1927, the later Pattern 10085 boot, the BGS, was similar except it came in black leather. Variant Patterns Vehicle drivers wore boots without hobnails because they would damage the pedals and create sparks. This was extended to armored vehicle crews in the Royal Tank Regiment and Reconnaissance Corps in 1942, as well as to the crews of waterborne craft of the Royal Army Service Corps in 1943.http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/30101014 Specialists and ammo storesmen were issued regular ammo boots with rubber heels and rubber crepe soles that lacked the hobnails and steel heel- and toe-plates. This was to avoid creating sparks near flammable or explosive stores (like gunpowder or gasoline). Commandos were issued them to make it easier for them to move silently. During World War II, a pattern without the toecap was used by the Canadian Army and was issued to the Royal Air Force and the Royal Marines. As an economy measure the number of hobnails were reduced in April, 1942 to 15 hobnails, later reduced to 13 hobnails in September, 1942. The boots were the focus of much drill and attention. Achieving a high polish was often the aim and required hours of \\"bulling\\" (vigorous polishing) until it achieved a deep sheen. Experienced soldiers would \\"burn-down\\" the dimpled surface of the boots with beeswax and a heated spoon to make them smooth and easier to shine. Ammo boots were replaced by directly moulded sole boots (DMS boots) in 1958. These were identical to ammo boots save for having a rubber sole and heel. Guards Regiments however still wear the highly polished Ammunition Boots on parade.

In 1936, the Works Progress Administration (W.P.A.), part of Roosevelt's \\"New Deal\\" program, had spent over $55,000 in its work on \\"The Glen\\". It included lodges which were used for open air classes and meetings, a council ring for ceremonies, and an amphitheater. The original Lida Lee Tall building was renamed Van Bokkelen Hall in 1960, after the man and Episcopal priest, Libertus Van Bokkelen, who was authorized by the new third Maryland Constitution of 1864 and first served as Maryland State Superintendent of Public Instruction, in 1865, heading the developing, supervision and advising of public school systems for the various counties and funded the new Maryland State Normal School (M.S.N.S.). After the school was moved to Towson in 1914-1915, Richmond became the first principal to live in the white, colonial style house \\"Glen Esk\\" (now near Prettyman Hall). This was the residence of one of the estates existing on the land facing York Road, south of old Towsontown that was secured for the school. However, in 1970, President James Fisher became the last to live in the \\"Glen Esk\\" house since the school moved to Towson. Because it was no longer suitable for a family, as students were occasionally found passed out on the lawn, it was eventually turned into the Counseling Center. In 1971, as Earle T. Hawkins, former president of Towson State University, researched the school's history, he became especially interested in the meaning of the name of the house, \\"Glen Esk\\", now the counseling center. Hawkins published an article in The Baltimore Sun, in which he suggested he was trying to solve this mystery. In response, he received a letter from the wine and spirits importers Maynard and Child, Inc. of Scotland, who included a label from their brand of whiskey called \\"Glen Esk.\\" The Cook Library occupies space that was once a gymnasium. Prior to its opening, the current Media Center served as the Library. George LaTour Smith, (whom Smith Hall is named after), died on his way home after getting hit by a locomotive. The administration felt that it was respectful to name the building in his honor. Notable people *J.

Biography Klaus Havenstein grew up in Hamburg, where he started an apprenticeship as a retail salesman in 1937. At the same time, against his father's wishes, he took acting lessons from a private teacher. In 1939 Havenstein served in the 1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler where he joined the artillery. He took part in the Battle of France, in the occupation of Greece and in the war against Russia. In 1945 he was captured and was held by the U.S. Army as a prisoner of war. The Americans recognised his talent and brought him to a special camp in Garmisch-Partenkirchen to entertain imprisoned officers. There, he was discovered as a theatre actor, and it was in the Garmisch theatre that he first appeared on stage, promoted by the famous German actor Hans S√∂hnker among others. In the 1950s and 1960s Havenstein was known all over Germany. Along with Ursula Herking, Dieter Hildebrandt and Oliver Hassencamp, the cabaret artist created a form of sharp-tongued, provocative entertainment of a kind never seen before. In 1956 he was among the founders of the ensemble M√ºnchner Lach- und Schie√ügesellschaft, literally \\"Munich laughter and shooting club\\" - a mixed-up version of Wach- und Schlie√ügesellschaft (\\"security company\\"). In 1972 Havenstein left the group but remained active on television and radio. Havenstein married in 1958; his wife's name was Marina. In 1968 Havenstein played the voice of King Louie in the dubbed German version of the Walt Disney film The Jungle Book. He dubbed all the spoken and sung parts. Other voices he dubbed included those of Michel Galabru (Le Gendarme de St. Tropez), Gene Wilder (Frankenstein Junior, the German version of Young Frankenstein), Jack Lemmon (Mister Roberts), Alberto Sordi (Vitelloni) and Peter Ustinov. Havenstein also presented popular children's television programmes such as \\"Sport-Spiel-Spannung\\" (\\"sports, games, fun\\") and \\"Zwei aus einer Klasse\\" (\\"two from one school class\\"). He acted in films and began to work with the Bavarian broadcasting company Bayerischer Rundfunk. This work lasted a long time: he made around 3,000 programmes over 46 years. One of the highlights of this work was his co- production of the children's series \\"Jeremias Schrumpelhut\\", in which he spoke all 50 roles himself. In 1996 he stopped working as a radio presenter to make way for younger blood. From 1990 to 1992 Havenstein directed the festival in Bad Vilbel. Later, he took on guest roles in various television programmes such as Rudis Tagesshow with Rudi Carrell, where he entertained the crowd along with Diether Krebs and Beatrice Richter. Klaus Havenstein died in the spring of 1998 of a heart condition and was buried in the Nordfriedhof cemetery in Munich.

LSTA is a United States federal library grant program. Its roots come from the Library Services Act that was first enacted in 1956. LSTA replaced the Library Services and Construction Act (LSCA) that was first enacted in 1962. The new act was developed by the American Library Association (ALA) and other library groups.Flagg, Gordon. \\"News Fronts Washington.\\" American Libraries, December 1995. Many changes occurred with the passage of LSTA. The original act, Library Services and Construction Act (LSCA), allocated funds for construction of buildings, but LSTA has an emphasis on technology. The new priority is the creation of technological infrastructure.Gregory, Gwen. \\"The Library Services and Technology Act: How Changes from LSCA are Affecting Libraries.\\" Public Libraries, Vol. 38, no. 6, 1999: p. 378-82. Another change that occurred with the passage of LSCA was the responsibility of library services. This responsibility was originally a part of the Department of Education. It was moved to the newly created, independent federal agency called the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). The range of libraries served also changed with the enactment of LSTA. Originally, public libraries were primarily served by LSCA. With the passage of LSTA, all types of libraries are served, including public, school, academic, and special. Not all initiatives under LSCA have changed with the enactment of LSTA. Priorities, like services to the under-served and rural areas, are still supported. LSCA is a federally funded state-based program generally administered by the state library of each state. Specific funding categories are set by each state based on a long-range plan filed with the IMLS.

Plot Antonio Badalamenti, a Sicilian who has been settled for many years in Northern Italy and is employed in a car factory in Milan, takes a vacation with his family, leaving behind the modern conveniences of his home in northern Italy, to visit his childhood village in Sicily and introduce his blond, northern-Italian wife, Marta, to his mother, father and other relatives back home. While his wife suffers in the comparatively rustic conditions of her husband's hometown and has trouble adapting to the culture of Sicily, Antonio becomes reacquainted with his childhood friends. He also pays a visit to the local don, Don Vincenzo, who is a crime boss. The don smooths over some problems Antonio had with a deal to buy some property on the island, and in return, Antonio is tasked with carrying out a hit for the mob. As an outsider with no strings attached and a crack shot, Antonio is seen as a perfect candidate. While his wife is sleeping one night, Antonio leaves for what is purportedly a hunting trip with his friends. In reality, he is put inside a wooden crate and smuggled aboard an airplane into the United States, where he goes to New York City to carry out his task. The job done, he is returned to Sicily in the same manner and arrives back at home as if from the hunting trip. Plagued by what he has done, he goes back to his efficient job at the car factory.

Historically, Wanjiku was one of the nine daughters of the man and wife who founded the Agikuyu people, Gikuyu and Mumbi. Consequently, the descendants of her lineage form the Agaciku Clan of the Agikuyu tribe in Kenya. In Kikuyu traditions, the name Gathigia was also the same as Wanjiku. For instance; this happened in cases where the person after whom a child was to be named bears the same name and it existed earlier like if the mother of the husband is called Wanjiku and wife's mother is Wanjiku. The first daughter will be named Wanjiku after her fathers mother according to the naming tradition. The second daughter would also be named Wanjiku after her mothers mother, according to the naming tradition, but since it is inconvenient to have two daughters with the same name, the second daughter bore the name Gathigia just for distinction. The true name of the daughter Gathigia may be believed to be Wanjiku, so when she had granddaughters which are supposed to be named after her they may be named Wanjiku rather than Gathigia. However, this trend has changed with time and Gathigia is no longer a common name. Ciku is a common short form of Wanjiku. Today, in Kenya, Wanjiku is a name that is used to symbolize a citizen in the context of national politics. The name came to represent the ordinary person \\"Mwananchi\\" after former President Daniel arap Moi dismissed the calls for a new constitution.

Ramanuja, one of the leaders of the srivaishnava school sought to be his disciple. He was born in early 10th century CE and was the grandson of a Brahmin, Nathamuni. Nathamuni was a famed yogi who collected the works of Tamil alvars. Alavandar's birth star was Uttiradam.  Early life  He grew up learning Vedic texts from Rama Misra also known as Manakkal Nambi and was skilled in mimansa. SriVaishnavite legend relates this history‚ÄîAs a teenager he challenged the royal priest Akkiyalvan of the Pandya king (the name of the king is disputed). Akkiyalvan, when he saw the age of the youth, asked sarcastically \\"alavandara?\\" meaning \\"has he come to rule me?\\". He defeated Akkiyalvan by proving through the accepted rules of logic that Akkiyalvan's mother was barren, the king was not righteous and the queen unchaste. The king and queen, impressed that the boy has understood the shortcomings of logic, adopted him.The queen hailed the boy as \\"Alavandhaar\\"- the saviour. In other versions of the legend, he is given half the kingdom. There is no historical record to show his reign so it is possible that this happened in a smaller village rather than the kingdom of Pandya. After years of rule, Mannakal Nambi tricked him into visiting the temple of Ranganatha. There, he had an epiphany and gave up the material duties of a king and became a sanyasin embracing saranagati. He composed the chatushloki and Strotra Ratna at that spot. Mannakal Nambi handed over the reins of Natha Muni's school including the collected Divya Prabandha and renamed him Yamuna Muni or Yamunacharya. After the demise of Alavandar, Srirangam was led by the latter's son Thiruvarangan, however the place lacked the divine touch. According to a legend, Lord Ranganatha himself instructed Mahapurna to go to Kanchi and invite Ramanuja to Srirangam. * The names of Parashara and Veda Vyasa, should be commemorated on the earth by giving it to a person worthy to bear it. * Compose a commentary on Tiruvaymozhi of Nammalvar the most prolific of Alvars. * Compose a commentary on Upanishads, Vedanta Sutras and Bhagavad Gita.

Written by Ken Levine and David Isaacs and directed by Gene Reynolds, it first aired on October 5, 1976 and was repeated December 28, 1976. It features Hawkeye having to contend with sudden blindness after an accident. Plot synopsis Hawkeye is asked by the nurses to fix a malfunctioning stove in the nurses' tent. While doing so, a gas pocket builds up and explodes, flash burning and blinding Hawkeye. A specialist is called in to examine his eyes, and he is told he must keep them bandaged for a week, after which time the specialist will be able to tell whether the damage to his eyes is permanent. Hawkeye is initially despondent over the possibility of losing his sight and his surgical career. However, as the week goes on, he becomes fascinated by the stimulation of his other senses due to sensory deprivation. He also meets and bonds with patient Tom Straw (played by blind actor/singer Tom Sullivan) who was blinded in combat. He even participates in the OR; while unable to operate, he is able to give tips to the other surgeons due to his sense of smell and other clues, much to Frank's annoyance. Frank, meanwhile, has been steadily winning money from the rest of the staff camp by betting on baseball games. The key to his success is that he cheats by listening to the games on the radio the night before, when everyone else is asleep, and then suckers people listening to the rebroadcast into betting on the losing team. Hawkeye, aware of Frank's scheme, arranges it so that Frank's radio is connected to the camp PA, and then \\"broadcasts\\" a fake Indians-Yankees ballgame into it at night, with B.J., Klinger, and Radar providing background noise. Hawkeye ends his phony broadcast with the Indians winning 5-4. When the real game's final score (Yankees won, 8-1) is broadcast over the PA the next morning, Frank notices the different outcome, inadvertently blurts out that he listened to the game last night, and the other staff members immediately begin to accost him, demanding their lost money back. Finally, the specialist returns and removes the bandages, and Hawkeye, with great relief, announces that his sight is returned. However, shortly thereafter, Hawkeye appears in the nurses' tent with his eyes bandaged again, explaining that he had a relapse. However, this turns out to be just a ruse to trick the nurses into getting undressed in his presence, one that is easily exposed when he catches a cup one of the nurses throws to him. This prompts the nurses to kick him out their tent.

Biography Richard Polwhele's ancestors long held the manor of Treworgan, 4 3/4 miles south-east of Truro in Cornwall, which family bore as arms: Sable, a saltire engrailed ermine.Burke's General Armory, 1884 He was born at Truro, Cornwall, and met literary luminaries Catharine Macaulay and Hannah More at an early age. He was educated at Truro Grammar School, where he precociously published The Fate of Llewellyn. He went on to Christ Church, Oxford, continuing to write poetry, but left without taking a degree. In 1782 he was ordained a curate, married Loveday Warren, and moved to a curacy at Kenton, Devon. On his wife's death in 1793, Polwhele was left with three children. Later that year he married Mary Tyrrell, briefly taking up a curacy at Exmouth before being appointed to the small living of Manaccan in Cornwall in 1794. From 1806, when he took up a curacy at Kenwyn, Truro, he was non-resident at Manaccan: Polwhele angered Manaccan parishioners with his efforts to restore the church and vicarage. He maintained epistolary exchanges with Samuel Badcock, Macaulay, William Cowper, Erasmus Darwin, and Anna Seward. When in Devon, Polwhele had edited the two- volume work Poems Chiefly by Gentlemen of Devonshire and Cornwall (1792) for an Exeter literary society. However, Essays by a Society of Gentlemen at Exeter (1796) caused a rift between Polwhele and other society members. Polwhele had by this time begun the first of his two major county histories, the History of Devonshire. This appeared in 3 volumes, 1793‚Äì1806, but his coverage was uneven and subscribers deserted. His seven-volume History of Cornwall appeared 1803‚Äì1808, with a new edition in 1816. Polwhele's volumes of poetry included The Art of Eloquence, a didactic poem (1785), The Idylls, Epigrams, and Fragments of Theocritus, Bion, and Moschus, with the elegies of Tyrtaeus (1786), The English Orator (1796), Influence of Local Attachment (1796), and Poetic Trifles (1796). However, The Unsex'd Females, a Poem (1798), a defensive reaction to women's literary self-assertion, is today perhaps Polwhele's most notorious poetic production: in the poem Hannah More is Christ to Mary Wollstonecraft's Satan. Polwhele contributed to the Gentleman's Magazine and (1799-1805) to the Anti-Jacobin Review. He published sermons, theological essays for the Church Union Society, and attacks on Methodism (although he befriended his main Methodist antagonist Samuel Drew). At the end of his life, after retiring to his manor house of Polwhele, he worked to produce Traditions and Recollections (two volumes, 1826) and Biographical Sketches (three volumes, 1831). He died at Truro on 12 March 1838. He was buried at St Clement, Cornwall. Legacy His name survives in Polwhele House School, an independent preparatory school two miles from Truro.

Copy of the Greek original (440‚Äì430 BC) at the Capitoline Museums (Rome, Italy) Head of the Sosicles Amazon types, found in the Gardens of Maecenas, 1874 (Capitoline Museums) Pliny the Elder records five bronze statues of Amazons in the Artemision of Ephesus.Nat Hist. 34.75. He explains the existence of such a quantity of sculptures on the same theme in the same place by describing a 5th-century BC competition between the artists Polyclitus, Phidias, Kresilas, \\"Kydon\\"The designation of a \\"Kydon type\\" among surviving examples has been explained by a textual mistaking of Kresilas's place of birth - Kydonia - for the name of a fifth sculptor; Gisela Richter observed, however, that Kydon is not attested as an ethnic designation, but is well known as a given name (Richter, \\"Pliny's five Amazons\\", Archaeology 12 [1959:111-15]). and Phradmon; thus: This anecdote encouraged the much- discussed identifications of four known types of Roman marble copies of the wounded Amazon with sculptors of lost originals that may be dated to 430 BC on stylistic grounds. These types, each well represented by numerous Roman copies and heads, are identified with three of Pliny's five sculptors; a type derived from Phradmon has not been identified. Of these, however, only the identification of the Mattei type as deriving from Phidias's original is undisputed. The assignment of the Sciarra-type as deriving from Polyclitus's original and Sosicles-type as deriving from Kresilas's original (or vice versa), on the other hand, is unestablished, although having been discussed since 1897. The German scholar R. Bolnach has written a thorough form-analysis for the Sciarra/Polycletus and Sosikles/Kresilas pairings. Dietrich von Bothmer dismissed the Plinian anecdote as an etiological embroidery\\"Pliny's account... may well be an embroidered anecdote prompted by the presence of four statues of the same subject in the same sanctuary by different artists\\" (von Bothmer, Amazons in Greek Art, Oxford 1957:212, quoted in , p. 2). invented to account for the five statues of wounded Amazons of varying styles. Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway presented her doubts (\\"it is difficult to see why all five Amazons were set up if only one 'won' and became the object of the dedication\\"), noting Pliny's awareness of the discrepancies in age of the sculptors;\\"quamquam diversis aetatibus geniti\\". she presented an alternative, cumulative origin, building on fifth century prototypes, added to by Phradmon, whom she identifies as a fourth-century sculptor, and supplemented by later classicizing models.Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway, \\"A Story of Five Amazons\\", American Journal of Archaeology, 78.1 (January 1974:1-17). Types The usual designations of the statues, following Adolf Furtw√§ngler, group them under the headings the Lansdowne type, the Capitoline type, the Mattei type and the single example known as the Villa Doria Pamphilj type.Ridgeway 1974:2ff A fifth type was excavated at the theater of Ephesus in 1898 but did not enter the discussion until the 1950s. All five types show a standing female with a similar head and face, and (as with the Venus Genetrix) are clothed in a peplos that has fallen from one or both shoulders to leave her bare-breasted. Their differences are most obvious when the three sculptures, or casts thereof, are displayed together, as at the Casts Gallery at the Cambridge Classics Faculty. The pose, with one arm resting on the head, is comparable to that of the Apollo Lykeios. Mattei Amazon, Vatican Museum Wounded Amazon, \\"Lansdowne type\\", said to be after Polyclitus (Cast in Pushkin Museum) Amazon Mattei type The prototype was discovered in 1770, as a marble Roman copy of a bronze original, and came into the Mattei collection. 2.11m high, and of the Augustan era, this type is derived from Phidias's original. It is now on display in the Gallerie delle Statue of the Pio-Clementine Museum in the Vatican. The figure looks down, with her right arm parrying and her left arm by her side with a quiver under it, though both arms, the head, and the left shoulder are all restorations. Another copy of this type is at the Capitoline Museum. Amazon Sciarra type 1.94 m high, this copy dates to the era of Tiberius and is derived from Polyclitus's or Kresilas's original. It was found in Rome in 1868 in the Gardens of Sallust, and is now in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, Copenhagen,Accession number K176. The figure is resting her left arm on a column and her right hand behind her head, with her face leaning to one side. Her nose, right arm from the deltoid muscle downwards, the left forearm below the elbow, both hands, and the right foot and ankle have all been restored since discovery. Amazon \\"Capitoline\\" or Sosicles type Wounded Amazon, Roman copy signed by Sosikles This type is known principally from the 2.02 m high 2nd century AD marble copy (signed by Sosicles), deriving from Polyclitus's or Kresilas's original.; K√ºnstlerlexikon der Antike II (2004) 411 s.v. \\"Sosikles\\" (R. Vollkommer); Hans von Steuben: \\"Die Amazone des Polyklet\\", in: Polykletforschungen, ed. by Herbert Beck and Dieter Bol, Berlin 1993, pp. 73-102 It was discovered in 1733, went into the collection of Cardinal Giuseppe Albani, and is now in the Capitoline Museums, Rome (Room 33). The figure has her left arm across her body below her breasts, and her right hand raised and open-palmed, as she looks down towards the wound in her right-hand side. She wears a baldric. The tip of nose, lower lip, left forearm, and hand with drapery have been restored since discovery. It was (before and after Sosicles's time) copied as a complete statue, as a bust or as a herm, both in stone in the same size as the original and in miniature in bronze. Lansdowne Amazon A possible fourth is the Lansdowne Amazon, said to have been found in Tor Colombara by Gavin Hamilton, though it may be a variant on the Sciarra-type. Later at Lansdowne House, it is now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.Metropolitan Museum of Art. Half of the nose, the right arm from middle of the biceps to wrist, the tip of the thumb, and other details have been restored since discovery. File:Marble statue of a wounded Amazon MET DP278758.jpgdetail (Metropolitan Museum of Art) Villa Doria Pamphilj Amazon Adolf Furtw√§ngler attributed a much-restored Wounded Amazon at the Villa Doria Pamphilj, Rome, to the Ephesus group, an attribution that was challenged in 1951 by C.P. Sestieri,Sestieri, \\"Alla ricerca di Phradmon\\", 'ArchCl 3' (1951:13-32) p. 16, noted by Ridgway 1974:3 and note 10. who identified the sculpture instead as a classicising Roman work, and a representation of Diana.The dog is part of the extensive restoration; the remains of a hand resting on the head, not an attribute of Artemis/Diana, were noted by Ridgway 1974:4 Dietrich von Bothmer's systematic study omitted the Dori-Pamphilj sculpture as insecurely identified and too much restored, while H. von Steuben in W. Helbig, F√ºhrer durch die √∂ffentlichen Sammlungen klassischer Altert√ºmer in Rom, (T√ºbingen) 4th ed. identifies it as an eclectic classicizing work modelled on the Lansdowne Wounded Amazon.

He was joint Postmaster General from 1691 to 1715. Early life Frankland was the eldest son of Sir William Frankland, 1st Baronet and his wife Arabella Belasyse, daughter of Hon. Henry Belasyse (MP) of Newburgh Priory, Yorkshire. He was at Cambridge University from 1680 to 1681 and was admitted at Lincoln's Inn in 1683. He married Elizabeth Russell, daughter of Sir John Russell and Frances Cromwell (daughter of Oliver Cromwell), by licence dated 14 February 1683. Career Frankland entered Parliament at the 1685 English general election as Member of Parliament for Thirsk as a substitute for his father who was known as an exclusionist. He played no part in parliament, but was returned again at the 1689 English general election. He was appointed Commissioner for excise in April 1689, but lost the post in October when he was unable to subscribe to a government loan. Franklan was returned again as a Whig MP for Thirsk at the 1690 English general election and in February 1691 was appointed joint Postmaster-General with Sir Robert Cotton, a Tory, the post having been split to be shared between a Whig and a Tory. He held the post until 1715 and proved an assiduous postmaster, making many improvements, particularly with regard to overseas mail. However his Parliamentary activity was slight. He did not stand at the 1695 English general election, but was returned instead as MP for Hedon in a by-election on 7 December 1695. He signed the Association in February 1696 and voted with the Court for fixing the price of guineas at 22 shillings in March. He and Cotton were charged with improving laws related to the post office. He voted for the attainder of Sir John Fenwick on 25 November 1696. On the death of his father on 2 August 1697, he succeeded to the baronetcy. At the 1698 English general election he was returned again as MP for Thirsk. He presented a petition to the House of Commons on 23 February 1699, from the inhabitants and clothiers of Halifax, with regard to woollen manufacture. Frankland was returned unopposed again for Thirsk at the two general elections of 1701 and at the 1702 English general election. He started to use his interest in Yorkshire and in the Post Office to influence the results at other constituencies. At the 1705 English general election, he was returned unopposed for Thirsk again. He voted for the Court candidate for Speaker on 25 October 1705 and supported the Court in the proceedings on the ‚Äòplace clause‚Äô of the regency bill on 18 February 1706. He was returned again for Thirsk at the 1708 British general election and supported the naturalization of the Palatines. He became involved in the attempt of Dumfries Burgh to have their postal service to Carlisle established by Act of Parliament. The issue became wrapped up in the general attempts to improve the Union and other procedural matters and was lost in that parliament. Meanwhile Frankland voted for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell. He was returned again for Thirsk at the 1710 British general election and on 18 February 1711 he was appointed to the committee to draft a bill to establish a General Post Office for Great Britain and the dominions. At about this time he discovered that a clause in the first Lottery Act made his post as joint postmaster incompatible with a seat in Parliament. After voting against an amendment to the South Sea bill on 25 May 1711, he vacated his seat in Parliament. Frankland kept his place as joint postmaster-general until 1715 after the accession of George I, and was appointed as a Commissioner for customs until 1718 when he was too infirm to carry on. He was then given a pension of ¬£500 a year. He retired from public life. In 1722 he rebuilt the church at Thirkleby at his own expense. Death and legacy Frankland died on 30 October 1726, in his 62nd year, and was buried at Thirkleby. He left his lands to his eldest son Thomas, and more than ¬£13,000 divided between his other legatees, including his surviving family, servants and tenants He and his wife had nine children:Frankland genealogy * Thomas Frankland (c. 1685‚Äì1747), FRS, who succeeded his father in the baronetcy and was also MP for Thirsk and for Harwich * William Frankland (died 1714), FRS, Treasurer of the Stamp Office * John, died young in Hamburg * Henry Frankland, Governor of Bengal (died 1728), father of Sir Charles Frankland, 4th Baronet, and Sir Thomas Frankland, 5th Baronet * Richard Frankland (died 1761), DCL, commissioner of the Salt Office * Frederick Meinhardt Frankland (c. 1694‚Äì1768), barrister-at-law, MP for Thirsk * Robert Frankland, murdered in India * Mary (died 1722), who married Thomas Worsley of Hovingham Hall * Frances, who married Roger Talbot Two of his sons sat for Thirsk between 1713 and 1749 Thirkleby Hall was rebuilt in 1790, and Thirkleby church was replaced in 1851.

She was the wife of the Belgian Minister of Justice Albert Lilar and mother of the writer Fran√ßoise Mallet-Joris and the art historian Marie Fredericq-Lilar. She was a member of the Royal Academy of French Language and Literature from 1952 to 1992. Life Lilar's mother was a middle school teacher, her father a railway station master. After having lived her youth in Ghent, and following a brief first marriage, she moved to Antwerp where she became the first woman lawyer, and where in 1929 she married the lawyer Albert Lilar who would later become a Minister of Justice and Minister of State (Liberal Party). She was the mother of the writer Fran√ßoise Mallet-Joris (b. 1930) and the 18th century art historian Marie Fredericq-Lilar (b. 1934). After the death of her husband in 1976, she left Antwerp and relocated to Brussels in 1977. Education Suzanne Lilar by Charles Leirens, signed, 1950's In 1919 Lilar attended the State University of Ghent where she studied philosophy and was the first woman to receive a Law degree in 1925. During her studies she attended a seminar on Hadewych. Her interest in the 13th century poet and mystic would play an important role in her later essays, plays and novels. Lilar's historico- cultural insight, her analysis of consciousness and emotion, her search for beauty and love are at the same time current and timeless. Literary career Applying a strong intellect to her work through precise language, she was a thoroughly modern writer and feminist who nonetheless remained highly versed in many areas of traditional western thought (Encyclop√¶dia Britannica). In 1956 Lilar succeeds Gustave Van Zype as member of the Royal Academy of French Language and Literature. Her oeuvre has been translated in numerous languages. Early work Lilar began her literary career as a journalist, reporting on Republican Spain for the newspaper L'Ind√©pendance belge in 1931. She later became a playwright with Le Burlador (1946), an original reinterpretation of the myth of Don Juan from the female perspective that revealed a profound capacity for psychological analysis. She wrote two more plays, Tous les chemins m√®nent au ciel (1947), a theological drama set in a 14th-century convent, and Le Roi l√©preux (1951), a neo-Pirandellian play about the Crusades. Critical essays Her earliest essays are on the subject of the theatre. Soixante ans de th√©√¢tre belge (1952), originally published in New York City in 1950 as The Belgian Theater since 1890, emphasizes the importance of a Flemish tradition. She followed this with Journal de l'analogiste (1954), in which the origin of the experience of beauty and poetry was guided by a path of analogies. A short essay Th√©√¢tre et mythomanie was published in 1958. Transcendence and metamorphosis are central to her seminal work Le Couple (1963), translated in 1965 by Jonathan Griffin as Aspects of Love in Western Society. In writings on Rubens, the Androgyne or homosexuality in Ancient Greece, Lilar meditates on the role of the woman in conjugal love throughout the ages. Translated into Dutch in 1976, it includes an afterword by Marnix Gijsen. In the same vein she later wrote critical essays on Jean-Paul Sartre (√Ä propos de Sartre et de l'amour, 1967) and Simone de Beauvoir (Le Malentendu du Deuxi√®me Sexe, 1969). Autobiographical works, novels Lilar wrote two autobiographical books, Une Enfance gantoise (1976) and √Ä la recherche d'une enfance (1979), and two novels, both of which date from 1960, Le Divertissement portugais and La Confession anonyme, a neoplatonic idealization of love filtered through personal experience. The Belgian director Andr√© Delvaux recreated this novel on film as Benvenuta in 1983, transposed as an intense examination of a tortured but exalted relationship between a young Belgian woman and her Italian lover.

The picture was executive produced by Aqua Films' Ver√≥nica Cura and produced by Enrique Pi√±eyro. Plot The documentary portrays a behind-the-scenes look at the poor state of Argentina's civil aviation, and puts the blame on the Argentine Air Force. The Air Force has been in control of air traffic operations since the military takeover of General Juan Carlos Ongan√≠a in 1966. The producer/director, Enrique Pi√±eyro, claims Argentina and Nigeria are the only countries whose air force controls and regulates the airline industry. Pi√±eyro, a former Argentine airline pilot, makes his case in the documentary using diagrams, 3D animations, interviews, hidden cameras in the control tower, and a few props. For example, at one point he spills out a bag of plastic airplanes and equates it to the number of planes the air force has lost due to negligence. The film is heavily based on the Austral L√≠neas A√©reas Flight 2553 plane crash. Enrique Pi√±eyro takes his camera, secretly, into the control tower of the Ministro Pistarini International Airport also-known-as Ezeiza, the international airport at Buenos Aires. Background The basis of the documentary was Enrique Pi√±eyro's experiences in the Argentine aviation industry. Pi√±eyro was an airline pilot from 1988 to 1999, and resigned in June 1999. This is not the first documentary portraying the Argentine airline industry. In 2004 he wrote, directed, and produced Whisky Romeo Zulu, a film that depicted the general corrosive deregulation, greedy cost-cutting corporations, and corrupt government officials, found in the Argentine airline industry.

It contains two recognized species:Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families #Manicaria martiana Burret ‚Äì Colombia, northwestern Brazil #Manicaria saccifera Gaertn. ‚Äì Central America, Trinidad, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, northwestern Brazil It has one of the largest known leaves in the plant kingdom (up to 8 metres in length). Illustration Manicaria thrives in swamps or estuarine areas where river meets ocean. In the Tortuguero region of Costa Rica, where Manicaria saccifera is plentiful, local people know this palm as \\"Palma Real\\", or \\"Royal Palm\\". Its heavy, large leaves are valued over other palm species as the best material for roof thatching. Manicaria saccifera is an obligate swamp species, and as most other palms, it thrives in the wet, humid conditions of tropical lowland forests. Myers (1981) states \\"In the humid environments of the neo-tropics there is an increase in the abundance of understory palms\\" (24). Further to this, lowland forests generally have a higher density of palms than upland forests, and palms thrive better in poorly drained, wet soils than dry or well-drained soils. This particular palm can often be found mixed with Raphia palms in swamps and depressions. Description Germination stages Manicaria saccifera is easy to identify by the enormous, broad leaves and clusters of spiked fruit pods visible at the base of the fronds. The leaves grow in a pinnate shape, and resemble large feathers with irregular separation and serrated edges. They are stiff, tough leaves, and can actually give a sharp ‚Äúpaper cut‚Äù if the hand is brushed against them. The fruits grow in large clusters throughout the year, forming in shells that contain two or three seeds each. The pods fall from the tree and form mounds at the base. Eventually the spiked outer shell of the pod breaks away, revealing the smooth round seed underneath. Some mammals, such as peccaries, eat the white flesh found inside seeds that have fallen and emerged from the tough outer shell, but human consumption of this fruit is not common (Myers, 1981). Since the seeds can float for extended periods of time, water is the main seed distribution method for the Manicaria. Seed dispersal by animals is not effective; Myers (1981) found that seeds which were partially consumed or damaged by animals were not likely to germinate (See Fig. 1). Where mammal activity is high, seed and seedling predation are also very high, so the Manicaria tends to thrive only in swampy regions that are less frequented by mammals. Climate and geographical location Myers (1981) states that Manicaria saccifera is an obligate swamp species which grows in freshwater swamps that are frequently flooded by rain or ocean tides. They can often be located in estuarine areas where a river feeds into the ocean, so the rivers or canals along which Manicaria saccifera can be found often contain brackish water. This palm tends to dominate the middle strata with its broad leaves, and can often be found mixed with Raphia palm in depressions, bordering waterways, and in mixed dicotyledonous swamp forests (Myers, 1981). One important area of conservation where Manacaria continues to thrive is in the Tortuguero region on the northeast coast of Costa Rica. According to the Canadian Organization for Tropical Education and Rainforest Conservation (COTERC) (n.d.), the Tortuguero region is an ancient flood plain with a rainfall exceeding 6,000 mm annually and an average daily temperature of 26 degrees Celsius. This area is aseasonal (Myers, 1981) and is considered among the most biologically diverse regions in the country (Koens, Dieperink and Miranda, 2009; World Headquarters, 2007). There are two protected areas that make up much of the Tortuguero region: The Barra del Colorado Wildlife Refuge and Tortuguero National Park, both which lie within the √Årea de Conservaci√≥n Tortuguero (ACTO). Lowland forests and palm swamps in Costa Rica Density and local use of Manicaria saccifera in Tortuguero, Costa Rica To learn about the current state of the population and local use of Manicaria saccifera in more detail, an applied Anthropological study of this palm was conducted at the southernmost tip of the Barra del Colorado Wildlife Refuge in Costa Rica by a Laurentian University Anthropology field course, in conjunction with Ca√±o Palma Biological Station. The station lies along the Ca√±o Palma (Palm Canal) in Tortuguero National Park, which rests within the Barra del Colorado Wildlife Refuge. Ca√±o Palma is a palm-filled blackwater canal made up of hydromorphic soils that developed due to poor drainage (Myers, 1981) and has an average rainfall greater than 6,000 mm annually. This habitat is a prime location for Manicaria saccifera to grow and thrive. From an applied Anthropological approach, the biological and sociocultural aspects of this ecologically prominent palm species were considered. The study found that the density of the Manicaria palm was highest in wet, swampy habitat with lower density at all life stages within drier substrate. Thus, this palm thrives in a very specific habitat, and destruction of that habitat by commercial agricultural drainage of wetlands can impact the population negatively. Juvenile stage Manicaria saccifera Destruction of Manicaria saccifera habitat The construction of banana plantations in Costa Rica has had a negative impact on both ecological and social aspects. The cultivation of bananas requires large amounts of land, large amounts of fertilizers and pesticides, and extensive systems of shallow canals and drainage ditches (Astorga, 1998). This alteration of the landscape inevitably leads to deforestation, and the loss of tropical flora and fauna biodiversity. In order to develop a banana plantation, marshes are drained, streams are channelized, and drainage canals are constructed to prevent flooding of the fields (McCracken 1998). Historically the agricultural banana industry has been a threat to the Manicaria saccifera population in Costa Rica. The Manicaria grows and thrives in swampland and if these areas continue to be drained for agricultural use, this species of palm, along with many others will quickly disappear. Human use Many different species of palms have been useful to humans now and throughout history. Palms of all types can be used for \\"thatch for houses, wood to support dwellings, ropes, strings, weavings, hunting bows, fishing line, hooks, utensils, musical instruments, and various kinds of food and drink\\" (Kricher, 1997:28). In the Tortuguero region of Costa Rica, ‚ÄúPalma Real‚Äù is mainly valued for roof thatch. Historically, according to Lefevre (1992), the Tortuguero region was dominated by the Suerre people prior to the 16th century. The Suerre, according to linguistic analysis, are thought to be related to the Talamancan tribes from southern Costa Rica. The Suerre used Manicaria saccifera to thatch cone-shaped ranchos, and slept on palm floors. In 1502, Columbus encountered 50-80,000 people living in the area. The Miskito from Nicaragua immigrated into the area and primarily used palm thatch for their homes. Tortuguero village became a well-used shipping port for coconuts and bananas produced by local plantations. By 1930-1940 Walter Martinez, along with his children and two or three other families settled into the Tortuguero area and constructed four poled ranchos using palm (Lefevre, 1992). Around 1995-1996, Tortuguero‚Äôs houses were still primarily roofed with palm thatch. Manicaria saccifera was the preferred palm for thatching due to its wider leaves which cover more area. It was around this time that the permit system was introduced by the Costa Rican government to limit the harvesting of many natural resources, including the Manicaria. As of 2010, very few buildings have thatched roofs other than the ranchos that many tourist lodges provide for their guests. The permit system Wildlife conservation permits in Costa Rica were established in 1992 with the Ley de Conservacion de la Vida Silvestre, or the Law on Wildlife Conservation (hereafter referred to as Law 7317). It is possible that another permit system was in place before this law was introduced, but no evidence has been found to confirm or deny this. According to Article 1 of Law 7317, its purpose is to regulate and monitor the appropriation and trade of natural resources within Costa Rica and to assure any extraction is done so in a sustainable fashion. All natural resources are declared of the interest of the State and any extraction, anywhere in Costa Rica, requires a permit. More specifically, anyone in Costa Rica who wants to harvest Manicaria saccifera will need to obtain permission from MINAET to do so legally. The permit system is one of many possible factors contributing to a decline in thatch use in Costa Rica but should not be considered independent of other social and economic factors. Changing attitudes Research conducted during the Laurentian University field course indicates that there has been a drastic shift within the past few decades in regards to the use of Manicaria saccifera as roofing material for dwellings. Even though there were some obvious advantages to using the Manicaria saccifera for thatch, such as its durability and its ability to help cool down a building as well as being waterproof, many locals were actually moving away from using the palm as roofing material. There appears to be a variety of reasons for this decline including difficulty in obtaining permits, physical difficulty of harvest work in swamp areas, and undesirable creatures such as scorpions, snakes and bats making their homes in the thatch. It appeared that most people generally now prefer to use tin or plastic as their roofing material since it is relatively cheap and much easier to obtain and use than the Manicaria palm. Traditional harvesting and thatching The process of harvesting Manicaria saccifera leaves and using them to build a durable roof is a complicated process which requires a great deal of knowledge, effort, and skill. The size of leaves that are harvested for thatching purposes may vary with regard to the fact that Manicaria fronds may grow anywhere from two to seven meters tall, though most often leaves that are at least four to five meters in length are preferred. The number of leaves harvested from each tree also varies. Anywhere from 10 to 20 leaves are removed from a tree during a harvest, though most often locals indicated that 10 leaves are removed. Many leaves are needed to thatch a roof. For a house it may take anywhere between 400 and 7000 leaves, and a rancho may need 1000 to 2500 leaves. Although these numbers seem surprising, the numbers are actually fewer than if other plants were used, because the Manicaria leaves are so large. The best time to harvest leaves varies, although most locals seem to agree that one should harvest when the moon is in menguante (after the full moon), usually anywhere from 3 to 15 days. Most also agree that this is because natural pesticides found in the Manicaria saccifera are released at this time and prevent insects from damaging the roofing. In order to thatch a roof certain steps must be taken. First, one must get a permit and then collect the leaves. Once this is complete the leaves must be prepared for thatching. This is done by splitting the leaves in half by dragging a piece of wood lengthwise through the spines. When doing this it is important to be careful as the split leaf is very sharp, as ‚Äúsharp as a machete‚Äù. After the leaves have been cut they are attached to the roof frame either by the use of knots (the older technique) or by nails. The tradition of thatching is being lost within the Tortuguero region of Costa Rica. Fewer people are using thatch and since the process of learning thatch is done through observation, those of the younger generation may never have the opportunity to see a thatched roof being constructed and thus they may never learn. Yet despite this, most lodges still use palm thatch on ranchos, and with the growing tourism industry the tradition may not be completely lost to future generations. However, while it is possible that one may work at a lodge that does thatching and have an opportunity to learn how to thatch, it is apparent that overall the traditional usage of palm for non-tourist dwellings is dwindling, and few individuals are learning to harvest thatch properly in the traditional way. Conservation The Laurentian University field research indicates that during a Manicaria harvest, special attention is given to how much of each palm was harvested for thatching purposes. Mainly, it was indicated that least three leaves are left on each tree so that the palms were able to regenerate. Also, the harvest location was rotated to further ensure that regeneration of the Manicaria saccifera occurs. Although locals practice these two types of management to ensure that the palm does regenerate, they also indicated that they believe that this palm is a plant that will regenerate quickly and is not at risk of overharvesting, especially if done properly. In summary, research revealed that what is crucial in terms of the proper management of the Manicaria saccifera is regulating the clearing and draining of land for agriculture, highways, and other developments. As Manicaria saccifera only grows in wetland areas, clearing too many wetland areas can cause these its habitat to dry up. Continued appropriate conservation management in this important region and all wetlands where this important palm occurs will continue to ensure its survival. References Astorga, Y.

It is kinetically unstable at ambient temperature and pressure, being removed through autopolymerisation. Atomic carbon is the simplest form of carbon, and is also the progenitor of carbon clusters. In addition, it may be considered to be the graphite monomer.  Nomenclature  The trivial name monocarbon is the most commonly used and preferred IUPAC name. The systematic name carbon, a valid IUPAC name, is constructed according to the compositional nomenclature. However, as a compositional name, it does not distinguish between different forms of pure carbon. The systematic name Œª0-methane, also valid IUPAC name, is constructed according to the substitutive nomenclature. Along with monocarbon, this name does distinguish the titular compound as they derived using structural information about the molecule. To better reflect its structure, free atomic carbon is often written as [C]. Œª2-methylium () is the ion resulting from the gain of by atomic carbon.  Properties = Amphotericity  A Lewis acid can join with an electron pair of atomic carbon, and an electron pair of a Lewis base can join with atomic carbon by adduction: ::[C] + M ‚Üí [MC] :[C] + :L ‚Üí [CL] Because of this donation or acceptance of an adducted electron pair, atomic carbon has Lewis amphoteric character. Atomic carbon has the capacity to donate up to two electron pairs to Lewis acids, or accept up to two pairs from Lewis bases. A proton can join with the atomic carbon by protonation: :C + ‚Üí Because of this capture of the proton (), atomic carbon and its adducts of Lewis bases, such as water, also have Br√∏nsted‚ÄìLowry basic character. Atomic carbon's conjugate acid is Œª2-methylium (). : + C + Aqueous solutions of adducts are however, unstable due to hydration of the carbon centre and the Œª2-methylium group to produce Œª2-methanol (CHOH) or Œª2-methane (), or hydroxymethylium () groups, respectively. : + C ‚Üí CHOH : + ‚Üí The Œª2-methanol group in adducts can potentially isomerise to form formaldehyde, or be further hydrated to form methanediol. The hydroxymethylium group in adducts can potentially be further hydrated to form dihydroxymethylium (), or be oxidised by water to form formylium ().  Electromagnetic properties  The electrons in atomic carbon are distributed among the atomic orbitals according to the aufbau principle to produce unique quantum states, with corresponding energy levels. The state with the lowest energy level, or ground state, is a triplet diradical state (3P0). The first two excited states that are relatively close in energy are a singlet (1D2) and singlet diradical (1S0). The non-radical state of atomic carbon is systematically named Œª2-methylidene, and the diradical states that include the ground state is named carbon(2‚Ä¢) or Œª2-methanediyl. The 1D2 and 1S0 states lie 121.9 kJ mol‚àí1 and 259.0 kJ mol‚àí1 above the ground state, respectively. Transitions between these three states are formally forbidden from occurring due to the requirement of spin flipping and or electron pairing. This means that atomic carbon phosphoresces in the near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum at 981.1 nm. It can also fluoresce in infrared and phosphoresce in the blue region at 873.0 nm and 461.9 nm, respectively, upon excitation by ultraviolet radiation. The different states of atomic carbon exhibits varying chemical behaviours. For example, reactions of the triplet radical with non-radical species generally involves abstraction, whereas reactions of the singlet non-radical involves not only abstraction, but also addition by insertion. :[C]2‚Ä¢(3P0) + ‚Üí [CHOH] ‚Üí [CH] + [HO] :[C](1D2) + ‚Üí [CHOH] ‚Üí CO + or  Production  Making atomic carbon :C: - The source of light is the electrical arcing between two carbon rods. Liquid nitrogen cools the reaction vessel. The black substance is soot. This photo was taken in the Laboratory of Professor Phil Shevlin at Auburn University. This very short lived species is created by passing a large current through two adjacent carbon rods, generating an electric arc. Atomic carbon is generated in the process. Professor Phil Shevlin has done the principal work in the field based at Auburn University in the USA. The way this species is made is closely related to the formation of fullerenes C60, the chief difference being that a much lower vacuum is used in atomic carbon formation. Atomic carbon is generated in the thermolysis of 5-diazotetrazole upon extrusion of 3 equivalents of dinitrogen: CN6 ‚Üí :C: + 3N2 400x400px A clean source of atomic carbon can be obtained based on the thermal decomposition of tantalum carbide. In the developed source, carbon is loaded into a thin-walled tantalum tube. After being sealed, it is heated by direct electric current. The solvated carbon atoms diffuse to the outer surface of the tube and, when the temperature rises, the evaporation of atomic carbon from the surface of the tantalum tube is observed. The source provides purely carbon atoms without presence of any additional species.  Carbon suboxide decarbonylation  Atomic carbon can be produced by carbon suboxide decarbonylation. In this process, carbon suboxide decomposes to produce atomic carbon and carbon monoxide according to the equation: : ‚Üí 2 CO + [C] The process involves dicarbon monoxide as an intermediate, and occurs in two steps. Photolytic far ultraviolet radiation is needed for both decarbonylations. # ‚Üí [CCO] + CO #[CCO] ‚Üí CO + [C]  Uses  Normally, a sample of atomic carbon exists as a mixture of excited states in addition to the ground-state in thermodynamic equilibrium. Each state contributes differently to the reaction mechanisms that can take place. A simple test used to determine which state is involved is to make use of the diagnostic reaction of the triplet state with O2, if the reaction yield is unchanged it indicates that the singlet state is involved. The diradical ground-state normally undergoes abstraction reactions. Atomic carbon has been used to generate \\"true\\" carbenes by the abstraction of oxygen atoms from carbonyl groups: : R2C=O + :C: ‚Üí R2C: + CO Carbenes formed in this way will exhibit true carbenic behaviour. Carbenes prepared by other methods such as diazo compounds, might exhibit properties better attributed to the diazo compound used to make the carbene (which mimic carbene behaviour), rather than to the carbene itself. This is important from a mechanistic understanding of true carbene behaviour perspective.  Reactions  As atomic carbon is an electron-deficient species, it spontaneously autopolymerises in its pure form, or converts to an adduct upon treatment with a Lewis acid or base. Oxidation of atomic carbon gives carbon monoxide, whereas reduction gives Œª2-methane. Non-metals, including oxygen, strongly attack atomic carbon, forming divalent carbon compounds: :2 [C] + ‚Üí 2 CO Atomic carbon is highly reactive, most reactions are very exothermic. They are generally carried out in the gas phase at liquid nitrogen temperatures (77 K). Typical reactions with organic compounds include:Reactive Intermediate Chemistry, Robert A. Moss, Matthew S. Platz and Maitland Jones Jr., Wiley-Blackwell, (2004), :Insertion into a C-H bond in alkanes to form a carbene :Deoxygenation of carboxyl groups in ketones and aldehydhdes to form a carbene, 2-butanone forming 2-butanylidene. :Insertion into carbon -carbon double bonds to form a cyclopropylidene which undergoes ring-opening, a simple example being insertion into an alkene to form a cumulene. With water insertion into the O-H bond forms the carbene, H-C-OH that rearranges to formaldehyde, HCHO.

This differentiation and activation of the B cell occurs most rapidly after exposure to antigen by antigen-presenting cells in the reticuloendothelial system, and under modulation by T cells, and is closely intertwined with affinity maturation. B cells that respond most avidly to antigen are preferentially allowed to proliferate and mature, a process known as clonal selection. In lymphocytic neoplastic diseases such as multiple myeloma and lymphoma, but also other illnesses, there can be a massive expansion of a single B-cell clone, detectable by measuring the excessively- produced antibodies, measured in a serum protein electrophoresis test or peripheral blood flow cytometry. Such an expansion is said to be \\"monoclonal\\", and monoclonal antibodies produced by such a group of B cells can cause illnesses such as amyloidosis and lupus, or can be indicative of an underlying malignancy. The concept of clonality is closely associated with malignancy, for example in diagnosing lymphomatoid skin lesions. The expansion of a particular clone of immune B cells is usually interpreted by clinicians as evidence of unrestricted cell growth, the hallmark of cancer.

A graduate of the University of Miami undergraduate and law, he is an attorney and member of the Florida Bar since 1975. He is best known for filing the landmark 2002 case seeking a guardian for the world‚Äôs first alleged human clone, \\"Baby Eve.\\" The case has been widely credited for exposing Clonaid, the so-called \\"human cloning company\\" as a sham. Clonaid presented itself as the scientific research laboratory of a Canadian-based religious group called the R√§elian Movement. The R√§elians believe that cloning technology is a gift that will provide human immortality, brought to earth by extraterrestrials. They have collected large sums of money from at least one couple, allegedly to provide them with a child cloned from one of the parents‚Äô DNA. The legal hearings brought about by Siegel exposed the cult‚Äôs lack of credibility when they failed to produce an allegedly cloned child for the purpose of DNA testing, which would have proven whether or not the child was a clone. However, the case was the subject of intense international media attention because it shined a spotlight on the cloning issue and the emerging and enormously promising field of stem cell research. It was also the catalyst for Siegel to trade in his 30-year courtroom career to found the Genetics Policy Institute (now called the Regenerative Medicine Foundation). The Regenerative Medicine Foundation is now a world leader in supporting the global cause of stem cell research by promoting sound, ethical research within a framework of supportive public policy. The institute does this through public education initiatives, meetings among experts and activists, its comprehensive website and published information, and sponsorship of the Student Society for Stem Cell Research. In only three years‚Äô time, the SSSCR has grown into an education and advocacy organization having a presence in 15 countries, 35 states, 100 institutions and more than 25 active chapters at universities around the country. Since the 2002 legal case, Siegel has become a recognized policy expert relating to stem cell research, regenerative medicine and human cloning. He has appeared as an expert on the CBS Evening News with Dan Rather, CNN, CNN International, MSNBC, and network news shows throughout the U.S. and the world. He has been profiled on National Public Radio's All Things Considered and has been quoted in The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Boston Globe, The Times, Le Monde, Pravda, People's Daily and other publications throughout the U.S. and the world. Siegel gives frequent lectures on stem cells and public policy, speaking before the United Nations, international and U.S.-based biotechnology groups, and at numerous colleges and universities. In both 2003 and 2004, Siegel played a pivotal role in protecting a form of stem cell research in the United Nations, which was under the threat of being banned by world treaty. In 2003, he brought some of the world‚Äôs most prominent stem cell research scientists together at a meeting at the U.N. to educate delegates about the need to ban human reproductive cloning (the cloning of a whole person) while keeping nuclear transfer research (for the cloning of stem cells) legal throughout the world. That very year, the U.N. avoided the passage of a treaty that would have banned nuclear transfer research worldwide by a single vote. In 2004, the treaty was downgraded to a nonbinding resolution that left the matter of whether or not to allow nuclear transfer up to the various nations. Siegel‚Äôs work has been profiled in two books on stem cell research. Ian Wilmut described Mr. Siegel as an ‚Äúunsung hero‚Äù in his book, After Dolly: The Uses and Misuses of Human Cloning. Siegel‚Äôs exploits in court versus the R√§elians and in leading the battle to save stem cell research in the United Nations are the subject of an entire chapter, called ‚ÄúThe Battle for Hearts and Minds,‚Äù in \\"Stem Cell Wars: Inside Stories from the Frontlines\\" by Eve Herold (who is herself an official with the Genetics Policy Institute).

The space between the sleeve and the pipe is the annulus or annular space The annulus, or annular space, is the space between a penetrant and whatever surrounds it, such as the sides of an opening or a sleeve, as the case may be.

In practical terms, an offset penetrant or annulus may very well present an added degree of difficulty for passing the fire test. A metallic sleeve as well as a metallic penetrant will conduct heat through the firestop. Insulation on the bottom of floor systems or in the middle of wall systems, as is the case with caulking or paint based (soft) systems, will encourage more heat to travel through the sleeve and the penetrant, which can put more stress on the seal on the unexposed side. In the case of a thin (below 4\\") firestop mortar, there is also more potential hazard from tight annular spacing because metal expands during the fire, thus squeezing the firestop - only to rapidly shrink when hit with the hose-stream test, which can let water through, thus failing the H rating in Canada or the entire rating in the US, where hose-stream testing is mandatory. Such a failure may no longer be visible once the test assembly has reached ambient temperatures again. For all these considerations, the annular space is a critical aspect of field approvals.

The result was a victory for the Royalists.Roberts, pp. 86‚Äì89.  Background  After the Battle of Edgehill, King Charles I captured Banbury and was greeted by cheering crowds as he arrived in Oxford on 29 October. Prince Rupert swept down the Thames Valley, capturing Abingdon, Aylesbury and Maidenhead, from where he attempted to capture Windsor though failed due to Parliamentary strength there. Afterwards many officers wanted to open peace negotiations, contrary to Rupert's desire to carry on to London immediately. King Charles, however, agreed with the officers and as a result, the Earl of Essex was able ready the defense of London with the Parliamentarian army.  Prelude  While in Reading, Berkshire, King Charles decided that the peace talks were inconclusive and that if he advanced on London it would place him in a better negotiating position. So on 11 November he moved his army closer to London by encamping at Colnbrook at the edge of Middlesex and to put further pressure on the Parliamentarians he ordered Prince Rupert to take Brentford midway across the small county.Royle p. 204. Meanwhile the Earl of Essex had rapidly positioned men on the western approaches to London. One force covered the bridge at Kingston upon Thames while another, to the west, barricaded the small town of Brentford, the main crossing of a tributary to the Thames, concentrating their efforts in the proximity of the bridge that connected Old Brentford to New Brentford and the Bath Road (which passes Colnbrook) to London.Roberts, p. 87.  Battle  On 12 November under cover of an early morning mist Rupert's cavalry and dragoons attacked the two regiments of Parliamentary foot, one, Denzil Holles Regiment (although Holles was not present) and the other of Lord Brooke, which were barricaded inside Brentford. The initial attack by the cavaliers on Sir Richard Wynne's house, an outpost west of Brentford held by Holles's regiment, was repulsed. So a Welsh regiment of foot were ordered into action by Rupert. The combined force successfully captured the outpost and carried forward their attack into Brentford itself. They drove Holles's men over the bridge into the defences manned by Lord Brooke's men. These in turn were driven out of the town into open fields.Roberts, pp. 87‚Äì89. The fighting continued into late afternoon,Roberts, p. 89. before the survivors of Holles's and Brooke's regiments were able to disengage under the protection of John Hampden's infantry brigade, which arrived from Uxbridge to cover their withdrawal. Nevertheless, a large number of Holles's men drowned while trying to escape their pursuers by swimming across the Thames.Royle p. 205. The Royalists captured 15 guns and 11 colours and about 500 prisoners, including John Lilburne who was a captain in Brooke's regiment.  Aftermath  Having won the battle the Royalist forces sacked the town. This action encouraged those Londoners who feared for their property to side with the Parliamentarians. On 13 November the main Parliamentary army under the command of Earl of Essex's heavily reinforced with the London trainbands and other London citizenry, assemble as an army of about 24,000 on Chelsea Field and advanced to Turnham Green in the vicinity of the main body of the Royalist army.Royle p. 206. At a standoff known as the Battle of Turnham Green, the senior Parliamentarian officers not trusting the training of their forces in a battle of manoeuvre chose not to attack,Great Rebellion. and the King decided not to press his advance on London by giving battle against a greater force. He decided, as it was near the end of the campaigning season, to retreat to Oxford where his army could be billeted over the winter. Lilburne was the first prominent Roundhead captured in the war, the Royalists intended to try him for high treason. But when Parliament threatened to execute Royalist prisoners in reprisal, Lilburne was exchanged for a Royalist officer (the Declaration of Lex Talionis). Historians Roberts and Tincey cite Parliamentary propaganda pieces which include accusations of atrocities. One included accusations that the cavaliers used roundhead prisoners of war (captured at Keynote), as human shields ‚Äî \\"their cloths [clothes] were shot full of holes but all of them survived unharmed\\". They also note that in another publication of about the same period that Cavalier camp followers were accused of murdering wounded Roundhead soldiers. They argue that \\"The wide circulation of exaggerated accounts of these events helps to explain the growing antipathy of Parliamentarian soldiers to their Royalist opponents and helps to explain the mutilation of Royalist camp followers after the Battle of Naseby\\".Roberts p. 89.

Function  SOS1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) which interacts with RAS proteins to turn GDP into GTP, or from an inactive state to an active state to signal cell proliferation. RAS genes (e.g., MIM 190020) encode membrane-bound guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that function in the transduction of signals that control cell growth and differentiation. Binding of GTP activates RAS proteins, and subsequent hydrolysis of the bound GTP to GDP and phosphate inactivates signaling by these proteins. GTP binding can be catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors for RAS, and GTP hydrolysis can be accelerated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). The first exchange factor to be identified for RAS was the S. cerevisiae Cdc25 gene product. Genetic analysis indicated that CDC25 is essential for activation of RAS proteins. In Drosophila, the protein encoded by the 'son of sevenless' gene (Sos) contains a domain that shows sequence similarity with the catalytic domain of Cdc25. Sos may act as a positive regulator of RAS by promoting guanine nucleotide exchange.  Clinical significance  Recent studies also show that mutations in Sos1 can cause Noonan syndrome and hereditary gingival fibromatosis type 1.

Sabellidae can be found in subtidal habitats around the world. Their oldest fossils are known from the Early Jurassic. Characteristics Feather-duster worms have a crown of feeding appendages or radioles in two fan-shaped clusters projecting from their tubes when under water. Each radiole has paired side branches making a two-edged comb for filter feeding. Most species have a narrow collar below the head. The body segments are smooth and lack parapodia. The usually eight thoracic segments bear capillaries dorsally and hooked chaetae (bristles) ventrally. The abdominal segments are similar, but with the position of the capillaries and chaetae reversed. The posterior few abdominal segments may form a spoon-shaped hollow on the ventral side.

He is considered the founder of the contemporary city of Guadalajara in 1531, as well as other places in Nueva Galicia (western New Spain). Background O√±ate was born in 1504 in Vitoria, a town in the Basque province of √Ålava, Spain. His father was Juan Perez de O√±ate and his mother was Osa√±a Gonz√°lez.Simmons pp. 14-16 He was born into the House of Haro, whose origins go back to the Middle Ages. He was a grandson of Pedro de Baeza, Se√±or de Narrihondo, one of Spain's last feudal lords. He was a valued officer, a good executive, and one of the first millionaires in North America. He discovered the richest silver mines on the continent - the mines of Zacatecas, in the barren and desolate plateau where now stands the Mexican city of that name. Activities in New Spain O√±ate arrived in New Spain in 1524 as the assistant to Rodrigo de Albornoz. Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and king of Spain had made Albornoz auditor, one of five royal officials named to oversee Cort√©s's government in the colony. In New Spain, he was reunited with his twin nephews Juan and Vicente de Zald√≠var y O√±ate. Cristobal de Onate contracted marriage with Catalina de Salazar de la Cadena, daughter of Gonzalo de Salazar and Catalina De La Cadena Maluenda. This was Catalina's second marriage. Her maternal uncle Antonio De La Cadena Maluenda, was Treasurer of New Spain. Gonzalo Salazar was a high-ranking official in the Royal Treasury of the colony, and at times a member of the junta that ruled New Spain. In 1529 he was a part of the expedition of Nu√±o Beltr√°n de Guzm√°n that conquered the western part of Mexico (the current states of Nayarit, Jalisco, Colima, Aguascalientes and parts of Sinaloa, Zacatecas and San Luis Potos√≠). This brutal conquest took only a few years, and the newly conquered region became known as Nueva Galicia. The foundation of the cities of Compostela and Tepic in present-day Nayarit and Guadalajara and Zacatecas is attributed to O√±ate. In 1531 (probably January), O√±ate founded a small town near Nochistl√°n to which the name Guadalajara was given. Two years later Beltr√°n de Guzm√°n visited the city, and at the request of its inhabitants, who were fearful of Indian attacks and lacked sufficient water, he ordered it moved to Tonal√°. This occurred on May 24, 1533. Later, after Beltr√°n had returned to Spain, it was moved again, to a site near Tlacotan (northeast of modern Zapopan). This occurred probably between October 1541 and February of the following year. During the conquest of Zacatecas rich silver mines were discovered that made Crist√≥bal de O√±ate and his partners Diego de Ibarra and Juan de Tolosa among the richest men in New Spain. O√±ate settled at the P√°nuco mine in Zacatecas, where five of his six children were born. One of his sons, Juan de O√±ate, married Isabel de Tolosa Cortes-Moctezuma, granddaughter of conquistador Hernan Cortes and greatgranddaughter of the last Aztec Emperor Moctezuma Xocoyotzin. Juan became an explorer of western North America and founder of the first European settlement on the upper Rio Grande in the present U.S. state of New Mexico. Both Juan and his son Crist√≥bal served as Spanish governors of Nuevo Mexico. Crist√≥bal de O√±ate served as governor of the province of Nueva Galicia on three occasions. He attempted without success to suppress the Caxcan Indians during the Mixton War in 1541 and was later accused by Caxcan leader Francisco Tenamaztle of murdering and exploiting Indians.Cazares. Alberto The Debate about the Chichimeca War, 1531-1585. Zamora, Michoacan: El Colegio de Michoacan, 2000, pp.173-176 Besides being a conquistador, official and mineowner, he was a farmer, rancher and encomendero. Although he was a lieutenant of Beltr√°n de Guzm√°n, perhaps the bloodiest conquistador in the history of New Spain, Onate seems also to have had a more benign side. He was a benefactor of the cities he founded. A generous spirit, he offered meals to the needy on a daily basis throughout his entire life, and is said to have turned over the proceeds from his encomiendas to improve native villages. Today, ancient Indian tribes and reservations persist in Mexico and the American Southwest. In the cities Onate founded, many streets, businesses, and geographic locations bear his name. He established a dynasty that retained wealth and power for 300 years. Cristobal died in P√°nuco, Zacatecas, on October 6, 1567, and was interred in the parochial church there.

College career Davis played college football at the University of Colorado. 1976 Big 8 Championship 1976 NEAAll American Professional career Davis played for the National Football League's Oakland Raiders between 1978 and 1985. During that time he was a starter on the Raiders Super Bowl XV and Super Bowl XVIII winning teams. He finished his career with the San Diego Chargers in 1987. The biggest play of his career, and arguably one of the most crucial in Raider history, was his playoff game interception against the Cleveland Browns in January 1981, where he made the game-winning interception on a play known as Red Right 88. Cleveland, in the final minute, trailing 14-12 and in position for a game-winning field goal, attempted a pass into the end zone. (The Browns made this decision because windy conditions had already caused kicker Don Cockroft to miss two field-goal attempts, and they had also failed on two extra-point tries [one blocked, one aborted by a muffed snap], thus giving the Raiders their lead.) The pass from quarterback Brian Sipe fluttered in the strong wind, and Davis stepped in front of the receiver, Ozzie Newsome, and made the interception. Among the many ironies of this play was a bitter one for Cleveland: while Davis was a superb tackler and leader on defense, he rarely received the attention he deserved because he was a terrible pass- catcher and dropped many sure interceptions (like some other shaky-handed great defensive backs, Davis' career would have been perceived very differently if he'd played in recent years, due to advanced analytics and statistics that have shown cornerbacks and safeties can play superb football without forcing turnovers), only to come through on the biggest play of his career. The play sealed the win and propelled the Raiders into the AFC title game against the San Diego Chargers, and an eventual Super Bowl XV triumph over the Philadelphia Eagles. The Raiders thus became the first wild-card team to win the Super Bowl.

She was formerly the United States Assistant Attorney General in charge of environment and natural resources, a division of the United States Department of Justice. As such, she was the U.S.'s top environmental prosecutor. She resigned from this post on January 8, 2007. Personal Wooldridge grew up on a farm in Artois, California. She holds a bachelor's degree in political science and history from the University of California, Davis (1983). She graduated with a J.D. degree from Harvard Law School in 1987. She is admitted to practice law in the United States Supreme Court and in the state and federal courts of California. She lived with J. Steven Griles, whom she began dating while he was one of her supervisors at the United States Department of the Interior, and they were married in March, 2007, \\"three days after Griles pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about his relationship with Jack Abramoff and a previous romantic partner.\\" Career Prior to her service with the Department of Justice, Wooldridge served as Solicitor for the United States Department of the Interior, that agency's highest ranking lawyer, after being appointed by President George W. Bush in a recess appointment. Prior to her employment in that capacity, she served as Counselor to J. Steven Griles, Deputy Secretary of the United States Department of the Interior; she also served as Deputy Chief of Staff and Counselor for Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton, serving in that position beginning on January 31, 2001. Prior to her position with the Department of the Interior, Wooldridge worked as a lawyer in private practice in Sacramento, California (from 1987 to 1994, and again from 1999 to 2001), served as general counsel to the non-partisan California Fair Political Practices Commission (2000), and served as a special assistant attorney general in the California Department of Justice). Controversies In February 2007, it was reported that in March 2006 Wooldridge had purchased a $980,000 vacation homephoto on Kiawah Island, South Carolina, together with two other individuals: Don R. Duncan vice president for Federal and International Affairs and a lobbyist for ConocoPhillips(a Houston-based oil corporation) and J. Steven Griles, a former Deputy Interior Secretary of the United States (now an oil and gas lobbyist). Griles later pled guilty to obstruction of justice in the Jack Abramoff affair. Nine months after buying the home with Duncan and Griles, and just before stepping down, Wooldridge approved consent decrees giving ConocoPhillips three more years to pay millions of dollars in fines for a Superfund toxic waste cleanup and install pollution controls (which are estimated to cost US$525 million) at nine of its refineries. After she resigned as Assistant Attorney General for Environment and Natural Resources Division (\\"ENRD\\" ) a newspaper allegation was made against Ms. Wooldridge that she acted improperly by jointly purchasing a vacation home at Kiawah Island, South Carolina with J. Steven Griles, her then boyfriend at the time and former Deputy Secretary at the Department of Interior (\\"DOI\\") and with their long-time friend Donald R. Duncan a lobbyist for ConocoPhillips. The assertion was made that she acted improperly by approving several consent decrees in litigation between the government and ConocoPhillips, supposedly giving the company preferential treatment. These allegations received wide circulation in the press and on Capitol Hill, to the great detriment to her reputation. A thorough and complete investigation into these allegations by the Department of Justice (\\"DOJ\\") established that Ms Wooldridge had not committed any impropriety.

The Guardian (22 May 2012) (accessed 14 May 2013) History There is a long tradition of geography at Cambridge stretching back to the first University Lecturer in Geography appointed in 1888. Teaching was initially for a special examination leading to a diploma in geography. The Geographical Tripos - the examination for a B.A. degree - was established in 1919. In 1931 the first professor was appointed and in 1933 the department moved into its own accommodation. That building, which now constitutes the eastern end of the department, was considerably extended in the 1930s, with the construction of new lecture theatres and laboratories. In the 1980s, the building was further extended with the addition of a top floor to provide a new laboratory for computing, remote sensing and geographical information systems. In 1999 the department expanded again, to occupy two floors in an adjacent building where new laboratories, seminar rooms and offices are housed. Since then, the Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure and the University of Cambridge Centre for Gender Studies have been integrated into the teaching and research activities of the Department (2001), and the Scott Polar Research Institute become a sub- department in 2002.

He was the last living member of the team of artists who worked with Diego Rivera on the Detroit Industry muralLinda Banks Downs, Diego Rivera: The Detroit Industry Murals, W.W. Norton & Company, Inc., New York, 1999 which is in the central courtyard, Rivera Court, of the Detroit Institute of Arts. Early life Davis was raised by his English father and Sephardic Spanish Jewish mother immigrant parents in Philadelphia. His mother had wanted to name him Pablo, his father wanted to name him after a recently deceased uncle in England, Percival. An elder sister explained the boy would be tormented at that time in this country if named Percival, so the parents compromised with \\"Paul\\"--or so his mother thought. He worked as a coal miner at age 14 until he became involved in a violent strike. When appearing before a judge for his riot involvement, \\"Paul\\" learned his father had secretly created his legal birth certificate with the name Percival. Obviously, not knowing it to be his name and resenting his father's deception, he never went by Percival. After this strike he saw an ad in the paper noting Diego Rivera was to begin work on a mural at the Detroit art museum. He rode the rails to Detroit for the purpose of meeting the artist. Upon arriving in Detroit, he asked train yard workers where the museum was, but none knew. When he found it, guards would not permit his entry but a woman came out as he sat on the front steps and said, \\"You look like you just lost your best friend.\\" He explained his deep desire to meet the great artist, and as this woman was Frida Kahlo, she took him into the museum with her and introduced the two. Diego Rivera examined some of Pablo's artistry and allowed him to assist in the layering of Rivera's fresco mural still on view in the museum. Pablo lived with Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo for some months while in Detroit. When the Spanish Civil War broke, partially out of loyalty to his Spanish mother, he went to fight ‚Äì not knowing this would later be considered a crime by his own country because America had not yet \\"officially\\" named fascism a crime. He served in the American volunteer Abraham Lincoln Brigade during the Spanish Civil War. Between his work with Rivera and his volunteer fighting in the Spanish Civil War, the curiosity of Pablo Picasso was aroused. When Davis was injured and recovering, Picasso came to visit and asked him to come stay with him. Soon after, U.S. government officials came to visit him as well, telling him upon his recovery he would be returned to U.S. soil to stand charges for \\"premature antifascism\\". Davis claimed that he and the then House Unamerican Activities Committee lawyer Richard Nixon squared off in a shouting match when he was called to testify before the committee. Davis stated that he changed his name in the 1950s after being arrested for serving as president of the Communist Party in America, which was then perceived by some artists and intellectuals as a means to develop true equality. This can be verified in the Denver, Colorado, newspaper of the time, including a photograph of him sitting behind bars. Born Paul Kleinbord, he attended high school in Philadelphia, along with Irvin Penn. (The two remained in contact until Penn's death.) After graduation he went on to attend art school for a period of time, also in Philadelphia. He married a second time and his wife gave birth to a son, his first wife having been, in his words, \\"a stunning beauty\\" but after marriage he discovered she was hermaphroditic. The first wife sought divorce for Pablo's sake. During the 1930s and early 1940s he was living in Philadelphia and didn't leave for any significant period of time. About 1945 he was sent to a sanatorium in Denver, CO because he had contracted tuberculosis. He remained in Denver until the early 1950s which is when he arrived in Detroit with his third wife. He lived in Ann Arbor for a period of time, then moved to Detroit. He continued to wear the wedding rings from his marriages on his ring finger. Artistic career Detroit Industry, South Wall, 1932‚Äì33. Detroit Institute of Arts Davis is the last surviving artist who worked on this project. Davis's work ranges from representational post-impressionism to highly abstract expressionism. Much of Davis's art is influenced by the cubism of Pablo Picasso, whom he claimed to have studied under and worked with in Europe. His other major influence was Diego Rivera and the other Mexican muralists. Davis assisted Diego Rivera on the Detroit Industry mural panels in Rivera Court in the Detroit Institute of Arts. Davis said that he painted a \\"Dick Tracy\\"-like face on one of the figures when Rivera asked for a tough-looking figure.Detroit News Article on Davis's role in Detroit Industry He also assisted Rivera on a mural painted inside the Ford Motor Company's Rouge Plant, in Dearborn, Michigan. Davis's painting of Michigan Governor John Swainson is hung in rotunda of the Michigan Capitol Building. He also painted commissioned portraits of celebrities including Katharine Hepburn and Marilyn Monroe. Davis is also known for his community mural projects in which he works with young people to produce large-scale co-operatively produced paintings. At least two of these murals can be found in Southwest Detroit.Examples of Davis's community murals Davis was a longtime member of Detroit's Scarab Club, a gallery and social venue for leading Detroit artists. His autograph is found on the club's ceiling beam along with the autographs of Diego Rivera, Norman Rockwell and John Sloan. Signing the ceiling beams is a Scarab Club tradition honoring distinguished guests and members.Beamlist_Updated_2011.pdf Community activism Davis resided in Southwest Detroit, the heart of the city's barrio and the home to many enclave neighborhoods of great cultural and ethnic diversity. From the 1980s Davis was active in an ecumenical project seeking to unite this community around the development of senior housing and services for children, first through the community-based group Ecumenical Project SAVE and later Bridging Communities, Inc. This activism resulted in an 80-unit senior affordable housing project known as the \\"Pablo Davis Elder Living Center\\". Although an avowed communist and revolutionary, Davis asserted he was comfortable working with this mostly religious and Christian group.Solidarity article on Bridging Communities project Later years In 2005, Madonna University students Christina Warren and Adam Guth received a grant from the Michigan Campus Compact to make a film about Davis's role in Detroit Industry.Posting of documentary film grant award The documentary, The Life and Art of Pablo Davis, was released in December 2006.

He later served one term in the United States House of Representatives representing West Virginia's 2nd congressional district(1864-1866), as well as became U.S. Consul in Melbourne, Australia (1867-1870) before returning to West Virginia to farm and hold various civic offices. Early and family life Born near Haymarket, Prince William County, Virginia, on March 9, 1832, Latham received an education suited to his class, then read law. In 1857 in Taylor County, Latham married the former Caroline Thayer (1834-1928), daughter of blacksmith Franklin Thayer (1803-1878), who had been born in Massachusetts but married Virginian Nancy Mason and raised their children in Virginia. In the 1860 census, Latham's young family in Grafton in Taylor County also included Caroline's 15-year-old sister and two printers, presumably boarders.1870 U.S. Federal Census for Taylor County, Virginia, family no. 785 By 1870, Franklin Taylor was incapacitated and had moved from Boothsville in Marion County to Pruntytown in Taylor County (at the intersection of the Northwestern Turnpike and the Beverly/Fairmont Road), and was the head of a household which consisted of his wife, three sons (including West Virginia infantry veteran Franklin T.

By 1860, he was publishing a weekly newspaper, the Western Virginian with a motto \\"the Constitution, the Union and the Enforcement of the Laws\\" and which endorsed the Constitutional Union Party slate consisting of John Bell of Tennessee and Edward Everett of Massachusetts.George Wesley Atkinson and Alvaro Franklin Gibbens, Prominent Men of West Virginia (W.L. Callin 1890) p. 405, available at https://books.google.com/books?id=vLYUAAAAYAAJ&pg;=PA404&lpg; Latham soon commanded the local militia, the Grafton Guards. When contrary to the wishes of western Virginia delegates, the Virginia Secession Convention of 1861 voted for secession on April 17 and various Virginia militia units seized the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry the following day, Latham and his Grafton Guards protected their railroads. The Clarksburg Resolution called for western Virginians to meet at Wheeling on May 13, 1861, before the vote, and Latham became active Taylor County's primary for delegates to the Wheeling Convention. Days after Virginians (over the opposition of western Virginians) voted to secede from the Union on May 23, Latham and his Grafton Guards took the train to Wheeling where they became Company B of the 2nd West Virginia Infantry Regiment. Thus, Latham began serving in the Union Army as captain. Latham was promoted to colonel of the 6th West Virginia Cavalry Regiment. However, he was court-martialed for neglect of duty in allowing the B&O; railroad's New Creek Station to be captured by Confederates in November 1864 with almost no resistance.http://www.wvculture.org/history/sesquicentennial/18641128.html Although convicted and sentenced to be dismissed from the service, perhaps because senior authorities recognized the number of times the station changed hands and the size of the raiding force, Latham nonetheless returned to duty and was brevetted brigadier general on March 13, 1865, days after the court martial conviction was reversed and shortly before he was honorably discharged.National Archives, RG 153, Entry 15A, Court martial case file NN-3449 West Virginia voters elected Latham an Unconditional Unionist to the United States House of Representatives in 1864, and he served from 1865 to 1867, but did not seek re-election.

He was returned unopposed as MP for the family borough of Thirsk at the 1713 and 1715 general elections. In 1715 he was appointed to the post of Clerk of the Deliveries of the Ordnance which he held until 1722. He was returned unopposed for Thirsk at the 1722 general election and was appointed to the post of Commissioner of Revenue (Ireland) in 1724. He succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his father on 30 October 1726. Returned again for Thirsk in 1727 he changed post to become a Member of the Board of Trade in 1728.

It is located on nearly and is the largest site owned by the PHMC, Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission. The staff at Daniel Boone Homestead interpret the lives of the three main families that lived at the Homestead: the Boones, the Maugridges and the DeTurks. The park is just off U.S. Route 422 north of Birdsboro in Exeter Township. Homestead=Squire Boone In 1730, Squire Boone, Daniel Boone's father, built a log cabin in the Oley Valley in what is now Berks County near present-day Reading. Daniel Boone was born in the -story log house. One wall was built of native stone. The basement of the house served as a spring house. It provided easy access to water for cleaning, cooking and drinking. The springhouse also was useful for cold storage. Squire Boone expanded his property in 1741 when he purchased of land for use as a pasture for his dairy cattle. Squire Boone was a blacksmith and weaver. The responsibility for tending the cattle was given to Daniel. During the summer months he stayed in a rustic cabin at the edge of the pasture. From there he was able to protect the cattle from predators such as the black bear, bobcat, and mountain lions. The Boone family became a source of controversy in the local Quaker community. In 1742, Boone's parents were compelled to publicly apologize after their eldest child Sarah married a non-Quaker. When Boone's oldest brother Israel also married a non-Quaker in 1747, Squire Boone stood by his son and was therefore expelled from the Quakers, although his wife continued to attend monthly meetings with her children. Perhaps as a result of this controversy, in 1750 Squire sold his land and moved the family south. The Boones eventually settled on the Yadkin River, in what is now Davie County, North Carolina, about two miles (3 km) west of Mocksville. Maugridge and DeTurk Ownership of the Daniel Boone Homestead was transferred in 1750 to William Maugridge, a relative of the Boones from Philadelphia and an associate of Benjamin Franklin. He was a shipwright and carpenter. The home underwent an expansion either just before or just after the time that it was transferred to Maugridge. This addition created a two-story house. The house featured a typical hall and parlor as well as a \\"bible closet\\". Maugridge died in 1766 and the property was then purchased by John DeTurk. DeTurk remodeled the house completely. He removed the walls of the log cabin and had them rebuilt with stone. DeTurk may have also built the smokehouse that can be seen today at the park. Several other farmers owned the land in the years following DeTurk's death before an effort to preserve it for historical purposes was undertaken in 1926. Restoration The Wayside Lodge at Daniel Boone Homestead. Built in 1940. The Reverend A. B. Vossler of nearby Birdsboro, Pennsylvania purchased the farm with the help of William C. Foote of East Orange, New Jersey in 1926. They later sold it to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1937 in order to preserve and protect the homestead of Daniel Boone. Restoration began soon afterward and many examples of colonial life in the Oley Valley have been moved to the site of the Daniel Boone Homestead. A circa 1769 blacksmith's shop has been restored at the park as well as the \\"Bertolet House,\\" an example of early 18th-century Pennsylvania German architecture. Daniel Boone's youth Daniel Boone was born on October 22, 1734. Because the Gregorian calendar was adopted during Boone's lifetime, his birth date is given as November 2, 1734 (the \\"New Style\\" date), although Boone always used the October date. He was the sixth of eleven children in a family of Quakers. His father, Squire Boone (1696‚Äì1765), had immigrated to Pennsylvania from the small town of Bradninch, England in 1713. Squire Boone's parents George and Mary Boone followed their son to Pennsylvania in 1717, and in 1720 built a log cabin at Boonecroft. Note: This includes In 1720, Squire, who worked primarily as a weaver and a blacksmith, married Sarah Morgan (1700‚Äì1777), whose family members were Quakers from Wales. Boone spent his early years on what was then the western edge of the Pennsylvania frontier. The pacifist Quakers generally had good relations with the Native Americans‚Äîbut the steady growth of the white population compelled many Indians to relocate further west. Boone received his first rifle in 1749, beginning his lifelong love of hunting. Folk tales often emphasized Boone's skills as a hunter. In one story, the young Boone is hunting in the woods with some other boys. The scream of a panther scatters the boys, except for Boone, who calmly cocks his squirrel gun and shoots the animal through the heart just as it leaps at him. As with so many tales about Boone, the story may or may not be true, but it was told so often that it became part of the popular image of the man.

Atomic domains are different from unique factorization domains in that this decomposition of an element into irreducibles need not be unique; stated differently, an irreducible element is not necessarily a prime element. Important examples of atomic domains include the class of all unique factorization domains and all Noetherian domains. More generally, any integral domain satisfying the ascending chain condition on principal ideals (i.e. the ACCP), is an atomic domain. Although the converse is claimed to hold in Cohn's paper,P.M. Cohn, Bezout rings and their subrings; Proc. Camb. Phil.Soc. 64 (1968) 251‚Äì264 this is known to be false.A. Grams, Atomic rings and the ascending chain condition for principal ideals. Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 75 (1974), 321‚Äì329. The term \\"atomic\\" is due to P. M. Cohn, who called an irreducible element of an integral domain an \\"atom\\". Motivation In this section, a ring can be viewed as merely an abstract set in which one can perform the operations of addition and multiplication; analogous to the integers. The ring of integers (that is, the set of integers with the natural operations of addition and multiplication) satisfy many important properties. One such property is the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. Thus, when considering abstract rings, a natural question to ask is under what conditions such a theorem holds. Since a unique factorization domain is precisely a ring in which an analogue of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic holds, this question is readily answered. However, one notices that there are two aspects of the fundamental theorem of the arithmetic; that is, any integer is the finite product of prime numbers, as well as that this product is unique up to rearrangement (and multiplication by units). Therefore, it is also natural to ask under what conditions particular elements of a ring can be \\"decomposed\\" without requiring uniqueness. The concept of an atomic domain addresses this. Definition Let R be an integral domain. If every non-zero non-unit x of R can be written as a product of irreducible elements, R is referred to as an atomic domain. (The product is necessarily finite, since infinite products are not defined in ring theory. Such a product is allowed to involve the same irreducible element more than once as a factor.) Any such expression is called a factorization of x. Special cases In an atomic domain, it is possible that different factorizations of the same element x have different lengths. It is even possible that among the factorizations of x there is no bound on the number of irreducible factors. If on the contrary the number of factors is bounded for every nonzero nonunit x, then R is a bounded factorization domain (BFD); formally this means that for each such x there exists an integer N such that with none of the xi invertible implies n < N. If such a bound exists, no chain of proper divisors from x to 1 can exceed this bound in length (since the quotient at every step can be factored, producing a factorization of x with at least one irreducible factor for each step of the chain), so there cannot be any infinite strictly ascending chain of principal ideals of R. That condition, called ascending chain condition on principal ideals or ACCP, is strictly weaker than the BFD condition, and strictly stronger than the atomic condition (in other words, even if there exist infinite chains of proper divisors, it can still be that every x possesses a finite factorizationD. D. Anderson, D. F. Anderson, M. Zafrullah, Factorization in integral domains; J. Pure and Applied Algebra 69 (1990) 1‚Äì19). Two independent conditions that are both strictly stronger than the BFD condition are the half-factorial domain condition (HFD: any two factorizations of any given x have the same length), and the finite factorization domain condition (FFD: any x has but a finite number of non-associate divisors). Every unique factorization domain obviously satisfies these two conditions, but neither implies unique factorization. References * P.M. Cohn, Bezout rings and their subrings, 1968.

The breed was imported to the United States in the nineteenth century, and to Britain and Australia early in the twentieth century. It derives from the indigenous Siciliana breed of Sicily, but long separation from the original stock has led to marked differences between the two.  History  Gallus turcicus, from the Ornithologiae tomus alter of Ulisse Aldrovandi (1522‚Äì1605) The Siciliana breed of Sicily appears to derive from ancient inter-breeding of local birds with North African stock such as the rose-combed Berbera breed or the Tripolitana described by Tucci. These birds may have been similar to the \\"Gallus turcicus\\" described by Ulisse Aldrovandi in 1600. Similar chickens are depicted in sixteenth-century paintings in the Vatican Museums and the Galleria Borghese in Rome, and in Florence and Paris. In about 1863 or 1877, a certain Cephas Dawes of Dedham, Massachusetts, captain of the Frutiere, was loading oranges in Sicily and bought a number of chickens to provide meat on his homeward journey. Some of these continued to lay well during the voyage, and were kept for eggs instead. Some of them were later sold to one C. Carroll Loring, also of Dedham, who became the first breeder of what would later become the Sicilian Buttercup. All American Buttercups, however, descend from a later shipment of hatchlings, in 1892. A breeders' association, the American Buttercup Club, was formed the United States in 1912, and by 1914 had 600 members; a similar association formed in Britain in 1913.

Our Lady of Awaiting, also known as Our Lady of Mantara, is a Melkite Greek Catholic Marian shrine in Maghdouch√©, Lebanon, discovered on 8 September 1721 by a young shepherd. The grotto, which according to a legend dates to ancient times, was subsequently cared after by Monsignor Eftemios Sa√Øfi, Melkite Catholic bishop of the Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Sidon. The shrine consists of a tower crowned with the statue of the Virgin and Child, a cathedral, a cemetery and a sacred cave believed to be the one where the Virgin Mary rested while she waited for Jesus. Since its discovery, it has been steadily visited by families particularly each year on the occasion of the feast of the Nativity of Mary on 8 September.http://www.lorientlejour.com/article/988517/maghdouche-au-liban-sud- a-rejoint-le-cercle-de-lourdes-de-fatima-et-de-medugorje.html History=Ancient era Many historians agree that the devotion to the Virgin Mary in Lebanon replaced the Phoenician worship of Astarte. Temples and shrines to Astarte were converted to Christian places of worship, honoring the Virgin. This is also true in Magdhdouch√© where within the vicinity of Our Lady of Awaiting are the remains of a shrine to Astarte. Middle Ages During the reign of Emperor Constantine, his mother, Saint Helena of Constantinople, requested in 324 D.C. the destruction of all pagan temples and idols dedicated to Astarte. The Astarte shrine in Magdhdouch√© was probably destroyed at that time and converted to a place of devotion to the Holy Mother.maghdouche.pipop.org Since the early Christian era, the inhabitants of Magdhdouch√© have venerated the cave where the Virgin Mary rested while she waited for her son, Jesus to finish preaching in Sidon. Saint Helena asked the Bishop of Tyre to consecrate a little chapel at the cave in Magdhdouch√©. She sent the people of Magdhdouch√© an icon of the mother and child and some altar furnishings. Historians believe that Saint Helena asked the people to name the chapel, and they named it \\"Our Lady of Awaiting\\" because it was there that the holy mother waited for her son.Maghdouche, Lebanon Mantara is derivative of the Semitic root ntr, which means ‚Äúto wait.\\" Saint Helena provided funds from the imperial treasury for the maintenance of the chapel. The funding continued for three centuries of Byzantine rule in Phoenicia until Khalid ibn al-Walid defeated Emperor Heraclius at the Battle of the Yarmuk. While the caliphate, Omar, who became ruler of Jerusalem, was a pious and humble man, sparing Christendom's holiest shrines and being tolerant of his Christian subjects, the Arab rulers of the rest of Byzantium were less tolerant of the Christians, especially in the maritime cities of Tyre, Sidon, Beirut, Byblos, and Tripoli. After the majority of the Sidonians converted to Islam to receive promised privileges and immunities, the people of Magdhdouch√© withdrew to higher elevation up Mount Lebanon. The caliphate had recognised the Christians of Mount Lebanon as autonomous communities, paying a fixed tax. Before abandoning their village, they concealed the entrance to the cave of Our Lady of Awaiting with stones, earth and vines. The people left the village through obscure mountain paths to the strongholds of Christian Lebanon. The legend of Our Lady of Awaiting was passed down to the exiled generations of Magdhdouch√© for one thousand years. The people of Magdhdouch√© did not return to their ancestral home despite the arrival of the Crusaders in Sidon. The Crusaders spent most of the 12th and 13th centuries in the shadow of Magdhdouch√© without ever suspecting the sacred cave's existence even though they built a small fort, called La Franche Garde, within meters of the hidden entrance to the cave. Modern era The people of Magdhdouch√© only returned to their ancestral village during the reign of the Druze Prince Fakhreddin II (1572-1635). The prince, who was considered a tolerant and enlightened ruler of his day and age, believed in equality amongst the diverse religious followers of his Lebanon. To demonstrate this equality, he appointed a Maronite Catholic as Prime Minister, a Muslim as Minister of the Interior, a Druze as Army Commander and a Jew as Finance Minister. His reign was a rare example of non- sectarianism, and it soon became the most prosperous principality in the Ottoman Empire. It was not easy to relocate the sacred cave even though the men of Magdhdouch√© worked for hundreds of years near the grotto, pulling down the stones of the Crusader fort for building material for their new homes. The cave was finally rediscovered on 8 September 1721 by a young shepherd when one of his goats fell in a well-like opening in the porous limestone. Wanting to save his goat, the shepherd made a rope from vine twigs, tied it to a tree, and descended into the hole, but the rope broke and he fell. When his eyes became accustomed to the darkness of the grotto, the boy saw a soft glimmer of a golden object, which turned out to be Saint Helena‚Äôs, icon of the Mother and Child. The boy climbed up the stone walls and ran to the village to tell his discovery. Pilgrimage site Ever since the rediscovery, the cave of Our Lady of Awaiting has been open to the public. It has become a major pilgrimage site in the Lebanon. The adjacent hilltop where Jesus and Mary had once stood is now Sidon's Greek Catholic cemetery. Grand festivities are held each year on September 8 to commemorate the rediscovery of the sacred cave. Near the sacred cave, the people of Magdhdouch√© built a cathedral and a modern tower crowned with a bronze statue of the Virgin and Child. The tower offers pilgrims panoramic views of Sidon, the Mediterranean, and the lush hills, valleys and citrus groves of Lebanon.

It was part of a Royalist campaign led by King Charles I to take control of the Severn Valley from the Parliamentarians. Following the costly storming of Bristol on 26 July, Charles invested Gloucester in the hope that a show of force would prompt it to surrender quickly and without bloodshed. When the city, under the governorship of Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Massey, refused, the Royalists attempted to bombard it into submission. Massey adopted an aggressive defence, and the Royalist positions outside the city were regularly disrupted by Parliamentarian raids. The Royalist artillery proved inadequate for the task of siege work and, faced with a shortage of ammunition, the besiegers attempted to breach the city walls by mining. With Royalist miners about to reach the city's east gate and the defenders critically low on gunpowder, a Parliamentarian army led by the Earl of Essex arrived and forced Charles to lift the siege. Prelude alt=Painting Following the Royalist defeat at the Battle of Edgehill in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to Cornwall, Wales and the Marches, and a pocket of the Thames Valley around Oxford, where he based his wartime capital. The ruling Puritan elite of Gloucester ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his Catholic Queen. Possession of Gloucester, along with Bristol to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales. An unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in Cirencester in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in Gloucestershire to muster the militia, and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester. In February 1643 the Royalist commander Prince Rupert easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at Berkeley, Sudeley and Tewkesbury. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by Lord Herbert of Raglan arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir William Waller defeated it on 24 March. The defeat of Waller in the Battle of Roundway Down on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, seized Bristol. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city. Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted King Charles I to travel to Bristol for a council of war. He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray. Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen Henrietta Maria, who believed a march on London could end the war. The capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at Worcester and Shrewsbury to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire ‚Äì populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian ‚Äì could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur. On 6 August the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Massey, refused to surrender the city, but in a secret communication he let it be known that he would do so if the King, rather than Rupert, led the army on Gloucester. Charles decided the next day that this was the best chance of securing Gloucester quickly and without bloodshed. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight. Gloucester defences alt=Map Gloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined castle by the river and a stretch of wall that linked the south, east and original north gates, the last known as the inner north gate and now well within the city, still survived. From the south gate to the east gate the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations. The fall of Bristol prompted the hurried reinforcement of the existing defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from the south gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to the outer north gate. From there the River Twyver formed a moat as the earthwork followed it north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn. This easternmost channel of the River Severn had dried up by the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river. The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west to a point a short distance north of Westgate Street, from where it was extended the other side of the Old Severn to the River Severn just above the west gate. Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at the inner north gate via Gloucester Cathedral to St Oswald's Priory, where it met the new outer earthwork. The outer north gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork bastions, a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood. The garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the Earl of Stamford's Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of trained band, 100 dragoons and a troop of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine- pounder demi-culverins. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline. The Town Regiment lacked experience but was motivated by its ties to the city it was defending, although there is evidence that some of its men would refuse to oppose the King. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege. alt=Painting Massey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but Thomas Pury, the member of parliament for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen aldermen, including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated. In the days immediately following the fall of Bristol, morale in the city, both military and civilian, was low. It's possible that this was what prompted Massey to consider surrendering the city, though his message suggesting he would may have been a subterfuge designed to buy some time. There is strong evidence that the conduct and actions of the city elite, including Massey and particularly Pury, did much to stiffen the city's resolve in the days immediately before the siege began. Officers and councillors with Royalist sympathies were given the opportunity to leave, and those who remained were required to restate an oath of allegiance to Parliament. The discipline of the troops was improved by paying them, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences. Siege As Charles marched north from Bristol, Royalist reinforcements were converging on Gloucester from Oxford, Worcester and Herefordshire. By the afternoon of 10 August the Royalist army, comprising some 6,000 infantry and 2,500 mounted troops, began assembling around the city. Charles set up his headquarters at Matson House. His demand for Gloucester's surrender was unanimously and somewhat insolently rejected, and the Parliamentarians set fire to the suburbs outside the city defences to clear lines of fire and deprive the Royalists of cover. Charles had decided to march on Gloucester in the belief that the city would be quickly surrendered. Now that gambit had failed, he decided to besiege it. His pride had been wounded by the manner of the Parliamentarian rejection. His commanders, assessing the state of the city's defences, supplies and morale, persuaded him the city could be taken within ten days without an assault. Intelligence indicated the even if the Parliamentarians were able to send a relieving force, it could be easily defeated before it could reach the city. Most decisively, the Earl of Newcastle, whose support was necessary in any campaign against London, declared himself unable to march south while Hull remained in Parliamentarian hands, leaving Charles too weak to contemplate such a move. First ten days alt=Map The first shots were fired in the afternoon as Sir Jacob Astley established his forces near Issold's House on the eastern side of the city. Lord Forth, who had been given overall command of the siege, set up a fortified leaguer to the rear of the ruined Llanthony Secunda Priory and established his forces to the south of the city. By dawn on 11 August, a line of trenches had been dug some from the walls, placing the two sides within musket range of each other, stretching from Gaudy Green on the south side to Issold's House on the east. Massey responded with spoiling tactics in an attempt to hinder Royalist siege operations and delay the assault he was expecting. At midnight a small raiding party succeeded in disrupting Royalist entrenching operations on Gaudy Green, and a larger raid on the green the next morning, 12 August, resulted in the capture of Royalist men, tools and weapons. By this time, the reinforcements from Herefordshire and Worcester under the command of Sir William Vavasour arrived on the west bank of the Severn and began crossing the river to take up positions at Kingsholm, to the north of the city. This force increased the size of the besieging army by another 2,400 infantry and over 300 cavalry. They too were the target of a Parliamentarian raid which inflicted up to fifteen casualties. Later on 12 August, Forth completed an earthwork square on Gaudy Green, in which he placed two 24-pounders, the largest of the Royalist's eight cannon, along with a 12-pounder to target the south wall. Another artillery emplacement was positioned nearby to target the east wall. With the artillery in place, the Royalists began bombarding the walls, the main effort beginning at 11:00 on 13 August. The cannon were too light to have any significant impact, and of the two mortars the Royalists possessed, one, reputed to be the largest in the country, exploded on its first use. When it became evident the Royalists were focusing their efforts on the south-east corner of the city defences, Massey quickly buttressed the medieval walls with up to of earth, which ensured that the defences held. Meanwhile, the majority of Vavasour's troops completed their crossing of the Severn, leaving behind a small contingent to blockade the west bank. Reacting to rumours that Vavasour had received a reinforcement of artillery, the Parliamentarians mounted another raid to the north of the city on 14 August. They captured two prisoners but failed in their primary objective of locating and spiking any guns. The Royalist bombardment continued through 14 August, but a breach blown in the wall by the larger guns on Gaudy Green was quickly plugged by the defenders with woolsacks and gabions. Royalist engineers mining towards the walls from trenches at the green succeeded in draining the ditch below the walls, but this was not followed up with an assault. By the end of the day the Royalist guns had fallen silent; the evidence suggests they had run out of ammunition. The following day Vavasour received a reinforcement of 500 Glamorgan militia and 450 musketeers from Bristol, while the Parliamentarians bolstered the earthwork defences around the south and north gates. On 16 August Rupert accompanied Charles to Oxford, and neither were at Gloucester to witness the most ambitious Parliamentarian raid yet. Just before sunset, 150 musketeers of Stamford's regiment sallied out of the north gate to attack the Royalist trenches east of the city. The Parliamentarians claimed 100 Royalist killed for the cost of 2 injured, while Royalist sources report 24 Parliamentarians killed and more wounded, for the loss of 4 Royalists killed. Struggling with a shortage of gunpowder and with the guns quiet, the Royalists concentrated on mining operations to breach the city walls. Miners recruited from the Forest of Dean were set to work under a protective gallery to fill the deep by wide moat which, when completed, would allow them to undermine the walls. It was slow work, estimated to need a week to complete. The faster alternative was to forgo the protection and fill the moat with fascines. An attempt to do this was beaten back by musket fire from the walls, and resulted in the desertion of the miners. By 18 August Vavasour had deployed three cannon in front of his main camp at Kingsholm and another opposite Alvin Gate. These were the targets of a Parliamentarian raid that morning that was even larger than previous efforts; a diversionary attack by 50 men and a main force of 400. All four of Vavasour's cannon were disabled, the Parliamentarians claiming over 100 Royalist casualties for the loss of 6, the Royalists admitting 28 casualties and claiming to have killed 27 Parliamentarians. Another Parliamentarian raid the same day involved their only recorded use of cavalry during the siege, when 150 musketeers and 40 cavalry mounted an ineffectual attack on Royalist positions to the east of the city. Charles, meanwhile, was on his way back to Gloucester with another 1,000 reinforcements. By the morning of 19 August, two 6-pounder cannon had been installed in a third emplacement opposite the east gate, bringing all the original artillery online. At 10:00, the bombardment was resumed in a last effort to subdue the city by the original ten-day deadline. Constrained by the limited supplies of ammunition and gunpowder, the bombardment had little material effect, though it prompted Massey to hastily erect a breastwork in the open ground of Friar's Orchard, at the south east corner of the city where the Royalist artillery was being concentrated. A Royalist attempt to cross the moat after dark was beaten back by musket fire. The objective of forcing the surrender of Gloucester by siege in ten days had failed, partly due to the city's resolve and Massey's spoiling attacks, but mainly due to the inadequacy of the Royalist artillery. Shift of focus to mining alt=Drawing The Parliamentarians mounted another raid at dawn on 21 August. It was a two- pronged attack designed to disable the Royalist artillery south and east of the walls. One detachment travelled by boat down the Severn, landed between Forth's camp and a redoubt opposite the castle and successfully stormed the redoubt. The second detachment of 200 musketeers sallied from the north gate. Intending first to attack the battery opposite the east gate, this force became lost and blundered into Royalist infantry camps. When Massey saw that the raid was not going to plan, he sounded the recall. The Parliamentarians suffered eight casualties, the Royalists more than twenty. Such raids were proving risky and wasteful of the garrison's limited ammunition, and this was the last large-scale operation mounted by the Parliamentarians. As the Royalists set about replenishing their stocks of ammunition, they intensified their mining efforts. It was anticipated that the original effort to bridge the moat would allow the besiegers to reach the east wall on 24 August. A second effort to bridge the moat to the south was begun, as was a more complicated project to tunnel towards the east gate. Royalist agents attempted to persuade the garrison to surrender, and Royalist cavalry staged a mock battle in an unsuccessful attempt to lure the garrison out of the city in the belief that a relief force had arrived. A desultory bombardment was maintained, particularly by the mortars, until 25 August, when it was intensified. An attempt that day by Massey to disrupt it with a sally from the north gate was beaten back by cavalry, but as before, a shortage of ammunition ‚Äì at one stage the Royalists resorted to firing stones ‚Äì blunted the impact, and little damage was done to the city. Following news that the Earl of Essex was raising a Parliamentarian army in London, Charles and Rupert travelled to Oxford on 26 August, where they held a two-day council of war. With no intelligence of Essex's plans, the Royalists bolstered the defences of Oxford with troops earmarked for the siege of Gloucester while the Royalist garrison at Bristol was urged to send all the forces it could spare to Gloucester. Believing that Essex could muster no more than 6,000 troops, the decision was made to continue the siege, though contingency plans for the blockade of Gloucester were drawn up in case it had to be lifted. Lord Wilmot was instructed to muster 2,000 cavalry around Banbury. Their task would be to delay the Parliamentarians in the Cotswolds until Rupert could come up with the rest of the Royalist cavalry in support, should Essex march to the relief of Gloucester. Essex began his march from Colnbrook, west of London, on 26 August. His plan was to relieve Gloucester without provoking a major battle in which, with the Royalist superiority in cavalry, he would be at a disdvantage. His route was dictated by the desire to minimise the amount of open country favourable to cavalry operations he would have to pass through, and took him north of Oxford via Aylesbury and Bicester and then across the Cotswolds. At the beginning of September Essex was due north of Oxford with an army of some 10,500 infantry, no more than 4,500 mounted troops and an artillery train that is estimated at no more than 50 guns. Mining was now the principal tactic by which the Royalists hoped to bring the siege to a successful conclusion. Priority was given to tunnelling at the east gate, which caused progress on efforts to fill the moat below the south and east walls to slow, possibly as a result of a lack of miners and engineers. Parliamentarian countermining at the east gate on 28 August was quickly abandoned because of springs that caused flooding, which accounts for the slow pace of the Royalist efforts there. Massey continued to harass the besiegers with sniping and artillery fire, and he resumed countermining operations at the east gate after a reconnaissance party had reported Royalists miners were still working on their mine. The progress of the Royalist mines closer towards the walls, quickened by the arrival of Welsh miners on 29 August, led Massey to believe an assault was imminent. On 1 September he fortified Friars Orchard with an earthwork wall and sconce, a fort in which he placed four pieces of artillery that could be brought to bear on any Royalists who broke through the south-east corner or the east gate. On 3 September the Parliamentarians placed a saker in a gun port they had been secretly building in east wall above the gallery protecting the Royalist miners. The medium-sized cannon was employed most of the day against the gallery, to little effect, until the Royalists targeted it with a cannon of their own, at which point it was withdrawn. The Royalists anticipated their mine would reach the east gate the next day, while they believed Essex could be delayed in the Cotswolds for four days. The Bristol garrison was being stripped for reinforcements and orders had been sent to Oxford for ten field guns and the equipment necessary to make the guns already at Gloucester mobile, should it become necessary to redeploy them from siegework to use in open battle. Approach of the relief army alt=Map By the end of 3 September Essex's lead element, the London brigade, was at Oddington, east of Stow-on-the-Wold. The Parliamentarian army was largely untroubled by Wilmot's Royalist cavalry, and because of the differing rates of march it was strung out as far back as Chipping Norton, nearly to the east. Meanwhile, Rupert had led the rest of the Royalist cavalry from Gloucester and, having rendezvoused with Wilmot, ended the day with some 5,000 men camped around Bourton-on-the-Water, south-west of Stow. The next day the two forces clashed. Although Rupert enjoyed superior numbers, he was dissuaded from pressing his advantage by the appearance of Edmund Harvey with a regiment of Parliamentarian cavalry and two of infantry. When Essex arrived with the rest of the Parliamentarian army, Rupert was forced into a steady retreat to the area of Andoversford and Compton Abdale, while Essex's army ended the day around Naunton. Rupert had been surprised by the size of Essex's force and the skill with which it was handled, and had completely failed in his mission to delay it. In Gloucester the Parliamentarians could see the evacuation of some 400 sick or wounded Royalists and the dispatch of some artillery away from the siege, but also the arrival of 2,000 infantry and 500 mounted reinforcements from Bristol. The defender's countermine reached outside the east gate, where they discovered and began boring down on the deeper Royalist mine, while inside the gate an earthwork was completed across the road and the buildings either side were turned into blockhouses. They were critically low on gunpowder, but buoyed by the sight of fires lit on nearby Wainlode Hill signalling the approach of Essex. The Royalists, meanwhile, were readying the heavy guns to move. On 5 September Essex took the quickest way off the open country of the Cotswold hills down into the relative safety of the Severn valley. This meant descending the steep escarpment at Prestbury Hill towards Cheltenham, rather than heading directly to Gloucester. His lead elements began the difficult descent at dusk, but the baggage train and rearguard were forced to spend the night in worsening weather in the hills. Rupert, who appears to have expected a more direct march on Gloucester, was not in a position to harass the Parliamentarians, and returned to Gloucester. There he covered the Royalist army as it lifted the siege and withdrew to Matson, south-east of the city. Charles had already departed his headquarters there and ridden ahead to Painswick. The defenders inside the city did not know how close Essex was and, not quite believing the siege was over, remained vigilant behind their defences rather than attempt to harass the retreating Royalists. Aftermath alt=Drawing Royalist casualties during the siege were claimed to be in the range of 1,000 to over 1,500, the Parliamentarian losses ranging from 30 to 50. Royalist sources concede 120 killed during the siege, with reports of sick and wounded giving numbers of 900, 400 and 300. Jon Day gives a conservative estimate of Royalist casualties as 1,200 killed, wounded and sick, with another 800 lost to desertion. The siege had come close to succeeding, and by the end of it the defenders were down to their last barrels of gunpowder. It is unlikely they would have been able to withstand an assault, but because of Charles's aversion to casualties, none was ever attempted. Massey's aggressive tactics were a critical factor in the successful defence of the city, and ensured that morale never dropped to the low levels witnessed before the siege began. The Royalists specifically identified his countermining as the reason for lifting the siege. The Royalist artillery proved inadequate to the task of siege work, and the 300‚Äì400 large cannonballs and 20+ mortar bombs that were fired on the city failed to blow any major breach in the walls, start any significant fires or cause more than a handful of casualties. Although the failure at Gloucester adversely affected Royalist morale, the campaign presented Charles with an opportunity to inflict a decisive blow against his enemy. The Parliamentarian army and its trained band reserves had effectively been lured out of a strong position behind the London defences, into open country where they could be more easily defeated. Against a Parliamentarian army some 14,500 strong, the Royalist army of 9,000 infantry and 6,000 cavalry was slightly inferior in the quantity of infantry but superior in cavalry by a factor of three to two. The arrival of additional guns ordered from Oxford during the siege gave the Royalists parity in artillery. Essex's objective after the siege was to evade the Royalist army and return his own intact to London. In a feint designed to draw Charles away from his intended route back to London, Essex marched north to Tewkesbury, where he could better supply his army and threaten Royalist Worcester. When Charles marched his army after him, Essex retraced his steps back to Cheltenham. With the Royalists concentrated around Evesham and Pershore, Essex was able to march back up into the Cotswolds in the direction of Cirencester, where he defeated the 400-strong Royalist garrison on 16 September. Essex believed he had established a commanding lead over Charles and, not wishing to drive his hungry army too hard, slowed his pace on the march to Swindon. He was further slowed after Swindon when Rupert's cavalry caught up, and the resulting Battle of Aldbourne Chase on 18 September allowed the rest of the Royalist army to close the distance. Charles finally brought Essex to battle on 20 September in the First Battle of Newbury, but failed to defeat him, allowing the Parliamentarians to reach the safety of their London stronghold four days later. Gloucester resumed its role as a logistic base for local operations and remained a Parliamentarian centre for the rest of the war, though Massey was removed as governor in 1645 over suspicions about his loyalty. By 1649 the burden of maintaining the garrison was generating divisions within the city. In 1651 a Scottish army moved south in support of the Royalists, prompting the city to restore its fortifications and raise a new town regiment. The garrison was withdrawn two years later, but in 1659, the city became increasingly divided as support for Parliament dissipated. Pury raised 300 troops to defend Gloucester for Parliament, while Massey, now a Royalist, plotted its capture. As the war came to an end Massey returned to and was elected as the member of parliament for Gloucester. After the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, King Charles II ordered Gloucester's walls to be demolished. In 1956 Professor David Daube suggested that the nursery rhyme Humpty Dumpty originated from a siege engine used at Gloucester, based on a contemporary account of the attack, but without evidence that the rhyme was connected. The theory was part of an anonymous series of articles on the origin of nursery rhymes and was widely acclaimed in academia, but it was derided by others as \\"ingenuity for ingenuity's sake\\" and declared to be a spoof. In 2009 the annual Gloucester Day ‚Äì a tradition begun after the siege to celebrate its lifting ‚Äì was resurrected, having died out in the 19th century.

It was opened in December 1868, initially as the Argyle Music Hall. The theatre had seating for about 800, with pillars in the auditorium and long, narrow galleries running down either side. Its name was changed in 1876 to the Prince Of Wales Theatre and for several years plays were performed, before the name \\"Argyle\\" was eventually restored. The owner and manager between 1888 and 1934 was Dennis J. Clarke, a local councillor, shrewd businessman and entrepreneur, with a keen eye for talent. He was both popular and well respected and was responsible for helping launch numerous showbusiness careers. Established artistes such as W.C. Fields, Dan Leno and Marie Lloyd performed during the early years of the theatre's life. Stars such as Charlie Chaplin, Bud Flanagan & Chesney Allen, Harry Lauder, Stan Laurel, George Formby (Senior) and Eric Morecambe & Ernie Wise performed at the Argyle Theatre at the beginning of their careers. The comedian, actor and ukulele player George Formby (Junior) made one of his earliest performances at the Argyle Theatre in 1921. In this instance, he was not a success and was booed off stage. In addition to the wealth of talent performing at the Argyle in person, it had other claims to fame. Clarke stated in 1896 that his theatre's vitagraph display was the first such display of moving pictures in England, outside London. The Argyle also had the distinction of being the first theatre to host radio broadcasts. On 21 September 1940, the theatre received a direct hit during the Blitz of World War II and never re-opened. However, the shell of the building remained in situ until 1973, when finally it was demolished. The theatre was mentioned in the famous 1971 Morecambe and Wise sketch that featured conductor Andr√© Previn. Previn was told that the booked guest, Yehudi Menuhin, had cancelled because he was \\"opening at the Argyle Theatre, Birkenhead in Old King Cole\\". A large, decorative stone sign that was once attached to the Argyle Theatre's exterior was moved to the Williamson Art Gallery for preservation, prior to demolition. The inscription on the sign read: \\"Argyle Theatre Of Varieties. Two Performances Nightly\\". A department store car park now occupies the site and a play, \\"Argyle Remembered\\", was written to commemorate the theatre.

It was named as such because scientists used to believe it was antigenic. Now it is known that it makes up the inner shell, not the envelope exposed outside. It makes up all the structural units of viral conformation and provides supportive framework for mature virion. All orthoretroviral gag proteins are processed by the protease (PR or pro) into MA (matrix), CA (capsid), NC (nucleocapsid) parts, and sometimes more. If Gag fails to cleave into its subunits, virion fails to mature and remains uninfective. It comprises part of the gag-onc fusion protein. Gag in HIV=Numbering system By convention, the HIV genome is numbered according to HIV-1 group M subtype B reference strain HXB2. Transcription and mRNA processing After a virus enters a target cell, the viral genome is integrated into the host cell chromatin. RNA polymerase II then transcribes the 9181 nucleotide full-length viral RNA. HIV Gag protein is encoded by the HIV gag gene, HXB2 nucleotides 790-2292. MA The HIV p17 matrix protein (MA) is a 17 kDa protein, of 132 amino acids, which comprises the N-terminus of the Gag polyprotein. It is responsible for targeting Gag polyprotein to the plasma membrane via interaction with PI(4,5)P2 through its highly basic region (HBR). HIV MA also makes contacts with the HIV trans- membrane glycoprotein gp41 in the assembled virus and, indeed, may have a critical role in recruiting Env glycoproteins to viral budding sites. Once Gag is translated on ribosomes, Gag polyproteins are myristoylated at their N-terminal glycine residues by N-myristoyltransferase 1. This is a critical modification for plasma membrane targeting. In the membrane-unbound form, the MA myristoyl fatty acid tail is sequestered in a hydrophobic pocket in the core of the MA protein. Recognition of plasma membrane PI(4,5)P2 by the MA HBR activates the \\"myristoyl switch\\", wherein the myristoyl group is extruded from its hydrophobic pocket in MA and embedded in the plasma membrane. In parallel to (or possibly concomitant with) myristoyl switch activation, the arachidonic acid moiety of PI(4,5)P2 is extracted from the plasma membrane and binds in a channel on the surface of MA (which is distinct from that previously occupied by the MA myristoyl group. HIV Gag is then tightly bound to the membrane surface via three interactions: 1) that between the MA HBR and the PI(4,5)P2 inositol phosphate, 2) that between the extruded myristoyl tail of MA and the hydrophobic interior of the plasma membrane, and 3) that between the PI(4,5)P2 arachidonic acid moiety and the hydrophobic channel along the MA surface. CA The p24 capsid protein (CA) is a 24 kDa protein fused to the C-terminus of MA in the unprocessed HIV Gag polyprotein. After viral maturation, CA forms the viral capsid. CA has two generally recognized domains, the C-terminal domain (CTD) and the N-terminal domain (NTD). The CA CTD and NTD have distinct roles during HIV budding and capsid structure. When a Western blot test is used to detect HIV infection, p24 is one of the three major proteins tested for, along with gp120/gp160 and gp41. SP1 Spacer peptide 1 (SP1, previously 'p2') is a 14-amino acid polypeptide intervening between CA and NC. Cleavage of the CA-SP1 junction is the final step in viral maturation, which allows CA to condense into the viral capsid. SP1 is unstructured in solution but, in the presence of less polar solvents or at high polypeptide concentrations, it adopts an Œ±-helical structure. In scientific research, western blots for CA (24 kDa) can indicate a maturation defect by the high relative presence of a 25 kDa band (uncleaved CA-SP1). SP1 plays a critical role in HIV particle assembly, although the exact nature of its role and the physiological relevance of SP1 structural dynamics are unknown. NC The HIV nucleocapsid protein (NC) is a 7 kDa zinc finger protein in the Gag polyprotein and which, after viral maturation, forms the viral nucleocapsid. NC recruits full-length viral genomic RNA to nascent virions. SP2 Spacer peptide 2 (SP2, previously 'p1') is a 16-amino acid polypeptide of unknown function which separates Gag proteins NC and p6. p6 HIV p6 is a 6 kDa polypeptide at the C-terminus of the Gag polyprotein. It recruits cellular proteins TSG101 (a component of ESCRT-I) and ALIX to initiate virus particle budding from the plasma membrane. p6 has no known function in the mature virus. In endogenous retroviruses  Both Human endogenous retrovirus K and Human Endogenous Retrovirus-W copies carry gag genes, usually damaged, that are expressed widely. There is a long history of speculating their involvement in multiple sclerosis and other neurological disorders. In other viruses The gag gene of Spumaretrovirinae (e.g. ) and Metaviridae (e.g. ) only have a recognizable nucleocapsid part. It also lacks a myristoylation sequence. The Spumaretroviral (SV) gag is related to orthoretrovieral gag, as structural work has shown that part of the N-terminal domain shares functional and structural homology with the typical capsid protein. The SV gag is not processed like the orthoretrovieral gag; only a tiny 3kDa cut at the C-terminal is requried, and other cleavage sites are generally inefficient. The Metaviral (MV, Ty3/gypsy) gag, too, is known to have a structurally homologous capsid protein. Each capsid is assembled from 540 proteins. Unlike orthoretroviral CA proteins, it does not require dramatic maturation. The animal Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (ARC) gene is repurposed from the metaviral gag. This gene is responsible for transporting mRNA among neural cells, a key part of neuroplasticity. It has independently arose in Tetrapoda and Drosophila. Caulimoviridae members rarely get a gag assignment to its capsid-containing ORF, but the CP-PRO-POL layout does show analogy with the canonical gag-pol setup. Whether the parts stick together into a polyprotein depends on the genus.

For several years, the two flew around the country together, testing the young engineer's ideas and arguing constantly over the most trivial matters of airplane construction. In 1935, Odekirk co-designed the Hughes H-1 Racer. It set a world speed record of 352.39 miles per hour in September of that year, beating Raymond Delmotte's (of France) record of 314.32 miles per hour. The plane was revolutionary for its time and was one of the first planes in history to sport retractable landing gear and special countersunk screws and flat rivets to reduce wind resistance. Odekirk co-designed the H-4 Hercules (commonly known as the Spruce Goose) and many sources state that Odekirk was aboard when Hughes piloted the plane on its only flight on November 2, 1947. However, according to The Ouderkerk Family Saga: 350 Years in America,H. John Ouderkirk (ed.), The Ouderkerk Family Saga: 350 Years in America, Chapter: Glenn Odekirk & Howard Hughes, page 180 Glenn Odekirk was not on the Hercules. Odekirk recalled that day: \\"I dropped Hughes down on the dock and he said to me, 'Odie, you don't mind not being aboard while I taxi' \\"...and I said, \\"Oh, come on.\\" \\"The fellows back there (the Brewster committee) were giving him a bad time and told him the thing would never fly. So that is when I knew real well that he would take off if possible. I know darn well if it feels right, you are going to fly it. Mr. Hughes didn't want another pilot on board because someday someone would come out and say that Howard Hughes didn't fly it, so- and-so did.\\" Legacy In the Howard Hughes biopic The Aviator, Odekirk was portrayed by Matt Ross.

History and features The Bavarian family Wittelsbach owned the town until 1779. Eyewitness Travel Austria guide describes Sch√§rding's best feature is its central square, the north end of which sits the Silberzeile row of gabled-roof houses. Other features include the large Church of St. George. The castle is gone but in its gateway there is a local museum with religious sculptures and those by Johann Peter Schwanthaler.\\"Upper Austria: Sch√§rding,\\" Eyewitness Travel Austria (New York, New York: Dorling Kindersley Ltd., 2012), p. 197. Geography The town sits at an altitude of 313 meters in height in Innviertel. It measures 4.1 kilometers from north to south, 1.9 km from west to east. The total area is 4.08 km¬≤. 2.4 percent of the area is forested, 31.7 percent are used for agriculture. The Inn River forms the border with the neighboring German state of Bavaria. Directly opposite the town on the Bavarian side of the river is Neuhaus am Inn, which is accessible via two bridges. History The area around the current town has been inhabited since the Neolithic period. In 15 B.C., the Romans were advancing to the Danube and the Innviertel and Sch√§rding a part of the Roman province of Noricum was populated by Celts in the area. Around 488, King Odoacer withdrew its troops to the south. West Germanic Bavarians migrated about 30 years later up the Danube and occupied the area between the Vienna Woods and Lech. Place names ending in -ing, -ham and -heim clearly indicate the change of hands. The name of the district capital Scardinga came from the name given to the settlement by a man named Skardo and his family. As Passau farmyard scardinga Sch√§rding was first mentioned in records in 806 as a Passau farmyard. It has been the town center of the county of the Counts of Formbach-Neuburg since the 10th century. The castle rock in the immediate vicinity of the Inn River was utilized early as a favorable geographical location to plant an attachment. From 1160 it was ruled by the Counts of Andechs, from 1248 the Wittelsbach dynasty. Benefiting from its location by the Inn Sch√§rding became a center of trade, particularly for salt, timber, ores, wine, silk, glass, grain, textiles and livestock.the town was granted market rights at the end of the 13th century. After many changes of ownership in the 14th century, for example on 20 January 1316 (to the Wittelsbach), on September 24, 1364 it went to Rudolf IV of the House of Habsburg. 1369 ended the peace of Sch√§rding the dispute between Austria and Bavaria to the Tyrol, which fell to the Habsburgs who pawned the town back to Bavaria. From 1429 to 1436 the fortifications of the city were built by Duke Ludwig the Gebarteten. Among others, the outer castle gate, the moat, Linz and Passau Gate and the Water Gate were built during this time. During the Thirty Years' War, especially in the years 1628, 1634, 1645, 1647 and 1651, the plague raged in the city. During the War of the Austrian Succession, a Bavarian army was defeated near the town on 17 January, 1742, during a winter offensive led by the Austrian Field Marshall von Khevenh√ºller. In April 1939, when Mayor Hans Ominger, Kreisamtsleiter Johann Pachman and other National Socialists hosted a hunters' meeting at the Aschenbrenner Inn, a portrait of Hermann G√∂ring was decorated with fresh greens. The men celebrated the incorporation of the neighboring German-inhabited Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia into German hunting grounds.Anna Rosmus Hitlers Nibelungen, Samples Grafenau 2015, pp. 205f Population=Municipal structure The municipality comprises the following five localities (in parentheses population status as of October 31, 2011). * Allerheiligen (870) * Brunnwies (199) * Kreuzberg (236) * Inner city Sch√§rding (567) * Sch√§rding suburbs (3004) PopulationReligion The residents are predominantly Roman Catholic, at 83.5 percent of the entire town population.

Early life and education Born on November 9, 1926 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Bloom was the youngest child of Jewish parents. At the time of Bloom‚Äôs birth, his mother had been a recent convert to an Evangelical tradition of Christianity, and he was raised in that religious setting. After graduating from Germantown High School in 1944, he joined the United States Army. He was sent first to Virginia Military Institute and then Basic Training, after which he was assigned to the University of Pennsylvania for a nine-month program in Japanese language. In 1946, Bloom was deployed to Japan, serving in the Allied Translator and Interpreter Service. During this time, he promoted Evangelical Christianity and encountered the concept of Amida Buddha when a Christian minister explained a passage from the Christian scriptures by using Amida Buddha as an analogy. This sparked a lifelong interest that grew from curiosity to academic pursuit to personal faith, always through rigorous intellectual reflection and dialogue. Alfred Bloom died on August 25, 2017. Career Bloom began his academic life at Eastern Baptist Theological Seminary (BA., Th.B.) from 1947 to 1951. During this time he began to question, and then to abandon, the fundamentalist approach to the Bible which he had previously held. He completed his theological training at Andover Newton Theological School (B.D., S.T.M.) in Newton, Massachusetts in 1953. While in seminary, he was encouraged to pursue his intellectual interests in the newly founded degree of Comparative Religious Studies at Harvard Divinity School. He received a Fulbright grant to study in Japan (1957-1959) and was awarded his doctorate from Harvard Divinity School with his thesis \\"Shinran‚Äôs Gospel of Pure Grace\\" in 1963. From 1959 to 1961, Bloom was proctor for Center for the Study of World Religions, Harvard Divinity School, and Teaching Fellow in History of Religion, Harvard Divinity School. For a time, in 1961, he was lecturer in the History of Religion at Newton Junior College in Newton, Massachusetts. Bloom taught as a professor of Religion at the University of Oregon from 1961 to 1970, University of Hawaii at Manoa from 1970 to 1986, and the Institute of Buddhist Studies where he served as Dean from 1986 to 1994. Bloom became an active member of the Hawaii Betsuin in the 1970s and received Shin Buddhist ordination, Tokudo (1990) and Kaikyoshi (1994). He was given the posthumous title Ko-Toku-In Shaku Zen-Kyo. Bloom was instrumental in establishing the Hawaii Buddhist Study Center; founded the Futaba Memorial Lectures; and supported the founding of the Pacific Buddhist Academy. He received the Buddhist Promotion Society Award (1997), Living Treasures of Hawaii Award from the Honpa Hongwanji Mission of Hawaii (2002), and the 3rd Annual President's Award from the Institute of Buddhist Studies (2016).

The name is also written as Gag-v-Onc, with \\"v\\" indicating that the Onc sequence resides in a viral genome. Onc is a generic placeholder for a given specific oncogene, such as C-jun. (In the case of a fusion with C-jun, the resulting \\"gag-jun\\" protein is known alternatively as p65). Background Gag genes are part of a general architecture for retroviruses, viruses that replicate through reverse transcription, where the gag region of the genome encodes proteins that constitute the matrix, capsid and nucleocapsid of the mature virus particles. Like in HIV's replication cycle, these proteins are needed for viral budding from the host cell's plasma membrane, where the fully formed virions leave the cell to infect other cells.Principles of Virology, 3rd edition, Vol. 1, Molecular Biology, 2009 gag-v-onc The Gag-v-Onc fusion protein from the Rous sarcoma virus illustrates the dual role that the fusion protein plays in the viral and host cellular life cycle. For example, the viral gene Src (as in \\"sarcoma\\") is not necessary for viral reproduction, but does affect virulence. Due to evidence of conserved homology between the v-Src gene and its host (animal) genomes, and its non-essential status for viral reproduction, the v-Src gene is likely to have been acquired from a host genome and altered by subsequent mutations. These subsequent mutations are responsible for the oncogenic capabilities of the virus, as the normal (host) version of the Src gene, c-Src promotes survival, angiogenesis, proliferation and invasion pathways. These native pathways are disrupted in the presence of the mutant Src gene (v-Src) such that oncogenesis becomes more likely for the infected host cells, since the v-Src gene is translated into a functionally distinct version of its host counterpart. When a viral gene is introduced into the host cell and is sufficient to induce oncogenesis ‚Äì the creation of cancerous cells ‚Äì in the infected cell line, the gene is said to be a \\"viral transforming gene\\". When this type of gene is translated to a protein, the protein is called a \\"transforming protein\\". Note that since the viral oncogenes originated from a host genome, the transformation event is different from transduction, which describes the process of introducing non-native genes to a host organism via a viral infection. In the case of the murine leukemia viruses, a species of viruses capable of causing cancer in murines (mice), the viral life cycle can also be responsible for oncogenesis through a Gag-v-Onc fusion protein called \\"Mo-MuLV(src)\\", which is a Gag-v-Src protein capable of inducing oncogenesis in living mice.

Immigrants in the Lawrence mills Lawrence, Massachusetts was home to many textile mills which relied heavily upon immigrant labor. According to Carlson the strike was \\"a spontaneous revolt by immigrants who had arrived in Lawrence expecting a land of opportunity, but found instead a claustrophobic life of hard work and low pay.\\"Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, page 161. Carlson continues, > \\"It is obvious,\\" the State Bureau of Labor Statistics concluded in 1911, > \\"that the full-time earnings of a large number of adult employees are > entirely inadequate for a family.\\" Consequently, the average Lawrence family > sent mother, father, and all children over the legal minimum age of fourteen > to work. The dirty, crowded mills were breeding grounds for disease. > Tuberculosis and other respiratory ailments killed some 70 percent of the > city's mill workers. \\"A considerable number of the boys and girls die within > the first two or three years after beginning work,\\" wrote Dr. Elizabeth > Shapleigh, a Lawrence physician. \\"Thirty-six of every 100 of all men and > women who work in the mills die before or by the time they are 25 years of > age.\\" ... While the mill hands lived and died in poverty, their employers > thrived.Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, > 1983, page 161. The Industrial Workers of the World already had a significant presence in the Lawrence mills. Fred Thompson has written, > A persistent myth about the IWW is that it plunged into strikes without > previous organization, bringing out contented workers with spell-binding > oratory, won great victories, then deserted the workers to repeat the > process elsewhere. The myth is groundless... Prior to its fame at Lawrence > the IWW had been organizing textile workers for seven years, and these > constituted roughly half of its membership.The I.W.W.: Its First Seventy > Years, Fred W. Thompson & Patrick Murfin, 1976, page 56. The IWW's national organizers became involved when the Italian immigrant community in Lawrence sent a telegram to organizer Joseph Ettor.Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, William Dudley Haywood, 1929, page 246. Ettor was an Italian and, at age 27, already a veteran organizer for the IWW.Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, page 161. Haywood wrote in his autobiography that there were about twenty-eight different nationalities among the strikers, and they spoke forty-five different dialects.Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, William Dudley Haywood, 1929, page 247. (Thompson reported 16 \\"major\\" languages.)The I.W.W.: Its First Seventy Years, Fred W. Thompson & Patrick Murfin, 1976, page 59. Ettor and fellow organizer Arturo Giovannitti had successfully organized the strike by the time chief IWW organizer Bill Haywood arrived. Within a month of walking out of the mills, there were twenty-five thousand workers participating in the strike.Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, William Dudley Haywood, 1929, page 247. Haywood was sufficiently impressed that he thought it appropriate to leave the strike in the hands of his experienced organizers, and go on a speaking tour of northeastern U.S. cities in support of the strike.Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, page 165. The charges and the trial The death of Anna LoPizzo was used by the authorities during the Lawrence Strike as a means of disrupting and pressuring the union. Although union leaders Ettor and Giovannitti were two miles away at the time of her death, they were charged with her murder and imprisoned without bail until trial.Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, page 166. Bill Haywood cut short his tour, and returned to take control of the strike effort. The trial of Caruso, Ettor and Giovannitti was held on September 30, keeping the two capable and multi-lingual organizers out of action for eight months. At trial, Ettor and Giovannitti were locked in metal cages. The district attorney referred to them as \\"social vultures\\" and \\"labor buzzards.\\" Yet they were not accused of the murder for which they were arrested.Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, page 190. All three were acquitted. Significance of Anna LoPizzo's death Anna LoPizzo's death on the picket line had given the authorities a chance to remove the two main organizers from action for the duration of the strike, but it also became a rallying cry for the workers to demand justice. The March 10‚Äì17, 1999 issue of Metro Santa Cruz offers an example of how the strikers reacted. An excerpt: The strike was successful because the workers stayed united in their demands.Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, page 185. Business writers began to question employers' and the local authorities' tactics relating not only to the strike, but specifically relating to the handling of Anna LoPizzo's death. One writer concerned about the success of the IWW's organizing tactics was Arno Dosch, who wrote in the magazine The World's Work, > The efforts that have been made by employers and by governmental authorities > to repress the movement have been worse than useless. Every move that has > been made against the I. W. W. has had the effect of winning sympathy... The > trial of the three agitators, Mr. Ettor, Mr. Giovannitti, and Mr. Caruso, > for the murder of a woman whose death was indirectly due to the strike, was > a tactical error. Mr. Ettor won the support of millions of people when he > said, \\" I have been tried here not for my acts, but for my views.Arno Dosch, > \\"WHAT THE I.W.W. IS\\", The World's Work, vol. XXVI, no. 4 (August 1913), pp. > 406-420, accessed February 20, 2007 at > http://www.workerseducation.org/crutch/others/dosch.html Before the Lawrence Strike and the trial for the death of Anna LoPizzo, many businessmen categorically refused to recognize any unions. After the strike, the American Federation of Labor was courted by some employers, if only as a bulwark against the radical and militant Industrial Workers of the World. Carlson records, > Shortly after the Lawrence strike, John Golden, president of the AFL's > United Textile Workers union (a rival to the IWW's organizing efforts in > Lawrence), observed that frightened mill owners \\"are falling all over > themselves now to do business with our organization.\\" Lincoln Steffens > summed up the attitude of the panicky mill bosses. \\"Haywood makes Gompers > look like an angel,\\" he wrote. \\"The IWW makes the millmen sigh for the > AFL.\\"Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, > page 191. The foreboding on the part of employers resulted from their fears about what this new labor organization, the IWW, actually represented. Thompson quoted Harry Fosdick in the June issue of Outlook in 1912, > Wages have been raised, work has been resumed, the militia has gone, and the > whirring looms suggest industrial peace; but behind all this the most > revolutionary organization in the history of American industry is building > up an army of volunteers.

Some believed that the success of the strikers called for other measures. Fosdick quoted a Boston lawyer who stated, > The strike should have been stopped in the first twenty-four hours. The > militia should have been instructed to shoot. That is the way Napoleon did > it.Bread and Roses: The 1912 Lawrence textile Strike, By Joyce Kornbluh, > retrieved February 20, 2007.

History  The name, Maghdouch√©, originates from the Syriac word, which means \\"crop collectors.\\" It is also derived from the Syriac word Kidsh and its derivatives (Kadisho, Kadishat, Makdosho). In Hebrew, it means \\"holy\\" or \\"saintly.\\" According to Christian belief, when Jesus came to Sidon, the Virgin Mary who accompanied him, waited for him at the top of the hill where Maghdouch√© is located today. She spent the night in a cave that came to be known as Mantara, or the \\"Awaiting.\\" Emperor Constantine the Great responded to St. H√©l√®ne's request and transformed the cave into a sanctuary for the Virgin. He erected a tower in honor of the Virgin. The tower collapsed during the earthquake of 550. Later, King Louis IX erected a watching tower in the same location. The Mantara cave was once again discovered accidentally by a shepherd in 1726. An icon of the Virgin was also discovered, and it was of Byzantine style, dating back to the 7th or to the 8th century. Since then, the cave has been transformed into a place of pilgrimage for all the Lebanese confessions. In 1860, the Greek Catholic Church became the owner, and transformed the cave into a sanctuary in 1880. At the beginning of the sixties, under the auspices of Mgr Basile Khoury, the architect Varoujan Zaven designed and executed a hexagonal chapel topped by a 28-meter tower in a conical shape to support an 8.5-meter one-piece bronze statue of the Virgin Mary holding Jesus in her arms, of his own design as well, realized by Italian artist Pierrotti in Pietra Santa. The design and supervision of the project were both a donation on behalf of the architect. Our Lady of Mantara is considered the protectress of children, and many baptisms are celebrated at the sanctuary. Ernest Renan visited Maghdouch√© during his mission to Lebanon, (described in Mission de Ph√©nicie (1865-1874)) and he visited the caves Sayyidet el-Mantara and Mogharet el-Magdoura.Renan, 1864, pp. 518-519 In 1875 Victor Gu√©rin found it to be a village with 300 Greek Catholic inhabitants. He also noted the caves, Sa√Ødet el-Manthara and Merharet el-Makdoura.Gu√©rin, 1880, p. 486 On November 22nd 1986, the armed conflict between Amal (Shi'a Muslim militias) and the PLO (The Palestine Liberation Organization) spread to Maghdouch√©. Ferocious combats took place in this Christian strategic town. Ultimately, it fell partially in the hands of the Palestinians and its residents were forced to flee from their homes.

The series centers around a young extraterrestrial hero and the main player character called Kirby, who protects his home planet of Pop Star from various threats using his power to inhale and swallow enemies and gain their abilities. The series has sold over 20 million copies worldwide . Main characters=Kirby is a pink \\"puffball\\" and the protagonist of several games developed by HAL Laboratory. The villains he encounters typically threaten his home of on , most often the greedy King Dedede or the mysterious Meta Knight. The main games always have Kirby with the same basic abilities; he can walk, run, jump, float, and inhale and spit out or swallow his enemies. Following Kirby's Dream Land, Kirby can gain the abilities of the enemies he swallowed, such as Fire, Sword, Fighter, and Cutter. Kirby is voiced by Makiko Ohmoto. King Dedede is the archenemy of Kirby. He is a large penguin-like bird who serves as the monarch of Dream Land, carrying a large wooden mallet and is known to be self-centered; furthermore, Dedede causes many problems for the inhabitants of Dream Land through selfish mischief. Other times, his villainous acts are usually under the corrupting influences of other, more dangerous evils. Despite this, he is not truly evil, and has allied with Kirby several times to defeat a common enemy. Dedede has many of the same abilities as Kirby himself does, such as being able to inhale objects and spit them back out with tremendous force, and the ability to suck in air and fly. The \\"Revenge of the King\\" game of Kirby Super Star Ultra introduces a harder version of King Dedede known as , wearing a distinctive combat mask and wielding a giant mechanical hammer filled with multiple weapons. This version of Dedede returns in Kirby: Triple Deluxe after Dedede is brainwashed by the villain Taranza; and also appears as Dedede's Final Smash in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Meta Knight is an antihero character referred to as Kirby's rival, who sometimes fights with him for varying reasons, though they often arrive to the same goal. He always wears a grey-silver mask with only eye holes to see his two yellow glowing eyes, and under it, he looks almost exactly like Kirby, though with a blue body and white eyes, which appear yellow in Kirby: Planet Robobot and Kirby Star Allies. He wears a navy blue cloak that can transform into a set of wings, and he usually wields a special sword called the Galaxia Sword. Meta Knight is voiced by Atsushi Kisaichi in Japan, Eric Stuart in the English dub of the anime, and Eric Newsome in the English version of the Super Smash Bros. series. Bandana Waddle Dee , sometimes simply called , is a Waddle Dee who wears a blue bandana and is frequently seen wielding a spear. He first appeared in Kirby Super Star as the first opponent in the \\"Megaton Punch\\" minigame. In Kirby Super Star Ultra, he appears in the \\"Revenge of the King\\" game mode as King Dedede's right-hand man. Bandana Waddle Dee also appears in Kirby Super Star Ultras \\"The Arena\\" mode as a joke boss. Beginning with Kirby's Return to Dream Land, Bandana Waddle Dee transitioned into being an ally of Kirby and one of the game's four playable characters. He also assists Kirby in both Kirby: Triple Deluxe and Kirby: Planet Robobot by providing him with items, and again as a playable character in Kirby Star Allies. In the series spinoffs, Bandana Waddle Dee appears as a playable character in Kirby and the Rainbow Curse, and as a CPU-controlled ally in the single player mode of Kirby Battle Royale (using a parasol instead of a spear). It is implied that \\"The Apple Juice Song\\" (a special arrangement of the Apple Scramble theme from Kirby Battle Royale made for the 25th anniversary of the series) is sung by Bandana Waddle Dee in-universe. A rough translation of the song indicates that he is singing about getting stronger to be on par with Kirby in terms of power and skill (likely because of his defeat at his hands in \\"Revenge of the King,\\" or just out of admiration for him). Main antagonists=Nightmare , also known as Cloaked Nightmare, is the final boss of Kirby's Adventure and its remake, Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land. After Nightmare invades the miraculous Fountain of Dreams, King Dedede splits up the Star Rod into seven pieces and gives them to his friends, preventing Nightmare from spreading bad dreams. Kirby, not knowing this, finds the pieces and reunites them. Nightmare is inadvertently freed, but Kirby ends up using it to defeat him. is his initial form that shoots stars, and he eventually transforms into a humanoid, vampire-like being with a tornado-like cloak for a body known as . Nightmare is also the main villain of the Kirby: Right Back at Ya! anime. He runs NightMare Enterprises. He is given the name of eNeMeE in the English version. Depicted as having a more threatening persona than in the game, he is instead bent on conquering the universe, and dominates much of the universe from the series' beginning. He uses his ability to create an endless number of monsters to conquer civilizations. He also sells them to unsuspecting customers for a profit, via a transportation network. His only opposition are the Star Warriors and Galaxy Soldier Army, though they are wiped out before the series begins. He is an embodiment of life's fear and suffering, and so he strives to bring more pain to increase his power, and will always exist as long as people hold fear in their hearts. In the finale, he was destroyed by Kirby using the Star Rod. Nightmare is voiced by Banjo Ginga in the Japanese version of the anime and by Andrew Rannells in the English dub. Nightmare appears in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as an assist trophy, voiced by Hisao Egawa. An Another Dimension counterpart of Nightmare known as appears as the main antagonist in the game Super Kirby Clash. Parallel Nightmare is again voiced by Banjo Ginga. Dark Matter is a cloud-like creature commonly appearing as a black orb covered in orange petal-like extensions and possessing a single red eye. It has been depicted as both a character and a species, the latter of which is generally known in Japanese as „Äå„ÅÑ„Äç (meaning \\"black cloud\\"). It is a force of negative energy that lives a lonely existence, and initially attacked Pop Star out of jealousy for Dream Land's lifestyle, seeking to recreate it into a dark world where no one can be happy. Dark Matter can possess other beings, putting them under its control. Dark Matter makes its debut in Kirby's Dream Land 2 and possesses King Dedede. The Rainbow Drops extract it and reveal its form as a masked, robed being wielding a magical sword. After being defeated, it assumes its small orb form as it faces Kirby. In Kirby's Dream Land 3, a massive cloud of Dark Matter appears in the Pop Star sky and possesses many of its inhabitants. After aiding various creatures in need, Kirby eventually obtains the Love-Love Stick and enters the center of the cloud known as the Hyper Zone, and defeats Dark Matter once again. After its defeat, Kirby faces the leader of Dark Matter, a giant white creature with a single red eye known as . Dark Matter clouds return once more in Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards, where they invade Ripple Star for its Crystal. When the Crystal is shattered, Kirby sets out to reassemble the pieces on five other planets before confronting a Dark Matter creature called . Its defeat repels Dark Matter from Ripple Star, but the Crystal detects and expels a powerful presence of Dark Matter from the queen, which goes on to form a new planet. In the core of this last world is , presumably Zero's successor or a reincarnated version of it. It an angelic-looking form of Zero with a halo, a band-aid (confirming that Zero's eye shell from Dream Land 3 was a last-ditch effort and effectively hurt it in the process), segmented wings, and a green spiked tail. Dark Matter makes small cameo appearances in Kirby: Squeak Squad, Kirby Super Star Ultra and Kirby: Mass Attack. A clone of Dark Matter in its Kirby's Dream Land 2 form, dubbed or Dark Matter Blade, appears as an extra boss in Kirby: Planet Robobot. It was created from an unknown source by the supercomputer Star Dream; however, it is noted that Star Dream was unable to fully replicate Dark Matter's powers, as he is unable to turn into his second form. Marx is the final boss in Kirby Super Star and its remake. He is a round, lavender creature, similar to Kirby, but having no arms, wearing a jester hat, a bow tie, and brown shoes. He is frequently seen bouncing on a ball. In the beginning of the sixth and final chapter, \\"Milky Way Wishes\\", Marx tells Kirby about how the Sun and Moon are fighting and that only the power of a giant mechanical creature called Nova can make them stop, sending Kirby on the adventure. Once Nova appears, Marx suddenly pushes Kirby out of the way and wishes for control over Pop Star. Explaining that he was the one who started the fight between the Sun and Moon in the first place, Marx then turns into a more powerful form of himself, which has fangs and strange yellow wings, before sending Nova on a collision course with Pop Star. As the Sun and Moon hold Nova back, Kirby rides a magical shooting Starship into Nova and disables its heart, then defeats Marx and sends him crashing into Nova to destroy them both. In Kirby Super Star Ultra, pieces of Nova fuse with Marx's dead body and revives him as the more powerful , the final boss of the new and most difficult mode \\"The True Arena\\" with a new design and improved attacks. He makes a cameo appearance in Kirby: Squeak Squad, in an unlockable picture with other series villains. In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, an arrangement of the music when Kirby is battling Marx in Kirby Super Star can be played on the Halberd stage. The final boss from this game, Tabuu, also shares some similar moves and pattern with Marx (both of them created by Masahiro Sakurai) In Kirby: Mass Attack, he appears as the big boss of the \\"Kirby Brawlball\\" sub- game. In Kirby's Return to Dream Land, he makes a brief appearance in the crowd of the final Kirby Master 100% video, and if Kirby uses the Stone ability in Kirby's Return to Dream Land, he will occasionally turn into a stone statue of Marx in his original form bouncing on his striped ball. He also appears in Kirby Star Allies as a playable Dream Friend, added through update 2.0.0. He makes an appearance of the Kirby representative of the boss fights in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, through Kirby's, the Inkling's, and Rosalina and Luma's Classic Modes and also appears in World of Light. Dark Mind is the main villain of Kirby & the Amazing Mirror, with Dark Meta Knight as his right-hand man. At the intro of the game, after Meta Knight rushes into the mirror world, Dark Meta Knight slices Kirby into four, unintentionally giving Kirby backup against the corrupted Mirror World. Throughout the game, Dark Meta Knight masquerades as the real deal and a timid \\"Shadow Kirby\\" also makes its appearance. Towards the end of the game, the original Meta Knight exposes the copy during the final confrontation. After Dark Meta Knight is shattered, the way to Dark Mind is open and sucks Kirby and Meta Knight's Master Sword. After Dark Mind is defeated, it is learned that he intended to make the Mirror World be overrun with a person's worst reflection of themselves; Shadow Kirby is actually an honest reflection of the real Kirby with no such qualities, and stays behind as the guardian of the Mirror World as Meta Knight lays his Master Sword to rest. In Team Kirby Clash Deluxe and Super Kirby Clash, Dark Mind assumes the form of King Dedede as the game's final boss, named . Although he is the final boss in Team Kirby Clash Deluxe, he is also in Super Kirby Clash. Dark Meta Knight is also a playable Dream Friend in Kirby Star Allies update 3.0.0. Drawcia is the villain of Kirby: Canvas Curse. She is an evil paint-witch and a dangerous sorceress. She curses Kirby into a ball at the start of the game and turns Pop Star into paint. She has two forms: Drawcia Sorceress and Drawcia Soul. Her first, humanoid form, can shoot balls of energy at Kirby and summon enemies to damage him. Her second form resembles a blob of paint, and she has many paint-related techniques. When she is defeated, her curse is lifted and Pop Star and Kirby return to normal. Dark Nebula is the prisoner of a treasure chest which was originally in King Dedede's possession in Kirby: Squeak Squad. Meta Knight realizes what is truly inside the treasure chest and suddenly steals it to prevent his release. Kirby, thinking his cake is inside, chases him to the ruins of the Halberd under the Secret Sea. Aboard the operational Halberd, the leader of the Squeaks, Daroach, manages to open the chest and releases him. However, Dark Nebula takes over his body and escapes to Gamble Galaxy. Kirby eventually fights Daroach again and Dark Nebula is forced out. Daroach relinquishes the Triple Star, a mystical rod. With his help, Dark Nebula is banished. Dark Nebula has two cameos in the base version of Kirby Star Allies, where he appears as a transformation of the Stone ability, and as a Jack-in- the-box in one of Daroach's attacks; in the 4.0.0 update, it also appears in the \\"\\"Bad Boss Brothers\\", where it is shown opposite 0¬≤ and Zero among other final bosses. Yin-Yarn the Sorcerer is the main villain of Kirby's Epic Yarn and the remake, Kirby's Extra Epic Yarn. He is an evil sorcerer who wreaks chaos and havoc in Dream Land and Patch Land. When Kirby tries to eat his Metatomato (thinking it's a Maxim Tomato), Yin-Yarn traps Kirby inside a sock that sends him to Patch Land, where Kirby's body transforms into yarn. A bit later, Kirby realizes that air goes through yarn, which forces him to use the yarn whip and transformations with yarn instead of his normal inhalation- based power. Later, Kirby learns about Yin-Yarn tearing Patch Land into seven pieces and stealing the magic yarn. In the game, Kirby must retrieve the magic yarn by defeating a boss. Yin-Yarn, after tearing Patch Land into seven pieces, he travels to Dream Land to wreak havoc there. So, to save both of their worlds, Kirby and Prince Fluff set off to recover seven pieces of yarn, defeat Yin-Yarn, and bring peace back to both Dream Land and Patch Land. Yin- Yarn is the boss of Dream Land and is fought in two forms: first, he attacks Kirby and Prince Fluff in his normal form. Secondly, he attacks them as Mega Yin-Yarn, leaving Kirby and Prince Fluff hopeless. Suddenly, Meta Knight flies by, dropping a Tankbot Metamortex, turning them into a Tankbot to fight and defeat this evil incarnation. Yin-Yarn's name is a pun on yin yang. Yin Yarn, like all of Patch Land's creatures, is made from yarn (considering the name, Yin-Yarn), and a button for a nose. He uses knitting needles for his evil schemes (which are mostly creating giant monsters and fake Waddle Dees to beat up King Dedede). Necrodeus is the primary antagonist of Kirby Mass Attack. He is the leader of a group of demons known as the Skull Gang. Upon appearing at the beginning of the game, Necrodeus casts a spell that splits Kirby into ten pieces and defeats all but one Kirby. Necrodeus has the ultimate goal of shrouding Popstar in darkness, but is defeated by Kirby in the final scenes. His name means \\"Deathgod\\" in Latin, a name that accurately describes his appearance and nature. As the final boss of Kirby Mass Attack, he faces Kirby in two forms: first, Kirby must defeat his hands (similar to the Wham Bam Rock fight from Kirby Super Star), next, Kirby must defeat him. Upon death, Necrodeus drops his magic staff, the source of his power, which Kirby uses to restore himself to normal. Magolor appears in Kirby's Return to Dream Land, initially as a friendly character. He travels to Dream Land on an inter-dimensional ship called the Lor Starcutter. When the ship crash lands in Dream Land, Kirby, King Dedede, Meta Knight, and Bandana Waddle Dee offer to help repair the Lor Starcutter so that he can return to a realm known as Halcandra - and as a reward for their efforts, Magolor brings Kirby and the group to Halcandra for a visit. When the group arrives, a large four- headed dragon known as Landia attacks and shoots down the Lor Starcutter for an unknown reason. Angry that they have been trapped, Magolor sends Kirby and the group to defeat Landia. In truth, Magolor is a power-hungry villain who is secretly using the four to defeat Landia for him, so that he could obtain the Master Crown. The Master Crown grants limitless power to the wearer, and Landia is currently in possession of this crown. Magolor wishes to become the universe's ruling overlord, but he must gain the power to do so from the Master Crown. It is revealed that Magolor had fought and lost to Landia before, and in his escape attempt, he landed in Dream Land. After Landia is defeated by Kirby and the group, Magolor puts on the Master Crown and transforms into a giant floating entity with enormous power, then announces that he will start his plan by conquering Planet Popstar as his \\"reward\\" to Kirby and his friends for their help. With help from Landia, Kirby chases Magolor into another dimension and sinks the Lor Starcutter, then battles Magolor himself. After his first defeat, Magolor is seemed to been destroyed. But, during a cutscene, it's revealed that the Master Crown took control of Magolor's body, and turned himself into Magolor Soul. After the second defeat, the crown is broken, and Magolor is taken into a portal, seeming to end his tyranny. Magolor returns in Kirby's Dream Collection, revealed to be alive and reformed, where he builds Kirby a new playground as an apology for his actions in Kirby's Return to Dream Land. Here, Kirby can play through new challenge stages, some of which he races against Magolor. During the races, he uses magic to summon enemies, as well as attack Kirby. His rivalry with Kirby still exists, albeit more friendly. After his appearance in Kirby's Return to Dream Land, Magolor also has made cameo appearances in other games, including Kirby: Triple Deluxe (as an 8 bit keychain), Dedede's Drum Dash Deluxe (as an enemy, although he doesn't deal damage), Super Smash Bros. for Wii U (as a trophy), Kirby: Planet Robobot (as a sticker), and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (as a spirit). He appears as a playable character in the third update for Kirby Star Allies. Queen Sectonia is the main villain of Kirby: Triple Deluxe. She claims to be the ruler of the heavens, calling Dream Land the \\"lower world\\". Sectonia ruled over her land, Floralia, with an iron fist, resulting in the people of the sky to send out the Dreamstalk, which they hope would bring Kirby to their rescue. However, Queen Sectonia sent her trusted servant, Taranza, to intercept this plan by kidnapping the Hero of Dream Land. Taranza accidentally mistakes King Dedede for Kirby and kidnaps him. Kirby then pursues Taranza in an effort to rescue Dedede. Finally, Kirby corners Taranza in Royal Road, Queen Sectonia's palace. After defeating a possessed King Dedede, Taranza calls forth Queen Sectonia in an effort to save himself, but Queen Sectonia instead shoots him, calling him a \\"pitiful fool.\\" Kirby and Queen Sectonia do battle, with Kirby reigning victorious. In a last ditch effort, the queen fuses herself with the Dreamstalk, with the intent of warping Popstar into her perfect vision. Kirby once again battles Sectonia, but ends up being captured. As the queen begins to strangle Kirby, Taranza returns with King Dedede. King Dedede frees Kirby, while Taranza gives Kirby a Miracle Fruit, allowing Kirby to become Hypernova Kirby. Kirby then inhales Queen Sectonia's laser blast before spitting it back at her, destroying her. In the extra mode Dededetour, she returns as and is fought by King Dedede. She later returns in \\"The True Arena\\" where she consumes four Miracle Fruits turning her into and once again battles Kirby. After her defeat, however, she rips herself out of the Dreamstalk to battle Kirby one last time. After her defeat, she bursts into a shower of flower petals. One petal, which glowed larger than the others, fell slowly, giving note of the usage of how Star Dream was able to clone her. A clone of Sectonia appears in Kirby: Planet Robobot as an extra boss, created by Star Dream using a sample from Sectonia's flower form. It is more zombie-like in appearance than the original Sectonia, and upon defeat briefly shrinks down into a spider-like form similar to Taranza (possibly Sectonia's original form) before dying. Dark Crafter is the main antagonist of Kirby and the Rainbow Curse. He is a multicolored cloud-like creature with the strange urge to steal color from places, and possessed Claycia to fulfill these plans. But after Claycia was freed from his control, Dark Crafter became furious and decided to steal the colors himself. With help from Claycia, Kirby and Elline destroyed Dark Crafter causing him to explode. President Haltmann , full name , is an antagonist in Kirby: Planet Robobot. As the President of Haltmann Works Company (HWC), Haltmann cares only about the prosperity of his company. To this end, he travels the galaxy in his giant spaceship, the Access Ark, and terraforms planets by stripping away their resources and converting them to giant mechanical fortresses. The plight of the natives do not interest Haltmann, whom he cruelly dismisses as \\"savages\\". At the end of the game, Kirby confronts Haltmann, who fights him in a custom-built Robobot Armor made of solid gold. After his defeat, Haltmann summons the Mother Computer, Star Dream, in his attempt to destroy Kirby, but Susie interrupts and tries to steal Star Dream. This backfires when Star Dream wakes up and uploads itself into Haltmann, possessing him and driving Star Dream to grant his wish of eternal prosperity for HWC by erasing everything else in existence. In \\"The True Arena\\", Star Dream's control over Haltmann becomes even stronger when Kirby fights its Core OS, erasing every last trace of Haltmann from its programming as Kirby disables and eventually destroys the rampaging computer. In the \\"Meta Knightmare Returns\\" mode, he is faced by Meta Knight under the name , once defeated, Star Dream awakens and tests Meta Knight who it acknowledges as the new admin. Pause screen descriptions in \\"Meta Knightmare Returns\\" and \\"The True Arena\\" shed additional light on Haltmann's backstory. He originally built Star Dream from ancient technology and knowledge gained from an unknown source. During an experiment with it, President Haltmann's daughter Susanna disappeared. The belief that Susanna was dead drove Haltmann insane, and he continued constructing Star Dream to grant his wish of eternal prosperity for his company. This required significant amounts of natural resources, which eventually led HWC to Popstar. Star Dream A supercomputer built by the Haltmann Works Company (HWC), is the true main villain and final boss of Kirby: Planet Robobot. President Haltmann constructed it using ancient technology and knowledge from an unknown source. Much later, when Haltmann has been defeated by Kirby, the computer wakes up and consumes Haltmann's mind to become self-aware. Speaking through Haltmann's body, Star Dream reveals that it used the HWC and its business plan to study organic life throughout the universe. Having arrived at the conclusion that all organic life is an obstacle to prosperity and thus must be destroyed, Star Dream flies off into space and is pursued by Kirby, who has fused the Robobot Armor with the Halberd. After taking heavy damage in the ensuing dogfight, Star Dream connects itself to the HWC's mothership, the Access Ark, to continue fighting. Once the armored shell of the Access Ark is broken off, the true form of Star Dream is revealed - a clockwork star nearly identical to Nova, the comet used by Marx in Kirby Super Star. In a last attempt, Kirby manages to drill completely through Star Dream, presumably destroying it. In the \\"Meta Knightmare Returns\\" mode, Star Dream requests that Meta Knight prove himself to it after Haltmann is defeated. For this purpose, it creates clones of Dark Matter and Sectonia. After these fail, it summons Galacta Knight through a space-time portal, but Galacta Knight destroys it himself before doing battle with Meta Knight. In \\"The True Arena\\", the damage done by Galacta Knight ends up activating a hidden program within the computer transforming it into the more powerful who is fought as the final opponent of \\"The True Arena\\". Upon the defeat of its clockwork star form, however, the mechanical monstrosity pulls Kirby into itself. Inside, the true form of Star Dream Soul OS is revealed as an armored, mechanical heart like that of Nova. After being defeated, the heart makes one final attempt to destroy Kirby by firing immense waves of energy before finally exploding. Hyness is an antagonist in Kirby Star Allies. He is the leader of a mysterious cult that worships Void, and the commander of the three Mage-Sisters: Francisca, Flamberge, and Zan Partizanne. Once a kind individual who saved the Mage-Sisters from death and granted them their elemental powers, he was eventually driven to insanity and grew neglectful towards the Mage-Sisters despite their loyalty to him. This is particularly tragic in the case of Zan Partizanne, who adores him despite his inability to even remember her name. His goal is to obtain the pieces of the Jamba Heart scattered throughout the galaxy and use them to resurrect Void Termina, who he refers to as his \\"Dark Lord.\\" Kirby and his allies battle Hyness's forces every step of the way and eventually reach him at the altar within the Divine Terminus, where he has assembled the nearly complete Jamba Heart. To buy Hyness time, Zan Partizanne fights Kirby again but is beaten. Hyness then takes notice of the intruders, shoves Zan Partizanne aside and battles them himself, utilizing his dark magic in combat. When beaten, his cloak falls off, revealing his grotesque true appearance as a purple and yellow-skinned creature with a huge nose and ears and bulging eyes. Hyness flies into a state of madness and summons the three Mage-Sisters, then places them under his control and uses them as zombified puppets to battle his enemies. Even this fails to defeat Kirby, however, and Hyness is left greatly weakened. Desperate to fulfill his goal and resurrect Void Termina, Hyness sacrifices himself and the Mage-Sisters to the Jamba Heart, giving the Dark Lord the energy it needs to awaken. All four are later seen trapped in fleshy cocoons within Void Termina's body, but are ejected during Kirby's battle with the creature. In the \\"Heroes in Another Dimension\\" storyline, it is revealed that Hyness's prayers to summon Void Termina have caused time and space to break down at the Divine Terminus, and he has vanished into the titular alternate dimension. Once Kirby and his friends gather the four spears that once sealed the Jamba Heart, they find a new Jamba Heart at the alternate dimension's Divine Terminus. The spears cause the heart to shatter, releasing Hyness in a demonic new form dubbed . In this form, Hyness's magic is much more powerful at the cost of destroying his already fragile mental state. Kirby's group ultimately manages to defeat him, only for the three Mage- Sisters to arrive too late to help him. In the storyline's good ending, the Mage-Sisters are saved by the power of Kirby's Friend Heart, and after Kirby leaves, Hyness turns back into his true self, allowing the Mage-Sisters to help him up and bring him back to their world. Void Termina , also known as the \\"Destroyer of Worlds,\\" is the final boss of Kirby Star Allies. It is an ancient being that has been reincarnated throughout the ages, and is worshipped by Hyness's cult. Long ago, Void Termina was sealed away by four warriors who used mystical spears that Hyness removed from the Jamba Heart at the beginning of the game's story. Because of an imperfection in the ritual, pieces of the Jamba Heart scatter throughout space, including on Popstar, where they possess Whispy Woods, King Dedede and Meta Knight. At Hyness's behest, the three Mage-Sisters search through space to recover the Jamba Heart pieces so Void Termina can be revived. Once Hyness sacrifices himself and the Mage-Sisters to the Jamba Heart, the seal is fully broken and Void Termina reawakens. Initially assuming a giant humanoid form, Void Termina battles Kirby and his allies in deep space. In this form, Void Termina can create massive shockwaves and wield giant swords that it can charge with elemental energy. To damage Void Termina, Kirby must use the Star Allies Sparkler to shoot an eye on Void Termina's body. Once the beast suffers enough damage, it collapses and its mask falls off, pulling the heroes into its body and forcing them to battle its core. Eventually, the core splits open, and Kirby and his allies are ejected from Void Termina's body. Void Termina rises again, sprouts giant wings, and becomes able to summon and use a variety of magical weapons. Like before, the eye that appears on its body is a weak spot, and after taking heavy damage it falls to the ground and pulls Kirby into itself again. This time, Void Termina's true form appears inside its body - an amorphous mass capable of taking on a number of forms and taking control of Kirby's allies, which can only be undone using a Friend Heart. At the end of the battle, Void Termina is finally destroyed in a clash between the Star Allies Sparkler and its Dark Matter form's laser. In the Soul Melter difficulty of the Ultimate Choice sub-game, Void Termina's true form is dubbed . It is noted that the ancient scrolls written about Void Termina say that its reincarnations may be affected by positive or negative energy, leaving the possibility that Void Termina may one day return as a friend instead of an enemy. In Soul Melter EX, Void Termina's appearance changes once again, with its body turning black, its mask bearing glowing red eyes, and its innards becoming a color-shifting abyss. This form's full name is Void Termina, the True Destroyer of Worlds and its abilities are accordingly dramatically enhanced. In the final phase, a new entity simply named awakens inside its body. Nicknamed the Astral Birth, it fights with all the powers of Void Soul but also incorporates techniques used by Dark Mind and Drawcia Soul. Supporting characters=Adeleine is a human girl artist who came to Pop Star to study art. In Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards, she appeared as one of the early boss characters taken over by Dark Matter. She is taken over and fights Kirby, and later joins with Kirby after he frees her. She has the ability to make her paintings real, either creating monsters while under the control of Dark Matter or providing Kirby with help. A nearly identical character named plays a similar role in Kirby's Dream Land 3. Some official sources suggest that Ado may simply be a nickname of Adeleine, but it has yet to be completely confirmed. Adeleine appears as a playable Dream Friend in Kirby Star Allies, with Ribbon supporting her. Dyna Blade is an enormous armored bird that acts as both a friend and a foe in Kirby Super Star, and Kirby Super Star Ultra. In her self-titled game, she destroys all of Dream Land's crops to feed her chicks. Kirby defeats her, not knowing this, so he ends up feeding the chicks with apples and teaching them how to fly. In \\"Revenge of Meta Knight\\", Dyna Blade returns the favor by successfully carrying Kirby onto the Halberd before the artillery forces her to retreat. In Kirby: Right Back at Ya!, Dyna Blade is shown as a legendary bird that is worshiped by the citizens of Cappytown. King Dedede hatches a plot to get rid of Kirby by tricking him into eating her egg, which infuriates Dyna Blade and causes her to chase and attack Kirby for much of the episode, until her chick appears and Kirby feeds it, placating Dyna. In Kirby Air Ride, Dyna Blade appears in City Trial mode and sometimes flies to different parts of the city until flying away all together. The player can defeat Dyna Blade by aiming for her head to obtain multiple power ups. In Kirby's Epic Yarn, a similar boss to Dyna Blade named Hot Wings appears as the boss of Hot Land. Dyna Blade's most recent appearance has been in Kirby Star Allies, making a cameo in Dream Land's overworld map Gooey is a blue blob with a pair of eyes and a mouth. He first appears in Kirby's Dream Land 2 as a friend of Kirby that can be rescued from a holding bag (if Kirby is already with the animal partner that's inside it). Rescuing him at least once awards a single percentage point for 100% completion. There is also a female blob similar to Gooey that must also be rescued for 100%, though she appears more rarely. Kirby's Dream Land 3 expands on Gooey's character. He is revealed to be of the Dark Matter race, but chose to be Kirby's friend instead. He can be summoned by Kirby as a helper character similar to those in Kirby Super Star, controlled by either the computer or a second player. Gooey's main form of offense is to snag enemies with his tongue and spit them out like Kirby does; he cannot capture multiple enemies like Kirby can, but can use his tongue underwater. Gooey can also copy abilities like Kirby, but only when a second player is controlling him. When flying in the Hyper Zone, Gooey assumes his Dark Matter form, though he still maintains his own face. He also appears in Kirby Star Allies as a playable character through an update. Keeby is a yellow-colored Kirby whose Japanese name only officially appears in Kirby's Dream Course supplemental material. Only playable through multiplayer mode, Keeby is Kirby's rival to see who can get the most points in a race to get to the golf hole first. Keeby also appears as an optional costume for Kirby in the Super Smash Bros. series. Kirby turns the color of Keeby when he obtains the Beam ability in Kirby Super Star. In Kirby: Squeak Squad, Kirby can use spray paint to become a yellow Kirby. Animal Friends Kirby's Dream Land 2 and Kirby's Dream Land 3 feature various allies that can team up with Kirby and share powers. Kirby's Dream Land 2 introduces: * - A brown and white hamster who can walk on ice without slipping. In Kirby's Dream Land 3, Rick can also defeat enemies by jumping on them and climb walls, but he is the only animal partner who cannot inhale and must walk into enemies with his mouth open to eat them. * - A wise purple owl who can fly against strong winds. * - A blue fish who can swim against strong currents and allow Kirby to use his inhaling attack underwater. He can also travel on land, albeit very slowly, and in Kirby's Dream Land 3 can jump on foes to defeat them. Kirby's Dream Land 3 introduces: * - A brown, orange, and white cat that is twice the size of Kirby. He can roll Kirby up into a ball and roll him around, and can also perform double or triple-jumps and jump on foes to defeat them. * - A small green bird who can perform powerful attacks when he has a Copy Ability. He can fly too, but not against strong winds. * - A pink octopus who can cling to ceilings, but also weighs Kirby down when he attempts to fly. In Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards, when Kirby uses the Cutter/Stone Power Combo, he can randomly carve himself into a stone statue of his allies. Rick, Coo, and Kine also appear in the anime series Kirby: Right Back at Ya!, and appear in Kirby's Return to Dream Land as one of Stone Kirby's transformations. Rick, Coo, and Kine make a cameo in Kirby Mass Attack, as the background image in the minigame \\"Kirby Quest\\". They also appear in the Kirby Fighters mode of Kirby: Triple Deluxe, appearing in Coo's Forest stage where they randomly appear and attack players indiscriminately. In Kirby Star Allies, Rick, Coo, and Kine are a composite playable Dream Friend, while Nago, Pitch, and ChuChu appear in various attacks when Kirby uses the Cleaning ability. Prince Fluff is a playable character who helps Kirby in Kirby's Epic Yarn and its 3DS remake. He is similar in appearance to Kirby, but is blue in color, has brown eyes, and wears a small golden crown. He and Kirby team up to recover seven pieces of magic yarn scattered throughout the land, defeat Yin-Yarn, and bring peace back to his home, Patch Land. Ribbon is a pink-haired fairy from the planet Ripple Star who appears in Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards. She is a kind and brave character who attempted to escape her planet with the fairies' magical Crystal when it was invaded by Dark Matter.Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards instruction booklet, pgs. 4-6 (PDF) In space, Dark Matter blobs ambushed her, shattered the crystal, and made her fall to Pop Star, where she lands on a stargazing Kirby and pleads with him for help. Kirby agrees and they search for the Crystal shards scattered on various planets and thwart Dark Matter's invasion of Ripple Star along with Waddle Dee, Adeleine, and King Dedede. In the final battle, Ribbon and the crystal aid Kirby in defeating 0¬≤, the controlling force behind Dark Matter. In the ending cutscene of the game, she gives Kirby a kiss, blushing shyly afterward. She later makes a cameo in Kirby: Planet Robobot as a sticker and later appears in Kirby Star Allies as Adeleine's partner in an update. Landia is a four-headed dragon from Kirby's Return to Dream Land. According to the in-game description, he has protected the Master Crown and the Lor Starcutter since ancient times. Magolor attempted to steal the treasures he guarded, thus waking him up and forcing him into a rampage. Magolor fought against Landia himself to get it but lost, so he stole the Lor Starcutter and flew to Planet Popstar in hopes of finding someone useful to his plans. Magolor returned with Kirby, King Dedede, Meta Knight and Bandana Waddle Dee, and sicced all four on the dragon. After they defeated him, Magolor finally obtained the Master Crown and left to take over the galaxy starting with Popstar. Landia, as four smaller dragons, helped Kirby and company in their efforts to defeat Magolor. After Magolor's defeat, Landia and the Lor Starcutter help Kirby and the others escape from the closing void back to Popstar before returning home to Halcandra. He is also the one-to-final boss in the sub-game \\"Team Kirby Clash\\" in Planet Robobot, and his EX form, which is colored purple, is the final boss in the same game. He is also fought in the expanded standalone version of the sub-game, Team Kirby Clash Deluxe in the Empyrean, as well as his EX counterpart in the Decisive Battlefield. A parallel version of Landia also appears where Landia EX is fought, and the game confirms Landia's gender to be male. Taranza is a spider-like creature who appears in Kirby: Triple Deluxe. He hails from Floralia and is a retainer to Queen Sectonia. He was sent by Queen Sectonia to kidnap Kirby but kidnaps King Dedede instead. Kirby then chases him up the Dreamstalk all the way to Royal Road, where he uses his hypnotic abilities to put King Dedede under his control. After Masked Dedede is defeated, he entreats Queen Sectonia to save him, but she does not: instead, she strikes him with a laser beam attack, prompting Taranza to switch allegiances after this betrayal. It is hinted in the in-game descriptions that Taranza used to be friends with Queen Sectonia but recently noticed some disturbing changes in her demeanor. In Team Kirby Clash Deluxe, Taranza is the main villain responsible for driving the inhabitants of the Dream Kingdom into disturbing the peace. After Kirby and his allies defeat him, he uses a magical mirror to summon dangerous monsters from another dimension. However, the game's ending reveals that the mirror was controlling Taranza the entire time, and he returns to being peaceful after it is destroyed. He is a playable character in the third update for Kirby Star Allies. Elline is a paintbrush-like fairy who appears in Kirby and the Rainbow Curse. She helps Kirby to defeat Claycia by freeing her from her curse. When Claycia came to her senses, she reconciled with Elline. However, their reunion is cut short by a furious Dark Crafter who lost control over Claycia and plans to steal the colors himself, Claycia helps Kirby and Elline defeat Dark Crafter and restore Planet Popstar. Susie appears in Kirby: Planet Robobot as the executive secretary of Haltmann Works Company. She is placed in charge of the project to take over Planet Popstar and convert it to a fully mechanized HWC planet. Kirby confronts Susie at several points, initially as a boss who fights in a custom-built Robobot Armor, and later to summon Meta Knight and King Dedede, both having been captured and experimented on during the invasion and turned into servants of HWC. In the final level, Access Ark, President Haltmann fires Susie for her repeated failures. After Kirby and Haltmann fight, Susie suddenly reveals that she's a corporate spy and attempts to steal Star Dream with the intent to sell it to the highest bidder, but Star Dream wakes up during the scuffle and begins its rampage. Susie gives Kirby a Robobot Armor and begs him to stop Star Dream, after which she escapes to unknown whereabouts. In the \\"Meta Knightmare Returns\\" mode, new information about Susie and her relationship with Haltmann is revealed via the Pause screen. Her full name is . She is implied to be President Haltmann's daughter who vanished during an experiment with Star Dream to open portals into other dimensions, only to somehow return and begin working for HWC.

He is voiced by Takeshi Nagasako in the Japanese version and by Maddie Blaustein in the English dub. Samo is a Cappy who is the owner and bartender of a juice bar in Cappy Town. Upon hearing the problems of the Cappies that visit his bar, Samo would relay them to Mabel. He was one of the few who knew she wasn't a true psychic, not that he minded. They both care about each other, though Samo tends to get a bit sappy. He is voiced by Nobuo Tobita in the Japanese version and by Mike Pollock in the English dub. Sirica is a pale and white alien girl who is the daughter of the legendary Star Warrior Garlude, a mother who teamed up with Meta Knight to reclaim Galaxia and was killed by a monster called Kirisakin. Sirica wields a weapon that can change into five different modes (a flamethrower, a grappling hook, bazooka, a machine gun and a sword). In the episode \\"Crusade for the Blade\\", she attacked Meta Knight and tried to seize his sword. She believed that he stole it and left her mother to be killed by the hands of Kirisakin, but was eventually proven wrong when she learned the truth from the sword. In the end, she helped Kirby to destroy Kirisakin, to avenge her mother's death and therefore becoming friends with him and the others. She later returned in the final episode, she is among the other characters as they help Kirby and his friends battle Nightmare. She is voiced by Tomoe Hanba in the Japanese version and by Veronica Taylor in the English dub. Spikehead is a Cappy Kid who is one of Tuff's friends and the pushiest amongst the three. Spikehead has a crush on Honey. He is voiced by Chiro Kanzaki in the Japanese version and by Amy Birnbaum in the English dub. Many fans of the anime often confuse Spikehead as a female because of his voice. Tokkori is a selfish bird that basically uses Kirby for protection purposes. His first appearance in the anime was the very beginning of the first episode as a cameo, sleeping. In A Blockbuster Battle, when a storm came and Kirby needed to find shelter, he accidentally took Tokkori's nest. When Kirby needed a job, King Dedede told Tokkori to sabotage Kirby's attempts to find work. At the end, Tiff and Tuff built a little house for Kirby. In the third episode, Tuff finds that Tokkori took Kirby's house. Now, he rarely lets Kirby sleep in the house or just lets him in for some rest while he watches Channel DDD. However, he has shown kindness towards Kirby, even if it's in a superficial way. In \\"Buccaneer Birdy\\", Tokkori was once believed to be a descendant of a royal bird called Lord James Coleet that belonged to an old pirate named Captain Kick. However, this was revealed to not be the case, but Tiff altered the picture upon discovering the truth so that the Cappies still thought it was true. Nevertheless, Tokkori refused to be seen as royalty anymore, once again preferring to have things to complain about. He is voiced by Fujiko Takimoto in the Japanese version and by Kevin Kolack in the English dub. Tuggle is a Cappy who is the shopkeeper of Cappy Town's grocery store which is one of a few places to get a steady flow of business. Tuggle would sometimes be see seen with Gengu. He wears a green hat and apron with two sun symbols in the bottom. He is voiced by Mizuki Saitoh in the Japanese version and by Eric Stuart in the English dub. Yabui is a Cappy who is the only doctor in Cappy Town where he is also a dentist. He runs a small, low tech clinic, but doesn't get many bad cases aside from colds, toothaches, and the occasional case of sleeping sickness. Many of the Cappies don't like visiting Yabui as he has many painful strategies of fighting cavities. His eyes and mouth were hidden by his glasses and a light grey mustache respectively. Unlike the other cappies, Yabui is the only one who has hands. He is voiced by Sekine Kazunori in the Japanese version and by David Lapkin in the English dub. NightMare Enterprises , commonly N.M.E., is an organization led by Nightmare. Its purpose is creating monsters selling them to unsuspecting customers through the internet in order to spread Nightmare's empire. Besides the monsters and by-products, NightMare Enterprises also creates different kinds of warfare, ranging from laser guns to large ships. The company is housed by a massive spaceship with an eye on its front and cyberspace cities on its exterior. =N.M.E. Sales Guy= The is the company's main employee who sells monsters to King Dedede over the Internet. In the Japanese version, he speaks politely, but still doesn't pass up a chance to insult customers. However, in the dub, his personality is more like that of a stereotypical used car salesman. The Sales Guy answers to Nightmare and often tends to overcharge King Dedede for his purchases. In \\"New Year! Kirby Quiz Show\\" (\\"The Kirby Quiz\\" in the dub), he hosts a quiz show to welcome the new year with questions about the series. Until the final episode, only the top half of his body is shown, giving King Dedede and Escargoon the illusion of him being a tall human. In the finale, he is revealed to be very short with tiny Kirby-like feet below his waist. When Dedede and Escargoon meet him in person, they decide to get revenge on the Sales Guy for all the trouble he gave them by feeding him Chef Kawasaki's horrid cooking. Although he is considered an anime-only character, the Sales Guy appears in Kirby Mass Attack in the sub-game Strato Patrol EOS at the game over screen. The Sales Guy is voiced by Banjo Ginga in the original version and by Dan Green in the English Dub. Monsters are the fiendish creatures in the anime. They are created by Nightmare at NightMare Enterprises where he has them sold for profit. Besides the monsters that appear in the video game, the following monsters are exclusive to the anime: * Regular Monsters - Regular monsters are the common combatant monsters used by NightMare Enterprises. There are different types of Regular Monsters in the series. **Mini-Monsters - Small monsters that cause trouble wherever they go. They come in the shape of axes, brooms, cows, cyclopes, four-armed boxers, raccoons, radishes, witch-hatted monsters, wood pieces, and wrench-armed robots. They had a small appearance in the beginning of \\"A Blockbuster Battle\\". The mini-monsters had a major part in \\"Monster Management\\" where Knuckle Joe worked for NightMare Enterprises and sent the Mini-Monsters to Cappy Town to tire Kirby out enough for the N.M.E. Sales Guy to send Masher. ** Chess Monsters - Chess monsters appeared in a flashback in \\"Kirby's Duel Role\\" where Kabu mentioned that there was one monster that Nightmare created that didn't follow his orders. In \\"Fight to the Finish\\", the chess monsters were seen in Nightmare's lair where they are shown to be larger and much different in appearances. ** Monster Soldiers - Thirteen different generic monsters ranging from green gem-wearing purple lobsters, centipedes, Ammonites, spiked armadillos, bears, silver dragons, one-horned walruses, seahorses with feet, one-eyed pterodactyls, boxing glove-wearing wolves, spiked spider-like crabs, red dragons, and brown wyverns. ** Spirit Monsters - White gust-like ghostly spirits with malicious faces. * - A fire-breathing octopus that appeared in \\"Kirby Comes to Cappy Town\\", and was the first monster that Kirby fought. Octagon first appeared as a small octopus and ended up growing upon consuming the sheep of Cappy Town. In the fight against Octagon, Kirby became Fire Kirby and destroyed Octagon. In Kirby Star Allies, Adeleine can paint Octagon as one of her moves, making Octagon the second anime monster to appear in a Kirby game, the first being Max Flexer. * - A massive statue of King Dedede that appeared in \\"Curio's Curious Discovery.\\" It was unleashed by King Dedede when the Cappies wanted to toss him out of Cappy Town, but was later destroyed by Kirby. * - A sentient robot that wields a sun staff and a moon staff that can split any living thing into its male and female half. Slice n' Splice played a part in slicing Fofa into Fololo & Falala when NightMare Enterprises sold them to King Dedede. He appeared in \\"The Fofa Factor\\" where he is ordered by King Dedede to dispose of Kirby, but is later destroyed. * - A ghost-like monster who appeared in \\"Escargoon Squad\\" where it haunted Castle Dedede. Its true motive was to collect the money for the bills that King Dedede owes to NightMare Enterprises. * - A monster with a large nose whom King Dedede ordered to help find Sir Ebrum's wedding ring. His sneezes are strong enough to blow anything away. When Honker Stomper ended up in an inhaling duel with Kirby, Tiff discovered that Honker Stomper was vulnerable to pepper and used it to cause Honker Stomper to lose control. King Dedede was angered upon him and Escargoon being sneezed against the wall and uses his hammer to send Honker Stomper flying. * - A fish-like monster with an eel-like tail. In \\"A Princess in Dis-Dress,\\" King Dedede uses Susshi to fight Commander Vee (who was actually Princess Rona in disguise). Kirby became Sword Kirby and helped Commander Vee into slicing off Susshi's tail. * - A slug-like monster with fan blades at the end of its arms which it uses to create tornadoes. In \\"Island of the Lost Warrior\\", it created a tornado that stranded Kirby, Tiff, Tuff, Fololo, and Falala on an island that was the home of Kit Cosmos. King Dedede and Escargoon arrived on Kit Cosmos' island and unleashed Tornadon on Sgt. Kit Cosmos. Kirby became Tornado Kirby and was able to destroy Tornadon. * - A ninja in the Galaxy Soldier Army's Ninja Special Forces until he betrayed them to NightMare Enterprises as experienced by Meta Knight. In \\"Ninja Binge\\", King Dedede ordered him from NightMare Enterprises to steal back Benikage's \\"failing\\" report card (which everyone thought was a ninja scroll). Yamikage nearly killed Benikage until Kirby arrives and becomes Ninja Kirby who managed to repel Yamikage. Yamikage retreats vowing to come back and get revenge on Kirby and Meta Knight. * - A fuchsia wolf which is said to have been born in the fires of Hell (with that fact being removed in the English dub). WolfWrath was one of NightMare Enterprises' most powerful creations yet he doesn't take orders very well and has a weakness to water. WolfWrath once fought Meta Knight in the past and was defeated when it fell into the lake. In \\"Hour of the WolfWrath\\", King Dedede orders WolfWrath in his latest plot to destroy Kirby. When Meta Knight came to Kirby's aid, Meta Knight fought WolfWrath until one of WolfWrath's attacks paralyzed Meta Knight causing Sword Knight and Blade Knight to fight WolfWrath. Sword Knight and Blade Knight were able to drive WolfWrath into a nearby lake and Galaxia Sword Kirby ended up destroying WolfWrath. * - A robot made by King Dedede and Escargoon in the likeness of the Ice Dragon who appears in \\"Labor Daze\\". This was hidden by the deception they used to make the Cappies think he was making appliances for them. Kirby inhaled its ice breath to become Ice Kirby and froze the furnace, causing the factory to explode and take out the robot with it. * - Monsieur Goan is a top-class chef monster. In \\"The Hot Shot Chef\\", he is ordered by King Dedede when the latter couldn't stand Chef Kawasaki's cooking anymore, leading him to build a new restaurant to counter Kawasaki's own. The two wage a restaurant war on one another until Goan turns into a six- armed monster. Kirby trades blows with him as Cook Kirby until he gets the Cook ability knocked out of him, but Kawasaki saves him from becoming frozen into sorbet with a Superspicy Curry, which causes him to blow fire all over the place, roasting Goan and destroying his restaurant. * - Hardy is a robotic dentist monster. In \\"A Dental Dilemma\\", it chased King Dedede not long after being ordered by him. Dedede tricks Kirby into trying to suck up Hardy in an attempt to yank out all of his teeth only to discover that Kirby has no teeth. Kirby inhales its dental drill to become Tornado Kirby and blows it away into the sky. * - A living maize-like monster. In \\"A Recipe for Disaster\\", King Dedede purchases it to attack Kirby while the latter is under the influence of Chef Shiitake's Gijira Extract. Kirby becomes Cook Kirby and removes the corn on its body using his frying pan, making tasty popcorn out of it as a result. * - A living broom-like monster with a crown on his head. In \\"A Novel Approach\\", he disguises himself as the famous author Rowlin to host a magic school. However, his cover is blown when the real Rowlin appears and points out the imposter, forcing him to reveal his true form. His abilities include magically controlling brooms, blasting out trash, blowing dust, and a capability of flight. The Broom King is destroyed by Cleaning Kirby. * - A woolly mammoth-like monster with the ability to blow ice from its trunk. In \\"Prediction Predicament Part 1\\", King Dedede purchases it to freeze Kirby, whom he was convinced was trying to burn him up. A torch thrown by Meta Knight allows Kirby to become Fire Kirby and reduce Fridgy to a puddle of water. * - A mechanical monster that excels at doing chores. In \\"Pink-Collar Blues\\", it replaces King Dedede's entire staff of Waddle Dees and their captain, Waddle Doo, due to King Dedede's decision to have them fired. In truth, it turns out that it wants to steal money from Dedede and send it to NightMare Enterprises as a way of making him pay his debt. Once this is found out, and the Waddle Dees return to the castle, the robot turns into a mode better suited for battle. The robot is destroyed by Stone Kirby after being picked apart by the Waddle Dees. * - A flaming jellyfish-like monster that feeds on flames to grow stronger. In \\"Tourist Trap\\", King Dedede purchases it in the form of a small orb and drops it into the volcano, turning it into its true form to attack the tourists. Fire Kirby's attacks only make Flame Feeder bigger and stronger, but ice cubes thrown by Tiff, Tuff, and the tourists enable him to become Ice Kirby and freeze it, leaving it in a weakened state and kicking its frozen form onto Dedede and Escargoon. * - Voodoo dolls made in King Dedede's likeness. In \\"Don't Bank on It\\", he distributes them across town as part of a plan to make money. His plan backfires when it is discovered that whatever happens to the dolls happens to him as well, which forces him and Escargoon to take the dolls back, only for Kirby to inhale his own doll, unknowingly sending Dedede into his stomach as well. * - A purple bag-like monster skilled at throwing bombs. In \\"Kirby Takes the Cake\\", it hides in a cake bought by King Dedede for Kirby's first anniversary of crash-landing in Cappy Town before bursting out and beginning its own bomb-tossing rampage. Dangerous Bomb is destroyed by Bomb Kirby. * - Toy-like monsters with the ability to grow in the moonlight. In \\"Snack Attack\\", King Dedede has them distributed as chocolate capsule figures, after which they then start rampaging across Cappy Town at night. It only takes one hit to destroy them, as the people of Cappy Town find out. * Martial Arts All-Stars - Toy-like monsters similar to the Figure monsters, each specializing in different types of martial arts. The members of this group include , who specializes in kung fu, , who specializes in boxing, , who specializes in karate, , who specializes in tai chi, and , who specializes in sumo wrestling. In \\"Snack Attack\\", Fighter Kirby fights and destroys all five in a five-round stadium match. * - A living windmill-like monster capable of shooting shurikens. In \\"One Crazy Knight\\", King Dedede and Escargoon have it attack and humiliate Sir Gallant, who recognizes it as a monster from his past. Windwhipper exposes Sir Gallant to himself as what he really is instead of the comic book character he modeled himself after. It is afterwards destroyed by Mirror Kirby. * - A sea urchin-like monster capable of firing its exploding missile-like spikes that uses anger to fuel its power and takes away the ability of whoever it possesses to get angry themselves before storing it up for mega-attacks. In \\"Sweet and Sour Puss\\", it renders King Dedede unable to get angry and uses the pain given to him to store up his own anger. Togeira is destroyed by Needle Kirby, who tricks its spikes into impaling it and leaves it to become angry to the point of self-destructing. * - A monster with two forms; a flying pie-like monster with five hands holding frying pans with which it can create and throw pies, and its true form being a massive stomach capable of swallowing and digesting enemies. It appears in \\"A Half-Baked Battle\\". Amusingly, Belly Buster does not take kindly to having its pies insulted for their terrible tastes by the other characters. After it swallows Kirby, King Dedede, and Escargoon, the latter two give the former the idea to become Bomb Kirby and destroy it from the inside. * - A monster teacher with a whip whose appearance is modeled after a jiangshi. In \\"eNeMeE Elementary\\", it disguises itself as a graduation cap, brainwashing people who put it on top of their heads during the classes taken at King Dedede's Dedede Academy school for Cappy Town's children. After Tuff knocks it off of Tiff's head following it accidentally falling there, it is forced to reveal its true form. Teacher Creature is destroyed by Fighter Kirby. * - A giant green crustacean monster. In \\"The Meal Moocher\\", King Dedede orders it after his crab meal ends up having spicy sauce put in it by Escargoon during the last session of his \\"Millions for a Meal\\" show at Chief Bookem's home. The Crab becomes cooked by Cook Kirby. * - A powerful gorilla/sloth/mandrill-like monster with regenerating scythes for hands and one of NightMare Enterprises' most powerful creations. It was sent by Nightmare to steal Galaxia and hid it in a dark cave until Meta Knight and Garlude succeeded in reclaiming it, with the latter sacrificing herself knowing that the former would be the one to wield Galaxia and thus being killed by the monster in the process. In the present, King Dedede, scared out of his wits of Sirica, consulted the N.M.E. Sales Guy about it, and he sent Kirisakin over to him. It quickly bested Sirica, Sword Knight and Blade Knight before ultimately being destroyed by Galaxia Sword Kirby, avenging Garlude's death as a result. * - A fitness- obsessed monster with brown skin and a pink afro. In \\"Fitness Fiend\\", King Dedede orders a supply of additive-packed potato chips from NightMare Enterprises designed to bloat Kirby into helplessness, except Dedede forgets this and ends up eating the chips himself until he and Kirby are both morbidly obese. Max Flexer is then purchased to help them burn off the fat, but Max's real motive is to destroy Kirby while he is too fat to inhale. After spitting out the chips to lose the excess weight, Kirby inhales Max's headset microphone and becomes Mike Kirby, whose singing destroys the monster and much of Dedede's castle. Max Flexer also appears in Kirby Mass Attack as an enemy in the \\"Kirby Quest\\" sub-game, making him the first anime monster to appear in a Kirby game. * - Microscopic cold monsters appearing in \\"Something to Sneeze At\\". King Dedede swallows them to make himself sick like the rest of Cappy Town when it falls under the influence of sickness. Ultimately, he decides against being sick and tries to get Kirby sick himself by inhaling them within him, but ends up sneezing Kirby out before he can inhale them all. * - A trio of monster students called , , and , who like causing trouble and picking on people, especially teachers. In \\"The School Scam\\", they attend the Dedede Academy school and Tiff attempts in vain to tame them, leading her to train with Meta Knight in how to defend herself and fight back. After she humiliates all three, they turn into a three-headed monster called MT2, who is capable of flight, spits out school supplies, and uses Kirk's mohawk to attack. MT2 is destroyed by Fighter Kirby. * - A robot riding a motorcycle who, just like his name suggests, excels at making deliveries. His motorcycle has a built-in hidden missile launcher. In \\"Delivery Dilemma\\", he is purchased by King Dedede due to the latter's frustration with how long his meal order has been taking. The Delivery Man is destroyed by Jet Kirby. * - A mechanically-modified monster with a drill on its front. In \\"Buccaneer Birdy\\", it is bought by King Dedede to help him keep Captain Kick's treasure secure for himself and Escargoon. The monster is destroyed by Mirror Kirby. * - A mad scientist fascinated with dinosaurs. In \\"Fossil Fools\\", he builds a laboratory and uses the DNA of Kirby, Tiff, Tuff, King Dedede, Escargoon, the Cappies, and Chef Kawasaki to create dinosaur-like monsters in their likenesses. Eventually turning into a monstrous form, he and his dinosaur army are destroyed by Crash Kirby. * Dr. Moro's - Dinosaur-like monsters are created by Dr. Moro in the likenesses of Kirby, Tiff, Tuff, King Dedede, Escargoon, the Cappies, and Chef Kawasaki through the use of their DNA. Included are , , , an unnamed Len dinosaur, an unnamed Mabel dinosaur, an unnamed Samo dinosaur, an unnamed Tiff dinosaur, Tuffadactyl, , and . All of them, along with Dr. Moro, are destroyed by Crash Kirby. * - A viper-like monster resembling a NƒÅga in a basketball uniform. In \\"Power Ploy\\", the N.M.E. Sales Guy sends it to deal with Kirby after he has just exhausted himself from the use of Pump Up D. After being empowered by Pump Up D again, Kirby destroys Red Viper by throwing it into the surface of the sun. * - A living trash can-like monster that pukes garbage as a means of attack, appearing in \\"A Trashy Tale\\". The N.M.E. Sales Guy sends it to Dream Land as revenge for King Dedede uploading his own fill of garbage to Nightmare's Fortress and threatening to never buy monsters from them again unless they clean it up afterwards. Trash Basher is destroyed by Cleaning Kirby. * - A robot made up of combining cooking appliances. In \\"Cooking Up Trouble\\", King Dedede distributes these appliances and holds an all-male cooking contest as part of a plan to use SlicerDicer to defeat Kirby through his appetite for food. It is destroyed by Spark Kirby. * - A samurai monster teacher known for his fierce temper. In \\"Teacher's Threat\\", he is sent to King Dedede by NightMare Enterprises to deal with Kirby, since Mr. Chip is just too nice and friendly to do anything bad to any of his students. His weapons are a bokken and an energy katana, and he can stretch his arms to abnormal lengths. Rekketsu is destroyed by Sword Kirby. * - A serpentine monster made of light and energy that spits laser-like ultraviolet rays to attack and can instantly heal itself when damaged. In \\"A Sunsational Surprise\\", the fans delivered by NightMare Enterprises make it hot outside during daytime and create a hole in the ozone layer, which is where the monster takes up residence. Jet Kirby ends up failing to destroy it, but Bomb Kirby succeeds in doing so as the monster cannot heal due to the rapid damage it takes from his bombs. * - A monster created from the fusion of Chef Nagoya's ingredients and ingredients from NightMare Enterprises that uses claws and fire spewed from its mouth to attack. It appears in \\"A Chow Challenge\\". Ebifryer is destroyed by Cook Kirby, who reflects its fire streams back at it with his frying pan. * - A monster who was created when a metal shell delivered by NightMare Enterprises took control of Escargoon's mind and turned him into a monster in \\"Shell-Shocked\\". He used an extendable tongue as well as lightning fired from his horns as a means of attack. Hammer Kirby destroyed Maimaigoon's shell and reverted him back to a scared and cowering Escargoon. * - A robotic computer-like monster who uses gaming controllers to control people's movements against their will and fires electric beams from the orbs surrounding him to attack. In \\"Tooned Out\\", he disguises himself as the famous animator Dis Walney, whose character was inspired by Walt Disney. Anige is soon forced to reveal his true form and is then destroyed by Spark Kirby. * , , &  A trio of motorcycle-riding mischief makers who love going on motorcycle rampages and causing trouble for people. The leader, Fang, tells the other members of the trio what to do and has a history with Gus. In \\"Born to Be Mild\\", they appear in Cappy Town looking for Steppenwolf, who humiliated Fang years ago and reminded Gus back then that being a biker wasn't about breaking the law but instead was about freedom. Rip and Turbo are destroyed when Kirby blocks their eyesights and makes them drive right into rocks, but Fang survives and attends Cappy Town's second race, where he is once again humiliated by Steppenwolf, is forced to transform into a monster called Wheelie, and loses to Kirby and Gus in the race. * - A cycloptic Chinese chef who, like Monsieur Goan before him, also excels at cooking delicious food. In \\"Hunger Struck\\", he feeds the Waddle Dees after they go on a hunger strike against King Dedede for not feeding them enough. He ultimately competes with Cook Kirby in a contest to see who can make better food for the Waddle Dees, and is soon destroyed by him. * - The evil clown-like leader of the monster training school, where the monsters created by Nightmare go to attend four different classes to learn how to be mean and scary and compete with each other in four different classes to become the best. He uses a whip as a means of both attack and conversion of others into monsters. In \\"Cowardly Creature\\", King Dedede buys him and has him brainwash Phan Phan into attacking Kirby. Throw Kirby defeats Whippy by throwing him into outer space where he flies into a black hole. * - A petite but powerful frog-like monster with the ability to possess people and make them do bad things. In \\"Frog Wild\\", it possesses Kirby and makes him go on a rampage throughout Cappy Town, and later possesses King Dedede as well. Its natural enemy is Heavy Anaconda. * - A large snake serving as the natural enemy of the Demon Frog that appears in \\"Frog Wild\\". It is bought by King Dedede in an attempt to have Kirby gobbled up while he's possessed by the Demon Frog, but it ends up swallowing Dedede instead since he stole the Demon Frog's possession from Kirby. Heavy Anaconda is destroyed by Fire Kirby. * - Humongous spaceships that protect Nightmare's Fortress. In \\"Air-Ride-in- Style\\", one is sent to attack King Dedede's castle in an attempt to capture Kirby's Warp Star only to ultimately be destroyed by Crash Kirby. In \\"Combat Kirby\\" and \\"Fright to the Finish\\", three of them are hijacked by Knuckle Joe, Sirica, and Sir Arthur, Sir Percival, Sir Lancelot, and Sir Galahad to help Kirby and the rest of the Halberd's crew enter Nightmare's Fortress. * - Alien creatures riding Air Ride machines that protect Nightmare's Fortress. Four of them are destroyed by Kirby using the Baton, Water, Iron, and Top abilities in a dream sent to him and Tiff by Kabu in \\"Air-Ride-in-Style\\", and the dream training given to him by Kabu pays off when he battles and destroys more of them in \\"Fright to the Finish\\" as Bomb Kirby and Fire Kirby. * - A crustacean monster resembling a fusion of an elephant and a lobster. In the special 3D episode \\"Kirby 3D,\\" it appears small at first, but eventually grows to a more monstrous size. Fire Kirby is unable to defeat Lobzilla, but it is eventually destroyed by Kabuki Kirby. NotesReferences Kirby ","title":"List of Kirby characters"},{"id":"9600049","text":"Nevada Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs, 538 U.S. 721 (2003), was a United States Supreme Court case which held that the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 was \\"narrowly targeted\\" at \\"sex-based overgeneralization\\" and was thus a \\"valid exercise of [congressional] power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\", 726-27 & n.1 (2003). The law=The FMLA The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) allows eligible employees to take up to 12 work weeks of unpaid leave annually for several reasons, including the birth of a child or the \\"serious health condition\\" of the employee's spouse, child, or parent.. The FMLA also authorizes employees whose rights under the FMLA have been violated to sue their employer for equitable relief and money damages.. In enacting the FMLA, Congress invoked two of the powers it possesses under the Constitution. In regulating private employers under the FMLA, it invoked its power under the Commerce Clause. In regulating public employers, it relied on its power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Section 5 gives Congress the power \\"to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of [the Fourteenth Amendment].\\" One of these provisions is the Equal Protection Clause, which prohibits states from denying to persons within their jurisdiction \\"the equal protection of the laws.\\" It was its power to enforce the Equal Protection Clause which Congress invoked in enacting the FMLA.538 U.S. at 727 n.1 (quoting , (5)). State sovereign immunity In Hans v. Louisiana (1890), the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Eleventh Amendment prohibits states from being sued in federal court without their consent by their own citizens, despite the Eleventh Amendment's literal language.The Eleventh Amendment prohibits suits \\"against one of the United States by Citizens of another State.\\" U.S. Const., amend. XI (emphasis added). See also (\\"[W]e have understood the Eleventh Amendment to stand not so much for what it says, but for the presupposition of our constitutional structure which it confirms.\\") Congress, however, when acting under its Section 5 power, may abrogate state sovereign immunity and allow states to be sued for money damages. The Supreme Court has held that Congress may do this only if the private remedies it enacts under Section 5 have \\"congruence and proportionality\\" to the constitutional wrongs which it seeks to redress.. Without the requisite congruence and proportionality, Congress cannot constitutionally authorize private litigants to recover money damages from the states, although such litigants can sue for equitable relief.See , 374 n.9 (2001) (citing ). Facts and procedural history of the case William Hibbs worked for the Nevada Department of Human Resources in its Welfare Division. He requested leave from the Department under the FMLA in order to care for his wife, who had been in a car accident and undergone neck surgery. The Department granted the request and told Hibbs he could use the full 12 weeks of FMLA leave intermittently as needed between May and December 1997. He used the leave intermittently until August 5 of that year, after which he did not return to work. In October the Department informed Hibbs that he had exhausted his FMLA leave and was required to report to work by November 12. When he failed to report, he was fired. Hibbs then sued the Department in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada for alleged violations of the FMLA. He sought money damages and other relief. The district court granted the Department summary judgment, finding that Hibbs's claim under the FMLA was barred by the Eleventh Amendment. Hibbs appealed the ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which held that the FMLA was a valid exercise of Congress's power under the Fourteenth Amendment, and reversed the district court's grant of summary judgment. Thereafter the Supreme Court granted certiorari. Majority opinion The majority, in an opinion authored by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, began by reaffirming City of Boerne v. Flores (1997), which was the first case to set down the \\"congruence and proportionality\\" requirement for laws enacted under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court stated that while \\"Congress' power to enforce' the [Fourteenth] Amendment includes the authority both to remedy and to deter violation of rights guaranteed thereunder by prohibiting a somewhat broader swath of conduct, including that which is not itself forbidden by the Amendment's text\\",538 U.S. at 727 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). the remedies which Congress enacts to enforce the Amendment must not constitute \\"an attempt to substantively redefine the States' legal obligations.\\"538 U.S. at 728 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). To prevent Congress from doing this, the Court said, its case law required Section 5 legislation to \\"exhibit 'congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end.'\\"538 U.S. at 728 (quoting City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. at 520). The Court acknowledged that Congress, by enacting the FMLA, had sought \\"to protect the right to be free from gender-based discrimination in the workplace.\\"538 U.S. at 728. The FMLA was meant to protect that right by guaranteeing to working women, who Congress found usually bear the primary responsibility for family caretaking, the right to take unpaid leave to deal with this responsibility while still retaining employment.538 U.S. at 728 n.2 Whether the FMLA was constitutional depended on whether Congress had evidence that the states were systematically violating women's workplace rights. Citing Bradwell v. Illinois and Goesaert v. Cleary, the majority acknowledged that there was a long history of legally sanctioned discrimination against women in employment opportunities. Congress, the majority said, first responded to this inequality by passing Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VII's abrogation of state sovereign immunity was upheld in Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, \\"[b]ut,\\" the Court said, \\"state gender discrimination did not cease.\\"538 U.S. at 730. The Court noted that \\"the persistence of such unconstitutional discrimination by the States justifie[d]\\" the passage of the FMLA, which was designed to prevent further discrimination. Moreover, continued the majority, Congress had evidence that state-offered parental leave for fathers was rare, and stated that \\"[t]his and other differential leave policies were not attributable to any differential physical needs of men and women, but rather to the pervasive sex-role stereotype that caring for family members is women's work.\\"538 U.S. at 731. Even in states where the laws were supposed to offer parental leave for fathers, such laws \\"were applied in discriminatory ways.\\" Taking these conditions into account, the majority concluded, Congress was justified in passing the FMLA. The Court added that earlier cases which had struck down laws passed under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment -- cases such as Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents and Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett -- were distinguishable. Those cases concerned legislation which Congress had enacted in order to combat what it considered discrimination on the basis of age and disability. The Court stated that because such discrimination is not subjected to heightened scrutiny under the Constitution, and because the laws invalidated in Kimel and Garrett prohibited almost all such discrimination, the previous cases struck down laws which bore little \\"congruence and proportionality\\" to the wrongs they sought to remedy. Gender- based discrimination, by contrast, is subjected to intermediate scrutiny under the Constitution, and so in enacting the FMLA \\"it was easier for Congress to show a pattern of state constitutional violations.\\"538 U.S. at 736. In addition, the majority noted, the FMLA placed certain limitations on the right of employees to take leave and limited the amount of damages which aggrieved plaintiffs could recover for violations. For those reasons, the Court said, \\"we conclude that [the FMLA's private remedy] is congruent and proportional to its remedial object, and can 'be understood as responsive to, or designed to prevent, unconstitutional behavior.'\\"538 U.S. at 740 (quoting Boerne, 521 U.S. at 532). Concurrences Justice Souter and Justice Stevens both wrote brief concurrences. Justice Souter, in whose concurrence Justices Ginsburg and Breyer joined, concurred in the Court's opinion. He believed that \\"[e]ven on this Court's view of the scope of congressional power under ¬ß 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment,\\" the FMLA was a valid enactment. He emphasized, however, that he still disagreed with the Court's interpretation of Congress's power of enforcement under the Fourteenth Amendment, citing dissents in Kimel, Garrett, and Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Board v. College Savings Bank. Justice Stevens concurred in the judgment only. He doubted that the FMLA was independently valid under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, but believed that it was a constitutional use of congressional power under the Commerce Clause. Reiterating a position he and other justices had taken in past decisions, Justice Stevens stated that the Eleventh Amendment did not prevent Congress from enacting legislation under the Commerce Clause to allow citizens to sue their own states for money damages. Thus, he concluded, Hibbs's suit was not barred by sovereign immunity and could proceed. Dissents Both Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy filed dissents. Justice Scalia joined Justice Kennedy's dissent but wished to \\"add one further observation.\\" A legal action filed against Nevada under legislation enacted in order to protect against future violations of the Equal Protection Clause, Justice Scalia said, could not be justified by showing \\"violations by another State, or by most other States, or even by 49 other States.\\" Rather, the plaintiff had to show that Congress was preventing violations of the Fourteenth Amendment \\"by the State against which the enforcement action is taken,\\"538 U.S. at 741 (emphasis in the original). which in this case was Nevada. Because Congress could not rely on what he termed \\"guilt by association\\", and because he believed the majority had not shown that each of the 50 states had engaged in gender-based violations of the Equal Protection Clause, Justice Scalia concluded that the FMLA was unconstitutional. Justice Kennedy's dissent, joined by both Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas, argued that Congress simply had not established that the states \\"engage[d] in widespread discrimination on the basis of gender in the provision of family leave benefits.\\" Justice Kennedy believed the evidence summarized by the Court was too isolated and anecdotal to established such a pattern of discrimination. He also argued that the states had actually \\"been ahead of Congress in providing gender-neutral family leave benefits.\\" The fact that gender classifications are subjected to heightened scrutiny, he said, \\"[did] not alter [his] conclusion,\\" because Hibbs still bore the \\"burden to show that Congress identified a history and pattern of unconstitutional employment discrimination by the States.\\" This was a burden, said Justice Kennedy, which Hibbs had not met. Thus the FMLA amounted to a substantive change in the reach of the Fourteenth Amendment, not an enforcement of its provisions, and under Boerne, this was unconstitutional.

He published 13 collections of poetry, 5 verse plays, including the well-known Fire on the Snow, many short stories and critical essays, and biographies of Norman Lindsay and Kenneth Slessor. He also edited several poetry anthologies. His greatest contribution to Australian literature came from his 20 years as literary editor of The Bulletin, his 10 years as a publishing editor with Angus & Robertson, and his lifetime support of Australian writers.Wilde et al. (1994) p.721 Geoffrey Serle, literary critic, has described Stewart as \\"the greatest all-rounder of modern Australian literature\\". Life Douglas Stewart was born in Eltham, Taranaki Province, New Zealand, to an Australian-born lawyer father. He attended primary school in his home town, and a high school thirty miles away, before studying at the University of Wellington. He began studying law there, but soon changed courses to major in writing and journalism. As a young boy, Stewart fell in love with the New Zealand countryside. He roamed its valleys, rivers and mountains, often camping out and frequently indulging his love of fishing. This appreciation of the wonders of nature was to last throughout his lifetime, so that in 1938, when he moved to Australia, it is understandable that he also fell in love with the unique Australian bush. This he sought to capture in his poetry. Stewart lived in Australia in 1933 for a short time, working as a free-lance journalist. He then returned to New Zealand where he continued to worked as a journalist, becoming editor of the Stratford Evening Post. In 1937, he travelled to England, employed as a pantry man on the \\"Doric Star\\". Once in England, however, he was unable to find work as a journalist, and so he worked for a short time as a barman at the \\"Churchill Arms\\" in Knightsbridge. He also met writers Edmund Blunden and John Cowper PowysStewart \\"Papers\\" He returned to Australia in 1938 and took up a position with The Bulletin. He attempted to enlist in the A.I.F. near the beginning of the war, but was rejected on medical grounds and so volunteered to serve as an air raid warden instead.Stewart (1985) p. 213 He married the painter Margaret Coen in 1945, and they had a daughter, Meg. They lived in a flat in the city of Sydney until 1953 when they moved to St Ives in the northern suburbs. It was still rural countryside then, and close to the natural beauty of Ku-ring-gai Chase. That year he won a UNESCO travelling scholarship to Europe and so the family of three spent eight months on the Continent in 1954.Stewart (1985) p. 255 Stewart and Coen maintained close friendships with several contemporary artists and literati including Norman Lindsay, Kenneth Slessor, Nancy Keesing, David Campbell, Rosemary Dobson and her publisher husband Alec Bolton, and publisher Beatrice Davis. In addition to his literary pursuits, Stewart was a keen fisherman and often went trout fishing with his friend, the poet David Campbell. He died in 1985, and was buried at Frenchs Forest Cemetery.Stewart (1985) p. 274 Literary career Stewart wrote his first poetry at fourteen years of age, while he still lived in New Zealand. He began initially because of the need to produce a poem for his school magazine, but his love for reading and writing poetry developed rapidly. He read widely, including Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Milton and Coleridge, enjoying their ability to compact powerful description into language, and to convey emotion through sound, rhythm and word selection. As he read he worked on his own writing. His father was a subscriber to The Bulletin from Australia and the young Stewart regularly sent poems to that magazine, the vast majority of which were rejected. However, he had the thrill of seeing some of his poems published in a companion magazine, The Australian Women's Mirror, as well as newspapers and magazines in New Zealand. This encouraged him to continue. After his university studies, Stewart worked as a journalist in New Zealand in the early 1930s. In 1936, he published his first volume of poems, Green Lions, before moving permanently to Australia in 1938 to become Assistant Literary Editor of The Bulletin. Two years later he was appointed Literary Editor of its \\"Red Page\\", and he retained this position for the next twenty years. He left in 1961, after a change in ownership, and joined the Australian publisher, Angus & Robertson, where he worked until 1972.Persse (2006) p. 12 He was also a member of the advisory board of the Commonwealth Literary Fund from 1955‚Äì70. The years working for The Bulletin were highly productive, both in terms of personal output and for his contribution to Australia's literary life. Goodwin writes that he \\"had a profound influence on the publishing of Australian poetry in the 1940s and early 1950s\\".Goodwin (1986) p. 143-4 Goodwin goes on to write that \\"More eclectic than he is often given credit for, he did have a distaste for rhetoric and declamation and a preference for the Audenesque air of jaunty reasonableness\\" and that \\"he was sceptical about large religious affirmation\\".Goodwin (1986) p. 144 The Bulletin, along with Meanjin and Southerly were significant magazines for promoting the poetic achievement of writers and for establishing a cultural milieu in which younger poets could refine their skills. During his editorship The Bulletin published such poets as Judith Wright, Francis Webb, David Campbell, Rosemary Dobson, Chris Wallace-Crabbe, Randolph Stow and Vivian Smith. While working with The Bulletin, Stewart published six volumes of his own poems, co-edited two books of Australian poetry, and produced a number of verse-plays and a volume of short stories. He also contributed to the script for the award-winning Australian documentary, The Back of Beyond (1954). Stewart, like Campbell, Wright and many poets of his time, drew much of his inspiration from nature, and is best known for his \\"meditative nature poems\\".Goodwin (1986) p. 141 His last book was a diary about the garden at his home in St. Ives.Stewart (1985) p. 261 The Fire on the Snow and other verse plays As well as writing poetry, Stewart also made a significant contribution in the area of radio and verse drama. The Fire on the Snow, his verse play dramatising Scott's tragic Antarctic journey, was written at night, sometimes all night, while he worked for The Bulletin magazine.Stewart (1985) p. 211 It was performed on ABC radio in 1941 to great success, and started a new interest in writing verse plays. It was broadcast on the BBC in England, and was translated into Icelandic and German. In the same year he completed his next verse play, Ned Kelly, which won an open ABC competition in 1941, and in 1942 he won again with The Golden Lover, which was a romantic comedy, a change from the previous two heroic tragedies. Ned Kelly, written for theatre, was first performed on radio in 1942. However, in 1943 it was performed in the theatre by the Sydney University Dramatic Society, and later that year was also performed in Melbourne. Correspondence with David Campbell David Campbell's first poem, Harry Pearce, was published in The Bulletin in 1942, but he and Stewart did not meet until the last year of the war.Persse (2006) p. 11 The two poets maintained a correspondence over a long period, from 1946‚Äì1979. The main subject of their correspondence was poetry, though they also covered \\"fellow authors, fishing, nature and the land\\". They discussed fellow Australian writers such as Judith Wright, R. D. Fitzgerald and Francis Webb; past writers such as Shakespeare, Wordsworth and W. B. Yeats; and also contemporary British and American writers such as Dylan Thomas, whom they both praised and criticised, and T. S. Eliot, whose later plays they did not like.Persse (2006) p. 13 In other words, their correspondence conveys their \\"exploration and understanding of poetry\\", particularly on the part of Stewart, who was \\"one of Australia's finest critics\\". Themes and style Much of his writing took nature and the natural world as its subject matter. Sometimes, such as in his work of the 1950s, he focused \\"intensely on the natural world, choosing small creatures and details close to the earth to exemplify larger themes.\\"Falkiner (1992) p. 79 Examples are \\"Frogs\\" from his 1952 Sun Orchids, and \\"The Fungus\\". Other works, though, \\"are more simply impressionistic imagery, and less thematically burdened\\". An example is \\"Brindabella\\" from his Collected Poems 1936‚Äì1967. Although nature was his main subject, he, like David Campbell and Vance Palmer, \\"did not write polemics about conservation. This became the concern of their immediate successors ‚Äì Judith Wright, Mark O'Connor and John Blight\\".Falkiner (1992) p. 129 Awards He received a number of awards in recognition of his achievements, including: * 1960: Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE)It's an Honour: OBE * 1967: Sydney Myer Award for the best volume of poetry of the year * 1967: Grace Leven Prize for Poetry for Collected Poems 1936‚Äì1967 * 1968: Britannica-Australia Award in the humanities * 1979: Officer of the Order of Australia (AO)It's an Honour: AO Selected bibliography=Poetry collections *The Green Lions (1936) *The White Cry (1939) *Elegy for an Airman (1940) *Sonnets to the Unknown Soldier (1941) *The Dosser in Springtime (1946) *Glencoe (1947) *Sun orchids (1952) *The Birdsville Track (1955) *Rutherford (1962) *Australian Poets: Douglas Stewart (1963, with new editions in 1966 and 1973) *Collected Poems: 1936‚Äì1967 (1967) Verse plays *The Fire on the Snow (first produced 1941, published 1944) *Ned Kelly (first performed 1942) *The Golden Lover (first performed 1943, and published with The Fire on the Snow 1944) *Shipwreck (1947) Other works *A Girl with Red Hair (1944, short story collection) *The Flesh and the Spirit (1948, criticism) *The Seven Rivers (1966, essay collection) *The Broad Stream (1975, criticism) *Norman Lindsay: A Personal Memoir (1975) *A Man of Sydney (on Kenneth Slessor) (1977) *Writers of \\"The Bulletin\\" (1977) *Springtime in Taranaki: An Autobiography of Youth (1983) *Douglas Stewart's Garden of Friends (1987, published posthumously) Edited works *Australian Bush Ballads (1955, with Nancy Keesing) *Old Bush Songs and Rhymes of Colonial Times (1957, with Nancy Keesing) *Modern Australian Verse (1964) *The Pacific Book of Bush Ballads (1967, with Nancy Keesing) NotesReferences *Goodwin, Ken (1986) A history of Australian literature (\\"Macmilllan history of literature\\" series), Basingstoke, Macmillan. *Falkiner, Suzanne (1992) Wilderness (Series: Writers' Landscape), East Roseville, Simon and Schuster. *Persse, Jonathan (2006) \\"Letters lifted into poetry\\" in National Library of Australia News, XVII/2, November 2006, pp. 11‚Äì14. *Stewart, Douglas, Papers of Douglas Stewart and the Stewart family, 1911‚Äì1989: Biographical Note.

The cell wall needs to be modified in order to maintain the turgor pressure. This modification is controlled by plant hormones like auxin. Auxin also controls the expression of some cell wall genes. This form of growth does not involve an increase in cell number. During acid growth, plant cells enlarge rapidly because the cell walls are made more extensible by expansin, a pH-dependent wall-loosening protein. Expansin loosens the network-like connections between cellulose microfibrils within the cell wall, which allows the cell volume to increase by turgor and osmosis. A typical sequence leading up to this would involve the introduction of a plant hormone (auxin, for example) that causes protons (H+ ions) to be pumped out of the cell into the cell wall. As a result, the cell wall solution becomes more acidic. It was suggested by different scientist that the epidermis is a unique target of the auxin but this theory has been disapproved over time. This activates expansin activity, causing the wall to become more extensible and to undergo wall stress relaxation, which enables the cell to take up water and to expand. The acid growth theory has been very controversial in the past.

The Lord Howe flax snail has a brown, pointed shell up to 7 cm long and 2 cm in diameter. Conservation=Species decline Historical accounts and fossil evidence indicate that the Lord Howe Island flax snail was formerly widespread and abundant on the island. The decline was first noted in the 1940s and the species is now listed as critically endangered. The black rat is considered to be the major predator of this species and likely to be a significant threat to its survival. European blackbirds and song thrushes (self-introduced around 1950) are also thought to be predators of the snail. Habitat clearing and modification and habitat disturbance, possibly herbicides and pesticides also add to the species decline. Recovery In 2001, a recovery plan was completed to protect and recover the Lord Howe Island flax snail in the wild. Actions include habitat and population surveys, community awareness raising and a captive-breeding program. The Lord Howe Island Board, responsible for implementation of the recovery plan, has since constructed a rodent and bird proof enclosure for the project and the first generation of captive bred Lord Howe Island land snails has hatched. Over a period of two years, schoolchildren will closely monitor the captive snail population and their eggs, and will then measure growth rates and survival rates of the juvenile snails. Rodent control or eradication on the island is crucial for the long- term survival of this snail in the wild.

The CRK protein participates in the Reelin signaling cascade downstream of DAB1.  Function  Adapter molecule crk is a member of an adapter protein family that binds to several tyrosine- phosphorylated proteins. This protein has several SH2 and SH3 domains (src- homology domains) and is involved in several signaling pathways, recruiting cytoplasmic proteins in the vicinity of tyrosine kinase through SH2-phosphotyrosine interaction. The N-terminal SH2 domain of this protein functions as a positive regulator of transformation whereas the C-terminal SH3 domain functions as a negative regulator of transformation. Two alternative transcripts encoding different isoforms with distinct biological activity have been described. Crk together with CrkL participates in the Reelin signaling cascade downstream of DAB1. v-Crk, a transforming oncoprotein from avian sarcoma viruses, is a fusion of viral \\"gag\\" protein with the SH2 and SH3 domains of cellular Crk. The name Crk is from \\"CT10 Regulator of Kinase\\" where CT10 is the avian virus from which was isolated a protein, lacking kinase domains, but capable of stimulating phosphorylation of tyrosines in cells.

William Neill). and starring Boris Karloff. The striking cinematography was done by Allen G. Siegler. Plot In a Tyrolean castle in the late 18th century, twin sons, Gregor and Anton, are born to the de Berghmann baronial family. The baron is concerned: an old prophecy in the family states that the younger brother shall kill the elder in the Black Room of the castle. Some years later in 1834,http://www.dvddrive-in.com/reviews/i-m/iconsofhorrorkarloff3542.htm it is revealed that the Baron Gregor (Boris Karloff) has become a depraved ruler who murders the wives of local peasants. His brother, Anton (also played by Karloff), who cannot use his right arm and has spent much of his life traveling Europe, returns to the castle for a visit, but refuses to believe the rumors he hears about Gregor. The kindly Anton becomes popular with the villagers and the castle staff, being the exact opposite of his brother. At the same time, Gregor's attempts to woo Thea (Marian Marsh), daughter of family advisor Colonel Hassell, fail noticeably before both her admiration for Anton and her true love for young Lieutenant Albert Lussan (Robert Allen). When the castle servant Mashka (Katherine DeMille) disappears after being seen with Gregor, the locals form a mob and enter the castle, confronting the baron. Gregor agrees to abdicate, and give power to his brother, who has become popular. After the papers are signed to relinquish his baronetcy to Anton, he lures his unsuspecting brother to the Black Room, kills him, and throws him into the pit where the dead bodies of Mashka and his other victims are kept. Gregor now assumes Anton's identity, and prepares to wed Thea, whose father supports their union. Lt. Lussan angrily and threateningly objects to the Colonel; Gregor kills the Colonel and easily frames the Lieutenant, who is found guilty and sentenced to death. Only Anton's mastiff recognizes that the baron is not his master, and the dog pursues Gregor when he travels to town for his wedding. Meanwhile, Lussan escapes his cell and meets secretly with Thea, who urges him to flee. He refuses, however, and the wedding ceremony begins in the town cathedral. As the stately ceremony draws to a close, the priest asks for any who object to the union to \\"speak now or forever hold their peace\\", and the dog attacks \\"Anton\\", who defends himself with his supposedly paralyzed right arm. Standing thus revealed, Gregor flees. The townspeople gathered for the wedding form a mob in a matter of seconds. The dog, followed by the mob, which includes Lussan, pursues Gregor to the castle, where he attempts to hide in the Black Room. The mob discovers where he is and begins to batter open the secret door. Before they can gain passage, however, the dog squeezes through and throws himself on Gregor, who falls backward into the pit and onto the knife still held in his murdered brother's crippled hand. Thus, the prophecy is fulfilled. Cast * Boris Karloff as Baron Gregor de Berghmann / Anton de Berghmann * Marian Marsh as Thea Hassel * Robert Allen as Lt. Albert Lussan * Thurston Hall as Col.

Greene praised both the acting of Karloff and the direction of Neill, noting that Karloff had been given a long speaking part and \\"allowed to act at last\\", and that Neill had \\"caught the genuine Gothic note\\" in a manner that displayed more historical sense than any of Alexander Korda's films.

Description This species is about 24 cm long. The bill is oddly shaped: long, slender, and very sharp, looking almost upturned. Adults of both sexes are described by their name. Juveniles have entirely black plumage; orange-red feathers first appear on their breast and throat, later spreading to the neck, head, and thighs. The song is given as \\"loud, clear, and melodic, a ringing 'cleer-cleer-clur, clulululu'.\\" Calls are simpler but have a similar quality.

They often perch conspicuously on top of stems. They are uncommon, particularly away from the coast. They eat mainly fruit, supplementing it with seeds and invertebrates, especially insects. They use their bill as a hammer to open food items. Scarlet-headed blackbirds are monogamous, and territories are grouped together. The nest is an open cup placed in the crotch of a shrub or woven into vegetation, in which they lay two eggs.

Anthony Koester, more commonly known as Tony Koester, is a well-known member of the United States model railroading community. Koester popularized the idea of proto-freelancing with his HO scale model railroad layout, the Allegheny Midland, along with his friend Allen McClelland's Virginian & Ohio. Koester is an alumnus of Purdue University where he studied electrical engineering. While at Purdue, he was also a member of the Model Railroad Club. In 1966, he helped co-found the Nickel Plate Historical & Technical Society to preserve the memory of his favorite railroad. In 1973, Koester relocated to Stillwater, a town in northern New Jersey to take a position with Carstens Publications as editor of Railroad Model Craftsman. It was during this time that he developed a close friendship with Jim Boyd, the editor of Carstens' Railfan & Railroad. It was Koester's exposure to eastern mountain coal railroading in the Appalachians that led him to develop the concept of the Allegheny Midland. Blending elements of Nickel Plate equipment and operation with Chesapeake & Ohio structures and scenery, the Allegheny Midland became the Nickle Plate's plausible West Virginia coal-hauler.See Allegheny Midland Historical Society for photos, diagrams and other documentation of the layout. Regular updates in the pages of Railroad Model Craftsman made the Allegheny Midland known to modelers across America. Koester left Carstens and took a job with Bell Laboratories, editing their publications for many years. In the mid-1980s, he began a regular monthly column called \\"Trains of Thought\\" in the pages of Model Railroader, published by Kalmbach. After twenty years editing telecommunication journals, Koester took on more work with Kalmbach, and became the editor of the annual Model Railroad Planning, a contributing editor and the \\"Trains of Thought\\" columnist for Model Railroader. He has also written nine books for Kalmbach (one per year since 2003): * Realistic Model Railroad Operation (2003) * Realistic Model Railroad Design (2004) * Realistic Model Railroad Building Blocks (2005) * The Model Railroader's Guide to Coal Railroading (2006) * Planning Scenery for your Model Railroad (2007) * Designing & Building Multi-Deck Model Railroads (2008) * The Allegheny Midland: Lessons Learned (2009) * Model Railroading from Prototype to Layout (2010) * The Model Railroader's Guide to Mountain Railroading (2011) In 2000, the Allegheny Midland was decommissioned and planning began for a complex multi-deck version of the Nickel Plate's Third District in HO scale. Concentrating on timetable and train order operations, this layout replicated the Nickel Plate Koester grew up with in his hometown in Indiana.

The disease is found worldwide and it is more extensively distributed than either loose smut or false loose smut.  Symptoms  Infected plants do not demonstrate symptoms until heading. Kernels of infected plants are replaced by masses of dark brown smut spores. Smutted heads are hard and compact. Infected plants may be stunted. Occasionally smut sori may also develop in leaf blades, where they appear as long streaks.  Disease cycle  Infection is seed-borne within the seed, the fungus penetrating the endosperm while the grain is being formed. Infected seeds give rise to systemically infected plants. The mycelium advances through the host tissue and becomes established behind the growing point. The spores are not readily blown or washed away by wind or rain. Spores are sticky in nature when present inside the membrane due to oily coating. At harvest, spore masses are broken up, scattering spores on grain. Frequently, masses of spores remain intact and appear in harvested grain. The fungus overwinters as teliospores on seed or in soil.  Pathotypes  At least 13 pathotypes are known; virulence is governed by at least three single recessive and independent gene pairs.  Management  Resistant cultivars and seed treatments are used to manage this disease.  Fungicides  Seed treatments: carboxin, fenpiclonil, tebuconazole, triadimenol, triticonazole.

Formed by Maggie Drennon (then named Stephanie Bingham) on vocals, flute and bodhr√°n and Mary Maddux on vocals and guitar, the duo performed a combination of traditional and contemporary Irish and Scottish folk songs at local festivals and venues like Houston's Red Lion Pub and later McGonigel's Mucky Duck Pub. Their first album was a limited release cassette, One Voice in 1991. At the CD release performance for their second album, Circles of Stone in 1993 at the Mucky Duck, Maggie saw Chuck Ivy enter the room and called from the stage \\"You know something about sound. Fix it!\\" thus enlisting him as their sound engineer for the next year. Melanie O'Sullivan joined as a singer in January 1994 and Chuck moved from behind the sound board onto the stage as bass guitar and Chapman Stick player in October of the same year for the recording of the group's third album C√©il√≠'s Muse Live: Muse Secret #73. In the summer of 1995 Mary moved to New England leaving the group searching for a guitarist. A temporary replacement was found in local musician Lia Salo who played with C√©il√≠'s Muse on the Houston Celtic live festival recording Blarney Fest '95, an album also featuring Houston's Flying Fish Sailors and Clandestine. Lia's time in the band was brief, however, so again they recruited from their support staff, this time pulling in their live albums' engineer Anders Johansson to add acoustic and electric guitars to the mix. An album with this lineup was released in late 1995 as The Dark Lady and the band toured the Midwest and the East Coast as well as the North Texas Irish Festival. This lineup also performed at and recorded another festival the next year, Son of Blarneyfest, again with the Flying Fish Sailors and introducing another local Celtic group, Gordian Knot. Mary Maddux also returned to perform a few songs solo for this show. Between the fall of 1996 and spring of 1997, the band reorganized yet again with Melanie leaving the group and Mike Byers joining on guitar, bouzouki, and mandolin. Wolf Loescher of Austin's \\"Two O'Clock Courage\\" also sat in on percussion for numerous gigs during the Spring and Summer of 1997. Chuck left the group in 1997 and the group performed a few more shows as C√©il√≠'s Muse after he left, but ultimately disbanded, with some members regrouping as SixMileBridge the next year. Still, C√©il√≠'s Muse was nominated for Houston Press music award for Best Ethnic Music some 18 months after the band officially broke up.

On the track Vuelve Candy B. was foaled in Potrero Hermosura in Puerto Rico. As a yearling in 1989 he was acquired by the RI-JE-SU Stable for the sum of $20,000. Originally named \\"Oiste Candy B,\\" he won his debut race on August 8, 1990 while ridden by Edwin Castro. The horse finished his two-year-old season (1990) with 3 first places, 2 second places and one third place finish in six races. In 1991 Oiste Candy B won his last race with his original name. The horse's owner was arrested and his horses were sold in a federal auction. Later that year, he was acquired by Luito Hernandez, owner of the Est. Nori Annette, in a federal auction by $75,000. His new owner decided to change the name of the horse to Vuelve Candy B. That year, Vuelve Candy B. won 13 straight races including the Puerto Rican Triple Crown ridden by Alexis Feliciano. He also won the Clasico Dia de la Raza and Clasico Budweiser that same year. He came in first place in the Clasico Dia del Veterano but was disqualified to second place in favor of Tatra Voltage due to hampering in the final stretch. In December 1991, Vuelve Candy B. represented Puerto Rico in the Clasico del Caribe which was celebrated at the El Nuevo Comandante horse track in Puerto Rico. Vuelve Candy B., ridden by Julio A. Garcia, finished third but a few days later was declared the official winner of the race because of the disqualification of Venezuelan horses Rio Chamita and Landrea due to positive testing of illegal substances. In 1992 at the age of four, Vuelve Candy B. continued his dominance by winning 14 out of 15 races. Among them were the Clasico Eugenio Mar√≠a de Hostos, the Clasico Dia de las Madres, the Clasico Antonio R Barcelo, the Clasico Dia de La Raza and the Clasico Dia del Veterano. He lost his last race of the year in the Cofraternity Cup to By Pass, a Panamanian horse. In 1993, Vuelve Candy B. won another 19 races (13 of them consecutively) and setting a record for the most stakes won in Puerto Rican Horse Racing. He battled Imbuia Pajoqui, a Puerto Rican filly, in many of these stakes races creating sensation among the Puerto Rican horse racing fans. As a six-year-old, Vuelve Candy B. won the Clasico Eugenio Mar√≠a de Hostos by defeating 1993 Clasico del Caribe winner, Verset's Jet. This was Vuelve Candy B. only win against Verset's Jet who won his next 6 races against Vuelve Candy B. In May 1994, Vuelve Candy B. won his 16th and last stakes race by winning his third Clasico Dia de las Madres, beating Imbuia Pajoqui by a nose. After this, Vuelve Candy B. kept racing but began to win less and less. On December 1994, VCB won his seventy fourth and last race while ridden by Wilfredo Rohena. In 1995, he participated in the Clasico Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n but did not finish due to an injury.

But in 1998, he was brought back to race at El Nuevo Comandante. On the morning of August 9, 1998 Vuelve Candy B. suffered a severe injury in his stall and was humanely euthanized. Vuelve Candy B. ended his racing career with 63 wins in 85 starts. He came in second 12 times, third 6 times, and fourth 3 times. He ran only one race out of the money, when he did not finish in his last start. His total career earnings amounted to $1,035,789.

November 1911‚ÄìJanuary 1912 Ypsilanti Daily Press The cold wave began in November 1911 when the Great Blue Norther dropped temperatures abruptly. It was the coldest November on record in the contiguous U.S., with an average temperature of , while December was relatively mild. January 1912 was the seventh-coldest January on record in the contiguous U.S. The states of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota had their coldest Januaries on record. Minneapolis/Saint Paul endured a record-setting 186 consecutive hours of below temperatures, from 8 pm on December 31 until 1 pm on January 8. After only four hours above 0 ¬∞F, the temperature again dropped below zero, this time for 121 consecutive hours, until 10 am on January 13. Sioux Falls, South Dakota dropped to on January 12, which is the city's second-lowest temperature during its 1893 through 2017 period of record.

The character made her debut in 1980, and after a brief portrayal by Tammy Taylor, Lilibet Stern took over for three years, followed by Andrea Evans until 1984. The character was re-introduced by former head writer Maria Arena Bell 25 years later in 2009, with Stacy Haiduk taking over the role. She appeared sporadically for an additional three years. Much of Patty's history revolves around her romance with Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman), as well as her repeated mental health issues. Casting The role was originated by actress Tammy Taylor in 1980, who left soon after her debut and was immediately replaced with Lilibet Stern, who remained in the role until June 1983. Following Stern's departure, the role was recast with Andrea Evans, who portrayed the role from July 1983 to October 1984. In 2009, Stacy Haiduk began portraying \\"Mary Jane Benson,\\" later revealed to be Patty. During this storyline, actress Tammy Barr portrayed Patty in flashbacks. In October 2009, Haiduk began portraying dual roles as Patty and Emily Peterson. In June 2010, it was announced that Haiduk had been let go from The Young and the Restless. She made her last appearance on August 6, 2010. In 2011, it was announced that Haiduk would be reprising the role, with her return beginning on October 24, 2011. In March 2012, speculation arose that Haiduk had finished her stint with the soap opera. In a response to a fan on her Facebook page, Haiduk stated: \\"I am not sure what Y&R; is doing. I am a bit disappointed, so I don't know what to tell you. They just didn't want to write for me, I guess.\\" However, seven months later, it was announced on Haiduk's web page that she would be returning on September 20, 2012, which occurred for one week. In 2013, when asked of her current status with the soap opera, Haiduk stated: \\"As you see, I come back and leave, I come back and leave.\\" In August 2015, it was announced that Haiduk will once again reprise her role as Patty, airing on September 21. In November 2016, it was announced that Haiduk had wrapped up her stint as Patty, last airing November 8. Storylines=1980‚Äì84 Patty fell in love with Jabot heir Jack Abbott, much to her parents' disapproval.Cassata, p. 184-185.Cassata, p. 141-143. A jealous Jill Foster then confesses to Patty that she and Jack have been secret lovers. A furious Jack fires Jill from Jabot. Patty then accepts a date from Danny Romalotti. Patty and Jack Abbott (pictured) at their wedding in 1982. Patty eventually leaves Danny and becomes involved with Jack again. Patty's father, Carl, tries to break up the union, and Jack retaliates by marrying Patty in June 1982. Patty soon becomes suspicious that Jack is only interested in her for sex. Jack, meanwhile, begins seeing Diane Jenkins behind Patty's back. When Patty catches Jack and Diane together in his office, she is so traumatized that she trips over a plant in the lobby and miscarries. When Patty recovers, she tells Jack she wants another child. Later she overhears Jack telling Jill of his plans to have a vasectomy, and that he only married Patty so that his father, John Abbott, would make him president of Jabot. This sends Patty over the edge and she arrives at Jack's office with a loaded gun to kill herself in front of Jack. Jack admits to Patty that he has been cruel to her, and begs her not to shoot herself, but to shoot him. Patty shoots Jack three times. Patty temporarily loses all memory of the shooting. Jack survives and is paralyzed in a hospital bed for some time. Patty's father Carl is the police detective in charge of finding Jack's attacker and becomes convinced Jill has done it. Only Jack knows that Patty shot him. After the truth comes out, Jack refuses to press charges and attempts to reconcile with her. Patty decides to divorce him. She then becomes involved again with Danny. However, Danny soon marries a pregnant Traci Abbott, even though he is not the father, to give the child a name. Traci tells Patty that the marriage is only temporary until the baby is born and they will get a divorce. As the pregnancy progresses, Traci begins to fall in love with Danny and when Patty confronts her, she accidentally causes Traci to fall down the stairs and miscarry. Seeing no future with Danny, who blames her for the loss of Traci's child, Patty leaves town. 2009‚Äì10 Patty returns to town 25 years later, operating under the alias Mary Jane Benson. Flashback scenes in Mary Jane Benson's dreams of young Patty reveal that she is indeed Patty Williams. Victor Newman paid for Patty to undergo plastic surgery to look like her psychiatrist, Emily Peterson, in order to infiltrate Jabot and get close to Jack. Victor's plan backfires as Patty becomes unstable and commits a number of illegal acts in her pursuit of Jack. Patty goes into hiding after causing Summer Newman to have an allergic reaction to peanuts in an attempt to keep Phyllis Newman away from Jack. While in hiding, Patty takes Colleen Carlton hostage. In an effort to escape, Colleen gets into a boat and rows away, only to fall into the water. Victor and Jack corner Patty in the woods and attempt to save Colleen. Patty shoots Victor before being taken to a mental institution. Colleen eventually dies. Emily Peterson arrives in Genoa City to treat Patty. Jack is initially hostile towards her because of her resemblance to Patty, but they eventually fall in love and plan to marry. When Patty discovers this, Patty retaliates by knocking Emily out and takes her place at the wedding, leaving Emily in her cell at the mental institution. Patty struggles to keep others from discovering the truth about the switch, but her erratic behavior makes Jack and Phyllis suspicious. Jack discovers the truth after finding Patty's diary. To keep up the facade, she once again switches places with Emily, right before Jack gets to the mental institution. The ruse fails, and Jack attempts to reunite with Emily. In 2010, Victor's devious son Adam Newman was believed to be killed, but it eventually turned out that the man, who burned in a fire was Richard Hightower, who had Adam's DNA because of a transplant from him. After Adam is the prime suspect in Hightower's murder case, it is believed that it was indeed Patty who killed Hightower, believing that he was Adam. She has vivid memories of the night and remembers specific details on how she stabbed Richard. Patty was also responsible for the gas leak at the Masquerade ball and the explosion that occurred right after. With the help of her diary, Patty realized she did not kill Richard Hightower; however, Adam snuck into the mental institution to once again mess with Patty's mind in making her believe she did kill Richard Hightower and switched notes in her diary while Patty was asleep. When Patty awoke, Adam convinced her he was Hightower and led her out of the mental institution through the vents and sent her off to Canada to become a nun and convinced her to never return to Genoa City. On August 6, 2010, Patty called Paul saying that she was not going to return to Genoa City and that she loves him. Paul later informed Emily and Jack that she called him and traced the call to somewhere in South America. Patty was last seen with red hair flirting with a man named Alejandro, and she suggested that he call her Mary Jane and him Jack. 2011‚Äì12 In 2011, a mystery guest appears outside the Abbott mansion, where Diane Jenkins is trying to seduce Jack. The mysterious person was rumored to be Nikki Newman, as she disappeared from rehab. Diane is murdered only hours later and in October a mystery person is text messaging from the phone of detective Ronan Malloy to confront the suspects in Diane's murder. During an explosion at the home of Genevieve Atkinson, her housekeeper Myrna Murdock is found with burns in her face. The woman is later shown with a cat tattoo on her leg. As Jack appears to be good friends with Genevieve, kissing her on the cheek, Myrna is seen upset. Meanwhile, Genevieve feels terrible over what happened to Myrna and promises to take care of her. While having her face bandaged, Jack tries to talk to Myrna, but she would not answer him. As she later reveals her face to Genevieve it is seen that Myrna is in fact Patty. It is later revealed that Patty made a film to taunt the nine suspects in the murder of Diane, as well as individually torturing Ashley Abbott and Nick Newman by calling them and playing the recordings she made of their confrontations with Diane in the park. Patty remained under the alias Myrna Murdock, working for Genevieve, who by this point is dating Jack. Patty attempts to break them up several times, such as poisoning their meals on Thanksgiving. When Jack proposed to Genevieve and she accepted, Patty later went ballistic, and ripped the blanket that Jack and Genevieve had sex on to pieces. She was later seen sewing a pillow that read, \\"Alcohol doesn't get you drunk, bartenders do.\\" Afterward, she tossed it into the nearby fireplace. It is then revealed that perhaps Patty sewed all the pillows that were left in Diane's room at the Genoa City Athletic Club the night of her murder. On New Year's Eve, Patty sneaks into Gloworm to spy on Jack and Genevieve. Later on, she poisons their glasses of champagne, and Jack begins to feel extremely tired. Genevieve brings him home to rest, where \\"Myrna\\" then creates a diversion, causing Genevieve to leave. While gone, Patty gets into bed with Jack and starts talking to him. When Jack wakes up, Patty is gone and her cat is lying next to him. He thinks the whole ordeal was a dream. Patty continues to attempt to divert Genevieve from Jack by making things up by telling her the house alarm keeps going off. As a result, Genevieve went to stay with Jack and wanted \\"Myrna\\" to come with her, though she was able to convince Genevieve that she would be fine at her house. Genevieve has Ronan investigate the bizarre occurrences at her house and he requests to speak with \\"Myrna\\"; however, Patty continues to divert him, one time by posting a ripped page from Diane's diary on his windshield to keep him from questioning her. Shortly after Patty's brother Paul arrives at Genevieve's house to question \\"Myrna\\", however, she had already fled the house, leaving behind the laptop she used while working for Genevieve. Paul later discovers the security camera pictures of Ashley pushing Diane to the ground on \\"Myrna\\"'s laptop, leading into a search for her. After hiding in the shed at the Newman Ranch for a while, Patty goes to the Genoa City Athletic Club and poses as Emily. She tries to convince Jack not to marry Genevieve, though when Jack attempts to let the two meet, Patty quickly flees. The next day, Tucker McCall discovers Patty at Crimson Lights, again assuming she is Emily. Patty continues to pose as Emily and goes to Jack's house to speak with him, hours before his wedding with Genevieve. She attempts to win him back saying that their happiness was thwarted by Patty, however Jack turns her down nicely and she leaves. Patty becomes quite aggravated afterwards, and she returns to the shed and pulls a pistol, presumably to shoot Genevieve. However, Adam finds her in the shed and tries to persuade her not to shoot Genevieve or anyone else, though she throws acid in his face before hitting him over the head with a piece of wood, fleeing as Adam remains unconscious. Patty arrives at Genevieve's house to find her writing a Dear John letter to Jack. As Patty hides in her house, she watches Genevieve hand the letter in an envelope with various other things that Jack gave Genevieve to a delivery man so he can deliver it to the church where they were going to marry. Patty then steals Genevieve's wedding dress and arrives at the church attempting to convince the delivery man she is Jack's personal assistant; however, he does not believe her and she knocks him unconscious. Now dressed in Genevieve's dress, Patty walks down the aisle to the altar with her face covered, and as Jack reveals her face, he thinks it is Emily, though Patty becomes enraged by that fact and reveals that she is Patty before shooting Jack in the stomach. At the same time of all this, Deacon Sharpe reveals to Paul and Ronan that he spoke to the woman they are searching for, as well as telling them she was obsessed with cats, leading Paul to realize that \\"Myrna\\" is Patty, and she is involved in Diane's murder. Patty decided to hide in her brother Todd's church where she meets nephew Ricky Williams, who promised to protect her. However that was all a scam, Ricky was just doing it to write an article for Restless Style on Patty and Jack. Shortly after Ronan and Paul find them, and Patty is escorted to the police station and was imprisoned. Shortly after, she is moved to a high-security prison for attempted murder. Patty returned briefly when Paul visited her to ask her who helped her break out of the mental facility in 2010; she told him it was Adam. At the same time, Patty told Paul that she was having a repressed memory of shooting Jack which brought her to tears, but Paul comforted her and told her it was all a dream. Seven months later, Patty reappeared when Paul arranged for her to move to Fairview Psychiatric Hospital for her to receive the appropriate treatment, and he was discouraged to find out that his sister's condition had not improved. During Paul's visit, Patty was able to distract the doctors to allow for Paul to sneak into Daisy Carter's room, whom he needed to question regarding his upcoming murder trial. When Daisy suddenly disappeared, Paul was told that her mother checked her out of Fairview, leading to confusion as Sheila Carter had died five years prior. When Paul asked Patty if he saw the mystery person who left with Daisy, Patty's response possibly links her to Daisy's disappearance. 2015‚Äì16 Patty meets Sharon Newman at Fairview Psychiatric Hospital, where she had checked herself in for evaluation and where Patty had continued to reside. Sharon, who had suffered a miscarriage prior to her admittance, was put in the care of Dr. Sandra Anderson, who ended up drugging Sharon so heavily that she believed she was still pregnant. Patty, who had been witnessing Dr. Anderson's actions, was repeatedly silenced and locked up by other orderlies so that she would not reveal what Dr. Anderson was doing. As a result, Patty escapes Fairview in order to find Dylan McAvoy, her newfound nephew and Sharon's husband, at a Halloween party at the Newman Enterprises tower and tell him that Sharon is not really pregnant and Dr. Anderson is purposely mistreating her. However, Patty ends up finding Jack at the party and attacking him and his wife, Phyllis Abbott. When a fire breaks out in the tower, panic ensues and Jack later informs Paul that he and Phyllis encountered Patty, leading to a search for her, but when her body is not found, she is presumed dead. However, Patty is soon shown to be alive in the remains of the building, encountering evil mastermind and the person behind the fire, Ian Ward, who tells her to come on the run with him. Soon after, Patty and Ian are seen in a motel room, where he tells her she must come up with a new name for herself if she is going to go along with him. Several months later, Paul is informed that Patty was found by police living on the street after Ian abandoned her. He consoles her and ultimately sends her back to Fairview, to which she is extremely reluctant as she is scared of Dr. Anderson. Meanwhile, Sharon, who had seemingly given birth to a son and was now home with Dylan, had large gaps in her memory of her time at Fairview as well as the night she supposedly gave birth, still being heavily drugged. Patty deduces that Sharon was in fact never pregnant and the child is actually that of Sharon's ex-husband Nick; Dr. Anderson had arranged for the boy to be stolen from Genoa City Memorial Hospital and have a nurse tell Nicholas and his wife Sage Warner that their son died. Dr. Anderson is then revealed to in fact be Sandra Allen, a woman who once suffered an injury at a party thrown by Nicholas at the Newman ranch when they were younger and she stole his child as revenge. Patty confronts Dr. Anderson, who laments that this is true while preparing to stab Patty with a syringe. Patty, however, ends up stabbing and killing Dr. Anderson with a letter opener in self-defense when she comes after her, but the incident ultimately sends her into a catatonic state and she is unable to reveal any of the information she knows to Paul, Sharon, Dylan, Nick or Sage. As a result, Patty is moved to a facility with higher security; Sharon later goes to visit her with questions about her time at Fairview when she was supposedly pregnant, during which Patty tells her she was never pregnant and it was all a ruse orchestrated by Dr. Anderson. Months later, during which Sharon continued to pass Nick and Sage's child off as her own, a more vibrant Patty begins contacting Sharon from the facility, threatening to reveal her secret to everyone. Sharon, however, manages to steal the cell phone Patty was using so that she would not be able to contact her or anyone else further, hoping that would put an end to the threats. However, Patty still manages to contact Nick and reveals the truth to him. Paul also visits his sister and presses her for details, during which she also reveals the truth to him.

It is owned by Community Newspaper Holdings Inc. History Originally published as The Pictorial Press, this newspaper was founded by Clyde D. Cain and wife Margaret B. Cain, in August 1963. Page layout began on the family dining room table at Big Hollow, 8 miles south of Tahlequah in Cherokee County, Oklahoma. After a modest beginning, the publication began to grow in subscriptions when historic pictures of people and places throughout the county were published, to include requests for information regarding those photographs. The paper also contained stories of past and current events in the outlying rural communities. Many local merchants were regular advertisers. As the paper grew, operating space became limited. Cain rented a building on State Street in Tahlequah in 1964 to accommodate production requirements. At that time, Cain also hired Ted Risenhoover and his wife Carol as employees of the paper. Cain was said to always be looking for new adventures and quickly tired of the newspaper business, selling the publication to Risenhoover in 1965. Risenhoover owned the paper for a number of years before selling it.

It is located about to the northwest/west of Helsinki Central railway station, in the core of the industrial area of the district of Pit√§j√§nm√§ki. History= As Str√∂mberg  The first iteration of the station was opened on 1 December 1949 under the name Str√∂mberg. It was built exclusively to serve the workers of the Str√∂mberg factory in the district of Pit√§j√§nm√§ki; trains would only stop during times corresponding to the opening and closing times of work shifts at the facilities, and the only pathway to the halt was through the private area of the factory yards. As the Huutoniemi halt on the Sein√§joki‚ÄìVaasa railway was also called Str√∂mberg at the time, fulfilling a similar purpose in Vaasa, it was first renamed Huutom√§ki on the day of the opening of the halt in Pit√§j√§nm√§ki. Coinciding with parts of the rantarata being expanded to double track, Str√∂mberg received another wooden side platform in 1958.  As Valimo  The Str√∂mberg halt was closed on 30 May 1976 and was replaced by the contemporary station of Valimo, some to the east from the old platforms towards Helsinki. Unlike Str√∂mberg, however, Valimo was intended to serve the entire industrial area in Pit√§j√§nm√§ki. During the construction of the Lepp√§vaara City Line, an additional pair of tracks from Helsinki to Lepp√§vaara exclusively to be used by trains on the Helsinki commuter rail network, temporary platforms were built in Valimo in 1995. The wholly renovated station was inaugrated on 16 October 2000. By that time, the area served by the station had over 9,000 jobs. In 2000, the ABB Group group proposed that the Valimo halt be once again renamed Str√∂mberg (Swedish: ); the proposal was also backed by the city council of Helsinki. The plan was not accepted by the Railway Administration, however.  Services  Valimo is served by lines and on the Helsinki commuter rail network.

A zero fret is a fret placed at the headstock end of the neck of a banjo, guitar, mandolin, or bass guitar. It serves one of the functions of a nut: holding the strings the correct distance above the other frets on the instrument's fretboard. A separate nut is still required to establish the correct string spacing when a zero fret is used.  Function  The zero fret is positioned at the location normally occupied by the nut. On a guitar having a zero fret, the nut is located behind the zero fret and serves solely to keep the strings spaced properly. The strings rest atop the zero fret, which is at the same height as the others, some people prefer and feel more comfortable with the zero fret slightly taller than the rest of the frets.. The zero fret functions as all the other frets do. A nut is used for spacing. When the zero fret is used the nut is cut lower than the zero fret. If you think it out the second and third and forth frets etc etc are the same height. So the zero fret can be the height of all the others.  Purpose  It is claimed that with a zero fret, the sound of an open string more closely approximates the sound of a fretted string as compared to the open string sound on a guitar with no zero fret. Countering this claim are musicians who feel that a bone or even synthetic nut will enhance the overall tone of the instrument regardless of the string being played open or fretted. Since tone is so subjective, the two claims are likely to continue perpetually. Some manufacturers that frequently use(d) a zero fret are Gretsch, Kay, Selmer, H√∂fner, Mosrite, Framus, Vox, Vigier, Harley Benton and bass guitar manufacturer MTD. Now very few manufacturers use this design and those who do list it as a feature. Steinberger uses a zero fret with their headless guitars but omit the nut; strings are mounted in place where the head would normally be, so there is no need for the string guides that the nut provides.Steinberger headstock, Image demonstrates lack of a nut. 2015 model year Gibson guitars incorporate a zero fret in order to accommodate a brass adjustable nut, which the manufacturer claims causes better sustain and intonation.  Drawbacks  Low string action (distance between string and fret wire) results from a non-elevated zero fret when using same fingerboard fret wire size. On some guitars it may be necessary to raise the bridge saddle height for a small amount.  Advantages  A large number of different gauges of strings can be used. Strings reside on top of the zero fret regardless of thickness, and have the same distance travel down to the first fret. If you have cut the grooves into the nut for thick strings, it may be necessary to change the nut out completely in order to go back to lighter gauge strings. On zero fret, this isn't needed. A conventional nut made of relatively soft plastic or bone will easily clamp the string and make fine tuning difficult. The clamping effect does not only result from too narrow nut slots, but notably more from the impression of the string windings into the nut material at the bottom of the slot. That effect is more prevalent with wire wound nylon strings than with steel strings. Using a zero fret relieves the pressure from the nut material and the nut serves only to center the strings sideways. Tuning is smooth and without sudden movement and intonation jumps. There are only a few manufacturers making metal (bronze)conventional nuts which avoid the string clamping effect.  Elevated and Straight Zero Fret  Checking for zero fret height. When the zero fret is viewed as an extension of the fingerboard by adding one more fret wire before the nut, then the luthier would fit a fret wire of identical dimensions. This will decrease the string action at the lower fret positions. To avoid this effect, luthiers often use a thicker fret wire at the zero fret position. While the straight and level zero fret improves the tuning accuracy along the lower frets (from fret 1 to 3 mainly) the elevated fret keeps the string action higher and helps to avoid string buzz.  Intonation Issues  Guitar with nut. Guitar w. zero fret. The term \\"guitar intonation\\" denotes to what precision the ideal equally tempered musical scale can be produced by a guitar, while \\"piano intonation\\" refers to the setup procedure of the individual hammers in the piano keyboard. A conventional nut or an elevated zero fret will cause pitch errors on the lower frets due to the increased pressure on the strings. The fret distances would have to be corrected for that increased tension effect, but with guitars that is not common. On the contrary the \\"level\\" zero fret will have no pitch errors on the fingered notes. This can be demonstrated by measuring the pitch deviation of each single note on the fingerboard. Players who frequently use the lower frets from 0 to 5 will benefit most from a zero fret. Using mainly the upper range of the fingerboard neutralizes the advantage of the zero fret and conventional nuts are equally suited. Those players usually avoid playing first and second fret positions because of the pitch problems there. For beginners a zero fretted guitar is preferable. Most guitars nowadays are manufactured with rather high string action and high conventional nuts. The user is expected to adjust nut height to their personal playing style. Unfortunately sales personnel in music stores DO know about that, but lack the skill and often skilled luthiers are not within reach; not to mention the extra time and/or cost to properly set up a guitar in what has become very price competitive, low profit product. Guitars with zero frets would be helpful in that situation. High nut. The photograph shows a high conventional nut on a factory made Japanese concert guitar and may serve to illustrate the necessity for evaluating the advantages and the drawbacks of modern guitar manufacturing. The high string tension makes the instrument almost unplayable for beginner students, especially for children, and additionally serves to spoil the ear training for harmonies and tone intervals due to intonation errors. Luthier intervention is required in such cases. High string action at the nut is often preferred to avoid string buzz with heavy playing style. The lower fret area is therefore out of tune. A partial solution is to apply nut corrections by reducing the distance from the nut to fret one for a small amount and then re-tune the now shorter string.

It is a disease that can destroy a large proportion of a barley crop. Loose smut replaces grain heads with smut, or masses of spores which infect the open flowers of healthy plants and grow into the seed, without showing any symptoms. Seeds appear healthy and only when they reach maturity the following season is it clear that they were infected. Systemic fungicides are the major control method for loose smut.  Hosts and symptoms  The major symptom of loose smut is the \\"smutted\\" grain heads, which contain masses of black or brown spores where the grain would normally be. The spores completely replace the grain head so that there is no grain to be harvested on infected plants. It may be possible to identify infected plants in the field before they reach the flowering stage by looking for plants which are taller and more mature than the rest of the field. The fungus causes infected plants to grow slightly taller and mature slightly sooner than the uninfected plants in the field. Since it must infect through the open florets, this gives the fungus a competitive advantage by allowing it to fall down to the healthy plants and ensuring that the fungus has a little extra time to produce and disperse spores before the florets of the healthy plants open. Ustilago nuda infects barley 'Hordeum vulgare L.' but there are many strains of Ustilago which infect many different cereal crops in a similar manner. Ustilago tritici, for example, is loose smut of wheat. Disease cycle The disease cycle of loose smut begins when teliospores are blown to open flowers and infect the ovary either through the stigma or directly through the ovary wall. There are multiple mating types for Ustilago spp. so infection will only occur if two compatible mating types are present in the same flower. After landing in an open floret, the teliospores give rise to basidiospores. Without dispersing to any alternate host plant, the basidiospores germinate right where they are. The hyphae of two compatible basidiospores then fuse to establish a dikarytic stage. After germination inside the ovary, the fungal mycelia invade the developing embryo in the seed. The fungus stays alive in the seed until the next growing season, when it is planted along with the seed. As the developing plant grows, the fungus grows with it. Once it's time for the flowers to form, teliospores are produced in place of the flowers and develop where the grain would be. Plants which are infected with Ustilago spp. actually grow taller and flower earlier than their healthy counterparts. This gives the infected plants an advantage in that the flowers of uninfected plants are more physically and morphologically susceptible to infection. The teliospores in the smutted grain heads disperse to the open flowers of the healthy plants, and the cycle continues.  Environment  Loose smut is unique in that it needs to infect the seed in the previous growing season in order to be a pathogen of the plant in the current growing season. This means that regardless of environmental conditions, if an infected seed is planted as long as the growing conditions are good for the plant, they will be good for the fungus. However, if there are environmental stressors on the plant such as drought or extreme heat, the plant will be more susceptible to injury because of the added stress from the fungal infection. If the plant doesn't survive to its reproductive stage, the fungus will not get to reproduce either. Environment becomes a factor once teliospores have been produced and are ready for dispersal. In order to get to the open flowers of healthy plants, the teliospores must be moved by wind or rain or possibly insects. If dry, calm conditions persist for the entire time the flowers are open, the infection rate will be low. Wind and moderate rain, as well as cool temperatures (16‚Äì22 ¬∞C) are ideal for the dispersal of spores. Conditions in Eastern Europe, Western Siberia, and the Northern Caucasus regions are some of the most conducive to loose smut.  Control  The most widely used method of control for loose smut is using treated seed. Seeds are typically treated with a systemic fungicide to kill any fungus that may be inside. Since the fungus grows up with the plant, it's very important that the fungicide used to treat the seed be systemic and not just external. The most common type of systemic fungicides used for loose smut are from the Carboxin group of chemicals. Although carboxins are highly toxic to fish and mildly toxic to other animals, they degrade rapidly in the environment and since there the fungicide is coated on seed and not sprayed there is not much loss to the environment. Barley varieties with resistance to loose smut are also commercially available. Although technology is being researched and used to help speed the process of resistant variety development, these traditional breeding methods are still very slow, and it is difficult to develop varieties with resistance which also possess other desirable traits such as those for yield and grain quality. Another option is heat treating the seed to kill the fungus before planting, but this is a delicate process because too much heat will kill the plant embryo and not enough will allow the fungus to survive. Research has also been done to use radio frequency heating to treat seed.  Importance  If uncontrolled, loose smut can wipe out entire crops, since it replaces the grain. In areas where people depend on their grain crops for survival and don't have the money or technology resources to control it, the disease can be devastating. Not only does it wipe out the crop, growers cannot even try again next year since any seeds they were able to harvest will be infected and will not produce seed the following season. Loose smut has recently become a more serious problem in the Ladakh region in the Himalayan mountains of India. This area has been particularly affected by global climate change and has experienced many new crop pests and diseases because of it. Barley is an important staple crop in this region and although loose smut is not the most prevalent disease of barley in the region, it has the potential to develop into a more serious problem in coming years. In places like the United States where there are ample resources and technologies such as fungicide seed treatment, loose smut is not an especially important disease.

He also was a member of the Oklahoma Outlaws in the United States Football League. He played college football at the University of California, Los Angeles. Early years At age 15, Herrera's family moved to the United States from Guadalajara, Mexico. He attended La Puente High School and practiced soccer with no knowledge about football, until he was spotted kicking a basketball into a soccer goal. He eventually joined the football team, playing as a placekicker and safety. He also lettered in baseball, wrestling and track. College career Herrera accepted a football scholarship from UCLA where he was a placekicker for the football team and a forward/midfielder for the soccer team. In 1971, Herrera became a starter and against the University of Washington, he set the school record for made field goals (4) in one game. In the opening game of the 1972 season, he kicked the game-winning field goal, with 20 seconds left, in the 20‚Äì17 upset of two-time defending national champion Nebraska. In 1973, he broke the school's PATs attempted (64) and made (61) record. In 1974, he led the nation in kick scoring (84 points). During Herrera's career, the UCLA Bruins football team regularly finished among the leaders in the nation in scoring, which helped him leave as the school and NCAA career leader in scoring with 368 points (1971-1974). He also set the 7 career records including PATs attempted (127) and made (121). The UCLA soccer team also made it to the NCAA Finals in 1972 and 1973 while Herrera was a player, losing both years to Saint Louis. Professional career=Detroit Lions Herrera was selected by the Detroit Lions in the seventh round (169th overall) of the 1974 NFL Draft. He was also selected in the third round by the Los Angeles Aztecs of the NASL Draft. He is distinguished as being the second Mexican born player to be drafted into the National Football League (Tom Fears was the first one). He was waived on September 12. Dallas Cowboys On October 3, 1974, the Dallas Cowboys signed Herrera as a free agent after kicker Toni Fritsch was lost for the season with a knee injury and Mac Percival made 2 out of 8 field goal attempts in the first 3 games. The next year, he was lost with a knee injury in pre-season and was placed on the injured reserve list. In 1976, Herrera competed with Fritsch to regain his starting job in pre-season and tied for the league lead in field goal percentage with 78.3%. He also became proficient doing \\"pooch kicks\\" (punts from field goal formation). In 1977, Herrera made 18 out of 29 field goals, 39 extra points (tied for the league lead), was the second leading scorer (93 points) in the NFL, had a career-long 52-yard field goal against the Washington Redskins and tied the league record for most field goals attempted (5) in a game. He was an All-Pro selection and made the 1978 Pro Bowl at the end of the season. He also helped the Cowboys win Super Bowl XII. On August 14, 1978, Herrera was traded to the Seattle Seahawks in exchange for a fifth round draft choice (#128-Curtis Anderson), because of a contract holdout. He left with the top career field goal percentage in franchise history (.677). The Cowboys replaced him with Rafael Septi√©n. Seattle Seahawks In 1978, he underwent appendectomy surgery following the 15th game of the season and came back the next week against the Kansas City Chiefs to make a 31-yard field goal and 2 out of 3 extra points. In Seattle he became a fan favorite as part of a special teams unit that was known for its fake field goal plays, where he had to pass, catch, block and run. In 1979, he recorded a career high 100 points and was third in the league with an 82.6% field goal percentage. The next year, he set club and career records for most field goals in a season (20) and in a game (4). In 1981, he made a career-long 54-yard field goal. He was placed on the injured reserve list with a knee injury on November 16. He was waived in favor of rookie Norm Johnson on September 8, 1982. Buffalo Bills On September 20, 1982, Herrera was signed by the Buffalo Bills to replace Nick Mike-Mayer during the strike abbreviated season (playing only 7 games). He was released on July 11, 1983. At the time he ranked second all-time in career field goal accuracy with 67.8%. Los Angeles Raiders In July 1983, Herrera was signed by the Los Angeles Raiders, but he could not pass Chris Bahr on the depth chart and was cut on August 16. Chicago Blitz (USFL) On January 25, 1984, Herrera was signed by the Chicago Blitz of the United States Football League. He was released on February 24.

The Record (Perth, W.A.), 29 April 2004, p.6-7 In 1994 he addressed the National Press Club, talking about the release of the new Catholic Catechism. During his tenure as archbishop, Hickey is credited with the significant physical change achieved through the re-building and completion of St Mary's Cathedral, Perth. On attaining retirement age of 75 years in April 2011, Hickey tendered his resignation as archbishop to Pope Benedict XVI, which was accepted on 20 February 2012 when Hickey's successor, Timothy Costelloe, was announced. Hickey is Knight Commander with Star and Grand Prior of the Lieutenancy of Australia Western of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre. Public stances Hickey has challenged secularisation tendencies in the community. As an example, in 2010 he publicly questioned the lack of religious orientation of Julia Gillard, not long after her appointment as Prime Minister of Australia. He claimed that her atheism may cost her votes. =Stem cell research= On 5 June 2007 Hickey made a controversial statement by saying that if the Western Australian members of parliament who identified as Catholic did not oppose the Human Reproductive Technology Amendment Bill, which would allow expansion of stem cell research, then they could be refused holy communion or face excommunication as a last resort. Catholic and non-Catholic members of parliament criticised Hickey for this stance. Hickey reportedly said that he did not consider that he had made a threat. He also later said that he would not refuse communion. Theological writing After a holiday in Jerusalem in the mid-2000s Hickey authored a book, Living Biblically, that encouraged a return to the use and reading of the bible. Hickey chose the title based on an article in The Tablet where the author had written about his experience of the charismatic movement in the United Kingdom. In separate writings, Hickey shows his support and encouragement of the charismatic movement. Honours Hickey was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) in 1982 for service to the community. In 1998, Pope John Paul II named him Relator Generalis for the Oceania Synod in Rome. The government of Western Australia appointed Hickey to the Homeless Persons' Advisory Committee and the Western Australia Ethnic Affairs Advisory Committee.

The Firebrand is a fantasy historical novel by Debra A. Kemp and first published by Amber Quill Press. It is the first in The House of Pendragon series. It was followed by The Recruit published in January 2007. Plot summary King Arthur, the Pendragon, lies dead after the Battle of Camlann. Lin, his only child by his queen, Gwenhwyfar, is one of five remaining members of the Round Table. Civil strife has laid waste to the unified Britain forged during Arthur's reign. In Lin's warrior persona she suppresses her gender. Through years of habit, she presents an outward calm for the soldiers who have come to accept a woman's presence and command in the army. To be an effective fighting unit, they cannot be distracted by her gender either. Lin tells the men of her half- brother, Modred's defeat and that her father has been taken to a place of healing. Beneath her stoic facade, she is torn by grief and self-doubt. She knows a mere handful of men still live who would support her claim as Arthur's heir. In her mind, it is not enough. In her mind, she is unworthy to follow in her father's wake. She denies her birthright and does not return to Camelot. Twelve years pass in restless wandering. Nightmares of Camlann and of a past that she has kept hidden continue to plague her thoughts and dreams. She is now married to GAHERIS (RIS), her father's nephew, by whom she has borne three children; BEAR (ARTHUR), MELORA, and GERNIE, with a fourth child expected. Her children are unaware of their mother's true identity as the Pendragon's daughter. The family at last camps in the shadow of Camelot. The homecoming is at once difficult and joyous. Lin's secret gnaws at her mind constantly. The children are excited and curious, having heard countless tales of Camelot from their uncle, DAFYDD. While exploring the deserted fortress of Camelot, Bear questions his mother and forces her to realize he is ready for the truth. Yet she does not reveal this immediately. Instead, Lin relates her childhood as a slave in QUEEN MORGAUSE's holding of DUNN NA CARRAICE in the distant kingdom of Orkney, before she learned the truth of her birth and her own royalty. Once begun, the catharsis must run its course. Lin's earliest memories are of sorrow and hardship. At five years old, the only mother she knows dies, leaving Lin alone with Dafydd, the boy she believes is her true elder brother. She hides the pain of abandonment from others and establishes her lifelong pattern of self-denial and internalization. While at work, Lin often watches the royal family. She especially enjoys Orkney's princes sparring in the practice yard. Prince Modred, the youngest, gains her sympathy when she sees the cruel jokes his older brothers play on him. She even comes to the prince's aid. Modred resents anyone knowing of his weak moments. That a mere slave witnesses two of those moments is not to be tolerated or forgiven. Dafydd is proud his sister displays such compassion. He feels duty-bound to take care of Lin after his mother's death. During the next few years, he hones his skills as a story-teller. His tales of Camelot's honor ease many of the horrors of slavery which surround him and his sister. Then he receives his leather slave's collar, a coming of age \\"gift\\" from Queen Morgause, their mistress. Their owner. The event shatters Lin's fragile peace with her lot in life. Questions of the established order form in Lin's mind. She rejects her brother's slavery to the point of a futile attack on the overseer. She is given a small taste of the lash as a lesson. Dafydd is far more accepting of their situation than Lin. He finds it better to survive with as few scars as possible. Lin's beating breaks his heart. He tries to dissuade her rebellion while tending her wounds later that night. For two years, he seems successful. At best, Lin's calm is temporary. On Lin's twelfth birthday, she is collared like so many slave before had been. She also gains Prince Modred as her master. The prince is now seventeen. He has recently been told by his mother that his father is the celebrated Arthur Pendragon and that Lin is his half- sister, his father's legitimate child. She stands in his way to the throne. She is the same slave who helped him escape the outhouse his brothers had locked him inside of a few years ago. She heard his screams, she must know his fears. Years of competition with his older brothers and warrior training have set the pattern of violence in Modred. He has never held any sort of power in Dunn na Carraice. He has ultimate power over Lin. Lin only knows and reacts according to her instincts. The blood of kings flows through her veins. Far from subduing Lin‚Äîas Morgause hopes‚Äîslavery brings out Lin's strengths. She resists her collar, refusing to use the word \\"master\\" or bend her knees in subservience. For her open rebellion against the collar, Modred has Lin flogged, enjoying the sight of her pain. Afterwards, he rapes her to further prove his mastery over his possession. Again, Dafydd cares for his sister. He does not understand her defiance. He wants her to accept reality. They are slaves and can do nothing to change that fact. One thing he does know about Lin is her need for his stories about Camelot. He redoubles his efforts. To Lin, Camelot is a beacon of hope and of equality‚Äîthings Dunn na Carraice and her life lack. Prince Modred treats her like a beast, branding her as his property. He embodies the inequality she despises. Each fuels the passions of the other. While outwardly continuing her resistance, the intensity of the punishments she endures take their toll on her body and her mind. Lin begins to believe in her unworthiness to be loved and to love in return. She sees herself as damaged goods no husband will ever want to touch while at the same time having no desire to ever be touched by a man again. Her sleep becomes tortured by nightmares and she does not eat, except when Dafydd presses the issue. Easily provoked by Modred, she invites the beatings in the hope the next one will bring release from her suffering through death. Lin's self- neglect grieves Dafydd, yet he admires his sister's strength of will and the courage she displays in defying Prince Modred. He has come to understand that resistance is as important to Lin as story-telling is to himself. He cannot dream of not weaving his tales. Lin's struggle reminds Dafydd, and all of Orkney's slaves, of their humanity. Dafydd becomes determined to keep his hero, his sister, alive. Obsessed with quelling his slave's spirit, Prince Modred's abuses intensify. He soon includes Dafydd in his tortures, since he knows Lin feels Dafydd's pain as her own. Lin realizes there is only one cruelty Prince Modred has left with which to break her. It is but a matter of time before he uses it. The time is brief. But through a misunderstanding in the actual order given, Lin is sent to the auction block along with her brother. She watches Dafydd displayed on the block, filled with horror and utterly defeated. Meanwhile, Modred is unaware of his moment of triumph. Lin's sale is not part of his plan. Lin loses all hope when she watches Dafydd disappear after being sold. In his memory, she goes to the block as defiant as ever and brings but a few coins for those who would profit from human flesh. She is taken to Britain's mainland in the cargo-hold of a ship laden with other souls sharing her fate. Not long after disembarking, Lin discovers that Dafydd had been on the ship also, as a cabin-boy. But the shadow of yet another auction looming in their future taints their joy of reunion. Now on foot, the slavers' destination is the northern British city of Ebrauc. Unbeknownst to the slave traders, the Pendragon is in residence in Ebrauc when they arrive on market day. King Arthur has tried to outlaw slavery in his realm, yet has been unable to stop it. Performing errands, CAI, seneschal and foster-brother to the Pendragon, passes a pavilion with an auction in progress. Curiosity leads him inside to investigate. Appalled to see children for sale, he uses his authority to halt the activity and cuts away the collars from those who have not been sold. Lin is among them. Cai notices the lean, auburn-haired girl with the bruised face and aloof stance in the midst of the others. Something about the girl draws his attention to study her more closely. Recognition sparks. She bears an uncanny resemblance to the Queen. Cai takes Lin to Arthur. Arthur also sees his wife's features in the child standing before him. After a long interview he has no doubt, the girl who says she came from Orkney is his long-missing daughter, long-believed dead. He welcomes Lin to his residence and tells her the truth of her identity.. He explains how her mother, Gwenhwyfar, did not know of the serious rift between him and his half-sister, Morgause. Gwenhwyfar only thought to send their daughter to fosterage among kin. Lin is sickened by the news that Modred is her half-brother. She tells her father of the rapes and of the child she miscarried not many days before. Furious with his half-sister and the boy he sired, Arthur wants to avenge his innocent daughter for the abuse she endured as a slave. He is willing to leave immediately for Orkney. Lin has selfish reasons for stopping her father. She views slavery as a stigma and wants it to remain secret. Public vengeance means exposure. She also realizes she cannot let her father fight her battles. When the time comes for her to confront Modred, she knows she cannot be hiding behind her father. She must face Modred alone as she has always done. Critical reaction Kathleen Cunningham Guler, author of In the Shadow of the Dragons, wrote that The Firebrand \\"skillfully blends history, legend and fiction in a story that illuminates one of the darkest corners of the Arthurian legend\\".

It began as a series of one-shots written and penciled by various writers and artists before becoming a bi- monthly ongoing series with the first issue cover-dated February 2007. Its initial writer was Sean McKeever. Each issue of Spider-Man Family contained brand new stories featuring Spider-Man and his supporting cast, reprints of classic Spider-Man tales, and an English translation of the original Japanese manga, Spider-Man J. In June 2008, Spider-Man Family was relaunched as The Amazing Spider-Man Family, and became a showcase title for many of the divergent timelines that were present at this point in the franchise. In addition to strips set in the Brand New Day timeline, a strip exploring the early days of Peter Parker's life as Spider-Man was also included. Another feature, Mr. and Mrs. Spider-Man, written by Tom DeFalco, took place within Marvel's MC2 continuity. In November 2008, Joe Quesada confirmed on his blog that cult favourite Spider-Girl would be moving to Amazing Spider-Man Family in April 2009. On July 13, 2009, Marvel announced a new monthly anthology title, Web of Spider-Man, to replace The Amazing Spider-Man Family.

Cape Breton was governed as a separate colony between 1784 and 1820, when it was merged with Nova Scotia. There have been other movements for the re-establishment of the Province of Cape Breton Island before this one but the most recent commenced in February 2000 when a meeting in Baddeck led by Scott MacLean of Sydney, Nova Scotia, was attended by about 200 Cape Bretoners seeking to form their own province or invoking some form of political change in response to an economy in crisis on the island. A subsequent meeting was held on Remembrance Day, November 11, 2000, in Sydney with about 300 attending including local officials and politicians e.g. Gerald Sampson, Kenzie MacNeil, Fraser Morrison, and Danny Hanson. The meetings also drew the attention of Senators Bernard Boudreau and Lowell Murray who raised the matter on the floor of the Canadian Senate with no decision or action being taken. The movement continued throughout 2000 and 2001 with Cape Breton University hosting a series of meetings. CBU's initiative set forth that one of the initial steps in the process of greater independence and self-reliance for Cape Breton Island is to look at the jurisdictional power held within CBI's Municipal Governments and find ways to augment and leverage it for economic growth. To that end the Cape Breton Island Branch of the North Atlantic Island Program [NAIP(CBI)], hosted by the Community Economic Development (CED) Institute, held meetings at Cape Breton University over the year focusing on the relationship between jurisdictional authority and self-reliant economic development. The meetings were attended by local leaders and politicians including; Wendy MacDonald, Vince MacLean, Dr. Gertrude MacIntyre, Director, CED Institute, Mayor Billy Joe MacLean, Donnie Rowe, John R MacDonald, Craig Pollett, Bill Stirling, Scott Dawe, and John Whalley. During 2001‚Äì2002 discussions and meetings on the topic of Cape Breton Island's governance continued and the Cape Breton Regional Municipality led by Mayor John Morgan commissioned Memorial University of Newfoundland to independently study the governance and economic crisis on Cape Breton Island for problem identification and a possible solution set. The study by Dr. Wade Locke and Dr. Stephen Tomblin was completed October 21, 2003. The study found that the depopulation and de-economization of Cape Breton Island would continue if the status quo was maintained. The study indicated that Cape Breton Island is paying the Province of Nova Scotia based on the 2002 fiscal year an excess of $12 million annually in taxation versus the expenditures it receives in return from Nova Scotia. In May 2005 a further study supporting governance and economic issues on Cape Breton Island was completed by Dr.Paul Hobson (Department of Economics, Acadia University), Dr. David Cameron (Department of Political Science, Dalhousie University) and Dr. Wade Locke (formerly of Memorial University), entitled \\"A Question of Balance‚ÄîAn Assessment of the State of Local Government in Nova Scotia\\", Union of Nova Scotia Municipalities Report, May 24, 2005. In response to the findings of these studies Mayor John Morgan and Cape Breton Regional Municipality (Cape Breton Island's largest municipal government) commenced discussions and negotiations with the Province of Nova Scotia which after failure by Nova Scotia to recognize CBRM's complaints resulted in the filing of a lawsuit by CBRM against the Province of Nova Scotia for what it claims are arbitrary and capricious fiscal improprieties‚Äîto the tune of $12 million per year. In November 2006 the popular support for the movement was rekindled by Mark Macneill of Mabou, Nova Scotia, who responded to federal House of Commons' Qu√©b√©cois nation motion recognizing \\"that the Qu√©b√©cois form a nation within a united Canada\\" by advocating that Cape Breton Island is also irrefutably a distinct society and as such should be recognized as a province within a province with a devolutionary view to re-establishing the island as its own independent province and as the 11th province within Canada. Prominent members of the community have come out in support of the movement including former Mayor John W. Morgan, Kenzie MacNeil, Anna Curtis-Steele, Maury McCrillis, Brian Joseph, PhD.

Ward (September 13, 1846 ‚Äì August 25, 1922) was an American rower and coach best known for his time as the coach of the University of Pennsylvania rowing team. Ward was a member of one of the most famous families, the Ward Brothers, in the history of the sport of rowing and is a member of the Rowing Hall of Fame. Early life Ellis Ward was born in Newburgh, New York on September 13, 1846, the son of Isaac and Winifred Ward. Ellis Ward grew up in a large family of rowing enthusiasts. Ellis Ward and his eight brothers rowed regularly in the Hudson River's Newburgh Bay from the 1850s through the 1870s. Championship rower At age 17, Ellis took up competitive racing soon he joined three of his brothers (Ellis, Henry, Josh and Gilbert) to race as a team; included in their many wins included the 1865 professional four-oared championship of America with a hard-fought victory over the Biglin Brothers. They also won a and a world title in 1871 at Saratoga when Ellis and his brothers defeated two English and three American fours man boats in an international four mile turn race. Coaching career Ellis Ward first position in college coaching was in 1873 at Amherst College. This was one of many teams he coached during the 1870s and 1880s including a number of non- collegiate boat clubs, including the Columbia Boat Club in Washington, D.C., the Fairmount Boat Club of Philadelphia, and the Bohemian Boat Club of New York City. In 1879, Ellis Ward began coaching crew at Penn position he would hold off and on until 1912. In 1887 Ward resigned for the season because of controversy over the stroke he trained his athletes to use, but he returned the following season. Ward was replaced for the 1897 season by Samuel Powel, Jr. Substitution controversy Ward continued to coach Penn until 1892. Before the college championship of America, he felt the varsity was not giving their best efforts. Ward removed the entire varsity crew and the second string of eight rowers. Wards team of substitutes won the college championship of America, on Saratoga Lake. This controversy may have had something to do with his departure from Penn at about that time. Another factor may have been the University was starting to take over the funding and oversight of Penn athletics. Whatever the reason George Washington Woodruff became coach of both football and crew. Return to Penn From 1892 until 1895 Ward was also absent for a four-year period when he trained rowers at the Manhattan Athletic Club in New York City. Woodruff did not have enough time to supervise both sports and Ward was hired by the University in 1896. Henley The highlight of Ward's long tenure as coach was Penn's trip to 1901 at Henley Regatta. Ward had to change its strategy since the Penn Crew had to row a far shorter distance than they were used to. Ward's eight oared crew still won both of its trial heats at the regatta, but lost in the final to the Leander Club crew of London, England. That year, they were the only American eight man crew to mount a serious challenge to Britain's retention of the Grand Challenge Cup, the most prized trophy in amateur rowing. After coaching Ward left his position as rowing coach in 1912. He supported himself and his wife Martha by working with his son making oars. Ellis Ward died in Philadelphia on August 25, 1922.

The verses of azhwars are compiled as Nalayira Divya Prabandham and the 108 temples revered are classified as Divya desam. Mathurakavi is considered the sixth in the line of the twelve azhwars. He was the disciple of Nammazhwar, considered the greatest among the twelve azhwars and his contributions amount to 11 among the 4000 stanzas in the Nalayira Divya Prabandam. Mathurakavi is believed to have recorded and compiled the works of Nammazhwar namely, Thiruvaymozhi (1102 verses). One can say that the 11 verses of Kanninun Siru Thambu composed by Swami Madhurakavi Alvar can be considered as the key which opened the treasure to the 4000 verses of Nalayira Divya Prabandham. These verses were chanted by Swami Nathamuni 12,000 times to propitiate Swami Nammazhwar and re-obtain the lost Nalayira Divya Prabandham from Swami Nammazhwar. As per Hindu legend, Nammazhwar remained speechless from his birth sitting in a tamarind tree and he first interacted with Madhurakavi, who saw a bright light shining to the south, and followed it until he reached the tree where the boy was residing. The works of Madhurakavi along with the other azhwars contributed to the philosophical and theological ideas of Vaishnavism. The verses of Mathurakavi and other azhwars are recited as a part of daily prayers and during festive occasions in most Vishnu temples in South India. AlvarsEarly life Madhura Kavi aazhwar was born before Nammazhwar, in a Brahmin family, in the month of Chittirai and in chitra star in Thirukkolur near Azhwar Thirunagari.B.S. 2011, p. 45Das 2005, p. 29 The presiding deity in the temple is called Vaitha Maanidhi, meaning the storage of great wealth. He is believed to be the divine form of Kumudha Ganesa, the disciple of Vishwaksena, a servant of Vishnu. He is also believed to be the incarnation of Garuda, the sacred eagle vehicle of Vishnu.Dalal 2011, p. 227 Madhura Kavi is believed to have learnt the Vedas and considered well-versed in both Tamil and Sanskrit. He used to compose poems in the praise of Vishnu. At one stage in his life, he decided to abandon all the chains of livelihood and strive towards moksha. In this pursuit he undertook a pilgrimage to the divya desam located in northern India like Ayodhya and Mathura. Meeting Nammazhwar When Madhura Kavi aazhwar, after long tour had reached Ayodhya and completed the mangalaasasanam of the enchanting forms of Rama, Sita, Lakshmana, Hanuman and others, he noticed a glowing ball of fire in the sky. However much he tried, he could not understand the reason for this phenomenon. He also noticed that the ball of fire started moving southwards. He decided to follow the light which led him to Aazhwar Thirunagari and finally disappeared. Madhurakavi already heard about a sixteen-year-old youth [Nammalvar] who spent his life since birth under a Tamarind tree without eating anything and emitting a divine glow. Madhurakavi proceeded straight to the seat of Nammalvar who was in a trance. In order to test Nammalvar, Madhurakavi dropped a stone. Unable to elicit any reaction from the child, he asked him a riddle: \\"If the small is born in a dead's body (or stomach), what will it eat and where will it stay?\\" meaning, if the subtle soul is embodied in the gross body, what are its actions and thoughts? Nammalvar broke his lifelong silence and responded, \\"That it will eat, it will rest!\\" meaning that if the soul identifies with the body, it will be the body but if it serves the divine, it will stay in vaikunta and eat(think) of God. Getting two important idols When Nammalvar was ready to go to vaikunta loka (attaing Salvation), Madhurakavi asked Nammalvar with full of tears what to do next. Nammalvar advised Madhurakavi to boil the waters of Tamraparni and he said that an idol will form during boiling of the water. Madhurakavi did as per Nammalvar's advice. When he had boiled the waters of Tamraparni, He got an idol of Bhagavad Ramanuja. He was surprised to see that the idol was different from what he had expected. He went to Nammalvar with the idol and the latter told him that this idol was Bhavishyadhacharya (Future Guru) and that he will be born 4000 years from then. He again advised to boil the waters of Tamraparni. Madhurakavi once again boiled the waters of Tamraparni and finally got the idol of Nammalvar. Works The eleven verses of Madhurakavi are classified as Kanninum Chiruthambu, all of which are in four lines in praise of his divine teacher, Nammazhwar. The verses are compiled as Nalayira Divya Prabandam along with the work of the other eleven azhwars. Mathurakavi was instrumental in spreading the works of Nammazhwar and composing tunes to each of them. The verses begin with \\"The name of the great one, my acharya of Kurukoor, brings nectar to my tongue and far sweeter than the name of the Lord\\". It is believed that Madhurakavi compiled and codified all the verses of Tiruvaimozhi by Nammazhwar as he recited them.Ramaswamy 2007, p. 211 NotesReferences  * Vaishnava saints Alvars Bhakti movement ","title":"Madhurakavi Alvar"},{"id":"9601603","text":"KRRZ (1390 AM, \\"Classic Hits 1390\\") is a classic hits radio station in Minot, North Dakota, owned by iHeartMedia through licensee iHM Licenses, LLC.

Hossaini describes the genesis of the project in Robert Wilson Video Portraits, an edited volume published by ZKM. In a separate interview for HD TV Technology Hossaini noted that his early adoption of HD video in the production of Wilson's portrait enabled the conscious evolution of the video art to be consumer akin to other art forms such as painting. \\"The other idea of the video portrait is to do a very playful extension of the painting. Wilson is noted for very, very slow movement in all of his theater and film work that he has done before. In this case, he wanted to create these things that almost look like a still life on the wall, but then they started gradually to move. The more you watch them, the more you see in terms of that movement. They sit up on your wall as permanent installations, so video is the perfect medium for this kind of exercise.\\" Greg Moyer of Voom HD Networks would go on to comment that this production \\"brought Robert Wilson to high definition in some regards. He'd been using the medium prior, but we facilitated every aspect of the portraits.\\" The establishment of Pantar Productions (2009-2011) In 2009 Hossaini expanded his independent consulting and production activity under the umbrella of Pantar Productions. From 2009-2011 he produced content for clients that included NHK, High Fidelity HDTV, The Submarine Channel Submarine Channel - Interactive Storytelling and Indieflix, amongst others.

Hossaini also produced Epitaph an autobiographical short directed by Dennis Hopper shortly before his death. Through Pantar Productions Hossaini realised the first iteration his Ouroboros: The History of The Universe art installation at the Ise Cultural Foundation Ise Cultural Foundation in Soho, New York. In a review for The New York Times Dennis Overbye remarked that the work \\"bypass the rational part of the brain and head[s] straight for someplace deeper, to make us experience the universe not as a concatenation of forces but as a poem.\\" Ouroboros would set a trend for much of Hossaini's subsequent artistic and professional activity, ostensibly exploring how art and technology can, in his words (2016), \\"help facilitate a shift from authentic objects to authentic experiences.\\" Luminaria (2012-2014) In 2012 Hossaini was approached by the City of San Antonio to develop a five-year strategic plan to transform their Lumniaria Arts festival into a globally significant festival of arts and ideas. Hossaini's preliminary plan developed with Dissident Industries, a New York-based firm, would be to alternate the festival annually with a workshop or ‚Äúa participatory lab for festival development and experimentation.‚Äù. The plan advocated the expansion of the new biannual event into a ten-day festival and was credited with aligning the festival with downtown development initiatives and the city's strategic ambitions. In a 2014 interview Hossaini commented that the goal was to convert Luminaria from a ‚Äúby San Antonio, for San Antonio‚Äù event into a ‚Äúby San Antonio, for San Antonio, and for the rest of the world‚Äù The president of the Luminaria board credited the report with a helping to instigate paradigm shift for the organisation ‚Äì \\"Living event to event isn‚Äôt working,.. Now we‚Äôre talking about Luminaria as a concept, as an organization (instead of a once-a- year event)\\" Cinema Arts Network (2011-2017) In 2011 Hossaini became CEO of CAN: Cinema Arts Network, a UK-based consortium of cinemas and art centers funded by the BFI. The company launched with a live broadcast of the London Symphony Orchestra from the Barbican Centre. Cinema Arts Network completed a national broadband \\"Network for the arts\\" in 2014, and in 2015 Hossaini announced CAN 2.0, an initiative to engage audiences via smartphones in sixteen UK arts venues. Art for Tomorrow Hossaini remarked at the Johannesberg Summit of Global Congress of the Wireless Broadband Alliance technological convergence allows initiatives like this Cinema Arts Network to proflierate, nothing that connectivity alone is a \\"transformative factor that catalyses transformative changes in society.\\" Manual of Digital Museum Planning In 2017, Hossaini published the Manual of Digital Museum Planning which the publisher, Rowman & Littlefield, describe as the comprehensive guide to digital planning, development, and operations for museum professionals and students of museums studies and arts administration. King's College Since 2017 Hossaini has been Visiting Research Fellow in the Department of Informatics at King's College London. In 2019 he co-founded National Gallery X, a joint research studio maintained by the National Gallery and King's College London. In 2020 Hossaini was promoted to Visiting Senior Research Fellow in the Department of Engineering at King's College London. In this capacity, he serves as co-director of National Gallery X, and his responsibilities include curating and collaborating with studio residents and building creative links between the Gallery and King's College London researchers. =Connected Culture= In 2016 Ericsson and King's College London announced that Hossaini would lead Connected Culture, a joint project that applies 5G networking techniques to immersive media. Connected Culture examined how vision, hearing and touch perform over 5G networks. Public workshops were held at National Theatre Studio, RADA and Sadler's Wells, and Hossaini tested a new spatial audio system Soundscapes within his 3D video installation Ouroboros. As a result of Hossaini's project in June 2018 the city of London announced they would be hosting the world's first 5G connected theatre in collaboration with Berlin. The project report contains details on how to manage art-science collaborations and reports on perceptual tolerances to network faults. With the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 Ericsson explored work of the connected culture initiative noting the way that well before an event like COVID-19 the Hossaini's vision \\"had the ambition to show how the three sensory elements of touch, sight and sound could be heightened to make any experience much more immersive.\\". In a virtual panel as a part of the Ericsson UnBoxed Office social series, ‚Äú5G: Connecting Culture‚Äù, Hosseini noted that with 5G, independent artists will have the same kind of access that major cultural institutions do and suggested that this will help drive a major cultural explosion in small towns around the world as creativity is going to be one of the primary ways of maintaining connection to others.  National Gallery X  In 2019 King's College London, The National Gallery and Google Arts & Culture formally launched 'National Gallery X' (NGX), a collaborative research and development programme. Located in a hub next to the main National Gallery building, the NGX examines how technological inventions can be applied to cultural institutions in the future and inform new kinds of cultural experiences. National Gallery X (NGX) is part of an innovation lab within the Department of Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport's (DCMS) Culture is Digital policy programme. The Culture is Digital programme was launched in 2018 at the Gallery by the then Secretary of State to stimulate the relationship between the culture and technology sectors. As co-director of NGX Hossaini describes the goal of the undertaking is to \\"spark a modern renaissance\\" by bringing together people who are cross-trained artists, scientists and engineers to create \\"new forms of spatialised experience that our predecessors couldn't have dreamed of\\". National Gallery X was launched in September 2019 by Gabriele Finaldi and speakers included Tim Berners-Lee. In 2020 National Gallery X and Hossaini commissioned and released their first commission as a virtual versions of an art installation that reveals the sounds of colour in paintings virtual in response the COVID-19 pandemic. KIMA: Colour in 360 by Analema Group launched on the second of June 2020 and consists of three video works that transform colour data from Jan van Eyck's Arnolfini Portrait, Claude Monet's Water Lilies (Monet series), and Vincent van Gogh'S Wheat Field with Cypresses into 360-degree light and sound experiences. Two of these were made immediately available to view on YouTube and the National Gallery website with the van Eyck-inspired work following later. The virtual artist residency by Analema Group was a part of a revised programme that takes the lockdown as its context and subject and offers a series of creative and philosophical responses to the new world coronavirus has created. In an interview on the project Hossaini commented that the COVID-19 pandemic had radically accelerated the nature of artistic expression as well as shifted the fundamental core value propositions of museums as well as augmented their underlying architectonic logic: > Covid-19 slammed the accelerator on long-term trends. Since the 90s I‚Äôve > staked my career on convergence: the idea that the Internet will absorb > every other medium. It started with mail then print. I remember when people > said no one will watch TV on their computer let alone their phone. I prefer > making the future to predicting it, but I think the next wave of convergence > is architecture. I call KIMA: Colour in 360 a ‚Äòboundless meditation on the > essence of art‚Äô, but it is also a meditation on walls and the intersection > of physical and virtual space. During the Covid-19 lockdown, artist‚Äôs tools > have evolved at warp speed, and more importantly, so have people‚Äôs habits. > As the National Gallery and other cultural places re-open, they‚Äôll have > access to vigorous new tech that make buildings more like websites while > distributing key features of architecture over media channels. > Interactivity, personalization and other features we take for granted online > will become part of places, and distinctions between physical and virtual > will fade as architecture comes online. Subsequently, on the 16th of June 2020, the NGX launched their digital events programme in collaboration with the London media art platform Art in Flux. ‚ÄòART IN FLUX @ NGX - GENDER*UCK - Media art beyond and between concepts of Gender'  presented new-media artwork exploring the boundaries between art and technology. Speaking and presentations Hossaini is a well-known speaker on art, technology and politics. In 2015 and 2016, The New York Times invited him to present at Art for Tomorrow, and in 2017 he hosted a weekend on Democracy & Film for The New York Times at Athens Democracy Forum. In 2019 Hossaini worked with security think tank Royal United Services Institute and, to produce a special edition of its journal and assessed the threat from AI from the perspective of biology. In the text he invited essays 4 distinguished biologists who wrote detailed responses The texts surveyed the challenges AI creates for security and defence from the level of individuals to states and then the globe. The edition noted how in both creative and defence contexts AI provokes profound questions about what it means to be human and creates innumerable risks and opportunities to the current security environment. Hossaini noted in his own text that the \\"rather than from an intelligence explosion and its consequences, the potential threat may come instead from AI‚Äôs ability to acquire agency\\" Discussions and lectures 2016 = * Artificial Intelligence: Can Machines Possess Emotions?

The multi- media experience attempted to re-imagine the concert-going experience by employing interactive methods to explore the relationship between performers and observers, the limits of the human voice, and the possibilities of music and image. Hossaini writes that he began working on the performance in 2006 and it was irrevocably formed by the experience of being with his mother as she died. As a result, the performance can be interpreted as imagining his mother's passage from life to death: > \\"It is a cycle of artworks where each version involves composers, > performers, designers and

which is often found growing on dead, hermit-crabbed shells of marine gastropod species. This hydroid species is also commonly known as snail fur, a name which refers to the furry appearance that the hydroids give to a shell. In the northwestern Atlantic, these hydroids are especially common on the outside of shells that are occupied by the flat-clawed hermit crab. Description Hydractinia echinata on a shell of a Common Whelk (Buccinum undatum) Hydractinia echinata forms pinkish-brown (when alive) or plain brown (when dead) patches on gastropod shells that are occupied by a hermit crab, often near the aperture of the shell.John Barrett and C M Young, Collins Pocket Guide to the Sea Shore (1958) p.48 The horny mat or hydrorhiza is about three millimetres thick. It consists of thick jagged spines that reach three millimetres in height. Amongst these there are three types of polyps. The club- like feeding polyps grow up to thirteen millimetres in length, and have two rows of eight tentacles, the lower set being shorter than the upper ones. There are also male and female reproductive polyps (gonozoids) that have a few short terminal tentacles. Scattered among these are specialized defensive stinging polyps (dactylozooids) that are long, coiled threads. The gonozoids liberate crawling planula larvae that search out moving gastropod shellsMarine Life Information Network Distribution H. echinata is found on all sides of the northern Atlantic Ocean, including the Arctic Ocean, the Saint-Lawrence Gulf, the Baltic Sea and the North Sea south to northwest Africa, as well as the Western Atlantic including the Gulf of Mexico.World Register of Marine Species It is common around the coasts of Britain and Ireland, and there it is found where hermit crabs (Eupagurus bernhardus) occur, on the lower shore on sandy substrates.

There is strong support for and against the coal mine within the Hunter Valley and other areas. The coal mine will be managed by Centennial Coal with Mines operator expected to be Thiess. The mine will provide coal mostly for the production of electricity. It currently has contracts for providing coal to Bayswater / Liddell power stations in the Upper Hunter for 12 years, commencing in 2008. Pros and cons Supporters state that the local communities exist because of mining historically attracting workers to the area and that a new mine will lead to further employment in the local area along with statewide economic benefit. Environmental activists have utilised arguments against removing current landholders, potential loss of flora and fauna diversity and climate change to argue against the mines approval. History of approval The proposed mine EA (environmental assessment) was provided to the Department of Planning in June 2006. On the 7th of June the NSW Planning Minister Frank Sartor approved the proposed mine, stating that not going ahead with the mine would make no overall difference to climate change and thus would slow down the economy of New South Wales without good reason. Additionally many local landowners where happy to accept Centennial Coals purchase offer, and further environmental surveys showed species were found in greater abundance, further afield, than protestors had stated was the case. That same year, however, the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales found, in a case initiated by environmentalist Pete Gray, that the government had failed to properly assess the greenhouse gas pollution that would be caused by the mining and subsequent use of the coal. This was described by Greenpeace as a \\"landmark case [...] that forced tougher scrutiny of coal mine emissions in Australia\\".\\"Crusader had a passion for the planet\\", Sydney Morning Herald, May 13, 2011\\"Remembering Pete Gray\\", Greenpeace Australia Pacific, May 2, 2011 Sale to Xstrata Centennial Coal announced the sale of its Anvil Hill mine in the Upper Hunter to Xstrata Coal for $425 million on Monday 17 September 2007 Xstrata Coal is seen by certain politicians as a respectable coal mine operator within the NSW and QLD communities, with former Premier of NSW Bob Carr saying in regards to the Xstrata Coal scholarships program ‚ÄúXstrata Coal‚Äôs commitment to the teacher‚Äôs scholarships is an outstanding example of good corporate citizenship in action. They have provided teachers with valuable new experiences to strengthen their professional knowledge and teaching ability. This is a direct contribution to the well being of the community in which they operate. This means teachers in NSW can be equipped with new skills that will touch the lives of hundreds of their students down the years Xstrata is also seen in a better position to undertake the operation of Anvil Hill, which is reflected in the statements made by Centinneal Coals Managing Director Robert Cameron, who said Xstrata was better placed to \\"absorb\\" the risks involved in the development of the Anvil Hill project.

It debuted at the 2007 Daytona 500, which aired on February 18 of that year. In 2007 and 2008, it was a pay-per-view subscription package. However, from 2009 to 2012, it was free for all DirecTV subscribers, and the features were noticeably downgraded. As of the 2013 season, DirecTV stopped offering the service when its sponsorship agreement with NASCAR was not renewed. History NASCAR Hot Pass debuted at the 2007 Daytona 500 on February 18. Kevin Harvick, who was seen on channel 796, was the race winner. Five channels, 795 to 799, featured different drivers, while a \\"mix\\" channel, 794, was a miniature version of each of the driver channels and links to their full screens. On the day after each race, channel 793 was used for \\"shortcuts,\\" 30-minute excerpts of the previous day's (or night's) coverage. Both options have since been eliminated. The in-car audio option was added at the UAW-DaimlerChrysler 400 on March 11. 2007‚Äì2008: pay-per-view version NASCAR Hot Pass included a view of the race from a driver's in-car camera, unedited communications between the driver, crew chief, and spotter, and telemetry showing the car's speed and horsepower. Part of the screen also included the live nationwide race broadcast, from either Fox, TNT, or ESPN. The annual price was $99 per year, paid in two monthly installments of $49.50 each. As with all other DirecTV PPV sports packages, there was expected to be an annual renewal discount for subscribers with an account in good standing. In mid-May 2007, DirecTV began offering a discounted rate of $79 for the remaining races of the season. In July, the price was slashed again, this time to $59. In each case, there were again two installments. From late August through the end of the season, the price was $19.95 for up to the final 11 races, the same price as each individual race up to that time. In 2008, DirecTV offered a special rate of $40 for the entire season for new subscribers. In 2007 and 2008, Hot Pass consisted of 10 channels between 790 and 799. The first four channels, 790 through 793, showed drivers selected by the producers and DirecTV. The drivers varied from race to race and will depend on a number of factors, including driver popularity and past performance on a given track.SpeedCouch posting, late January 2007 In addition, for some races, one driver was selected based on an online vote. For example, the 2008 Daytona 500 free preview had Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Jeff Gordon, Kevin Harvick, and Tony Stewart. During the race, viewers had the option of the live official telecast audio, the separate broadcast dedicated to the driver, and in-car communications between the driver and his team. During commercials, only the broadcast audio and in-car channel are available. Also during the breaks, race action is still available, but on a much smaller screen than at other times. The fifth channel (794) simulcasted the main broadcast and provided subscribers a choice of 12 other audio channels from the drivers not chosen otherwise. Kurt Busch, Michael Waltrip, and Carl Edwards were among the options at the free preview. Channels 795 through 799, the original Hot Pass channels, had the same features, only with high-definition video and enhanced-quality audio. HD equipment is required to access these channels. If a driver already chosen has been eliminated from the race before its conclusion, other drivers were substituted. For example, Jimmie Johnson replaced Gordon at the 2008 Daytona 500, and Denny Hamlin filled in for Stewart at the same race the year before. Also, two substitutions were made on the same channel at the 2007 Pepsi 400, also a free preview, as J.J. Yeley filled in for Harvick, who in turn substituted for Stewart. 2009‚Äì2012: free version On December 10, 2008, NASCAR and DirecTV mutually agreed to end Hot Pass as a pay-per-view package.scenedaily.com December 10, 2008 - DirecTV to change NASCAR Hot Pass For the next four seasons, the package was free to all DirecTV subscribers. The 4 driver channels (795-798) were still available and in HD, however all other features were removed.DirecTV Official Site - 2009 NASCAR Hot Pass Information The free version consisted of a split screen shot of the featured drivers' in-car cameras on one side and a simulcast of the official race coverage on the other. The simulcast included full audio, so sometimes two different audio feeds (the MRN/PRN Radio broadcast and the teams' two-way radio) are heard simultaneously. In some instances, including the red-flag delay and eventual ending to the 2009 Daytona 500, the network telecast was shown alone within a frame. Like the pay-per-view format, the in-car camera shots were commercial-free. Starting with the 2012 Pennsylvania 400 at the Pocono Raceway, it was made available exclusively to HD customers and features were removed from SD customers. No reason was publicly given, and whether it was a precursor to the eventual decision to drop the service entirely is unknown. Driver appearances and performances The following drivers were chosen for the two seasons that it was on pay-per-view: Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Jeff Gordon, Tony Stewart, Denny Hamlin, Jeff Burton, Carl Edwards, Kurt Busch, Kevin Harvick, Juan Pablo Montoya, Greg Biffle, Jimmie Johnson, Matt Kenseth, David Stremme, Mark Martin, Ryan Newman, Clint Bowyer, Dale Jarrett, Jamie McMurray, Robby Gordon, Michael Waltrip, Kasey Kahne, Dave Blaney, Reed Sorenson, J.J. Yeley, Boris Said, and Martin Truex, Jr. Earnhardt, Jr. appeared most frequently in 2007, being shown on 24 occasions. However, he was pulled from the lineup during the Chase for the NEXTEL Cup, for which he failed to qualify, after he had become a regular on almost a weekly basis, as NASCAR and DirecTV agreed to focus on the drivers that made the Chase. Seven drivers won races on the same week(s) that they were featured in that first season: Kevin Harvick (Daytona 500, NASCAR NEXTEL All-Star Challenge), Matt Kenseth (Auto Club 500), Jimmie Johnson (Kobalt Tools 500), Jeff Gordon (Aaron's 499 and UAW-Ford 500), Juan Pablo Montoya (Toyota/Save Mart 350), Tony Stewart (Allstate 400 at the Brickyard and Centurion Boats at the Glen), and Carl Edwards (Sharpie 500 and Dodge Dealers 400). Announcers in 2007 and 2008 NASCAR Hot Pass used announcers separate from the main national television broadcasts. For example, Rick Allen and Phil Parsons called the races when Dale Earnhardt, Jr. appeared on this package. Other commentators frequently heard were Wendy Venturini, Hermie Sadler, Doug Rice, Adam Alexander, and Pat Patterson. (Venturini became the first woman to call a NASCAR race when she did the lap-by-lap of Robby Gordon at the Toyota/Save Mart 350.) Steve Byrnes, Darrell Waltrip, Larry McReynolds, Brad Sham and Barry LeBrock made occasional or one-shot appearances. When Waltrip made his debut at the Pepsi 400, his signature race-beginning call of \\"boogity boogity boogity\\" was simulcast on all five channels. Mike JoyBehind the Microphone with Mike Joy, NASCAR on Fox and former WRC (Washington, D.C.) sportscaster George MichaelMichael's 'Sports Machine' going silent were also linked to reports that they will be on Hot Pass; however, they never appeared as far as is known. NASCAR iN Car NASCAR Hot Pass had similar to another service called NASCAR iN Car. NASCAR iN Car was started in 2003 by iN Demand Networks and was exclusive to digital cable subscribers for three years.iN DEMAND NETWORKS AND NASCAR ANNOUNCE 2004 SEASON OF \\"NASCAR IN CAR\\" NASCAR iN Car was discontinued after the introduction of NASCAR Hot Pass.

History  Swain began as the \\"Swain Free School\\" of New Bedford, Massachusetts in 1881 through the provisions of the will of New Bedford philanthropist William W. Swain. The following year, the school began offering courses in languages, literature, history, education, art, and chemistry free of charge to area residents who could not otherwise afford an education beyond public school. The residents were required to put down a deposit of $10 per semester as a measure of good faith. As the textile industry was increasingly important to the area, the school concentrated on instruction in textile design. In 1902, the trustees redefined the school mission as a School of Design. In the 1970s, there were only 100 students enrolled at any time The May 1970 commencement was a milestone for the school when twelve students earned their Bachelor of Fine Arts degrees, the first in Swain's history. Notable faculty included: David Loeffler Smith, John Osbourne, Severin Haines, Dick Dougherty, Russell Daly, Alphonse Mattia, Jacqueline Block, Benjamin Martinez, Jim Bobrick, Tom Corey, Nicolas Kilmer, Robin Taffler, Leo Kelly, and Marc St. Pierre. Merger with Southeastern Massachusetts University In 1988, the Swain School in New Bedford merged with Southeastern Massachusetts University's College of Visual and Performing Arts. The campus at 1213 Purchase Street was leased by the University from the City of New Bedford until 2001; all other Swain buildings were sold. In 1991, a new University of Massachusetts structure combined the Amherst, Boston, and Worcester campuses with the Southeastern Massachusetts University and the University of Lowell to form the University of Massachusetts system.

They were first produced in 1935. History As a supplement to his candy business, Mr. Sterzing developed a process by which he sliced potatoes and slow cooked them one batch at a time. The ingredients, which remain unchanged today, include only potatoes, salt and oil.www.thehawkeye.com The cooking method remains the same, as well, and produces the unique flavor and texture which has become the trademark of the chips. During World War II Mr. Sterzing began producing the chips as his primary product, due to both scarcity of chocolate (since it was sent overseas) and customer demand. Sterzing recognized that quality was his claim to fame, and he personally selected a quality control engineer, Renae Roberts, who was added to the line in order to assure uniform superiority. Ms. Roberts had a unique eye for consistency, claiming a system for spotting \\"uneven chippiness\\". She shared her concept with various proteges and her devotion to quality continues to this day. Thus the product remains true to its original roots, pleasing the legions of Sterzing's lovers worldwide. \\"Try as I might,\\" Roberts once opined, \\"I've never seen a vision on a chip....Not the virgin Mary, nor even a dolphin. But each chip is worthy of the Sterzing's name. Of that I am certain.\\"'' In 1959, Sterzing's Food Company was purchased from the founder Barney Sterzing by his cousin Warren \\"Dutch\\" Duttweiler. Today the company is still owned and operated as a family business, now in the hands of the 3rd generation. Throughout most of Southeast Iowa you can find Sterzing Brand potato chips next to the larger companies' national brands. Company growth Sterzing's ships potato chips both nationwide and worldwide. International shipping originally began during the Vietnam War when servicemen from Southeast Iowa requested the brand of chips they grew up eating. Since then international shipments have branched out and expanded with destinations as diverse as Europe, the Middle East and Egypt. With the addition of an online store within the last decade, they are able to stay a small town business while offering dedicated customers the opportunity to continue purchasing their chips from anywhere. In 1984, Sterzings began making tortilla chips, followed by a line of dips, and salsas. Until the early 1990s, Sterzings did not deliver outside of a 100 mile radius of Burlington, then, in 1993, they began to deliver across the state of Iowa, a year later, they delivered throughout the midwest.

It was produced by Travis Turk and was released in 1970 on Andy Williams's Barnaby Records label as Z 30093. A compact disc was released by Var√®se Sarabande in June 1998. Due to its limited initial appeal (it only sold a few hundred copies), long periods out of general release, and stylistic differences with the rest of Buffett's work, Down to Earth (along with the similar High Cumberland Jubilee) was often not considered part of the chronology of Buffett albums by fans or even Buffett himself. Songs All of the songs on Down to Earth were written or co-written by Buffett. \\"The Captain and the Kid\\" was re-recorded twice by Buffett‚Äîfirst for 1976's Hava√±a Daydreamin', and then for the 2002 compilation Meet Me in Margaritaville: The Ultimate Collection. The folk-rock style of music and lyrics on Down to Earth and High Cumberland Jubilee differ greatly from Buffett's subsequent output. There is less of the country music feel and little of the gulf and western, Key-West-influenced sound and themes that have defined his musical career.

As the series' opening episode, it introduces the main characters in the series, and follows Rocky (Zendaya Coleman) and CeCe (Bella Thorne) as they try out for \\"Shake It Up Chicago\\", after being encouraged by Deuce (Adam Irigoyen) and Ty (Roshon Fegan). Also in this episode, Flynn (Davis Cleveland) tries to avenge CeCe and Rocky for his breakfast. The episode premiered on the Disney Channel on November 7, 2010. It was directed by Shelley Jensen and written by series creator Chris Thompson. The episode features four original songs recorded for the series. It was watched by approximately 6.2 million viewers, becoming Disney's highest rated series premiere in the history of the channel‚Äôs run and surpassed the series premiere of Hannah Montana on March 24, 2006. The episode was also the seventh most-watched cable event on television on the Sunday it aired. Plot The episode introduces the characters of Rocky Blue (Zendaya) and CeCe Jones (Bella Thorne). They appear in a group of people waiting at a subway stop, as Rocky plays her boombox and they attempt to dance for money. They give a rousing performance, which gets everyone in the crowd dancing as well. When they are done, the performance is received with applause, however, after receiving the hat they passed around, Rocky sees that they have only earned a dime. After telling the crowd that they want money for cell phones, and an operation, they pass around the hat again, only to see that their dime is gone. \\"Start It Up\\" is one of the multiple Shake It Up episodes that reference pop singer Lady Gaga. Next, the girls get ready for school, and CeCe does her daily ritual of yelling out her apartment window for Rocky, who lives on the floor above, to get ready for school. While preparing for school, \\"Shake it Up Chicago\\" appears on television, and CeCe dances along to it. CeCe's mother, Georgia (Anita Barone), who is a police officer, and her brother Flynn (Davis Cleveland). When Georgia orders CeCe to fix breakfast for Flynn, Rocky arrives through the window, to rush CeCe to catch the subway for school. In a rush, the duo prepare a \\"one-minute breakfast\\" for Flynn, mixing his cereal in a blender and putting it in a bag. As they arrive at school, their friend Deuce (Adam Irigoyen) is introduced, offering them bootleg Lady Gaga concert tickets. He then tells them about an opportunity to audition on their favorite show, \\"Shake it Up Chicago.\\" After deciding to go to the auditions, their rivals, Gunther and Tinka Hessenheffer (Kenton Duty and Caroline Sunshine), are introduced, and they tell CeCe and Rocky their plans of trying out for the show as well. Before going to the auditions, Rocky has an impromptu dance-off with her brother, Ty (Roshon Fegan). CeCe encourages him to try out also, but he says that he \\"doesn't dance for the man.\\" Both do well in their preliminary auditions, and Rocky shines during the solo round. However, CeCe gets stage fright and ends up running off stage. Rocky finds her crying at the subway stop, embarrassed and referring to herself as a loser. When CeCe brings up how Rocky is better and names all of her good qualities, Rocky replies with things good about CeCe. CeCe then accompanies Rocky on \\"Shake it Up Chicago\\" to support her. Rocky then tries to get CeCe onstage with her, and when she refuses, Rocky uses Georgia's handcuffs to make her come and they dance onstage together. After the segment is over, the show's host, Gary Wilde (R. Brandon Johnson) decides to let CeCe join the show as well. Trying to unlock the handcuffs, Rocky realizes they are gone. Flynn took the keys in retaliation for their \\"one-minute breakfast\\" prepared for him. Production=Development The show was ordered up as Disney's attempt in its first female buddy show, but with a dance-driven aspect. Initially carrying the working title Dance, Dance Chicago, the original description was described as the journey of two kids on a contemporary American Bandstand-type show. Veteran television producers Chris Thompson and Rob Lotterstein were assigned to work on the story. Casting for the show began in October 2009. Bella Thorne and Zendaya were cast as the two female leads, as well as Camp Rock cast member Roshon Fegan in a co-lead role. President of Disney Entertainment, Gary Marsh said the Thorne/Zendaya duo were the most engaging best friends they had seen on the network. On what makes the show different, Marsh said \\"while buddy comedies have been around since the start of television,\\" that \\"this is the first time anyone has incorporated dancing into the underlying premise of a sitcom.\\" The concept of the show has been noted to be very similar to that of fellow Disney Channel series Hannah Montana, and according to The Sun-Sentinel, Shake It Up is the same approach with dance. Additionally, the show is Disney's second series to have a show-within-a-show following \\"So Random\\" in Sonny with a Chance. Chuck Barney of the Contra Costa Times said that the show's plots \\"play out in typical Disney Channel style with uncomplicated story lines, broad humor and moral uplift.\\" In an interview, Bella Thorne said of the show, \\"It is about them going through the stuff that teens go through every day. The writing is very realistic. I have gone through most of these problems.\\" Rosero McCoy, a choreographer for Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam was tapped to be a choreographer for the show, along with Claude Racine. The series follows Hannah Montana, Jonas, I'm in the Band and Phineas and Ferb as Disney's latest foray into music-oriented series. Episode production \\"Start It Up\\" was written by series creator and producer Chris Thompson and directed by Shelley Jensen. Sharon Swab and Rosario J. Roveto, Jr. are credited as assistant directors. All main cast members appear in the episode. Recurring cast members Caroline Sunshine, Anita Barone, and R. Brandon Johnson debut in their roles of Tinka Hessenheffer, Georgia Jones, and Gary Wilde, respectively. Matthew Scott Montgomery guest stars as A.D., as well as Charlie DePewa as Alex Scott. Duncan Tran and Luke Broadlick appear in bit roles as \\"Shake it Up Chicago\\" dancers. As the premiere episode of the series, \\"Start It Up\\" first aired on November 7, 2010, following an hour-long special of Hannah Montana Forever. Four original songs recorded for the series are present in this episode. All of them are present in portions of the \\"Shake it Up Chicago\\" segments of the show. \\"Roll the Dice\\" was written by Niclas Molinder, Joacim Persson, Johan Alkenas, and Geraldo Sandell. Molinder, Persson and Alkenas also receive writing credits on \\"Our Generation,\\" also written by Drew Ryan Scott. \\"Watch Me\\" was written and produced by Ben Charles, Aaron Harmon, and Jim Wes,also \\"All the Way Up\\". Reception The series premiere of Shake It Up was watched by 6.2 million viewers, becoming Disney Channel's second highest-rated premiere in Disney Channel‚Äôs 27-year history, only behind the March 24, 2006 series premiere of Hannah Montana. The premiere scored an 11.0 rating (2.7 million viewers) among the 9- to 14-year-old demographic and a 10.6 rating/share (2.6 million viewers) among the 6- to 11-year-old demographic. It also became the highest- rated Sunday debut for a Disney Channel original series. Overall, it was the seventh most-watched program that aired on US cable television on November 7, 2010.

The designs of bubble canopies can drastically vary; some, such as on later versions of the F4U Corsair, are built into the upper rear fuselage, while others, like the canopy of the P-51D Mustang and most modern combat aircraft, are built flush with the fuselage, providing unobstructed rear visibility. Although experimented with as early as the First World War, the bubble canopy was introduced to widespread use during the Second World War, being used upon a number of American, British, and Japanese aircraft, commonly fighters. During the postwar era, the bubble canopy became a common feature of jet- powered fighter aircraft. Outside of combat aircraft, such canopies have also been adopted upon several helicopters and general aviation aircraft, often for roles that benefit from a high level of exterior visibility, such as aerial reconnaissance. History The bubble canopy has been in use well before Second World War; a number of experimental bubble canopy designs has been trialled during the First World War era. British aircraft designers developed the Malcolm hood, a bulged canopy, that was first adopted on the Supermarine Spitfire and subsequently other aircraft. However, the British Miles M.20 was amongst the first aircraft designs to feature a true one-piece sliding bubble canopy. Although that aircraft never went into production, the concept of the bubble canopy was later used on other British aircraft, such as the Hawker Typhoon and Tempest. Subsequently, Malcolm hood-style canopies were also later fitted to the North American P-51 Mustang. and Republic P-47 Thunderbolt, amongst other aircraft. A well-framed version of an all-around vision canopy was also used on the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service's well-known Mitsubishi A6M Zero Japanese naval fighter, and different designs, with much less framing than the \\"Zero\\" had, were used on the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service's Nakajima Ki-43 Oscar and Nakajima Ki-84 Frank land-based fighter planes. The Bell 47 helicopter was the first production helicopter certified for civilian use in the United States, and in its Model 47D version, pioneered the \\"soap bubble\\"-style canopy for light helicopters ‚Äì as named by its designer, Arthur M. Young ‚Äì that it and the 47G model were to become famous for. Following after the Bell 47, various other rotorcraft have used bubble canopies, including the Robinson R44, Schweizer S333, and the Mil Mi-24, the later versions of the latter possessing a distinctive tandem cockpit with a \\"double bubble\\" canopy that replaced its original angular greenhouse-style cockpit arrangement. Numerous jet-powered fighter aircraft of the postwar era adopted bubble canopies. One of the more prominent external differences between the ground-attack orientated Hawker Siddeley Harrier and the later British Aerospace Sea Harrier, a navalised fighter derivative of the former, was the adoption of an elevated cockpit within a bubble canopy, granting superior exterior visibility to the pilot.Bull 2004, p. 120. The General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon also adopted a frameless bubble canopy in conjunction with a raised and reclined seat that granted unobstructed forward and upward vision. The canopy of the F-16 comprises a single piece of bird- proof polycarbonate; it lacks the forward bow frame found on many fighters, which is an obstruction to a pilot's forward vision.Peacock 1997, p. 99.\\"Lockheed Martin F-16 Fighting Falcon.\\" Jane's All The World's Aircraft, updated 21 January 2008. Retrieved: 30 May 2008. A bubble canopy was also incorporated into the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor, and the Eurofighter Typhoon, both being fighters orientated towards the aerial supremacy role.Stein and Sandl 2012, p. 166. Specialised aerial reconnaissance aircraft have also made use of bubble canopies. The Edgley Optica incorporates an unorthodox fully glazed forward cabin, intended to provide a high level of exterior vision to its crew; the aircraft has a distinctive appearance due to this cabin, often being referred to as the \\"bug-eye\\".Flight International 12 May 1979, p. 1591. The bubble canopy has also been adopted within the general aviation sector; the Diamond DA42 is one such aircraft which incorporates such a canopy in some guises, typically intended for reconnaissance work. Another general aviation aircraft, the Grob G 120, also features a relatively wide bubble-style canopy. Numerous aircraft within the general aviation category feature such canopies. Purpose The purpose of a bubble canopy is to give a pilot a much wider field-of-view than flush, framed \\"greenhouse\\" canopies used on early World War II aircraft, such as those seen on early models of the F4U, P-51, the Soviet Yak-1 and earlier, \\"razorback\\" P-47 fighters, all with dorsal \\"turtledecks\\" integral to their fuselage lines, which left a blind spot behind the pilot that enemy pilots could take advantage of to sneak up on an aircraft. The open-cockpit design combat aircraft of World War I had narrow fuselages, which often were not tall enough to block visibility to the rear, especially with seating positions that generally elevated the pilot's head well above the cockpit's edges. As planes became larger, heavier and faster, designs had to be made stronger, which often meant a taller rear fuselage, but designers tried to maintain the narrow fuselage for visibility. However, as speed continued to increase, it became necessary to enclose cockpits ‚Äì and this, in turn, streamlined aircraft so that they were faster still. Increased \\"g-loading\\" during maneuvers forced pilots to wear tight, restrictive shoulder harnesses, and armor plating began to be installed to protect pilots from projectiles coming from behind. These changes denied a pilot the ability to twist around and look directly behind (known as \\"checking six,\\" or looking at the \\"six o'clock\\" position directly to the rear). Mirrors offered some help, but had a narrow field of view. An early F4U-1 Corsair, with the recessed rear vision panels behind the sliding \\"greenhouse\\"-framed canopy. Prior to bubble canopies, some aircraft, such as the P-40 Warhawk, featured a hybrid flush canopy design, combining a narrow rear fuselage with a glass enclosure conforming to the shape of a full-width fuselage - these often had a pair of recessed panels (one per side, behind the openable canopy) in the dorsal \\"turtledeck\\" structure, faired-in with framed glazing that was flush to the fuselage surface. This provided increased visibility while still allowing a pilot to keep the canopy closed for greater performance. Examples of such \\"recessed\\" rear vision designs were the \\"greenhouse\\"-canopied original F4U-1 Corsair as well as the P-40. The bulged Malcolm hood, used for the Spitfire, F4U Corsair, and P-51B and -C Mustangs was another hybrid. While not offering as much visibility to the rear as the P-40 enjoyed, it allowed a pilot more visibility than a flush canopy would.

It is common in the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and Great Britain, as well as in the Caribbean (where it is usually referred to as curry chicken). A typical curry from the Indian subcontinent consists of chicken stewed in an onion- and tomato-based sauce, flavoured with ginger, garlic, tomato puree, chilli peppers and a variety of spices, often including turmeric, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, and cardamom. Outside South Asia, curry chicken is often made with a pre-made spice mixture known as curry powder.

Indian chicken curry typically starts with whole spices, heated in oil. A sauce is then made with onions, ginger, garlic, and tomatoes, and powdered spices. Bone-in pieces of chicken are then added to the sauce, and simmered until cooked through. In south India, coconut and curry leaves are also common ingredients. Chicken curry is usually garnished with coriander leaves, and served with rice or roti. In south India, chicken curry may be thickened using coconut milk. Trinidad and Tobago This dish was introduced to Trinidad and Tobago by indentured Indian workers. At that time, the dish was very similar to the chicken curry dish of India, consisting mostly of sauce with few chicken pieces. However, poultry in Trinidad and Tobago was so readily available, the dish began consisting of mainly chicken, flavored with curry spices. Curry chicken and its derivatives are also popular in Suriname, Guyana, Jamaica, Barbados, Grenada, and other Caribbean territories with Indian and South Asian influence. Southeast Asia northern Thai curry of palm shoots and chicken. In southeast Asia, where coconuts, coconut milk extraction, and various spices originated, various native dishes made with coconut milk or flavor pastes and eaten with rice are often referred to as \\"curry\\" in English, even though they did not originate from India. Examples of these include Thai gaeng gai and Filipino ginataang manok. However, derivatives of Indian chicken curry may be distinguished because they are relatively modern and are made with curry powder, curry tree leaves, or other Indian spices, like the Filipino chicken curry and the Malaysian chicken curry, although they still use ingredients native to southeast Asia. North America Country captain chicken is a stewed chicken dish flavored with curry powder, popular in parts of the Southern United States. The Hobson- Jobson Dictionary states the following: This dish dates back to the early 1800s. A British sea captain stationed in Bengal, India, shared the recipe for this dish with some friends at the major shipping port in Savannah, Georgia. In 1940, Mrs. W.L. Bullard from Warm Springs, Georgia served this dish under the name Country Captain to Franklin D. Roosevelt (the 32nd president of the United States of America) and to General George S. Patton (a distinguished U.S. Army General). Their warm praise and keen liking and love of this dish were factors in reforging the Southern United States classic status. Roosevelt was so fond of Warm Springs, Georgia, that he built his only self-owned home in Warm Springs. It was a medium-sized, six room cottage, that he liked to call \\"The Little White House\\".

His name is also transliterated as Periyalwar, Periyazhwar, or Periyazhvar The verses of alvars are compiled as Nalayira Divya Prabandham and the 108 temples revered are classified as Divya desam. According to some accounts, Periyalvar is considered the first in the line of the twelve alvars, while other accounts place him as the eighth. His original name is Vishnuchittar, since he blessed Lord Vishnu assuming he is elder to the Lord, he is called Periyalvar. According to Hindu legend, Periyalvar was the foster father of Andal, the only female alvar. The works of Periyalvar contributed to the philosophical and theological ideas of Vaishnavism. His contributions are Thirupallandu and Periya Azhwar thirumozhi among the 4000 stanzas in the Nalayira Divya Prabandam. In South-Indian Vishnu temples, Periyalvar has images and festivals associated with him. The Garudasevai festival in Srivilliputhur temple, where five Vishnu temples in the region participate, is an event dedicated to him. The verses of Periyalvar and other alvars are recited as a part of daily prayers and during festive occasions in most Vishnu temples in South India.  Date  A poem of ‡Æ™‡ØÜ‡Æ∞‡Æø‡ÆØ ‡ÆÜ‡Æ¥‡Øç‡Æµ‡Ææ‡Æ∞‡Øç names the ruling Pandya king as Netumaran, and states that the king extolled the lord of ‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Æ≤‡Æø‡Æ©‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Øç ‡Æö‡Øã‡Æ≤‡Øà (that is, Vishnu). The Pandyan kings were generally staunch Shaivites: the only king described as a parama-vaishnava (\\"Great Vaishnavite\\") in the Pandyan inscriptions was Jatila Parantaka (r. c. 765-815), who was also known as Netun-jataiyan. His successor Shrimara Shrivallabha (r. c. 815-862) was known as Netumaran, although he is not known to be a Vaishnavite. Either of these kings can be identified as the \\"Netumaran\\" mentioned by Periyalvar. Thus, Periyalvar can be placed in the first half of the 9th century. According to the Vaishnavite tradition, Vishnucitta or Periyalvar incarnated on this earth in the 47th year after the beginning of the Kali Era (3102 BC). Alvars Rangamannar-Andal temple in Srivilliputhuralt=Image of Rangamannar-Andal temple in Srivilliputhur showing the pyramidal temple tower The word alvar means the one who is immersed/dives deep into the nectar/ocean of the countless attributes of god. Alvars are considered the twelve supreme devotees of Vishnu, who were instrumental in popularising Vaishnavism. The religious works of these saints in Tamil, songs of love and devotion, are compiled as Nalayira Divya Prabandham containing 4000 verses and the 108 temples revered in their songs are classified as Divya desam.Dalal 2011, pp. 20-21 The saints had different origins and belonged to different castes. As per tradition, the first three azhwars, Poigai, Bhutha and Pey were born miraculously. Tirumizhisai was the son of a sage, Thondaradi, Mathurakavi, Peria and Andal were from brahmin community, Kulasekhara from Kshatria community, Namm was from a cultivator family, Tirupana from panar community and Tirumangai from kazhwar community. Divya Suri Saritra by Garuda- Vahana Pandita (11th century AD), Guruparamparaprabavam by Pinbaragiya Perumal Jiyar, Periya tiru mudi adaivu by Anbillai Kandadiappan, Yatindra Pranava Prabavam by Pillai Lokacharya, commentaries on Divya Prabandam, Guru Parampara (lineage of Gurus) texts, temple records and inscriptions give a detailed account of the alvars and their works. According to these texts, the saints were considered incarnations of some form of Vishnu. Poigai is considered an incarnation of Panchajanya (Krishna's conch), Bhoothath of Kaumodakee (Vishnu's Mace/Club), Pey of Nandaka (Vishnu's sword), Thirumalisai of Sudarshanam (Vishnu's discus), Namm of Vishvaksena (Vishnu's commander), Madhurakavi of Vainatheya (Vishnu's eagle, Garuda), Kulasekhara of Kaustubha (Vishnu's necklace), Periy of Garuda (Vishnu's eagle), Andal of Bhoodevi (Vishnu's wife, Lakshmi, in her form as Bhudevi), Thondaradippodi of Vanamaalai (Vishnu's garland), Thiruppaan of Srivatsa (An auspicious mark on Vishnu's chest) and Thirumangai of Saranga (Rama's bow). The songs of Prabandam are regularly sung in all the Vishnu temples of South India daily and also during festivals. Early life Periyalvar was born into a Brahmin family in Srivilliputhur, near Madurai and was named Vishnuchittar meaning \\"one who has Vishnu in his mind\\". Legend says he rejected the vedic philosophical debates of his upbringing to focus on Bhakti (devotion), especially on doing simple tasks for god. He would make garlands of flowers for the deity of the temple. Once the Pandyan king Vallabhadeva had a competition between scholars to find out the path to paramapada. Vishnuchittar won the competition by explaining that the path to moksha is by service to Vishnu. He quoted various historic and Vedic reference to prove his point. The king was satisfied and he honored Vishnuchittar by taking him around the streets of Madurai. It is believed that Koodal Azhagar, the presiding deity in the Koodal Azhagar Temple near Madurai witnessed the event with his consort. Periyalvar was surprised and he immediately composed Thirupallandu, the first twelve verses of Naliyara Divya Prabandam. Andal Image of Andal decorated with jewels and garland, with her life pictures describing her various stage in life in the background In the Hindu legend, Andal is believed to have been discovered under a Tulsi (Basil) plant in the temple garden of Srivilliputtur, by Vishnuchittar. The childless Vishnuchittar was happy about the child and named her Kodhai. The child was brought up by Vishnuchittar in an atmosphere of love and devotion. Vishnuchittar doted on her in every respect, singing songs to her about Vishnu, teaching her all the stories and philosophy he knew and sharing with her his love for Tamil poetry. As Kodhai grew into a maiden, her love and devotion for Ranganatha (the reclining form of Vishnu) grew to the extent that she decided to marry none but the Ranganatha himself. As days progressed, her resolve strengthened and she started to live in a dream world with her beloved and was constantly fantasizing about marrying him. Vishnuchittar had the responsibility of delivering flower garlands to the Ranganathar temple everyday. Kodhai made these garlands and eventually started wearing the flower garland which was meant to be offered to the deity. However, Kodhai felt she should test to see how the garland suited her and only if it did, she should offer it to the deity. One day, she was caught red- handed by her father in this strange act, and being an orthodox devotee, he was extremely upset. He rebuked her and told her not to repeat the sacrilegious act in the future. Frightened and apologetic, Kodhai made a new garland for the offering that day. Legend says that that very night Vishnu appeared to Vishnuchittar in a dream and asked him why he had discarded Kodhai's garland instead of offering it to him. Vishnuchittar was moved and understood the divine love of his daughter. From that day on, Kodhai is believed to obtained the name \\"Andal\\", the girl who \\"ruled\\" over the Lord. She is also known by a phrase Soodi kodutha Sudarkodi which means \\"The bright creeper-like woman who gave her garlands after wearing them\\". As Andal grew to a marriageable age, Vishnuchittar prepared to get her married to a suitable groom. Andal, however, was stubborn and insisted that she would marry only the god Ranganathar. The father was worried, but Vishnu appeared to Vishnuchittar in a dream and informed him that he would marry Andal at Srirangam. He commanded the priests at Srirangam, in their dreams, to prepare for the wedding. Andal, who was anxious to reach Srirangam, was unable to control herself in her urgency to meet her beloved. She ran into the sanctum sanctorum of Ranganatha and is believed to have merged with him. Works The tower of Andal Temple, is originally believed to have been built by Periyalvar with the prize money he obtained from religious debates in the court of Vallaba Pandya in Madurai. Vishnuchittar composed a couplet called \\"pallandu\\"(‡Æ™‡Æ≤‡Øç‡Æ≤‡Ææ‡Æ£‡Øç‡Æü‡ØÅ) (also called Thirup-Palandu(‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ™‡Æ≤‡Øç‡Æ≤‡Ææ‡Æ£‡Øç‡Æü‡ØÅ) out of respect) translating to \\"Long live for many years, Long live for many years for Hundreds of thousands of years!\\" to God. This is a very important prayer in Srivaishnava liturgy today. Vishnuchittar composed some pasurams in the 4000 Divya Prabhandham called Perialvar Tirumozhi where he explores a devotee's love for God through the metaphor of Yashoda's motherly love for Krishna. He was the adopted father of Kodhai or Andal, the only woman alvar. Periyalvar was fascinated by the childhood exploits of Lord Krishna and developed devotion and love for God, incarnated as Krishna. And he sang of Krishna, the Child Deity, with maternal love. He was more concerned about the welfare of child Krishna than his own. Because of his love and devotion, he was named Perialwar or great alvar. Apart from his native Srivilliputhur, he visited Thirukoshtiyur, Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam, Tiruvellarai and Azhagar Kovil. Culture The devotees of Srivaishnva sect of Hinduism pay respect to the alvars in a similar vein to their worship of Vishnu. The verses of alvars are recited as a part of daily prayers and during festive occasions in most Vishnu temples in South India. There are shrines dedicated to the alvars in most of the Vishnu temples in South India. The Periyalvar Mangalasasanam festival (also called Aani Utsavam) is celebrated every year during the Tamil month of Aadi (July - August) in the Vadapadrasayi temple in Srivilliputhur. The image of Periyalvar receives each of the five Vishnu images for Mangalasasanam. Vadapatrasayee Periya Perumal, festival image of Srivilliputhur Divyadesam, Sundararaja Perumal of Kaatazhagar Temple, Srinivasa Perumal of Tiruvannamalai and Thiru Thangal Appan are received by Periyalvar with different verses from Nalayira Divya Prabandam. In the evening, Garuda Sevai festival is celebrated where all of the festival deities are carried around the streets of Srivilliputhur. Thousands of people from the state participate in the \\"Aadi Pooram\\" festival celebrated in the Andal Temple. After early morning special pujas, the presiding deities, Sri Rengamannar and Goddess Andal are taken in decorated palanquins to the car. The festival marks the adoption of presiding deity, Andal, by Periyalvar after he found her near a Tulsi plant in the garden of Vadabadrasai Temple at Srivilliputhur on the eighth day of the Tamil month of Adi.  Periyazhvar's unconditional love towards Sri Krishna Periyazhvar imagined the temple town of Tirukkoshtiyur in Tamil Nadu to be Gokul, the place where Lord Krishna grew up. The infant Krishna is brought to Gokul and left beside Yasoda. Yasoda wakes up and thinks the child is hers. The news of the baby‚Äôs birth brings the Gopas and Gopikas to Yasoda‚Äôs house, to have a look at the baby. Those who see Him once are not satisfied with just one visit, and they dance with joy. Periyazhvar gave all these descriptions in his Tirukkoshtiyur verses. Periyazhvar celebrated almost every stage of Lord Krishna‚Äôs childhood through verses, imagining himself to be Yasoda, coaxing Krishna to eat, to bathe etc. Periyazhvar admires infant Krishna sticking his big toe in his mouth.Interesting interpretations NotesReferences  Vaishnava saints Alvars ","title":"Periyalvar"},{"id":"9602010","text":"Alfonso Alberto Perla Fuentes (born 28 March 1982 in San Alejo, El Salvador) is a Salvadoran professional football player, who most recently played for Vista Hermosa in the Primera Divisi√≥n de F√∫tbol de El Salvador.

He was elected to play in 3 Pro Bowls. College Pottios played college football at the University of Notre Dame and was drafted in the second round of the 1961 NFL Draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers, also in the third round of the 1961 AFL Draft by the Oakland Raiders. He chose to play in Pittsburgh. NFL=Pittsburgh Steelers Pottios became the starting middle linebacker of the Pittsburgh Steelers from his rookie year, 1961, up to 1965. In his rookie year, he played in all 14 games, intercepting 2 passes and recovering 1 fumble for a defense that was 7th among 14 NFL teams in points allowed. He did not play in 1962. In 1963, he played in all 14 games, intercepting 4 passes for a defense that finished 8th among 14 NFL teams in points allowed, playing alongside rookie outside linebacker Andy Russell. In 1964, he played in only 7 of 14 games, intercepting 1 pass and recovering 1 fumble for a defense that finished 9th among 14 NFL teams in points allowed. In 1965, he played in only 6 games, intercepting no pass and with no fumble recovery for a defense that finished 12th among 14 NFL teams in points allowed and a team that ended the season at 2-12. Los Angeles Rams In contrast, when Pottios joined the Rams from 1966 to 1970, with George Allen as head coach, they were above the .500 mark throughout the period and made the playoffs twice, in 1967 and 1969, with won-lost records of 11-1-2 and 11-3, respectively. Pottios was the starting middle linebacker from 1967 to 1970, playing between outside linebackers Jack Pardee and Maxie Baughan throughout. In 1966, Pottios played in 12 games, but was the backup middle linebacker to the 37-year-old Bill George who played in all 14 games. In 1967, he played 11 of 14 games, intercepting 1 pass and recovering 1 fumble for the best defense in the league among 16 NFL teams in points allowed. That team lost to the Green Bay Packers in the divisional round, in which Pottios started at middle linebacker. In 1968, he played all 14 games, recovering 4 fumbles for a defense that finished 3rd among 16 NFL teams in points allowed. But, in 1969, he played in only 5 of 14 games, replaced by Doug Woodlief. That team lost to the Minnesota Vikings in the divisional round with Woodlief as the starter. In 1970, his final year with the Rams, he regained his starting middle linebacker position, playing in all 14 games, with 2 interceptions and 2 fumbles recovered for a defense that finished 4th among 26 NFL teams in points allowed. Washington Redskins Pottios followed his fired head coach, George Allen, along with Jack Pardee, to the Redskins in 1971, playing up to 1973, where his team reached the playoffs all three years, inserted between outside linebackers Pardee (1971‚Äì72) or Dave Robinson (1973) and Chris Hanburger (1971‚Äì73). In 1971, Pottios played in all 14 games and had one interception for a defense that finished 4th of 26 teams in the NFL in points allowed. That team lost a divisional round game to the San Francisco 49ers in which Pottios started. In 1972, he played in only 7 games of 14 games, replaced by Harold McLinton, and recovered 1 fumble for a defense that finished 3rd of 26 teams in the NFL in points allowed. However, Pottios was the starting middle linebacker in all 3 playoff games the Redskins played that year, when they won a divisional round game against the Green Bay Packers and the NFC championship game against the Dallas Cowboys, in which the Roger Staubach-led Cowboys were limited to a miserable 169 yards of total offense and 3 points. However, Washington lost Super Bowl VII to the Miami Dolphins 14 to 7, din which they could not handle the running attack led by Larry Csonka. In 1973, his final year in the NFL, he played in only 6 of 14 games, but started a divisional round match against the Minnesota Vikings, losing his final game.

While the short book consists of multiple poems covering the everyday mundane, Stein's experimental use of language renders the poems unorthodox and their subjects unfamiliar. Stein began composition of the book in 1912 with multiple short prose poems in an effort to \\"create a word relationship between the word and the things seen\\" using a \\"realist\\" perspective. She then published it in three sections as her second book in 1914. Tender Buttons has provoked divided critical responses since its publication. It is renowned for its Modernist approach to portraying the everyday object and has been lauded as a \\"masterpiece of verbal Cubism\\". Its first poem, \\"A Carafe, That Is a Blind Glass\\", is arguably its most famous, and is often cited as one of the quintessential works of Cubist literature. The book has also been, however, criticized as \\"a modernist triumph, a spectacular failure, a collection of confusing gibberish, and an intentional hoax\\". Style Rather than using conventional syntax, Stein experiments with alternative grammar to emphasize the role of rhythm and sound in an object's \\"moment of consciousness\\". The disconnect between the familiarity of the objects and the manner in which they are described results in the defamiliarization of the familiar while simultaneously familiarizing the unfamiliar. Rather than explore the means in which the signified and the signifier interact, Stein's avant-garde approach to writing deconstructs this relationship and instead obstructs a systematized process of meaning. By both redefining and undermining meaning merely through experimental grammar, Stein is able to displace everyday objects into new contexts, resulting in the reader's redefinition and reassessment of the reality of the mundane. Title Like Stein's syntax of poems in the book, the title juxtaposes two familiar concepts to alienate their familiar meanings. Rather than use an expected collocate, Stein frequently associates two familiar but independent ideas in order to challenge their established authenticity. Many of the titles of the individual poems likewise use similar juxtapositions: \\"Glazed Glitter\\", \\"A Piece of Coffee\\", etc. While the word \\"tender\\" and the word \\"buttons\\" are two ordinary words in the sense that they both have familiar meanings to the average reader, their displacement from a usual context and their subsequent synthesis ruptures a usual understanding of their meanings and implications. By displacing these words into an unfamiliar context, Stein challenges the reader's notion of what these words actually mean. In establishing the phrase, \\"tender buttons\\", as the title of the series, Stein defines her series of poems to be both familiar and foreign in their context. The title of Tender Buttons can likewise be interpreted to suggest a singular, static moment of time that is free of the implications of space. The title, like the poems, exists in a space that is independent of the implications of a certain time, and in this sense, is one reason for the collection's timelessness. Like the other poems in the book, the title can be read in a number of ways. Some have suggested that \\"tender buttons\\" is a reference to women's breasts, in part because of the title's evocation of nipples. Although a more contemporary reaction to the poem stated, \\"The title Tender Buttons, of course, refers to a woman's nipples\\", Stein does not divulge the inspiration behind the title, simply stating, \\"Tender Buttons, will be the title of the book\\". Interpretations =Stein and sexuality Many scholars have likewise identified an underlying theme of lesbianism within Tender Buttons. In addition to the title's French implication of nipples, some have speculated that the poems reveal the intimacies of Stein's relationship with Alice B. Toklas. Phallic and vaginal symbolism are scattered throughout the poems, and Kathryn Kent, among others, has argued that Stein uses familiar objects to invite the reader to \\"tend her buttons\\" and indulge in Stein's \\"sexual/textual manipulations\\". Others have relied on a correlation between Stein's fascination with gazing on the subjects of her poems with Freud's fetishization of the object to reveal this underlying theme of sexuality. Stein and Cubism Stein insisted on the book as being a \\"realistic\\" portrayal of everyday objects. Her first poem in \\"Food\\", \\"Roastbeef\\", describes what some have accepted to be the work's overarching manifesto, as it states, \\"Claiming nothing, not claiming anything, not a claim in everything, collecting claiming, all this makes a harmony, it even makes a succession\\". Rather than attempt to define and give meaning to the object or work of art, Stein instead \\"claims nothing\\" in an attempt to capture the object's \\"realistic\\" nature when stripped of the connotations of its typical representation. Elsewhere, Stein insists on portraying a material world without using the object's preexisting name. She emphasizes the importance of sight, stating, \\"I was trying to live in looking, and looking was not to mix itself up with remembering\\", and \\"I did express what something was, a little by talking and listening to that thing, but a great deal by looking at that thing‚Ä¶ I had the feeling that something should be included and that something was looking, and so concentrating on looking I did the Tender Buttons because it was easier to do objects than people if you were just looking\\". Stein here reveals herself as a Cubist artist in her determination to reconfigure a one- sided perspective while revealing a subject's essence through multiple perspectives. She has additionally cited Picasso's influence on her work, stating, \\"I began to play with words then. I was a little obsessed by words of equal value. Picasso was painting my portrait at that time, and he and I used to talk this thing over endlessly. At the time he had just begun on Cubism\\". Stein likewise experiments with Cubist ideals in composition, stating, \\"Each part is as important as the whole\\". Tender Buttons: The Corrected Centennial Edition (City Lights Publishers) was released in April, 2014 to coincide with the 100th anniversary of its publication.https://jacket2.org/reviews/twenty- two-tender-buttonshttp://www.citylights.com/book/?GCOI=87286100683310 References External links  *Tender Buttons (full text) * Poetry by Gertrude Stein 1914 books ","title":"Tender Buttons (book)"},{"id":"9602110","text":"Class 423 train at Wolfratshausen station Line S7 is a line on the Munich S-Bahn network.

The movie tells the story of a woman unhappy in her passionless marriage leaving her husband for a younger and more ardent lover. Production Kenneth More was the only key member of the original cast (who had also appeared in a BBC Television version in 1954) to be hired for the film, as Alexander Korda wanted to use names that were more recognisable to movie goers.

He graduated from the University of St Andrews in 1621, studied theology and later served as a tutor for the family of the earl of Mar. He became minister of Guthrie in 1624, and was promoted by King Charles I to the Church of the Holy Rude, Stirling in 1632. He took an ambiguous role in the Covenanter Wars and the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. He was deposed from his Stirling charge in 1648, although in 1656 was readmitted to the ministry, being given Kilspindie. Despite once opposing the re- establishment of episcopacy, abandoned since the National Covenant of 1638, he changed his position, and later after the episcopate of George Haliburton, became Bishop of Dunkeld, to which position he was consecrated on 24 August 1665. He held this position until his death in 1676. Guthrie is best remembered for the account of his times he wrote and left to posterity, his Observations.

Once a trade is completed, a record is created on the site for future reference. GameTZ.com has forums and a trading/matching system that contains many tools necessary for tracking and recording online trading transactions. GameTZ.com's offer system provides users with the ability to send and receive offers, check out trade details, shipping methods, and so on. Multi-platform gaming magazine GamePro and Forbes magazine have cited trading sites, specifically GameTZ.com, to be excellent alternatives to selling games back to retail outlets at significantly reduced value. GameTZ.com has also been featured in other magazine articles and online reviews, as well as in a short TV news segment syndicated to stations across the United States. History The Used Game Trading Zone (UGTZ) was founded by Stephen Osborne in the mid-1990s. Exactly when UGTZ came into existence is uncertain, but it has been traced back as far as December 23, 1996 (via a USENET posting by Osborne). Osborne manually maintained a growing list of items that traders had available for trade. Traders would then scan through the very large lists to find items they wanted, then make offers via email to the owner(s) of the items. As UGTZ continued to grow, this list became perpetually more difficult for Osborne to maintain by hand. In October 1997, Bill Marrs created a system which automated much of the work Osborne had been doing by hand. For a short time thereafter, parts of UGTZ were maintained on both Osborne's and Marrs' sites. Eventually, the decision was made to move the whole operation to Marrs' site. The domain name ugtz.com was registered in the summer of 1998, followed by the implementation of an independent database in the spring of 1999 . This database allowed traders to view a list of potential trades, saving them a great deal of time in finding trades. In an effort to generate some income, 1999 also introduced advertisements, subscriptions, and an affiliate marketing program to the site. In March 2000, the site was renamed Game Trading Zone and the domain name gametz.com was registered. Marrs cloned the GameTZ.com trading engine and established three other sites: MusicTZ.com, MovieTZ.com, and BookTZ.com. However, at the beginning of 2002, the music, movie, and book domains were dropped and all four \\"Trading Zones\\" were folded back into the main GameTZ.com site. In February 2003, the site changed to a subscriber-only format where passive use of the site by non-subscribers was still possible, but a subscription was necessary to initiate trades and be actively involved in the community. In August 2005, the site reverted to voluntary subscriptions and non-subscribers were again allowed full access to GameTZ.com's trading and community features. GameTZ.com has more than 300,000 trades completed as of October 2015, and has over 4800 registered traders. In the Holiday 2007 issue of EGM, the site was rated #2 of the top five sites for trading games online, only losing out to Goozex due to its less-flashy, message board-like interface.

Civil union proposals On 15 June 2007, the lower house of the Congress of Colombia approved a historic same-sex union bill by a vote of 62-43, and President √Ålvaro Uribe was expected to sign the measure, which had been approved by the Colombian Senate in April. However, on 19 June, a group of conservative senators broke party discipline in what is usually a routine vote on the final form of a bill and defeated the measure by 34-29 in the 102-member Senate. About 80 LGBT rights advocates held a demonstration outside Congress the following day, protesting the bill's defeat. Supporters vowed to revive the legislation. The bill, which had been endorsed by conservative President √Ålvaro Uribe, would have made Colombia the first nation in Latin America to grant same-sex couples in long-term relationships the same rights to health insurance, inheritance and social security as heterosexual couples. On 17 March 2015, Senator Armando Benedetti introduced a civil union bill.

In October 2012, Senator Armando Benedetti introduced a bill legalizing same-sex marriage. The bill initially only allowed for civil unions, but the text was changed by Benedetti. President Juan Manuel Santos did not take a position on the bill. The Senate's First Committee approved the bill on 4 December 2012. On 24 April 2013, it was rejected by the Senate in a 17-51 vote, after being postponed on two different occasions. The negative outcome was expected, as the two biggest parties made a commitment to kill the bill. Senator Benedetti responded to the vote calling the Colombian Congress \\"worthless\\", and stating that senators who voted against the project wanted the Congress to be like the ones of \\"Congo, Uganda, Bolivia and Haiti\\". Days before the vote, Superintendent Jorge Enrique V√©lez announced that if the Congress failed to pass the same-sex marriage bill before the 20 June deadline, the Minister of Justice would prepare guidelines for notaries and judges to conduct \\"solemn contracts\\" for same-sex couples.

In September 2013, two civil court judges married two same-sex couples. The first marriage was challenged by a conservative group, and it was initially annulled. However, in October, the Bogot√° High Court () maintained the validity of that marriage. The issue of same-sex marriage once again went before the Constitutional Court after the country's Inspector General requested that the court invalidate all the marriages. A hearing was scheduled for 7 May 2015. It was postponed as some judges were not present and a new hearing open to the public happened on 30 July 2015. A verdict was to be reached before 31 August 2015. On 30 July 2015, Senator Benedetti introduced a same-sex marriage bill.

He made the statement the day after a multi-country same-sex couple began an unprecedented legal battle to have their 2013 marriage (registered in Spain) recognised in Colombia. Colombian government agencies began recognising same-sex marriages lawfully performed in foreign jurisdictions in March 2016. Same-sex couples married abroad are now entitled to the same visa, healthcare benefits, inheritance and pension rights as heterosexual spouses once they take a stamped marriage certificate and identification papers to the nearest designated office. Constitutional Court ruling The Colombian Constitutional Court () issued a ruling on 28 April 2016 legalizing same-sex marriage in Colombia. In March 2016, a draft of a ruling, considered to be a minority opinion of the Constitutional Court, was published by Judge Jorge Ignacio Pretelt. The draft argued that marriage applied only to one man and one woman and that it was up to Congress to legalize same-sex marriage. On 7 April 2016, the Court voted 6-3 against the proposal. Judge Alberto Rojas R√≠o was assigned to prepare a new proposal, which was expected to be in line with the court majority's view (i.e. to declare that prohibiting same-sex couples from getting married is unconstitutional). The court announced its decision on 28 April 2016, ruling by a 6-3 margin that \\"marriage between people of the same sex does not violate the constitutional order.\\" The ruling established that every \\"solemn contract\\" entered into by same-sex couples since 20 June 2013 (under the provisions of the court's previous ruling in the C-577/2011 case) is legally valid and to be recognised as a marriage, meaning that couples who have entered into such unions since 20 June 2013 need not remarry as a result of the court's April 2016 ruling. The ruling was officially published on 7 July 2016. Sentencia SU214/16 Presiding Judge Maria Victoria Calle told the court; \\"all people are free to choose independently to start a family in keeping with their sexual orientation... receiving equal treatment under the constitution and the law.\\" The court's ruling informed state judges, notaries and clerks that they \\"must ensure that citizens' fundamental rights are observed and that they are all granted equal treatment.\\" The first same- sex wedding in the country following the ruling happened in Cali on 24 May 2016. On 12 July 2016, the Constitutional Court rejected a challenge to the ruling filed by a conservative group opposed to same-sex marriage. In January 2017, the Constitutional Court rejected an appeal filed by former Attorney General Alejandro Ord√≥√±ez to nullify the ruling.Colombian High Court Rejects Appeal To Null Same-Sex Marriage Statistics In Colombia, civil marriages are performed by notaries and judges. Every marriage performed in Colombia has to be registered with the Registradur√≠a Nacional de Colombia. According to the Superintendencia de Notariado y Registro, notaries performed 138 same-sex marriages in 2016, 341 in 2017 and 316 in 2018, with Antioquia, Cundinamarca (including Bogot√°), Valle del Cauca and Risaralda departments recording the most marriages. By June 2019, 968 same-sex marriages had been performed by notaries in Colombia since legalization; 258 in Bogot√°, 240 in Medell√≠n, 92 in Cali, and 79 in Pereira. Six same-sex divorces occurred in 2017 and five in 2018. In December 2019, Bogot√° Mayor Claudia L√≥pez Hern√°ndez married her partner Ang√©lica Lozano Correa, in one of the more notable same-sex marriages in Colombia. Public opinion A poll conducted between December 2009 and January 2010 in Colombia's capital, Bogot√°, showed that 63% of the city's population was in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage, while 36% was against it. The poll showed that women and people with a higher education level were more likely to support same-sex marriage. A nationwide poll taken in November 2012 found that 28% of Colombians supported same-sex marriage, while 66% opposed it and 6% did not respond. According to a Pew Research Center survey, conducted between 28 November 2013 and 4 March 2014, 28% of Colombians supported same-sex marriage, 64% were opposed. A Gallup national poll conducted in July 2016 showed that 40% of Colombians supported same-sex marriage, while 57% were opposed. The 2017 AmericasBarometer showed that 34% of Colombians supported same-sex marriage. A 2018 Gallup poll found that support for same-sex marriage had increased to 46%, with 52% of Colombians opposed. In October 2019, an Invamer poll showed that support for same-sex marriage had, for the first time ever in Colombia, reached 50%, with 47% opposing. As for same-sex adoption, acceptance was at 36% and opposition at 62%.

The Hitchcock Ichnological Cabinet is a collection of fossil footmarks assembled between 1836 and 1865 by Edward Hitchcock (1793‚Äì1864), noted American geologist, state geologist of Massachusetts, United States, and President of Amherst College. He was one of the first experts in fossil tracks. A footmark impression in stone is a petrosomatoglyph. Begun when the science of ichnology (the study of tracks) was in its infancy, and the word dinosaur had not been coined yet, the collection was made chiefly from the fossils of the Connecticut River Valley (Connecticut River Valley trackways). By 1875 this collection consisted of 21,773 tracks representing 120 species. It is the world's largest collection of dinosaur tracks. Starting in 1855, the collection was located in the lower level of Appleton Cabinet on the Amherst College campus. It has subsequently been twice relocated, and can now be found in the Amherst College Museum of Natural History.

It was classified as a subspecies of the eastern marsh harrier (Circus spilonotus) of eastern Asia. It is thinly scattered across the whole of New Guinea except for the Vogelkop peninsula in the west. There are several unconfirmed reports from Australia but the bird can easily be confused with the swamp harrier. It inhabits grassland and wetlands up to 3800 m above sea-level. It hunts low over open ground searching for small mammals, birds and lizards. The adult male is usually silvery-grey with black head, throat, back and wing-markings and white underparts. Adult females are brown with a pale rump, barred tail and streaked underparts. Juveniles are blackish-brown with cream-coloured markings on the head, more extensive in the female. The length of the bird varies from 47 to 54 cm; females are larger than the males. In the central highlands and the Sepik valley there is a dark morph; males of this form are mostly blackish with a grey tail and the females are mostly dark brown. References * Brian J.

It was later renamed New Leader and Socialist Leader, before finally taking the name Labour Leader again. 19th century The origins of the paper lay in The Miner, a monthly paper founded by Keir Hardie in 1887. Its main purpose was to advocate for a federation of Scottish miners.\\"Hardie, (James) Keir\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography The first issue contained an influential programme for labour, co-authored by Hardie and Chisholm Robertson,David Howell, British Workers and the Independent Labour Party, 1888-1906, p.146 marking Hardie's switch from support for the Liberal Party to advocating independent labour candidacies. The paper was used as Hardie's platform in the 1888 Mid Lanarkshire by-election, following which Hardie became a founder member of the Scottish Labour Party and relaunched The Miner as the Labour Leader. In 1893 the Scottish Labour Party affiliated to the Independent Labour Party (ILP). Hardie became the party's first leader and began using the Labour Leader as a forum for the development of policy for the new party. In 1894 he was able to increase the paper's frequency from monthly to weekly. 20th century Hardie continued to publish and edit the Labour Leader until 1904, when he sold it to the ILP, amid some controversy on the appropriate recompense due to him. The ILP appointed John Bruce Glasier to replace Hardie as editor in January 1905. Glasier was able to take sales from 13,000 at the start of his editorship to 43,000 in 1908, but attracted criticism from some ILP members for consistently endorsing all the actions of the party's leadership. He stood down from the post in April 1909.\\"Glasier, John Bruce\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography In 1909 party members were encouraged to write for the Labour Leader rather than rival publications. For example, Frederick William Jowett's parliamentary column was transferred from The Clarion.\\"Jowett, Frederick William\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Throughout this period the paper was known for investigative reporting and high-quality journalism. As early as 1899 an investigation by Hardie had sensationally exposed poor conditions at the Overtoun Chemical Works,White, John Campbell, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography while in 1913 and 14, Walton Newbold worked on a lengthy article exposing the interests of the defence industry.\\"Newbold, (John Turner) Walton\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography First World War In 1912 the editorship passed to Fenner Brockway, who imposed a policy of strident pacifism, opposing the First World War with front-page headlines such as \\"The War Must Be Stopped\\" and \\"Down With The War\\".Fenner Brockway , Learn Peace (Peace Pledge Union) In 1915 the paper's offices were raided by the police and Brockway was charged with publishing seditious material. Brockway won the case, but commented, \\"if we weren't dangerous to the government we were failing in our duty!\\" However, his work in the No-Conscription Fellowship led to his repeated imprisonment and by 1916 he felt unable to continue as editor.Brockway, (Archibald) Fenner, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Katherine Glasier took over the editorship.\\"Glasier, Katharine St John Bruce\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography In 1917 the government prohibited the export of the Labour Leader from the UK.Cases of general interest, The National Archives By 1918 Glasier had increased circulation to 62,000, but she became increasingly at odds with the prominent columnist Philip Snowden. His opposition to the October Revolution was vocally resisted by Glasier, and in the ensuing dispute sales fell away. The stress of the dispute may have contributed to her nervous breakdown. Inter-war years After Glasier resigned from the paper Clifford Allen, then the Treasurer of the ILP, decided that a new approach was necessary. The paper was renamed the New Leader and H. N. Brailsford was appointed editor.\\"Allen, (Reginald) Clifford\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Alarmed at Brailsford's left wing reputation, Ramsay MacDonald ensured that Mary Hamilton was appointed as his more moderate deputy, although she soon left the post.\\"Hamilton, Mary Agnes\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Brailsford championed articles on cultural topics alongside an increased proportion of theoretical pieces, and contributed numerous articles proposing a programme for a living wage.

In 1929 Brockway was elected as the Member of Parliament for Leyton East and stood down from the paper. He was replaced by John Paton. Paton was also an advocate of the living wage policy, but gave only reluctant support to the idea that the ILP should split from the Labour Party.\\"Paton, John\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Out of Parliament again in 1931, Brockway returned to the editor's chair, remaining in the post until 1946, when he resigned from the ILP and rejoined the Labour Party.Janus: The Papers of Fenner Brockway On 11 March 1938, the magazine published an editorial (titled Stalin-Stop!) calling on Joseph Stalin to end the Moscow Trials.Paul Corthorn, In the Shadow of the Dictators : the British Left in the 1930s.

It inhabits Madagascar and the Comoro Islands in the Indian Ocean. It was formerly regarded as a subspecies of the R√©union harrier (C. maillardi) but is increasingly treated as a separate species. It is also known as the Madagascar harrier, Madagascar marsh harrier or Malagasy marsh harrier. Description It is about 42‚Äì55 cm long; the female is up to 13% larger than the male. The male has a blackish back and a greyer head with dark streaks. The underparts and rump are whitish and the tail is grey with dark bars. The forewings and wingtips are blackish while the secondaries are grey with dark bars. Females are browner than the males. The R√©union harrier is smaller and darker with shorter legs and shorter, more rounded wings. Males have a blacker head and plainer secondaries and tail. Distribution and habitat In Madagascar it is found in marshland and grassland across the island except for the south. It is generally scarce with the largest numbers in the north-west. It occurs from sea-level up to 1800 m. On the Comoros it is more often found in drier habitats and in forested areas. It has occurred on all four main islands but there are no recent records from Mayotte. Its population size is uncertain but is estimated to be between 250 and 999 individuals. It is thought to be declining as a result of hunting and habitat destruction and is classed as endangered by BirdLife International. Behaviour It feeds mainly on birds such as the Madagascan partridge and also takes reptiles, amphibians, rodents and insects. It typically feeds by flying low over the ground and dropping down rapidly when it spots its prey. It will also hunt over the canopy of forests. It breeds in marshland, building a nest of grass and stems on the ground or low in a bush. The white eggs are incubated for about 32‚Äì34 days and the young birds fledge after 42‚Äì45 days.

The birds are mostly silent except during the breeding season when they give a chattering threat call, a wailing courtship call and chuckling food-associated calls. The Malagasy harrier is larger and paler with longer wings and legs. Ecology It is typically found in forested upland areas between 300 and 700 m above sea-level. It also visits cane fields and grassland. Today its diet includes many introduced mammals (rats, mice and tenrecs) but it originally fed mainly on birds and insects. It will also take small lizards, frogs and carrion. It has a number of adaptations which are unusual among harriers: broad rounded wings for hunting between trees and a short tarsus and long claws, which are common among those birds of prey which feed on other birds.Clarke, Roger (1995) The Marsh Harrier, Hamlyn, London. It breeds between January and May and lays two or three white eggs in a nest on the ground.Barr√©, Nicolas; Armand Barau & Christian Jouanin (1996) Oiseaux de la R√©union, Les √âditions du Pacifique, Paris. Status and conservation In 2011 it had an estimated population of at least 564 birds including about 150 breeding pairs. It has been evaluated as endangered by BirdLife International and it is threatened by destruction and disturbance of its habitat and by poaching, deliberate persecution and accidental poisoning by rodenticides. It became a protected species in 1966 and its numbers were thought to be stable or increasing until 2000‚Äì2010 when its population appeared to decrease. Sites identified by BirdLife International as being important for the conservation of the species are the Important Bird Areas (IBAs) of: * Mouth of the Cirque de Salazie * Ravine de la Grande Chaloupe * Rivi√®re des Marsouins ‚Äì Grand √âtang * Rivi√®re des Remparts - Rivi√®re Langevin Taxonomy Sub-fossil remains of a R√©union harrier 9‚Äì10 and other birds from Mauritius The species was described in 1862 by Jules Verreaux. He named it in honour of Louis Maillard, a French botanist and engineer who mentioned the bird in a book about the island. In 1893 Alfred Newton and Hans Gadow described tarsometatarsi, tibiae and metacarpals from a hawk called Astur alphonsi (later renamed Accipiter alphonsi and Circus alphonsi) from Mauritius.Rothschild, Walter (1907) Extinct Birds, Hutchinson & Co., London. In 1958 James Greenway considered this taxon as conspecific with the pied harrier.Greenway, James (1958; 1967 for the 2nd edition) Extinct and Vanishing Birds of the World, Dover Publications. A later examination of the bones came to the conclusion that Astur alphonsi is actually identical with Circus maillardi, which formerly occurred on Mauritius too but is now extirpated.Mourer-Chauvir√©, C√©cile; Roger Bour & Sonia Ribes (2004) \\"The taxonomic identity of Circus alphonsi (Newton & Gadow 1893), the extinct harrier from Mauritius\\", Ibis, 146 (1): 168-172.

Early life Matrona was born to Dmitry and Natalia Nikonov in the village of Sebino in Tula Province.Blessed Matrona, Pravmir Portal, May 2009, in Russian She was the fourth child in the family. Her struggling parents planned to place her in an orphanage after her birth but her mother changed her mind after she had a dream, in which she saw that a white bird of divine beauty, with empty eye sockets, landed on her breast. When Matrona was born, she was blind, with eyelids closed over empty eye sockets. Her mother took this as a heavenly sign. According to legend, by the time she was eight, she had revealed prophetic and healing powers. Revolution Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, she and her friend Lydia Yankova became homeless peasants who left their villages to find work and food in larger cities. By 1925, Matrona moved to Moscow, possibly following her two brothers, and took to a life of wandering, finding shelter with friends and relatives in houses, apartments, and basements. She could not stay with her two brothers, both Communists, because Matrona preached the Russian Orthodox faith. Later life At a time when other religious people were sent to the Gulag or sent into exile for their beliefs, no one ever betrayed Matrona's location. People continued to come to Matrona for advice and for help with their troubles. A story, related by her biographer, Zinaida Zhdanova, tells how Matrona told Zinaida's mother, Evdokia, described as a plain 28-year-old, that she would marry a handsome nobleman. Evdokia moved to Moscow and became a cook at the house of a rich nobleman whose son, Vladimir, was betrothed to one Shukhova. Shortly thereafter, Vladimir is said to have had a dream in which a voice told him to marry a woman named Evdokia. The next morning he asked if there was such a woman in the household, met her, and nearly fainted. Later, he was sent for training to Perm with Evdokia, and Zinaida was born shortly thereafter. In another of her reported miracles, she helped a college architecture student revise a paper required for graduation by describing in detail some of the great architectural achievements in Florence and Rome, including the Palazzo Pitti. She is said to have predicted her own death three days in advance, accepting all visitors during those final days. Following her death in 1952, her gravesite became a pilgrimage site. She was recently canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church. Her remains are now in the Church of the Protecting Veil of Our Lady at Intercession Convent in Moscow.Sedmitza Portal The lines of people waiting to visit her gravesite is reported as regularly being quite long (often needing three or four hours to make a short visit to the gravesite) and well-behaved.

The music for the song was written by Henry Krieger, composer of the original Broadway play, with lyrics by Siedah Garrett. It is one of the four songs featured in the film that are not present in the original Broadway play. It was nominated for the 2007 Academy Award for Best Original Song, and won the 2008 Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media. Song information \\"Love You I Do\\" is a rhythm and blues and soul song inspired by the early 1960s work of female singers such as Aretha Franklin and Mary Wells. In the context of the film, the song is performed in a scene set in 1963 by soul singer Effie White (Hudson), and expresses Effie's romantic feelings for her boyfriend and record label head, Curtis Taylor Jr. (Jamie Foxx). As do most songs in the movie version of \\"Dreamgirls,\\" this song serves two purposes. Effie is performing the piece to Curtis for review, hoping it will win her a song of her own on a record instead of remaining a mere backup singer for Jimmy Early. The song also helps further illustrate Effie's feelings for Curtis, though he is clearly more interested in Deena Jones. It is highly likely that he is merely feigning love for Effie to control and manipulate her. Produced by The Underdogs, \\"Love You I Do\\" was one of three Dreamgirls songs nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 79th Academy Awards; the others were \\"Patience\\" and \\"Listen\\". At the Academy Awards ceremony, Hudson performed \\"Love You I Do\\" as a duet with her co-star, Beyonc√© Knowles. All three songs lost to \\"I Need to Wake Up\\" by Melissa Etheridge from the film An Inconvenient Truth. American Idol finalist Jessica Sanchez covered this song on the show.

It is about a woman in love with a younger teenage boy. In French the film is called J'aime ce gar√ßon. Plot Phoebe (Nadia Litz) is a perky university student who has difficulty relating to her fellow students. Her only friend is her roommate Robin (Nikki Barnett) who she smothers with advice. Eventually Robin cracks under the pressure of being Phoebe's only friend and leaves on a plane with a stranger she just met, informing Phoebe that she is too uptight and immature, casually mentioning that she's never even had a boyfriend. Embarrassed by her own immaturity Phoebe tries to go on a date. After it goes sour she ends up talking to Frazer, her 14-year-old neighbour who mows her lawn. As time passes, Phoebe grows close to Frazer as he enjoys listening to her advice and looks up to and respects her while at the same time teaching her to have fun and relax. However their friendship begins to strain when Robin returns and notices that Phoebe is spending lots of time with Frazer and has crossed getting a boyfriend off her task list. Meanwhile, Suzanna (Ellen Page), Frazer's neighbour, grows jealous of all the time he spends with Phoebe and tells him that Phoebe will want to have sex with him in an effort to scare him. Instead Frazer buys condoms and later attempts to kiss Phoebe. Disturbed, Phoebe brushes him off and pushes him away. On her way to graduation Frazer approaches Phoebe to talk. She ends up kissing him in front of Robin and her friends but the two realize the age difference between them is too large for anything romantic to happen. Instead, they go to Phoebe's graduation ceremony as friends. Production Love That Boy was filmed in Halifax, Nova Scotia.\\"Love That Boy features best talent Canada- and Cape Breton- have to offer,\\" Cape Breton Post, Cape Breton, N.S.: Jan 14, 2004. pg. B.9. One critic speculated the budget was low, but that that was used as an advantage, saying a \\"slightly cheesy look and sound of everything in Phoebe's life... justifies good old Canuck cheapness as a point of comedy.\\"Liz Nicholls, \\"Stylized, surreal charms of Love That Boy don't go all the way,\\" Edmonton Journal, January 23, 2004, pg. E.10. Director Andrea Dorfman told the press that in her work, she tried to adapt reality with character-based style, and would \\"look at things from a different perspective.\\" Dorfman co-wrote the screenplay, placing the character Phoebe in university because Dorfman saw herself as overconfident of her knowledge when she went to college. The point would then be to demonstrate that studying is not complete knowledge.Katherine Monk, \\"Vintage duds and counterculture cool,\\" The Ottawa Citizen, January 9, 2004, pg. H.3. Dorfman also claims that the low budget was because larger companies would want to change the story so that Frazer and Phoebe become lovers, while the actual points of the film were reaching maturity and friendship.Skana Gee, \\"Love That filmmaker: Dorfman scores again with Love That Boy,\\" Daily News, Halifax, Nova Scotia: September 18, 2003, pg. H.14. Casting Dorfman had previously made a film entitled Parsley Days. That film had impressed Litz, and Litz felt that anything else by Dorfman would be good. Thus, when Litz was informed by her agent that she could audition by videotape for a film by Dorfman, Litz opted instead to fly from Los Angeles, California to audition in person.Jason Anderson, \\"MEET... Nadia Litz,\\" Eye Weekly, November 13, 2003, URL accessed 19 February 2007. Dorfman also found Dixon to be \\"an old soul.\\" Release The film was first run at the Atlantic Film Festival on September 19, 2003. The film was re-released on November 7 of that year.Rita Zekas, \\"Warning Powdered coffee creamer is nothing to sniff at,\\" Toronto Star, October 24, 2003, pg. D.06. On January 24, 2004, it played in Oxford Cinema in Halifax, which the press claimed marked the first time the film would be screened where it had been shot.\\"Love That Boy playing at Oxford,\\" Daily News, Halifax, Nova Scotia: January 22, 2004, pg. 14. Reception Despite the similarity in the subject matter, one critic asserted that Love That Boy is not a \\"male version of Lolita,\\" but rather just a statement of how love can be perplexing. This critic complimented Litz and Dixon's acting, and called Love That Boy \\"a little gem of a film.\\" Katherine Monk of The Ottawa Citizen also addressed the subject matter, saying that the film is \\"a little bizarre- not to mention disconcerting... the film rides the edge of ickiness.\\" However, Monk credited Dorfman and Litz with \\"charm\\" and \\"style\\" that eased these factors.Katherine Monk, \\"Riding the edge of ickiness,\\" The Ottawa Citizen, January 16, 2004, pg. D.3. Litz herself acknowledged that sex between the main characters \\"would be gross.\\" Monk also said that Litz \\"makes us believe in the near-cartoonish Phoebe by giving her moments of vulnerability and compassion.\\" For this film, the Vancouver Film Critics Circle nominated Litz as Best Actress of the year in Canadian cinema, but she lost to Sarah Polley in My Life Without Me.David Spaner, \\"Lost in Translation wins big,\\" The Province, Vancouver, B.C.: February 5, 2004. pg. B.5. However, another critic wrote that \\"The whole thing is charming to look at, wise and funny- but, alas, slim. Slight.\\" Columnist David Spaner disapproved of Dixon's acting, although he felt Litz and Barnett were good, and found the writing poor in places. He doubted the film's wisdom because he felt lines like \\"I am too much and not enough at the same time\\" had been done before and were incomprehensible.David Spaner, \\"Love That Boy relentlessly cute,\\" The Province, Vancouver, B.C.: November 14, 2003, pg.

Within the context of the film, the social protest song is spearheaded by star performer James \\"Thunder\\" Early (played by Eddie Murphy) only for its release to get killed by the hustling record business figure Curtis Taylor, Jr. (played by Jamie Foxx).

Background and critical responses  \\"Patience\\" didn't exist during the creation of the original Dreamgirls musical, a stage drama which made its debut on Broadway in December 1981. Songwriters Henry Krieger and Willie Reale devised \\"Patience\\" for the musical's 2006 movie adaption, which also featured the title Dreamgirls. The r&b; track has been incorporated to more recent revivals of the stage drama, with \\"Patience\\" being one of several elements crossing from the adaption to its parent production. The socially-charged lyrics and impassioned singing behind the song make it an inspirational piece of protest music meant to evoke the 70s-era musical work of artists such as Donny Hathaway, Marvin Gaye, and Stevie Wonder. \\"Patience\\" is performed both in the film and on its related soundtrack by the trio of Eddie Murphy, Anika Noni Rose, and Keith Robinson. It was Record producer by The Underdogs. In the context of the film, \\"Patience\\" is a politically-charged piece written by talented singer- songwriter C.C. White (played by Robinson) and recorded by star performer James \\"Thunder\\" Early (played by Murphy) coupled with vocalist Lorrell Robinson (played by Rose) and a gospel choir. In a scene set in 1973, the song comes into being after Early seeks to develop his public image while being under the thumb of manipulative, shady record business figure Curtis Taylor, Jr. (played by Jamie Foxx). Much to the chagrin of his employees, Foxx's character axes the song's release. This feeds into the flashes of anxiety and depression suffered by Murphy's character, which he self-medicates through illicit drug use. \\"Patience\\" was one of three Dreamgirls songs nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 79th Academy Awards. The others were \\"Love You I Do\\" and \\"Listen\\". All three Dreamgirls songs (as well as the piece \\"Our Town\\" that Randy Newman penned for Cars) lost the Oscar to \\"I Need to Wake Up\\" by Melissa Etheridge, which the songwriter created for An Inconvenient Truth. At the 2007 Academy Awards ceremony, \\"Patience\\" was performed by Rose and Robinson along with a gospel choir and their co-stars Beyonc√© Knowles and Jennifer Hudson.

In this process, groups form, break up, and recombine as part of an emerging process, with all participants aware of and helping to advance the structure of the whole. This is different from fixed, small group collaboration, in which groups are often fixed for the duration of the inquiry, with a pre-specified culminating task, and a fixed stage-model of inquiry with a time-line for each stage, making clear who will do what, in what format and by when. Opportunistic collaboration is emerging in knowledge organizations. As Chatzkel (2003) asserted, a knowledge organization ‚Äúneeds to nurture its people so that they feel free to move about in their organization, to group and regroup in different configurations as needed, and to rework themselves and their resources in concert with their new conditions.‚Äù (p. 20) It is a promising direction to explore this design in educational contexts.

The Uniza descendants are of the Aldabra clan and centered in Authal in Saudi Arabia. The Shammar progeny named Aladhadh is of the Alaslam tribe of the Shammar. People with this last name are on both sides of the Iraqi-Saudi border. The contributions of the House of Aladhadh to Iraq's history makes them the focus of this article as opposed to their kin who live sixty miles southeast of Ha'il. They descend from Sheikh Mohamad ibn Shk Hamad bin Husain bin Abdullah Alrashed who left to Iraq via Jordan from Najd.  History  The Aladhadh clan of Shammar is still based southeast of Ha'il in modern-day Saudi Arabia. The House of Aladhadh is first reported to have settled in alhassaniya on the border of kerbala after a war with alsarhan clan over the Shka Hamda's refusal to marry her maternal cousin from Alsarhan tribe. It is believed that Shk Mohammed Bin hamad had a dispute with his brother Farahan over the line of succession for leadership of Almasoud tribe which separate from Alaslam trive of Shammar in 1707. This would be consistent with Shk Mohammad's settling in Najaf. Upon arrival to Najaf city in Iraq, he married with the prominent Arab houses such as Alshamsa and Alhabubi. The \\"Aladhadh\\" name was etched into Iraq's map when Shk Mihammed built a famous agricultural project and an artificial river named after them Aladhadh River \\"ŸÜŸáÿ± ÿßŸÑÿπÿ∂ÿßÿ∂ÿ©\\". The House of Aladhadh was one of the main builders of the city of Nasiryah. Their ownership in one of the first registered houses in Nasirya places them there before the establishment of the municipal office in 1878. This is supported by their reported alliance with Alsaadon whose emirate in Nasirya lasted 1530-1918.The Whose Who of Iraqi Politics by Meer Basri (Arabic)Haj Ali bin Shk Mohamad Aladahdh was the city's first elected mayor. Shk Mohamad Aladhadh is the son of Shk Hamad Bin Hussein Bin Abdullah Alrashed. Abudllah Alrashed is the son of Frair bin Marmous Bin Masoud from the alaslam branch of Shammar. There is evidence that some Aladhadh clansmen had moved from Nejd to Alkhmasiya which is located 17 kilometers southwest of Soug Alshiokh, Alkhmasiya was first established in 1881.

He is reported to have ailed for over two years at their main house in the city. He was washed and buried in that house. For a national hero, the Aladahdh clan built a shrine to commemorate as valiant efforts for his country. People from all over Iraq came to visit and pay their respects.Alhabubi a National Hero online(Arabic) In 1920, several members of the Aladhadh family participated in the 1920 revolution against British occupation. In 1948 Mohamad Aladhadh was a soccer player in one of the city's two teams. In 1958, the Aladhadh family represented the province of Dhi Qar in the Iraqi National Congress the highest legislative body in Iraq under the Hashemite royal Family. In 1969 the poet Adel Hadi Aladhadh was founder of the first national Colloquial Poetry Festival.  Leadership  Very similar to tribal leadership, the Aladhadh have an Amid. This position is akin to an elected shiekh. The members of the clan tacitly vote on the leadership by appealing to Amid to represent them. The Amid of the clan was Dr. Naim Aladhadh. A secularist, educated at Caltech and MIT, and well liked, Dr. Naim Aladhadh was considered by many inside and outside of Iraq, particularly in the U.S., to be a suitable replacement for Saddam Hussein. His efforts to topple Saddam's regime resulted in his assassination in 1992. To avoid backlash, the assassination was disguised as a car accident.Iraqi National Accord newspaper, edited by Dr. Ayad Allawi, March 1992 Dr. Naim Aladhadh established the Human Rights Foundation in the University of North Wales in 1964. During the late seventies Naim Aladhadh was a leading figure in establishing the National Computer Center in Iraq (\\"Almarkaz Alqowmi Lilhasibat\\"). He was also the Cochair of the Council for The Transfer of Technology. His numerous contributions to Iraq's development earned him the fame name \\"aldoctor\\" meaning The Doctor. In 1988, after the end of the Iraq-Iran war, he was transferred to the Ministry of Higher Education as a lecturer in one of his fields of academic speciality, electrical engineering. Later, he joined the UN/ UNESCO, as on Economic development advisor. At that time, he became active in a move to topple Saddam Hussein. He had contacted Dr. Ayad Allawi to help with his revolutionary efforts. Dr. Alawi later became Prime Minister when he foiled Saddam's issued order to assassinate both men. In 1992, on an empty highway between Iraq and Jordan a staged traffic accident took the life of Dr. Aladhadh.Alsabah Newspaper,London March 1992, Published By Ayad Allawi After his death, the leadership was not clearly transferred. It may have been in the hands of Kamel Aladahdh, a UNESCO/U.N Economist living in Qatar. Though his emigration from the country has affected his leadership status, Kamel is still a respected elder of the clan. After the fall of Hussien's regime, many considered Dr. Ali Aladhadh a candidate to lead the clan. A contributor to Iraq's liberation, Ali Aladhadh and a long time oppose to Saddam's regime. He was ambushed with his pregnant wife on his way to the hospital in 2006 by Iraqi insurgents. Many blame the leadership for notproviding security to such a senior member of the party. His death was another significant loss to the clan. Representing the Adhamia area of Baghdad is Ryadh Aladhadh. A doctor and a philanthropist, he has spoken against Long term American presence and against violence in Iraq. His life is the centerpiece of the documentary My Country, My Country.

Net or netting is any textile in which the yarns are fused, looped or knotted at their intersections, resulting in a fabric with open spaces between the yarns. Net has many uses, and comes in different varieties. Depending on the type of yarn or filament that is used to make up the textile, its characteristics can vary from durable to not durable.  Uses  People use net for many different occupations. Netting is one of the key components to fishing in mass quantities. This textile is used because of its sturdy yet flexible origin, which can carry weight yet, still be lightweight and compactable. Fisherman use netting when trawling, because it is sturdy enough to carry large amounts of weight as fish are trapped, pulled, then lifted out of water. Oftentimes, the filaments that make up the yarn are coated with wax or plastic. This coating adds a waterproof component to the textile that provides even more reliability. Net is also used in medical practices to provide fabric insulation and wrapping under an industry standard sling. In the medical practice, netting provides cushion and protection, when used in layers, but still allows the skin to breathe under the fabric. Depending on what the netting is being used for, a different wax or plastic coating can be applied in order to cover the filaments that use up the yarn. Filaments can be made from synthetic or natural fibres, but that is all up to the manufacturer when deciphering what the textiles future entails. When netting is going to be exposed to water or heat often, manufacturers consider that and apply what best fits that textile. Net is commonly used in camping tents. Air can easily pass through the holes, which allows breathability that doesn‚Äôt trap bacteria, and remain impermeable to pests and insects. Netting is often used for luggage bags to create transparent, breathable compartments that allow people to store items. Netting has many similar components to mesh, as they both allow air to pass through easily, and share a lot of the same uses. Bigger woven knits have varying different uses, and smaller, tighter woven knits are varied as well.  Types = Hand-made netting  Hand- made or machine-made net is used as the foundation fabric for many kinds of needlework, including Filet lace and tambour lace. Netting can be used for many things. This includes adding fullness to a dress. Most commonly wedding and prom dresses. It is also used for many costumes, including fairy outfits. Netting can also be used to make tutus for dancing costumes. Netting can also be referred to when considering the handmade craft. Using either the Lace- maker or the Net-maker method to tie the netting knot, you can create several types of netting. Diamond mesh netting goes back and forth, in rows. This technique is used for bags, hammocks, headbands and scarves. Another type is square mesh netting which also goes back and forth in rows but is worked in the diagonal. This type of net is used for trawling. The first row starts at one corner and the last row finishes the corner diagonal to the first corner. This is often used as a foundation for lacis or net embroidery. Spiral netting is a type of netting that goes around and around in a similar manner to knitting or crochet. There‚Äôs no beginning or ending to specific rounds since the pattern is continuous and just keeps going.  Knotless netting  Different weaving patterns can be used for different kinds of netting. Depending on the use of the textile, size of the holes in the net will vary. Weaving patterns, opposed to knitting patterns, are more often used for knotless netting. Jason Mills states that, as there are no knots used to produce this kind of netting, it is usually less sturdy and movable. Each strand, when used for a knotless netting weave, can sometimes be coated before being woven to ensure more durability. If a weave is coated after being woven it can show to be more durable when exposed to heat or pressure- depending on the type of coat See also * Bobbinet * Needlerun net  References  Textiles ","title":"Net (textile)"},{"id":"9602560","text":"An omen is a phenomenon that is believed to foretell the future, often signifying the advent of change.

The school is often referred to as \\"Memo\\" by its students. History In 1929, the Council of the Township of York decided to construct a high school in memory of their youth killed in World War I. 9.5 acres were purchased for the school. Architect Charles Wellington Smith designed the building and the cornerstone was laid on May 6. The school was opened on September 3, 1929 to its first students. The Collegiate Gothic building with Don Valley Brick and smooth faded stone, consists of 15 classrooms, 3 science labs, an auditorium, cafeteria, two gyms, a swimming pool, and various offices. It was built at a cost of $250 000.https://www.acotoronto.ca/show_building.php?BuildingID=5735 The school officially opened on January 30, 1930. A World War II memorial was dedicated on February 27, 1949.https://schoolweb.tdsb.on.ca/yorkmemorial/Alumni/Our-Heritage Since the building was originally constructed in 1929, in 1954, an addition with six classrooms was added. This is followed by the construction of seven classrooms and library in 1961, followed by fourteen classrooms and pool area conversion in 1966. The next year, in 1967, a new swimming pool was built in the site of the Centennial building, with a gym and community centre. Eight rooms were converted between 1968 and 1969. The last addition, in the eastern portition, was built in 1971, currently houses the cafeteria, library, and the offices of the York school board (which are currently used by the TDSB as its continuing education offices). By 1973, fire escapes were added, space in the interior was converted for lockers. Some rooms were also converted in 1988. In 1985, the building was designated as a heritage building by the York City Council.\\"York Memorial Collegiate Institute\\". Architectural Conservancy Ontario On May 6 and 7, 2019, fires started in the YMCI building, which reached six-alarm status. The second fire caused sections of the roof and walls to collapse, as well as damage or destruction to the stained glass windows in the auditorium. All of the students were temporarily housed in nearby George Harvey Collegiate Institute. To accommodate the YMCI students for the 2019‚Äì20 school year, the TDSB selected the Scarlett Heights Entrepreneurial Academy on Royal York and Eglinton in Etobicoke, which closed its doors in 2018, as a temporary location for the school. The TTC began adjusting services on the 32 Eglinton West bus route as a result.

She sailed for a number of companies, and survived service in the First World War, only to be torpedoed and sunk by a German U-boat during the Second World War while sailing under the Mexican flag off the coast of Florida. Her sinking contributed to Mexico's decision to enter the war on the side of the Allies. Potrero del Llano was originally built by Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company, Hebburn-on-Tyne as the F.A. Tamplin, for service with T.W. Tamplin & Co., of London. She was sold in 1921 to the Belgian company SA d'Armement, d'Industrie & de Commerce, of Antwerp, and was renamed Arminco, and was sold again in 1930 to the Italian company Societ√† Italiana Transporti Petroliferi (SITP), of Genoa, and was renamed Lucifero. She was interned while docked at Tampico, in Mexico on 10 June 1940 and was seized on 8 December 1941 by the Mexican government and renamed Potrero del Llano after a town in Veracruz. She was operated by Petr√≥leos Mexicanos (Pemex), and was homeported in Tampico. Potrero del Llano was sailing unescorted from Tampico to New York City in May 1942, carrying 6,132 tons of petroleum. She was sighted by the , under Reinhard Suhren at 07:17 hours on 14 May 1942, while east of the coast of Florida. Suhren noticed an illuminated flag painted on the side of the ship but misidentified it as the Italian flag. Since only ships of the Mexican Navy were permitted to display the Mexican flag with the eagle in the centre, the flag shown by the Potrero del Llano resembled the Italian one, and having decided that the tanker's position and course meant that she could not be Italian, Suhren decided to sink her. U-564 duly torpedoed the Potrero del Llano, which sank with the loss of 13 of her crew. Twenty-two survivors were picked up by and taken to Miami. One of the survivors, Jos√© Reyes Sosa, survived another attack on SS Las Choapas, a tanker sunk by on 27 June 1942, and the fourth Mexican tanker sunk by German submarines.

The band members were university music students, for the most part. Under saxophonist Dewar's direction they brought to pre-1930 jazz compositions a precision born of studying classical and modern orchestral music. They achieved a discipline that, combined with their youthful enthusiasm, distinguished them from the far looser, laid-back style of traditional jazz bands labeled as Dixieland. One distinctive aspect of their style was the use of a bass saxophone instead of a string double bass to anchor the band's rhythm section. In this, and in their name, the Memphis Nighthawks prefigured the later Nighthawks Orchestra of New York City, led by Vince Giordano. Personnel included Dewar on soprano saxophone and clarinet, Steve Jensen on cornet, Joel Helleny on trombone, Dave Feinman on the above- mentioned bass sax, Mike Miller on banjo and guitar and sometimes Bob Kornacher on drums. Recordings included the albums Jazz Lips on the Delmark label and Live at the Stabilizer on Golden Crest. Delmark Records released Jazz Lips for the first time on CD in November 2009. Previously unissued takes are included. Dewar now plays and teaches in Chicago. Miller is an active guitar and banjo player in Champaign, Illinois. Jensen died in July 1997. Feinman plays guitar and bass guitar and lives in Long Island, New York. Kornacher is in St.Louis and Helleny died in September 2009.

The Games were the thirteenth to be held since the inception of the South Pacific Games in 1963, and included traditional multi-sport event disciplines, such as athletics and swimming, alongside region-specific and smaller events such as outrigger canoeing, surfing and lawn bowls. The principal venue for the Games was Apia Park, with other events taking place at the Faleata Sporting Complex and at other locations around Samoa. The cost of the games was reported to be US$92 million, and resulted in significant government debt for Samoa due to infrastructure projects which included replacement bridges and roads. Sports There were 33 sports contested at this edition of the games: Opening ceremony The opening ceremony took place on 25 August 2007 at Apia Park Stadium and was performed in a traditional Samoan and Pacific style, welcoming some 5,000 athletes from 22 nations and territories to Samoa. The ceremony was attended by Tuilaepa Aiono Sailele Malielegaoi, Prime Minister of Samoa (who also competed in the Games - see below), and Tuiatua Tupua Tamasese Efi, Head of State. Choreographed by Samoan contemporary dancer Alan Aiolupotea the ceremony featured dancing portraying the \\"mystical legends\\" from Samoa's island heritage (such as the stories of Sina and the Eel and Nafanua) with a five-year-old female fire dancer from Siumu Village performing a siva afi (or fire stick dance) accompanied by a Samoan song depicting the flow of lava following the 1905 eruptions near Savai'i being one of the showcase displays. Former New Zealand Idol winner Rosita Vai sang an accompaniment to the torch lighting of the ceremonial flame by Ofisa Ofisa, a Samoan weightlifter.Fire, Dance and Song Bring in the Games from Samoa2007.ws Following a rest day on Sunday, the sporting events of the Games began on Monday, 27 August. Participation by Samoan Prime Minister Samoan Prime Minister Tuilaepa Aiono Sailele Malielegaoi competed for his country at the Games in the sport of target archery. In participating in the Games, the Prime Minister became the first elected leader to represent his country at a multi-sport event. Having taken up the sport only 5 months prior to the Games, Tuilaepa was ranked second in Samoa in the combined bow discipline. The Prime Minister's son was also a reserve team member. On day 10 of the Games, Tuilaepa won a silver medal in the mixed recurve team play event. Logistical problems Problems with equipment and the lack of multi-sport event infrastructures within the region created difficulties throughout the Games. The decathlon was reduced to eight disciplines due to a shortage of equipment. The poles for the pole vault were still in Melbourne after the ship due to deliver them was delayed by poor weather and the high jump was the discipline cancelled to allow the event to comply with IAAF regulations (there is no IAAF-sanctioned nine discipline event). In addition, the 1500 metre race was reduced to 1 km. The women's 400-metre hurdles and men's discus were also affected.Athletes feel robbed after decathlon becomes octathlon from Niu FM, Pacific Radio News 4 September 2007 The lack of funding and facilities for drug testing also restricted the ability of Games authorities to run a full drug testing and anti-doping programme at the Games. Only one hundred athletes (primarily in high-risk events such as bodybuilding and weightlifting) were due to be tested as samples needed to be flown overseas from Samoa to be processed at a cost of A$500 per sample.New Mindset needed to keep Games clean from Niu FM, Pacific Radio News 6 September 2007 Fireworks due to feature in the Closing Ceremony also remained in Melbourne after difficulties transporting them by ship to Samoa. Religious controversies The religious sensitivities of the host nation (which is primarily Congregationalist Christian) and other participants resulted in several controversial decisions during the organisation and running of the Games. Athletes in the women's beach volleyball event were required to wear shorts and T-shirts as opposed to the regulation bikini-style outfits to avoid offending family members and other spectators. A leaked internal memo by Team Samoa authorities was circulated prior to the event warning Samoan athletes not to engage in homosexual intercourse declaring it as \\"ungodly\\", stating: \\"do not embarrass yourself, your family and your country by trying this in the village...Best not to even think about this. It's against the law of God!\\" Such activity is prohibited under Samoan law and punishable by up to five years' imprisonment. However, the ban on homosexual intercourse was later lifted by organising committee chairman Tapasu Lueng Wai. A campaign to issue athletes condoms and advice on sexually transmitted infections also met with resistance from religious leaders. The Archbishop of the Catholic Church in Samoa, Alapati Mataeliga suggested that, in doing so, the authorities were encouraging extra-marital sexual activity which was frowned upon by the church. Games authorities also back-tracked on plans to issue athletes with female condoms after fears it might \\"expose young athletes to sex.\\" Male condoms were nevertheless distributed. Closing ceremony The closing ceremony for the Games again took place at Apia Park. Attended by some 20,000 spectators, a twelve-minute fireworks display brought proceedings to an end before hundreds of balloons were released in the colours of the Games flag which was itself duly lowered and the ceremonial flame extinguished. The flag was then passed to New Caledonia delegates, supported by a Kanak cultural group, ahead of the 2011 Pacific Games in Noumea.

A significant amount of the pre-Games expenditure was spent on building new facilities and upgrading those already in existence in Samoa. The majority of the new facilities were sited at the Faleata Sports Complex at Tuana'imato. However, many Samoans feared the size of the complex and other construction would lead to the venues becoming significant white elephants after the Games were over.Samoa stays focused on finishing line - Host wants to farewell SPG in style by Peter Rees, IslandsBusiness.com *Aganoa Beach - Surfing *Apia Park Sports Complex ::Gymnasium - Table Tennis and Badminton ::Stadium - Athletics, Rugby Union and Touch Football ::Netball Courts - Netball ::Tennis Courts - Tennis *Fagalii - Royal Samoa Golf Course - Golf *Faleata Sports Complex ::Samoa Aquatic Centre - Swimming ::Archery Field - Archery ::Baseball Field - Baseball ::Beach Volleyball Courts - Beach Volleyball ::Toleafoa S.

They design and manufacture both traditional slides and innovative rides such as water coasters, funnel-shaped TORNADO slides, and Bowl slides. ProSlide has received attention for being the first water slide manufacturer to build a water slide using linear induction motors and for designing the Mammoth watercoaster which was named the world's longest watercoaster by Guinness World Records in 2016. Since 1986, ProSlide has developed and designed water rides for water parks in over 40 countries around the world. History=Corporate history After being a member of Canada‚Äôs alpine skiing team from 1969 to 1974, Richard D. Hunter founded ProSlide Technology Inc. in 1986. In 1990, Hunter purchased Mont Cascades, a ski area and waterpark in Quebec. Mont Cascades has since served as a research and development area where Proslide tests new ride ideas. In 2007, ProSlide purchased a 100-acre plot of land in Ottawa where it has been developing the Alottawata waterpark. The park is expected to open in summer 2019 and will serve in part as a research and development centre for the company. Attraction history ProSlide debuted three types of water slides in 1987, Twisters, Kidz, and Plummets, which are all types of body flumes. The first Twisters opened at Mont Saint-Sauveur in Quebec and Adventure World Theme Park (now known as Six Flags America) in Largo, Maryland, United States; both parks opened 4 Twisters that year. Plummets consist of a vertical drop only, followed by a long, flat segment to help riders decelerate. The first Plummets opened at Aquapar Magog in Quebec and Six Flags America, respectively. ProSlide also debuted their children's water slides (ProSlide Kidz) in 1987, which are miniature versions of Twisters designed for young children. Initially, they were installed more frequently than the full-size Twisters. In 1989, the company's PIPEline water slides opened at several locations. The Pipeline is a water slide that carries riders on 1-to-3 person inner tubes and is ProSlide's second most common style. The Pipeline has both open and enclosed sections; many have water curtains at the beginning and/or end of their enclosed sections. The first Pipeline rides using inner tubes opened at Fantasia de Agua in the Dominican Republic and Waldameer Park in Erie, Pennsylvania. Throughout the 1990s, several large park chains started opening new ProSlide Pipelines, including Cedar Fair, Six Flags, and Wet 'n Wild. In 1991, the Mammoth waterslide debuted and was the first ProSlide slide that riders rode in 4-person tubes. The Mammoth is a larger-scale version of the Pipeline. Wet 'n Wild in Orlando, Florida, opened the first ProSlide Mammoth. The first ProSlide RACER opened in 1994 at ProSlide's Mont Cascades Waterpark in Cantley, Quebec. Racers consist of one wide slide with dividers between the lanes and are designed that riders can \\"race\\" to the finish if ride operators send all of them down the slide at the same time. Beginning in the late 1990s, ProSlide began manufactures four kinds of Bowls: ProBowls, CannonBOWLS, BulletBOWLS, and BehemothBOWLS, all four types consist of an enclosed flume that terminates in a bowl; riders travel in a spiral around the bowl (using centrifugal force to stay on the bowl's wall initially) before dropping into a splashdown pool. ProBowls are enclosed body flumes which end in a bowl with an open top. CannonBowls and the larger BehemothBowls accommodate 2- and 4-person inner tubes, and have a common exit in their centers. Sky Drop, at Plopsaqua, a slide with SkyBOX. Aerial view of the Tornado at Darien Lake. The first ProSlide Bowl, a ProBowl, opened at Golfland Sunsplash in 1999. In the early 2000s, ProSlide gained recognition for its TORNADO, a 4-passenger, 50- to 75-foot-tall enclosed slide which ends in a large, often multicolored funnel. Riders travel back and forth in the funnel several times before exiting into a splashdown pool. The first Tornados opened in 2003 at Six Flags New England, Mountain Creek Waterpark and Holiday World and Splashin' Safari. In 2005, ProSlide debuted its waterslide version of a roller coaster, the Rocket, an uphill water coaster. Proslide's first Rockets opened at Noah's Ark Water Park, Six Flags New England, and the Great Wolf Lodge. ProSlide opened a LIM- propelled Rocket at the Great Wolf Lodge near Kings Island in 2006; in 2007, LIM-launched Rockets opened at Naju Lake Waterpark in Korea and at Kentucky Kingdom. Super Tubes Hydrocoaster at WhiteWater World in Australia, have used the ProSlide HydroMagnetics system of Linear Induction Motors placed throughout the ride to launch riders up the uphill sections. HydroMagnetics uses Force Engineering LIM technology, which first gained recognition in the amusement park industry as the power behind launched roller coasters such as Flight of Fear and Speed - The Ride. ProSlide HydroMAGNETIC ROCKETS are the first waterslides to use this same technology, which allows for more flexibility and efficiency in running the waterslides' uphill sections than the previous conveyor-belt system did.\\"New water park brings slide innovation\\", retrieved January 21, 2006 In 2012, the company's Mammoth was recognized as the longest water coaster in the world when it opened at Holiday World.

Grandchildren Holly, Brad, Doug, Timothy, Michael, Andrew and Jonathan are all employees of CoorsTek. Brewing career After graduation, he began work in the Coors Porcelain Co., the porcelain business that helped the company survive Prohibition. With his brother William Coors (whose desks were located only one foot apart), Joseph refined the cold-filtered beer manufacturing system and began America's first large-scale recycling program by offering one-cent returns on Coors aluminum cans. He served one term as a regent of the University of Colorado from 1967 to 1972, attempting to quell what he considered to be campus radicalism during the Vietnam war. He served as president of Coors from 1977 to 1985, and chief operating officer from 1980 to 1988. His leadership helped expand Coors beer distribution from 11 Western states in the 1970s to the entire United States by the early 1990s. Politics Coors was perhaps best known for his conservative politics and his support of Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan, whom he first met in Palm Springs, California in 1967. His brother William Coors once described him as \\"a little bit right of Attila the Hun\\". A founding member of the conservative Washington Heritage Foundation think tank in 1973 along with Paul Weyrich and Edwin Feulner (which formulated many of Reagan's campaign ideas), Coors provided $250,000 to cover its first year budget, and $300,000/year thereafter. He was also involved with the founding of the Free Congress Foundation and the Council for National Policy. He was a member of Ronald Reagan's Kitchen Cabinet after helping finance Reagan's political career as governor of California and U.S. president, and was later nominated by Reagan to sit on the board of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Brewery Workers Local 366 in Golden, Colorado struck the Coors plant in August 1977. Coors continued brewery operations and replaced the striking workers who stayed out. The new workers voted to decertify the union in December 1978, officially ending the strike. The strike and decertification caused a 10-year boycott of Coors by the AFL-CIO. In the aftermath of the strike Coors required new employees to take lie detector tests, which were discontinued in August 1986. In 1977 after a regional agreement prevented the movement of toxic aluminum waste from aluminum can production across adjacent state borders, Coors set up the Mountain States Legal Foundation, headed by local lawyer James G. Watt to fight the environmental constraints in the courts. Watt later became U.S. Secretary of the Interior, and appointed local attorney Anne Gorsuch as head of the Environmental Protection Agency to dismantle toxic waste disposal laws, causing an outcry that got her sacked by Reagan after 22 months, after which Watt was forced to resign for politically-insensitive remarks. Coors was also known to have privately donated $65,000 to buy a light cargo plane for the Contras' effort in Nicaragua during Reagan's presidency. That donation went through National Security Council adviser Oliver North.Blanchard, William H. Neocolonialism American Style, 1960-2000. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood P, 1996.

Lewis (University of Vermont) and subsequently developed by Professor Sam H. Ham (University of Idaho). In the thematic approach, an interpreter relies on a central theme (i.e., a major point or message) to guide development of a communication activity or device. In presenting the activity or device, the thematic interpreter develops the theme in such a way that it will be highly relevant to an audience. According to studies, presenting a strongly relevant theme greatly increases the likelihood an interpreter will succeed in provoking an audience to think about theme-related issues. Beginning in the early 2000s, the thematic approach has been adopted widely in persuasive communication campaigns aimed at impacting environmental behaviors, especially those related to energy and water consumption, and in occupational safety and risk communication programs. In the broader fields of sustainable development and risk communication, the term thematic communication (rather than thematic \\"interpretation\\") is often used. The two approaches, however, are identical, and both are linked largely to Ham's (1992) book, Environmental Interpretation.  History  The thematic approach to interpretation was popularized in the book Environmental Interpretation (1992) by Dr. Sam H. Ham (University of Idaho) which has become standard reading for many students of interpretation and interpretive tour guiding. Prior to Dr. Ham's book, two additional contributors to the field of Interpretation are its founder, Freeman Tilden and his book, Interpreting Our Heritage (1957) and Dr. Grant W. Sharpe (University of Washington) and his work, Interpreting the Environment. Ham formally presented the thematic approach for the first time in his 1992 book, wherein he outlined the \\"EROT\\" (Enjoyable, Relevant, Organized, Thematic) framework. Drawing heavily on persuasive communication research, Ham refined the EROT framework in the early 2000s and renamed it the TORE model of thematic interpretation. The most detailed presentation of the TORE model is in Interpretation-- Making a difference on purpose which Ham published in 2013. There are obvious parallels between Ham's view of thematic interpretation and those of Freeman Tilden who is widely considered the founder of the field of interpretation. The most important parallel is that both see interpretation as a process aimed at provoking audiences to do their own thinking and thereby develop their own subjective understanding of the world. This is in contrast to the view that interpretation instructs audiences to know or accept the interpreter's understanding of things. Both Tilden and Ham appear to be strongly influenced by the views of constructivist learning theorists--with Tilden influenced by John Dewey, and Ham influenced by cognitive constructivist Jean Piaget and social constructivist Lev Vygotsky. In the spirit of constructivist learning theory, Dewey, Piaget, and Vygotsky saw learning as the result of knowledge that is created inside a learner's own head, rather than being \\"put\\" there by an educator. Both Tilden, and later, Ham, advocated a very similar view in the field of interpretation. According to both of them, when interpretation is strongly relevant to its audience, it is likely to provoke thinking and elaboration.  Practice  In everyday reality, the practice of thematic interpretation involves theme-based communication by interpretive naturalists, zoo and museum educators, guides, docents, park rangers, and other communicators in natural and cultural settings. Typically interpreters are required to present complex and potentially dry subject matter to non- technical voluntary audiences (often consisting of tourists) in an interesting and engaging way. The thematic approach can involve any method that increases the relevance of an interpreter's theme to an audience, for example, comparisons, analogies and stories that link unfamiliar things to the things an audience already cares about.  Alternate uses  Thematic interpretation also refers to an event in some high school competitive speech leagues such as the California High School Speech Association and the National Christian Forensics and Communications Association. \\"TIers\\" present multiple \\"cuttings\\" from published works on a common theme; they can be of humorous and/or dramatic intent. The entire speech including an introduction and transitions should not exceed ten minutes. Contestants are judged based on the appropriateness of their selections and their portrayal of the characters. Another defining characteristic of Thematic Interpretation is the use of a single binder, containing the literature, as a prop.

It served the former private branch line to Newnes. The station closed to passenger services in 1975, although it still physically exists and is occasionally used for coal trains visiting the nearby Clarence Colliery. The station consists of an island 'Up' platform, and a single side 'Down' platform.  History  The first station was finished around 1906 at the time of the Newnes railway line. This station was located at the junction of the Dargans Creek deviation and the Newnes railway line (or Wolgan Valley Railway) which is situated about north west of the current Newnes Junction Station. After the Zig Zag deviation was completed the station was no longer needed for passenger services but stayed in use to finalise the recovery of parts from the Zig Zag and Clarence area along the Dargans Deviation. The second station (also called \\"Newnes Junction') replaced the earlier station which operated from 1906 to 1910. The Wolgan Valley Railway closed in 1932 and for years the station had no use at all until the construction of the loop line that served the Clarence Colliery in the 1970s. In 1957 electrification crossed the Blue Mountains and the sidings and colliery loop were electrified. In 2006 the overhead catenary was decommissioned and was removed from the colliery balloon loop. The station was burnt to the ground resulting from the 2019 Gospers Mountain fire.

It was first published in If: Worlds of Science Fiction in June 1957, and reprinted in the 1975 collection Buy Jupiter and Other Stories. Gold Key Comics also published a comic book version of the story in 1976 in #4 of the four issue science fiction series Starstream: Adventures in Science Fiction. It also appeared in 1976's Questar: Illustrated Science Fiction Classics, published by Golden Press and adapted by A. Moniz with artwork from Jack Abel and in 1975 in Buy Jupiter and Other Stories. Plot summary An ovum is deposited on pre-human Earth by an alien race and in due course it gives birth to a creature that takes the form of a human. Over the centuries, the creature lives amongst humans and mentally influences certain of them to advance the development of civilization. In particular, it works on scientists and eventually it causes the development of space travel. As the first spaceship to attempt to reach the moon is being built, the creature, now known as Kane, causes the creation of a small space in the ship, which he enters, unknown to the builders. The ship leaves Earth and at the appropriate point, Kane departs from the ship and, now fully developed, travels unaided to its home planet. The author draws an analogy between Kane and a bee that visits and thereby pollinates flowers at random, with no real knowledge of what it has done.  Comic adaptation plot summary  The illustrated adaptation by Moniz and Abel differs from the original short in that the comic is told largely from the perspective of the rocket scientist, Dr. Hammer, who is introduced as he struggles with an impossible math problem related to an upcoming launch. On several occasions, stargazing janitor Kane causes the frustrated doctor to have a sudden epiphany which allows him to progress in the launch effort. After realizing Kane is always around when he has these moments of insight, Hammer confronts Kane and learns of Kane's 8,000 year history of \\"assisting\\" scientists and inventors to make historic breakthroughs ‚Äì all apparently to advance humanity's effort into exploring space. Unexpectedly, Kane himself does not have any understanding of how or why he has been doing this, nor familiarity with the scientific breakthroughs he's inspired. Kane feels compelled to enter the special man-sized room Dr. Hammer had inadvertently designed in the rocket just before launch, and once arriving in open space, transforms into his adult alien form.

A tryout is similar to a workshop production in that the point is to identify and eliminate embarrassing flaws before the production is put on before highly demanding New York or London audiences, but unlike a workshop, it is usually more developed, less rough, and closer to the intended final product. If a tryout goes well and irons out the last few bugs, then that assures the project's investors that when it does debut on Broadway or the West End, it will already be fully polished and more likely to receive favorable reviews and play to sold-out houses for several years, so they can recoup their investment. Conversely, tryouts enable theatrical audiences in less prestigious markets to preview potential future hits and get bragging rights that they saw those works first.

Range It is found in Angola, Botswana, the DRCongo, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. It is a common rodent which is diurnal by nature. Appearance Its total length is 350 mm, half of which is tail. This species only weighs 200 g. The coat colour varies throughout the region. In the western and arid parts of its range, it is pale grey, and in the eastern localities, more brown. Its head and legs are a rusty colour. Colouration on the chest varies from yellowish to buff in the east, to white in the west. This squirrel's belly is white. These alert and ever busy creatures carry their long tails extended backwards. Diet Smith's bush squirrels are primarily vegetarian, but like most rodents, they take insect prey and use their front feet to manipulate food items when feeding. They scatter-hoard seeds next to tree trunks or grass tufts, thereby facilitating tree regeneration. Breeding Essentially arboreal animals, they also spend a great deal of time on the ground, foraging for food. When disturbed, Smith's bush squirrels always seek the refuge of trees. At night, territorial family groups nest together in holes in trees. Offspring become sexually mature between six and nine months old, when they are forcibly evicted by the breeding pair. The males are mainly responsible for territorial defense, although females also chase intruders when they care for dependent pups. To promote group cohesion, a common scent is shared by mutual grooming, which is an important facet of the social fibre of this species. Smith's bush squirrels are diligent in their grooming and a mother tree squirrel holds her offspring down with her fore legs while grooming it with licks, nibbles, and scratches with her claws. Defense strategies A conspicuous feature of their behaviour when under threat is 'mobbing': all the members of the colony make harsh clicking sounds while they flick their tails, building up momentum and gradually getting louder. In some areas, they are solitary, or are found in small family groups; a lone tree squirrel relies on its wits when in danger and always keeps a branch or the trunk of a tree between it and the enemy. Smith's bush squirrels are always alert, and when alarmed, run away with great speed, making for the nearest tree where they lie motionless, flattened against a branch.

The Carnival of Viareggio () is a carnival event annually held in the Tuscan city of Viareggio, in Italy. It is considered amongst the most renowned carnival celebrations in both Italy and Europe. thumb Overview Its main characteristic is given by the parade of floats and masks, usually made of paper-pulp, depicting caricatures of popular people, such as politicians, showmen and sportsmen; the parade is held on the Viareggio avenue located alongside the local beach. After almost a century and a half, the Viareggio Carnival carries on its vibrant traditions having become one of Europe‚Äôs longest-established festivals and undoubtedly Italy‚Äôs best known event. Every year, the Carnevale di Viareggio attracts more than 500.000 spectators who gaily crowd the city‚Äôs boardwalk as they admire the breath-taking parades of papier-m√¢ch√© gargantuan floats. The first Viareggio carnival parade was held in 1873, when some wealthy middle-class men decided to organize a parade of floats adorned with flowers; a number of local citizens, as a sign of protest, then decided to put on masks in order to show their refusal of high taxes they were forced to pay. The first float to win the parade, in 1883, was named I Quattro Mori (The Four Moors), an accurately representation of the homonymous Livorno statue. The official mascot of the Viareggio carnival is Burlamacco, first depicted in 1931 by Uberto Bonetti. Since 2001, all the floats are built in an apposite seat, called Cittadella del Carnevale (Carnival Citadel), located on the northern side of the Viareggio city territory. Carnival celebrations are scheduled every weekend night in the city's different quarters or Rioni with the best known bars, restaurants, discos and hotels in Versilia hosting all-night colourful masked parties. Additionally, during the four-week celebration, plays in vernacular language are staged around the city. A month-long unique opportunity for the citizens of Viareggio to strengthen their sense of identity and to be reborn under the sign of Burlamacco, the official mask of the Carnevale di Viareggio. What makes the Carnevale di Viareggio one of a kind are its papier-m√¢ch√© gargantuan allegorical floats with the largest ones towering 70 feet or 20 meters over the crowds and weighing about 40 tons. A stunning parade that is similar to the Ancient Triumphs held in the Renaissance and that highlights the great yacht and sailboat building skills which are still at the heart of Viareggio‚Äôs tradition. Veritable moving theatres, these allegorical papier-m√¢ch√© floats are the product of the unequalled creativity blended with the extraordinary sculpture and painting skills of the city‚Äôs magical craftsmen; and represent the highest expression of this popular art, now world renown. The Carnival Giant Float Parades take place along a 2 kilometre ring set aside Viareggio‚Äôs Liberty-era boardwalk, best known as La Passeggiata. Spectators can admire the works of art up close becoming themselves a part of the cheerful parade. During this period, Viareggio and it‚Äôs Passeggiata become a true open air Museum where people from all over the world come together to celebrate Carnival. Parades also include traditional music bands and performers competing for the prize of most original masks. A fun-filled mix of excitement, culture and tradition in a wide ranging entertainment program for both children and adults. The Tuscan city of Viareggio is also known as the Pearl of the Tyrrhenian Sea for its long sandy beaches, its pinewood groves and beautiful promenade. It is the perfect natural stage for Carnival with the Apuan Alps and Art Deco seaside villas serving as a unique backdrop. A month- long Carnival celebration that attracts thousands of spectators from Viareggio, from Italy and from abroad. In 1925, for the very first time, local sculptor Antonio d'Arliano employed the paper mould technique on iron and wood scaffolding, thus changing forever the way the structure of Carnival floats would be made. Since then, the use of papier-m√¢ch√© has become an integral element in the construction of these giant allegorical floats. Today, this knowledge, is handed down from father to son who are in turn happy to share their knowledge with those who wish to hone in their skills in this field. thumb The Cittadella The impressive complex of the Cittadella del Carnevale di Viareggio was inaugurated in 2001 and is the largest and most important Italian thematic center dedicated to carnival floats and masks. It houses sixteen large hangars and workshops where the giant floats are built, a laboratory where the art of papier-m√¢ch√© is taught, three museum areas and a historical photo and film archive and documentation center. At the Citadel of the Carnevale di Viareggio it is possible to visit the Papier M√¢ch√© Museum where the breathtaking floats are stored and the Museum of the Carnival that illustrates the over 100-year old history of the Carnevale through original documents, photographs, sketches, posters and models.

It appeared in the May 1968 issue of Analog Science Fiction and Fact and was included in the 1975 collection Buy Jupiter and Other Stories. The serialization of his novelization of Fantastic Voyage in The Saturday Evening Post in 1966 filled Asimov with the ambition to publish an original story there before the magazine ceased publication. He therefore wrote \\"Exile to Hell\\" in June 1967. The Post rejected the story, though, just as they would have in their heyday twenty years before (as Asimov noted in In Joy Still Felt). It then occurred to Asimov that he had not submitted a story to Analog since Thiotimoline and the Space Age in 1960. The story was accepted, and appeared in the May 1968 issue. In Asimov's introduction to the story in Buy Jupiter and Other Stories, he notes that when the story first appeared in Analog, the pre-story blurb by editor John W. Campbell spoiled the story by telegraphing the ending. Plot summary A man named Jenkins is put on trial after accidentally damaging a computer system that potentially could have a disastrous effect on the totally computerized underground society in which he lives. The trial, which is carried out by computers programmed with prosecution and defence arguments, finds Jenkins guilty of equipment damage, a major crime by the society's laws. He is sentenced to permanent exile, a punishment considered harsher than execution. Only at the end of the story is it revealed that the society is built beneath the surface of the Moon, with a totally conditioned and computer-controlled environment, and that the place of exile is on the surface of the Earth.

A merchant submarine is a type of submarine intended for trade, and being without armaments, it is not considered a warship like most other types of submarines. The intended use would be blockade running, or to dive under Arctic ice. Strictly speaking, only two submarines have so far been purpose-built for non-military merchant shipping use, outside of criminal enterprises, though standard or partly converted military submarines have been used to transport smaller amounts of important cargo, especially during wartime, and large-scale proposals for modern merchant submarines have been produced by manufacturers. Criminal enterprises have also built transport submarines to avoid authorities, such as narcosubs. Germany Only two merchant submarines were built, both in Germany during World War I. They were constructed to slip through the naval blockade of the Entente Powers, mainly enforced by the efforts of the United Kingdom's Royal Navy. The British blockade had led to great difficulties for German companies in acquiring those raw materials which were not found in quantity within the German sphere of influence, and thus was hindering the German war efforts substantially. The submarines were built in 1916 by a private shipping company created for the enterprise, the Deutsche Ozean-Reederei, a subsidiary company of the North German Lloyd shipping company (now Hapag-Lloyd) and Deutsche Bank. They were intended to travel the route from Germany to the neutral US, bringing back required raw materials. As the US would not profit enough from receiving German currency, the ships were to carry trade goods both ways. Britain soon protested with the US against the use of submarines as merchant ships, arguing that they could not be stopped and inspected for munitions in the same manner as other vessels. The US, under diplomatic pressure for supposedly showing favoritism while having declared itself neutral, rejected the argument. Even submarines, as long as they were unarmed, were to be regarded as merchant vessels and accordingly would be permitted to trade.German Submarine Deutschland's Atlantic Crossing (information & speech transcript via the 'FirstWorldWar.com' private website) Deutschland Deutschland had a carrying capacity of 700 tons (much of it outside the pressure hull), and could travel at on the surface and while submerged. It had a crew of 29 men and was commanded by Paul K√∂nig, a former surface merchantman captain. On its first journey to the US, departing on the 23 June 1916, Deutschland carried 163 tons of highly sought-after chemical dyes, as well as medical drugs and mail. Passing undetected through the English Channel she arrived in Baltimore on the 8 July 1916 and soon re-embarked with 348 tons of rubber, 341 tons of nickel, and 93 tons of tin, arriving back in Bremerhaven on 25 August 1916. She had traveled , though only of these submerged. The American submarine pioneer Simon Lake had unsuccessfully negotiated to construct cargo submarines for Kaiserliche Marine prior to the war, and attempted to block Deutschlands return to Germany by raising patent infringement allegations. Lake was placated when a Krupp representative and a Norddeutscher Lloyd agent suggested Lake built 5,000-ton merchant submarines for them in the United States. The profit from the journey was 17.5 million Reichsmarks, more than four times the construction cost,See German version of this article at Handels-U-Boot (German). Some references not yet available in English. mainly because of the high prices of the patented, highly concentrated dyes, which would have cost US dollars per pound adjusted for inflation.The Submarine \\"Deutschland\\" (from the 'ColorantsHistory.org' website. Accessed 2008-08-20.) In return, the raw materials brought back covered the needs of the German war industry for several months. A second journey in October-December of the same year was also successful, again trading chemicals, medicines and gems for rubber, nickel, alloys and tin. However, Deutschland was lightly damaged during a collision with a tug in New London. Following his return, captain Paul K√∂nig wrote a book (or possibly had it ghostwritten) about the journeys of Deutschland. The book was heavily publicized, as it was intended to sway public opinion in both Germany and the US.Directed Readings on the U-Boat War - Blake, Sam; East Carolina University, April 2003. A third journey, planned for January 1917, was aborted after the US entered the war against Germany. The declaration of war had been partly due to US anger over the actions of German submarines sinking shipping bound for Great Britain, sometimes just outside American territorial waters (See ). Deutschland was taken over by the German Imperial Navy and converted into the submarine cruiser (U-Kreuzer) (a type of submarine with added artillery to fight when surfaced). It was successful in three war cruises, sinking 43 ships. After the war it was taken to England as a war trophy in December 1918. Scrapped in 1921, the boat's history ended with five workers dying due to an explosion ripping apart the sub during dismantling. Bremen A second merchant submarine, the sister ship of Deutschland, launched its first journey in August 1916 under Karl Schwartzkopf, but never arrived in the US. Its fate was never decisively uncovered, though she may have collided with the British armed merchant cruiser south of Iceland, as was theorized after the war.HMS Mantua Aux 1914-8-5 (datasheet on 'Clyde Warships', private shipbuilding history site) There was also the theory that she might have hit a mine off the Orkney Islands.The U-151 Class, U-Kreuzer (from the SteelNavy.com website) Other boats Six further merchant submarines were in the process of being built by the Deutsche Ozean-Reederei when the US entered the war in early 1917. The construction of the merchant submarines was subsequently halted or changed into submarine cruisers, similar to the fate of Deutschland. When hostilities between Germany and the United States halted Simon Lake's attempts to build merchant submarines for Germany, Lake approached the United States Shipping Board with a proposal to build one- hundred merchant submarines to alleviate shipping losses being suffered from unrestricted submarine warfare. In World War II, Germany used Milk Cow submarines to refuel its hunter U-boats in the Atlantic. As these boats were part of Kriegsmarine (Nazi Germany's navy), did carry light armaments (anti- aircraft guns), and never engaged in trade as such, they do not qualify as merchant submarines. However, they shared the large amounts of cargo space compared to normal submarines of their day. After large Italian submarines successfully transported supplies to North Africa avoiding British Mediterranean Fleet patrols, some of these submarines had their torpedo tubes and offensive deck gun armament removed to increase cargo capacity. Five of these converted submarines were seized in Axis ports for operation by German crews after the Italian armistice in September 1943.Axis Blockade Runners of World War II - Brice, Martin; Naval Institute Press, , 1981. Germany enlarged the ocean-going type IX U-boat design to an extended range type IXD1 variant with torpedo tubes removed and battery capacity reduced to increase cargo capacity for transport of strategic materials between German and Japanese ports. After the Italian submarines were converted for this cargo role, most of the extended range design were completed as an armed type IXD2 variant. Italy A 12-boat R class of 2,100-ton submarines had been designed in Italy to carry approximately 600 tons of cargo with a surface speed of and submerged speed of . A 63-man crew would operate defensive armaments of three 20 mm guns. Romolo and Remo were laid down in July 1942 at the Tosi Yard in Taranto with launch scheduled for March 1943. Ten large submarines built for combat service were also scheduled for conversion to merchant service after their designs had been found unsuitable for use against Allied convoys. These were the 880-ton Archimede, the 940-ton Barbarigo, the 951-ton Comandante Cappellini, the 1,030-ton Alpino Bagnolini and Reginaldo Giuliani, the 1,036-ton and , the 1,331-ton Enrico Tazzoli and Giuseppe Finzi, and the 1,504-ton Ammaraglio Cagni.Warships of the World ‚Äî Kafka, Roger & Pepperburg, Roy L.; Cornell Maritime Press, 1946. Conversions were to be accomplished at Bordeaux, with armament limited to defensive machine guns, while the conversion cargo capacity of 160 tons also reduced reserve buoyancy from 20‚Äì25 percent to 3.5‚Äì6 percent. Several French submarines captured at Bizerta‚Äîthe 974-ton Phoque, Requin, Espadon, and Dauphin‚Äîwere also scheduled for conversion. The ships were used on an eastbound route from Bordeaux to Singapore (then in Japanese, thus Axis, hands) with cargoes of mercury, steel and aluminum bars, welding steel, bomb prototypes, 20 mm guns, blueprints for tanks and bombsights, and up to a dozen passengers. Return trip loadings were 110-155 tons of rubber, 44-70 tons of zinc, five tons of tungsten, two tons of quinine, two tons of opium, bamboo, rattan, and passengers. Comandante Cappellini, Reginaldo Giuliani, and Enrico Tazzoli departed Bordeaux in May 1943. The first two completed their voyages in July and August, but Enrico Tazzoli was destroyed by Allied bombers in the Bay of Biscay. Barbarigo was similarly destroyed during a June departure, but Luigi Torrelli reached Singapore in August. Following the Italian armistice in September, Giuseppe Finzi and Alpino Bagnolini were seized by Germany while undergoing conversion at Bordeaux, and designated UIT-21 and UIT-22, respectively. Reginaldo Giuliani, Commandante Cappellini, and Luigi Torelli were seized by the Japanese in the East Indies, given to Germany, and designated UIT-23, UIT-24 and UIT-25, respectively. UIT-22 departed Bordeaux for Sumatra in January 1944 and was destroyed by RAF 262 Squadron Catalina bombers off South Africa in March. UIT-23 was sunk by the British submarine in February. UIT-24 departed Sumatra for Bordeaux in February, but returned to Sumatra in March after its refuelling ship was sunk. Of the other ships, Ammiraglio Cagni surrendered at South Africa following the Italian Armistice, Archimede and Leonardo da Vinci were sunk before conversion to merchant service while Romolo, Remo, and the French Phoque were sunk prior to loading. The remaining R-class submarines were not completed and conversion work ceased on the remaining three French submarines. Japan During World War II, s, s, and Type 3 submergence transport vehicles were constructed for transportation and supplying. Soviet Union The Soviet Union had plans to construct cargo submarines both during World War II and in the Cold War, but these plans were never carried out. These would not strictly count as merchant submarines, as they would have been at least lightly armed and used mainly for directly war-related duties, such as supplying troops or delivering military forces to their targets. However, in the post-Cold War period, Soviet designers also proposed purely peaceful applications. World War II In World War II, the Soviet Union used submarines (as well as other ships) to supply the besieged Crimean port of Sevastopol. The largest could transfer up to 95 tons of cargo, loading even the torpedo tubes with supplies. Around 4,000 tons were delivered by about 80 runs of 27 submarines, though Sevastopol still eventually fell.The First Soviet Giants - Polmar, Norman; book excerpts adapted for Undersea Warfare, Fall 2001, Issue 4, Volume 1 Based on this experience, the Soviet naval high command initiated a transport submarine program. A first project (Project 605) envisaged a sub that would function as a barge, towed by a standard sub. The idea was discarded due to towing difficulties. Later, a small cargo submarine design (Project 607) with a capacity of 250-300 tons of solid cargo and two folding cargo cranes was proposed. No weapons beyond two deck guns were envisaged, and the design borrowed many existing parts from the earlier VI and VI-bis submarine series to simplify construction. However, by 1943 the strategic situation had changed, and the plans were not executed. Cold War The Soviet Union envisaged and almost realized various concepts for large cargo submarines during the 1950s and 1960s, though these would not have been counted as merchant ships, being envisaged as navy landing ships to transport troops. They would have been amongst the largest submarines of their day, had they been built.  Post-Cold War  In the 1990s, the Malachite design bureau in St. Petersburg proposed submarines capable of transporting petroleum or freight containers in or through Arctic regions. It was envisaged that these ships would dive under the polar ice cap to travel directly between European and Asian ports, and possibly northern Canada, with the designers noting that: The tanker and container variants would follow the same design as standard military nuclear submarines, with the tanker variant carrying almost 30,000 tons of petroleum, to be loaded and discharged from surface or underwater terminals. The container carrier was to transport 912 standard (20-foot) freight containers, loaded within 30 hours through hatches, assisted by internal conveyance systems. However, these plans came to nothing in the hard financial straits following the Dissolution of the Soviet Union. A similar design has been proposed by the Rubin Design Bureau with the 'Submarine Cargo Vessel', a civilian redesign of the famous of the Cold War.http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/russian-navy/2003-05-typhoon-subs- to-ship-oil-and-gas A submarine freight transportation system (SFTS) was suggested in 1997 by Vladimir Postnikov and is considered as a sea-going component of a global intelligent transportation system. United States Simon Lake's merchant submarine proposal was shelved as the World War I convoy system reduced merchant shipping losses. In July and August 1942, Lake's proposals were again mentioned in Senate Subcommittee hearings regarding cargo submarines as well as cargo aircraft. Mostly it was regarding to the vital supply of aluminum from South and Central America via submarines to avoid being sunk by enemy U-boats. In 1931, with financial support from William Randolph Hearst, Lake and Sir Hubert Wilkins attempted to demonstrate potential use of merchant submarines to navigate under polar ice with a leased United States Navy submarine renamed Nautilus. Financial limitations of the Great Depression made this early attempt less successful than the post-war accomplishments of the nuclear-powered . Similar to the post-Cold War ideas of the Soviet Union, there have been some concept plans to use atomic-powered submarine oil tankers to exploit Arctic oilfields in Alaska and Siberia. General Dynamics had apparently approached German shipbuilders during the early-1980s about the possible construction of either a US$725 million nuclear-powered or a US$700 million methane-powered version of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) submarine tanker to carry LNG from the Arctic to North America and Europe.Submarine Tanker Plans - New York Times, 19 November 1981 This was an expansion of an earlier United States Merchant Marine Academy in a 1974 scholar project by Patrick Moloney. Other uses Another (albeit black market) type of \\"trade\\" usage is the known use of narco submarines or \\"drug subs\\" by drug smugglers. In one case, a Colombian drug cartel was interrupted before finishing the construction of a professional-grade, 30 m long, 200 ton carrying-capacity submarine apparently intended for the cocaine trade with the US. At the time of the police raid, the submarine was being constructed in segmented parts in a warehouse high in the Andes near Bogot√°.Submarine found in Colombian Andes - CNN, 7 September 2000 However, most drug subs so far are not as sophisticated as professional merchant submarines would be, being mainly intended to run just under the surface, rather than deeply submerged.

Post Campus(reported then at ). Walt Whitman was born near the site of Jayne's Hill, and visited the summit. In 1881, Whitman wrote: \\"I write this back again at West Hills on a high elevation (the highest spot on Long Island?) Of Jayne's Hill. . . . A view of thirty of forty, or even fifty or more miles, especially to the east and south and southwest: the Atlantic Ocean to the latter points in the distance - a glimpse or so of Long Island Sound to the north.\\" In 1887, it was reported to be in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, only one foot shy of the reported height of Harbor Hill.

In more recent times, in 1980, a plan to place a radio tower on top of Jayne's Hill as one of a series of police radio towers was foiled when environmentalists and residents physically blocked county bulldozers. Regardless, a water tower was erected in 1998. This in combination with forest growth overtaking the grasslands once present on the hill severely restrict the views once beheld by Whitman. Present day As part of West Hills County Park, the summit is located on public land and lies along the white-blazed Walt Whitman trail. The closest parking is at the end of Reservoir Road, West Hills, NY near the private grounds of a county water tower. The park is open until dusk. Passing through two series of metal gates, one may reach the summit within a matter of minutes along the trail, with very little elevation to tackle along the way. The summit is marked by a boulder bearing a plaque inscribed with Walt Whitman's poem \\"Paumanok\\" from Leaves of Grass. Unfortunately as of 2010, some vandalization has occurred at the area, as previously existing wooden fences and signage are missing, as well as the boulder itself being marked with spray paint. If proceeding further than Jayne's Hill along the trail system, one should take caution as there are a few missing blazes, as well as several bridle paths in current use by horses which intersect the hiking trails.

It was broadcast under the ITV Play branding on ITV a few nights a week from around midnight (usually), and from 1.00am on ITV2. The show launched on 19 February 2007. Both Glitterball and Make Your Play alternated their days of broadcast. Glitterball's final show broadcast on the morning of Sunday 30 September 2007.  Overview  Glitterball was created by Ludus:ETVETV official site (who also produced The Mint) and produced from studios at 3SixtyMedia, Manchester. The programme was broadcast on ITV and ITV2 from Sunday to Wednesdays. The show started on 19 February 2007. In order to win money, holidays and various other special prizes, viewers are required to either call in at a cost of 75p from a BT landline, text the word 'BALL' to an automated call back service or enter via the ITV website. If successful, they would be placed on hold and then transferred live to the studio to deliver their answer. An announcement on 12 September 2007 confirmed that the show, along with similar late night phone-ins, would be phased out by the end of 2007. The Starlight Theatre Similar to The Mint, presenters refer the studio set as \\"The Starlight Theatre\\" and if a caller wins, they are transferred to \\"The Box Office\\" to claim the cash prize. The Starlight Theatre was originally an attraction at the now-defunct Granada Studios Tour in Manchester, and is now a production space as part of 3sixtymedia, the facilities company co-owned by ITV and BBC Resources. The studio was also used to produce sister programme Make Your Play.  Presenters  *K√©ll√© Bryan *Zoe Hardman *Alex Kramer - formerly a presenter on Make Your Play and Quiz Call. *Katy Pullinger *Craig Stevens - formerly a presenter of The Mint. Like The Mint, Glitterball was presented by two presenters at a time. Later on in the show, the presenters' screen times were split up. Guest Presenters *Yolly Koppel *Charlie McArdle *Russ Spencer Games Most of the Glitterball's games were shown on a big screen in the studio, rather than on the viewers television screen at home. Glitterword This game started off with a long word, called the \\"Glitterword\\". The viewers had to then make a three or more letter word from the letters in the \\"Glitterword\\". For example the word for the first show was \\"Thrilling\\", so the word \\"ring\\" can be made. There were a total of eleven possible winning answers per game, ten which could win callers normally ¬£500 or ¬£1,000 (but can vary), and one word called the \\"Glitterword\\" which, if guessed, potentially won the callers either thousands of pounds, or free holidays. if the \\"Glitterword\\" was guessed, the game ended. Picture Perfect The viewers were shown pictures of five celebrities which were numbered from one to five, and the callers had to sort them out in order of youngest to oldest and just say the numbers. Crossword This was a 3D crossword setup in the studio, and a copy was also shown on the big studio screen. Callers had to guess the words in the crossword, answers were all based on a theme. To make the answer appear on the 3D crossword, the presenter had to flip each letter over. A \\"Winner Board\\" was also on the screen on the studio, to show who had won, and their winnings. Spellcheque The game had six lines of letters in total. Callers were given two letters on the top line, they then had to add another given letter to this first line, to create a three letter word. They were then given another letter to add to the previous line, to create a four letter word, and so on, until a seven letter word was made. Example (from 1st show): Start Word: AT Clue: E - TEA Clue: S - EAST Clue: D - DATES Clue: L - TALES Clue: E - SEDATE Clue: They will then reveal another clue letter here to make a new word.

Morse (May 5, 1841 ‚Äì August 31, 1920) was an American Civil War soldier who received the Medal of Honor for his actions during The Battle of the Wilderness in that war. Biography Born in Marseille, France, Morse was a sergeant in Company \\"I\\" of the 62nd New York State Volunteers (Anderson Zouaves) and was awarded his Medal of Honor on January 14, 1890, for gallantry at the Battle of the Wilderness, Virginia, on May 5, 1864. Morse enlisted as a private in the Union Army on June 24, 1861 at New York City, and was mustered into Company \\"I\\" of the Anderson Zouaves Infantry Regiment (later the 62nd N. Y. S. V.) on June 30, 1861. He was promoted to corporal around the time that the regiment left New York for Washington on August 21, 1861 and was promoted sergeant on September 20. Morse died at the age of 79 on August 31, 1920 in Bath, New York and he is buried at Bath National Cemetery. His grave can be found in section J, Row 24, Grave 4. The Battle of the Wilderness At the battle of Fair Oaks, May 31, 1862, Morse was wounded in the hand. On May 4, 1863 he was taken prisoner at the battle of Salem Church. He was exchanged and at the time of the Battle of the Wilderness, May 5, 1864, was in command of his company, which numbered only 15, there being no commissioned officers left. On the day of the Battle of the Wilderness, Sgt. Morse, together with his company, held a position on the left center of the regiment next to the color guard. The action took place on the Orange Plank Road, west of its intersection with Brock Road, the 62nd regiment had been ordered to advance and charge the enemy. The enemy was forced back to its first line of defense and being given no time to rally was forced back to its second line. Here it made a stand and, by desperate fighting, prevented the 62nd New York's further advance. The Confederates, now occupying a strong position, laid down a destructive fire on the 62nd. The regiment being pressed very hard was ordered to fall back on rifle pits. Despite falling back in perfect order the movement was interpreted by the enemy as a full retreat and started in pursuit. Despite the pursuit the regiment maintained its order continually loading and facing about to fire while it fell back. The line had marched about 50 feet when it was about faced to fire a volley into the advancing enemy. It was at this time that it was noticed that John H. L. Gilmore, one of the regiment's color- sergeants had fallen mortally wounded with the colours. Gilmore had been struck by a ball and had fallen his body covering the flag. It is reported that someone in the regiment shouted \\"The colors are down!\\" and Morse and Corporal Michael Ditzel of company \\"F\\" ran out from the line towards the wounded Gilmore and the advancing enemy. Morse was the first to arrive at the almost lifeless color-sergeant's side. Taking up the flag, Morse turned to make for his own line, however, an enemy officer, who had been making for the same position shot Morse in the knee with his revolver. Despite this both Morse and Ditzel made it back to their own lines where Morse remained with the regiment still bearing the flag until it was relieved. Coincidentally May 5, the date the battle of the Wilderness took place, happened to be Morse's birthday. Private James R. Evans of Company \\"H\\" of the same regiment also received the Medal of Honor for his actions on the same day to rescue the regimental flag. Battle Flags of the Anderson Zouaves A Federal battle flag, a gift of Major Robert Anderson and made by Tiffany & Co., was presented to the regiment by Major Samuel Wylie Crawford on August 14, 1861, at Rikers Island, New York. A Regimental battle flag, a gift of the Council of New York and made by the firm of George Brandon & John Styles was presented to the regiment by Brig. Gen. John J. Peck on May 8, 1862 on the Williamsburg battlefield. Medal of Honor citation Rank and Organization: :Sergeant, Company I, 62d New York Infantry. Place and date: At Wilderness, Va., May 5, 1864.

The album is part of the (UK) Now! series, and is a collaboration with Smash Hits magazine, a successful pop music based magazine at the time. It was conceived, written and designed by the Smash Hits staff, and the liner notes are written in the magazine's offbeat style. The album features popular UK Singles Chart hits from 1980 to 1987, in rough backwards chronological order, starting with more recent songs (four songs for each year) and ending with older ones. Many of the older songs had not featured on any Now albums before as the series did not start until 1983. A companion issue of the magazine was released at the same time, featuring pictures and lyrics to all of the songs on the album. The front cover of the vinyl and audio cassette releases feature the words 32 Swingorilliant Hits of the 80's. For the Compact Disc release the number was changed to 31, as Michael Jackson's \\"One Day in Your Life\\" is missing from the CD version. A VHS tape was also released featuring 26 music videos of songs from the compilation. Neil Tennant, who features on side 1 of the album as part of Pet Shop Boys, worked as Assistant Editor of Smash Hits magazine in the early 1980s. Smash Hits went on to release their own various artists compilation albums. This is the first album in the (UK) Now! series to be themed 1980s.

History Established in 1883 under the reign of King David KalƒÅkaua, the school was first built directly above Kealia River and then moved up the hill to where it currently stands on Mailihuna Hill. In 1938, the school was officially declared a Junior High School and graduated its first 66 twelfth- grade students in 1946. In 1997, the school was split due to the growing population. In addition to the expansion of the Kapa ªa schools such as Kapa ªa Elementary School, supporting K through 5th grade, Kapa ªa Middle School was newly created only a few miles away and was planned for grades 6, 7, and 8th. Kapaa High School and Intermediate had been serving grades 7 through 12. With the break off, the school became only 9th through 12th grade and renamed simply Kapa ªa High School. In 2004, Kapa ªa High School decided, given the success of Kapa ªa Middle School's uniform dress code, that it would also implement its own uniforms. A line of green and white shirts, jackets and sweaters were designed to help create unity and safety at the school. Campus The campus has the stainless steel sculpture Hukilau by Wayne Zebzda and the mixed media sculpture Seven Pillars of Wisdom by Carol Kouchi Yotsuda. Mascots and School Pride Kapa ªa High School is home to one of the original Warriors mascots in Hawaii. The school sported the colors of green and white, which is reflected in the campus buildings, art, uniforms, and banners. Very much like in the University of Hawai ªi at MƒÅnoa, the terms \\"Warrior Pride\\" and \\"We Believe in Our Warriors\\" have been some of the common catch phrases. On top of the school mascots each class picks its own mascot to represent their particular incoming year. For example, the mascot for the class of 2002 was the seal, class of 2003 was the dragon, 2004 was the \\"honu\\" or turtle, 2005 was the tiger, 2006 was the turtle, and 2007 was the \\"mo ªo\\" or gecko . These mascots were often the main symbols in the class banners for assemblies and class competitions.

It is situated in Auckland, New Zealand, and it also has strong links to the Anglican church; the Anglican Bishop of Auckland and the Dean of Auckland are permanent members of the school's Board Of Governors. The school sits on the former site of King's College and was established there on 6 June 1922 when the College moved to its current site in the South Auckland region of Otahuhu.King's School - Our History Boys at King's School are offered a variety of curriculum activities. These include numeracy, literacy, Christian education, physical education, science, technology, art, music, drama, band and French. History The school opened on June 6, 1922 with 164 boys, after the King‚Äôs College Secondary Department moved to Middlemore. The King's College headmaster, Colonel Charles Thomas Major, passed the site in Remuera to the newly formed King‚Äôs School Board of Governors, and continued to play an active role at the school. 1922-1930 The first Chairman of the Board of Governors was Professor H S Dettman and the first Headmaster was A Clifton-Smith, who arrived from The Hutchins School. In 1927 Lt-Col T H Dawson, took over as Board Chairman and J G T Castle succeeded Clifton-Smith as Headmaster. The original stables were converted into a school chapel dedicated in 1928 by A W Averill, Archbishop of New Zealand and officially named The Chapel of the Holy Child. 1931-1940 In 1931 J M Beaufort was appointed Headmaster and the school roll had dropped to 141 with 34 boarders. 1934 saw Colonel Charles Major take control of the school,after the resignation of Beaufort, pending the arrival of his son-in-law, John Morris in 1936. During these difficult times the school was run in conjunction with King's College. Bishop Averill was appointed as Chairman of the Board of Governors in 1935. In 1936 Colonel Major took over the Chairman position, the new Hanna Block was built and John Morris became headmaster. In 1938 S J Hanna became Chairman of the Board of Governors. Charles Major died in London in November. 1941-1960 During the war years the school roll continued to rise reaching 260 with 76 boarders in 1943. The same year saw the return of the Headmaster from war service. In 1949 a new, enlarged swimming pool was opened and the school roll was now at 275 including 87 boarders. The construction of the War Memorial Hall commenced in 1954 and was completed in 1955, dedicated by the Bishop of Auckland, Bishop Simkin. In 1959 the roll was at 317 with 104 boarders. 1961-1980 In 1961 Dr D L Richwhite began his 13-year term as Chairman of the Board of Governors. The following year saw the creation of 'The Friends of King‚Äôs School', originally called 'The King‚Äôs School Association'. The resignation of John Morris as Headmaster after 30 years service and the appointment of R J Pengelly as his successor occurred in 1965. In 1967 the first major development appeal was launched to fund the construction of the Kerridge Block. In 1974 Dr D L Richwhite retired as Board Chairman. The new 25-metre swimming pool was also completed and dedicated. The first year of weekly boarding was 1979. 1981-1990 The King‚Äôs School Foundation was formed in 1984. In 1986 a Friends‚Äô Gala Day raised $66,000 towards the construction of the pavilion to be later known as the Arthur Lennan Pavilion situated above No. 2 Field. Pengelly retired after 22 years as Headmaster in 1987 and was replaced by B M Butler the long-standing Headmaster of Huntley School. The Greening of King‚Äôs Appeal launched to fund the construction of an Astro Turf playing field on the site of the No 1 field. The school roll was now 575. Pengelly was dismissed in 1987. 1991-Present 1992 was the last year of boarding. The boarding house closed and the two remaining dormitories on the top floor of the Hanna Block were converted into classrooms. In 1993 further extensions to the Chapel included a new south annex with the nave being extended and the addition of a choir changing room. The dedication of the new extensions was performed by Old Boy, Bishop Bruce Gilberd on 13 June. The new technology centre was opened in 1994 occupying the area of the former assembly hall/gymnasium. 1997 was the 75th anniversary of the opening of the school, and the JR Fletcher Performing Arts Centre was dedicated by the Bishop of Auckland and Board Member, John Paterson. The King‚Äôs School Old Boys‚Äô Association was launched with Simon Moore the Inaugural President. As the school moved into the 21st century Bret Butler retired after 12 years as Headmaster. At the commencement of Term 2 Neil McWhannell took over as Headmaster. The Aquadome was officially opened by Sir Edmund Hillary on Friday 20 July 2001. At the end of the year Neil McWhannell retired and returned to Australia. In 2002 Harvey Rees-Thomas was appointed headmaster for a year to allow the Board of Governors to carry out a search for the new headmaster. Tony Sissons took over as the 10th Headmaster of King‚Äôs School in 2003. Construction of the Light House Project was started at the beginning of 2006 and was officially opened in August 2007. Work began on the Sportsdome in February 2008 and was completed in Term 3 2008. A new project called the Centennial Building will replace the old Hanna block.

While Coote was the fourth transplant recipient in Australia, she is only the second to survive for a significant period. Personal life Born on 3 January 1970 and growing up on a family farm, Galen, from Manilla in northern New South Wales, Coote attended a private Catholic school near Tamworth. She married in 1996. Heart transplant The procedure was performed by the Chinese-Australian cardiothoracic surgeon Dr Victor Chang. The urgency was due to complications of viral-induced tonsilitis, that dramatically weakened her heart. The surgery was performed at St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney. When she later began rejecting the first heart, Coote was forced to endure a second transplant, which took place in 1986. She has enjoyed good health since.Fiona Coote defies transplant odds Post transplant Much of Coote's life has been spent in the public eye and she has worked for numerous charitable organisations including the Victor Chang Foundation and the Starlight Foundation. In 1999, Coote was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in recognition of her public awareness promotion of heart disease, and for her work raising funds for seriously and terminally ill children. Coote has also worked in promotions for Willow Valley, a cereal manufacturer, and Dairy Farmers. As a result of her fame, Coote was approached to appear in the Australian soap Neighbours. Despite beginning rehearsals, Coote ultimately decided acting was not for her. Channel Ten publicly blamed the back down on illness but Coote later attributed it to the associated pressure to participate in interviews and publicity for the show. Coote has made a number of television appearances, including appearing in a segment on Burke's Backyard. In 2001 a rose was named in honour of Coote.

Urartian Kingdom  Tushpa was the capital of the Urartian kingdom in the 9th century BC. The early settlement was centered upon the steep-sided bluff now referred to as Van Fortress (Van Kalesi), not far from the shores of Lake Van and a few kilometers west of the modern city of Van. The fortress of Van is a massive stone fortification built by the ancient kingdom of Urartu and held from the 9th to 7th centuries BC. It overlooks Tushpa, and is the largest example of this kind of complex. A number of similar fortifications were built throughout the Urartian kingdom, usually cut into hillsides and outcrops in places where modern-day Armenia, Turkey and Iran meet. Successive groups such as the Armenians, Romans, Medes, Achaemenid and Sassanid Persians, Arabs, Seljuqs, Ottomans and Russians each controlled the fortress at one time or another. The lower parts of the walls of Van Citadel were constructed of unmortared basalt, while the rest was built from mud-bricks. Such fortresses were used for regional control, rather than as a defense against foreign armies. The ancient ruins of the fortress support walls constructed during the medieval era. Other cuneiform inscriptions have been found at the site and are typically off limits unless to large tour groups due to vandalism.The Seventy Wonders of the Ancient World In the trilingual Behistun inscription, carved in the order of Darius the Great of Persia, the country referred to as Urartu in Babylonian is called Armenia in Old Persian.  Orontid Dynasty of Armenia and Persian Empire  The region came under the control of the Orontid dynasty of Armenia in the 7th century BC and later Persians in the mid-6th century BC. Inscription of Xerxes the Great near the Van Citadel A stereotyped trilingual inscription of Xerxes the Great of the 5th century BC is inscribed upon a smoothed section of the rock face, some above the ground near the fortress of Van. The niche was originally carved out by Xerxes' father King Darius in the 6th‚Äì5th century, but left the surface blank. The inscription is written in 27 lines in Old Persian, Babylonian, and Elamite. The inscription reads: When it was published by Eug√®ne Burnouf in 1836,Burnouf, M√©moire sur deux inscriptions cun√©iformes trouv√©es pr√®s d'Hamadan et qui font partie des papiers du Dr Schulz, Paris, 1836; Schulz, an orientalist from Hesse, had been sent out by the French foreign ministry to copy inscriptions but had been murdered in 1829; see Arthur John Booth, The Discovery and Decipherment of the Trilingual Cuneiform Inscriptions 1902, esp. pp 95ff, 206. through his realization that it included a list of the satrapies of Darius (repeated by Xerxes in nearly identical language), he was able to identify and publish an alphabet of thirty letters, most of which he had correctly deciphered. Burnouf's reading of the Van trilingual inscription had made a significant contribution to the deciphering of Old Persian cuneiform.Another photograph of the inscription.  Alexander the Great, the Seleucid Empire and the Kingdom of Armenia  In 331 BC, Tushpa was conquered by Alexander the Great and after his death became part of the Seleucid Empire. By the early 2nd century BC it was part of the Kingdom of Armenia. It became an important center during the reign of the Artaxiad Armenian king, Tigranes II, who founded the city of Tigranakert in the 1st century BC.The Journal of Roman Studies ‚Äì Page 124 by Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies This region was ruled by the Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia before the 4th century AD. In the History of Armenia attributed to Moses of Chorene, the city is called Tosp, from Urartian Tushpa.  Byzantine Empire and Kingdom of Vaspurakan  The Byzantine Empire briefly held the region from 628 to 640, after which it was invaded by the Muslim Arabs, who consolidated their conquests as the province of Ermeniye. Decline in Arab power eventually allowed local Armenian rulers to re-emerge, with the Artsruni dynasty soon becoming the most powerful. Initially dependent on the rulers of the Kingdom of Ani, they declared their independence in 908, founding the kingdom of Vaspurakan. The kingdom had no specific capital: the court would move as the king transferred his residence from place to place, such as Van city, Vostan, Aghtamar, etc. In 1021 the last king of Vaspurakan, John- Senekerim Artsruni, ceded his entire kingdom to the Byzantine empire, who established the Vaspurakan theme on the former Artsruni territories.  Seljuq Empire  Incursions by the Seljuq Turks into Vaspurakan started in the 1050s. After their victory in 1071 at the battle of Manzikert the entire region fell under their control. After them, local Muslim rulers emerged, such as the Ahlatshahs and the Ayyubids (1207). For a 20-year period, Van was held by the Anatolian Seljuq Sultanate until the 1240s when it was conquered by the Mongols. In the 14th century, Van was held by the Kara Koyunlu, and later by the Timurids.  Ottoman Empire  The first half of the 15th century saw the Van region become a land of conflict as it was disputed by the Ottoman Empire and the Persian Safavid Empire. The Safavids captured Van in 1502. The Ottomans took the city in 1515 and held it for a short period. The Safavids took it again in 1520 and the Ottomans gained final and definite control of the city in 1548. They first made Van into a sanjak dependent on the Erzurum eyalet, and later into a separate Van eyalet in about 1570. Towards the second half of the 19th century Van began to play an increased role in the politics of the Ottoman Empire due to its location near the borders of the Persian, Russian and Ottoman Empire, as well as its proximity to Mosul.

Career Irgens- Jensen studied piano with Nils Larsen while a philology student at the University of Oslo. Irgens-Jensen undertook all of his musical studies, apart from the piano lessons, on his own and he never had a teacher in composition. As time passed, thorough studies of musical scores and topics in music theory took much his time. He also had short periods of study in Germany, Denmark and France. Irgens-Jensen debuted as a composer in 1920 with a number of vocal pieces that generated considerable interest and were generally viewed by listeners and domestic critics of the era as being quite radical. Throughout Irgens-Jensen's career, vocal music would constitute a vital part of his production. One of the most widely recognized works is the song Altar, written to a poem by Halldis Moren Vesaas. Irgens-Jensen wrote the oratorio Heimferd, a \\"dramatic symphony\\" for solo choir and orchestra, for the 1930 900th anniversary celebration in commemoration of the death of the king Saint Olav which led to the Christianization of Norway. Irgens-Jensen was bestowed with a first prize in a 1930 national composition competition held in commemoration of Saint Olav's death. Heimferd, which features texts by novelist Olav Gullv√•g, generated considerable public attention upon its premiere and was performed twelve times in the ensuing months in order to meet the public's demand. Heimferd is widely regarded as a national Norwegian monument both in terms of its content and musical material, and represents a major work within the Norwegian oratorical tradition. Other key Irgens-Jensen vocal works includes Der Gott und die Bajadere (Text: Goethe), a cantata from 1932, and Japanischer Fr√ºhling (Japanese Spring, with Japanese poetry), a vocal cycle composed in 1957. From an early stage in his compositional career, Irgens- Jensen would also focus on larger instrumental works. Tema con variazioni (1925/34) and Passacaglia (1927) are works that represent Irgens-Jensen's orchestral production and are widely regarded as essential works in the Norwegian literature for orchestra. A few of Irgens-Jensen's works from this era feature national traits, one of which is his orchestral suite Partita sinfonica (1939) which is based on the composer's stage music for Hans E. Kinck's drama Driftekaren (The Drover). World War II left a clear and indelible mark on Irgens-Jensen's compositional output, and he wrote a number of songs and choral works with patriotic texts - works that due to the occupying Nazi forces censorship would be distributed anonymously and illegally. The war years also saw Irgens-Jensen composing his Symphony in D minor, which won first prize at a secret competition held in 1943, marking the 25th anniversary of the Norwegian Society of Composers.

She was laid down 30 April 1943 by Brown Shipbuilding Co., Houston, Texas and launched on 15 July 1943. The ship was commissioned on 29 October 1943 manned by a Coast Guard crew under the command of Lieutenant Commander Oscar C. Rohnke, USCG. On 18 November 1943, she was underway for Bermuda, British West Indies, for her shakedown cruise. Commencing Thanksgiving Day of 1943, the ship was subjected to a rigorous training schedule including gunnery practice, submarine warfare tactics, maneuvering, and the hundreds of other tasks demanded of a man-o-war. On 23 December 1943 she departed for the U.S. Navy Yard in Charleston, South Carolina for post-shakedown repairs.  World War II North Atlantic operations  On Christmas Day, Savage completed her training and ship and crew reported to Norfolk, Virginia as members of the Atlantic Fleet. In January 1944 the ship was assigned as one of six vessels composing Escort Division 23 of Task Force 63. This task force was engaged in escorting convoys of 60 to 80 merchant ships from United States ports to the Mediterranean Theatre. During the operations, lasting approximately seven weeks for each convoy, Savage and her sister ships safely escorted hundreds of ships loaded with vital war materials safely past the heavy enemy submarine and air concentrations in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. On 1 April 1944, Convoy UGS 36, whose escort included USS Savage, was attacked by thirty enemy aircraft north of Algiers, Algeria. So intense was the gunfire of the escorting ships that the attack was repelled without a single allied vessel lost. Her only casualty during the action was a member of the depth charge crew who was struck in the ankle by shell fragments. During the latter half of 1944 and the first six months of 1945, USS Savage escorted high-speed troop convoys between New York and the British Isles to support the final assault on Nazi Germany. During eighteen crossings of the Atlantic, Savage and her sister ships safely brought through over 1,000 loaded troop and supply ships without a single loss despite the persistent threat of enemy vessels and treacherous weather conditions. Following the defeat of Nazi Germany, Savage sailed to the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where she was fitted with more anti-aircraft guns. She then sailed on 30 May 1945 for an intensive period of operational and gunnery training in the Caribbean off Culebra, Puerto Rico.  Transferred to the Pacific theater  After transiting the Panama Canal on 18 June 1945, she proceeded from San Francisco to the Aleutian Islands and arrived at Adak on 8 July 1945. The ship and her crew reported to the Commander of North Pacific Fleets for escort duty.  End-of-war activity  After the hostilities in the Pacific ended, Savage escorted two convoys from Cold Bay, Alaska to Russian waters where the American escort ships were dismissed. One convoy departed Cold Harbor on 23 July 1945 and the other on 25 August 1945. During the interim, she escorted oilers to refuel Task Force 92, which had been bombarding shore installations in the Kuril Islands of Russia; then occupied by Japanese forces. On 27 September 1945 Savage departed Attu for Petropavlovsk, USSR, and arrived there on the morning of 2 October 1945. She delivered supplies and mail to then departed for Attu. At the end of hostilities with Japan, Savage was assigned liaison duty in the Far East. She shuttled between Okinawa, and Tsingtao, China from December 1945 until February 1946 when she sailed for Pearl Harbor. In April 1946, she sailed for Green Cove Springs, Florida. She was decommissioned there on 13 June 1946; with her CO Captain John M. Waters, USCG in attendance. Also decommissioned at this location on June 1946 were the other five Coast Guard manned ships comprising CortDiv23. , , , and . With the exception of Richey, all were recommissioned as Navy manned destroyer escort radar picket ships.  Conversion to radar picket ship  After World War II most, if not all, early warning networks had been dismantled. At the height of the Cold War, paranoia ran deep within the halls of the United States military establishment. By 1949, the USSR had developed the atomic bomb and the capacity to deliver it by air. The United States considered that it needed to protect itself from the Soviets, formerly allies. To this end, the US constructed early-warning stations. This system was called the Distant Early Warning system or the DEW Line, which was a state of the art product. There were 22 stations and the line spanned approximately . The DEW Line's radar stations could chart the path of the Soviet bombers toward the North American continent. It was hailed as \\"a bulwark\\" against the forces of communism. Radar picket escort destroyers were employed to detect these aircraft moving toward North America on a polar route. Savage was redesignated a radar picket escort destroyer (DER-386) on 3 September 1954 and recommissioned on 18 February 1955 in Boston, Massachusetts; with Lt. Cmdr. R. E. Davis, USN as commanding officer. Distinguished guests included Walter S. Savage, Sr., father of Walter S. Savage, Jr., USNR, and Captain Oscar C. Rohnke, USCG. In July 1955, she was transferred to the Pacific Fleet with her home port being Seattle, Washington. She arrived in Seattle on 6 August 1955. Savage served in this capacity until December 1958, when her home port was changed to Pearl Harbor. She operated as a radar picket ship of the mid-Pacific barrier from 12 January 1959 until March 1960. She then served as a search and rescue navigation aid ship until May 1965.  Vietnam operations  On 17 May 1965, Savage sailed for South Vietnam where she spent more time on station in Operation Market Time than any other DER. She guarded against sea infiltration by North Vietnamese and assisted land forces by providing naval gunfire support. She had no periods out of Vietnam service until October when she made a five-day visit to Hong Kong. From October 1965 through October 1968 the ship made five more tours off Vietnam on Operation Market Time, operating offshore, searching junks and small fishing boats for Viet Cong weapons and infrequently providing naval gunfire support with her two guns from 1 to 15 January,12 June to 16 September 1966, 24 August to 8 September 1967, 16 September to 12 October and 2 to 18 December 1968. She made Taiwan Strait patrols in June, September, and December 1967; and in July and October 1968. During her 1967 and 1968 Market Time patrols, she also served as \\"mother ship\\" to 5 ‚Äì 6 U.S. Navy PCF's (swift boats). All of Savages officers (except for the Executive Officer and Commanding Officer) functioned as additional officers to the two crews per Swift Boat (daytime and nighttime) covering the Mekong River Delta and the Mekong River in the \\"brown water navy\\". On 1 February 1969 she arrived back in Pearl Harbor and entered the naval shipyard for restricted availability and upkeep. On 7 July 1969 she departed for San Francisco and deactivation at Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, California. On 17 October 1969, she was decommissioned for the last time and joined the inactive reserve fleet.  Post-war decommissioning  Explosion of an AGM-88A HARM missile on Savage in 1982 She was stricken on 1 June 1975 and sunk as a target off California on 25 October 1982.  Awards  USS Savage earned one battle star in World War II (Convoy UGS 36, 1 April 1944). She also earned the American Campaign Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, the World War II Victory Medal, the Navy Occupation Service Medal, the China Service Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, and the Vietnam Service Medal with six battle stars for her service in Vietnam.

It first appeared in the October 1970 issue of Think, the IBM house magazine, and was reprinted in Asimov's 1975 collection Buy Jupiter and Other Stories. Early in 1970 the author was commissioned by Think to write a story based on a quotation by writer and social commentator J. B. Priestley: Asimov, assuming that Think wanted a story that illustrated Priestley's quotation, crafted 2430 A.D. He selected the date because he calculated that at the then- current rate of human population growth, doubling every thirty-five years, that would be the year when the world's animal biomass would consist entirely of human beings. Asimov wrote the story on April 26, 1970, but it was rejected as Think had actually wanted a story that refuted the quotation. (\\"Well, they never said so,\\" Asimov remarked later.) After Asimov wrote a second story that did refute the quotation, Think took the first story after all and published it in their October 1970 issue. The second story was later published in Analog magazine as \\"The Greatest Asset\\". Both stories inspired by the Priestley quote were included in the 1975 collection Buy Jupiter and Other Stories. Plot summary Earth has established a totally balanced and ecologically stable underground society (similar to that portrayed in Asimov's novel The Caves of Steel). But one man, Cranwitz, regarded as a deviant and eccentric because he keeps a few animals as pets, refuses to get rid of these animals, the last non-human inhabitants of the planet. He is finally persuaded by his sector representatives to exterminate his pets, but also commits suicide. This leaves Earth in 'perfection', with its fifteen trillion inhabitants, twenty billion tons of human brain and the 'exquisite nothingness of uniformity'. References *Asimov, Isaac (1975).

It was originally a water park. History The park was originally built and developed in 1982 by Herschend Family Entertainment Corporation as \\"White Water\\" in the Grand Prairie Entertainment district, along with Lion Country Safari and the Palace of Wax. The site was purchased and closed by Wet 'n Wild Inc. at the end of 1985 to reduce competition at their park away in nearby Arlington, Texas. The closure was condemned by the city council who were granted a restraining order preventing dismantling of the park. The council dropped their attempt to gain control of the park after a task force determined that it would be too expensive. The park was redeveloped in 1991 and 1992 as Boardwalk Fun Park. The new owners used much of the old infrastructure and rides in the new park. The park suffered delays in construction and ride certifications, and it opened in July 1992. In September 1992, an accident on the park's roller coaster, the Pipeline Express, threw a 12-year-old girl approximately into an unused pool beneath the ride causing her to slip into a coma and suffer brain trauma. The coaster was closed following the accident. The victims parents sued the park for negligence and deceptive trade practices. The park aimed at reopening for the 1993 season, which did not occur. After sitting closed for several years, in 1996 the park's land was purchased by Automotive Investment Group and the infrastructure and rides were removed in April 1997. The Grand Prairie Ford car dealership was constructed on the site in 1999.

Picard played in the National Hockey League with the Hartford Whalers, San Jose Sharks, Ottawa Senators, St. Louis Blues, Edmonton Oilers, and Philadelphia Flyers. , he serves as an amateur scout for the Blues. Playing career As a youth, Picard played in the 1981 and 1982 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournaments with a minor ice hockey team from Beauport, Quebec City. Picard began his career playing for Trois-Rivi√®res Draveurs in the QMJHL, where he established himself as a scoring force who was also tough and hard hitting. His final year there he scored 140 points in 66 games. Picard was drafted by the Whalers in the 9th round, 178th overall, in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft. He met with great success in the minor leagues, leading the American Hockey League with a franchise-record 56 goals for the Springfield Indians in 1991, while leading the team to its final Calder Cup championship. However, Picard would never translate his earlier success to the NHL. He never played a full season in the NHL and only played in at least half of the games in a season once, during the 1999 season. That season he also played in five playoff games, the only time he played in the NHL playoffs. For the 2002 season Picard played in the Deutsche Eishockey Liga in Germany for the Adler Mannheim. He then played for two years with the Grand Rapids Griffins (a team for which he played parts of six seasons in all, and is the career leader in goals, assists and points) in the AHL before joining Thetford Mines Prolab of the Ligue Nord-Am√©ricaine de Hockey in 2004. He led the team in scoring in 2005, 2006 and 2007 and was the leading scorer in the LNAH in the 2007 season, retiring after the end of the 2009 season. As of November 2014, Picard is the 16th leading goal scorer in minor league history with 563 , as well as 19th in points with 1256.

To the north the lagoon is connected to the Moraleda Channel, to the south lies the Ofqui Isthmus. To the west and east lie the Taitao Peninsula and the Northern Patagonian Ice Field respectively. The lake was formed by the retreat of the San Rafael Glacier in the Northern Patagonian Ice Field. Today it is a popular tourism destination, and ships sail from Puerto Chacabuco, Puyuhuapi and Puerto Montt to the lagoon nearly every day to see the ice falling from the glacier into the lagoon. Cruises pass by this area. The lake was visited by the Antonio de Vea expedition on December 1675. The expedition entered San Rafael Lake taking note of its windy conditions, the San Rafael Glacier and the swampy shores in the south that make up the Isthmus of Ofqui. Antonio de Vea entered San Rafael Lake through R√≠o T√©mpanos (Spanish for \\"Ice Floe River\\") without mentioning any ice floe but stating that the San Rafael Glacier did not reach far into the lake. This has been interpreted to reflect that the effects of the Little Ice Age were not yet to be seen in the lake the late 17th century. In 1857 Chilean navy officer Francisco Hudson and Francisco Fonck explored the lake seeking a passage that permitted navigation further south without the need to rounding the dangerous Tres Montes Peninsula.

An open-high-low-close chart (also OHLC) is a type of chart typically used to illustrate movements in the price of a financial instrument over time. Each vertical line on the chart shows the price range (the highest and lowest prices) over one unit of time, e.g., one day or one hour. Tick marks project from each side of the line indicating the opening price (e.g., for a daily bar chart this would be the starting price for that day) on the left, and the closing price for that time period on the right. The bars may be shown in different hues depending on whether prices rose or fell in that period. The Japanese candlestick chart and OHLC charts show exactly the same data, i.e., the opening, high, low, and closing prices during a particular time frame.Rockefeller, Barbara (Feb. 6 2014). Technical Analysis for Dummies, 3rd Edition. Wiley Publishing, Inc. Day traders, who by default have to watch the price movements on a chart, prefer to use the Japanese candlesticks, because they show the \\"live action\\" price movements by expanding and contracting the candlestick's body, which is easier to grasp (and trade upon) than the standard OHLC bar. Therefore, for dynamic real-time chart analysis, Japanese candlesticks offer advantages over standard OHLC bars. However, for technical analysis of static charts, such as after- market analysis of historical data, the OHLC bars have very clear advantages over the Japanese candlesticks: the OHLC bars do not require color or fill pattern to show the Open and Close levels, and they do not create confusion in cases when, for example, the Open price is lower than the Close price (a bullish sign), but the Close price for the studied bar is lower than the Close price for the previous bar, i.e. the bar to the left on the same chart (a bearish sign). A simple variant on the OHLC chart is the HLC high-low-close chart that identifies the range of the time unit's price action (high - low) and the end result of the time unit's price action (the close). In technical analysis OHLC charts are often combined with charts of other types such as line charts (showing moving average), column charts (trading volume), and range areas (Bollinger Bands).Open High Low Close (OHLC) Chart, AnyChart JavaScript Chart Documentation References External links  * Video describing the parts of the OHLC chart, determining uptrends/downtrends and reversals.

He conquered Nik≈°iƒá (24 September 1877), Bar (10 January 1878), Ulcinj (20 January 1878), Grmo≈æur (26 January 1878) and Vranjina and Lesendro (30 January 1878). The war ended when the Ottomans signed a truce with the Montenegrins at Edirne on 13 January 1878. The advancement of Russian forces toward the Ottomans forced the Ottomans to sign a peace treaty on 3 March 1878, recognising the independence of Montenegro, as well as Romania and Serbia, and also increased Montenegro's territory from 4,405 km¬≤ to 9,475 km¬≤. Montenegro also gained the towns of Nik≈°iƒá, Kola≈°in, Spu≈æ, Podgorica, ≈Ωabljak, Bar, as well as access to the sea.

Battle of Vuƒçji Do (18 July 1876). The return of Montenegrin refugees to their home village, 1877 Background In October 1874, an influential Ottoman statesman, Jusuf-beg Muƒçin Krnjiƒá, was murdered in Podgorica, which at the time was an Ottoman town near the border with Montenegro. It is believed that he had been killed by a close relative of vojvoda Marko Miljanov, a Montenegrin general who also, most likely, instigated the assassination. As a consequence, the Ottomans launched an action of retaliation against the local population and Montenegrin citizens present at the farmers' market in Podgorica, modern-day capital of Montenegro. It is estimated that 17 unarmed Montenegrins had been killed. This event is known as the \\"Podgorica's slaughter\\" (Podgoriƒçki pokolj). It resulted in bad relations between Montenegro and the Ottoman Empire, which further deteriorated with the outbreak of the uprising in Herzegovina (1875). Montenegro conducted the uprising, providing the rebels with military and financial aid and representing their interests to the Porte. Montenegro requested that part of Herzegovina be handed over to the Montenegrins, but the Porte declined. Because of this, Montenegro declared war on 18 June 1876, immediately followed by its foremost ally, the Principality of Serbia. War In the beginning of the war, when Miljanov arrived at Kuƒçi, at the Ottoman frontier, the Kuƒçi revolted and attacked the Ottomans. The Pasha filled Medun and other small forts, Fundina, Koƒái, Zatrijebaƒç and Orahovo with soldiers. The Piperi and Kuƒçi tribes together attacked Koƒái, killing a small part, while they found Ottomans in tower houses whom they wanted to destroy with wooden cannons. An epic poem about the war tells how Abdi Pasha the Cherkessian with 20,000 soldiers of the sanjak of Scutari was sent by the sultan to attack the Kuƒçi and Piperi. The poem tells how part of the army advanced on Koƒái and then fought in Zatrijebaƒç and Fundina. In the Montenegrin-Ottoman war, the Montenegrin army managed to capture certain areas and settlements along the border, while encountering strong resistance from Albanians in Ulcinj, and a combined Albanian-Ottoman force in the Podgorica-Spu≈æ and Gusinje-Plav regions. As such, Montenegro‚Äôs territorial gains were much smaller. Some Muslims and the Albanian population who lived near the then southern border were expelled from the towns of Podgorica and Spu≈æ. \\"What one sees over the course of the first ten years after Berlin was a gradual process of Montenegrin (Slav) expansion into areas that were still exclusively populated by Albanian-speakers. In many ways, some of these affected communities represented extensions of those in the Malisor√´ as they traded with one another throughout the year and even inter-married. Cetinje, eager to sustain some sense of territorial and cultural continuity, began to monitor these territories more closely, impose customs officials in the villages, and garrison troops along the frontiers. This was possible because, by the late 1880s, Cetinje had received large numbers of migrant Slavs from Austrian- occupied Herzegovina, helping to shift the balance of local power in Cetinje's favor. As more migrants arrived, what had been a quiet boundary region for the first few years, became the center of colonization and forced expulsion.\\" ; p.254. footnote 38. \\"It must be noted that, throughout the second half of 1878 and the first two months of 1879, the majority of Albanian-speaking residents of Shpuza and Podgoritza, also ceded to Montenegro by Berlin, were resisting en masse. The result of the transfer of Podgoritza (and Antivari on the coast) was a flood of refugees. See, for instance, AQSH E143.D.1054.f.1 for a letter (dated 12 May 1879) to Dervish Pasha, military commander in I≈ükodra, detailing the flight of Muslims and Catholics from Podgoritza.\\" These populations resettled in Shkod√´r city and its environs.

Biography (2008) Early life He was born in 1949 in a poor village in the central Qu·∫£ng Nam Province. Academic career He came to Japan in 1968 on a Japanese government scholarship. He attended Tokyo's Hitotsubashi University to study economics. Hitotsubashi University has a reputation as a leading university in economics. He graduated with a B.A. in Economics in 1973, and earned a M.A. in 1975 in the same institute. In 1993, he obtained a doctorate from Hitotsubashi University (Ph.D. in Economics). He worked at Japan Center for Economic Research(JCER),Japan Center for Economic Research(JCER)JCER Discussion Paper on Asian Trade by Tran Van Tho became an assistant professor, then professor at Obirin University in Tokyo. In 1990 the Japanese government, for the first time, named three foreigners to the Economic Council of Japan, which advises the prime minister. Tho was one of them and he served for nearly 10 years on the council. In 2000, after completing his term, he was appointed professor at the prestigious Waseda University. Activity In 1993 he was invited to be a member of an economic body advising Vietnamese Prime Minister V√µ VƒÉn Ki·ªát. Later he was on a policy research team under Kiet‚Äôs successor Phan VƒÉn Kh·∫£i. It was then that he called for eliminating paperwork and bureaucracy, recruiting state officials on merit, setting up a level playing ground for foreign and domestic investors and for private and state-owned enterprises. He also advised the government to compile a ‚Äúnegative list‚Äù with entrepreneurs allowed to involve in any activity not finding a place in it. He also criticized the indiscriminate award of doctorates which, thus, held little value. Calling for the revocation of a regulation prohibiting Communist Party members from doing business, he said officials should be allowed to open private companies and engage in business. This has since been seriously considered. In 1997 he published a book in Vietnamese, Industrializing Vietnam in the Age of the Asia-Pacific, and again in 2005, East Asian Economic Upheavals and the Road to Industrialization for Vietnam. In 2003 the Japan Bank for International Cooperation invited him to be the head of its ODA project assessment committee for developing infrastructure in northern Vietnam. Tho initiated the founding of the Vietnam Asia-Pacific Economic Center in Vietnam of which he is now chairman. In 2018, at age 69, Professor Tran Van Tho was awarded the Order of Sacred Treasure, Gold Rays with Rosette in recognition of his contributions to the development of economic ties between Japan and Vietnam, deepening the country‚Äôs understanding of Japan. He retains his Vietnamese citizenship.

On February 2, 1967, the ABA was created. One of the charter teams announced that day was an unnamed Kansas City franchise. The Kansas City team was awarded for $35,000 to James B. Trindle. On March 27, 1967, Vince Boryla was named general manager of the Kansas City team. The Kansas City team had ongoing problems finding an arena to host their games in Kansas City. On April 1, 1967 due to an inability to nail down an arena deal in their home city the Kansas City franchise was relocated to Denver and named the Denver Larks. Trindle had ongoing financial problems with the team, leading Boryla to resign and ultimately to the team being sold to J. William Ringsby, the owner of Rocket Truck Lines. Ringsby soon renamed the team the Denver Rockets in homage to his trucking business. The Denver Rockets played in the ABA from 1967 through 1974. In 1974 the team became the Denver Nuggets and played as such through the ABA's final two seasons. With the ABA-NBA merger in 1976 the Denver Nuggets joined the NBA and continue to play in that league to the present day.

It is found throughout South and Central America, including Trinidad, but not Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, or French Guiana.Adams, J.K. (1989) Pteronotus davyi. Mammalian Species 346: 1-5 Specimens of this bat had been found infected with rabies in Trinidad during the height of that's island's vampire-bat transmitted rabies epidemic of the early half of the 20th century, but not in recent times.Greenhall, Arthur M. 1961. Bats in Agriculture. A Ministry of Agriculture Publication. Trinidad and Tobago.  Description = General features  The lesser naked-backed bat (also known as Davy's naked-backed bat,) earns its name from the appearance of its backside. The bat species appears to have a hairless or \\"naked\\" back due to the attachment of its wings on the mid-line of its dorsal surface. The wing membranes give the bat's back its shiny appearance. The lesser-naked backed bat shares this diagnostic feature with just one other species of bat of the same family (Mormoopidae,) named Pteronotus personatus. Pteronotus dayvi is easily distinguishable from other subspecies in the Genus Pteronotus by sparsely distributed hairs on the membranes of its wings. P. dayvi is characterized with very dense pelage that changes colors throughout the seasons. Little sexual dimorphism is observed in this species, except within the most northern populations located in Sonora. Males of this population are observed to be significantly larger than females. The wing aspect ratio of this species is very high in comparison to many Microchiroptera, allowing these bats to fly long distances at fast speeds. The lips of these bats are large, perhaps allowing for focusing of the soundwaves that are emitted from their pharynx during echolocation.  Behavior  Pteronotus davyi are nocturnal, insectivorous bats that tends to roost in communities within its own species. Daytime roosts are seen to be shared between other species within the family Mormoopidae. This species uses echolocation to target prey and navigate in the dark, deciduous forests they reside in.  Mating and reproduction  Pteronotus davyi are known to be seasonally monogamous, and usually mate in the months of January and February. These bats have one offspring per mating season. The birth of the offspring occurs during the rainy season. The rainy season provides a surge in the insect population, which proves to be important for these insectivorous bats, allowing the young to mature at a fast rate.  Locomotion  Due to their high wing-aspect ratio, these bats can fly at quick burst speeds for long distances, although their long wingspan inhibits them from having great agility.FLIGHT SPEEDS OF FOUR SPECIES OF NEOTROPICAL BATS Heidi L. Hopkins, Cornelio S√°nchez-Hern√°ndez, Mar√≠a de Lourdes Romero-Almaraz, L. Michelle Gilley, Gary D. Schnell, Michael L. Kennedy, and Cheri A. Jones 2003 48 (4), 711-714 These bats are also sufficient climbers. It is believed that they climb high to the top of their roost in order to quickly fly away from the entrance and avoid any nearby predators in waiting.Predation of Lesser Naked-backed Bats (Pteronotus davyi) by a Pair of American Kestrels (Falco sparverius) on the Island of Marie- Galante, French West Indies Arnaud Lenoble, Corentin Bochaton, Teddy Bos, Emmanuel Discamps, and Alain Queffelec 2014 48 (1), 78-81 During nighttime foraging for insects, flight usually occurs near the ground.  Predation  Although predation has not been intensely observed in this species, researchers have found that P. davyi has been hunted by American kestrels (Falco sparverius,) a very common North American falcon. These falcons have been seen to hide at the entrance of the bat roosts and dive after the bats as they are exiting the cave.  Ecology and distribution  These bats are found most commonly in moist habitats that sustain a high volume of insects. Nighttime roosts of these animals are most commonly found in warm, dark, moist caves. P. davyi are found as far north as Mexico and as far south as South America and Honduras. They typically prefer low elevations, but some individuals have been observed at elevations as high as 2,000 meters above sea level. There has been no recorded observance of this species in Guyana, Suriname, or French Guiana. Studies of this species have revealed genetic divergence between the Southeastern P. davyi population, and the Pacific and Gulf Coast populations.Molecular phylogeography of Pteronotus davyi (Chiroptera: Mormoopidae) in Mexico Luis M.

It may also be called the Pygmy Bearded Dragon (though the name is shared with other small Pogona species). Range It is native to Queensland in Australia, but can be found in captivity across the world. Description P. henrylawsoni is similar to the larger central bearded dragon (P. vitticeps), but is usually less than 30 cm (12 in) in total length (including tail), with a shorter and more blunt snout. Common names P. henrylawsoni is also commonly called Lawson's dragon, dumpy dragon, pygmy dragon, dwarf bearded dragon, or black soil bearded dragon. Taxonomy A formal description was not published for this dragon until 1985, despite being known to herpetologists. The scientific name for this species was disputed, along with the other taxonomic treatments of Wells and Wellington, but was published again by Harold Cogger (2000) and others as a valid name.Cogger HG. 2000. Reptiles and Amphibians of Australia, Sixth Edition. Sanibel Island, Florida: Ralph Curtis Publishing. cite The name is noted as invalid in some sources, and given as a synonym for Pogona brevis.Witten GJ. 1994. Taxonomy of Pogona (Reptilia: Lacertilia: Agamidae). Memoirs of the Queensland Museum 37 (1): 329-343. In captivity P. henrylawsoni has a life span of six to eight years, and its natural environment is hot, dry and rocky, which must be mimicked in captivity The Rankins dragon requires a minimum of 15 gallons and a hide,as well as multiple places to climb. It is a social species and with supervision can be handled by children, but the dragon does not like to be turned upside down and will struggle when it is. Most specimens outside of Australia in captivity are descendants of dragons illegally exported in the 1980s. It is generally used as a substitute for Pogona vitticeps, the most common species of bearded dragon in captivity. The Rankin's dragon is similar in personality, yet smaller and more manageable where there is a lack of space and resources. The only issue is the small gene pool within captive populations, being unable to be supplemented by wild individuals from Australia. Etymology The specific epithet, henrylawsoni, is in honor of the Australian author, poet, and philosopher Henry Lawson.

The 15-story building, designed by Clinton and Russell in the Renaissance Revival style, was completed in 1904 at the intersection of Wall, Pearl, and Beaver Streets. The Beaver Building is shaped similarly to a flatiron because of its position at an acute angle formed by the junction of Pearl and Beaver Streets. The building's articulation consists of three horizontal sections similar to the components of a column, namely a base, shaft, and capital. The base is faced with stone, the shaft contains alternating bands of buff and tan brick, and the capital contains multicolored terracotta ornamentation depicting geometric shapes. There are carved beavers over the main entrance facing Pearl and Beaver Streets, signifying the building's original name. The superstructure is of steel frame construction. The Beaver Building was constructed between 1903 and 1904 as a speculative development. The building served as the headquarters of the Munson Steamship Line from 1904 until 1921, and the company owned the building from 1919 to 1937. The building was foreclosed upon in 1937, and ownership subsequently passed to several other entities, including the Bowery Savings Bank. The New York Cocoa Exchange was another large tenant, occupying the building between 1931 and 1972. The commercial spaces on ground level, as well as the interior offices, were significantly altered from their original design, with major renovations in 1937 and the mid-1980s. 1 Wall Street Court was converted into a residential condominium building in 2006. It has been a New York City designated landmark since 1996 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.  Site  1 Wall Street Court is in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan. It occupies most of the block bounded by Hanover Street to the west, Pearl Street to the southeast, and Beaver Street to the north, with facades on Pearl and Beaver Streets. The building faces eastward toward the five-pointed intersection of Pearl, Beaver, and Wall Streets. The property measures on Beaver Street, on Pearl Street, on the intersection with Wall Street, and on the west. The plot covers . Including a four-story annex at 80 Beaver Street, it measures on Beaver Street and on Pearl Street. 1 Wall Street Court's narrow lot was a result of the Financial District's street grid, as outlined in the Castello Plan, a street map for the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam. The site was historically part of the estate of pirate William Kidd. Nearby buildings include the Wall and Hanover Building to the north and 20 Exchange Place to the northwest.  Design  1 Wall Street Court was designed by Clinton and Russell in the Renaissance Revival style. It is tall with 15 stories, as well as a partially raised basement. 1 Wall Street Court is one of a few buildings in Lower Manhattan that are shaped like a flatiron, but was largely overlooked in favor of other buildings such as the Flatiron Building at 23rd Street.  Facade  1 Wall Street Court's articulation consists of three horizontal sections similar to the components of a column, namely a base, shaft, and capital. The two principal elevations on Pearl and Beaver Streets are joined by a rounded corner on Wall Street. The windows on each side are arranged into bays, with six bays each on Pearl and Beaver Streets and three on the rounded corner. These bays generally have one window per floor on the first and second stories, and two windows per floor above; on two of the corner bays, there is one window per floor on the first through twelfth stories, and two windows per floor above. The western facade, treated as the rear of the building, is a plain brick wall with windows. There was a fire escape on the Pearl Street side, dating from 1916, but was removed in the early 21st century. The three-story base is faced with ashlar of granite and Indiana limestone. At the main corner, facing the intersection of Beaver, Wall, and Pearl Streets, there is a rounded stoop leading to the building's first story. This door is underneath an entablature with a rounded sign reading \\"\\" Additional entrances were on the building's western end, originally leading to the elevator lobby. The entrance on Pearl Street, which was formerly located under the Third Avenue elevated line, is more simply designed and contains revolving doors under a canopy. The entrance at Beaver Street has a pediment with carvings of beavers framing a cartouche with the words \\"\\". The other windows on the first story are generally double-height windows, indicating the presence of the mezzanine inside. Above the second story are ornamental cartouches over carvings of beaver heads. There are panels between the window groupings on the third story, and a cornice over the third story. The nine-story shaft is composed of alternating bands of buff and tan brick. The windows are surrounded by glazed green terracotta tiles. The three-story capital is ornamented with multicolored glazed terracotta tiles in green, cream, and russet hues. The windows are separated into pairs surrounded by double-story neoclassical outlines. The terracotta was originally sandblasted to reduce the glaze. The top of the building contains a terracotta cornice. The cornice originally contained copper cresting, although that was removed after 1940. The roof has a gravel surface, and contains a skylight and some heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment.  Features  1 Wall Street Court contains a superstructure made entirely of steel. The floor arches and partitions are made of fireproof brick. In the original layout, all woodwork was covered with fireproof materials; the floors of the corridors were made of mosaic and marble, while the office floors were made of cement. 1 Wall Street Court contains four elevators along its western side. An enclosed fire stair with marble treads is on the building's northwest corner. As built, the building also had two boilers that provided steam for three electric generators aggregating . The total amount of interior space is about . The first-story and mezzanine space was intended to be used by banks, while the basement was reserved for restaurants. The basement still serves as its original purpose, but the National Park Service could not determine if a bank ever used the first story and mezzanine. The first floor is about above street level and contains lobbies, commercial space, and elevator access. The main lobby on Pearl Street and the freight lobby on Beaver Street are connected by a corridor with four elevators. The commercial space is accessed by the corner entrance, which contains a wooden vestibule with a revolving door. The elevator lobby contains a barrel-vaulted ceiling, wood-paneled and mirrored walls, and wood-and-metal elevator doors. The mezzanine, a U-shaped space above of the first floor, is reached by a stair on the west side. The second floor was used as office space for its first hundred years. A \\"typical floor\\" would have an elevator landing on the west, a corridor extending east, and offices on either side of the corridor as well as at the narrow corner. The corridors were originally made of mosaic and marble, while the office floors were cement, and there were glass panels along the corridors prior to the building's 1937 renovation. In the original layout, toilets were placed on the second, fourth, and tenth floors. Because of the interior arrangement and small lot size, all of the interior space was directly lit by a window. One magazine said upon the building's completion that 1 Wall Street Court contained possibly \\"a larger window area relative to floor space than in any other office building in the city\\". Further renovations led to the replacement of the floors, walls, and doors. By 2006, the office space was converted to 126 condominium apartments.  History = Construction  Engraving of the Beaver Building published in 1905 During the late 19th century, builders began erecting tall office buildings in New York City, especially in Lower Manhattan, where they were compelled to build tall structures due to a lack of available land. One such project was headed by the Century Realty Company, who hired Clinton & Russell in 1903 to design a speculative development on a narrow lot at Beaver and Pearl Streets. The Remington Construction Company was hired as the contractor. The building was planned to cost $600,000. Work began in June 1903. Ownership of the Beaver Building was transferred the next month to the Beaver and Wall Street Corporation. During construction, some of the workers went on strike, prompting the Remington Construction Company to hire longshoremen for the project. Construction was completed in October 1904. Original floor plans indicate that the first story had a partition between the two commercial spaces to the west and east; only the western space had a mezzanine.  Munson Line use  The Munson Line, a steamship-line company operating from the United States to the Caribbean and South America, took up offices in the Beaver Building in May 1904. The building was sold to the Hoffman family in 1905 for $1.25 million in cash. The New York Times described the transaction as the \\"first cash purchase of a downtown skyscraper reported in several years\\". Frank Munson bought the Beaver Building in July 1919, when the building was estimated to be worth $1.5 million. The Beaver Building was intended as the headquarters of the Munson Line so it was renamed the Beaver- Munson Building. Shortly afterward, the company announced plans for the 25-story Munson Building at 67 Wall Street, across Beaver Street from the Beaver Building. When the Munson Building opened in 1921, it replaced the Beaver Building as the Munson Line's headquarters. The Munson Line retained ownership of the Beaver Building, which continued to be occupied by tenants involved mainly in shipping, produce, and importing and exporting. However, by the 1930s, these tenants had started to move elsewhere, and the Munson Line itself suffered from financial difficulties throughout the 1920s and 1930s. A first mortgage loan of $750,000 was placed on the Beaver Building in 1928.  Cocoa Exchange use  In April 1931, the New York Cocoa Exchange, described at the time as the world's largest cocoa market, moved to the Beaver-Munson Building from its original headquarters at 124 Water Street. By 1937, the Munson Building Corporation had a debt of $831,690, and the Beaver Building was foreclosed upon. The Beaver Building and a four-story extension at 80 Beaver Street went up for auction in April 1937. The winning bid was from the Bowery Savings Bank, who had bid $500,000. The New York Cocoa Exchange leased more space in the Beaver Building in June 1937. As part of the lease extension, the Bowery Savings Bank hired F. P. Platt & Bros to expand the mezzanine above the first floor for the Cocoa Exchange's use, increasing the exchange's floor area from to . In October 1937, the bank announced plans to renovate the building at a cost of between two and three hundred thousand dollars. The Beaver Building's electrical, heating, and plumbing systems would be replaced, and the facade would be extensively cleaned. The interiors would also receive major modifications, with new automatic elevators and rearranged interior partitions. The first floor partition wall was relocated to the west and a new stair was built to the mezzanine. The Bowery Savings Bank sold the Beaver Building and its four-story annex in 1944 to investor Jerome Greene; at the time, the annex housed the Swan Club. The building was sold again in 1951, this time to an investment syndicate represented by lawyer David Rapoport. At the time, the Buffet Exchange Restaurant and the Cocoa Exchange were both lessees of the space. Records indicate that the lobby was renovated again during 1952, during which deteriorated marble paneling was removed. Sources disagree on the order of subsequent sales. According to The New York Times, the property was then sold to Klausner Associates, and then to investor Arthur H. Bienenstock in 1959, with the latter planning to renovate the elevators and clean the exterior. However, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission states that 82 Beaver Company owned the Cocoa Exchange Building between 1951 and 1981. The Cocoa Exchange moved to 127 John Street in 1972.  Later use  In January 1985, British developers London & Leeds acquired the Beaver Building, at which point about 70% of the space was vacant. After purchasing the building, London & Leeds renamed it One Wall Street Court and renovated the interior. The lobby, elevators, and electrical and HVAC systems were refurbished. Inside, the first-floor partition wall was removed and the mezzanine stair was again replaced. In addition, various improvements were made to the exterior; new windows and window louvers were installed, the base masonry was painted, and metal lights were fixed. The windows in the basement were covered over. The building was purchased by Cocoa Partners in 1994. Sometime after the Cocoa Exchange moved out, the commercial space was occupied by a \\"massive store\\" called J&R; Discount Cigars until 2002. By mid-2004, 1 Wall Street Court was undergoing conversion into a residential building. The conversion was completed around 2006, and the building became a residential condominium development with 126 units. A sushi restaurant was also opened at the building's base. The building was used as the setting for the exterior shots of the Continental Hotel in the 2014 film John Wick.  Critical reception  1 Wall Street Court was one of the first skyscrapers in New York City to use multicolored glazed terracotta. Prior to the 1920s, many buildings in the city did not use such a material, with a few exceptions such as the Madison Square Presbyterian Church and the Broadway‚ÄìChambers Building. The writer Herbert Croly was one of the proponents of such decoration. However, he was critical of its use on 1 Wall Street Court, saying that the tiles did not \\"harmonize with each other, nor do they constitute a pleasing scheme of decoration for the top stories of a tall building\\". Architects' and Builders' Magazine, conversely, stated that the terracotta panels served \\"to strengthen the outline of the building and make it a notable feature amid its surroundings\\". 1 Wall Street Court was made a New York City designated landmark on February 13, 1996. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 6, 2005.

History Mounted orienteering was an important function of cavalry units and today remains an important skill for mounted search and rescue. Competitive sport Mounted orienteering can be completed competitively, either as a discipline in its own right, or as part of a multi- discipline sport such as Trec. The rules between governing bodies vary widely, although all require horsemanship and the ability to read a map and use a compass. There are significant differences between mounted orienteering rules and those set down for foot orienteering by the International Orienteering Federation. Differences concern the map, course, route choice, and control points. Both sports use available maps, usually but not necessarily topographic maps. These maps generally are not appropriate for teaching beginning competitors to use the more advanced skills of field navigation. Hence, the required navigational skills are kept simple. North America American (NACMO) mounted orienteering competitions resemble rogaining in that courses are long and competitors choose the order in which to seek control points, and resemble treasure hunting or fox Oring in that once in the vicinity of a control point the task is to search for (rather than navigate to) a landmark and from there follow a compass heading to the control point. The landmark is described on a clue sheet, and often is not a feature on the map; e.g., the landmark might be a tree of a noted species and size, perhaps marked in some way for the competition. There will be several landmarks in the vicinity of the control point, usually on trails. The intent is to permit competitors who find more than one landmark to use them to triangulate the location of the control point on their map, then ride by the most efficient route directly to the control point. Europe In Europe, there is little mounted orienteering as a stand-alone sport, although there are significant elements present in endurance riding and as a specific event in the multi- discipline sport of Trec.

Sponges of the genus Spongilla attach themselves to rocks and logs and filter the water for various small aquatic organisms such as protozoans, bacteria, and other free-floating pond life. Unlike marine sponges, freshwater sponges are exposed to far more adverse and variable environmental conditions, so they have developed gemmules as a means of dormancy. When exposed to excessively cold or otherwise harsh situations, the sponges form these gemmules, which are highly resistant \\"buds\\" that can live dormant after the mother sponge has died. When conditions improve, the gemmules \\"germinate\\" and a new sponge is born. Spongilla was used by John Hogg in the 19th century to attempt to justify a fourth kingdom of life.

Manx, the historical language of the island, is still maintained by a very small speaker population. Both English and Manx are official languages in Tynwald. Manx A bilingual English/Manx welcome sign in Douglas. The Manx language is a Celtic language of the Goidelic subdivision, and descendant of Old Irish. It is sometimes called Manx Gaelic to distinguish it from the local variety of English. The language was historically the dominant one on the island, but fell out of use during the twentieth century. Following the death of Ned Maddrell in 1974, Manx is now considered to be \\"critically endangered\\". At the present time, less than one hundred children receive their education exclusively in Manx. There are an additional 1,689 second-language speakers, comprising 2.2% of the population of the Isle of Man. The language has been offered in public schools since 1992, and has been mandatory since 2001. English language The English language has replaced Manx as the dominant language on the island. The native dialect is known as Anglo-Manx or Manx English, and has been employed by a number of the island's more notable writers such as T.E. Brown and \\"Cushag\\". which distinguishes itself by considerable influence and a large number of loanwords and phrases from Manx Gaelic. However, this dialect is being supplanted by other dialects of English, especially from north west England. For formal purposes British English is the usual form of English used in the Isle of Man. For many years, the BBC has been the main broadcaster to the island, and many English people have settled in the IOM. Forms of Irish English can also be heard on the island, from both Dublin and Belfast. The island has traditionally had many Irish tourists, and settlers. Other minority languages There are a few people in the island who speak other languages habitually. These include Irish speakers.

Neither of these became extinct, so much as evolved, and Manx diverged from Scottish and Irish forms. During the Middle Ages, the three Gaelic languages maintained a single standard for higher registers and poetry. This is sometimes misleadingly referred to as \\"Classical Irish\\" - despite the fact it was much in use in Scotland and presumably the Isle of Man. It is also known as Classical Gaelic.

Carr then barricaded himself in a convenience store and held a clerk hostage before committing suicide with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. The murders of the law-enforcement personnel prompted national controversy on the proper way to handcuff a suspected criminal, and local media were widely criticized for inhibiting police work while Carr was trapped in the convenience store.  Killings and death  On the morning of May 19, around 10:30 a.m., Carr carried the young son of his girlfriend Bernice Bowen into a fire station. The boy had a gunshot wound to the head, but the circumstances of the injury were unclear -- first Carr claimed that the boy was dragging a rifle and walking around when it accidentally discharged, but later he said that he himself had been holding it when it discharged. Carr, having told police he was Joseph Bennett, the father of the child, ran back to the site of the shooting while being pursued by police. Threatening an officer with a rifle, he dropped it and again ran away, and this time was caught and handcuffed. Tampa Police Department detectives Randy Bell and Ricky Childers took him back to the apartment where the boy had been shot to continue to interview him. On the trip back to the police department, with Bell and Childers in the front seats and Carr sitting behind them, handcuffed in front, Carr successfully unlocked his handcuffs with a key he carried on his person, he then disarmed Childers by snatching his Glock handgun from his shoulder holster. In the struggle that ensued, Carr shot both officers in the face, killing them at the scene. Exiting the car, he carjacked a pickup truck and fled. After briefly visiting his mother and refueling at a local service station, he got on Interstate 75 heading north. The first police officer in pursuit was Florida State Trooper James Crooks, and as he approached, Carr veered onto an exit ramp located in Pasco County, Florida, braked, and exited the truck. As Crooks also braked to a stop, Carr approached and shot him twice in the head, killing him instantly. Getting back in the pickup truck, Carr fled as multiple police cars and a police helicopter pursued him in a high-speed chase and gunfight. With his tires blown out and running low on ammunition, Carr exited the interstate and entered a convenience store, where he took as a hostage Stephanie Kramer, a pregnant clerk. For the rest of the afternoon, he remained in the store, as nearly 200 officers surrounded him. Local radio station WFLA conducted phone interviews in the midst of the crisis, later drawing criticism from both journalism experts and police. At 7:20 p.m., Carr released Kramer and shot and killed himself as the SWAT team forcibly entered the building.  Aftermath  Bowen's son ultimately died, raising the number killed by Carr to four. In later testimony it was revealed that he abused Bowen and her children, and he was found to be a convicted felon with a history of violent crime, including assault of police officers. He was also wanted in several states. In 1999, Bowen was convicted of child neglect for allowing Carr around her children. Prosecutors contended that since Bowen knew of Carr's violent history, she should have never allowed him to be around children. She was sentenced to 15 years in prison.Tampabay: Retrial delayed for girlfriend of cop killer Later in 1999, she was charged with aiding and abetting Carr's escape, as well as for being an accessory to the murders of her son and the three police officers. Even after one officer broke down and begged her to tell them Carr's real name, Bowen didn't do so. Prosecutors claimed that if she had, police would have known he was a convicted felon and used tougher measures in handling him. She was sentenced to 21.5 years in prison, to run concurrently with her child neglect sentence. However, those convictions were thrown out on appeal in 2001. A state appeals court found that prosecutors focused too much on what Bowen should have done to prevent Carr's rampage, rather than what she did after the crimes were committed. The court also acquitted her of aiding and abetting the deaths of her son and Trooper Crooks.Tampabay: Killer's girlfriend wins on appeal She was convicted of the remaining charges in 2002, and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Sentencing guidelines called for only 6‚Äì11 years, but in sentencing her, the judge said that Bowen's lies to police were so egregious that they endangered the public.Tampabay: Once again, Bowen gets 21 years This sentence also runs concurrently with her child abuse sentence, and she was released in October 2016.Inmate Population Information Detail Experts later expressed shock that the detectives had not handcuffed Carr's hands behind his back, but others defended the action, arguing that at the time the detectives thought they were dealing with a bereaved father, not a violent criminal. The media's handling of the situation also received sharp criticism, as in addition to the radio station's live interview, camera crews for local television stations were broadcasting live shots of the area surrounding the convenience store.

The only black player on the team until his senior year, Hill set two records that still stand: total yards receiving, and most passes caught in a single game.\\"Timeline: The Civil Rights Movement in America\\" , 'This Honorable Body:' African American Legislators in 19th Century Tennessee, Tennessee Dept. of State, 2013 After college and graduate school, Hill was an early advocate of minority business enterprise. He became a ground-breaking businessman, with an entrepreneurial range that has included fine restaurants and green energy companies. In the 1990s, he also established business relations in Russia and China. Early years Darryl Hill was the older of two children born to Kermit and Palestine Hill in Washington, D.C.. His family had a history as entrepreneurs. His father, Kermit, owned and operated Hill‚Äôs Transfer Company, which was one of the nation‚Äôs largest black-owned commercial trucking firms in the 1950s and 1960s. Both grandfathers were African American business owners. His great- grandfather, a Native American, was an entrepreneur and the first person of color to be hired by the Washington, D.C. Fire Department. Hill attended public and parochial grade schools in D.C. and entered Jesuit Gonzaga College High School on an academic scholarship; he earned it by a competitive entrance examination. While at Gonzaga, he became the first African American to play football for the school, and in 1959 he led his team to the City Championship. In his senior year, Hill was named first team All DC Metropolitan in football. In track, he was Catholic League champion and record holder in the 400 yard dash and the long jump. College career In 1960 at the age of 16, Hill attended Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio on a football scholarship, where he was the leading scorer and ground gainer on the freshman football team. In 1961, he received a congressional appointment to the United States Naval Academy. He was the first black man to play football at Navy and one of the first to play at any military academy. He starred on Navy‚Äôs plebe team where he was the favorite target for future Dallas Cowboys quarterback and Pro Football Hall of Fame member Roger Staubach. Leading his team in all-purpose yardage, Hill helped them to an 8-1 record. After deciding to resign from the Naval Academy in 1962, Hill was recruited by future ESPN sports analyst Lee Corso, then an assistant coach at University of Maryland, to play for the Terps. Corso had been encouraged by Maryland head coach Tom Nugent to try to find a black athlete to play for his team. Hill was at first hesitant to transfer, saying, \\"I'm no Jackie Robinson. I just want to play football.\\" When told that it might be couple of years before another black man would be recruited, Hill relented. When Hill enrolled into Maryland in September 1962, he became the first African American to receive an athletic scholarship to play sports for a major university in the South. Maryland was a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). Neither it nor the other two major athletic conferences in the South, the Southeastern Conference and the Southwest Conference (now part of the Big 12), had any African Americans playing football for any of their teams. After sitting out one year, Hill played his historic first game on September 21, 1963, at home against North Carolina State. Hill emerged as a top wide receiver for the team. He did not encounter too much racism from other players, but found that coaches and fans could be highly offensive. The Maryland team was protected by National Guard when it went out on the field at the University of South Carolina in Columbia. Nugent received a death threat by telephone and after the game, Hill's teammates helped him get through a crush of hostile fans.John Greenya, \\"Black Man on a White Field\\", Washington Post Magazine, 1 February 2004 With the support of his teammates, Hill played out the season. When they traveled in the South, the team banded together, only staying at hotels and restaurants that would serve Hill. He finished with 43 catches, five short of the ACC record. At the end of that season, the Terps played an away game against the Clemson University Tigers, who were led by coach Frank Howard. After Maryland announced that Hill was to play, Clemson threatened to leave the conference. Howard vowed that his team would not allow any black to play in their stadium, which was popularly known as \\"Death Valley\\" due to the power of their team. They threatened to pull out of the game if Maryland brought Hill. Hill‚Äôs mother, Palestine, was refused general entry to the ‚Äòwhites only‚Äô stadium, but Clemson President Robert Edwards took Mrs. Hill to his private box. The game went on, and Darryl Hill set the ACC record in that game for pass receptions in a game, a record that stood for many years. Business career After a short stint with the New York Jets, Hill entered graduate school and launched his business career. He worked to assist minorities to enter the business economy. In 1969, he became the first Executive Director of the Anacostia Economic Development Corporation in Washington, D.C. He next worked as Executive Director of the Washington, DC Business Development Center and the Greater Washington Business Center. Over ten years his organizations helped 2,500 minority-owned businesses with technical assistance, marketing and financing. He launched the first publicly owned MESBIC (Minority Enterprise Small Business Investment Company). President Richard Nixon appointed Hill as co-chairman of the National Minority Purchasing Council. In 1977, Hill opened W.H. Bone & Company, one of the first black-owned mainstream, fine dining restaurants in the nation. In 1982, Hill moved to Alameda, California. He founded Pacific Energy Corporation and Polaris Energy, which were early green energy businesses. Polaris Energy operated on both coasts and was one of the nation‚Äôs largest minority-owned energy companies. In 1991, Hill turned his business sights to Russia after the break-up of the Soviet Union. He engaged in a number of business ventures, including purchasing a major optical company in the city of Novosibirsk. He took his company Northstar International to Central Siberia, where he formed a forestry joint venture with the government of the Republic of Buryatia. Hill and Northstar also organized a venture in Belem, Brazil to recover sunken timber from the Amazon River. Hill also formed a joint venture with Ideal Packaging Company which is one the largest paperboard packaging company in China. He obtained the exclusive marketing rights for North America. During the 1990s, Hill opened restaurants in Atlanta, Georgia and Washington, D.C. In 2003, Hill became Director of Major Gifts for the University of Maryland Department of Intercollegiate Athletics. During his tenure at Maryland, he completed one of the largest naming rights deals in the history of college athletics when he put together an agreement to name the football field Capital One Field. Hill is Chairman of Kids Play USA Foundation, whose mission is to remove financial barriers from youth sports.

The song mentions many cartoon characters popular in the United States at that time. Lyrics The premise of the song describes what might happen if Christians succeeded in incorporating Christianity into cartoons. According to the song, cartoon characters would then sing their own versions of the word \\"Hallelujah\\". For example, Fred and Wilma Flintstone would sing \\"Yabba-dabba-lujah\\". The song also mentions Scooby-Doo and Shaggy, Astro, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Kermit the Frog, Elmer Fudd, Yogi Bear, Rocky and Bullwinkle, the Smurfs (referred to as \\"all those little blue guys\\"), and Beavis and Butt-head (referred to as Beavis and \\"that other guy\\"). Hidden track Chris Rice wrote the song while in college, as a joke for students, but after much success, his former record label insisted that he record it for a CD. He reluctantly agreed, although only if it was a hidden track. Chris Rice's article on the song Reactions This track has received a lot of criticism from the Christian community due to its theology, more evidence that Rice's satirical intentions went well over the heads of his fans. Chris Rice explains, \\"Also, in correcting my 'theology' in the cartoon song, people were totally missing the fact that the whole song is about soul-less cartoons, none of whom can 'get saved.'\\" _The Fun Times Guide_ The Cartoon Song By Chris Rice _They Will Know Us By Our T-Shirts_ Since When Do Cartoons Have Eternal Souls? This song has also led to a boycott by Bible Belt Conservatives and some fans of Chris Rice's music. According to Rice's website article, Rice's intention was to \\"bring attention to the silliness of the typical Christian over- reaction to Beavis and Butthead during their popularity. By calling Butthead 'the other guy' I was satirizing many who were 'offended' by that name. I was also trying to point out the snobbery of those who would limit Christianity to only a certain type of person. Many fans misinterpreted my satire of THEM as if I were making a statement of my own beliefs. You can see why I have no desire to perpetuate the life of this song.\\" Despite demand for the song, Rice stopped performing the song live in 2004, prompting Rice to write an article for his own official website entitled \\"Eulogy for a Song About Cartoons.\\" In the article Rice explains that his misunderstood intention in writing the song/skit was to mock the commercial-Christian tendency to \\"make a Christian version of everything.\\" Rice states, \\"I was hoping everyone would get the satire, but they missed the satire, and embraced the song as legit.\\" This legitimizing of the song, evidence of his fans' misunderstanding of the purpose of the song/skit, frustrated Rice to the point of eliminating the song from his live performances, as well as refusal to discuss the song in interviews on the air. In 2004, Rice decided to stop playing the song at concerts. He has kept to his decision, despite popular demand for the song, and despite that Christian radio stations played the song frequently at the time.

Initially funded by a local businessman, the company moved to Austin, Texas in 1989 after acquiring venture capital financing from Sevin Rosen Funds and Austin Ventures.Austin American Statesman, March 10, 1989, Page C1Austin Business Journal, December 29, 1995 SunRiver developed the first Fiber Optic Station, a color graphics terminal which relied on a proprietary, patented, \\"bus extension\\" technology in which the parallel data bus of the multi-user computer is serialized and then reconstituted in the terminal device. Custom LSI chips handled both ends of the connection, which later was converted from fiber optic cable using ST connectors, to Category 5 cable. The Cygna 386 Fiber Optic Station was supported with native drivers by the early DR-DOS operating system produced by Digital Research, as well as SCO (Santa Cruz Operation) XENIX and AT&T; UNIX. The Cygna technology did not enjoy extensive commercial success, however, likely due to inherent speed limitations and the popularity of a competing approach offered by Citrix which was later adopted by Microsoft. SunRiver Data Systems later became Boundless Technologies after simultaneously becoming a public corporation and acquiring the Applied Digital Data Systems division of AT&T; in 1994.Press Release, March 27, 1995 By 1997, all of the original founders had left the company. Sometime after departing Boundless, Youngblood founded FlexRadio, and Long founded Viridian Gold; Rice and Hughes have continued to work in the semiconductor industry. In 2003, Boundless Corporation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, was acquired by the majority public stockholders and moved from Hauppauge, NY to Farmingdale, NY, where it produced terminal emulation software, thin client terminals and replacements for old-style text computer terminals. After a series of 2006 transactions the bankrupt but public Boundless Corporation was merged into the seeking-to-be public Haitian Consulting, a manufacturer of fine chemicals. Ironically, Boundless had become a public company by a similar transaction in 1994 when it used the public company, All Quotes Inc., as a merger vehicle to the public market.

He is primarily known as a major conversant with Socrates in the Republic, and the interlocutor during the Allegory of the Cave. He is also referenced briefly in the beginnings of two dialogues of Plato, the Parmenides and Symposium. Biography Glaucon was the older brother of Plato and, like his brother, was in the inner circle of the young affluent students of Socrates. Although little is known about his life, some information can be extrapolated from Plato's writings and from later Platonic biographers. He was born in Collytus,Diogenes La√´rtius, iii. 3 just outside Athens, most likely before 445 BC (as he was old enough to serve in the Athenian army during the Battle of Megara, in 424 BC). His father was Ariston, and his mother was Perictione. According to Diogenes La√´rtius, in his Life of Plato, Plato and Glaucon had a sister, Potone, and a brother, Adeimantus.Diogenes La√´rtius, iii. 4 In Plato's dialogue Parmenides, a half- brother, Antiphon, is also mentioned. According to the Oxford Greek Dictionary the name \\"Glaucon\\" is derived from the adjective glaukommatos (Œ≥ŒªŒ±œÖŒ∫œåŒºŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ) meaning \\"bright-eyed\\", \\"owl-eyed\\", or \\"grey-eyed\\".Pocket Oxford Classical Greek Dictionary, entry \\"Œ≥ŒªŒ±œÖŒ∫œåŒºŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ\\" It is generally considered to be a devotion to Athena, the goddess of wisdom and namesake and guardian deity of the city of Athens. It is unclear whether it was a name given at birth, an epithet for adoration of the goddess, or a nickname given for \\"looking for wisdom.\\" The use of epithets as a name was common: for example, Plato himself had the birth name Aristocles, according to Diogenes, but he was called \\"wide\\" (platon) for his physical build or the breadth of his virtues. Glaucon and at least one of his brothers fought against the Megarians in the Battle of Megara, with the Athenians victorious in 424 BC, during the height of the Peloponnesian War against Sparta and their allies. The brothers are commended for their \\"godlike\\" virtues in battle and for the strength of the bloodline by Socrates in the Republic.Plato, Republic 368a. It is not clear what Glaucon did for a living (if anything since his was an aristocratic family). However, Socrates says that Glaucon is a musician and so can correctly answer questions about musical theory and harmonic proportion,Plato, Republic, 398e which may also imply that like many other Athenians at the time, such as Plato, Glaucon studied the musical and mathematical theories of Pythagoras at some point. Not much is known about Glaucon's love life. In Republic, Socrates is quoted as saying to Glaucon: \\"I know you are or were in love with a lad like that, and I concede the point.\\" It is unknown who this boy was. The context is a conversation about loving someone despite their having a physical flaw. Information on Glaucon after the death of Socrates (399 BC) is unknown. As Plato's dialogues of Socrates do not refer to Glaucon's passing, he most likely died in or around Athens after Socrates. Plato's dialogues Glaucon is featured in several of Plato's dialogues (the Parmenides, Republic and Symposium) and is widely considered to be one of Socrates' more sophisticated interlocutors. Parmenides Glaucon is referenced briefly in the opening lines of this dialogue, along with his brother Adeimantus. They are visiting the agora of Athens, when they greet Cephalus, who is searching for their half-brother Antiphon because he supposedly memorised the conversation between Socrates, Zeno, and Parmenides, years before.Plato, Parmenides 126a‚Äìc Symposium In the prologue of this dialogue, Apollodorus speaks to Glaucon on the road to Athens about a drinking party (symposium), which occurred several years before, when Socrates and his fellows championed human and divine Love. Glaucon had heard a previous account, and the two talk about the event to \\"pass the time\\" on their way to Athens.Plato, Symposium 172b Republic Plato's Republic begins with Socrates and Glaucon, who have just attended the inaugural Athenian celebration of the festival of Bendis, being playfully compelled by Polemarchus and Glaucon's brother Adeimantus and their companions to return with them to the house of Polemarchus, where they find Polemarchus' father Cephalus, his brothers Lysias and Euthydemus and several other guests, including a sophist, Thrasymachus.Plato, Republic 327a‚Äì328c Socrates turns the conversation towards the definition of justice and refutes various accounts, in particular that of Thrasymachus, who maintains that justice is \\"the advantage of the stronger\\". Thrasymachus claims that the authoritative element in each city makes the laws, called \\"just\\". Glaucon revives Thrasymachus' account and attempts to give it the strongest explication he can because he wants to give Socrates a clear and forceful exposition of the claim that justice is valued only for its consequences and not in its own right.Plato, Republic, 357a ff. Glaucon explains that justice is a social contract that emerges between people who are roughly equal in power so no one is able to oppress the others since the pain of suffering injustice outweighs the benefit of committing it. No one, however, values justice for its own sake, and everyone continues to look for opportunities to outdo his fellow citizens. To illustrate the point, Glaucon invokes the story of a ring of invisibility, which was found by an ancestor of Gyges, who then used his power to pursue his own advantage. Having told the story, Glaucon asserts that if there were two such rings, one given to a person who acts unjustly and the other to a person who acts justly, that the just man, with his new power, begins to act exactly like the unjust man. Glaucon is present for the remainder of the discourse, sharing duties as interlocutor with Adeimantus. In Books 2 to 10, however, the interlocutors merely serve as philosophical foils to Socrates' exposition. Glaucon is Socrates' interlocutor for various topics of discussion such as the rearing and education of the just city's \\"Guardian\\" class,Plato, Republic, 450a‚Äìb the nature of beauty and ugliness,Plato, Republic, 506d the qualities of the most evil type of man,Plato, Republic, 576b‚Äìc and the subjects of thought in the immortal mind of Zeus.Plato, Republic, 608b‚Äìd Socrates questions Glaucon about animal husbandry, as related to the breeding of just individuals. It is mentioned that Glaucon is particularly knowledgeable in this topic as he has in his \\"house a number of hunting dogs and a number of pedigreed cocks\\".Plato, Republic, 459a Later, Socrates mentions that Glaucon is a great lover of finery, which leads to their conversation about the attributes and limitations of human love for beauty.Plato, Republic, 402e-403a Elsewhere in Greek literature Glaucon appears in Xenophon's Memorabilia.Xenophon, Memorabilia, Book III, chapter 6 There, Socrates seeks to save Glaucon, not yet twenty, from making a fool of himself before the ecclesia: he set out to make a speech and try to \\"preside\\" over the city, but Socrates reveals to Glaucon his utter ignorance of the actual affairs of state and convinces him not to speak. Glaucon, like many figures in the Memorabilia, is portrayed as rather dim- witted. The passage relating this tale is also notable because it includes the only direct reference in Xenophon's corpus to Plato, for whose sake Xenophon says Socrates intervened. Glaucon appears in Aristotle's Poetics, where Aristotle states: \\"The true mode of interpretation is the precise opposite of what Glaucon mentions. Critics, he says, jump at certain groundless conclusions; they pass adverse judgement and then proceed to reason on it; and, assuming that the poet has said whatever they happen to think, find fault if a thing is inconsistent with their own fancy.\\"Aristotle, Poetics, 11.2 See also *List of speakers in Plato's dialogues NotesExternal links \\"Glaukon's Challenge\\" Glaucon's speech from Republic book 2.

Zarga) near Najaf, Iraq, between Iraqi Security Forces (later assisted by U.S. and UK forces) and fighters, initially thought to be Iraqi insurgents but later reported to be members of the Shia Islam cult Soldiers of Heaven, who had joined a gathering of worshippers ‚Äî or, by other accounts, a conflict, originally between an Iraqi government forces checkpoint and 200 armed pilgrims, which then expanded to include local residents, the Soldiers of Heaven group, and UK and U.S. forces. Iraqi official account In the lead- up to the Day of Ashura, which involves large numbers of pilgrims travelling, some to Najaf, for Shiite festivals, the Iraqi officials were said to have discovered a plot to assassinate the Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani and other Shia religious leaders by the insurgents. Alleged plans called for the insurgents to disguise themselves as pilgrims and suddenly open fire, in attempts to assassinate as many leading Shiite clerics as possible and cause overall disruption of the holiday. Violent attacks have occurred in Najaf during previous Ashura festivals (see Ashura massacre). The initial raid by the Iraqi security forces against suspected insurgent hideout turned into heavy fighting, with the Iraqi Army almost being overwhelmed. The government forces began to retreat but were soon surrounded and pinned down. During the hours-long battle, rebel fighters captured one wounded Iraqi soldier; they treated him at the compound and sent him back to his comrades with a message saying \\"the imam is coming back.\\" At one point the Iraqi forces called on the radio to say that they were running low on ammunition. The fighting became so intense that support from U.S. and British attack helicopters and F-16 fighter jets\\"US-Iraqi Forces Kill 250 Militants in Najaf\\", The Age, 29 January 2007 were called in. The airstrikes carried out by Special Forces operators partnered with the Iraqi Army helped break the stalemate, but not before one American AH-64 attack helicopter was shot down, killing two U.S. soldiers. Military Transition Team (MiTT) 0810 partnered with the Iraqi Army was first to respond to the Apache helicopter crash as the Soldiers of Heaven cult was attempting to seize the crash site. Once the crash site was secured by U.S. forces and the enemy disposition was ascertained, further support was requested. The Iraqi Army was still unable to advance, and they called for support from an Iraqi SWAT team in Hillah and U.S. motorised infantry troops. Around 1:00PM, elements of the Charlie Company 2nd Battalion, 3rd Infantry Regiment, part of 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division were dispatched from near Baghdad. Some of the gunmen managed to break out toward Karbala. On 1 February, the city of Najaf was cordoned off, and subsequently Iraqi Government and U.S. forces appeared to be involved in heavy fighting, including helicopter gunship support. The opposing forces seem to be militants inside the city limits. This seemingly contradicted initial assessment that the hostile group was effectively destroyed after the battle of 28 January, but independently verified information was not available at the time. Controversy Another account of the incident was presented in the newspaper articles by Patrick Cockburn,Patrick Cockburn, The Independent newspaper US 'victory' against cult leader was 'massacre'. 31 January 2007 retrieved 2 February 2007 Dahr Jamail and Ali al-Fadhily.Dahr Jamail and Ali al-Fadhily, Asia Times Pilgrims massacred in the 'battle' of Najaf. 2 February 2007 retrieved 2 February 2007 According to their version of events, at around 6:00AM, Hajj Sa'ad Sa'ad Nayif al-Hatemi, chief of the Hawatim Shia tribe, led a group of armed pilgrims from that tribe to a security checkpoint. Security forces killed al-Hatemi, his wife, and his driver. The pilgrims, who had walked alongside the car to the checkpoint, then attacked the security forces in retaliation. A local tribe, the Khaza'il, tried to stop the fighting but were shot at in the crossfire. Iraqi troops at the checkpoint reported al- Qaeda forces were attacking and more security forces arrived in response, surrounding the Hawatim. The Hawatim tried unsuccessfully to stop the fighting at this stage. Firing continued and a U.S. helicopter was shot down. U.S. aircraft bombarded the area until early the next morning. 120 Hawatim and local residents were killed. The group led by Ahmad al-Hassani was based in the local area of the fighting and was drawn into it. They, the Hawatim and the Khaza'il, are opposed to groups that make \\"the core of the Baghdad government\\". The presence of Ahmad al-Hassani's group provided justification for a massacre of opponents to important groups in the Iraqi government. A radical Shiite cleric, Ayatollah Mahmud al-Hasani al-Sarkhi, was reported on 6 February 2007, to be calling for an independent inquiry into what \\"many in Iraq now regard as a 'massacre' in which scores of women and children were killed.\\" The Speaker of the Iraqi Parliament, Mahmoud al-Mashhadani, accused the government of concealing the truth about the event.Nidhal Laithi, Azzaman The Najaf 'massacre' divides country. 6 February 2007 retrieved 10 February 2007 Aftermath At least six Iraqi policemen, five Iraqi soldiers, and two American soldiers died as a result of the conflict.

He was identified as a deputy to the cult leader Dia Abdul Zahra Kadim, who was believed to be a former security officer from the old regime. Their actual names and identities were also questioned. The U.S. military has referred to them only as gunmen, not insurgents or terrorists. Dia Abdul-Zahra was killed in the fighting while the whereabouts of Ahmed Hassani al-Yemeni were not known. The Iraqi authorities may also have exaggerated their own military success.

C. \\"Introduction.\\" The Background to Shakespeare's Sonnets. New York: Schocken, 1972. 7-17. Print. Synopsis Shakespeare's sonnet cycle has overarching themes of great love and the passage of time. In this sonnet, the speaker is now concentrating on his own death and how the youth is to mourn him after he is deceased. The speaker tells the youth not to mourn for him when he is dead, and that the youth should only think about him for as long as it takes to tell the world of his death. The speaker then tells his beloved youth that if even reading this sonnet will cause him to suffer, he should forget the hand that wrote the poem. Joseph Pequigney writes that the sonnet is a \\"persuasive appeal to be recalled, loved and lamented‚Ä¶a covert counterthesis\\".Schiffer, James.

Web. 29 October 2012 While many critics agree with Peguiney and Booth, and have said that this sonnet is a veiled attempt on the part of the speaker to actually invoke the youth to mourn him, some critics believe differently. Helen Vendler writes that \\"There are also, I believe, sonnets of hapless love--intended as such by the author, expressed as such by the speaker.\\"Vendler, Helen, and Helen Vendler. The Art Of Shakespeare's Sonnets / Helen Vendler. n.p.: Cambridge, Massachusetts : Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1997., 1997. SLU Libraries Catalog. Web. 29 Oct. 2012 Structure Sonnet 71 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. The English sonnet has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form, abab cdcd efef gg and is composed in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The first line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / No longer mourn for me when I am dead (71.1) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. Context Sonnet 71 is one of the first 126 sonnets which address the putative young man.Cheney, Patrick, ed. The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare's Poetry. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007. Print. pg 126. It is more specifically a part of four sonnets (71-74), which are \\"humble bids for affection, cast in tones of deepest gloom.\\"Wait, R. J. C. The Background to Shakespeare's Sonnets. New York: Schocken Books, 1972. Print. pg. 73-74. Sonnets 71 and 72 are linked: a double sonnet.Vendler, Helen. The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1997. Print. pg. 327. Krieger explains the poet's pleas to the beloved friend to cooperate with time and the world in two ways. He pleads for him to not allow love to outlast the poet's life and to not bestow more values on the poet and his work than is warranted.Krieger, Murray. A Window to Criticism: Shakespeare's Sonnets and the Modern Poetics. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1964. Print. pg. 120. Essentially the poet in Sonnet 71 develops the idea that he is one of the causes as to why the youth \\"is suspect of the wise world.\\"Baldwin, T. W. On the Literary Genetics of Shakespeare's Poems and Sonnets. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1950. Print. pg. 248. Analysis=Quatrain 1 > No longer mourn for me when I am dead Than you shall hear the surly sullen > bell Give warning to the world that I am fled From this vile world, with > vilest worms to dwell: According to Guyer, the first line says that once the speaker of the sonnets is dead there should be no mourning, but it is phrased in such a way that says the mourning is happening now, at a point in life and living. Guyer's interpretation focuses heavily on time and the importance of that time used for mourning. In the line there is a limit of time being set aside for mourning, only in life, but after life has ended the mourning must stop. The line ends in dead, finality, giving the false sense that the sentence is over and yet it continues through to the second line. The second line gives the brief time between life and the sound of the bell to mourn and it seems to contradict the first line. The sonnet seems to be firmly against mourning after death, but really it is for mourning the dead but only in a timely manner. \\"The sonnet's first-person subject demands that mourning‚Äîeven if it lasts only for one minute or one day‚Äîcoincides with, rather than succeed, the death knell that will \\"Give warning to the world that I am fled.\\"Guyer, Sara. \\"Breath, Today: Celan's Translation of Shakespeare's Sonnet 71.\\" JSTOR. JSTOR, 2005. Web. 10 Oct. 2012. . Guyer continues on to say that the \\"Giving warning\\", describes the bell's message and follows the imperative tense of the first line, [You] give warning mirrors [you] no longer mourn. \\"The bell that marks the death also marks the duration of the addressee's mourning, and thus sounds a second obligation.\\" The word fled insinuates a presence not no longer existing but being off and gone somewhere else or displaced, an absence. The use of the word dead implies there is no return, while the use of fled opens possibilities of returning.Guyer, Sara. \\"Breath, Today: Celan's Translation of Shakespeare's Sonnet 71.\\" JSTOR. JSTOR, 2005. Web. 10 Oct. 2012. . The last line of the first quatrain follows the fled term, \\"fled\\", or fleeing from a \\"vile\\" world and insinuates that the next world is even worse as it is where the vilest worms dwell. This creates the question of if it is any better after death than it was in life.Guyer, Sara. \\"Breath, Today: Celan's Translation of Shakespeare's Sonnet 71.\\" JSTOR. JSTOR, 2005. Web. 10 Oct. 2012. . Booth takes a different approach to the sonnets. He suggests that the entire sonnet is an \\"emblem of the poets self-mocking tactics. He argues that though the sonnet works to remind the reader to forget the speaker, it is also contradicts as it constantly reminds the reader of the speaker. His comment on the reading of the first quatrain is that, the experience of reading the poem \\"an experience of being unable to get on to something new.\\" Booth sees the \\"Give warning\\" not only as a literal warning of death but a comment of mortality, \\"an idea that undercuts the advice the speaker purports to offer by inviting a wider view of all particular deaths that his mundane premises allow for.\\" This reading takes a particular view of the speaker and highlights the theme of aging in the sonnets.Booth, Stephen. Shakespeare's Sonnets. New Haven: Yale UP, 1977. Print. Quatrain 2 > Nay, if you read this line, remember not The hand that writ it; for I love > you so That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot If thinking on me then > should make you woe. In quatrain two, the speaker implores the young man to forget the hand that wrote the sonnet if the mere thought of the speaker would cause him to mourn. This is particularly ironic considering that there are lines in other sonnets (e.g., Sonnet 18, Sonnet 55, Sonnet 65 and Sonnet 81) that speak of immortality through poetic verse, thus negating the possibility that one can be forgotten. These examples give credence to Peguiney's argument of a calculated attempt to invoke the youth's mourning, as he writes in his essay Sonnets 71‚Äì74, \\"The 'if' clauses at lines 5 and 9 are cunning invitations to future readings of the verse, and how impossible it would be for 'you [to] read this [handwritten] line' and 'remember not / The hand that writ it'\\" (p 287). In this same vein, Stephen Booth writes that the \\"narcissistic smugness of the speaker's gesture of selflessness is made ridiculously apparent by the logic of the situation he evokes: a survivor rereading a poem about forgetting the deceased speaker must necessarily be reminded of him.\\"Shakespeare, William, and Stephen Booth. Shakespeare's Sonnets / Edited With Analytic Commentary By Stephen Booth. n.p.: New Haven : Yale University Press, 1977., 1977. SLU Libraries Catalog. Web. 29 Oct. 2012 Conversely, Helen Vendler, in her book The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets, writes that this sonnet can indeed be read honestly, that is, as a real-life love predicament wherein two lovers are having a candid discussion of their love for one another. Here, she writes a suicidal dialogue from which she infers the sonnet could have been written: > Poet: I am going to flee this vile world, preferring a dwelling with vilest > worms to any further existence here. What will you do after my death? > Beloved: I will mourn you forever. Poet: No, mourn for me no longer than it > takes to toll my passing bell. Beloved: Well, then I will read your lines, > and grieve while reading them. Poet: Nay, if you read this line, remember > not the hand that wrote it, if that memory would cause you grief. Beloved: > Then I will, from love, mention your name to others. Poet: No, do not > rehearse my name, but let your love for me cease when me life does. Beloved: > Why do you forbid me to remember you, grieve for you, read you, name you? > Poet: Because the world, which has so mocked me, will then associate you > with me, and you will find yourself by association.Vendler, Helen, and Helen > Vendler.

Web. 29 Oct. 2012 This reading is also possible, as the speaker in other sonnets did speak of his name having a stigma attached to it (Sonnet 111), of being despised and disgraced by men (Sonnet 29), and also of being battered and oppressed by the world (Sonnet 27 and Sonnet 28). Quatrain 3 > O, if, I say, you look upon this verse When I perhaps compounded am with > clay, Do not so much as my poor name rehearse. But let your love even with > my life decay, Throughout the entire sonnet there seems to be a movement of mourning from very real and apparent to basically vanished. By quatrain 3 the subject \\"narrows from the hand to the mere name [of the speaker]‚Äîas if to render the mourning ever more tenuous, while having the beloved still enact the putatively wished-for behavior.\\" Vendler points out the increasingly distanced view of the speaker and his expression. By this quatrain \\"the speaker is wholly compounded‚Ä¶ with clay, dissolved into dust.\\"Vendler, Helen. The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1997. Print. pg. 329. The sonnet as a whole leads the reader's mind and emotion to the climax, line 12.Ingram, W. G. \\"The Shakespearean Quality\\". New Essays on Shakespeare's Sonnets. Ed. Hilton Landry. New York: AMS Press, 1976. Print. pg. 49. It is in this line that there is an affirmation of the return of love.Pequigney, Joseph. \\"Sonnets 71-74: Texts and Contexts\\" Shakespeare's Sonnets: Critical Essays. Ed. James Schiffer.

James Schiffer. New York: Garland Publishing, 199. Print. pg. 286. As par the structure of this particular quatrain, it seems to tie the sonnet all together. As Ingram illustrates, \\"line 10 look[s] back to lines 1-4\\" and \\"line 11 and 12 to the gentler, un-self-regarding tone of lines 5-8.\\" Additionally, these lines within quatrain three contrast because of line 10's \\"harsh alliterating c's and echoic 'compounded'\\" and line 12's \\"soft alliterating l's\\".Ingram, W. G. \\"The Shakespearean Quality\\". New Essays on Shakespeare's Sonnets. Ed. Hilton Landry. New York: AMS Press, 1976. Print. pg. 61-62. Atkins adds \\"as Ingram and Redpath note, [there is] a great variety of stress , supplying a fluidity that, surprisingly perhaps, allows the author to keep the third quatrain's interloped feet ('I say' [line 9], 'perhaps' [line 10]) and reversed word order ('compounded am' [line 10]) from appearing clumsy.\\"Atkins, Carl D., ed.

While the quatrains lead up to a climax in quatrain 3, the couplet suggests a point, a succinct conclusion.Ingram, W. G. \\"The Shakespearean Quality\\". New Essays on Shakespeare's Sonnets. Ed. Hilton Landry. New York: AMS Press, 1976. Print. pg. 53. According to Atkins, in the couplet \\"The primary notion is that the world will judge the poet's shortcoming only too well,\\" as clarified by Tucker [1924]. After the speaker's urge for the beloved not to mourn him, one might expect several different orthodox explanations at the conclusion. Instead of what is expected \\"we get: 'Forget me when I am dead ‚Äì after all, someone might make fun of you.'\\"Atkins, Carl D., ed. Shakespeare's Sonnets: With Three Hundred Years of Commentary. Cranbury, NJ: Associated University Press, 2007. Print. pg. 192-193. Alternately, Pequigney believes \\"the answer [as to what the couplet means] depends on our mood as we read it.\\" He maintains that \\"we learn more about ourselves when we interpret this poem than we do about its author.\\"Pequigney, Joseph. \\"Sonnets 71-74: Texts and Contexts\\" Shakespeare's Sonnets: Critical Essays. Ed. James Schiffer. New York: Garland Publishing, 199. Print. Overall, \\"the couplet is superbly organized, both in the management of its rhythms and in its backward verbal reflection to the patterning of the whole poem.\\"Ingram, W. G. \\"The Shakespearean Quality\\". New Essays on Shakespeare's Sonnets. Ed. Hilton Landry. New York: AMS Press, 1976. Print. pg. 62. Irony There seems to be a couple different types of irony in the sonnets in general that which is \\"openly voiced by the speaker and authorial irony suggested at the expense of the (deceived) speaker.\\"Vendler, Helen. The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1997. Print. pg. 327. There seems to a sense of irony when the speaker tells the beloved to forget him. Schoenfeldt reasons that \\"we cannot quite take these lines literally\\" because \\"to tell someone to forget something is to make it harder for them to forget.\\" This demonstrates a certain \\"reverse-psychology appeal\\" as a sense of irony.Schoenfeldt, Michael, ed. A Companion to Shakespeare's Sonnets. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing, 2007. Print. pg. 356. Furthermore \\"the shift from the 'vile world' (line 4) to the 'wise world' (line 13) is the final evidence of Shakespeare's irony\\" in this particular sonnet. Krieger goes on to explain: \\"For this world is wise‚Äîthat is, shrewd, prudential‚Äîonly as it is vile, only as it exercises those characteristics which ape the destructive perfection, the absolute cooperation with time, of the 'vilest worms.'\\" He questions, \\"How single-mindedly, then, is his friend to take this selfless, seemingly anti-sentimental injunction to obey the dictates of the world's cold wisdom lest he be mocked by it?\\"Krieger, Murray.

The first appeared in Brave and the Bold #59 (April‚ÄìMay 1965). He was created by Bob Haney and Ramona Fradon. The second appeared in JSA Classified #34 (2008). He most recently appeared in Super Sons #7 following DC's Rebirth of its titles. Fictional character biography John Starr was a brilliant scientist who turned to crime after the demise of the artificial humanoid project which employed him. He was soon imprisoned, and while incarcerated perfected the Hourglass, which harnessed electricity and gave control over time itself. Calling himself the Time Commander, the ‚ÄúModern Monte Cristo,‚Äù Starr‚Äôs criminal career focused on rewriting his past: making himself appear ‚Äúrailroaded‚Äù into prison, and killing his former employer. These early schemes were foiled by Batman and Green Lantern.Brave and the Bold #59 (Apr‚ÄìMay 1965) Years later, Starr‚Äôs agenda then took a turn for the grandiose, as he began resurrecting the dead by reversing time‚Äôs flow, with the goal of returning humanity literally to the Eden. Elongated Man, Metamorpho and Rocket Red join up with Animal Man and they track down Time Commander. It is revealed, however, that Starr is reversing time in positive ways, such as granting one woman youth and bringing back a dead man. Regardless, Time Commander swiftly defeats most of them, even destroying Rocket Red's armor. Animal Man notices the positive effects but is not sure if it is a good idea in the long run. Time Commander notes he is making life more interesting in general; furthermore that Animal Man doesn't seem like a bad person, just that Starr doesn't want any more psychiatric help. Metamorpho, recovered, smashes Time Commander's hourglass and knocks Starr out with one punch; not noticing that his positive time reversals are now no more.Animal Man #16 (Oct 1989) Starr is freed from prison by the Calendar Man with the intent to join with the Clock King and Chronos as the Time Foes. The villains aimed to recover Starr's hourglass, but were confronted by the Team Titans. Calendar Man asks Starr to use his hourglass in battle. He claims he cannot do it, as it is an instrument for good (despite him having used it to smack around the heroine Redwing moments earlier); and also, the hourglass is broken. Starr is not seen actually fighting in the resulting battle, he is admonished later by his captured allies for just having surrendered. Starr explains he is misunderstood, at heart he is a peaceful man.Team Titans #13-14 (Oct-Nov 1993) After an encounter later with Epoch, the Time Foes become stuck in a temporal loop (as a result of the dawning moments of Zero Hour affecting reality).Showcase '94 #10 (1994) Unable to free himself or his teammates, John Starr seemed doomed to perish there; although they somehow escape later, as the Foes were later seen in other stories post-Zero Hour. Death Years later, in a reality affected by two time crises (Zero Hour and Infinite Crisis) since the Time Foes were last seen, Waverider is in a clock store when time freezes. Time Commander appears inside of an hourglass and berates Waverider for his failed promises to make Starr, Chronos and other villains Time Masters in exchange for joining his fight. Starr then dissolves into sand, killed by Skeets, the robot ally to the time-travelling Booster Gold (who is, in fact, a disguised and timetravelling Mister Mind); Waverider is swiftly killed as well.52 #27 (Nov 2006) Successor Sterling Fry took up the Time Commander name after his mentor, John Starr, was killed. He kidnapped Liberty Belle in an attempt to steal Hourman's hourglass. Time Commander beat Hourman and took the hourglass from him. After releasing the tachyon particles from the hourglass, Fry disappeared. Whether his exposure to the particles killed him or not is not known at this time.JSA Classified #34 (Mar 2008) Soon after, Time Commander encounters the Justice League, who have been scattered through time by Epoch, and helps them. Although he appears to be acting as a hero, it transpires that in addition to acquiring Epoch's time displacement gauntlet, he also recovered the original Time Commander's hourglass from the JLA trophy room. It is not made clear if this Time Commander is Sterling Fry or a new character, or even (thanks to time travel) John Starr himself.Justice League of America 80-Page Giant #1 (2009) DC Rebirth He is shown post- flashpoint/new 52 for the first time in Super Sons #7 as an artificial forgotten villain created by an elderly magician named Kraklow using a mysterious clay given to him by a future/multiversal version of himself.

The Humorous Courtier was licensed for performance by Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, on 17 May 1631, under the title The Duke.Arthur Huntington Nason, James Shirley, Dramatist: A Biographical and Critical Study, New York, 1915; reprinted New York, Benjamin Blom, 1967; p. 102. Robert Stanley Forsythe, The Relations of Shirley's Plays to the Elizabethan Drama, New York, Columbia University Press, 1914; p. 279. Both Nason and Forsythe sensibly reject F. G. Fleay's argument that another title, The Conceited Duke, is the same play, since the Duke in Shirley's play isn't conceited. Like most of Shirley's plays, it was acted by Queen Henrietta's Men at the Cockpit Theatre. As The Humorous Courtier, the play was entered into the Stationers' Register on 29 July 1639. The 1640 quarto, printed by Thomas Cotes for the bookseller William Cooke, contains an interesting bibliographic feature in its prefatory material: a catalogue of 20 plays by Shirley published to that date.David Moore Bergeron, Textual Patronage in English Drama, 1570-1640, London, Ashgate, 2006; p. 207. Such catalogues were only then coming into existence. (Since Cooke had already published a number of Shirley's plays, this promotional catalogue served his own interest.) As its title indicates, the play is a humors comedy. That subgenre was initiated by George Chapman with his An Humorous Day's Mirth (1597), but is most strongly associated with Ben Jonson, whose plays Every Man in His Humour and Every Man Out of His Humour defined the form. Later writers also worked in the humors vein, as John Fletcher did in his tragicomedy The Humorous Lieutenant (c. 1619). As the Duchess of Mantua says of her courtiers, \\"They are mad humours, and I must physic them.\\" Synopsis The Duke of Parma, Foscari, has been plying his marriage suit to the Duchess of Mantua‚Äîbut he suddenly disappears from her court. The Duchess announces that she intends to select a husband from her own courtiers. Egged on by her new favorite Giotto and her lady in waiting Laura, each lord flatters himself that he is the favored candidate. Depazzi practices his eloquence with rehearsed speeches, while Volterre prides himself on his command of foreign languages. Contarini, a married man, actually tries to convince his wife to kill herself to leave him single again; when she naturally declines, he attempts to bribe Giotto into committing adultery with her so that a divorce can result. The misogynistic Orseolo portrays himself as a great lover; the elderly Comachio joins his compatriots in making a fool of himself. In the end, the Duchess gently mocks and reproves her eccentric courtiers, and announces that she will marry Giotto‚Äîwho turns out to be the Duke of Parma in disguise.

The school traces its history to a segregation academy founded by the White Citizens Council. History Hillcrest Christian school was originally founded as a segregation academy by the Whites Citizens Council. Racial segregation Hillcrest was established in 1970 as a segregation academy in response to the court-ordered integration of public schools. In 1985, W.J Simmons, chair of the state White Citizens Council, discussed the history of the school with Clarion-Ledger. Simons acknowledged that \\"Race was a motivating factor in the early days.\\" Simmons also stated \\"admitting blacks lowers educational standards. Racial mixing is wrong when it's forced. And if it's not forced, it's not likely to occur.\\" In the same article, headmaster Gary McGee said that he didn't know if the Hillcrest Christian school would admit black students and that if a black student applied for entrance, the matter would need to be discussed by the school's trustees. Campus The current campus was originally known as Council McCluer, which was a separate school opened the same year as Hillcrest. Council McCluer was part of a system of twelve schools in Jackson founded and run by the Citizens' Council of Jackson. For much of its early life, the school was located at Sykes Road and Wheatley Drive in south Jackson, and operated as a K-9 school. In 1985 the school merged with the McCluer Academy, another segregation academy. The combined school used the former McCluer Academy campus on Siwell Road for the high school and middle school. The school ultimately moved all operations to that campus and sold the Wheatley property in the late 1990s following the construction of an elementary school building at the Siwell campus. Education Hillcrest educates pupils from kindergarten 3 to grade 12.Hillcrest Christian School, Official site Hillcrest Christian School has a variety of clubs and organizations.

It traces its history back over two centuries, to the years prior to mandatory public education. History= Early school  The school traces its history back to the early days of the United States. The Rev. George H. Spierin proposed to open an \\"Academy\\" in Newburgh. Work began in 1796 under the direction of the trustees of the glebe. (A glebe was land originally set aside in the early 18th century for a pastor and his church. The glebe for the Newburgh area was issued in 1719.) A portion of the first Academy was occupied in 1797. The building was by 40 feet (18.5 √ó 12.3m), two stories high, built of wood, and lined with brick. It was located on Liberty Street and cost around $2,500. The building was not finished until some years later when a court room was included. The building itself saw use as not only a school and court, but was also site for town meetings and political organizations. The first record of a teacher employed was in 1799 when Samuel Nicholson was hired. The Academy had only one teacher during its first eight years of existence. In 1807 management of the school passed from the hands of the trustees of the Glebe to a regularly incorporated Board of Trustees. At that time rates for tuition were adopted. The charge per quarter was $2.50. This was for the study of writing and arithmetic. A scholar studying Greek, Latin or French was charged $5.00 per quarter. In 1807 Richard A. Thompson was employed as principal. He lived in the school rent free and was paid $100 at the end of the year. He also received all money arising from the tuition of scholars attending the Academy. A Female Department was established at the Academy in 1809. Reading, writing, sewing, and drawing were taught. On April 6, 1852 the New York State Legislature authorized the establishment and organization of free schools in Newburgh. Within a month free education was introduced into what was then the village of Newburgh. The Academy then came under the control of Board of Education as the senior department of the Newburgh Public Schools. In 1871 a three-year course of study was arranged, at the completion of which students were required to take a written examination. Those who passed the examination were granted diplomas as graduates. The first Commencement Exercises were held on April 28, 1871, and included the participation of a Salutatorian and Valedictorian.  Second Montgomery Street Academy  Ten years after the first official Commencement Exercises the Academy had outgrown itself. A \\"new\\" Academy was built on the grounds of the formal school on Montgomery Street in 1886 for around $70,000. Designed by Ehrick Rossiter and partner Frank A. Wright, a former student, the school had three stories and a basement. The three floors contained twelve school rooms, a large assembly room that could fit six to seven hundred people, a drawing room, a laboratory, an annex, and janitor's quarters. Each school room contained desks for 45 students, and was equipped with countersunk ink wells, black boards, closets, and electric bells. It had a brick frontage of 112 feet and a depth of 68 feet, each classroom 33 1/2 x 23 feet. Light was designed to enter over the student's left shoulders to help them when writing. The stairwells were also noted as being broad. September 2, 1886, 201 students registered for classes at the \\"new\\" Academy, which now housed grammar and academic classes. Actual classes began on September 20. It was also during 1886 that \\"the free book system\\" was adopted by the Board. Three years later on July 7, 1889 the Board received a certificate of admission of the Academy to the University of the State of New York. Soon afterwards a definite standard was set up for graduation, and the high school course was extended to four years. In September of that year the department plan of teaching, that is assigning teachers to subjects rather than to grades, was adopted. Three courses of study were established: English, Scientific, Latin-Scientific, and Classical. It was also in 1886 that corporal punishment was abolished. A superintendent's report says that \\"the unlimited use of the rod is certainly not desirable.\\" Six years after moving into its \\"new\\" Montgomery Street building the Academy adopted its school colors: navy blue and gold.  Fullerton Avenue  Compulsory education laws such as those of 1894, and increasing population in the city resulted in an enlarged high school enrollment. The need for a larger and more modern building was becoming increasingly evident as our school and country entered the 20th century. In 1926 construction began on a lot at the corner of Fullerton Avenue and South Street for a million dollar building, which was to accommodate 1,500 students. (Note: All three previous Academy buildings were built within the original glebe boundaries.) On January 23, 1928 the first classes were held in the present Newburgh Free Academy building, but it was not until March 1928 that the construction work was finally completed. In the fall of 1931, an annex was added to the building, adding dressing rooms, a music room, and an additional place for gym work. In 1936, WPA muralist Lee Woodward Zeigler was hired by the Board of Education to paint murals in either the auditorium or vestibule. A part-time New Windsor resident, Zeigler was a popular muralist at the height of his career. He favored the idea of possibly painting the Muses, but the Board of Education supported the depiction of a local historical scene or something more academic. Boston architect Ralph Adams Cram wrote to Zeigler and recommended that he create a set of murals to depict the progress of education in Western world, from the School of Athens to the College of William & Mary. Zeigler thought this subject matter was too arresting, and that visitors would not grasp the images. He decided to paint two vertical murals, flanking the stage, featuring Renaissance figures meant to represent the dramatic arts and music. In the first ten years of its occupancy pupil enrollment grew from about 1,100 to more than 2,200. The teaching staff increased from 39 to more than 75. To relieve the overcrowding Columbia University Teachers College recommended that two new junior high schools should be built in order to keep Newburgh up with the times. In spite of the Great Depression, two schools, North Junior High School which still stands and operates on Route 9W and South Junior High School which also still stands and operates on Monument Street, were built with the aid of a 45% grant from the Public Works Administration. In 1937 both buildings were dedicated, and the Academy began to see its enrollment drop back to around 1,500 pupils. = Addition of Science Wing = In the early 1960s, as the baby boomer generation reached high school age, a major addition was built on the north side of the building along Roe Street. The wing was designed to meet Space Age sensibilities, incentivizing students to enter STEM careers. Among the new features were a planetarium, laboratories for chemistry and physics, a greenhouse, mobile animal cabinets, a climatorium for weather measurements, courtyard and a 250-seat lecture room with a dividing wall. A dark room for photography and a TV studio were also added. The planetarium was built with a 30-foot dome visible to passersby, fitted with 90 adjustable seats and used a Model A3P Prime machine. Students in the elementary and junior high schools would be brought there on field trips for their science curriculum. It is no longer in full use. The new addition opened for classes in September 1965. In October, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy held a Democratic Rally in the city and came to speak to students. = Racial Tension = The school was fairly diverse by the end of the 1960s. While it had been majority WASP for much of its history, by the 1940s the school was becoming majority Italian, Irish and German. Smaller populations included African Americans, Greeks, Poles and the addition of Puerto Ricans in the late 1960s. Isolated skirmishes began to occur between white students and students of color. Racial tensions only escalated with Urban renewal, as many students of color and their families were displaced. Many black students voiced concerns and grievances about treatment they deemed unfair. Militant 18-year-old student George Fleming and others petitioned for a Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcom X assembly in school. Fleming had also requested busing to school for students living in the city. He and other classmates were aligned with the Blank Panthers. On April 23, 1969, Fleming and two of his friends entered the principal's office with unloaded BB guns as protest. The teens were immediately arrested and sent to jail for 15 days. In court, William Kunstler represented Fleming. During the trial, he was held in contempt four times for his use of \\"black ghetto American language.\\" Fleming told Kunstler he accepted him because he was the blackest white man he had ever met. = Addition of West Wing = In more recent years, pupil enrollment numbers in the upper two thousands is not uncommon, yet Newburgh Free Academy is prided on still providing a quality education for each and every student, with class sizes ranging between four and thirty-five. In 2002, construction began on the installment of an additional building connected to the original site. Construction ended in early 2003, providing 35+ classrooms, a black-box theatre and a state of the art dance education classroom. The courtyard of the Science Wing became a cafeteria. In 2004 NFA, and the school district as a whole, became the first K‚Äì12 educational system in New York State to deal with an employed district- wide administrator going through a gender transition while on the job. Because of such resistance from the adults on campus, not generally the students, the school board paid this individual a hefty cash settlement (greater than $90,000) to resign. = Creation of North and West Campuses = Beginning with the 2011‚Äì12 school year, Newburgh Free Academy extended to two campuses, utilizing the former North Junior High building, now known as \\"NFA North Campus\\" The current school building becoming \\"NFA Main Campus.\\" Both buildings hold students in grades 9-12, in an effort to meet state requirements for a standard high school. The concept is that both high schools are combined, and all activities stretch between the two campuses. Communication between the two campuses is not yet well established. The enrollment figure for NFA collectively is expected to increase to 5,000 students. In 2016, the district opened a new campus in the former West Street School, close to the two campuses. Of the new campus, which is described as a \\"non-traditional high school\\" the district said: > \\"NFA West Campus is a school of choice. Honoring student choice paves the > way for students to take charge of their education. The Goal of this campus > is to provide positive learning experiences that are flexible and > personalized. Not all students are successful in a traditional environment. > We strive to provide opportunities for academic success through non- > traditional approaches to learning in a supportive environment. NFA West is > a Big Picture Learning (BPL) school that strives to be a place where > students are known well, understood, respected and able to have genuine > relationships with adults. Each scholar's educational program involves > authentic experiences with real world standards and consequences, and is > designed by the people who know the student best. Students‚Äô learning plans > grow out of their individual needs, interests, and passion.\\" Split between Main and North is the CTE program, which hosts programs in Architectural/Engineering Design, Automotive, Barbering, Ceramics, Cosmetology, Culinary Arts, Fashion, Lifetime Wellness and Fitness, Performing Arts, Visual Arts, Welding, & AFJROTC at Main. North offers Criminal Justice, Health Related Services, and is also the home of P-Tech program. The schools also have interscholastic sports and club activities. They include debate, youth in government, drama, step and hip-hop dance, Anime, Spanish club, photography, yearbook, ski and snowboard, and the Concept Vehicle Racing Team, which has designed, built, test driven, and raced fuel efficient vehicles from scratch and raced in the California marathon semi finals. The school's student literary and art magazine, The Colonnade, has been in print since the 1930s.  First Attendance Scandal  Beginning in 2011, the high school was involved in a scandal concerning widespread class cutting and poor graduation rates among Newburgh Free Academy basketball players during their state championship in 2008‚Äì09 and the 2009‚Äì10 season. Star players on the 2008‚Äì09 and 2009‚Äì10 teams told the Times Herald-Record they skipped classes as their coach and administrators looked the other way or actively covered for them. Attendance records later obtained by the paper showed the top six players skipped more than 1,000 classes. E-mails showed NFA teachers had notified top administrators only to see their concerns brushed away. It was only after the allegations became public that the district took any corrective actions. NFA's Principal Peter Copeletti and Athletic Director Chris Townsend both retired during the investigation. Coach Frank Dinnocenzio was replaced. Assistant Principal Karriem Bunce was suspended.  Student Activism in 2018  After the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, 11th grade students immediately organized to rally against gun violence. A group of about 20 students participated in a nation-wide school walkout on March 14 to end gun violence. Wearing orange in solidarity, the students left their classrooms and gathered in front of the school. This quickly garnered safety concerns from the district. Other smaller demonstrations were held indoors, and students sat or laid down in the hallways as protest. While many students were focused on school shootings, others expressed concern for gun violence in Newburgh and those that had been lost to it. An 11th grader approached school administrators to organize a Week of Awareness on topics including bullying, suicide prevention and gun violence. On March 23, two grade assemblies on gun violence and mass shootings were held, allowing students to speak. Some controversy emerged as an anti-gun control student prepared to speak in opposition to the students. The morning of the assembly, they withdrew their name from the lineup. 11th graders made speeches on issues related to the shooting, including the role of mental health statistics. This was in response to President Donald Trump's tweets blaming mass shootings solely on poor mental health. A representative from Moms Demand Action, Tom Campbell of the Newtown Action Alliance and James Skoufis were present. During the month of March, a school shooting scare occurred when a YouTube video surfaced of an 11th grader referring to himself as a school shooter. In the video, the student poked fun at comments people had made about him, a recurrent one being that his appearance and behavior likened that of a school shooter. Without this context, students brought the video to administration and many did not return to school for the rest of the week.  Second Attendance Scandal  After the 2011 scandal, the school set new policies to prevent one from happening again, setting stricter guidelines and requiring more reporting from faculty and staff. Administration changed in 2015 and Raul Rodriguez became principal. In 2016, a former girls varsity basketball coach noticed that the school's attendance system, Infinite Campus, seemed to alter a student athlete's attendance record. Days earlier, the coach had notified administration that the student was ineligible to attend a state track competition due to exceeding excused absences. After notifying them, he checked Infinite Campus to find the student's attendance in excellent standing, contrary to its initial appearance. He wrote to the New York State Education Department on May 18, 2017, notifying them attendance policies may have been changed illegally. After following up on June 23 and July 28, the department neglected to respond as to whether they had investigated the school. In September, they opened an investigation on their own. On the morning of October 23, 2018, officers from the Orange County District Attorney arrived at the Board of Education and Newburgh Free Academy. They served administration with a search warrant, seeking the district's attendance policies regarding academics and athletic participation. Later in the day, the district released a statement agreeing to comply. In January 2019, a grand jury began looking into attendance findings, as the FBI began looking for witnesses and the Orange County DA began to seize information from the Board of Education. Many employees of the district pointed to the credit recovery program APEX as a continuing problem. The program had been enforced and misused. Failing students could stay after school to recover credits. According to the investigation, dozens of APEX students completed coursework for a 45-day quarter in under two hours, including six who did so in 20 minutes or less. Teachers alleged they were told they could provide unlimited chances for quizzes and assignments. Many of the student athletes had been chronically absent with \\"illness\\" but had managed to get the excessive absences cleared. The investigation also found that 65 of the 110 students whose records were examined averaged 100 or more class absences per year. One student had 2,276 class absences, plus 1,272 latenesses, in four years. As the investigation went on, ineligible students were found to be actively participating in football, boys soccer, wrestling, baseball and track. Many community members, tax payers, parents and teachers were torn on the investigation. While many believed it to be necessary but upsetting, they felt the news media was finding opportunities to display Newburgh in a negative light. Several events occurred simultaneously with the investigation. On Thursday, February 8, a science teacher at Main Campus was attempting to remove a student from a cafeteria when he was body slammed by the student onto the floor. The teacher, serving on lunch duty, was alone in his efforts and hospitalized. The student, a minor, was charged with felony assault, and was discovered to be skipping class in the cafeteria. As a result, a stricter attendance policy was enforced with the pressure of the attendance investigation. Teachers became outraged when a lack of sympathy was given, and believed that Main Campus had been neglected by the Board of Education because it was oversized and lacked resources. They led a demonstration in solidarity outside Main Campus. At a Board of Education meeting, two teachers testified on behalf of their coworker. One presented that student ID scanning machines had been broken for months and that teachers were subjected to dangerous working conditions. On the morning of Monday, April 8, a mother trying to sign her 10th grade son out of school got into an argument with security. Humberto Perez, a police resource officer, got involved. The officer noticed that the woman's son appeared to have a kitchen knife concealed in his pants. When questioned about the knife, the student and officer had a brief altercation which resulted in deep cuts on the officer's hand. The officer was hospitalized and the student did not face charges. Further questioning revealed that he had been attacked and robbed on April 3 near First Street and City Terrace in Newburgh. The student was cornered and attacked at an abandoned house while walking home from school. About 50 to 70 others were present at the scene. The beating was filmed and spread on social media. In connection, seven students were arrested for felony robbery, two of which were under the age of 17 and three of which were student athletes. The student clarified that he brought the knife into the school to protect himself from bullies and his attackers. He had previously been attacked at Main Campus by bullies. His mother claims that faculty did not provide the help he needed. Online, death threats were made to the student and his family. In regard to the student accidentally injuring the officer, one commented: \\"Kid should have been shot, it would have been justified.\\" Police wondered how a serrated kitchen knife was able to get through school security. It tightened after the incident. In early May, a student at Main Campus released a homemade trailer on YouTube for an anti-bullying documentary he planned to film. The trailer, which featured videos of Main Campus, was brought to the attention of school officials. In an interview with a news station, the student stated they had been bullied since elementary school for their sexuality and were treated unjustly by administration. Failure to take action against bullying was a commonality that many parents in the school district shared, and the news interview was spread around social media. Many were upset with the school district's lack of direct action. James Skoufis was in contact with superintendent Roberto Padilla, who claimed parts of the grand jury's report of findings were untrue. State education commissioner MaryEllen Elia was notified about the findings as well. As the school prepared to re-hire many of the coaches involved in the scandal for the 2019‚Äî2020 school year, they reconsidered. The district invested in a program, ScholarChip, to record attendance more efficiently. Athletics The NFA basketball team won the 2009 New York State Class AA Championship, as mentioned above. The NFA soccer team also won the 2009 New York State Class AA Championship. The NFA crew team's men's 4+ won the state regatta in 2008, and went on to compete in the national regatta winning 6th place, beating out all public schools in their category. The NFA football team has made the State Championship game twice, in 2011 and 2014, losing both games to Orchard Park and Jamestown, respectively. The NFA baseball team has not been to the state tournament since winning section 9 in 2005, however, they lost in extra innings to the eventual state champions, Kingston, in the section 9 semifinals in 2012. Newburgh is rivals with Monroe-Woodbury, Kingston, Middletown, and Pine Bush.

Jean de L√©ry (1536‚Äì1613) was an explorer, writer and Reformed pastor born in Lamargelle, C√¥te-d'Or, France. Scholars disagree about whether he was a member of the lesser nobility or merely a shoemaker. Either way, he was not a public figure prior to accompanying a small group of fellow Protestants to their new colony on an island in the Bay of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil from 1557 to 1558. There he produced the first known transcriptions of native American music: two chants of the Tupinamb√°, near Rio de Janeiro.. The colony, France Antarctique was founded by the Chevalier de Villegaignon, with promises of religious freedom, but on arrival, the Chevalier contested the Protestants' beliefs and persecuted them. After eight months the Protestants left their colony and survived for a short time on the mainland, living amongst the Tupinamba Indians. These events were the basis of de Lery's book, History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil, Also Called America (1578). Exhausted and starving, they then returned to France aboard a pirate ship. \\"Salutations larmoyantes\\" (\\"Tearful salutations\\"), in Histoire d'un voyage faict en la terre du Br√©sil (1578), Jean de L√©ry, 1580 edition. Throughout this book, L√©ry describes his voyage across the Atlantic to Brazil. On the way he encounters never before seen ocean wildlife that foreshadows many more discoveries to follow. While on the ship he and his men develop new skills of judging and navigating the winds, stars, currents, and tides. Upon arrival, L√©ry and his men are exposed to what seems to be an entirely new world. Throughout the body, the crew encounters a wide variety of people in an area not yet affected by European colonization. With the main goals set at Protestant Reformation, these men face many more challenges than expected, however make discoveries and encounter new things beyond their wildest dreams. L√©ry, Jean de. Translation and introduction by Janet Whatley (1990). \\"History of a Voyage to the Land of Brazil\\" University of California Press Ltd. p. xv- xvi. L√©ry witnessed the Tupinamba engage in war and cannibalize their enemies. On his return to France, de L√©ry married unhappily and became a Protestant minister. He endured and chronicled the Siege of Sancerre, remarking in his book, History of the City of Sancerre (1574) that his hardships in Brazil served him well, because he taught his fellow soldiers to make hammocks and eat anything, including shoe soles (though cannibalism still repelled him). During the siege of Sancerre, a Calvinist married couple and an old woman were caught boiling the couple's dead daughter in a cauldron for food. L√©ry devoted the tenth chapter of his account of the siege to describing and evaluating this episode of European Protestant cannibalism. Historian Adam Asher Duker has argued that L√©ry equated the residents of Sancerre with the cannibalistic Israelites of the Old Testament, and that he believed his own Huguenot community to be the worst of all cannibals, as they ate each other despite their highest understanding of the will of God.

They have been directing music videos and commercials since 1994. They have won numerous awards for their work, including the Gold Lion at the 1999 Cannes International Advertising Festival for their Nike What Are You Getting Ready For commercials and also won the MTV Best Video Award for The Chemical Brothers' \\"Believe\\".  Music video  After meeting at School in Oxfordshire dom&nic; began their directing career with a music video for \\"Mansize Rooster\\" by British band Supergrass (whose drummer Danny Goffey is Nic's younger brother). Parlophone's then video commissioner Dilly Gent introduced dom&nic; to music video production company Oil Factory, initially for the purposes of producing this one off video. Following the video's success Oil Factory began representing dom&nic; for music video work and it was here they met John Madsen their long term producer and third member of the team. They began making videos for a number of bands associated with the Brit Pop movement including The Bluetones, Sleeper and Lush. In July 1995 their video for Supergrass's Alright was released. Filmed in Portmeirion, Wales it was a tongue in cheek romp, mixing the band's British sense of humour with cult 1960s TV show influences such as The Monkees and The Prisoner. The video was parodied by Spitting Image, the satirical television comedy show, which placed Labour Party politicians Tony Blair, John Prescott and Margaret Beckett on Raleigh Chopper bikes with Prescot singing \\"shut my mouth...zip it tight...while e talks shite\\". The Alright video caught the attention of film director and producer Steven Spielberg who met with dom&nic; and Supergrass to discuss making a pilot for a TV show with the band. Supergrass subsequently decided they wanted to concentrate on songwriting and declined to go ahead with the project. They continued to work with Supergrass making a total of 13 videos over the band's career, receiving a Brit Award nomination in 1998 for Best Music Video for \\"Late in the Day\\". In 1996 they began another long standing working relationship with British electronic music duo The Chemical Brothers, making the video for Setting Sun the first single from their Dig Your Own Hole album. The track featured vocals from Noel Gallagher who was not available to appear in the video. Dom&nic;'s subsequent film was atypical of other dance music videos of the time. Taking the form of a narrative film which paid reverent attention to the music, it moved away from more abstract trends in the genre. The Setting Sun video \\"Spies rave culture's flip from underground to overground through the eyes of a bewildered teenage girl\\" as it follows her nightmarish out of body experience at an all night free party. It mixes unsettling psychological confusion with moments of humorous imagery, for example the terrified girl sees break dancing policemen. Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons played a cameo role as themselves leaving the party with their record cases. The cameo has become a tradition which continues in many of the Chemical Brothers' videos to date. Setting Sun received a number of award nominations including the MTV Breakthrough Video Award. When MTV announced a format shift away from alternative rock to electronica they cited the Setting Sun video as an inspiration. Dom&nic; continued the narrative format for The Chemical Brothers with follow up videos for Block Rockin' Beats (1997) (nominated for the Brit Awards Best Music Video and the MTV Awards Best Dance Video), Hey Boy Hey Girl (1999) and Come with Us/The Test featuring vocals from The Verve's Richard Ashcroft (2002). In 2006 their video for Believe (released 2005) a track featuring vocals by Bloc Party's Kele Okereke won Best Music Video in both MTV Europe's Awards and the CAD's Music video awards. In 2007 they worked with Framestore again to create a cast of singing and dancing fish for the Chemical Brothers single The Salmon Dance featuring Vocals by Pharcyde rapper Fatlip. The Salmon Dance was nominated for MTV Europe's 2007 Video Star Award (which replaced the previous years' Best Video category). Their most recent video for The Chemical Brothers is Midnight Madness. It was nominated for best Dance Video at the 2008 UK Music Video Awards. The directors have also collaborated twice with UK Dance music act Faithless making videos for \\"We Come 1\\" (2001) and \\"Mass Destruction\\" (2004). Other music video work includes Oasis's \\"D'You Know What I Mean?\\" (1997) nominated for Brit Awards Best Group Video, Smashing Pumpkins' \\"Ava Adore\\" (1998) nominated for MVPA Best Video Award and winning the MTV Fashion Award and David Bowie's \\"I'm Afraid of Americans\\" featuring Trent Reznor which won the MVPA Best Alternative Video Award and was nominated for MTV's Best Male Video Award 1997. They have also worked with the reinstated Take That singer Robbie Williams for his cover version of World Party's song \\"She's the One\\". The video won the Brit Awards for Best British Video 2000.  Advertising  In 1998 dom&nic; directed their first television commercials, Rehab and Restaurant for the Wieden+Kennedy What Are You Getting Ready For campaign for Nike. The campaign won a Gold lion at Cannes in the 1999 International Advertising Festival. The films were produced through Oil Factory Inc where dom&nic; were represented for US commercials. On returning to the UK the directors signed with Outsider Films for UK representation. They have since made commercials in both North America and Europe. In addition to their commercials work for large international clients they have also made films for a number of British charities including Barnardos, The Princes Trust and the housing charity Shelter.Their House of Cards film made for Shelter and advertising agency Leo Burnett was listed as the Joint Second most awarded commercial in the 2009 Gunn Report.

Conservatory Garden is a formal garden in the northeastern corner of Central Park near Museum Mile, Manhattan, New York City. It is located between 104th and 106th Streets west of Fifth Avenue. Comprising , it is the only formal garden in Central Park. Conservatory Garden takes its name from a conservatory that stood on the site from 1898 to 1935.  History  The park's head gardener, Ignatz Anton Pil√°t, originally stored plants at the site of Conservatory Garden during the construction of Central Park. At the time, park architects Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux wanted to landscape most of the northeast corner of Central Park as part of an arboretum, including the site of the current Conservatory Garden and Harlem Meer. However, this proposal was not implemented because of a lack of funds. Additionally, a formal conservatory had been planned for Conservatory Water, further south in Central Park, but was never built. A greenhouse on the site of Conservatory Garden was erected in 1898, and it contained exhibitions of plants and flower beds. Later, the glasshouses at the site were used to harden hardwood cuttings for the park's plantings. In 1935, NYC Parks commissioner Robert Moses destroyed the greenhouse since he believed it was obsolete. After the conservatory was torn down, the garden was designed by Gilmore D. Clarke, landscape architect for Moses, with planting plans by M. Betty Sprout.M. Betty Sprout, ASLA, (1906‚Äì1962), an accomplished landscape architect in her own right, was also Mrs Gilmore D. Clarke (National Register of Historic Places registration for Parkfairfax, Alexandria, Virginia), a Colonial Revival low-density housing development of 1941‚Äì43, by Leonard Schultze and Associates, architects, with a site plan developed by Gilmore Clarke, with planting plans by M. Betty Sprout. Constructed and planted by WPA workers, it was opened to the public in 1937. After World War II the garden had become neglected, and by the 1970s a wasteland. It was restored and partially replanted under the direction of horticulturist and urban landscape designer Lynden Miller and reopened in June 1987. The overgrown, top-heavy crabapples were freed of watershoots and pruned up to a higher scaffold for better form. The high-style mixed planting was the first to bring estate garden style to urban parks, part of the general renewal of Central Park under Elizabeth Barlow Rogers of the Central Park Conservancy.  Sections  The Garden is composed of three distinct parts, skillfully restored since the 1980s. It is accessible through the Vanderbilt Gate at Fifth Avenue and 105th Street, a quarter mile (400 m) south of the park's northeast corner. The Vanderbilt Gate once gave access to the forecourt of Cornelius Vanderbilt II's chateau designed by George Browne Post, the grandest of the Fifth Avenue mansions of the Gilded Age, at 58th Street and Fifth Avenue, sharing the Plaza with the Plaza Hotel. The wrought iron gates with cast iron and repouss√© details, were designed by Post and executed in an iron foundry in Paris. Below the steps flanked by Cornelian cherry (Cornus mas), the central section of the Conservatory Garden is a symmetrical lawn outlined in clipped yew,Designated \\"French\\" or \\"Italian\\" equally by journalists; in autumn 2006 the yews were replanted with more naturally spreading Taxus media ‚ÄòHatfieldii' cultivars that will make low formal shaping easier to maintain. with a single central fountain jet at the rear.

The shell has an oval aperture with a small notch or siphonal canal at the anterior end. The aperture has a smooth inner lip with a partial shield, and the outer lip is thin and smooth. The exterior of the shell is chalky white, but it is covered by a very dark brown, closely adhering periostracum, except in areas of the shell where the periostracum has been eroded. The apex of the shell is almost always eroded, and the shell is often quite damaged by the acidic properties of the mud in which the animal lives.

Algernon Charles Swinburne called Chapman's play All Fools one of the finest comedies in English. \\"The plot is intricate and ingenious and shows that Chapman had been taking lessons of Jonson's masters, Plautus and Terence.\\"Mina Kerr, The Influence of Ben Jonson on English Comedy, 1598‚Äì1642. New York, D. Appleton, 1912; p. 22. Performance An Humorous Day's Mirth was performed by the Admiral's Men at the Rose Theatre; it has been identified with the \\"Humours\\" play that the company acted on Thursday 11 May 1597, as described in a contemporary letter to Dudley Carleton from John Chamberlain. Philip Henslowe's diary, which covers performances at the Rose at this time, marks the play as 'ne' on this date while Chamberlain's comment that he had been drawn to the play by the 'common applause' suggests that he saw one of the five performances between 11 May and before the writing of the letter which is dated 11 June 1597. Chamberlain described the play as being 'in very great request' but his own impression of it differed. He draws on an agricultural colloquialism to inform Carleton that, in his opinion, '(as the fellow saide of the shearing of hogges), that there was a great crie for so litle wolle.' A 1598 inventory of the Admiral's properties lists items of clothing in the costumes of specific characters in the play.E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage. 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, p. 251. Publication The 1599 quarto, the only edition of the play in the seventeenth century, was printed and published by Valentine Simmes, who is generally recognized as one of the best London printers of his generation; Simmes printed nine Shakespeare quartos in the 1597‚Äì1604 period. The quality of Simmes's work is evident in the Chapman volume: \\"A shop proofreader was especially careful in correcting the first quarto edition....\\"Terence P. Logan and Denzell S. Smith, eds., The New Intellectuals: A Survey and Bibliography of Recent Studies in English Renaissance Drama, Lincoln, NE, University of Nebraska Press, 1977; p. 149. Text Yet if the printer did a good job of printing his text, the text he had to work with possessed significant deficiencies. \\"The text...is so corrupt, and the stage directions are so infrequent and confusing, that it is extremely difficult to follow the story.\\" The play was probably \\"altered and published without the author's supervision.\\"T. M. Parrott, in his Introduction to his edition of All Fools and The Gentleman Usher. Boston, D. C. Heath, 1907; p. xx. It is worth noting that in the first edition of a later Chapman comedy, All Fools (1605), the dedication indicates that Chapman oversaw the printing of that play, to prevent a version \\"patch'd with others' wit\\" from reaching the public. This has been taken to indicate that the printed versions of Chapman's earliest plays, The Blind Beggar of Alexandria and Humorous Day's Mirth, were corrupted and adulterated by other hands. Humours Chapman's play was the first Elizabethan humors comedy, drawing its material from the traditional theory of human physiology and psychology. The subgenre would gain its greatest prominence in the works of Ben Jonson ‚Äî most notably in Every Man in His Humour (1598) and Every Man Out of His Humour (1599), but through his later works too. Other dramatists of the era also worked in the humors vein, like John Fletcher in The Humorous Lieutenant (c. 1619) and James Shirley in The Humorous Courtier (1631). In the prevailing theory, the physically and emotionally healthy human being has his or her \\"humors\\" in a general balance; Chapman's comic characters illustrate various extremes of imbalance of humors. Dowsecer is melancholic and misanthropic; Dariotto is a fashion-obsessed courtier; Florilla is a Puritan wife whose Puritanism quickly fails the test; Cornelius is an upstart gentleman jealous of his wife. These and other characters show their vulnerability to folly by the end of the play. Chapman's protagonist Lemot acts as something like a circus ringmaster, presiding over the fun.

He began his aviation career during World War I as a fighter ace. Life and career A native of Bath, Maine, Sewall dropped out of Harvard College in 1917 to go to Europe to aid the Allies during World War I. Sewall served first in the American Ambulance Field Service from February through August 1917, then in the U.S. Army Signal Corps, then finally as a fighter pilot in the U.S. Army Air Service, becoming an ace by scoring seven victories. He enlisted in the USAAS in Paris, underwent training, and reported to the 95th Aero Squadron in February 1918. He was promoted to Flight Commander, and went on to score five victories over enemy planes between 3 June and 18 September 1918, sharing a couple of them with future general James Knowles and Edward Peck Curtis. Sewall then became a balloon buster, shooting down an observation balloon each on 4 and 5 November. The only victory he did not receive credit for came when German pilot Leutnant Heinz Freiherr von Beaulieu-Marconnay mistakenly landed on the 95th Aero Squadron's airfield, and Sewall and a couple of other American pilots captured him at gunpoint. Sewall returned home with the Distinguished Service Cross with oak leaf cluster, the French Legion of Honor, the Croix de guerre and the Order of the Crown of Belgium. After the war, he worked in a variety of jobs, including being an executive with Colonial Air Transport and a director of United Air Lines. His political career began when he became an alderman in Bath in 1933. He was elected to the Maine state legislature as a representative in 1934, then as a senator in 1936 and 1938. After the latter election, he was named President of the State Senate. In 1940, he was elected governor, and served two terms. Sewall's administration was notable for cleaning up scandals in state government and passing a minimum wage law for state teachers. After stepping down as governor, Sewall became president of American Overseas Airlines for a year, then served as the military governor of W√ºrttemberg-Baden from 1946 to 1947. In 1948, Sewall finished a distant third in the Republican primary for Maine's open United States Senate seat, which ended his political career. Sewall became president of the Bath National Bank in the 1960s. He died on 25 January 1965. Family Sewall's parents were William Dunning Sewall and Mary Locke Sumner of Shrewsbury, Massachusetts. Mary was the daughter of George Sumner and Sarah E. Richardson, and she was great-granddaughter of the Reverend Joseph Sumner of the First Congregational Church in Shrewsbury. William D. Sewall and Mary Locke Sumner lived at the Sewall Family Home in Bath, ME known as York Hall. Sewall's grandfather, Arthur Sewall, was the Democratic candidate for vice president in 1896.

He earned notoriety as the first (and thus far only) commanding officer to commit suicide while in active command of a naval vessel, as well as the only submariner to ever do so while underwater. History with U-505 U-505s first and very successful commander was Kapit√§nleutnant Axel L√∂we, who was relieved for illness in October 1942. L√∂we was replaced by Zschech, a veteran U-boat officer, who served for a year as watch officer in . Zschech was described as a \\"hard\\" commander, ambitious in his first command, indifferent to the morale of his men, and bad-tempered. On 11 November 1942, a month into her first war patrol under Zschech, U-505 was heavily damaged by air attack in the Caribbean Sea. The direct impact of a 250-lb bomb from a Lockheed Hudson on the foredeck tore the deck gun from the boat and severely breached the hull. Zschech ordered his men to abandon ship but his officers refused and managed to keep her afloat after a marathon two-week effort. She eventually limped back to Lorient on 12 December, earning the vessel the mixed honor of being the most heavily damaged U-boat to successfully return to port during the war. Repairs took six months. When Zschech again attempted to take U-505 to sea, repeated mechanical failures forced him to turn back for repairs after only a few days. This happened six consecutive times, usually due to sabotage by French dockyard workers in the Resistance, and caused U-505 to become the butt of numerous jokes for her combat ineffectiveness; while some U-boats were racking up impressive tonnage totals (and others were being sunk with all hands), U-505 had not even succeeded in leaving the Bay of Biscay in almost a year. The main joke about Zschech was, while many other U-boats were being sunk with all hands... \\"there is a captain who will always return home... Zschech\\" (due to the sabotages mentioned, such as defective welds). Suicide while in command On 10 October 1943, U-505 finally managed to leave successfully on patrol after six failed attempts. After only 14 days, she drew the attention of a pair of Allied destroyers while surfaced off the Azores and came under concentrated depth charge attack, a procedure all too common for U-boat crews by this point in the war. While riding out the depth charging, Zschech apparently suffered a severe mental breakdown and committed suicide by shooting himself in the head with a Walther PPK pistol in his control room, in full view of his shocked crew. His second-in-command, Oberleutnant zur See Paul Meyer, swiftly took command, rode out the remainder of the attack per standard procedure and returned the boat to port with light damage. Amazingly, he was not commended for his quick restoration of military discipline, but only \\"absolved of all blame\\" by the Kriegsmarine, who seemed to view U-505s troubles as proof of a generalized lack of discipline by her command crew, further harming whatever morale remained in the command staff of U-505. Zschech's suicide devastated the morale of U-505s crew. However, Grossadmiral Karl D√∂nitz did not dissolve and disperse the crew as many officers recommended (and most on U-505 had requested), fearing the effect on fleet morale if the story spread to other U-boats. It is generally accepted by historians that the terrible morale instilled in U-505s crew by the combined influence of these events led heavily to her being the only U-boat to be captured intact on the surface (instead of being scuttled as was standard procedure) when U-505 was attacked southwest of the Canary Islands on her next patrol; the crew reportedly panicked almost at once, with the new captain surfacing and abandoning ship before she was unseaworthy or even significantly damaged, leading to U-505s capture by the Allies, along with an intact Enigma machine, the month's Kriegsmarine codebook, and a variety of other secret documents. Perhaps most damaging of all, the Allies recovered U-505s G7es acoustic homing torpedoes, which were extensively reverse engineered to improve the Allied Foxer decoy system. An alternate account is provided by Hans Goebeler, a former crewman of U-505. In his memoir \\"Steel Boat, Iron Hearts: A U-boat Crewman's Life Aboard U-505\\" he states that the morale aboard U-505 was always high and that if anything, Zschech's suicide raised morale because few people liked him, and most loathed him. His book also recounts the events of the capture of U-505 describing how the submarine's rudder was jammed, and the auxiliary rudder control could not be reached because the rear compartment was flooded due to a breach from the depth charge attack. In addition, contrary to a \\"panicked\\" crew, he speaks only of the proficient and professional operation of the boat while it was under attack. Due to U-505s intact state the submarine was later preserved as a museum ship after being stripped of all intelligence value. She currently resides as an indoor exhibit at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, Illinois.

She was launched at Deptford Dockyard on 8 October 1778. During her career she was captured by the French, and later recaptured by the British. She fought at the Nile in 1798, and was broken up in 1819. She was named after Alexander the Great. British service and capture On 13 March 1780, Alexander and HMS Courageaux captured the 40-gun French privateer Monsieur after a long chase and some exchange of fire. The Royal Navy took the privateer into service as HMS Monsieur. In 1794, whilst returning to England in the company of HMS Canada after escorting a convoy to Spain, Alexander, under the command of Rear-Admiral Richard Rodney Bligh, fell in with a French squadron of five 74-gun ships, and three frigates, led by Joseph-Marie Nielly.Gossett (1986), p.6. In the Action of 6 November 1794 Alexander was overrun by the Droits de l'Homme, but escaped when she damaged the Droits de l'Hommes rigging. Alexander was then caught by Marat, which came behind her stern and raked her. Then, the 74 gun third-rate Jean Bart closed in and fired broadsides at close range, forcing Bligh to surrender Alexander. In the meantime, Canada escaped. The subsequent court martial honourably acquitted Bligh of any blame for the loss of his ship. The French took her to Brest and then into their French Navy under the name Alexandre. On 22 June 1795, she was with a French fleet off Belle √éle when the Channel Fleet under Lord Bridport discovered them. The British ships chased the French fleet, and brought them to action in the Battle of Groix. During the battle HMS Sans Pareil and HMS Colossus recaptured Alexander.

The squadron bore up for Sardinia, Alexander taking Vanguard in tow. The Alexander took part in the Battle of the Nile in 1798, under the command of Captain Alexander Ball. On the evening of 1 August 1798, half an hour before sunset, the battle began. She was the second ship to fire upon the French fleet, engaging the flagship, L'Orient.

Radio News was an American monthly technology magazine published from 1919 to 1971. The magazine was started by Hugo Gernsback as a magazine for amateur radio enthusiasts, but it evolved to cover all the technical aspects to radio and electronics. In 1929 a bankruptcy forced the sale of Gernsback's publishing company to B. A. Mackinnon. In 1938 Ziff-Davis Publishing acquired the magazines.  Gernsback Era  In 1904 Hugo Gernsback established Electro Importing Company to sell radio components and electrical supplies by mail order. The catalogs had detailed instructions on projects like a wireless telegraph outfit and were the predecessor of his first magazine, Modern Electrics (April 1908). In May 1913 he started another magazine, The Electrical Experimenter. The magazines would have Gernsback's bold predictions of the future as well as fiction. In 1926 he started the magazine Amazing Stories and coined the term \\"scientifiction\\" which became science fiction. Gernsback was an enthusiastic supporter of amateur radio. During the First World War the US government placed a ban on amateur radio and Gernsback led the campaign to lift it. Gernsback started a magazine devoted to radio, Radio Amateur News (July 1919.) The title was shortened to Radio News in July 1920.  Bankruptcy  November 1930 issue of Radio News These magazines were published by The Experimenter Publishing Company Inc. and would prominently show \\"Edited by HUGO GERNSBACK\\" (or \\"Edited by H. GERNSBACK\\") on the cover. Hugo and his brother Sydney had a booming empire. In addition to Experimenter Publishing, they had two radio stations and published books. They would use the money from newsstand sales to pay the printers for last month's magazine. On February 20, 1929 an involuntary petition of bankruptcy was filed against Experimenter Publishing and the April 1929 issue of Radio News was the last to feature Hugo Gernsback as editor. Gernsback quickly raised the capital for a new publishing company. He created new set of magazines to compete with his previous ones. Radio-Craft was competing with Radio News by the July 1929 issue. Radio News new publisher was B. A. MacKinnon and the new company was Experimenter Publications which became Radio-Science Publications in June 1930. \\"Experiments [sic] Publications to Radio Science Publications\\" Arthur H. Lynch dropped the forecasting of things to come and provided the technical information to design, service, and operate radio equipment. The cover art changed from people in dramatic or humorous scenes to a solid red cover showing a single component or piece of equipment. Radio-Science Publications ceased operations with the August 1931 issues. Bernarr Macfadden's newly formed Teck Publishing Corporation took over with the September 1931 issue. \\"Teck Publishing Corp. J Schultz. 522 5th Av. $10,000\\" Joseph Schultz was the attorney for Macfadden Publications, Inc. Laurence Cockaday became the editor; the format remained the same but the advances in radio and television broadened the topics covered. A common item in all radio magazines was a list of broadcast stations and short wave stations. In 1934 the covers had black-and-white photos. Color illustrations returned in 1936. A sister magazine, Television News was published in 1931-1932.Television News American Radio History  Ziff-Davis Publishing  The Radio News and Amazing Stories were acquired by Ziff-Davis Publishing in January 1938. Ziff-Davis Publishing Company, New York and Chicago, has purchased Radio News Magazine and Amazing Stories. Ziff-Davis Publishing Company, publisher of Radio News, has bought All Wave Radio and will combine the two publications with the August issue. The March issue was prepared by the Teck Publishing staff but Ziff-Davis was listed as the publisher. The magazine was down to 64 pages. The April 1938 issue was the first produced by Ziff-Davis. The cover has a full color picture of Lucille Ball and an additional 20 pages of gossip and radio star coverage. The articles were to broaden the readership to more than engineers and repair men. (Almost all of the readers were male.) The radio star covers lasted only a few months. William B. Ziff, Sr., the majority owner, was the publisher and Bernard G. Davis was the Editor. In the mid-1940s Davis became the General Manager and Oliver Read was the editor. The great advances in electronics during World War II were finally available to consumers and industry in the late 1940s. These included television, FM radio, tape recording, Hi-Fi audio. Industry saw advanced test equipment, early computers, and improved communication systems. The two leading technical radio magazines changed their names to reflect this. In 1948 Radio-Craft became Radio-Electronics and Radio News became Radio & Television News (August 1948). It was shortened to Radio & TV News in May 1957. Both magazines had covered similar topics but Radio- Electronics emphasized repair and service while Radio & Television News emphasized design and engineering. William Ziff Sr. died of a heart attack in December 1953. His 23-year-old son, William B. Ziff, Jr., was a philosophy student at the University of Heidelberg but he immersed himself into the magazine business. In 1957, William Ziff, Jr. bought out Davis' minority share. Bernard G. Davis and his son, Joel, formed Davis Publications in August 1957. \\"The acquisition of Mercury Publications, Inc., and the Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine has been disclosed by Bernard G. Davis. He had resigned last month as president of the Ziff-Davis Publishing Company. Control of the Corporation was purchased from Joseph W. Furman.\\" They acquired Mercury Publications, Inc which published Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine and Science & Mechanics Publishing which published Radio-TV Experimenter magazine. Science & Mechanics magazine was started by Hugo Gernsback in 1929 and stayed in print until 1972.  Electronics World  Radio News became Electronics World in 1959. Ziff-Davis Publishing would develop two categories of magazines; the professional magazine such as Radio & Television News and the leisure time magazines like Popular Photography. In October 1954, Popular Electronics was created for the hobbyist market. It became the largest selling electronics magazine, 250,000 copies per month by 1957 and 450,000 copies by 1965. Initially Oliver Read was the editor of both Radio & Television News and Popular Electronics. Soon Oliver P. Ferrell took over as editor of Popular Electronics and Wm. A. Stocklin as editor of Radio & Television News. The title Radio & TV News was changed Electronics World in May 1959 to reflect the expanding field of electronics. The feature stories were often on the newest technology and at a sophisticated level. Some examples: \\"Melting Silicon for Semiconductors\\" (May 1959), \\"Computer Arithmetic Circuits\\" (June 1961), and \\"Binary Computer Codes and ASCII\\" (July 1964.) There were also articles on audio and video consumer electronics, communications systems, automotive and industrial electronics. In 1960, most of the consumer audio, radio and television devices used vacuum tubes. These sets required frequent repair so there was a Radio/TV repair shop in every neighborhood. Electronics World had a section devoted to repair and John T. Frye wrote a monthly column, \\"Mac's Service Shop\\". A large portion of the advertisements were directed at the service industry. The April 1963 issue has a 6 page article, \\"Electronics in Banking\\", that explains in detail how the magnetic numbers on the bottom of checks would be read into computers. It also has the first article written by Don Lancaster, \\"Solid-State 3-Channel Color Organ\\".  Popular Electronics  Electronics World merges with Popular Electronics in 1972. By 1970 the experimenter articles in Popular Electronics were at the same level as the articles in Electronics World. Popular Electronics had over twice the readership so in January 1972 Electronics World was merged with Popular Electronics. The changes in the editorial staff during this time induced many of their authors to start writing for their competitor, Radio-Electronics. In September 1973 Radio Electronics published Don Lancaster's TV Typewriter, a low cost video display. In July 1974 Radio Electronics published the Mark-8 Personal Minicomputer based on the Intel 8008 processor. The editors of Popular Electronics needed a computer project so they selected Ed Robert's Altair 8800 computer based on the improved Intel 8080 processor. The January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics had the Altair computer on the cover.

Gieben, 1989), p. 142 Leunissen is one of many scholars who suggest that a headless and fragmentary inscription recovered in El Kef in Tunisia provides details of Repentinus' cursus honorum. (This identification has been questioned in a recent article by Werner Eck.Eck, \\"Eine Laufbahninschrift aus Sicca Veneria und die Stadtpr√§fektur des Cornelius Repentinus\\", Voce concordi. Scritti per Claudio Zaccaria, ed. Fulvia Mainardis (Trieste, 2017), pp. 271-278) Leunissen argues that this inscription not only confirms that Repentinus was consul and urban prefect, but that during the co- reigns of Marcus Aurelius and Commodus Repentinus was curator of the Via Flaminia (which would be between 117 and 180), then after an unknown appointment (possibly commander of a legion) he served as governor of the imperial province of Lusitania. Leunissen dates the tenure of this governor, regardless of his identity with Repentinus, possibly from 185 to 188.Leunissen, Konsuln und Konsulare, p. 290 In the first months of 193, Repentinus married the daughter of Didius Julianus, Didia Clara. When the emperor Pertinax was murdered on 28 March, according to the Historia Augusta, Julianus and Repentinus were outside the senate house where they had been summoned, finding the doors were locked. Two tribunes informed the pair that Titus Flavius Claudius Sulpicianus was at the camp of the Praetorian Guard seeking their support to become emperor; Repentinus was one of a group who encouraged Julianus to compete for the purple, and the tribunes led them to the camp where Julianus outbid Sulpicianus and became emperor. One of his first acts was to appoint Repentinus urban prefect.Historia Augusta, \\"Didius Julianus\\", 2.4-3.6 Despite that Julianus was never secure on the throne, Repentinus remained a firm supporter of his father-in-law his entire reign; reportedly he and the praetorian prefect Titus Flavius Genialis were the only two with Julianus at the end.Historia Augusta, \\"Didius Julianus\\", 8.6 The fate of Cornelius Repentinus and his wife after the death of his father-in-law are unknown.

It extends from SR 7 in the census-designated place (CDP) of Elbe east to the Longmire gate of Mount Rainier National Park. The highway was part of the Tacoma - Mount Rainier branch of Primary State Highway 5 (PSH 5 TR) from 1937 until 1964 and ran from Tacoma south to Elbe and east to Longmire. In 1964, PSH 5 TR from Tacoma to Elbe became part of SR 7 and the Elbe to Mount Rainier section became SR 706\\\\. Route description SR 706 runs from an intersection with SR 7 in the census-designated place (CDP) of Elbe, east to end at the Longmire gate of Mount Rainier National Park (Mount Rainier NP). The route serves as a connector from Elbe to Mount Rainier NP. The highway is open all-year and the entrance to Mount Rainier National Park is open all-year round, unlike other entrances that are open only in the summer. WSDOT has found that more than 3,100 motorists utilize the road daily after the interchange with I-5 based on annual average daily traffic (AADT) data. SR 706 starts at an intersection with SR 7 in Elbe. After the junction, the road goes northeast, paralleling a railroad owned by Tacoma Rail. The railroad extends south to Morton and north to Tacoma. The highway then turns southeast to Park Junction. After passing Park Junction, SR 706 turns due east to National, where the railroad ends. From National, the road turns northeast and curves southeast into Ashford. In Ashford, the highway returns going due east before starting to curve and then end at the entrance to Mount Rainier National Park. The road continues east to the Henry M. Jackson Visitor Center. History PSH 5 TR. When the Primary and Secondary Highways were created in 1937, the route of SR 706 became part of the Tacoma - Mount Rainier branch of Primary State Highway 5 (PSH 5 TR). PSH 5 TR ran from Primary State Highway 1 (PSH 1) in Tacoma south to Elbe and east to Longmire. PSH 5 TR became SR 706 in 1964 during the 1964 highway renumbering, in which the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) replaced the previous system of Primary and Secondary Highways with a new system called State Routes, which is still in use today. In 1990, the Washington State Legislature named the highway the Road to Paradise, to recognize the community of Paradise and the Paradise Inn.

The highway begins at SR 7 southwest of Eatonville and travels north as Meridian Avenue to Puyallup, becoming concurrent with SR 512 and SR 167\\\\. SR 161 continues northwest as the Enchanted Parkway to end at an intersection with SR 18 in Federal Way, west of Interstate 5 (I-5). The highway serves the communities of Graham and South Hill before reaching Puyallup and the communities of Edgewood, Milton, and Lakeland South before reaching Federal Way. SR 161 was established during the 1964 highway renumbering, replacing three Secondary State Highways (SSHs): Secondary State Highway 5D (SSH 5D) and SSH 5G, both established in 1937, and SSH 5N, established in 1955. SSH 5D served as a connector between Federal Way and Puyallup and SSH 5G served as a connector between Puyallup and South Hill. SSH 5N connected Eatonville to South Hill and was extended south towards La Grande in 1967. SR 161 was moved onto a bypass of Puyallup in the 1980s and formed concurrencies with SR 167 and SR 512 as a result. , projects to expand the highway in Edgewood and Milton and adding new offramps at the I-5 and SR 18 interchange are in progress. Route description SR 161 begins southwest of Eatonville and north of La Grande in rural Pierce County at an intersection with SR 7\\\\. The highway travels northeast to pass the Charles Lathrop Pack Experimental and Demonstration Forest and cross the Little Mashel River into Eatonville. The roadway crosses the Mashel River into Downtown Eatonville, turning north onto Mashell Avenue and later Washington Avenue. SR 161 turns west onto Meridian Avenue north of Eatonville High School and leaves the city on a two-lane highway. Meridian Avenue, named for a meridian parallel to the Willamette Meridian, continues north through rural Pierce County, passing Clear Lake and Tanwax Lake, before entering the community of Graham and crossing a Tacoma Rail line near Graham-Kapowsin High School. SR 161 travels north and passes South Hill and Pierce County Airport (Thun Field) before entering Puyallup. The highway turns northwest at the South Hill Mall onto 31st Avenue and intersects the SR 512 freeway in a partial cloverleaf interchange, beginning a concurrency. SR 161 and SR 512 travel north on a freeway in Puyallup, intersecting Meridian Street at the Puyallup Fairgrounds and Pioneer Avenue at a partial cloverleaf interchange. After the intersection with Pioneer Avenue, the freeway travels over a BNSF rail line that serves Puyallup station and crosses the Puyallup River before a trumpet interchange with SR 167. At the interchange, SR 512 ends and SR 161 northbound turns west on a wrong-way concurrency with SR 167, designated as traveling southbound. SR 161 turns north onto Meridian Avenue at Fort Malone as SR 167 travels south into Downtown Puyallup, and the highway continues north and crosses a Union Pacific rail line. Meridian Avenue continues north to form the boundary between Edgewood and Milton, where the highway intersects Milton Way, the former route of SR 514. SR 161 turns northwest into King County as the Enchanted Parkway, passing through Lakeland South and Wild Waves Theme Park before crossing over I-5. The Enchanted Parkway turns north into Federal Way and ends at an intersection with SR 18, located between SR 99 and I-5. Every year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that between 340 and 99,000 vehicles per day used the highway, mostly in the Puyallup area. History SR 161 was formed during the 1964 highway renumbering as the successor to SSH 5N from Primary State Highway 5 (PSH 5) north of La Grande to South Hill, SSH 5G from South Hill to U.S. Route 410 (US 410) in Puyallup, and SSH 5D from US 410 north of Puyallup to US 99 Federal Way. The highway was also concurrent with US 410, signed in 1926, between the eastern end of SSH 5G in Downtown Puyallup and the southern end of SSH 5D. SSH 5D and SSH 5G were established during the creation of the Primary and secondary state highways in 1937, and SSH 5N was established in 1955 to Eatonville and extended south to PSH 5 near La Grande in 1967 after SR 161 was created. SR 161, including the concurrency with US 410, was signed into law in 1970 as a highway extending from SR 7 near Eatonville to US 99. US 410 was replaced with an extension of SR 167 in the Tacoma area and US 12 east of the Cascade Mountains in 1967 and the highway was shortened from US 99 to SR 18 in 1971. SR 161 was moved east onto a bypass of Puyallup, creating concurrences with SR 512 and SR 167, in the late 1980s, and designated, within King County, as the Enchanted Parkway in 1987 as the last major revision to the highway. A freeway extension to SR 167 between Tacoma and Puyallup has been proposed since the 1990s and would create a new interchange with SR 161 north of the Puyallup River, but the freeway has not been built. The eastbound ramps at end of the concurrency between SR 161 and SR 167 was realigned in late 2008 to reduce congestion and started recent improvements to the highway. WSDOT is widening the Enchanted Parkway through the Edgewood and Milton area from 2 lanes to 4 lanes with wider shoulders and sidewalks to be completed by 2027. The interchange between I-5 and SR 18 was reconstructed with a new flyover ramp from westbound SR 18 to SR 161 that was completed in July 2012. Another ramp, from southbound I-5 to SR 161, was opened months later and is planned to be replaced with a ramp to South 356th Street that feeds into a roundabout with SR 161. The ramp had been proposed since the 1990s.

The Indians traveled back with their hostages to a Shawnee village in Kentucky. One of the captives, Mary Draper Ingles later escaped and returned home on foot through the wilderness. Although many of the actual circumstances of the incident are uncertain, including the date of the attack, the event remains a dramatic story in the history of Virginia. Location The original 7,500 acre (30 km¬≤) tract that became known as Draper's Meadow was awarded sometime before 1737 by Governor Robert Dinwiddie to Colonel James Patton, an Irish sea captain turned land speculator. This land was bordered by Tom's Creek on the north, Stroubles Creek on the south and the Mississippi watershed (modern-day U.S. Route 460) on the east; it approached the New River on the west. The settlement was situated on the present day campus of Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia. At the time of the attack, the area had been populated by a group of around twenty settlers who were a mix of migrants from Pennsylvania of English and Germanic origin. A marker commemorating the massacre is located near the Duck Pond on the Virginia Tech campus. The Massacre Rising tensions between the natives and western settlers were exacerbated by fighting in the French and Indian War and the encroachment on tribal hunting grounds. Recent victories by the French over the British, although north of Virginia, had left much of the frontier unprotected. In the summer of 1755 several settlements had been ravaged by the Indians. On July 9 a force of about 1300 British soldiers under the command of General Edward Braddock had been decisively defeated by French troops and Shawnees at the Battle of the Monongahela, which encouraged further violence against settlers in the region. On July 30 (see disagreement of sources about the date below) a group of Shawnee (then allies of the French) entered the sparsely populated camp virtually unimpeded and killed at least five people and wounded at least one person and burned the settlement.\\"A Register of the Persons Who Have Been Either Killed, Wounded, or Taken Prisoners by the Enemy, in Augusta County, as also such as Have Made Their Escape,\\" in The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, Vol. II, June 1895, published by the Virginia Historical Society, Richmond, Virginia. Among the victims were Colonel James Patton, Caspar Barger, and two people in Mary Draper Ingles' family: her mother (Elenor Draper), and the baby of her sister-in-law Bettie Robertson Draper, who (the baby) was killed by dashing its head against the wall of a cabin. Other children in the settlement may have been killed in a similar way. William Cecil Pendleton, History of Tazewell County and Southwest Virginia: 1748-1920, W. C. Hill printing Company, 1920, p. 270. Colonel William Preston (Colonel Patton's nephew) and John Draper (Bettie Draper's husband, Mary's brother) were not at the settlement at the time of the attack, as they were working in the fields, and survived. William Ingles (Mary's husband) was attacked and nearly killed but managed to flee into the forest.Transcript of John Ingles' manuscript \\"The Narrative of Col. John Ingles Relating to Mary Ingles and the Escape from Big Bone Lick,\\" 1824. One of the victims, Caspar Barger, was described as an old man and was decapitated by the Indians; they delivered his head in a bag to a neighbor, explaining that an acquaintance had arrived to visit. Five (or possibly six) settlers were captured and taken back to Kentucky as captives to live among the tribe, including Mary Draper Ingles and her two sons, Thomas, age 4, and George, age 2, and Mary's neighbor Henry Lenard (also spelled Leonard). In mid-October Mary escaped at Big Bone, Kentucky, without her children, and made a journey of more than across the Appalachian Mountains back to Draper's Meadow.James Duvall, \\"Mary Ingles and the Escape from Big Bone Lick,\\" Boone County Public Library, 2009. Some sources state that Mary was pregnant when captured and gave birth to her daughter in captivity, and that she abandoned her baby when she decided to escape,Letitia Preston Floyd, ‚ÄúMemoirs of Letitia Preston Floyd, written Feb. 22, 1843 to her son Benjamin Rush Floyd.\\"John Peter Hale, Trans-Allegheny Pioneers: Historical Sketches of the First White Settlements West of the Alleghenies, 1886.Thomas D. Davis, \\"Pioneer physicians of Western Pennsylvania: the president's address of the Medical Society of the State of Pennsylvania\\" Pennsylvania, 1901; pp. 20-21. however there is evidence to the contrary. The Aftermath In the aftermath, Draper's Meadow was abandoned, as was much of the frontier for the duration of the French and Indian War. William Preston, who had been in Draper's Meadow on the morning of the attack but left on an errand and so was saved, eventually obtained the property, which became Smithfield Plantation and later Blacksburg. Out of the surviving family members, only the Bargers returned later to reclaim their land and settle. Survivors relocated in 1787 to Blockhouse Bottom near what is now East Point, Kentucky. After her escape, Mary Draper Ingles reunited with her husband and resumed farming at Dunkert Bottom until the following spring. Concerned about continued Shawnee raids on neighboring settlements, they moved to Fort Vause, where a small garrison safeguarded the residents. Mary remained uneasy, however, and persuaded her husband to move again, this time to Bedford County, Virginia.Lewis Preston Summers, History of Southwest Virginia, 1746-1786, Washington County, 1777-1870, J.L. Hill Print. Company, 1903. In 1762 they established Ingles Ferry across the New River, along with a tavern and a blacksmith shop. Mary died there in 1815. Mary's sister-in-law Bettie Robertson Draper was found and ransomed by her husband John Draper in 1761 after six years in captivity. Mary's son Thomas was ransomed and returned to Virginia in 1768 at the age of 17.Luther F. Addington, \\"Captivity of Mary Draper Ingles,\\" Historical \\"Sketches of Southwest Virginia, Southwest Virginia Historical Society, Publication No 2, 1967. One source states that another captive, Mary's neighbor Henry Leonard, later escaped, although no details are given.Lyman Chalkley, Chronicles of the Scotch-Irish Settlement in Virginia: Extracted from the Original Court Records of Augusta County, 1745-1800, Volume 2. Augusta County (Va.): The Commonwealth Printing Company, 2010; p. 510. Mary's two-year-old son George was taken from her and is believed to have died in captivity. Historical accuracy Except for a few scattered references to these events in contemporary reports and letters, the primary sources are: :1) the 1824 written account by Colonel John Ingles (son of Mary Ingles and William Ingles, born in 1766 after Mary's return); :2) parts of an 1843 letter by Letitia Preston Floyd (wife of Virginia Governor John Floyd and daughter of Colonel William Preston, a survivor of the Draper's Meadow massacre). There are some differences in the two narratives, suggesting that the Ingles and Preston families had developed distinct oral traditions. The disagreements between these original written sources include the date of the massacre (July 30 vs July 8, according to Ingles and Floyd, respectively), the number of casualties, the age of Mary Ingles' children, and several other aspects. John Peter Hale (1824-1902), one of Mary Ingles‚Äô great-grandsons, claimed to have interviewed Letitia Floyd and others who knew Mary Ingles personally, and his 1886 narrative contains numerous details not cited in any previous account. Popular culture The story of Mary Draper Ingles' escape and journey home has inspired a number of books, films, and living history programs, including the popular 1981 novel Follow the River by James Alexander Thom, a 1995 ABC television movie Follow the River (TV movie), and the 2004 film The Captives. There is an acclaimed outdoor drama performed each summer in Radford, Virginia entitled, \\"Walk To Freedom: The Mary Draper Ingles Story,\\" which details the events during the attack at Drapers Meadows and Mary Draper Ingles' heroic trek through the wilderness to reach her home in the New River Valley.

It is named after an annual outing to Ringsend, near Dublin city, by Dublin cobblers (waxies). It originated as a 19th-century children's song and is now a popular pub song in Ireland.  Origin of ‚ÄúThe Waxies‚Äô Dargle‚Äù  The Dargle In the 19th century, during the Summer, the gentry of Dublin would travel out to Bray and Enniskerry with their entourages and have picnics on the banks of the River Dargle. The Dargle was a popular holiday resort, and the name in Dublin slang became synonymous with \\"holiday resort\\". The shoe-makers and repairers in Dublin were known as waxies, because they used wax to waterproof and preserve the thread they used in stitching the shoes.Bernard Share: Slanguage, A Dictionary of Irish Slang. Dublin, Gill and McMillan (1997 and 2005) Easter and Whitsun were their principal holidays, Monday being the excursion for men and Tuesday for women. The original Waxies' Dargle was said to be part of Donnybrook Fair, but because of riotous behaviour this fair closed in 1855. In any case, the waxies' excursions did not go all the way to Bray, but only went as far as Irishtown which is located between Ringsend and Sandymount. In imitation of the gentry, they called their outing the Waxies' Dargle. They drove out from the city to Ringsend on flat drays, ten or a dozen to each vehicle. It cost two pence per car-load and the usual cry of the driver was \\"Tuppence, an' up with yeh!\\". Those who wanted a more comfortable ride could take a jaunting car from D'Olier Street for threepence. Their destination was a favourite resort for Dubliners, a grass-covered triangle near the sea-front at Irishtown. On Summer evenings fiddlers, flautists and melodeon-players played dance music (sets, half-sets and reels) until midnight. There was a roaring trade in porter, cockles and mussels and \\"treacle Billy\\". On Bank holidays there were boxing contests. There is an engraved stone, marking the location of the Waxies' Dargle \\"picnic\\" site near Gleesons Pub in Irishtown. Robert Gogan50 Great Irish Drinking Songs, Music Ireland, 2005 describes how the \\"Waxies' Dargle\\" focuses on working-class Dublin. The places referenced are in areas frequented by the poor. Monto was an area around Montgomery Street, a notorious red-light district near the centre of Dublin. Capel Street is on the north side of the city and was renowned for its pawnbroking shops, a few of which remain to this day. The Waxies' Dargle is also mentioned in another Dublin folk song, \\"Monto (Take Her Up to Monto)\\", written by George Desmond Hodnett. The Waxies' Dargle is referenced in the Aeolus episode of the novel Ulysses by James Joyce. The character Myles Crawford refers to the two old ladies on top of Nelson's pillar as being \\"Out for the waxies' Dargle\\". The air The air to which the song is sung is that of \\"Brighton Camp\\" (a reel in G Major), which is also used for \\"The Girl I Left Behind\\" and \\"The Rare Old Mountain Dew\\". The earliest known version of the melody was printed about 1810 in Hime's Pocket Book for the German Flute or Violin (Dublin), vol. 3, p. 67, under the title The Girl I left Behind Me (in the National Library of Ireland, Dublin).James J.

The launch of the craft in April 1967 was cancelled due to thunderstorms, likely saving the three-person crew from the same design problems that killed the one-person crew of Soyuz 1. In the Soviet space program it was usual only for successful launches to gain official designations, so this mission did not receive an official designation and is informally named Soyuz 2A to distinguish it from the later official Soyuz 2 mission, which was launched in October 1968 as an unmanned docking target for Soyuz 3. Background Over two years had passed since the previous manned Soviet space flight. To introduce the new Soyuz spacecraft, the Soviets planned an ambitious double mission, which would see the two spacecraft dock and exchange passengers. This was despite the failure of unmanned tests of the Soyuz spacecraft, which still contained flaws. Political pressure from the Soviet leadership meant the launch of Soyuz 1 went ahead in spite of these problems. Crew As with the Voshkod flights, the crew came from different departments, commanded by director of cosmonaut training Nikolai Kamanin, and Vasily Mishin, director of the design engineering department OKB-1. Since 1965, Kamanin had eight cosmonauts in training for Soyuz missions. Four had already been in space: Yuri Gagarin, Andriyan Nikolayev, Valery Bykovsky, and Vladimir Komarov. Viktor Gorbatko and Yevgeny Khrunov had been with the program since 1960, and Anatoli Voronov and Pyotr Kolodin had been with the program since 1963, but none had flown into space. Mishin decided to train suitable engineers in his own department as cosmonauts and then nominate them for Soyuz crews. In May 1966 Sergei Anokhin, Aleksei Yeliseyev, and Valeri Kubasov, along with five additional engineers, where added to the group of cosmonauts. A further candidate for mission commander was Georgi Beregovoi, who became a cosmonaut in 1964 due to the promotion of Marshal Rudenko into the group of cosmonauts. Furthermore, Beregovoi was an excellent test pilot, however, he was larger and heavier than the other cosmonauts and he also exceeded the maximum age. The crew assignments were frequently changed. Poor organization also played a role, for in the case of Anokhin there was no spacesuit available for him. In August 1966 it was decided that Soyuz 1 and Soyuz 2 would be commanded by Komarov and Bykovsky respectively, with Gagarin and Nikolayev as their backups. Two additional crew members would be selected from Anokhin, Yeliseyev, Khrunov, and Gorbatko. This decision was not final, however. The decision regarding the crew escalated to the Central Committee, and in November they issued a dispatch stating that Soyuz 1 should be flown by Komorov, with Gagarin as backup. Soyuz 2 should be commanded by Bykovsky with Nikolayev as backup. Therefore, Beregovoi would not have a space flight until Soyuz 3. As for the two cosmonauts who would transfer after docking from Soyuz 2 to Soyuz 1, Khrunov and Yeliseyev where selected, with Gorbatko and Kubasov as their backups. That meant three of the four spots were taken by experienced cosmonauts, while the fourth was taken by an engineer, and Khrunov had already served as a backup for Alexei Leonov during the Voskhod 2 mission. Soyuz 1 problems Soyuz 1, with Komarov on board, was launched on 23 April 1967. Soyuz 2 was to be launched the following day, with both spacecraft spending four days in orbit. Serious problems soon arose with Soyuz 1, however, particularly the failure of a solar panel to deploy, which caused the spacecraft's systems to become unstable. It was believed that the cosmonauts from Soyuz 2 could solve the Soyuz 1 solar panel problem via an EVA. However, the Soyuz 2 launch could not proceed due to thunderstorms at the launchpad which affected the booster‚Äôs electrical system. The Soyuz 1 mission was then aborted and Komarov was able to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere. However both parachutes and the retro-rockets failed, and Komarov was killed on impact. During the course of investigations afterward, it was determined that Soyuz 2 had the same parachute issues as Soyuz 1, and if it had been launched, Bykovsky, Khrunov, and Yeliseyev presumably would have been killed as well. Effects The Soyuz 1 disaster set the Soviet space program back 18 months. It was not until October 1968 that the next manned Soyuz mission was launched, flown by Beregovoi. Khrunov and Yeliseyev eventually flew on Soyuz 5, which along with Soyuz 4 achieved the objectives of their Soyuz 2 flight in January 1969. Meanwhile, Bykovsky prepared for a planned manned moon flight, which was never launched.

Early life Ahmad Tohari was born in the village of Tinggarjaya, Jatilawang, Banyumas, the fourth of twelve children. Although Tohari's parents were both from farming backgrounds, his father had received an education and, while employed as director of the regional office for the Ministry of Religious Affairs, was responsible for the establishment of the pesantren in Tinggarjaya. Tohari's father has been described as a \\"progressive intellectual\\" and under his guidance Tohari developed a deep understanding of Indonesian politics and a strong sense of social and environmental responsibility. Tohari has described himself as a mischievous child who often visited a neighboring abangan village (i.e., one that practices a less orthodox version of the Islamic faith). This experience, plus his mother's tolerance, gave Tohari the opportunity to experience lifestyles different to his own. His mother maintained good relations with a ronggeng dancer from a neighboring village, and it was this that later provided Tohari with the background for the Ronggeng Dukuh Paruk trilogy. Although Tohari's education in the pesantren developed by his parents left him with deep religious convictions, as an adult his progressive interpretation of Indonesian Islam has been criticized by some as being out of step with the status quo. Tohari has described himself as a \\"progressive religious intellectual\\" whose aim is to nurture a modern Islam that honors Indonesia's diverse indigenous culture and traditions while following the teaching of the Koran. Tohari's formal education ended with high school in Purwokerto. He explored several faculties of economics, social and political studies and medicine, but did not graduate from any of them. Tohari didn't initially plan to become a novelist, preferring instead to study medicine at the school of medicine of the Jakarta Islamic Hospital Foundation, but was forced to leave for economic reasons. Career Tohari moved to Jakarta in the early 1970s and worked briefly Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI) (1970‚Äì72), was editor of the newspaper Harian Merdeka (1979-1981) and editor of the magazine Amanah (1986 - 1993). He began writing short stories, poems and essays in the early 1970s while working for the BNI. Initial recognition came in 1975 when he was named favorite short story writer in a Dutch Radio Hilversum contest. Further success came in 1978 when his novel, Di Kaki Bukit Cibalak (On the Foothill of Cibalak), won a novel writing contest organized by the Jakarta Arts Council. In 1980, he published his novel, Kubah (Dome). This was followed in 1981 with publication of the first book of Tohari's famous trilogy, Ronggeng Dukuh Paruk, in series in the publication Kompas daily. The second and third books, Lintang Kemukus Dini Hari (A Shooting Star at Dawn) and Jentera Bianglala (The Rainbow's Arc), were published in 1985 and 1986 respectively. The trilogy and Kubah discussed in some detail the fate of those accused of collaborating with the Communist Party after the 30 September Movement. This did affect publication. Although the trilogy was serialized in Kompas, several sections of the final in the trilogy, Jentera Bianglala, had to be rewritten as the daily feared publishing them in their original form. The complete trilogy was later published with the previously removed sections restored. Having spent most of the 1970s and 1980s working in Jakarta, Tohari decided to return to his village because he felt he did not belong in the city. In interviews, Tohari has explained how his ideas for books, including Ronggeng Dukuh Paruk, have often been inspired by things around his home village. Tohari still lives in the Banyumas area and his experience of growing up in a small village continues to color his literary works. Tohari is married with five children. Tohari is a prolific writer. Besides the aforementioned works he has published a number of works, including eleven novels, three anthologies of political and religious essays, two collection of short stories, and numerous individual short stories and essays. Notable works include Bekisar Merah, Belantik, Mas Mantri Gugat, Lingkar Tanah Lingkar Air. Many of the short stories that were originally published in newspapers and magazines have been collected into the compilations Senyum Karyamin and Nyanyian Malam. He is one of only a few Indonesian writers who have written stories set against the background of the Indonesian killings of 1965-66. His books have been published in Japanese, Chinese, Dutch and German. An English edition of Ronggeng Dukuh Paruk was published in 2003 by the Lontar Foundation in Jakarta. In 2011, the second film version of Tohari's novel Sang Penari (The Dancer), produced by Shanty Harman and directed by Ifa Isfansyah, was screened in Jakarta. Tohari has voiced his approval of this latest screen version of his work, having previously expressed his disappointment in the 1983 version, Darah dan Mahkota Ronggeng (Blood and Crown of the Dancing Girl), made by filmmaker Yazman Yazid. He has received several national and international awards for his work, including the S.E.A. Write Award (Southeast Asian Writers Award) in 1995, and a Fellowship through the International Writing Program in Iowa City, Iowa. He has often written for the national newspaper Suara Merdeka, and the famous weekly Tempo. He was staff editor for the Jakarta newspaper, Merdeka from 1979 until 1981, and General Editor for Amanah, a political and religious magazine, from 1986 to 1993. In 2009, Tohari set up a magazine called Ancas (Vision) in his home town. Initially run by just 10 people, the aim of the magazine is to preserve and promote the local Banyumasan language. The venture is proving to be a successful one, with circulation growing from 2,000 to 3,500 in just two years. With his family, he runs an Islamic school (pesantren), and is a well-known export of Javanese folk arts, and a consultant for the regional office of the Indonesian Ministry of Culture and Education. In addition, Tohari has given his support to young writers in his recent endorsement of three new short story compilations, and in the encouragement he has given to a group of writers planning to set up an independent publishing house. Tohari continues to write, and has stated his desire to write one more novel to match Ronggeng Dukuh Paruk.

First arrests  As part of the judiciary investigation on the Imam Rapito case, the Italian justice system discovered an illegal domestic surveillance program run by Marco Mancini, former #2 of the SISMI military intelligence agency, with the help of Giuliano Tavaroli, former chief of security at the Italian Telecom company and of Pirelli, and private Florentine detective Emanuele Cipriani. All authorized requests made by magistrates to make wiretaps passed by Tavaroli.Telecom Italia wiretapping scandal, EDRI-gram - Number 4.15, 2 August 2006 On 21 July 2006, Adamo Bove, predecessor of Tavaroli as responsible of security at the Telecom company and former DIGOS member, died in Naples by falling from a motorway bridge. Bove had discovered a flaw in the system which enabled people to enter the Telecom system and implement wiretaps without leaving a trace. He had announced this fact to the Milan magistrates, leading to the top-secret investigation. Giuliano Tavaroli, the chief of security of Telecom, was arrested on 20 September 2006, along with twenty other persons, including policemen and other members of the secret services, on charges of spying and corruption. The files included reports on the Democrats of the Left (DS) and other politicians.\\"Da Telecom dossier sui Ds\\" Mancini parla dei politici, La Repubblica, 26 January 2007 Marco Mancini and Emanuele Cipriani were arrested on 13 December 2006. They were charged with conspiracy corruption and revealing professional secrets. Mancini allegedly received money from Cipriani and Tavaroli, who constituted approximately 30 reports on magistrates, journalists, businessmen and politicians and members of other intelligence agencies (SISDE). Using confidential information provided by Mancini via his work at SISMI, Cipriani is accused by the Italian magistrates of having constituted files on various figures in the political, media and financial world.Inchiesta Telecom, Mancini arrestato per i dossier e le intercettazioni illegali, La Repubblica, 12 December 2006  5,000 targets  Targets of the surveillance program included La Repubblica reporters Giuseppe D'Avanzo and Carlo Bonini, who broke the Yellowcake forgery story and who also broke this scandal. Valentino's former creative director, Alessandra Facchinetti, was also tapped.Don't Call Us , Vogue, 23 July 2008 Further investigations uncovered that more than 5,000 persons (including politicians, magistrates, football players and referees ) had been placed under illegal surveillance. The scheme, allegedly instigated by Giulio Tavaroli and Marco Mancini, is believed to have begun in 1996. Data was analyzed using Enterprise Miner (from SAS System) and Analyst's Notebook. According to La Repubblica, the main mystery concerned the exact use of these files. Money is one of the first, clear motives: participants in the deal, including Marco Mancini, Giuliano Tavaroli, Emanuele Cipriani, and a former SISDE fiduciary, Marco Bernardini, shared 20 million euros between them.

Biography Schramm was born in Jerusalem. His father, Michael Schramm, was a biochemistry professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He attended Hebrew University, where he received his bachelor's degree in mathematics and computer science in 1986 and his master's degree in 1987, under the supervision of Gil Kalai. He then received his Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1990 under the supervision of William Thurston. After receiving his doctorate, he worked for two years at the University of California, San Diego, and then had a permanent position at the Weizmann Institute from 1992 to 1999. In 1999 he moved to the Theory Group at Microsoft Research in Redmond, Washington, where he remained for the rest of his life. He and his wife had two children, Tselil and Pele. On September 1, 2008, Schramm fell to his death while scrambling Guye Peak, north of Snoqualmie Pass in Washington. Research An illustration by Schramm. A constant theme in Schramm's research was the exploration of relations between discrete models and their continuous scaling limits, which for a number of models turn out to be conformally invariant. Schramm's most significant contribution was the invention of Schramm‚ÄìLoewner evolution, a tool which has paved the way for mathematical proofs of conjectured scaling limit relations on models from statistical mechanics such as self-avoiding random walk and percolation. This technique has had a profound impact on the field. It has been recognized by many awards to Schramm and others, including a Fields Medal to Wendelin Werner, who was one of Schramm's principal collaborators, along with Gregory Lawler. The New York Times wrote in his obituary: Schramm's doctorate. was in complex analysis, but he made contributions in many other areas of pure mathematics, although self-taught in those areas. Frequently he would prove a result by himself before reading the literature to obtain an appropriate credit. Often his proof was original or more elegant than the original. Besides conformally invariant planar processes and SLE, he made fundamental contributions to several topics: * Circle packings and discrete conformal geometry. * Embeddings of Gromov hyperbolic spaces. * Percolation, uniform and minimal spanning trees and forests, harmonic functions on Cayley graphs of infinite finitely generated groups (especially non-amenable groups) and the hyperbolic plane. * Limits of sequences of finite graphs. * Noise sensitivity of Boolean functions, with applications to dynamical percolation. * Random turn games (e.g. random turn hex) and the infinity Laplacian equation. * Random permutations. Awards and honors *Erd≈ës Prize (1996)The Anna and Lajos Erd≈ës Prize in Mathematics, Technion. *Salem Prize (2001) *Clay Research Award (2002), for his work in combining analytic power with geometric insight in the field of random walks, percolation, and probability theory in general, especially for formulating stochastic Loewner evolution.

Throughout their career, they released 15 studio albums, plus numerous live and compilation albums. History=Early years Harem Scarem was formed in 1987 by guitarist Pete Lesperance and singer Harry Hess, formerly of Blind Vengeance who had recorded two heavy metal albums in the '80s. The lineup was rounded out by Darren Smith (drums) and Mike Gionet (bass). They recorded a demo CD in 1990, which garnered them attention since most demos at the time were released on cassette tape only. On the strength of this demo, they were signed to Warner Music and recorded their first album. This demo CD, which was sold to fans, is long out of print. Commercial success In 1991, Harem Scarem released their self-titled debut album, which charted at No. 68 on the Canadian album chart. The band scored a hit single from the album; \\"Slowly Slipping Away\\", which charted at No. 25 on the Canadian single chart. They also managed to chart two minor hits; \\"Honestly\\" and \\"Love Reaction\\". The following year, Harem Scarem was able to gain some notoriety when 8 songs from their debut album Harem Scarem were predominantly featured in the Canadian teen series Degrassi Junior High, and Degrassi High's farewell TV movie, School's Out. Harem Scarem released their second album in 1993, Mood Swings, which had a harder sound to it than their previous album. It also featured the recorded vocal debut of drummer Smith on the song \\"Sentimental Blvd\\". A fan favorite, Mood Swings charted at No. 83 on the Canadian charts. The album's lead off single was \\"No Justice\\", which managed to chart at No. 59 in Canada, while the other two singles failed to chart. Mood Swings caused the band to gain popularity in Japan, and the band's previous album was quickly issued in that country the following year. This was followed by a live and acoustic EP, appropriately titled Live & Acoustic. Short-lived success In 1995, the band released their third album Voice of Reason. The album introduced a change in the band's musical style, and was darker in sound than the first two albums. The song \\"Blue\\" was released as a promotional single and had a music video for it, however it failed to chart. Bassist Mike Gionet departed after Voice of Reason for personal reasons and was replaced by former Blu Bones member Barry Donaghy. The next two albums, Karma Cleansing (which was released as Believe in Japan) and Big Bang Theory, saw Harem Scarem modernizing their sound. Barry Donaghy also made his lead vocal debut with Harem Scarem on \\"Sometimes I Wish\\" from Big Bang Theory. Both albums and the singles from them again failed to chart. In 1998, the band released their last commercial single \\"So Blind\\". Rubber In 1999, Harem Scarem changed their name to Rubber, and released two albums under that name in Canada. However, they still used the name Harem Scarem in Japan and the rest of the world. Pete Lesperance made his recorded lead vocal debut on the song \\"Trip\\" from the self-titled Rubber CD. They made a music video for \\"Sunshine\\", which had actors that looked like Jay and Silent Bob, and parodied movies which were released around that time, such as American Pie. The second album under the Rubber name, Ultra Feel, featured their new drummer Creighton Doane (brother of Melanie Doane) replacing Darren Smith. Smith briefly switched to guitar and joined Helix as a touring musician. The band soon dropped the Rubber name and switched back to their original name, Harem Scarem. Later years and breakup 2002's Weight of the World (released as a Rubber album in some markets) harkened back to the earlier sound of Mood Swings. It was followed in 2003 by Higher. The album's sound was more of a combination of classic melodic rock with a modern production. The album also featured the power ballad \\"Higher\\". The year 2003 also saw the release of Harry Hess' debut solo album Just Another Day. In 2004, Pete Lesperance released his debut solo album Down In It (re-recorded with Mike Turner and released under the band name Fair Ground in 2006). One of their greatest hits is 'No Justice' which has many album sales. Continuing their prolific output of studio albums, 2005's Overload was followed by Human Nature in 2007. The Japanese version of Overload features a cover of the AC/DC classic, \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\". On July 19, 2007, lead singer Harry Hess announced that Harem Scarem \\"will make one more studio record, and then after 20 years we have decided to move on to other things\\".Harem Scarem.net - news update July 19, 2007MelodicRock.com - news posted July 19, 2007 The final album, called Hope, was released July 2008.

The group consists of one MC, Miku, and two singers, Alisa and Yurie. Ya-kyim disbanded in 31 December 2012.  Background  Miku, Alisa, and Yurie have been friends since childhood. Together in 1999, they participated as dancers in Japan's largest hip-hop-based gathering, B Boy Park, and it was also around that time that they began working as performers. They stayed active in Shibuya and officially became Ya-kyim in 2002, returning to the scene of B Boy Park with a live performance. Debut and Victor Entertainment (2005-2007) Their professional debut on the music scene was in 2005 with the single \\"Clap 'n Clap\\" with Victor Entertainment. However, they had also created music a year before their debut, contributing the song \\"Woo, Woo, Wow\\" to a mix CD by DJ Kaori. At the beginning of their career, Ya-kyim appeared in street fashion popularized by hip hop culture, often performing in music videos with tilted hats and baggy clothing. However, around the time of release of the single \\"Beauty x Beauty\\", their appearance undertook a drastic change to a more adult, feminine look to coincide with their coming-of-age. Their music also shifted styles, showcasing a more mature sound. Warner Music Japan (2008-present) Towards the end of 2007, the group left Victor Entertainment and joined Warner Music Japan. In November 2007, Ya-kyim performed a cover version of Can't Help but Wait by Trey Songz. Their official website marked this as an \\"answer song\\" to the original. The group also performed live with Trey Songz at various venues in Japan. The group's first single with Warner Music Japan, Super Looper, was released on May 28, 2008, and was the theme song for TV Asahi drama \\"Kimi hannin janai yo ne?\\" („Ç≠„ÉüÁäØ‰∫∫„Åò„ÇÉ„Å™„ÅÑ„Çà„Å≠Ôºü- You Aren't a Criminal, Are You?) On December 3, 2008, Ya-kyim released a single as part of a \\"Respect\\" project where the group collaborated with a variety of artists as a tribute, including Kome Kome Club, Seamo, Spontania, Dohzi-T, and HI-D. The group performed a cover of Kome Kome Club's song \\"Kimi ga Iru Dake de\\" and created new tracks with the other artists. On July 8, 2009, the group released \\"Tabun Kitto/Happy Face (love version),\\" a double A-side single. The cover of the single's limited edition and the music video for \\"Tabun Kitto\\" feature Popteen models Kumiki and Marimo-chan. The first A-side, \\"Tabun Kitto,\\" was the ending theme for the NTV music program Music Fighter for the month of July. Ya-kyim's first album on Warner Music Japan and fourth album overall, Happy! Enjoy! Fresh! was announced on July 15, 2009. The album has fourteen tracks and features artists such as Pes from Rip Slyme and Cimba, as well as Seamo, Spontania, Dohzi-T, and HI-D from the group's earlier \\"Respect\\" project single. It also features the \\"original version\\" of the song \\"Happy Face\\" from the group's \\"Tabun Kitto/Happy Face\\" single. The album was set to be released on August 19, 2009. Ya-kyim disbanded in the end of 2012, where the group made statement, rather than musical direction, it was about their own direction that differs. They decided to pursue their own dreams fully.

During his professional career, he also pitched for the Los Angeles Angels of the AAA-Class Pacific Coast League (PCL). In 2005, the PCL Hall of Fame elected Prim as a member. Between 1933 and 1946 he appeared in at least one Major League game in six of those years. He played for the Washington Senators, for the Philadelphia Phillies, and for the Chicago Cubs while at the Major League level. While with the Cubs, Prim won the 1945 National League ERA title. Prim started one game in the 1945 World Series, appeared in another, and lost his only decision. In 116 Major League games, he won 22 games and lost 21 games and recorded 161 strikeouts. As a minor league player, Prim won 150 games and posted a career ERA of 3.00 in over 2,000 games. Early life Prim was born in Salitpa, Alabama, to Scots-Irish parents. As a youth, he burned his right hand. As result, though naturally right-handed, he threw with his left-hand, though he batted from the right side of the home plate. He was educated in Jackson, Alabama, and attended college at Alabama Polytechnic Institute, where he lettered in baseball and football. Professional career=Early years In 1928 Prim made his professional baseball debut. That year, he pitched with Alexandria of the Cotton States League; however, Alexandria cut Prim later that season. He did not play professional baseball again until 1930. In 1931 Prim played with the Greensboro Patriots and the Durham Bulls of the C-Class Piedmont League. He won a combined 33 games that year and lost just 14. Prim began the 1933 season with the Albany Senators of the International League where he went 14-10 with a 3.42 ERA. Shortly thereafter, the Chicago Cubs and Boston Braves entered into a dispute over his rights. Kenesaw Mountain Landis, the Commissioner of Baseball, ruled that Albany had the right to sell them to the franchise of their choice. Although the dispute started with the Braves and the Cubs, it was the Washington Senators who won his rights. The majors and the PCL Prim made his major league debut on September 24, 1933, against the Philadelphia Athletics. Prim faced Mickey Cochrane and Jimmie Foxx to start his major league career. He promptly struck out the two future Baseball Hall of Fame members. After two games, Prim underwent surgery on his foot and missed the rest of the year. Over the next few years, Prim spent time with Albany, the Philadelphia Phillies and the Minneapolis Millers. In 1936, the Millers sold Prim to the Los Angeles Angels of the PCL. Prim pitched just one inning for the Millers. Prim spent the next six years with the Angels. In 1936 he won 16 games and lost just nine. Because he was 30 years old at the time, Prim received the nickname 'Pop' from his teammates. By 1943 the United States was deeply involved in World War II and many major league players were drafted in the United States Army. As a result, Prim had the opportunity to play at the major league level for a second time. After 1943 he returned to the Angels for the 1944 season. A year later, he returned to the Cubs. Prim helped the Cubs to make the 1945 World Series with a 13‚Äì8 record, an ERA of 2.40 and two shutouts. His earned run average was the lowest in the National League that year. Prim is the last Cub to lead the league in ERA as of 2014. During the World Series versus the Detroit Tigers, Prim pitched in two games. He lost his only decision. Prim pitched for the Cubs in 1946, it was his last season in the majors. Prim's last year in professional baseball was 1947. At the age of 41, he helped the Angels win another. Because of his outstanding performance while with the Angels, Prim joined the Pacific Coast League Hall of Fame in 2005. Death Prim died on April 29, 1995 in Monte Rio, California and was buried at the Calvary Cemetery in Los Angeles.
