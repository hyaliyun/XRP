History The site is associated with the Odawa people, who settled in the area around West Moran Bay in the late 17th century. The Odawa village, located on the shore of the bay, had at one time 1500 people living in it, and was connected via a trail to the village to the east where St. Ignace is now located. A cemetery (now known as the Gros Cap Cemetery and still in use) was originally adjacent to the tribal village and was used as their burial ground.

Previously he was a frequently fielded player and a captain at Viktoria Plze≈à. Career=FC Viktoria Plze≈à He made his debut for Viktoria Plze≈àSokolov - Plze≈à 1:3, postup v dom√°c√≠m poh√°ru zajistil mistrovi Hora 05.06.2012, fotbal.idnes.cz against Ban√≠k Sokolov on 12 November 2011 in the Czech Cup. After multiple seasons and becoming a starting XI regular, as well as praise for his performances in 2018‚Äì19 UEFA Champions League, it was rumoured that Hro≈°ovsk√Ω will join one of La Liga's or Premier League's teams - Levante, Getafe and Huddersfield were all named as possible future clubs. During the winter transfer window however, Hro≈°ovsk√Ω failed to make a transfer. Later during January 2019 transfer window, West Ham was also cited as a contender for his services, however it was dropped as Manuel Pellegrini doesn't favour altering the squad during the season. Genk2019‚Äì20 season= On 5 June 2019, as Hro≈°ovsk√Ω was preparing with the national team for a double fixture against Jordan and Azerbaijan, it was reported that he was very close to a transfer to Genk. Verbal agreement was apparently complete, yet an issue arose, as Viktoria was happy to let Hro≈°ovsk√Ω go later during the summer transfer period, in order to help them qualify to the group stage of the Champions League. Genk was said to oppose this arrangement. Nonetheless, it was said that the transfer was more-or-less a done deal, as Plze≈à agreed with Wolverhampton Wanderers on a two year loan, with an option to buy for Christi√°n Herc, who had made a good impression during his loan at DAC Dunajsk√° Streda, and was seen as a replacement for Hro≈°ovsk√Ω. On the following day, Hro≈°ovsk√Ω however calmed the rumours, during a press conference prior to the match against Jordan, stating that while negotiations did take place, there is no certainty of a transfer and that he is still a player of Plze≈à. Regardless, this arrangement was confirmed on 8 July 2019, as Hro≈°ovsk√Ω signed a 4-year contract, with an option for an additional year. He made his Jupiler Pro League debut against multiple-time champions Anderlecht Brussels, in a home fixture on 23 August 2020. He completed the last, roughly, 20 minutes, as a replacement for Jakub Piotrowski. Genk secured a narrow 1:0 win with a second- half goal by Mbwana Samatta. Hro≈°ovsk√Ω had recorded five starts for Genk in the UEFA Champions League. He played in both matches against Napoli and Red Bull Salzburg. He played against Liverpool at Anfield only. Genk, however, collected a sole point, for a goal-less tie against Napoli and was knocked out with a score of 5:20. On top of that, Hro≈°ovsk√Ω made sole seasonal appearance in the Croky Cup in a Round of 16 loss against Royal Antwerp. Genk were knocked out after a penalty shoot-out. Hro≈°ovsk√Ω was replaced by Th√©o Bongonda in the second half. As an occasional scorer, Hro≈°ovsk√Ω had to wait until 1 February 2020 for his first goal at Genk. In a league fixture against Charleroi, he had beaten Nicolas Penneteau with a back-heel goal in the 39th minute, utilising a pass from Junya Ito. He was replaced by Kristian Thorstvedt in the second-half. Genk won 1:0. =2019‚Äì20 season= Hro≈°ovsk√Ω missed the first three games of the season, not even making it to the bench with reports that he was no longer considered by the manager Hannes Wolf. He sidelined along with Joseph Paintsil, despite being acquired for considerable sums earlier. International career On 19 November 2014, Hro≈°ovsk√Ω made his debut for the senior Slovakia squad when he started in a friendly against Finland.

Panton was born in Knockiemil, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, the son of John Panton (of the Hudson's Bay Company service) and his wife Alexina McKay, n√©e Anderson. Joseph Panton was educated at the Scottish Naval and Military Academy, developing an interest in drawing. He later studied geology amongst other subjects at the University of Edinburgh, but did not finish a degree. Panton's uncle, Colonel Joseph Anderson, suggested that he migrate to Australia; Panton arrived in Sydney aboard the Thomas Arbuthnot in March 1851. He then went to the Port Phillip District. After farming briefly at Mangalore, Panton tried for gold without luck at Mount Alexander. Then Panton applied for a position as an officer in the gold escort and was appointed assistant commissioner in 1852 at Kangaroo Gully near Bendigo, Victoria. A year later he was senior assistant commissioner at Bendigo and then senior commissioner in 1854. Panton investigated resentment against the Chinese gold-diggers and recommended a Chinese protectorate; this was adopted by Governor Charles Hotham in 1855. Panton had helped to organize the Melbourne Exhibition in 1854 and was a commissioner for the Melbourne International Exhibition (1880). In 1858, Panton went to Scotland and then to Paris to study art with a friend of his, Hubert de Castella. On Panton's return to Australia, he was appointed warden and magistrate at the Jamieson-Wood's Point and next at the Anderson's Creek goldfields. Panton then became magistrate at Heidelberg, where he also mapped the Yarra Valley, naming Panton Hill. Panton's Gap where the road to Ben Cairn and Donna Buang branches from the Don Road near Healesville, Victoria derives its name from a small house he had there. He also named Mount Donna Buang which he first called Mount Acland but renamed it after learning the Aboriginal name. From Heidelberg, Panton was transferred to Geelong and moved to Melbourne as senior magistrate from 1874 to 1907. Panton was active in the Victorian Artists Association and the Victorian Academy of Art which developed into the Victorian Artists Society. A fellow of the Royal Geographical Society (London), Panton was also vice-president of the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia, Victorian Branch. In 1895 Panton declined the honour of knighthood but was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG). Predeceased by his wife, he died at St. Kilda, Victoria on 25 October 1913 and was survived by two daughters, one of whom, Alice, was a well-known portrait painter. In 1882, the Victorian government botanist, Ferdinand von Mueller named a newly described plant from Western Australia, Eremophila pantonii in his honour.

It is unclear why living people are added to this list. As a result of the listing, credit bureaus return reports of \\"deceased\\" to entities seeking checks on the individuals' credit reports, which can prevent people from attaining credit, receiving government benefits, renting apartments, or securing jobs, and interfere with anything involving credit checks or Social Security. Credit zombies may even find their bank accounts frozen and have no access to their money. The term \\"credit zombie\\" is an analogy to the concept of the zombie being a person who was once alive walking around as if he still is.

Epigraphic records The first epigraphic record which mentions Kamarupa is the Allahabad inscription of Samudra Gupta where Kamarupa is mentioned as a frontier kingdom along with Samatata, Davaka, Nepal and Kartripura the kings of which fully gratified the imperious commands of Samudra Gupta \\"by giving all kinds of taxes and obeying his orders and coming to perform obeisance\\".Fleet Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum - vol.III, P.14 Pushyavarman was succeeded by his son Samudravarman who was perhaps the contemporary of Chandra Gupta II Vikramaditya and the celebrated poet Kalidasa. In the Nidhanpur inscription it is stated that there was no \\"matsyanyaya\\" in his kingdom and that Samudravarman was like the fifth ocean.Epigraphia Indica, vol XII The word \\"matsyanyaya\\" has been explained as anarchy due to the absence of a strong ruler when the powerful people oppress the weak just as the larger fish devour the smaller fry. The mention of this word seems to indicate that there was such anarchy during the reigns of his predecessors. It may be that after such anarchy was ended Pushyavarman rose to power or that after the accession of Pushyavarman the anarchy ended. Kashmir Chronicles With regard to the next king Balavarman I, the son of Samudravarman by his queen Datta Devi, the Nidhanpur inscription states that \\"his irresistible troops constituted his armour\\". It appears therefore that he was a powerful king and a conqueror. There is mention in the Kashmir chronicle Rajatarangini that king Meghavahana of Kashmir married a Pragjyotisha princess named Amritaprabha. It is stated that the king of Pragjyotisha held a svayamvara for the marriage of the princess. Of all the princes assembled Amritaprabha's choice fell upon the Kashmir prince Meghavahana. It is recorded that \\"there in the presence of the kings Meghavahana received from the princess Amritaprabha the bridegrom's garland while the parasol of Varuna cast its shade upon him. By this the people knew his future greatness as by the west wind the gathering of clouds. Because this parasol, which king Naraka had carried away frown Varuna cast its shade on no one but a sovereign of the whole globe (Chakravartin).Rajatarangini- Book II, p.148-150 This parasol or umbrella is mentioned also in the Harsha Charita of Bana wherein it is stated that it was an heirloom of the kings of the dynasty of Naraka. It is also stated there that King Bhaskaravarman, through his envoy Hangshavega, presented this umbrella to Sri Harshavardhana. It is stated that queen Amritaprabha erected in Kashmir a lofty Vihara for the benefit of the foreign bhiksus and that this Vihara was known as Amritabhavan. It is further stated that Amritaprabha took to Kashmir a Tibetan Buddhist scholar named Stunpa who was a preceptor of her father, the Kamarupa king. This Stunpa erected a stupa in Kashmir known as \\"Lo-stunpa\\".Rajatarangini - Book III, p.9 It the above statements are to be believed as true it would appear that Buddhism had spread into Kamarupa long before the visit of Xuanzang, that a remote ancestor of Bhaskaravarman was a Buddhist and that the cultural connection between Kamarupa and Tibet, began as early as fifth century A.D. According to Kahlan, the author of the Rajatarangini, Meghavahana was succeeded by Sresthisena and the latter by Toramana. If this Toramana is identical with the Ephthalic king Toramana, the father of the famous Mihiragula, the king of the white Huns who ruled over the Punjab and possibly also over Kashmir, then he cannot be placed earlier than the third quarter of the fifth century A.D. The identification would probably be correct for, according to Kahlan, Toramana struck coins in his name extensively and such coins have, as a matter of fact, been discovered in large quantities. These bear the name Toramana in characters of the Gupta period. This being so, Meghavahana may be placed about the second quarter of the fifth century though Kahlan's chronology places him in the first century and he was probably the son in law of the Kamarupa king Balavarman I. This matrimonial alliance and the celebration of the Svayamvara indicates that Pragjyotisha or Kamarupa was then an important kingdom in northern India and that it was no longer a mere frontier kingdom as in the days of Pushyavarman. Other accounts Vincent Smith mentions that in the year 428 A.D., during the reign of emperor Kumara Gupta, an embassy was sent to China by an Indian king named Yue-ai (Moon-loved) who was lord of the Ka-pi-Ii country. Lt. Col. Wilson has identified Ka-pi-li with the Kapili river of Assam named in the Kalika purana as Kapila-Ganga, and Vincent Smith has tentatively accepted this identification.Vincent Smith, Early History of India, p.316 The Kapili valley, which is still called Davaka, may be identified with the kingdom of Davaka mentioned in the Allahabad inscription of Sumudra Gupta. The embassy may therefore have been sent by the king of Davaka whose name was either Chandra Priya or Chandra Vallabha. It should however be mentioned that there was a king of Kamarupa named Chandra-mukha (moon-faced) who was the great- grandfather of Bhaskaravarman. He cannot, however, be assigned to the second quarter of the fifth century. It seems that in the sixth or the seventh century this kingdom of Davaka was absorbed by Kamarupa, for according to Xuanzang's account the Kapili valley was included in Kamarupa. The kings after Balavarman were Kalyanavarman, Ganapativarman, Mahendravarman and Narayanavarman who do not appear to have been much renowned. Copper plate seals and inscriptions Bhaskaravarman Nalanda seal According to the Nidhanpur inscription, Ganapativarman was generous in his gifts while Narayanavarman was, like king Janaka, deeply versed in the knowledge of the self. Narayanavarman was succeeded by his son Mahabhutavarman who is named in the Harsha Charita as Bhutivarman. It was he who granted, to a large number of Brahmans, lands in the Chadrapuri vishaya. The copper-plate relating to this grant having been destroyed by fire his great great grand son Bhaskaravarman recorded, what is known as the Nidhanpur grant, to confirm the gift made by his ancestor. Originally only three plates of this inscription were discovered by Pandit Padmanath Bhattacharya Vidya Vinod who contributed a paper on them in Epigraphia Indica vol XII. Subsequently, two more plates found were described by Pandit Vidya Vindod in XIX of the Epigraphia Indica. The third lost plate was again discussed by him in the same journal. One more plate is still missing. The newly discovered plates mention the names of Chandrapuri vishaya, Kausika River and Mayura-Salmala agrahara. The occurrence of the word \\"agrahara\\" seems to indicate the existence of a temple for the maintenance of which and its Shebaits the lands were granted. As the inscription begins with the adoration of ashbesmeared Mahadeva it is clear that these Kamarupa kings were all devotees of Siva. As a matter of fact Siva is invoked in the inscription as the istadevata of the donor. Further in the Harsha Charita it is stated that Bhaskaravarman worshiped only the lotus-feet of Siva. So it may be assumed that the agrahara mentioned in the inscription was no other than a Siva temple. The further discovered plates contain the names of the donees, who number more than 200. From this list it can find such names as Vishnu-Ghosha, Arka-Datta, Rishi-Dama, Dama-Deva, Dhurva-Soma, Vishnu-Palita, Gayatri-Pala, Yajna-Kunda, Padma-Dassa, Tosha-Naga and Gopala- Nandi. It is curious that the surname Ghosha, Datta, Dama, Deva, Soma, Palita, Pala, Kundu, Dasa, Naga and Nandi are now confided to Kayasthas of Bengal but not to Brahmans. One authority named Dr. Bhandarkar has pointed out that identical surnames were used by the Nagar-Brahmans. It is not known when and how such a colony of Brahmans came to be settled in Kamarupa near the Kosi River as early as the beginning of the sixth century. Pandit Vidya Vinod's surmise that most of the Brahman families in the neighbouring province of modern Bengal are the, descendant; of these Brahmans from Kamarupa seems to rest on good foundation.Epigrapgia Indica - vol XIX, p.246 The Nidhanpur inscription is an epigraphic record of very great historic value. In the first part of the sixth century during the reign of Narayanavarman or his son Mahabhuta Varmran. Yasodharman king of Malwa, who defeated Mihiragula, the leader of the white Huns, is said to have conquered the whole of northern India from the Brahmaputra to the western ocean. This is recorded in his Mandasor pillar inscriptionFleet Corp. Ins. Ind., p.146 wherein it is emphasized that Yasodharman conquered territories which even the Guptas (on the east) and the Huns (on the west) failed to penetrate. It is possible to detect here a reference to Kamarupa which was always outside the Gupta Empire. The invasion of Kamarupa by Yasodharman is here indicated. It is not known how far this invasion was successful. Anyway, the conquest of Eastern India by Yasodharman, in the early part of the sixth century, shows that about that period the Gupta power in Magadha was nearly extinct. Boundaries Kamarupa, Guptas, Davaka, Licchavis, Pundravardhana, Samatata, Vakatakas, Western Satraps As a matter of fact the Imperial Guptas ceased to rule after the close of the fifth century and, as remarked by Vincent Smith, that line passed by an obscure transition into what is known as the dynasty of the \\"Later Guptas of Magadha\\". This dynasty did not exercise sovereignty even over the whole of Magadha, part of which came under the sway of the Varmans of Maukhari. Taking advantage of the decline of the Gupta power the Kamarupa kings appear to have extended their kingdom towards the west. Down to the end of the fifth century the tract of country between the Teesta and the Kosi formed the Pundravardhana Bhukti of the Gupta Empire. In the first quarter of the sixth century it can find this tract within the Kamarupa kingdom. Mahabhutavarman's grant referred to above may be dated about 525 A.D. This grant consisted of lands in the Chandrapuri Vishaya within the present district of Purnea for, according to the Nidhanpur inscription, the lands granted were on the banks of the old channel of the Kausika or Kosi.Kamarupa Sasanavali, p.41 Rennell's map of Bengal (1783) shows the position of the old channel of the Kosi. It appears that this river originally took an easterly course and flowing to the west of Purnea fell into the Ganges at Rajmahal or nearly forty miles below its present confluence with the Ganges. It appears from the Nidhanpur inscription that the river had already abandoned its old channel by the time Bhaskaravarman confirmed his ancestor's grant. That the Kausika, mentioned in the inscription, is the Kosi River in modern Bihar admits of no doubt, but certain writers have attempted to identity Kausika with the Kusiara river in Sylhet.IHQ - vol VII, no. 4 These writers conveniently forget that in the ninth century another Kamarupa king, named Vanamala, granted lands adjoining the Chandrapuri Vishaya and, in order to localize the lands more definitely. He stated in his inscription that the lands lay to the west of the Teesta (Trisrotayah paschimatah). After this, any attempt to locate the Chandrapuri Vishava anywhere in the Sylhet district cannot but be regarded as childish. Confrontation with Guptas Towards the close of the sixth century the dynasty of the Later Guptas produced a powerful king named Mahasena Gupta. By checking the Maukharis in mid-India he re-established the Gupta power to some extent. After this he turned his attention towards the east where the Kamarupa kings had appropriated to themselves the whole of the Pundravardhana bhukti. He was therefore compelled to declare war against the then Kamarupa king Susthitavarman, the father of Bhaskaravarman. It appears that Susthitavarman sustained a crushing defeat and Mahasena Gupta earned a Treat victory which was glorified by his grandson in the Aphshad inscription. It is stated in this inscription that Susthitavarman was defeated by Mahasena Gupta \\"whose mighty fame, marked in honour of victory over the illustrious Susthitavarman (and white) as a full-blown Jasmine flower or water-lily, or as a pair of necklace of pearls pounded into little bits, is still constantly sung on the banks of the Brahmaputra, the surfaces of which are (so) cool, by the Siddhas in pairs, when they wake up after sleeping in the shade of the betel plants that are in full bloom\\".Fleet Corp. Ins. Ind. - vol III, p.206 This panegyric was justified for the victory had really important political consequences. Mahasena Gupta recovered the whole of the Pundravardhana bhukti and the Kamarupa boundary was pushed back to the Teesta- Karatoya. The result was that the territories which included the lands donated by Mahabhutavarman in the previous century were lost to Kamarupa. When in the early part of the seventh century Sasanka was overthrown, Bhaskaravarman re-acquired the lost tracts and confirmed the grant of his ancestor. This explains why the confirmation was issued immediately after the overthrow of Sasanka and from the victorious camp itself where Bhaskaravarman was \\"accompanied by a fleet of war-boats, war- elephants, cavalry and infantrv.\\" Susthitavarman, though defeated, was a great king and therefore in the Aphshad inscription he is described as \\"illustrious\\". The victory over him and the recovery of the territories were therefore regarded as a great triumph as the text of the inscription indicates. Susthitavarman could not retaliate for the defeat during his lifetime. He left this duty to his worthy son Bhaskaravarman.

Richard Gordon had played a character named Jimmy but all the scenes involving the character were cut from the final release.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105836/fullcredits#cast Originally, both Marisa Tomei and Julianne Moore auditioned for the lead role of Helen.

Overseas Film Group had also picked up foreign rights, already selling the film in a number of territories. Plot Helen, a divorced, attractive twenty-something Los Angeles office worker, has just broken up with her possessive boyfriend Paul. Living beyond her means, Helen soon loses her car and her apartment, and has to move in with her friend Donald, an aspiring screenwriter. Helen helps Donald with his screenplay, while secretly writing her own. Donald introduces Helen to Max, a producer who takes an interest in her and her screenplay.

These, however, are typical first-film flaws, easily forgivable in the light of Sibay's overall accomplishment.\\" Bob Strauss of the Los Angeles Daily News wrote: \\"A Woman, Her Men and Her Futon aspires to be an up-to-the-minute report from the front of the war between the sexes. Some of the film's particulars feel a tad dated, and the basic conflict, of course, is as old as Adam and Eve. But despite its familiarity and predictable, self- pitying tone, Futon generates a remarkable degree of behavioral credibility. Thanks to a solid, multilayered performance by Rubin, Sibay concocts a spare, sexy movie, a tale of old-fashioned romantic confusion that often seems fresh.\\" TV Guide gave the film two out of four stars and described the film as a \\"slow-moving drama\\", which \\"drags in spots, but [is] well acted and has good production values\\". The reviewer added: \\"It also intelligently addresses the issues of manipulation, frustration and false hope that take place within relationships.\\" After the film was shown at the Stockholm International Film Festival, movie critic Susanne Ljung wrote: \\"This film should be obligatory pepping for all young women! Women's shaky way to independence, both sexual and professional, is all too seldom portrayed as sensitively and penetratingly as in this film.\\" The Dutch VPRO Cinema awarded the film three and a half stars out of five and wrote: \\"An independent production in the tradition of Sex, Lies & Videotape, [but] without this level being reached. The parallel between Helen and the film project being talked about is a bit too obvious.\\" Joe Leydon of Variety (magazine) stated: \\"Provocative title and a few steamy scenes are the only conceivable selling points for Sibay's A Woman, Her Men and Her Futon. Small-budget pic is by turns laughably stilted and sophomorically self-referential as a drama about L.A. scriptwriter wannabes, their sexual hang-ups and their mind games.\\" In their DVD & Video Guide 2004, authors Mick Martin and Marsha Porter gave an unfavorable review: \\"Pointless film about a shallow woman who uses men for sex, money, and her career. She's so insipid and unsympathetic that it's painful to watch.\\" Iotis Erlewine of AllMovie gave the film a two out of five star rating.

The virus is not exceptionally widespread, but rather has only infected small groups of computers. Related to the Kenshin, Doraemon, and Naturo viruses, the virus has infected computers in various parts of the world. It is written in a high level programming language, known as Visual Basic. The virus is only 53 KB in size and creates two files on the computers it infects, an EXE file and an INF file. History *In order to prevent the computer user from recognizing the threat and removing it from the system, scripts are written to prevent the Task Manager from opening and to disable Registry Tools. Microsoft Visual Studio Debugging Tools are also targeted by these script, making it impossible for certain drivers to access this information. Unlike some more aggressive viruses, this worm is relatively benign for the computers it manages to infect. *Experts guess that the writers of this particular virus likely did so simply for the fun of it, as it serves next to no purpose for the author of the worm. The only effects of infection that will be evident to the computer user are that files and folders may be hidden from view. This can occur both on the computer system itself and any flash media used with the machine. Computer infections The BuluBebek virus is not spread on the Internet like many other viruses, by primarily is transmitted to other systems through flash media drives. For this reason, the virus has thankfully remained relatively uncommon. Systems that are infected will pass the worm on if they access or create files on a flash drive that is in turn used in another system. For this reason, it remains important for infected computer users to remove the offending files as quickly as possible. Detection and removal *Fortunately, most major antivirus packages will recognize the BuluBebek virus if a full system scan is run. When this occurs, the Antivirus software will quarantine suspicious files and notify the computer user of the issue at hand. If the user wishes to do so, the BuluBebek virus can also be removed from the infected system manually. *In order to manually remove the virus, the computer user will need to disconnect from the Internet and temporarily disable System Restore. At this point, an alternative software program to Task Manager should be used to access the Running Process Memory. Here, the process can be killed permanently and specialized script can be entered to restore the registry to its original condition before the infection occurred on the machine.

Latterly it was the Sea Harrier training squadron based at RNAS Yeovilton. 899 Naval Air Squadron was reformed in 1979 as the training squadron for the Sea Harrier. It was initially based at RNAS Yeovilton (HMS Heron) until it was decommissioned in 2005 prior to the Stand up of 800 Naval Air Squadron GR7 at RAF Cottesmore. Earlier operations 899 NAS saw service during the Second World War and was mostly deployed in the Mediterranean Sea. Gibraltar - Between March 1943 and August 1943 899 Sqn. FAA (Ex HMS Indomitable) was disembarked at R.N.A.S. Cormorant II(North Front) when the carrier was damaged by torpedo. It was disbanded when the war ended. In 1955 the squadron was recommissioned and deployed to Egypt on Operation Musketeer during the Suez Crisis. During the 1960s, the squadron was deployed to the African continent a number of times. In 1965 it deployed on board HMS Eagle to Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) in light of the government's dispute with the British Crown and issuing of its internationally unrecognised Unilateral Declaration of Independence. The squadron provided air support during the Beira Patrol blockade, remaining at sea for a record 72 days. In 1967, with the disintegration of the Protectorate of South Arabia, a Sea Vixen of 899 NAS was the last British military aircraft to leave Aden carrying the British flag. During this period the squadron operated Sea Vixen aircraft at R.N.A.S. Yeovilton and on board HMS Eagle. 899 NAS did not take part directly in the Falklands War. However it supplied personnel to both 800 NAS (HMS Hermes) and 801 NAS (HMS Invincible). It also allowed 809 Naval Air Squadron to be set up specially for the Falklands War. During the 1990s, the squadron was called into action for the Yugoslav Wars as part of NATO peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina. From 1993 until its disbandment the squadron took on the role as the training squadron for Harrier pilots. 899 NAS trained personnel for the front line squadrons 800 Naval Air Squadron and 801 Naval Air Squadron. These squadrons were deployed as required in HMS Hermes (R12), HMS Invincible (R05), HMS Illustrious (R06) and HMS Ark Royal (R07).

Included among Aesop's Fables, it is numbered 179 in the Perry Index.Aesopica site The fable The fable only appears in Greek sources in classical times. There an ass in the employ of a gardener complains to the king of the gods that he is not fed adequately and asks for a change of master. He is transferred to a potter and prays for another change because the loads are so heavy. Now he passes to a tanner and regrets leaving his first employer. At a time when slavery was common, the fable was applied to the dissatisfaction felt by slaves.William Fitzgerald, Slavery and the Roman Literary Imagination, Cambridge University 2000, p.101 In Renaissance times two Neo-Latin poets contributed to making the story better known. Gabriele Faerno as Asinus dominus mutans, with the moral that a change of master only brings worse;Fabulae Centum, fable 69 and Hieronymus Osius as Asinus et olitor (The ass and the gardener), with the comment that habitual dissatisfaction always brings a desire for change.Aesopus Phryx, fable 80 Jean de la Fontaine also added the story to his Fables with the even harsher comment that providence has better things to do than listen to those who are never satisfied.VI.11 In Britain the fable was generally known under the title \\"The ass and Jupiter\\" and appears as such in the prose collections of Samuel Croxall,Fable 118 Thomas Bewick,The Fables of Aesop p.79 and the poetical version of Brooke Boothby.fable 16 The Dutch painter Dirck Stoop also made an etching of the fable under that title in 1655.LACMA collection Change is never for the better Laurentius Abstemius told a different version of the fable in his Hecatomythium (1490). In this the ass, tired of cold and only straw to eat, pines for the end of winter. In spring there is so much work that he wishes for summer, and then for autumn, under the burdens each season brings him, and in the end 'his last Prayer is for Winter again; and that he may but take up his Rest where he began his Complaint'.Roger L'Estrange's translation Phaedrus, who was a freed slave, did not record the fable about the discontented ass, but a similar moral appears at the end of his version of The Frogs Who Desired a King. The citizens of Athens are grumbling at their new ruler and Aesop advises them, after he has told the fable, 'hoc sustinete, maius ne veniat, malum (hang on to your present evil, lest it become worse).The Fables of Phaedrus I.2 Some quite different stories exist with much the same moral as this, retaining certain aspects of the story-line of \\"The Ass and his Masters\\". These include a succession of three changes, each worse than before, followed by prayer for the preservation of the last. An early Tudor jest book records a later Classical anecdote. In this an old lady prays for the continued well-being of the tyrant Dionysius I of Syracuse. On being asked by him why, she replies, Merry Tales and Quick Answers tale 47 The story had earlier appeared in Thomas Aquinas' De Regimine Principum, in the context of a discussion of the drawbacks of resisting tyranny.Shirley Robin Letwin, On The History Of The Idea Of Law, Cambridge University 2005, p.80 Slightly earlier in the Middle Ages, Odo of Cheriton had drawn a similar lesson from a monastic situation. His light-hearted story concerns monks who pray for the death of their abbot. The first had given them three courses at a meal but not enough to satisfy their hunger; after his death he is succeeded by an abbot who allows them only two courses, and then on his death by one who allows only a single course. One of the monks then prays for the long life of this abbot for fear that they might starve altogether under a successor.Aesopica site ReferencesExternal links * Book illustrations from the 16th - 19th centuries Ass and his Masters Fables by Laurentius Abstemius Ass and his Masters Ass and his Masters ","title":"The Ass and his Masters"},{"id":"36046564","text":"Variimorda ihai is a species of tumbling flower beetles in the subfamily Mordellinae of the family Mordellidae.

It began generating in 2017 with capacity of 28.56 MW. Although the government had authorized the dam, it suspended construction in February 2015 after protests. The President of the Republic authorized the partial restart of construction in August 2015, but prohibited the filling of the reservoir pending a final agreement. Important issues concerning the dam are controversial, such as the question whether the indigenous communities in the area initially had expressed their support or their opposition to the dam's construction and how well they had been informed about the project and its impacts prior to expressing their views. Technical features The dam was designed to minimize the impact on the river, never leaving any section of the river dry. The roller-compacted concrete gravity dam is to have a maximum height of and a maximum reservoir surface of , including currently occupied by the Tabasara River and that would be inundated, according to the project design document submitted to the UN Clean Development Mechanism Executive Board. of the inundated land would be located In the indigenous territory (Comarca) of the Ng√∂be‚ÄìBugl√© people. The installed capacity of the planned hydropower plant is 28.84 Megawatt. Ownership and financing The project developer is Generadora del Istmo S. A. (GENISA), a Panamanian special purpose company created specifically for this project. GENISA is owned by the Kafie family: the public registry lists Luis Kafie (President), Luis Jose Kafie (Treasurer and Director), Shukri Kafie (Director), Eduardo Kafie (Director), Eduardo Kafie Atala (Director) and Christoper Kafie (Director) as member of the board of GENISA. The project is financed by loans that have been provided by two European state-owned banks that promote private sector investments in developing countries, the German Investment Corporation (DEG) and the Netherlands Development Finance Company (FMO),Forum Umwelt und Entwicklung (Forum for Environment and Development): Das UN-Klimakompensationsprojekt Barro Blanco erschwert die Friedensverhandlungen in Panama (The UN Climate Project Barro Blanco makes peace negotiations in Panama more difficult), 19 March 2012, retrieved on 8 December 2012. as well as by the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI). CABEI approved a USD 25 million loan to the project developer in 2011. Total funding from the three banks amounts to USD 78.3 million. Context of the conflict There is a long-standing conflict between the Ng√§be people and the government concerning mining and the construction of dams for hydropower generation in or near their territory. The Ng√§be-Bugl√© Comarca was created in 1997 for the use of the Ng√§be and Bugl√© indigenous communities.Cansari and Gausset, 2013 Despite this during the 1970s the Panamanian government proposed to dam the Tabasara with a 220MW hydroelectric project designed to supply energy to the proposed Colorado Copper Mines. This project was cancelled following widespread protests.Orozco, 2013 They had won the first battle of the Tabasara dams, however, during the 1990s another project was proposed - this time a 48MW dam, they again successfully defeated this proposal.Campbell, 2014 This thereafter resulted in the Panamanian government changing national law in order to repeal requirements related to participation from indigenous communities.Runk, 2012 This long history of conflict regarding their traditional and spiritual lands has resulted in the prolonged social mobilisation of the Ng√§be-Bugl√© communities. Environmental and social impact According to GENISA, no indigenous village or houses would be inundated by the reservoir and no one would be resettled. However 5 hectares of stream bed will be flooded during the rainy season. The land to be inundated consists of ravines close to the river that are not suitable for agriculture or livestock grazing. According to another source the area to be flooded is , or 189 hectares. However, critics allege that the livelihoods of some 5000 Ng√∂be farmers who rely on the river for potable water, agriculture and fishing will be negatively impacted, and primary forest would be cut down. They also say that the impacted communities have never provided their free, prior and informed consent to the project. Furthermore, they say that the habitat of the endangered Tabasar√° rain frog would be destroyed. GENISA says that the Tabasar√° rain frog lives in several habitats in Panama, including in the Anton Valley hundreds of kilometers away from the site. Chronology=Concession award and environmental impact study (2006-2008) In 2006, under the government of President Mart√≠n Torrijos, an international public tender was announced for various hydropower projects in Panama, including Barro Blanco. Among the four participating companies GENISA was selected. The Public Services Authority ASEP authorized GENISA to prepare studies and, subject to obtaining all relevant approvals, to develop the Barro Blanco project. GENISA commissioned an Environmental Impact Study. As part of this study, in August 2007 in a public forum with the participation of local authorities, villagers close to the project were asked about their view of the dam. At the time, the indigenous M-10 Movement rejected the dam, because it considered indigenous people would lose their land, would not be able to use the river any more and because the environment would be harmed. However, most of the consulted people supported the project, because it would provide jobs, better road access and improved living standards. Some of those who were opposed to the project subsequently sold their land to the project developer. In December 2007, GENISA and representatives of the Ngobe Bugle people signed a cooperation agreement that included safeguards for the fundamental rights of the indigenous people. In May 2008 the Panamanian Environmental Authority ANAM approved the project based on the study. In December 2008 GENISA signed a Memorandum of Understanding in which it committed itself to implement a social development plan for the indigenous communities living next to the dam, including \\"infrastructure, health and education programs\\" during the construction and during the operation of the dam. In January 2009 a validation team consisting of the consulting firm AENOR working for the UN CDM Executive Board visited the area and confirmed \\"that the most relevant communities involved in the area of the project were consulted, all of them supported the project activity, and project participant (i.e. GENISA) has forecasted several social compensation measurements for the communities involved.\\" The International Rivers Network says that the validation report by AENOR was flawed, since allegedly only the non-indigenous population had been consulted and they had failed to take into account all comments received. In 2009 the concession contract between the government and GENISA was signed. Increase of capacity and controversy about impact study (2009-2010) After presidential elections in early 2009, in June 2009 Ricardo Martinelli, a businessman who promised to quickly upgrade Panama's infrastructure, took office as President of Panama. In May 2009 GENISA requested a modification of the permit to increase the capacity by 52% to 28.8 Megawatt by moving the turbines to a lower elevation, without increasing the water level in the reservoir. The original environmental study and the permit referred to an installed capacity of only 19 Megawatt. In January 2010 ANAM approved the modification, and in January 2011 the concession contract was modified accordingly. As of 2010, according to the UN CDM project document, 98% of the land to be inundated was owned by GENISA. According to critics, the environmental impact study was flawed, because impacts on biodiversity were assessed superficially and because the capacity of the plant was increased. In late 2010 the European Investment Bank withdrew funding for the dam after an investigation into human rights abuses prompted by NGO protests. In January 2011 DEG and FMO approved their loans for the project. Indigenous approval despite conflict about mining (2011) In February 2011, the Panamanian government proposed a new mining law that would facilitate the development of mining projects in indigenous areas, while the indigenous people had asked for a law banning mining in their territories. The proposal and the simultaneous launching of bids for a large copper mining project called Cerro Colorado triggered protests of indigenous people, including local communities from the Barro Blanco area, who blocked the Interamerican Highway for four days. The protests were violently suppressed. The conflict was temporarily ended through the San Felix agreement, signed in the village of San Felix. Construction of the dam began in February 2011. On June 25, 2011, according to the project developer GENISA, the regional congress of the K√§driri, the local group of Ng√§be people, approved by public majority voting that the construction of the dam should continue, after having been authorized to take a decision by the General Congress of the Ng√§be-Bugl√©. Also in June 2011 the UN Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Board approved the carbon finance proposal that was to generate part of the revenue stream for the project. On August 25, 2011, a Compensation and Benefits Agreement was signed between GENISA and the Board of the Regional Congress of the K√§driri. International campaign and UN inspection (2012-13) However, the conflict remained unresolved. The government called for a referendum on the dam, but the indigenous leader Silvia Carrera, elected as Cacica General in September 2011, initially rejected it. An international campaign was started to stop construction of the dam and international funding for it. In March 2012 Parliament passed a modified version of the mining law that prohibited mining in the indigenous territory and required the approval of the Ng√∂be Bugl√© General Congress for any future hydroelectric projects.The Panama Digest:Mining Banned to Protect the Ng√∂be Bugl√© Shire, 27 March 2012 However, the traditional authorities of the Ng√∂be criticized Silvia Carrera for having given in. They had asked for a complete ban on hydropower projects to be included in the law.Cultural Survival:Campaign Update ‚Äì Panama: Ng√∂be Dialogue Ends in New Mining Law, Protests Continue, 22 March 2012 Construction had to be halted in May 2012, because the local population occupied the site. The protests were suspended while \\"UN inspectors\\" were expected to visit the area.Don Winner:Role Of The United Nations Questioned - Barro Blanco Hydro Electric Project , Panama-Guide.com, 31 May 2012 In September 2012 an inspection team led by UNDP and consisting of representatives of the Catholic Church, the environmental agency ANAM, the electricity regulatory agency ASEP and the project developer GENISA, visited the area. The purpose of the inspection was to verify on the ground issues that had not been answered satisfactorily in the environmental impact assessment. The inspection team presented its report in December 2012, recommending a water flow simulation to understand the impact of sudden floods as well as a participatory rural appraisal. In March 2013 an indigenous protester against the dam was killed by masked assailants. In July 2013, James Anaya, UN special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous people, visited Panama and spoke to the Ng√∂be. In his report he concluded that the Ng√∂be \\"were not properly consulted\\". Prior to the visit 12 local and international civil society organizations had asked Anaya to conduct a formal investigation into the human rights impacts of the dam and to call on the government to \\"immediately halt the dam‚Äôs construction until the threats to the rights of the indigenous Ng”ìbe people affected by the project have been fully addressed\\". On September 6, 2013, the United Nations released three reports on the water flow simulation, a participatory rural appraisal as well as an ecological and economic analysis conducted by two independent international experts, Gonzalo Castro de la Mata and Luis Lopez, showing that the dam had no impact on global biodiversity, but had \\"real and important impacts\\" on the indigenous populations living in the area. However, the report did not mention that any villages would be inundated. Furthermore, the experts concluded that \\"the local population had not been correctly consulted\\". They also concluded that the local population had \\"a rudimentary and often erroneous knowledge of the project, being a product of rumors, often without foundation\\". Together with the insufficient consultation this had created a climate of fear.UNDP Panama Press Release:Presentan resultados del peritaje independiente al proyecto hidroel√©ctrico Barro Blanco, retrieved on March 17, 2016 Complaints and suspension of works (2014-2016) In April 2014 Silvia Carrera, the Cacica General of the Comarca Ng√§be-Bugl√©, submitted a complaint to the Independent External Panels of DEG and FMO. In May 2015 the joint review of the panels found that the banks had failed to fully comply with the standards to which they had committed themselves. While the banks took significant steps to understand the situation as part of their due diligence process, they accepted an indigenous peoples report that was insufficient for the purpose to approve the credit in January 2011, requiring further investigations as a condition for disbursement, while their own standards would have required a fully satisfactory report at the time of approval. The two banks accepted the conclusions and committed themselves to \\"further raise the bar on the required level of information on stakeholder consultation available to (them) at the time of credit approval.\\" In the meantime, the government of Panama - since June 2014 led by a new President, Juan Carlos Varela - suspended the construction of the dam in February 2015 on the grounds that the environmental and social impact assessment was faulty pending the outcome of a court case that challenges the assessment. In June 2015 new protests erupted, with protesters shutting down the Interamerican Highway for two days, as a result of which the President sent a riot squad to the area. In August 2015 President Varela and the Cacia General of the indigenous Comarca, Silvia Carrera, signed an agreement to the effect that the civil works of the dam would be completed, but that the electromechanical works would remain suspended and the dam would not be flooded until a final agreement had been reached. GENISA complained that it had been left out of the agreement and that the agreement violated the agreements concluded by the state with the company. In September 2015 the environmental agency ANAM imposed a 775,200 USD fine on GEMISA for having failed to comply with the resettlement and compensation measures under the project. On January 21, 2016 the indigenous movement 10th of April claimed that the agreement had been violated, because tests to fill the reservoir had been made. On January 28, 2016, a technical report was presented to the indigenous communities, showing that the dam was technically safe. Furthermore, a sub-commission consisting of the government and traditional authorities was created to further study the impacts of the project in view of a \\"final decision\\". Filling of the reservoir began on May 24th, leading to further protests and road blocks. In response, Vice-President and Minister of Foreign Affairs Isabel Saint Malo de Alvarado held talks with indigenous leaders early June 2016. Carrera said that the filling \\"was a violation of the rights of indigenous people in the area, and of the contract signed by President Juan Carlos Varela.\\" See also * List of power stations in Panama  References  Dams in Panama Hydroelectric power stations in Panama Buildings and structures in Chiriqu√≠ Province Roller-compacted concrete dams ","title":"Barro Blanco Dam"},{"id":"36046862","text":"Chieko Sugawara (; born 15 August 1976) is a Japanese fencer.

The main section between Landau and Zweibr√ºcken was opened on 25 November 1875 after the first sections had already been opened between 1857 and 1867. Although the Landau‚ÄìRohrbach railway was once a major east‚Äìwest route for freight and was used for long-distance transport, the line is now used exclusively for regional passenger services. Marketing names The alternate name of Queichtalbahn takes its name from the Queich river, which the line follows from Landau to Hauenstein. The line between Landau and Zweibr√ºcken was built as a single line for the purposes of rail operations and was initially called the S√ºdpfalzbahn or S√ºdpfalz-strecke (Southern Palatinate railway or line), or occasionally the Queichtalbahn. Both terms are geographically somewhat misleading, as the line only runs through the Queich valley from Landau until shortly before Hauenstein and only the section from Landau to Hinterweidenthal is located within the Southern Palatinate. Since 1994 the line has been split in the Deutsche Bahn timetable into two sections, east and west of Pirmasens Nord, the term Queichtalbahn is now mainly used for the eastern section from Landau to Pirmasens Nord,Heilmann/Schreiner 2005, p 153 while the western part is often called the Schwarzbachtalbahn (Schwarzbach Valley Railway) as the line runs from Pirmasens Nord to Zweibr√ºcken through the valley of the Schwarzbach. Route The Landau‚ÄìRohrbach railway begins in Landau Central Station (Landau (Pfalz) Hauptbahnhof). After leaving the station, it branches off the Palatine Maximilian Railway to the left and runs around the city of Landau in a wide arc. In the latter, it stops at Landau (Pfalz) West station and Godramstein station. It then runs along the Queich valley through the S√ºdliche Weinstra√üe district. Between Godramstein and Albersweiler, it runs through the Palatinate wine region and crosses the German Wine Route at a level crossing next to Siebeldingen-Birkweiler station. After Albersweiler, it runs through the Palatinate Forest (Pf√§lzerwald) to Hinterweidenthal on the northern edge of the Wasgau, which lies between the southern Palatinate Forest and the northern Vosges. It runs through the Annweiler and a landscape called the Dahner Felsenland, which has bizarre sandstone cliffs, castles on rocks, notably the ‚Äútrinity castles‚Äù (Burgdreifaltigkeit) of Trifels, Anebos and M√ºnz near Annweiler and rock formations between Rinnthal and Wilgartswiesen. In Wilgartswiesen, the Landau‚ÄìRohrbach railway leaves the Queich valley and runs through the Hinterweidenthal, a narrow depression that separates the Wasgau and the Middle Palatinate Forest, and it now passes through the S√ºdwestpfalz district. After Hinterweidenthal Ost station, the Wieslauter Railway branches off to Bundenthal-Rumbach; it only operates from May to October on Sundays and public holidays. The Landau‚ÄìRohrbach railway leaves the Wasgau here and passes through the Gr√§fensteiner Land, the southwestern part of the Middle Palatinate Forest, running under the main watershed of the Palatinate through the M√ºnchweiler tunnel. The railway then runs along the Rodalb river through M√ºnchweiler an der Rodalb and after passing through the Neuhof tunnel to the town of Rodalben. Arriving at the western edge of the Palatinate forest, the line reaches the railway junction of Pirmasens Nord (formerly Bieberm√ºhle). From Thaleischweiler-Fr√∂schen to Zweibr√ºcken, the line crosses the predominantly agriculturally dominated Westricher plateau. It runs through many curves through the Schwarzbach valley, which is located between rolling hills; the valley floor is mostly used as grazing land and its slopes are reserved for forests. Shortly before the confluence of the Schwarzbach with the Blies, it passed through Zweibr√ºcken Central Station. It then crosses the state border with Saarland at Ein√∂d and now runs through the Saar-Palatinate district. Between Ein√∂d and Blieskastel-Lautzkirchen it passes through the broad lowlands of the Blies, which is mainly covered by meadows and pastures. From Lautzkirchen it follows the wooded W√ºrzbach valley, which separates the Kirkeler forest from the plateau of Bliesgau, which has a more open landscape character. It passes the W√ºrzbach pond (Niederw√ºrzbacher Weiher), a major regional centre for tourism and finally runs through Hassel to Rohrbach, where it meets the Palatine Ludwig Railway from Homburg. After a few kilometres St. Ingbert is reached. History=Planning and construction (1844‚Äì1875) Zweibr√ºcken‚ÄìEin√∂d and Bierbach‚ÄìSaarbr√ºcken sections= Historically, the Landau‚ÄìRohrbach railway is an amalgamation of several lines. The oldest part is the Ein√∂d‚ÄìZweibr√ºcken section, which was created as part of the Blies Valley Railway (), a branch line from Homburg to Zweibrucken. In 1844, a committee was formed in Zweibr√ºcken to promote a branch line from Homburg. Initially this project, however, met with resistance in both cities. Fears were raised that it would seriously damage trade and commerce in Homburg. In Zweibr√ºcken the reservations were based on the fear that the town would now be exposed to considerable smoke pollution. Bierbach station building opened in 1867 Once the Palatine Ludwig Railway was completed from Ludwigshafen to Bexbach, the railway engineer Paul Camille von Denis considered the plans and concluded that a line from Homburg to Zweibr√ºcken would be profitable. Construction work began the line to Zweibr√ºcken via Schwarzenacker on 1 June 1856 and the line was opened on 7 May 1857. The Ludwig Railway was extended during 1866 and 1867 from Schwarzenacker to St. Ingbert via Bierbach. =Landau‚ÄìZweibr√ºcken section= Early efforts were made to promote the building of a line from Zweibr√ºcken to Landau; there was support for this especially in the towns in the Queich valley. The Palatinate Railway (Pfalzbahn) at first rejected this proposal because it opposed competition with the Palatine Ludwig Railway and it considered the construction of the section through the Palatinate Forest would be very costly. However, the Queich valley communities did not give up and continued to campaign for the construction of such a link. It would especially benefit Annweiler, which had growing industries, but the towns and villages between Landau and Annweiler would also benefit from a rail link. Against this background, the planning committee initially considered, as an alternative solution, the establishment of a branch line from Landau to Annweiler. Then, however, the committee acceded to pressure from the city of Landau and also strongly supported the construction of a line from Landau to Zweibr√ºcken. This time its efforts were successful: the committee was authorised to prepare a suitable design, but it had to finance this work itself. The necessary concession was issued on 1 April 1865. There were disagreements over the route between Pirmasens and Zweibrucken, which were eventually reflected in two different designs. The first draft favoured a new line directly via Hengsberg, while the second option was an alignment through Walshausen and along the Trualbe through Hornbach and Ixheim. More detailed studies, however, led to the conclusion that it would be difficult to build a direct southern Palatinate line via Pirmasens on either route due to the difficult topography. Therefore, a new approach was developed, with the line running a few kilometres north of the city. It would, coming from the east, initially run through the valley of the Rodalb and then follow the Schwarzbach. This route had the advantage of only having a slight slope to overcome and only requiring one tunnel, the Neuhof Tunnel near Rodalben. First, the Landau‚ÄìAnnweiler section was built, partly over sections of the Albersweiler Canal, which had been built in the late 17th century, and operations started on 12 September 1874. As early as 25 November 1875, the line was extended to Zweibr√ºcken and connected to the link to the Palatine Ludwig Railway.R√§ntzsch 1997, p. 18 Conceptually, it was a direct continuation of the Germersheim‚ÄìLandau railway and the official chainage (distance markings) run in sequence over both routes. At the same time, a branch line was opened from Bieberm√ºhle station, which is located at the confluence of the Rodalb with the Schwarzenbach, to Pirmasens. In addition, the original Zweibr√ºcken station was not in an appropriate location for a through station and it had to be so moved to its present location. Although the line was initially built as a single track, its track base, engineering structures and crossings were designed to be duplicated. Development for the main east-west link (1875‚Äì1945) Realignment of the western part of the line in 1895 Pirmasens Nord (then Bieberm√ºhle) station in 1900 After the Bruhrain Railway (Bruhrainbahn) between Bruchsal and Rheinsheim had been extended to Germersheim in May 1877, the now continuous connection became one of the major freight routes in Germany,R√§ntzsch 1997, p. 6 carrying mainly coal and iron from the Saar region to the industrial centres of the upper Rhine and southern Germany.Daniel H√§berle, 1913, p. 76 In contrast, passenger traffic played a minor role in the first few years. But this changed in the late 1880s, because now in addition to local trains, national and even international long-distance trains used the line.Daniel H√§berle, 1913, p. 75 From 1890, the Queichtalbahn included long-distance trains on the Munich‚ÄìStuttgart‚ÄìBruchsal‚ÄìGermersheim‚ÄìLandau‚ÄìBieberm√ºhle (now Pirmasens Nord)‚ÄìZweibr√ºcken‚ÄìRohrbach‚ÄìSt. Ingbert‚ÄìSaarbr√ºcken route. This high traffic density made it necessary to increase the capacity of the line, so that was the line from Landau to Bierbach was continuously duplicated from 1887. The existing Hasseler Tunnel, which was opened in 1867 between Hassel and St. Ingbert, had over the years developed more and more structural defects, so that it could be operated at low speed for safety reasons. It was also quite small, with a width of 3.08 metres and a clear height of 4.44 metres. Above all, the military criticised the condition of the tunnel, since it was a bottleneck and thus was not sufficient to ensure, if necessary, the rapid transport of troops and ordnance to France. For this reason, an approximately 2.5 kilometre-long deviation was built between Hassel and St. Ingbert and taken into operation in September 1895, which also made to relocation of Hassel station necessary. The direct connection from Hassel to St. Ingbert was closed and dismantled, and all trains ran from that date ran on the new link between Hassel and Rohrbach. Also in 1904 a further shortening of Palatine Ludwig Railway was put into operation, running via Kirkel and Limbach. These changes had the effect of making the Rohrbach‚ÄìEin√∂d‚ÄìZweibr√ºcken line part of the South Palatine Railway from Landau to Saarbr√ºcken. On 1 December 1911, a branch of the Landau‚ÄìRohrbach railway, the Wieslauter Railway (Wieslauterbahn) was opened on the Hinterweidenthal‚ÄìDahn‚ÄìBundenthal-Rumbach route. From that time, the Bundenthaler service operated on this line on Sundays, starting in Ludwigshafen am Rhein, then running on the Palatine Ludwig Railway (Ludwigshafen‚ÄìNeustadt), and the Palatine Maximilian Railway (Neustadt‚ÄìLandau) and from Landau to Hinterweidenthal over the Landau‚ÄìRohrbach railway. A new junction station called Hinterweidenthal was opened specifically for this new line, while the existing Hinterweidenthal-Kaltenbach station was renamed Kaltenbach. In another name change carried out in 1936, the former station of Bieberm√ºhle was renamed Pirmasens Nord, although it is several kilometres away from Pirmasens, and is not even within the municipality‚Äôs boundaries. In addition, the performance of the line was improved with technical innovations, including at Zweibr√ºcken station, which acquired two electro-mechanical signal boxes in 1940. Gradual loss of significance (Deutsche Bundesbahn 1945‚Äì1993) Landau station building opened after the Second World War As a result of German defeat in World War II, there was an initial decline of the Landau‚ÄìRohrbach railway when the second track of the line was removed between 1945 and 1948 as part of German reparations during the French occupation.Holzborn, p. 115 Also affecting the development of the Southern Palatinate line was the electrification of the Palatine Ludwig Railway, which took place in the years 1960‚Äì1964. Especially in the Kaiserslautern‚ÄìNeustadt section, the difficult topography (including many tunnels) meant that this work required single-track operations and speed restrictions so that the capacity of the line was limited. For this reason, during the same period freight traffic was diverted over the Queichtalbahn, so that there was an initial increase of traffic on the line. However, this changed with the completion of electrification work in 1964. The freight on the Queichtalbahn declined rapidly as it now largely ran over the much higher-capacity Palatine Ludwig Railway. For passengers, the line regained some of its importance for the operation of long-distance trains, especially from Saarbr√ºcken to southern Germany, because the line is somewhat shorter that the Palatine Ludwig Railway. In this context, Landau also received a new station building, as the old building was very badly damaged during the war. The centenary of the line in 1975 was celebrated with steam train services, among other things. These improvements were countered in the 1980s and 1990s by other developments that led to a further decline of the Queichtalbahn. Initial losses occurred from 1981 when the stations of Rodalben, Hauenstein, Rinnthal and Landau West were gradually downgraded in status to halts (Haltepunkten) and their station buildings became unavailable for passengers and staff. Albersweiler station was abandoned and was replaced by a more favourably located halt. In 1982, the 125th anniversary of the connection between Zweibr√ºcken and Homburg, was celebrated with a visit by a Trans-Europ-Express. However, three years later this line was closed. These rationalisation measures at first had no effect on the passenger traffic between Rohrbach and Landau. Thus, from 31 May 1985, regular-interval express trains ran at two-hour intervals on the Queichtalbahn on the Saarbr√ºcken‚ÄìStuttgart, Saarbr√ºcken‚ÄìMunich, Saarbr√ºcken‚ÄìKarlsruhe, Saarbr√ºcken‚ÄìBasel Badischer Bahnhof and the Berchtesgaden‚ÄìSaarbr√ºcken routes. Trains had to reverse in Landau to run on the Palatine Maximilian Railway towards Karlsruhe and Munich. Subsequently, however, there was a continuous reduction in long-distance services on this route, which ultimately led to the end of long-distance services. For example, in 1988, the last D-Zug express running on the Queichtalbahn from Saarbr√ºcken to Stuttgart and Munich was abandoned so that between Landau and Rohrbach only local trains and semi-fast trains operated. In addition, the semi-fast trains only ran as far as Stuttgart, sometimes only to Karlsruhe. Further restrictions occurred particularly in 1991: the former semi-fast trains were replaced by regional express trains (Regionalschnellbahnen), which basically ran just to Karlsruhe. Additionally, the connecting curve between Ein√∂d and Homburg was removed in the same year. This rationalisation culminated in 1993, with Deutsche Bundesbahn's railway division of Saarbr√ºcken developing plans to abandon the Annweiler‚ÄìPirmasens section permanently. Developments under Deutsche Bahn since 1993 After the restructuring of the German railways after the reunification of Germany, the proposed rationalisation described above was postponed. Although the plans for the complete closure of the line were not realised, rail service were further reduced. Already in 1994, the focus was on developing regional rapid transit, so inter-regional passenger services disappeared and the line finally became a purely regional line. At the same time it was in divided into two sections in the railway timetable, the Pirmasens‚ÄìSaarbr√ºcken section was now listed as table (KBS) 674 (Schwarzbachtalbahn, \\"Schwarzbach Valley Railway\\") and the Pirmasens‚ÄìLandau section appeared as KBS 675 (Queichtalbahn, \\"Queich Valley Railway\\"). From 1997, it was attempted to make the Queichtalbahn more attractive for different customer groups, especially for tourist-oriented services. As part of this program, the Rosengartenexpress service was introduced in 1997; it operated on Sundays and public holidays as an excursion train from Landau to Zweibr√ºcken and was categorised as a Regional-Express. Here, the name referred to Zweibr√ºcken's Rosengarten (rose garden), which is a nationally-known landmark. However, the operation of the Rosengartenexpress train was abandoned two years later due to low utilisation. In the same year, on 1 July 1997, regular services resumed on the Wieslauter Railway. In the meantime, the abandoned Hinterweidenthal station was reactivated and was given the new name of Hinterweidenthal Ost. Rinnthal station modernised in 2007 In September 2000, the 125th anniversary of the Queich Valley Railway was celebrated with steam train services operated by the Ulm Railway Society (Ulmer Eisenbahnfreunde, UEF), so the Queich Valley Railway came back into the public consciousness. The infrastructure of the line has been modernised over the years. In April 2010, an electronic interlocking was installed in Landau; since then signalling and switching at Landau station and Godramstein station have been remotely controlled from Neustadt. In the near future, the trains on the Queichtalbahn will be coupled (or uncoupled) in Landau with the Regional- Express trains on the Neustadt‚ÄìKarlsruhe line to provide a transfer-free connection to and from Karlsruhe. Since 11 December 2011, the new Zweibr√ºcken- Rosengarten station has been served by regular passenger services. In this context, the Public Transport Association of Rhineland-Palatinate South (Zweckverband SchienenPersonenNahVerkehr Rheinland-Pfalz S√ºd) is planning to open Annweiler-Sarnstall station in June 2012. Operations=Passenger services The Landau‚ÄìRohrbach railway was for decades part of the east-west Saarbr√ºcken‚ÄìBruchsal route, which was used in 1939 by trains running to/from Munich on timetable route 242, along with other services. After the Second World War, it gradually lost long-distance services. The route is now operated by Deutsche Bahn. Its western section is part of timetable (KBS) route 674: Saarbr√ºcken‚ÄìPirmasens, while the eastern section forms KBS route 675: Landau‚ÄìPirmasens. Since December 2010 it is operated mainly with class 642 (Siemens Desiro) diesel multiple units, replacing class 643 (Bombardier Talent) DMUs on the Saarbr√ºcken‚ÄìPirmasens Nord section and class 628 DMUs on the Landau‚ÄìPirmasens Nord section. The trains in the eastern sector operate mostly at hourly intervals under the Rhineland-Palatinate integrated timetable (Rheinland-Pfalz-Takt) with trains usually crossing in Annweiler and M√ºnchweiler and serving all stations with the exception of Hinterweidenthal Ost. Since 1994, trains reverse in Pirmasens Nord station in order to run along the southern section of the Bieberm√ºhl Railway to Pirmasens Central Station. From 1994 to 1996, the trains operated over the Palatine Maximilian Railway to Neustadt. Since 1994, trains on the western section also run to Pirmasens Central Station, Pirmasens, running to and from Saarbr√ºcken at hourly intervals. Freight  Most freight on the Landau‚ÄìRohrbach railway in its first decades was coal transported from the Saar, but this declined very much over the years and is now completely abandoned. The reduction of the line to single-track for reparations after the Second World War played a major role in the loss of freight. Thus, due to the high number of train crossings on the remaining two-track sections that had been left in stations and the resulting delays to passenger trains, freight trains were increasingly diverted to the Palatine Ludwig Railway. Because of these problems, there has been no freight trains on the eastern part of the line since 1998; before that freight was limited to the Landau‚ÄìWilgartswiesen section. Zweibr√ºcken Central Station once had an extensive system of freight tracks, but these have now been completely dismantled. The John Deere company, which manufactures agricultural equipment, has a factory in Zweibr√ºcken, from which freight trains were loaded with combine harvesters before the traffic converted to road transport. One reason for this move was that the limited clearance of the line prevented viable transportation by rail. In 2002, the last freight loading point on the line at Thaleischweiler-Fr√∂schen was closed; its last customer was the company Reno, a retailer of shoes. Since then, there has been no freight traffic on the line. Notes References * . * .

Part of Hydro's Building Systems division, Technal is present in Europe, Latin America, South Africa. It is engaged in the development, manufacturing and marketing of aluminum glazing systems for commercial, public and residential buildings. History In 1960, Andr√© Bos founded Alusud, designing aluminum window systems. The company was based in Amidonniers, Toulouse in the south west of France. Products included aluminum profiles and anodised sheets. The company worked with glazing companies, metalworkers and locksmiths, enabling the development of shopfront systems in the early 1960s. The business continued to develop in the south of France. In the 1970s, Bos took activity abroad, creating Technal International. By 1986, Technal Export had licensees in Lebanon, South Africa and the Ivory Coast. Exports to the Caribbean, Pacific and Indian ocean regions, West Africa, North Africa, Central America, South America, and Asia followed. A joint venture in Bahrain was established in 2000. In 2002, the Norsk Hydro group bought Technal, and when Hydro merged its aluminium extrusion activities with Sapa's extrusion business in 2013, Technal became part of the new Sapa joint venture. History of the logo Technal logo The Technal logo sympbolises one of its key product components - the 4114 profile. In 1960, the first logo showed the company name \\"Alusud\\", the \\"A\\" becoming a stylised graphic in 1966. When the company opened overseas in 1970, the name and the graphic representation of the 4114 profile were brought together to form a new logo and the emblem of the Technal system; Alusud became known as Technal. In 1983 the brand and logo were brought together and two years later, a new graphic was created and became internationally widespread. In 1995, the graphic identity of Technal was redesigned to represent the much evolved business. Activities Technal markets its products through aluminum glazing companies. It has a network of certified installers ‚Äì \\"Technal Aluminier\\" network - in France, Spain and Portugal to ensure fabrication and installation quality, and compliance with standards and regulations. Technal also works with architects, contractors and building owners directly on projects from design to completion. The main product categories are aluminium doors, sliding windows, casement windows, balustrades, curtain walling. The headquarters in Toulouse (France) has a product development and research centre which carries out prototype manufacture and testing, and product testing. Technal offers laboratory testing to verify compliance with European and international standards, and product performance, for both internal requirements and external certification bodies. Technal also works for the recycling of its products in factories. Technal worldwide Technal in the world Technal is present in Europe (Belgium, United Kingdom, Ireland, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Portugal) and in over 70 countries.

Founded in 1966 by John La Rose and Sarah White, it was the first Caribbean publishing house in England. New Beacon Books was widely recognized as having played an important role in the Caribbean Artists Movement, and in Black British culture more generally. The associated George Padmore Institute (GPI) is located in the same building where the bookshop resides at 76 Stroud Green Road, Finsbury Park, London.  History  New Beacon Books started out as a publishing house that was run out of the Hornsey, North London, flat of John La Rose and Sarah White. It was named after the Trinidadian journal The Beacon, which was published between 1931 and 1932. In 1967, La Rose and White moved New Beacon Books to new premises, in Finsbury Park, where the company also began to function as a specialist bookstore. Early publications included Foundations by John La Rose (1966), Tradition, the Writer and Society: Critical Essays by Wilson Harris (1967), and a new edition of John Jacob Thomas's 1889 study, Froudacity (1969). Other notable works published by New Beacon Books include: Edward Kamau Brathwaite, History of the Voice: The Development of Nation Language in the Anglophone Caribbean (1984); Jane and Louisa Will Soon Come Home (1980) and Myal (1988) by Erna Brodber; Martin Carter, Poems of Succession (1977); Lorna Goodison, I am Becoming my Mother (1986); Mervyn Morris, The Pond (1973) and Shadowboxing (1979); and Andrew Salkey, A Quality of Violence (1978). The 50th anniversary of New Beacon was celebrated with a series of events held during the latter part of 2016,Palmer, Carl (15 August 2016), \\"UK's First Black Publisher And Bookshop Celebrates 50th Year\\", The Voice. including an International Poetry Night on 3 December internationally acclaimed poet and GPI Trustee Linton Kwesi Johnson at the British Library.\\"Beacon of hope: The tiny bookshop that gave a big voice to black writers\\", BBC ‚Äì Arts, 6 December 2016. In late 2016, the directors of the bookshop decided to close it down on the grounds that it was no longer economically viable. A particular problem was that it lacked a functional website, and was losing its specialist niche to online booksellers. The physical setup had not essentially changed since the 1980s. It closed in February 2017. However, a volunteer New Beacon Development Group swiftly reopened the shop with reduced hours and set about gathering support. Crowdfunding raised ¬£11,248, which helped the shop to undertake a major refurbishment and create a website, permitting online browsing and shopping. The renovations were completed in August 2017 and normal hours were reestablished.

It was founded by Limor Fried in 2005. The company designs, manufactures and sells a number of electronics products, electronics components, tools and accessories. It also produces a number of learning resources, including live and recorded videos related to electronics, technology, and programming. History Limor Fried, then a student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, began selling electronic kits on her website from her own designs in 2005. She later moved to New York City and established Adafruit Industries. In 2010, Adafruit offered a reward for whoever could hack Microsoft's Kinect to make its motion sensing capabilities available for use for other projects. This reward was increased to $2,000 and then $3,000 following Microsoft's concerns about tampering. The company had $22 million in revenue in 2013 and $33 million in 2014.  Company name The name Adafruit comes from Fried's online moniker \\"Ladyada\\", itself a homage to computer science pioneer Ada Lovelace. The company's goal is to get more people involved in technology, science and engineering. Products In addition to distributing third party components and boards such as the Raspberry Pi, Adafruit develops and sells its own development boards for educational and hobbyist purposes. In 2016, the company released the Circuit Playground, a board with an Atmel ATmega32u4 microcontroller and a variety of sensors, followed in 2017 by the more powerful Atmel SAMD21 based Circuit Playground Express. They, like many Adafruit products, are circular in shape for ease of use in education and wearable electronics projects, along with the FLORA and Gemma, the companies wearable electronics development platforms. In 2017, Adafruit Industries best selling product was the Circuit Playground Express NeoPixel Mini NeoPixels with comparison to a alt= Adafruit Mini NeopixelsNeoPixel is Adafruit's brand of individually-addressable red-green-blue (RGB) LED. They are based on the WS2812 LED and WS2811 driver, where the WS2811 is integrated into the LED, for reduced footprint. Adafruit manufactures several products with NeoPixels with form factors such as strips, rings, matrices, Arduino shields, traditional five-millimeter cylinder LED and individual NeoPixel with or without a PCB. The control protocol for NeoPixels is based on only one communication wire. Adafruit provides an Arduino library and a Python Library to help with the programming of NeoPixels. In addition to the traditional RGB technology, Adafruit manufactures a red-green-blue-white (RGBW) variant of NeoPixel for all products except those that feature a NeoPixel Mini 3535. Those integrate an additional white LED in the package for extra possible color mixes and selectable white color temperature (the company sells single NeoPixels with a 6000K, 4500K and 3000K color temperature). CircuitPython In January, 2017, Adafruit introduced CircuitPython, a fork of the MicroPython programming language optimized to run on select Adafruit products. CircuitPython currently runs on Adafruit boards with a flash memory chip and one of the following microcontrollers: Atmel SAMD21 (M0), Atmel SAMD51 (M4), and the Nordic Semiconductor nRF52840. In 2019, resources for CircuitPython were moved to circuitpython.org, a move to show that the number of third-party boards using CircuitPython had grown beyond those only manufactured by Adafruit. This includes both CircuitPython for microcontrollers and CircuitPython on single-board computers using a compatibility layer Adafruit named 'Blinka', to access general-purpose input/output functionality and compatibility with a library of over 160 sensors and drivers. Feather development boards alt= Adafruit Feather M0 Basic Proto Development Board The Feather development boards constitute Adafruit's broadest platform of \\"Arduino-like\\" boards. The boards all share similarities in that they have the same form factor, same pinout, similar microcontrollers, feature lithium polymer battery charging. Each board has a special feature in addition to the microcontroller breakout, such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or cellular network connectivity or built-in prototyping space or SD card communication. The name \\"Feather\\" comes from the fact that the boards are small, thin, light and easily powered from a battery. In addition to the boards themselves, Adafruit engineers and manufactures \\"FeatherWings\\", which are expansion cards allowing the addition of features such as an LCD, a NeoPixel array or DC motor drivers. Adafruit Learning System In addition to manufacturing and selling electronic devices, Adafruit regularly publishes tutorials featuring their products. The tutorials show how to build projects, highlighting their products' abilities and strengths. The site hosts close to 1600 guides and articles written by collaborators. The guides range from teardowns of existing wearable electronic devices to 3D printing projects to overview and introduction of Adafruit merchandise and how to build projects. Presence on YouTube Adafruit Industries has a substantial presence on the online video streaming website YouTube. The channel has been active since April 2, 2006. The company was awarded a YouTube Silver Play Button in August 2015 for having surpassed 100,000 subscribers. Adafruit creates different types of videos, all on electronics, with most featuring one of their products. Each week for at least six years, several live shows have been streamed. Ask an Engineer This weekly show was started in 2010 in Fried's living room. The concept was that viewers could ask her questions about engineering while she was assembling an electronics kit and Phillip Torrone, her spouse, was preparing shipments. The show is broadcast on YouTube with behind-the-scenes content available on Discord. The company states that this is the longest-running live electronics show. Some of the sections of the stream are new products where Fried demonstrates new products; Time Travel, where the hosts look back on the world of makers, hackers, artists and engineers and often highlight a special person or event; 3D Printing, where they showcase a special project or product related to the industry; a Q&A; session; and a trivia question, where the first viewer with the correct answer wins a product. There is sometimes a section dedicated to Raspberry Pi and Arduino news and a section where the hosts read a positive email they have received. Each week, a coupon code, which is valid for the night, provides a 10% rebate on everything available from the store except for gift certificates and software. The show airs on Wednesdays at 8PM ET on the company's YouTube channel and is still run by Limor Fried and Phillip Torrone, with guests often present. As of February 2016, there have been almost 200 editions of the show, totalling almost 7 million minutes watched, a half million video views and 33 thousand playlist views. Show-and-Tell Show- and-Tell is Adafruit's live show where makers from all around the world share electronic projects they are currently working on. The show is first broadcast at 7:30PM ET on Wednesdays, and runs for 30 minutes. It is hosted by Limor Fried and Phillip Torrone and uses the Google+ Hangouts platform. Over the four years that it has been running, Show-and-Tell has been produced more than 200 times, collecting more than 2.8 million minutes watched, about 500,000 video views and with 27,000 playlist views. 3D Hangouts with Noe and Pedro Ruiz 3D Hangouts with Noe and Pedro Ruiz goes over the 3D printing industry (most typically about desktop FDM printers). Every week, on Thursday, a 30-minute edition is released where the two brothers discuss news about the industry, specific projects that they are working on, share 3D printing tips and tricks and answer viewer's questions and comments. They also showcase projects and prints from the online community. The show was started in 2014. John Park's Workshop The weekly John Park's Workshop show is broadcast live from John Edgar Park's workshop as he builds creative technology projects ‚Äì from mystery boxes to ninja timers to synthesizers to coffee robots ‚Äì while teaching viewers the skills to create their own. The creations made by Park demonstrate the weekly project (which is later developed into a tutorial on Adafruit's Learning System), covers fundamental tips and tricks for working with the featured tools and materials, interacts with viewers, and answers questions over chat messaging systems in YouTube and Discord. Wearable Electronics with Becky Stern Wearable Electronics with Becky Stern was Adafruit's live show dedicated to the wearable electronics industry. It was hosted by the American artist Becky Stern. In the show, industry news, projects, techniques and materials were covered and discussed. It aired every Wednesday at 2PM ET and was produced for 122 episodes, from 2013 to 2016. The last edition was streamed on February 10, 2016.

He studied cello at the Royal College of Music later becoming professor of cello at the Royal Academy of Music ‚Äì the start of a teaching career that was to span almost four decades before he retired in 1966 at the age of 75. During the inter-War years he became a prominent player of both chamber and orchestral music; his repertoire included both British and European contemporary music. He recorded for HMV and was broadcast by the BBC. He composed a number of original pieces mostly for solo cello with piano accompaniment. Early life Cedric Sharpe was born in Maida Vale, London, England, in 1891, the son of Herbert Sharpe a professor of piano and composer at the Royal College of Music in London. From the age of seven he studied under Tennyson Werge, a cellist who had performed with his father in London concerts. He continued his studies with the cellist W. H. Squire at the Royal College of Music gaining a scholarship there in 1907 at the age of 16. After completing his studies he left the Royal College of Music in 1912. In 1913 he married Evelyn Blanche Jennings a composer of songs and settings of poems; they had a son and a daughter. Playing career Sharpe became a prominent player of both chamber and orchestral music. In 1914 along with James Lockyer (viola) and the London String Quartet he performed in the first British public performance of Schoenberg's Verkl√§rte Nacht at the Bechstein Hall in London. In 1915 he formed the Philharmonic Quartet with Arthur Beckwith (1st violin), Eugene Aynsley Goossens (2nd violin) and Raymond Jeremy (viola). The First World War interrupted their work as some of the members were called up for service; they re-formed in 1918 with Frederick Holding and Thomas Peatfield as 1st and 2nd violins. The quartet was active until the early 1940s. In 1924 Sharpe founded the Virtuoso Quartet with Marjorie Hayward (1st violin), Edwin Virgo (2nd violin) and Raymond Jeremy (viola). They made frequent tours of the British Isles sometimes forming quintets with other well-known players of the day, for example Leon Goossens (oboe), William Murdoch (piano), Harriet Cohen (piano) or Arnold Bax. In 1926 with Dale Smith (baritone) and Sidonie Goossens (harp) they performed in a BBC concert of contemporary music which included \\"Ode to a Nightingale\\" by Eric Fogg and Aquarelles for string quartet by John Foulds; this was broadcast from the New Chenil Galleries studios in Chelsea over the radio station 2LO. Sharpe was also a member of several other ensembles ‚Äì the Chamber Music Players, the Chamber Music Trio, the English Trio, the Trio Players with Eda Kersey (violin) and Gerald Moore (piano), the Harp Ensemble and the Cedric Sharpe Sextet (formed in 1930) which was broadcast regularly by the BBC in the years leading up to the Second World War. The June 1932 issue of Gramophone magazine commented: > These are all interesting organisations, but one cannot help wishing that > Cedric Sharpe, instead of making up the ensemble of so many different > combinations, would devote himself exclusively to solo work; or, following > the example of the Flonzaley and Lener Quartets, found a quartet whose > members would devote themselves solely to their own organisation. In 1933, the Trio Players along with Enid Cruickshank (contralto) performed three of Schoenberg's lieder: \\"Ewartung\\" and \\"Schenk Mir Deinen Goldenen\\" from Opus 2 and \\"Hochzeitslied\\" from Opus 3. These were broadcast over London Regional along with works solely for trio by Beethoven, Berlioz, Ireland and Schubert. Sharpe also held the following positions as an orchestral player (with approximate dates where known): principal cello for the New Symphony Orchestra (1930s and 1940s), director and principal cello for the London Symphony Orchestra (1930s and 1940s), principal cello with the Royal Albert Hall orchestra and principal cello with the Royal Opera House Covent Garden orchestra (1940s). He played cellos by David Tecchler (dated 1701) and Charles Buthod (dated 1897). Academic career In 1928 Sharpe became professor of cello at the Royal Academy of Music in London. His teaching career was to span nearly 40 years before his retirement in 1966 at the age of 75. He contributed to books about cello technique, for example editing and revising \\"The Violoncello\\" a primer originally written by Jules de Swert in 1920. The cellist Dennis Vigay (born 1926) was amongst Sharpe's pupils. Compositions Sharpe's compositions date mainly from between the two World Wars. He wrote a number of original pieces for cello and piano, a number of arrangements for cello and piano, some original and arranged songs in ballad style and two pieces for light orchestra. His original cello and piano pieces (with dates where known) are: Midsummer Song (1921), Gavotte in G minor (1927), The Angelus (1927), Chansonette (1928), An Old Time Dance (1928), Le Soir (1928), Five Little Solos for Cello and Piano (1928), Romance in A (1929), Valse Capricieuse (1933), An Old World Love Song (1933), Cradle Song (1939), Humoresque Rumbaesque (1939), Petite Valse Lyrique (1950), Nocturne (1951), Pavane, The Vesper Bell (from an old Breton folk tune) and Five Little Songs. His cello and piano arrangements are of music by J. S. Bach and Thomas Arne. He also arranged the following traditional folk tunes: Six Old English Airs (1921), Six Old Irish Airs (1923), Eight Welsh Melodies (1925) and a set of Scottish folk tunes originally arranged for solo piano by his father Herbert Sharpe. His ballad songs (with dates and lyricists where known) are: \\"The year's at the Spring\\" (Robert Browning 1927), \\"The Fairy Fiddler\\" (N. Hopper arranged 1927), \\"Lullaby Song\\" (Gabriel Setoun 1933), \\"Love thy Mother\\", \\"Little One. Prayer.\\" (Thomas Hood 1933), \\"It was the Time of Roses\\" (1933) and \\"In Praise of Ale\\" (1934). His light orchestral pieces are: Suite Pompadour (orchestrated by Hubert Bath 1934) and Holyrood Suite (1935). Recordings Sharpe recorded for HMV starting in 1915 with a number of short pieces for solo cello, for example The Broken Melody by Van Biene (1915), Le Cygne by Camille Saint-Sa√´ns (1916), Roses of Picardy by Haydn Wood (1918) and Salut d'Amour by Edward Elgar (1919). Throughout the 1920s and 1930s he recorded with his ensembles, for example the Virtuoso Quartet recorded Beethoven's quartets in E minor Op. 59 No. 2 (in 1924), C major Op. 59 No. 3 and E-flat major Op. 127. They also recorded the Debussy quartet in G minor Op. 10, the Cesar Franck quartet in D major M.9, the Tchaikovsky No.1 in D major Op. 11 (in 1924) and the Ravel in F major (in 1929).

The game is played by placing a table tennis table against a playing wall with the net remaining on the table perpendicular to the wall. Each player stands on the opposite side of the table facing the wall on either side of an imaginary line as if the net was extended backwards. Players each use table tennis rackets and take turns to play a table tennis ball off the playing wall onto the table on the opponents side of the net, except on serves where the ball must first bounce on the servers side of the net on the table. History The game was created in 2009 (nope! this was actually invented by Jamie Bennet in 2003 whilst he worked at HMP Norwich, at lunch he played table tennis but due to constraints on space he moved the table to the wall as described in the rest of this article p.s stop removing my edit .....Jamie Bennett is the true founder of table squash)in Leeds, United Kingdom.British Pathe. \\"Inspiration in the early origins of table squash\\", British Pathe, 1959. Originally played using a domestic kitchen table, considerably smaller than a table tennis table, the game was created as an alternative to traditional table tennis for locations where there isn't room for a full size table and room to navigate around it. The game originated with few rules as a social occasion to strike a ball around before the initial draft of the official rules was generated in October 2009. Equipment Any standard table tennis bats and balls maybe used, along with a standard sized table tennis table, as prescribed by the International Table Tennis Federation.ITTF. \\"International Table Tennis Federation\\" , ITTF. The table is placed against the wall, the net should be perpendicular to the wall with the regulation 15.25 cm net overhang left as a gap to the wall known as the crack. Rules=Commencing Play Example of Table Squash mid game Play begins by playing for serve.ITSA \\"Table Squash rules, v3\\", [University of Leeds], 5 August 2010. The ball is bounced off one players side of the table, off the wall, off the opposing players side of the table. The opposing player should then strike the ball so that it bounces straight off the wall and back onto the serving players side of the table. The server continues and strikes the ball again directly off the wall onto the opponents side of the table, after this point the point can be won. Winning the point A point is won when the ball does not complete the required sequence of bouncing off the wall and the opponents side of the table. Once this process is completed the turn passes to the opponent. Whomever turn it is upon a point not being completed, either by the ball striking the floor, the table on the wrong side of the net or in the wrong order will lose the point. A turn is not completed if the ball falls down the crack, and the player that played the stroke will lose the point. Serving To serve a player should play the ball off their own side of the table, followed by the wall, followed by the opponents side of the table. Play then continues as normal. The point can be won directly off the serve if the ball is not returned. If the ball touches the net but still completes the required bounces in order a let is called and the serve is replayed. If the required order of bounces is not completed the point is lost by the server. Scoring A player can only score on his own serve, if a player wins the point against the serve they will then take the serve but not score a point. The server is always the player who won the previous point. Games are played as the first to eleven, but in order to win a player must win by 2 points or more, if this is not the case on reaching 11 points, play will continue until one player has a two point lead, this player is the winner of the game. When one player reaches 6 points players should swap sides and continues play, unless an agreement is reached beforehand to remain on the same side throughout the game. Fouls If a player steps on the floor over the imaginary line extending from the net, a foul is called and the offending player loses the point. If a player interferes with another players shot by reaching over the imaginary line a foul is also called. Alternate rules There are several variations on the official rules that are frequently played, major examples of these include; Quick matches Matches are played as first to 5, a format often used to complete mini-tournaments where many matches need to be played. The old rules A term relating to the origins of the game when rules were less defined.ITSA \\"Table Squash rules, v1\\", [University of Leeds], 24 October 2009. In this version of the game, a point is not over until the ball strikes the floor, comes to a complete halt or hits a players racket twice without hitting anything else. This allows players to make multiple hits and allows for longer and more complex rallies, which may feature playing the ball off other obstacles. When playing these rules a judgmental element is included for poor sportsmanship. If a player en devours to play repeated shots in order to set up winning shot, such as repeated hits off the wall whilst positioning themselves in a place to slam the ball in an unreturnable manner, then poor sportsmanship is called and this player forfeits the point. Surfaces Due to the nature of courts being dependent on available conditions, and funding problems preventing any official table squash courts to be purpose built, there are often different features around the court that may influence play. The rules regarding these features should be agreed before commencing play. For example there may be additional walls around the table or a roof in position, typically these surfaces can be played off without a point ending as long as the correct sequence of playing off the scoring wall (the wall perpendicular to the net than the table is placed against) and the opponents side of the net is completed also. If the scoring wall has obstacles on it decision should be made before commencing play whether striking these should constitute a foul. Under official rules all attempts to minimize such obstacles should be made but striking them should not constitute a foul.ITSA \\"ITSA's guidance for social play\\", [University of Leeds], 13 February 2010. Non regulation tables The game can be played on any available rectangular table on which a net may be affixed, gameplay can be altered by using different size tables which alter the available space in which to hit the ball. Alternatively a two piece table can be folded into a right angle. With the net secured to the edge of the horizontal surface and allowing a small gap between the vertical surface. The game then commences making use of the tables centre line as the deliniator for points and serves and continues using the regular table squash rules. Governance The game was founded and the rules created by the International Table Squash Association (ITSA)ITSA \\"International Table Squash Formation - Organisation Guidance and Principles\\", [University of Leeds], 24 October 2009. whom continue to develop the game and create tournaments as well as recognize and ratify non ITSA organised tournaments.ITSA \\"ITSA Tournament Schedule 2012\\", [University of Leeds], 14 December 2011.

The focus of the park is its display of dinosaur models, each with an information board. In addition there are models of prehistoric fish, marine mammals and the odd turtles, hominids, mammoths and sabre-toothed tigers. Simulated archaeological excavations at Dinosaur Land, 2009 The models are made of glass-reinforced plastics (GFP) and are made by hand. At the time of opening there were around 1000 of these models displayed on a roughly 800 metre long circular walk. The largest has a height of twelve metres and a length of 27 metres and represents Diplodocus. In early 2009 the circular walk was extended to 1,100 metres with around 120 exhibits. This expansion had an emphasis on marine life. The park also offers various activities, for example, a simulated archaeological dig on a dinosaur skeleton using shoves and brushes, as well as searching for fossils in the remains of a chalk pit.

The LLP was established in 2004 to take over the practice of Halliwell Landau. Key individuals involved in its management were senior partner Alec Craig and managing partner (then executive chairman) Ian Austin, London office head Clive Garston, Liverpool office head and then managing partner Jonathan Brown, and Sheffield office head Suzanne Liversidge. Insolvency On 20 July 2010, the High Court made an order putting Halliwells into administration. Dermot Power and Shay Bannon of BDO LLP were appointed administrators. Halliwells' practice was sold as a pre-packaged insolvency to four other firms: Hill Dickinson, Barlow Lyde & Gilbert, Gateley, and Kennedys. At the time, this was the largest English law firm to go into administration. The administrators initially blamed market conditions and high rents for the firm's failure. An additional factor behind the firm's failure was a property transaction connected to Halliwells' decision to become an anchor tenant in the Spinningfields business development in Manchester. The firm received a reverse premium of ¬£20 million from the landlord, which was shared between the firm's 32 equity partners, who each took between ¬£250,000 and ¬£1 million. This was kept secret from the junior partners. The administrators have sued the 32 recipients and have alleged that Halliwells‚Äô equity partners altered the minutes of a meeting about the reverse premium before passing them on to the rest of the firm. There has been an attempt to resolve the dispute by mediation. Ian Austin and Suzanne Liversidge have each spoken publicly about Halliwells' failure and denied any personal responsibility. In March 2012, 36 of the former junior partners who were not told about the reverse premium threatened to sue the 32 equity partners who took the ¬£20 million.

Career George Hugh Wyndham was educated at Harrow School and Exeter College, Oxford and entered the Diplomatic Service in 1857. He accompanied Sir Frederick Bruce to China in 1859 and stayed there for two years. He then served as consul-general at Warsaw and subsequently as Secretary of the legations or embassies at Athens, Madrid, St Petersburg and Constantinople (where in 1883 it fell to him, as Charg√© d'Affaires to the Sublime Porte, to sign a declaration amending the convention for the suppression of the slave trade that had been agreed between the UK government and the Sultan of Turkey in 1880). Wyndham was promoted to be Minister Resident to the King of Serbia in 1885 and upgraded to Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary in the following year. In 1888 he was moved to be minister to Brazil and remained there until mid-1894. During this period he witnessed a bloodless military coup on November 1889 that overthrew the Empire of Brazil, exiled the last Emperor, Pedro II and established a republic. However, British citizens and property in Brazil were not at risk and although Britain did not yet recognise the new republic, Wyndham remained in Rio de Janeiro maintaining unofficial relations with the new government until December 1890 when he returned to England on \\"leave of absence\\"Court Circular, The Times, 23 Dec 1890, p7 until May 1891 when the UK government established full diplomatic relations with the provisional government of the United States of Brazil. Wyndham was still at Rio when the second Brazilian Naval Revolt broke out in September 1893. During the six-month revolt Wyndham and the US ambassador, Thomas L. Thompson, generally maintained British and American neutrality although the presence of Royal Navy and US Navy warships prevented the rebels from achieving a blockade of Rio harbour.Joseph Smith, Illusions of Conflict: Anglo-American Diplomacy Toward Latin America, 1865‚Äì1896, University of Pittsburgh Press, 1979, page 162-184 In September 1894 Wyndham was given his final appointment as Minister to Romania at Bucharest. He retired from the Diplomatic Service in 1897 and returned to his family's estate at Rogate, Sussex, where among other things he was a Justice of the Peace, and died there in 1916. Hugh Wyndham was appointed CB in 1878 for his services in Athens during the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878) and knighted KCMG in 1894 for his work in Brazil. Family Hugh Wyndham was a son of Charles Wyndham, an illegitimate son of George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont. In 1863 Hugh Wyndham married his cousin, Charlotte Scott.

The name is derived from the Greek meaning an increase in the number of cells in an animal. History This genus was created in 1948 when Neitz and Thomas proposed the name Cytauxzoon to accommodate the Theileria like parasites with preerythrocytic schizogony in histiocytes. This is in contrast to schizogony in lymphocytes with the latter being characteristic for Theileria. This genus was originally described in African ruminants but is now known to be common in felids including the domestic cat (Felis catus). It was first described in the African grey duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia). C. felis was first described by Kier in 1979. Taxonomy This genus is closely related to Theileria but differs from it by replicating in macrophages rather than lymphocytes. Description=Life cycle The parasites are transmitted by tick bite. After a cat or other host is bitten by an infected tick the parasites infect mononuclear phagocytes. Within these they undergo asexual reproduction (schizonts). As these leukocytes become engorged with schizonts, they line the lumens of veins and may causing obstruction of blood flow. The schizonts develop into merozoites which eventually cause host cell rupture and enter the blood. These intravascular merozoites infect variable numbers of erythrocytes. An infected host is then bitten by a tick. The parasites undergo sexual reproduction in the tick's gut. Microscopic appearances The intra erythrocytic forms range in size between 0.8‚Äì2.3 ¬µm within a mean of 1.64 ¬µm.

Interactive Entertainment for the Nintendo 3DS, Wii U, Microsoft Windows, iOS and Android. The game was announced during Nintendo's E3 2012 press conference on June 5, 2012. It is the fourth title in the Scribblenauts series. It was a launch title for the Wii U console. Gameplay The core fundamentals of the gameplay in Scribblenauts Unlimited are similar to previous entries in the series. Maxwell returns as the player character and the objective is still to collect Starites by using objects the player creates to complete various tasks. Scribblenauts Unlimited is more adventure-based than Scribblenauts and Super Scribblenauts. One of the primary differences with this game is that it takes place in a large overworld that is open to exploration, as opposed to the first two games in the series, where the player had to choose an individual puzzle to earn Starites. Players can traverse different themed areas and accept challenges from NPCs. Sometimes, this will transport the player to a self-contained level, much like earlier Scribblenauts titles, where the player must solve multiple puzzles before being awarded with a Starite. There are now also smaller challenges within the world that reward the player with Starite shards - collecting ten of these shards is another way to earn Starites. There are also male and female versions of all NPCs (including animals) now, as well as new functions for the time and arcade machines. Due to the additional power of the Wii U, a budget meter is no longer present allowing up to 60 objects to be displayed at the same time. The game was built on an upgraded version of the Objectnaut engine, providing the player with several additional options when creating objects. As well as the adjective system that was introduced in Super Scribblenauts, players can now attach multiple objects to each other; for example, creating a dog with wheels. Furthermore, there are numerous properties that can be assigned to objects, such as movement and offensive capabilities. Players can also customize their objects with scaling and coloring tools, similar to another 5th Cell franchise, Drawn to Life. Customized objects can be named and saved - typing in the name of a saved custom object allows it to be spawned at any time. According to game designer Jeremiah Slaczka, the Wii U version of the game can store more than 900 custom objects. The 3DS version lacks this object editor, due to technological constraints. Version differences The Nintendo 3DS version of Scribblenauts Unlimited does not feature the object editor heavily promoted in advertisements for the game. Instead, it features communications via the 3DS's StreetPass and SpotPass communication modes. In addition, the iOS and Android versions do not include an object editor. The Wii U version of Scribblenauts Unlimited contains a local multiplayer mode, as well as online support that allows players to share and download each others‚Äô creations custom-made in the object editor with the community. Each player can store up to 900 objects, whether made by the player or downloaded from the community. However, any player other than the first player in the local multiplayer mode of the game can not summon objects themselves. The Wii U version is the first game of the Scribblenauts series to be released on a home console. As a result, the game has been given a revamped high-definition visual style. The Wii U version also has exclusive cameo objects of characters and items from the Super Mario and Legend of Zelda games, which later returned in the European release of both Wii U and 3DS versions. The Microsoft Windows version of Scribblenauts Unlimited is integrated with Steam Workshop to share custom objects within the community. The iOS and Android versions feature revised touch controls suitable for multi-touch capacitive touchscreens, such as pinching to zoom in/out.Google Play Original soundtrack The music of Scribblenauts Unlimited was composed by David J. Franco. The game consists of 30 primary level tracks, only 28 of which appear in the game in their original composed form. The majority of tracks have two remixes that were created by Tracy W. Bush, one with an exaggerated bass line and new beat arrangements, and one with the primary drum tracks stripped out. In addition to these 50 remix tracks, there are three menu tracks, two tracks for special case objects, two musical scores for the intro/outro, and three unused tracks. This brings the grand total to 90 unique tracks produced for the game. Below are the 28 original songs, listed based on the level in which they first appear. Some songs appear on multiple levels, and each level has a rotating set of three songs. *\\"Title\\" aka Classroom *\\"Edwin's Farm\\" *\\"Capital City\\" aka Downtown *\\"The Under Line\\" aka Subway *\\"Punctuation Plaza\\" *\\"Capital City Runoff\\" aka Ocean Deep *\\"Hyphen Heights\\" aka Suburbia *\\"Full Stop Diner\\" aka Restaurant *\\"Metaforest\\" aka Woods *\\"Grave Manor\\" aka Haunted House *\\"The Virgule Gallery\\" aka Grotto *\\"Sir Guillemet's Castle\\" *\\"Ruins of Ellipsis\\" aka Rainforest *\\"Anaphora Falls\\" aka River *\\"Bullet Point Bayou\\" aka Swamp *\\"The Listy Colon\\" aka Ocean *\\"Payper Plains\\" aka Grasslands *\\"Payper N.

In the opening scene, narrated by Lily (Jennifer Hale), Maxwell‚Äôs sister, the player learns that Maxwell's parents were travellers who later semi-retired and had 42 children. They gave Maxwell and Lily a magical notebook that can create any object by writing its respective word in it. Maxwell's parents show concern that he and Lily are becoming spoiled, however. One day, Maxwell comes across an old man who appears to be hungry. As a prank, Maxwell uses his notebook to create a rotten apple, and gives it to the man. Angered, the old man scolds Maxwell for being spoiled and places a curse on Lily, causing her to slowly turn to stone. Maxwell brings Lily to their brother Edwin's farm. Edwin teaches Maxwell about ‚ÄúStarites‚Äù (which are gained by helping other people), which Maxwell must collect to free Lily from the curse. Maxwell vows to help as many people as he can, and leaves the farm. After collecting Starites, Maxwell lifts the curse on Lily and the old man is revealed to be Maxwell's father in disguise. He cast the curse on Lily to teach Maxwell to be a better person. Maxwell's father is forgiven, and all is well in the world again. Reception Scribblenauts Unlimited has received mixed reviews. IGN gave the Wii U version an 8.8 out of 10, praising its creativity and level progression, though noting its difficulty was low, and the Nintendo characters were limited. Nintendo World Report gave the Wii U version a 9 out of 10, praising its use of the GamePad, its engaging gameplay, and the new object editor. Destructoid Jim Sterling was less impressed, giving it a 5.0 out of 10, calling it limited, panning its simplicity and stating that \\"it's not actually worth it to be inventive\\". In March 2013, the game was nominated for and won the Best Casual/Puzzle Game category of the Pocket Gamer Awards.

Wii Fit U utilizes both the Wii Balance Board and the Wii U GamePad in gameplay, and is bundled with the newly introduced Fit Meter, an activity meter accessory. It was released in Japan on October 31, 2013, followed by North America and Europe one day later. It is also the only game on the system to support the balance board. Gameplay Like its predecessors Wii Fit and Wii Fit Plus, Wii Fit U focuses on engaging the player in physical activities, including yoga and strength training, through use of the Wii Balance Board, a platform peripheral upon which the player stands during play that measures the player's weight and center of balance. Wii Fit U introduces additional activities that add the Wii U GamePad into gameplay. Owners of Wii Fit or Wii Fit Plus can transfer all saved data into Wii Fit U. Exercises are organized by category and by the amount of requisite exertion, measured in numerical values called \\"MET\\". Wii Fit U can display output on a television screen or only use its GamePad touchscreen. All retail copies of Wii Fit U are bundled with a foldable Wii U GamePad Stand and an activity meter (pedometer) called the Fit Meter, also available separately, which is carried while jogging or otherwise moving. The concept and overall design of the device are similar to the Pok√©walker released with Pok√©mon HeartGold and SoulSilver. When the Fit Meter is placed near the GamePad, its data is transferred via infrared connection to the Wii U. Wii Fit U has all the exercises from Wii Fit Plus except the following: *Segway Circuit *Rhythm Parade *Big Top Juggling *Skateboard Arena *Tightrope Tension *Snowboard Slalom *Lotus Focus *Penguin Slide As well as merging the regular and Plus versions of Table Tilt, Balance Bubble, and Basic Run into single entries. Wii Fit U adds the following exercises: *Dance **Beginner Dance **Hula Dance **Jazz Dance **Hip-Hop **Locking **Flamenco **Salsa **Burning Beats/Stamina Steps *Aerobics **Puzzle Squash **Free Boxing **Orienteering **Rowing Crew *Balance Games **Ultimate Obstacle Course **Dessert Course **Hosedown **Trampoline Target **Core Luge **Scuba Search **Climbing  Release  The game became available for purchase, in standard and Wii Balance Board bundles with Fit Meters, in December 2013 in the PAL regions and on January 10, 2014 in North America. In Japan the physical copy became available on February 1, 2014, although it had been released previously on the eShop than in North America and the PAL regions. Reception=Critical reception Wii Fit U, overall, is well received by critics, having a score of 72 out of 100 by 19 critics on Metacritic. One Metacritic review described it as being \\"friendly\\" and not \\"as hardcore as some fitness buffs may like.\\" Nintendo World Report praises the game for revolutionizing the exercising genre of video games by building upon its predecessor Wii Fit with \\"robust and customizable routines\\" and the gym community for motivation. Gaming magazine Polygon criticizes Wii Fit U as \\"too light-weight to be a contender\\" for actual exercise. Lifewire called it an \\"[i]nteresting use of the Gamepad [with] clever new mini-games [and an] improved fitness routine setup [compared to Wii Fit]\\". PC Magazine rated it 4 out of 5 or \\"excellent\\", calling it engaging and fun with many activities, as a worthy sequel and fitness tool. The New York Times described the game and its physical setup as efficient, unobtrusive, and motivating‚Äîconcluding that \\"it‚Äôs cheaper than joining a gym and it beats sitting on the couch and playing video games\\". US Gamer said that \\"[b]alance exercises are the most 'game-like' of all the activities\\", and that the game has solid integration with Nintendo's now-defunct Miiverse social network. Giving it a 4.5 out of 5, US Gamer concluded \\"Wii Fit U is a very solid package that achieves its primary goal of making you more aware of your fitness, how your body works and what you might need to do to make it work better. Its game-like nature and Nintendo charm keeps it interesting, enjoyable and never demoralizing.\\" Benefits studies Wii Fit U, like Wii Fit, has been used for treatments in physical therapy and not just for basic exercise. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, has used games that involve light to moderate activity in those with brain damage to aid in the patient's recovery. Research has found that users feel a better sense of balance and upper body motion, initiating a healing for those with brain injury. Concerning basic exercise, one study found that Wii Fit U is not fit for intensive exercise but rather moderate exercise and conditioning. The study concluded that the ability of the game's diverse exercises to increase physical growth is unknown.

Howard's sword and sorcery hero Conan the Barbarian. It was first published in paperback by Tor Books in April 1992, and was reprinted in April 1998. Plot After the events of \\"The Lair of the Ice Worm\\", Conan enters the Border Kingdom. Encountering a group of bandits, he learns that the guards of a caravan they plan to raid are led by Raihna, a female adventurer he had previously encountered in Conan the Valiant. This news leads him to abandon his inclination in joining the bandits and come to the aid of Raihna, instead. Afterwards, the duo enter the service of Eloikis, theoretical king over the restive and semi-independent lords of the country, who needs their aid against a powerful count and two demon-controlling wizards. The story follows their adventures as Eloikis' troubleshooters, which ultimately concludes with their rescue of both his daughter and grandson. But their partnership dissolves when Rhiana decides to marry one of the king's guards, and Conan resumes his wanderings, heading south.

The group was particularly concerned that pro-hunting members were attempting to prevent the society from expressing opposition to bloodsports; several of them had said they would lobby to have the RSPCA's charitable status removed if it campaigned against hunting.Ryder, Richard Dudley. Animal Revolution: Changing Attitudes Toward Speciesism. Berg, 2000, p. 172ff. The Reform Group was led by Brian Seager, John Bryant, and Stanley Cover, and the aim was to secure the election to the 46-member RSPCA Council of Bryant, Seager, and other supporters of the group's more radical agenda, including Andrew Linzey, the Oxford theologian, and Richard D.

It is the seventh console installment of the Raving Rabbids series. The game received mixed reviews, with critics praising several mini-games but criticizing its board game play style. The online services for the game were shut down on November 11, 2017. Plot Still on Earth, the Rabbids find themselves taking over an amusement park. Two Rabbids are attempting to go on one of the rides (not in disguise the first time, in disguise the second time as a dinosaur and in disguise the third time as a tall man), but are thrown out by an unseen person. One of the Rabbids contacts the Rabbid spaceship through an iPhone-like device. He tries to call the Rabbid in the spaceship, but the Rabbid in the spaceship is too busy playing with the Wii U Gamepad. Unaware of the consequences, the Rabbid in the spaceship continues to play with the Gamepad, which was actually controlling the whole ship. The Rabbid turns the Gamepad upside down, which causes the ship to land in the amusement park. Gameplay Gameplay is similar to the Mario Party series. It features a board game-like scenario. The player will have to roll a dice with the Wii U Gamepad and depending on the number the dice lands, the Rabbid will move to the corresponding square. These squares trigger a different feature and can be easily told apart just by looking at the symbol drawn on the square. Your primary goal is to win the board game by winning trophies, which can be collected by playing and winning minigames. Once a player has collected all trophies needed, you need to get to the center. Once you get to the center, the game is over and the player can win prizes. Although up to four players can take turns in the main game, only two players can play the minigames at a time. Soundtrack The music was composed by Jennifer Kes Remington. A 17-song soundtrack is available on the iTunes Music Store, and is based on the minigames played. Similar of the dance called Here Comes The Hotstepper by The Hit Crew from Just Dance 2, the game also includes licensed songs such as Make the Party (Don't Stop) by Bunny Beats (featuring Liquid) from Just Dance 4 , Dance All Nite by Anja from Just Dance 3 and Crazy Little Thing from Just Dance 4, also by Anja. Reception Rabbids Land received mixed reviews, mostly because of its board game style of play. Metacritic gives it an aggregate score of 52. IGN gave it a 5 out of 10, calling it \\"a mediocre party game mini-game collection.\\" IGN praised it for some amusing mini-games and good use of hardware but disliked the other mini-games, tired setup and terrible multiplayer setup. Nintendo Life gave Rabbids Land a positive review, giving it a 7 out of 10. Nintendo Life praised its fun mini-games and amazing graphics and said, \\"if you don't mind the one-to one restriction of the mini- games, there's a lot of fun to be had here.\\" Nintendo Life disliked a few mini-games saying \\"It's a few you can go without.\\" They noted that the lack of attractions is disappointing. GameInformer gave Rabbids Land a 4 calling the Rabbids \\"party poopers\\". GameInformer disliked the tired infused board game concept and low replay value. They also stated that the animation was great, but overall the graphics weren't impressive, claiming that the game still could have been a Wii game. \\"Nintendo World Report\\" gave it a 7 out of 10 score, praising its fun couch multi-player, Off-TV Play and well-designed style, but criticizing its low levels of difficulty, lack of creativity and disliked that only two players could play at a time.

The game was first announced at E3 2012 during Nintendo's press conference. Nintendo Land features twelve minigames, each based on an existing Nintendo game franchise such as Mario and The Legend of Zelda, depicted as attractions in the eponymous fictional amusement park with an Attraction Tour train designed as a tournament that utilizes all minigames. The minigames are designed to demonstrate the concept of Wii U and its Wii U GamePad controller to new players, in the same way the 2006 game Wii Sports demonstrated the Wii and its Wii Remote, utilizing many of the controller's features, including its touchscreen controls and motion-sensing capabilities. Some minigames incorporate the Wii Remote Plus and Nunchuk controllers for alternate control schemes and multiplayer support, which also helps exhibit \\"asymmetric gameplay\\", a concept in which certain players have different experiences based on the controller they use. Nintendo Land received positive reviews from critics and sold 5.20 million copies as of March 2020, making it the fifth highest-selling Wii U game. The ability to download the game was originally removed from the Nintendo eShop in North America in November 2013, but was re- added in August 2016. Gameplay The game takes place in an amusement park setting, which serves as a hub for the thirteen minigames, which are depicted as the park's attractions. A robotic character named Monita guides the player through Nintendo Lands features and attractions. The first twelve minigames of Nintendo Land are based on popular Nintendo franchises (two of the attractions (Metroid Blast and Mario Chase) are based on Wii U tech demos shown at E3 2011, but are modified to feature Nintendo characters) and are designed to incorporate elements which utilize the features of the Wii U GamePad, often in conjunction with other players using Wii Remotes and Nunchucks (with some games supporting up to five players in this configuration), with the thirteenth being an Attraction Tour train that is depicted as a tournament and uses two to five players. The combination of Wii Remotes and Wii U GamePads allows for what Nintendo calls \\"asymmetric gameplay,\\" where players have different experiences depending on which controller scheme they use. Completing minigames and completing certain objectives earns coins, which can be used to play a single-player pachinko minigame. Winning pachinko stages will earn new items for decorating the Nintendo Land hub area. Team attractions Number of players: 1‚Äì5 (1-4 in The Legend of Zelda: Battle Quest) ;The Legend of Zelda: Battle Quest Based upon The Legend of Zelda series. Up to three players (respectively dressed in red, blue, and yellow) use their Wii Remotes as swords to fight AI enemies. One more player (in green) uses the Wii U GamePad to control a character in the rear of the pack using a bow and arrow. The player with the GamePad can also lift their controller to spy for sniping AI. To reload their bow and arrow, the player aims the GamePad down. ;Metroid Blast Based upon the Metroid series and the \\"Battle Mii\\" tech demo from E3 2011. It is an action-adventure game, similar to its original series. The player using the Wii U GamePad controls Samus' Gunship, while up to four players with Wii Remotes and Nunchuks control Mii characters on foot, wearing Varia Suits. There are three modes, \\"Assault Mission\\", \\"Surface-Air Combat\\", and \\"Ground Battle\\". In \\"Assault Mission\\", the players cooperate to defeat waves of enemies and complete missions. In \\"Surface-Air Combat\\", the players with Wii Remotes and Nunchuks try to shoot down the player with the GamePad. In \\"Ground Battle\\" all players use Wii Remotes and Nunchuks in a battle for tokens. ;Pikmin Adventure Based on the Pikmin series. One player controls Captain Olimar who can command tiny Pikmin using the Wii U GamePad, whilst four additional players (as red, blue, yellow and white Pikmin) can control larger Pikmin using the Wii Remotes. Players must work together to help navigate levels and defeat enemies, including a boss at the end of the stage. When the boss is defeated, the players board Olimar's ship. There is also a Versus Mode where the players compete for candy. Competitive attractions Number of players: 2‚Äì5 ;Mario Chase Mario Chase, inspired by the Super Mario series, is a tag-based game that takes place inside an arena consisting of large obstacles, hills, and slides. One player using the GamePad, whose Mii is dressed as Mario, runs away from up to four players, whose Mii characters are dressed in Toad costumes, whose goal is to pursue and catch the single player. The Mario player, who views the action on the Wii U GamePad screen from a top-down perspective, has a map of the entire arena and can see the location of all the Toad players. The Toad players view the action on the television in split-screen from a third person perspective, and are each only given his current distance from Mario in yards or meters (depending on the region). The Toad player(s) win if one of them catches Mario before the time limit expires, otherwise the Mario player will win. If there are two players, two computer-controlled Yoshi carts will assist the Toad. ;Luigi's Ghost Mansion Luigi's Ghost Mansion, inspired by the 2001 Nintendo GameCube launch title Luigi's Mansion and based on the 2003 game Pac- Man Vs., is a game in which up to four players (dressed like Mario, Luigi, Wario and Waluigi) assume the roles of \\"ghost trackers\\" and explore a haunted house to hunt and capture a ghost, with the ghost being controlled by the player using the GamePad. Each level is set on a different floor with different layouts of rooms and hallways, and the action is viewed from above, showing the entire floor and the location of all players. The trackers must find the ghost player, who remains invisible on the television screen, and decrease its health (a numerical value from 0 to 100) by shining their flashlights upon it. Meanwhile, the ghost must sneak up and ambush each tracker to make them faint. The ghost's proximity to a tracker is made known when that player's Wii Remote begins to vibrate, and different events or conditions may cause the ghost to temporarily become visible to all trackers. Fainted trackers can be revived by the others by using their flashlights, though flashlight energy is in limited reserve and must be restored by picking up battery items. The ghost wins if all the trackers have fainted; the trackers win if they decrease the ghost's health to zero. ;Animal Crossing: Sweet Day Based on the Animal Crossing series, up to four players control animals trying to collect candy as a team before they get caught 3 times by the two guards, with both guards being controlled by the player using the GamePad. As players collect more candies, their movement becomes slower, making it easier for them to be caught. If starting the game with only two players, the format changes to the stash rules, where one animal must collect candies and put fifteen into the stashes on the map while avoiding the other player. ;Attraction Tour A train that features a megamix of all attractions depicted as a tournament. The player chooses how many rounds and how hard the tour will be. At the beginning of the Tour a player chooses who they face, and in what attraction by selecting a card. They must pick from the selected cards by the computer. The cards have who they face, and in what game. Most of the time the computer selects 1-Player attractions, but occasionally it will pick something like a 1-on-1 Mario Chase or The Legend of Zelda: Battle Quest, but in time attack mode. In all games, except for Multiplayer-only attractions, 1 player goes at a time, and the next after that. You will compete for the highest score in that game. In Multiplayer only attractions whoever wins wins. Each player who wins gets 3 points. Between rounds, players who aren't playing (if any) will vote on who they think will win and if they guess correctly they get two points. Whoever gets the most points after all the rounds wins the Attraction Tour. Solo attractions Number of players: 1 ;Takamaru's Ninja Castle Based on the 1986 Famicom Disk System game The Mysterious Murasame Castle, the player uses the GamePad's touchscreen to launch paper shuriken at waves of enemy ninjas. The controller can be tilted in order to change the trajectory of the throws. On boss ninjas or ninjas who are at close range, the players uses a katana. ;Donkey Kong's Crash Course The player uses the GamePad's gyroscope abilities to tilt a trolley through a platform-based obstacle course, influenced by the original Donkey Kong arcade game. In addition to the tilt input to move the trolley, the player controls the GamePad's two analog sticks, L and R shoulder buttons, and microphone to activate various levers, elevators, and pathways to advance themselves throughout the course. ;Captain Falcon's Twister Race A single-player game based on Nintendo's futuristic racing game F-Zero, where the player must race down a track while avoiding obstacles in 12 different areas. The GamePad is held vertically and its internal gyroscope is used to steer the vehicle when the player rotates the GamePad. The GamePad provides an aerial view (a more strategical view) of the track while the TV provides a third-person view on the track. ;Balloon Trip Breeze In this single-player game, based on Nintendo's Balloon Fight, the player will control their Mii on a play-field similar to the Balloon Trip mode. The player does this by swiping the stylus on the GamePad's touch screen to create gusts of wind that will move the Mii around. The GamePad will offer a zoomed-in view for more precise input whereas the TV will offer a zoomed-out view to see more of the level. The levels are divided into morning, afternoon, evening and night, which are all ended by landing on an island. Occasionally, there are packages on islands that the player can pick up to protect and deliver to the next island. ;Yoshi's Fruit Cart This attraction is based on the Yoshi series. The player uses the stylus on the GamePad touchscreen to draw a trail that guides Yoshi to the finish goal of each level while collecting all the fruit in the area. The fruit is only visible on the TV screen, so the player must use reference points in the level's background to draw the path on the GamePad. As the player advances in level, obstacles will appear that take away a life from Yoshi if he is led into one. ;Octopus Dance This attraction is based on Game & Watch Octopus. Octopus Dance is a rhythm game which plays by using the GamePad's Control Sticks and Gyro Sensor. Players must memorize and replicate the actions performed by the instructor on screen. Development Development started shortly after the release of Wii Sports Resort and was made at a time when the Wii U hadn't been finalized yet which led to the team experimenting with different prototypes. One of said prototypes involved the use of a gyroscope which directly led to Shigeru Miyamoto incorporating the technology into the Nintendo 3DS. The team's goal was to create a product that showcased all the features the new console could do. This led to a problem, as unlike the similar Wii Sports, the games were not inherently related. Early on one staff member suggested that they attempt to do something that would unite the various Nintendo franchises. As the team considered this too grand a concept, the idea was at first not taken seriously. The developers initially decided to present the theme as an \\"Expo\\" which lead to the theme park concept. Although most attractions were easy to theme, the team struggled with some: Metroid Blast was initially themed around Star Fox, while at one point it was considered to theme Donkey Kong Crash Course around either ExciteBike or 1080 Snowboarding.. Reception The game has received positive reviews from video games critics, praising its party atmosphere and attractions, especially the way they are developed and built up, with a few being critical of simply showing Wii U GamePad capabilities. IGN praised the game for showing the Wii U capabilities, its gameplay, its detailed and HD graphics and claiming that \\"Wii Sports has met its match\\", giving it an 8.7 score.  Sales  By March 2014, the game had sold 3.09 million copies, and by December 2014, it had sold 4.44 million units worldwide. , the game has sold 5.20 million copies.

There are two towers standing at the site: the first is the original brick keeper's house and tower, while the second is a skeletal tower moved to this site from Sapelo Island, Georgia in 1934. Neither is operational. History Congress appropriated $18,000 in 1867 for the construction of this light, and it was first lit in November of that year. This structure was built of Cream City brick and consisted of a keeper's house with attached tower; a fourth-order Fresnel lens was used for the flashing red beacon. In 1880 the light keeper erected a fence around the station in order to reduce drifting snow and sand, which were making access to the property difficult at times; this was supplemented in 1892 with a network of wooden walkways joining the various station buildings. More substantial changes commenced in 1895 with the addition of a steam whistle fog signal, which was replaced in 1929 with a diaphone horn; at the same time the beacon was converted from kerosene to electricity. A wooden house was erected for an assistant keeper in 1898; this was replaced by a red brick duplex in 1910. In 1934 the old tower was deactivated in favor of a skeletal tower erected somewhat closer to the point. This tower was taken from the Sapelo Island Light station in Georgia, which had been discontinued the previous year. The station was automated in 1958, and the light was finally discontinued in 1969. Neither tower was demolished, however, and in 1971 the federal government transferred the land surrounding the light station to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, which entertained the lead of establishing a harbor of refuge at the site. The light station itself was also transferred to the state in 1980. Two-thirds of the island was owned by David V. Johnson, a local developer who also purchased North Fox Island in 1994; the following year a land swap was proposed which would have given the state North Fox in exchange for Johnson receiving the remainder of South Fox. This set off a legal battle initiated by the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, who claimed rights to use of the island on the basis of an 1836 treaty; the local DNR district also objected to the swap, saying that the south island was more important to its mission than the north. After several years of hearings, the swap proposal was modified in 2001 to leave the portion incorporating the light station in the hands of the state; after the tribal claim was denied by the courts in the following year, the swap was allowed to proceed. Preservation efforts began in 1984, when a band of ten members of the Michigan Youth Corp performed a cleanup of the light station grounds. In 2002 the Fox Island Education Association was formed, which became the Fox Island Lighthouse Association in 2005 when it applied for nonprofit status.

Opened in 1795, it made Sagard the first bathing resort on R√ºgen and founded a healing spring establishment, that lasted until about 1830.  History = Beginnings  There were the beginnings of bathing establishments in Sagard in the mid-18th century. Its basis was the springs containing iron, lime, and carbon dioxide, which flow into the Sagarder Bach through meadows called the \\"Brunnenaue\\". At the end of the 18th century, the pastor, Heinrich Christoph von Willich, (1759‚Äì1827) had several of the springs on church land cleaned and tapped, squares and paths laid out, and a bathing house constructed. The \\"Spring, Bathing and Leisure Institution\\" opened on 4 July 1795. Sagard was thus the first bathing resort on R√ºgen. Willich's brother, Dr. Moritz von Willich, who was the state physician of R√ºgen and Swedish Pomerania, promoted the development of the bathing establishment by writing two promotional leaflets for the mineral spring. He wrote:  Success  Even in the opening year, about 100 spa visitors were recorded, primarily members of noble R√ºgen families and officials from Stralsund and Greifswald. The bath house built for them had a room for warm baths, a shower bath and two rooms for hot and cold spray, drip, knee and foot baths. The bathers were accommodated at the Lindenhaus inn and various private homes. Their care and counselling was undertaken by Dr. Moritz von Willich; a special spa doctor was not appointed. By the first decade of the 19th century, the number of bathers, some of whom were from abroad, grew to 500. Amongst the most famous bathers were Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland, Martin Heinrich Klaproth, Heinrich von Kleist and Wilhelm von Humboldt. The high level of interest in the health spa at Sagard may be explained by the prevailing zeitgeist of the Romanesque period. The undisturbed nature on R√ºgen fascinated visitors. Christoph von Willich encouraged this fascination, by making a path up to the chalk cliffs of the Stubbenkammer. Its construction, which included a 600-step descent to the Baltic Sea beach, counts as the first measure to develop the natural environment of R√ºgen for tourists.  Competition and decline  Around 1810 the bathing facility declined due to the occupation of R√ºgen by Napoleon's troops and the associated Napoleonic Wars. As early as 1807 Christoph von Willich had resigned from the post of spa director. Due to the decline of the bathing facility, plans to expand the mineral baths, which included the construction of a dance hall, a belvedere and other avenues, were not implemented. The foundation of the residence town of Putbus (1810) and the construction of the bathhouse in Goor (1817/1818) in the vicinity were additional competition. By the start of the 19th century, free swimming in the Baltic Sea came into fashion, instead of the use of traditional baths. Nevertheless, in 1818, a local tenant started up the bathing facility again. In 1819, the chronicler, Johann Jakob Gr√ºmbke, wrote: \\"Sagard on Jasmund (has) 106 houses and 614 inhabitants, with a health spring [Gesundbrunnen], which is quite popular.\\"Johann Jakob Gr√ºmbke: Neue genaue geographisch-statistisch- historische Darstellung von der Insel und dem F√ºrstenthume R√ºgen. Zur n√§heren und gr√ºndlicheren Kenntniss dieses Landes entworfen. Berlin 1819. The success did not last; as Friedrich Karl von Strombeck reported in 1833: \\"Sagard, where a deserted and dilapidated health spa [...]\\"Friedrich Karl von Strombeck: Darstellungen aus meinem Leben und aus meiner Zeit. Erster Teil. Braunschweig 1833, p. 289.  Current situation  Today, the Historic Brunnenaue Park (Historische Parkanlage Brunnenaue) recalls the glory of the former spa park with its promenades, fountains and bathhouses, displaying information of the first bathing establishing on R√ºgen at the actual historical site. The park was inaugurated on 7 April 2007 after being partially reconstructed.

It was sympatric with the other giant tortoise species of Madagascar, Grandidier's giant tortoise (Aldabrachelys grandidieri (also extinct)), and both species occupied both the coasts and the cooler highlands of Madagascar, where they fulfilled the role of large grazers.

Unlike its sister species, which had a low, flattened shell, A. abrupta had a high, domed shell. Extinction Material of this species has been dated to 750‚Äì2850 years before present, and it seems to have been widely distributed throughout Madagascar. It was estimated to have gone extinct c.

This could have taken the form of an equivalent value in shares in the operations of one of the subsidiaries of the national mining company to a maximum of 30% stake.GuineePress, \\"Alpha Cond√© et les mines: d√©lit de haute trahison. Voici les preuves\\", GuineePresse (8 June 2012) In January 2012, Palladino C2 wrote to the Minister of Mines requiring an account of how the funds had been utilised. In the absence of a reply, formal notice was given by Palladino C2 requiring an immediate repayment of the loan, with interest.Reuters \\"Guinea to pay back $25 mln Palladino loan\\" The loan was repaid on July 11, 2012. Allegations about the Loan Agreement In June 2012, the Sunday Times published an article about the Loan Agreement, and focussed on the default provision included in the agreement. It added that the loan had never been publicly revealed to Guineans, or ticked off in the national budget, although President Alpha Cond√© has said that \\"contracts that commit Guinea will be published on the Internet.\\" Former Guinean Minister of Mines, Mahmoud Thiam was quoted in various newspapers as alleging that the deal was a quid pro quo in return for Cond√© campaign support.Craig McKune, Stefaans Brummer and James Wood, \\"Tokyo-linked company in Guinea row\\", Mail & Guardian (29 June 2012) The Mail & Guardian alleged that as a result of the loan to Guinea, Guinea would not be permitted to sell any state interest in a mining asset without first offering the option to Palladino and should the firm wish to acquire a stake in a mining asset, it would be granted the privilege of a six-month negotiating period. If a deal could not then be struck, Guinea would only be allowed to negotiate with a third party without first right of refusal from Palladino.Craig McKune, Stefaans Brummer and James Wood, \\"Tokyo-linked company in Guinea row\\", Mail & Guardian (29 June 2012) =Response from Palladino= Following the publication of the Sunday Times article, Hennig's company, Palladino, issued a number of public statements about the Loan Agreement.Metal Bulletin \\"Palladino denies default provision in Guinean deal would give it 30% stake in assets\\" Palladino highlighted that the Loan Agreement contained customary default provisions but given the limited cash resources of the government, it also provided that in event of a default it could be repaid in cash and/or in kind. Lawyers emphasised that this repayment could not legally exceed the value of the debt due under the loan agreement and said that it could \\"in no way result in the appropriation of 30 percent of private or national assets worth billions of dollars\\". =Response from the Guinean GovernmentPublic statement The Guinean government also refused the allegations made by The Sunday Times and affirmed that there was no automatic convertibility to a 30 percent stake in Soguipami in case of default.factuguinee http://www.factuguinee.com/fichiers/videos5.php?langue=fr&idc;=fr_Communiqu__de_Presse_conjoint___Minist_re_des_Mines__Minist_r Guinea's minister of mines said that repayment would be at a value linked to the loan amount and accumulated interest and added that \\"the probability of Soguipami defaulting on this loan is minimal\\". The government also emphasised that the loan was not taken out by the Republic of Guinea, but by Soguipami, a parastal entity that was set up in September 2011 to manage the government's stakes in mining contracts. It was clarified that the loan was not collateralised by Soguipami itself, but by one of its subsidiaries.Metal Bulletin \\"Guinean minister Fofana rebuts Sunday Times' claims about Palladino deal\\" CNT investigation The CNT, the country's acting legislative body, convened a special plenary session on 28 June 2012,and called upon the two ministers to explain the agreement.

The funds were kept in an account at the Central Bank foreign holdings.Africalog, \\"Audition de Kerfalla Yansan√© et Mohamed Lamine Fofana par le CNT\\", Africalog (28 June 2012) No evidence of wrongdoing was found by the CNT and the matter has been dropped.

Design and development The Sam LS is a low-wing, tandem seat monoplane. It can be configured for conventional or tricycle landing gear. The fuselage is semi monocoque, with a welded 4130 steel tube protective cockpit cage structure and aluminum skin. Three different wing planforms for light-sport, STOL and amateur-built categories can be installed to a common fuselage. The aircraft can be flown open cockpit with the canopy removed. Prior to its first flight a prototype was shown at the 2012 EAA airshow. As of June 2013 the aircraft was on Transport Canada's list of accepted advanced ultralights, but has not completed US Federal Aviation Administration special light-sport aircraft approval. In July 2013 pricing was announced for kits and sub-kits, including wings, fuselage and empennage. In a break from normal industry practice the company said that it would offer those three sub-kits for a total that was the same as if they were ordered as a single kit, US$29,000. The complete kit with a Rotax 912ULS engine and Dynon Skyview avionics was forecast to cost US$65,000 at that time, taking a factory-estimated 900 hours to complete. By August 2014 the company was up for sale as SAM Aircraft President Thierry Zibi indicated that he would rather develop new designs than run a production operation.

Overall shape of the cephalon is semicircular. The glabella tapers forward, is defined by deep axial furrows, and has three pairs of lateral furrows that are directed backward and inward and which do not connect across the midline. The glabella is separated from the anterior margin by a very conspicuous narrow convex preglabellar field that is lower than and does not reach the adjacent fixigenae. Occipital ring is distinct. Without eyes but for one known exception. Eye ridges (when present) are threadlike, evenly curved, extending from anterior corners of the glabella to the genal angles. Anterior cephalic border furrow is deep, concave and wider than the narrow convex border itself. The lateral cephalic border is divided longitudinally by a suture and extends into slender, backward-directed genal spines. Genal spines extend to the 4th thorax segment, but are often broken off, even in well preserved specimens. The hypostome is natant (or floating) i.e. not attached to the doublure and aligned with front edge of the glabella . The cephalic doublure and ventral sutures are not known. Thorax consists of 14 segments, with a rather narrow axis (of about 20% of the total width) that tapers evenly backwards. Deeply furrowed pleurae extend outward perpendicular to the axis and have rounded tips. Pygidium has 6 to 8 segments that are arched backward and become less well-defined towards posterior. The pygidium is semicircular in outline, its outer margin evenly curved, and it has a narrow, well-defined border. It is about half as wide as the cephalon (micropygous), and about half as long as wide.  Secondary sight  Conocoryphe provides a rare (but not unique) example of secondary eye development. Conocoryphids lack eyes except for Conocoryphe oculata. This species is otherwise very similar to its relatives from the Montagne Noir region in France. C. oculata has normal curving eye ridges, although the dorsal suture is marginal like in its blind family. Due to poor preservation, lenses have not been found. It seems that the expression of a gene for eye development was only suppressed and not lost, and the eye could develop when the suppression lifted.

To solve this problem and to continue economic development, for years the country has been adding to its total land area by reclaiming land from the sea. Geography The entire district of Fontvieille was constructed on land reclaimed from the sea in the western part of Monaco in the 1970s. It is the newest of the four traditional quartiers (districts) in the principality of Monaco, and one of ten Wards for modern administrative purposes. Land has also been added to areas of La Condamine and Larvotto/Bas Moulins. Land reclamation in Monaco since 1861 History Prince Albert's father, Rainier III, was known as the \\"Builder Prince\\". In an attempt to further develop the economy of Monaco, he first supported the idea of land reclamation. Since it was impossible to extend into France, the only solution was to reclaim land from the sea. First, the Larvotto beach district was created in the early 1960s, then the Fontvieille industrial area, increasing the principality's surface area by approximately 20 percent. More recently, Port Hercules has been extended to welcome larger cruise ships on one side, and to provide land for a new Yacht Club on the other. Projects=Le Portier Le Portier, also known as Portier Cove, is the main land reclamation project in Monaco as of 2020. The reclamation itself has been completed but the land is still undeveloped and is planned to be fully completed in 2025. Others Prince Albert II is currently planning to reclaim even more land. He intends to build into the Mediterranean to create a new area about 5 hectares (12.5 acres) in size. The new district will extend from the Fontvieille district at the western foot of the Rock of Monaco, where Monaco's palace and historic centre are situated. The project will cost an estimated ‚Ç¨11 billion. It was suspended in 2009 due to the global financial crisis and the Prince's concerns regarding the marine environment, but the project was resumed in 2010 and was planned to be completed by 2014. However, as of 2020, it has yet to be finished. Issues Monaco's coastline on the Mediterranean is already a fragile and vulnerable environment. Any further land reclamation projects threaten to disturb or damage the coastal ecosystem. Monaco's leaders have approached the prospect of further land reclamation with caution and have stated that new projects would have to meet strict environmental standards to limit damage to flora and wildlife. Due to the concerns that land reclamation could potentially damage local marine ecosystems, Prince Albert II has insisted the entire expansion be placed on stilts, like an oil rig, in order to disturb the sea floor as little as possible.

Defiance takes place on a terraformed Earth several years into the future. It is a tie-in to the Syfy show of the same name. The game was released in April 2013 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It was also released on Steam. The game went free-to-play on June 4, 2014 for PC, August 14, 2014 for PS3 and November 18, 2014 for Xbox 360. Gameplay Characters come from one of four Origins: Veterans, Outlaws, Machinists, or Survivalists. Veterans are a group of soldiers who survived The Pale Wars, a massive conflict between humans and aliens. Outlaws are criminals who raid and destroy for fortunes. Machinists are scavengers, who recover alien technology to make profits and a living from it. Survivalists are humans or aliens who attempt to survive in the newly formed, hostile world. Besides initial starter weapon and also costume - this choice, similar to Race (Human, Irathient, and Castithan) has no consequence in the later game, with all weapons, abilities and costumes being equally accessible to all players beyond the tutorial area. Players can choose to be either a Human or an \\"Irathient\\" (a humanoid alien species who are similar to humans), or the Castithan race if they have particular downloadable content available. The Ark Hunters are injected with an EGO (Environmental Guardian Online), a symbiotic, neuro-muscular bionetic implant developed by Von Bach Industries, which helps players navigate the Bay Area and gives them access to unique abilities. Setting The game takes place in the San Francisco Bay Area, 15 years after the devastating Pale Wars between Earth and a loose alliance of extraterrestrial races known as Votanis Collective. The Votans came to Earth seeking a new home after the destruction of their solar system, unaware that the planet was already inhabited. Friction between the new arrivals and Humanity led to war, during which the Votan's terraforming technology was unleashed. The Earth's surface was drastically altered as a result, introducing radical changes in topography, the extinction of plant and animal species, and the emergence of new species. Afterward, Humans and Votans were forced to live together. Player characters are enlisted as \\"Ark Hunters\\" by industrialist Karl Von Bach to search the Bay Area for advanced and expensive alien technology. Players also take part in side missions to earn cash or challenges in which they compete with other Ark Hunters. Development Defiance had been in development since August 2008. It started as a collaborative effort between Trion and Syfy to make a video game that ran alongside a television series. The publisher has reportedly spent more than $70 million during development. The game's business model was changed from a paid game to a free-to play game on May 1, 2014 so as to introduce the game to a broader audience. Trion Worlds also added that they would consider the possibility of developing a port for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One once the consoles have a large player base. In October 2015, Syfy announced that the Defiance show would be discontinued after the end of its third season, but Trion Worlds would continue to support the game after the show's cancellation. On March 1, 2016, Trion announced the \\"Dark Metamorphosis\\" update for the game, which was publicized as Season Four of Defiance. Defiance 2050 In December 2017, Trion Worlds confirmed a Playstation 4 version of the game is in development. They also stated they had no plans of making a sequel, instead they will continue to update the game with new content. The new version, named Defiance 2050, came out on July 10, 2018 for PC, Xbox One, and PS4. It features the same map, story, missions, NPCs, enemies, sounds, HUD, and other assets from the first game; however, the four classes have been replaced with four new ones, each of which has its own EGO power tree. Many of the weapons were also replaced, weapon skills were consolidated, and some other minor tweaks were made. Cosmetic items that were purchased for the first game are automatically copied to Defiance 2050, but other items are not, including any items that players won from loot crates that were paid for with cash (like the Omec Respark Energizer V). Player characters cannot be transferred from the first game to the second. Like its predecessor, Defiance 2050 is free to play. Server closure On April 27 2020, Gamigo announced on the official Defiance forums that the Defiance servers for Xbox 360 would be shut down on May 25, 2020 and the game would no longer be accessible. PC and PS3 servers would be unaffected by this shutdown. Any users who had an account for Defiance 2050 or wished to create one, would be given a one time special compensation and transfer benefit based on various in game progress factors and purchases on their accounts. http://forums.defiance.com/showthread.php?330350-FAQ-Defiance- XBOX-360-Closure Reception The game received \\"mixed\\" reviews on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic, and from critics as well. 411Mania gave the Xbox 360 version a score of seven out of ten and called it \\"a good foundation for a console MMO.\\" The Digital Fix similarly gave it seven out of ten and said that it \\"settles into its rhythm very nicely and becomes a game that is so easily picked up and played you cannot help but fall for it a little.\\" National Post gave the PlayStation 3 version a score of six out of ten, saying that it \\"seems simply to offer yet another big open world filled with weapons to collect and creatures to kill. I won‚Äôt deny that I‚Äôve had moments of fun blowing holes in Hellbugs over the last week, but it was of a flavourless variety I could have derived from any number of other third-person shooters.\\" The Escapist gave the same console version two-and-a-half stars out of five and called it \\"a middle-of-the road third-person shooter that never seems to fully capitalize on its alien-filled, post apocalyptic setting.\\" Digital Spy gave it two stars out of five and said, \\"The potential is there for Defiance to be more than a half-decent console MMO marred by technical problems.\\" Metro UK gave the Xbox 360 version a similar score of four out of ten and said, \\"A mix of low budget, (relatively) high ambition, and mediocre execution, Defiance is a hard game to hate but an easy one to lose interest in.\\" NotesReferencesExternal links Defiance Wiki * Defiance (TV series) Role-playing video games Free-to-play video games Massively multiplayer online games PlayStation 3 games Post-apocalyptic video games Science fiction video games Third-person shooters Video games based on television series Video games developed in the United States Video games set in the 2040s Video games set in San Francisco Windows games Xbox 360 games 2013 video games Massively multiplayer online role-playing games Persistent worlds Gamebryo games ","title":"Defiance (video game)"},{"id":"36049447","text":"Gounelleoeme echinoscapus is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae, the only species in the genus Gounelleoeme.Bezark, Larry G.

The game was directed by Hideki Kamiya and produced by Atsushi Inaba; the pair also worked together on the Viewtiful Joe series and ≈åkami. It was released in August 2013 in all major regions except North America, where it released the following month. The Wonderful 101 received generally positive reviews, but failed to meet sales expectations. In February 2020, PlatinumGames announced a remastered version for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Windows, financed through crowdfunding, which was released in May 2020. The remastered version is PlatinumGames' first self-published title. Gameplay Screenshot of an earlier version of the game depicting a \\"Unite Morph\\" ability used to battle an opponent. The heroes have combined to form \\"Unite Hand\\", which is shown punching a large enemy called the Diedough- Goo. In The Wonderful 101, players control a horde of superheroes from an isometric viewpoint and can turn them into various objects called \\"Unite Morphs.\\" As levels progress, players must explore each stage to find helpless citizens and recruit them to join their army of heroes. The more heroes gathered, the greater the special morph powers can be. At the cost of depleting their battery meter, players can use \\"Unite Morph\\" forms to defeat enemies, solve puzzles, or traverse the environment. The meter can be recharged by performing normal attacks or by picking up batteries dropped by a defeated enemy. Enemies will also drop \\"O parts\\" (the in-game currency used to buy upgrades), new \\"Unite Morph\\" abilities and items. To transform the horde of heroes, the appropriate symbol is drawn on the Wii U GamePad's touchscreen or right analog stick, such as an ‚ÄúL‚Äù for a gun or a squiggly line for a whip. In specified areas, the GamePad (by default) is used to change the view to a traditional, third-person angle and better explore tighter environments, such as those found indoors and inside caves. The single-player campaign is broken into levels. Each level ends with a grade depending on a number of factors, such as how long it takes the player to complete the level and how much damage was taken by the player. In addition to a single-player mode, the game has a cooperative mode that supports up to five players, with one person utilizing the Wii U GamePad and the four others each using their own Wii U Pro Controllers. Synopsis The game takes place during a third war between Earth and an alien terrorist organization called the Geathjerk Federation that has invaded the planet. The only hope for humanity is the Wonderful Ones, a group of superheroes working for the CENTINELS Planetary Secret Service, an organization created by the United Nations. Characters The main protagonists are Will Wedgewood (Wonder-Red) (voiced by Charlie Schlatter), a Blossom City elementary school teacher and the leader of the Wonderful Ones, whose father Arthur is killed by Laambo; Eliot Hooker (Wonder-Blue) (voiced by Roger Craig Smith), a police detective whose older brother is killed by Vijounne (voiced by Paula Tiso); guns expert Jean-Sebastain Renault (Wonder- Green) (voiced by Kari Wahlgren); fashion modeler Mariana Kretzulesco (Wonder- Pink) (voiced by Tara Strong); Russian soldier Ivan Istochinkov (Wonder- Yellow) (voiced by JB Blanc); ninja-in-training Momoe Byakkoin (Wonder-White) (voiced by Yuri Lowenthal); and video game player Krishna Ramanujan (Wonder- Black) (voiced by Kris Zimmerman). The supporting characters are P-Star, a robot who assists the heroes; Laurence Nelson (Wonder-Captain) (voiced by Gideon Emery), the commander of the CENTINELS who was previously known as Wonder-Red; Virgin Victory operator Alice MacGregor (voiced by Laura Bailey); and science chief James Shirogane (voiced by Fred Tatasciore). Luka Alan Smithee (voiced by Debi Derryberry) is a Blossom City Elementary School student whose scientist mother, Margarita, died working for the CENTINELS and gave her life so that the artificial intelligence, Mother Platinum, could sustain the Earth's defensive shield. Luka joins the group and becomes Wonder- Goggles at the end of the game. The last member of the Galactic Police Federation is Immorta (voiced by Stephanie Lemelin); her brother, Prince Vorkken (voiced by Quinton Flynn), lived at the Roaming Comet Rhullo, but was brainwashed by Gimme, an alien who plants a virus in the form of a bio-weapon insect named Vaaiki on Vorkken's body. Vorkken becomes the space pirate leader of the Guyzoch and sides with Chewgi. The main villain is Jergingha (voiced by Steve Blum), the supreme overlord of the Geathjerk Federation, who is attempting to use Chi-Q to take back the galaxy from humanity. Plot The story opens with a school bus full of children being attacked by alien invaders known as the Geathjerk. The teacher, Mr. Wedgewood, transforms into the superhero Wonder-Red and teams up with the other superheroes to destroy the aliens with Unite Morph powers. One student, however, Luka, appears disillusioned and expresses his hate for both the heroes and the aliens. The heroes then meet on their flagship to plan their defences. The Earth is protected from invasion by a shield, powered by five Super Reactors. The heroes must travel around the world to protect these reactors and destroy the aliens who slip through the shield. As they travel, they meet up with Professor Shirogane, who explains that once the reactors are safe, they will use an orbiting cannon, the Shirogane Comet, to destroy the remainder of the aliens. Along the way, Wonder-Red struggles to lead his team, particularly Wonder-Blue, whose brother was killed by one of the alien leaders, Vijounne. Blue's desire for revenge causes several problems until Red convinces him to cooperate with the team. Also, Luka stows away on the ship and the heroes are forced to bring him along to keep him safe. The heroes also repeatedly fight the space pirate Prince Vorkken and his first mate Chewgi. Vorkken is searching for the strongest fighters in the galaxy so that he can have the strength to get revenge on the Geathjerk. Vorkken fights with Unite Morph attacks similar to those of the heroes and serves as a foil to Wonder-Red in their encounters. With the help of Vorkken's sister, Immorta, the heroes defeat him, and Wonder-Red convinces Vorkken that his desire for revenge has turned him evil. At the climax of the story, Luka betrays the heroes and joins the aliens, revealing that his pendant is the key that controls the Super Reactors. Luka explains that his mother died working on the shield that protects the Earth and he wants the aliens to destroy the Earth to get revenge for the loss of his mother. Wonder-Red however, announces that Luka's mother is still alive: she turned herself into Mother Platinum, the computer system that controls Earth's defences. Luka abandons his desire for revenge and Mother Platinum gathers pieces of the destroyed city to create a giant robot named \\"Platinum Robo\\". Using the robot, the heroes fight their way to the Shirogane Comet and fire its cannon, destroying the invading fleet. Jergingha, leader of the aliens, does not give up and returns in a gigantic fortress with an even bigger fleet. Platinum Robo flies to attack the fortress, while Chewgi and Vorkken arrive to help break through its defences. Upon being confronted, Jerrgingha reveals the Geathjerk are actually from 1,500 years in the future where Earth becomes an evil empire called the Greater Galactic Coelition, which has destroyed the homeworlds of the Geathjerk leaders. Geathjerk has come back in time to destroy Earth to prevent the Coelition from ever existing. Jergingha's fortress turns into a giant robot, even bigger than Platinum Robo, but the Wonderful Ones, Immorta, and Vorkken all combine their power and destroy it, saving the world. The Guyzoch leave with Vorkken to help rebuild the worlds they attacked. The Wonderful Ones vow to make sure Earth never becomes an Evil Empire like Jergingha seemingly predicted. Luka joins the Wonderful 100 to help make up for his mistakes. As a result, the team is renamed to the \\"Wonderful 101\\". The epilogue shows Luka (now \\"Wonder-Goggles\\") and the other heroes saving a school bus from the aliens, paralleling the game's opening. The story ends with the heroes continuing their fight against the remaining Geathjerk. Development The development of what would become The Wonderful 101 began during the lifetime of the Wii. The original idea came from PlatinumGames' president, Tatsuya Minami, who wanted to bring a group of popular or iconic video game characters together in one game. Because different gamers would prefer certain characters over others, the idea of being forced to play as a certain character at various points in the game was quickly scrapped. Instead, all of the characters would be on-screen at once so the player could choose between them at any time. PlatinumGames initially thought of using Nintendo first-party characters, who would work together to get past obstacles, but when the idea was presented to Nintendo, they questioned how the mechanic would fill an entire game. Director Hideki Kamiya also doubted that the \\"conflicting elements\\" of the different Nintendo characters could be successfully \\"put into a consistent formula\\" like in the Super Smash Bros. series. Further brainstorming was put on hold while he worked on another game, but when progress on that game was halted a year later, work on The Wonderful 101 resumed. Kamiya decided to use the Japanese henshin / transforming theme, with a group of five original heroes who could unite and transform into various weapons. Soon the group expanded to one hundred heroes and the Japanese superhero style changed to \\"an American comic book vibe\\". The game's design document was released by Platinum after stretch goals in the Kickstarter campaign for the remaster were met. Although the developers had been thinking of making the game for the Wii, when PlatinumGames and Nintendo finalized their partnership, it became Wii U-exclusive. The developers wanted to use the console's unique features effectively, so they came up with drawing on the GamePad as a way to activate the \\"Unite Morphs\\". Music The music in this game is an orchestrated score, written by Hiroshi Yamaguchi, Akira Takizawa, Hitomi Kurokawa, Norihiko Hibino, Masato Kouda, and Rei Kondoh. The theme songs are called \\"The Won- Stoppable Wonderful 100\\" and \\"The Won-Stoppable Wonderful 101\\". They are sung by Foresta in the Japanese version and by Jimmy Wilcox, Rob McElroy, and Bruce Blanchard in the English version. A two-volume, official soundtrack was released on September 15, 2014. For Remastered, Yoko Shimomura, Keiichi Okabe, and Yuzo Koshiro provided several arrangements. Marketing The Wonderful 101 was revealed at E3 2012 on the conference floor, codenamed Project P-100. On July 3, 2013, Nintendo introduced their \\"Wonderful Wednesday\\" social networking campaign to promote The Wonderful 101, where on each Wednesday leading up to the game's launch, they release a new character portrait. Two days later, however, Kamiya posted on Twitter that he was worried about the lack of marketing for The Wonderful 101. He was referring to the lack of information in magazines or websites, and claimed that the game took almost 1.5 times the resources and manpower as Platinum's biggest game, Bayonetta. During the August 7, 2013 Nintendo Direct, Satoru Iwata announced that in two days time, a Nintendo Direct presentation would be made exclusively for The Wonderful 101. Remastered In a May 2018 interview, Kamiya stated that the team have some ideas for a possible port on the Nintendo Switch, as he made internal documents on how they would do it. Platinum launched a Kickstarter in February 2020 to port the game in a remastered edition to the Switch and other platforms including PlayStation 4 and Windows when stretch goals were met, with further stretch goals to add downloadable content to the game. Hideki Kamiya and Atsushi Inaba said that they had approached Nintendo, the publisher and co-owner of copyright and solely owner of trademark, about republishing the game for a wider audience. Nintendo only wanted to publish a new game if it was going to be exclusive to Nintendo Switch, while Platinum wanted the remaster to be on more platforms. Nintendo allowed them to do it, though they wouldn't publish the remaster. This gave Platinum the opportunity to try self-publishing. With the game nearly in a complete state for these new ports, they opted to use Kickstarter not only to judge how popular the game was, and thus mitigate the Kickstarter's stretch goals based on this, but also that there was still a necessary business element to self-publishing that the Kickstarter funds would help cover and deal with risks involved with publishing. Studio executive director Atsushi Inaba affirmed the Kickstarter was not about money for development but as a means to bring the community together and to make sure what additional content they could bring to the base game. Among other cosmetic updates, Platinum had devised a way to take the two-screen approach that had been used on the Wii U version (including the picture-in-picture) into a version that will work on the single-screen platforms. Drawing features will still be incorporated in the Switch version. Within hours, the campaign had surpassed its goals for all three versions. The campaign concluded with over raised, achieving several of the stretch goals that included a separate 2D side-scrolling game based on the adventures of Luka. A celebratory Twitch stream held by PlatinumGames at the Kickstarter's conclusion brought in additional donations that allowed a last stretch goal, orchestral arrangements of two of the game's songs, to be made as well. Remastered was released digitally in North America on May 19, 2020, in Europe on May 22, 2020, and in Japan on June 11, 2020. Reception The Wonderful 101 received generally positive reviews from critics. It has an aggregate score of 78/100 on Metacritic. The game was praised for its innovative gameplay and the depth of its combat system, but its hard learning curve received a mixed response, with some criticizing it and others such as Nintendo Enthusiasts Michael Nelson praising the game for requiring a certain amount of skill. Most reviewers enjoyed the ridiculously nonsensical story, characters, and humor, but some found the few sexual jokes in the game to be out-of-place in what was perceived as a kid-friendly game (although it has a Teen rating). The Wonderful 101s length and pacing seemed a bit drawn-out to some reviewers due to repetitive enemies and boss fights, while others thought these issues were unproblematic thanks to the even distribution of new moves and upgrades. The necessity of forming weapons by drawing on the touchscreen garnered a mixed reception. Many reviewers found that the GamePad worked fine for straight lines or circles (to make a sword or a fist), but that it sometimes interpreted more complex shapes as the wrong weapon. Others thought that drawing simple shapes on the GamePad while using the right analogue stick for others was more reliable, or that the GamePad worked perfectly and it was simply a matter of practice. The camera was criticized for being too zoomed- out to keep track of all of the characters during battle but also too zoomed- in to see the occasional out-of-view enemy. Reviewers agreed that the game lived up to PlatinumGames' trademark high difficulty, with some citing the controls and camera as contributing factors. Nearly all critics were pleased with the creative uses of the GamePad's second screen. However, a few thought that navigating inside of a building using the controller's gyroscope was clunky. Many also thought the multiplayer mode was enjoyable, but often lost track of their own group of characters. Most agreed that it felt \\"tacked on\\". The Wonderful 101 cartoony art style and flashy effects in battle were also praised. The set-pieces and giant bosses were likewise well-received, as were the voice acting and soundtrack. Sales Nintendo shipped 30,000 copies for the game's launch in Japan. The game sold 5,258 physical copies in its first week in Japan, where it went on to sell 27,028 physical units. The game reached 22nd place in its first week on the UK sales chart. In the United States, The Wonderful 101 sold 49,000 units by the end of 2013, bringing the game's total known sales to units in Japan and the United States. Legacy Both Atsushi Inaba and Hideki Kamiya have expressed interest in a sequel. The seven main protagonists appeared as Trophies in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, and Wonder-Red and Wonder-Blue appeared as Spirits in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.

Built in 1939, the , 19-building apartment community compose a historic district that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 24, 2004. Ground for the development was broken the week of March 20, 1939, and work was started on a full-time basis with Everett A. Carson of Indianapolis as the builder. Architects, Granger & Bollenbacher of Chicago, created the Colonial Revival apartment community for owners at the time, Marcy Realty Corporation. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs History On October 10, 1938, a project hearing was held before the Board of Zoning Appeals on a petition for variance to permit construction to start within two weeks on the $1,680,000 multi-apartment project to be located in northeast Indianapolis. Samuel B. Sutphin of New Augusta, owner of the 25-acre site for the proposed project, filed the petition with the zoning board. Purchase of the site by the Marcy Realty Corporation depended upon favorable action by the zoning board. The multi apartment project first was planned by its sponsors on a tract at 59th street and the Monon Railroad but was abandoned when nearby property owners protested. The new site was bounded on the north by 46th street between College and Keystone Ave in Indianapolis, just north of the Indiana State School for the Deaf. Development of the project took 500 workmen nearly eight months to construct. The Marcy Village large-scale housing project was the first Federal Housing Administration project of its type completed in Indiana. The buildings are distributed over the twenty-five-acre tract. Marcy Village, which represents an expenditure of approximately $1,690,000, was an implemented under section 207of the National Housing Act of 1934. Under that section, sponsors may borrow from some private lending institution approved by the government any amount up to $5,000,000, at an interest rate not to exceed 4%, for terms to be approved by the administer and which in some instances run as long as thirty three years, for the construction of apartment buildings or groups of single-family buildings. At the time, Marcy Village was the 90th project completed in Indiana under that plan, though Marcy Village was the largest of its type in Indiana. Colonial architecture is the primary design of the nineteen buildings of the project. Additionally to the apartments, there were shops consisting of five storerooms, which were occupied by a drug store, grocery, barber shop, beauty shop, and dentists' and doctors offices. General contractor General contractor for the project was Everett A. Carson, Indianapolis-based general contractor, and father of Dr. Wayne Carson, surgeon and sponsor. E. A. Carson built structures in and near Indianapolis, including the front for SS. Peter and Paul Cathedral on North Meridian Street, St. Joan of Arc Catholic Church and parochial school building, and several academic buildings for Indiana University.

Some of the largest and most innovative land reclamation projects have occurred in the UAE. Countless land reclamation projects, both completed, under construction, and planned, have changed the appearance of Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and other emirates and helped to make them world-famous. History Abu Dhabi One reclamation method used in Abu Dhabi is filling in low-lying coastal salt flats. Several industrial areas have been built in these areas. Yas Island, Al Reem Island, and Al Lulu Island are a few examples. Ajman There have been proposals to reclaim land from the sea in Ajman. However, many have been rejected due to environmental concerns. Dubai Land reclamation in the emirate of Dubai has made it one of the most recognizable areas in the world. Dubai is perhaps most well known for land reclamation projects such as the Palm Islands, the World Islands, the Dubai Marina, and the Burj Al Arab. Most major land reclamation projects in Dubai have occurred in the past fifteen years, and the Burj Al Arab hotel, which is built on a man-made island, was started in 1994 and completed in 1999. Ras Al Khaimah The emirate of Ras Al Khaimah has also joined the race to build new land reclamation projects. Such projects include Al Marjan Island and its Real Madrid Resort Island. Geography The Palm Islands are located off the coast of The United Arab Emirates in the Persian Gulf and will add 520 kilometers of beaches to the city of Dubai. Projects * The World Islands * Burj Al Arab * Palm Jumeirah * Palm Jebel Ali * Palm Deira * Al Marjan Island * Yas Island * Al Reem Island * The Universe Islands * Port Rashid Issues There have been numerous environmental and economic concerns regarding the various land reclamation projects in the UAE.

McDonough was a native of Annaghdown, County Galway but had travelled widely throughout Ireland, spending a great deal of time in Dublin (at one stage apparently entertaining either faculty of students at Trinity College, Dublin, and associated with Canon James Goodman of Trinity). According to O'Neill, \\"old people speak of this remarkable piper's facility in giving to the music an appeal and expression peculiarly his own. An all-around player, capable of meeting all demands, he had a preference for piece or descriptive music.\\" While in the capital, > \\"McDonough‚Äôs name was placarded conspicuously in Dublin as the celebrated > Irish piper from Annaghdown, County Galway, especially on the bridges > crossing the Liffey. While playing on the streets one evening, to the keen > delight of an appreciative audience, some well-to-do gentry who came along > were so captivated by his inimitable execution that they took him into a > clubhouse or hotel in the vicinity.

This so angered > the waiting audience that they stoned the building, and didn‚Äôt leave a whole > pane of glass in the windows within reach of their missiles. His nickname, Mac an Asal (son of the ass) arose from his father's profession as a dealer in donkeys or asses. McDonagh Sr. had his son play the pipes, sitting on one of them, as he guided them to a fair or market. He was married and had at least one child, a Mrs. Kenny, \\"Queen of the Irish Fiddlers\\", who was married to piper John Kenny. PiperJohn Flannagan(born 1870) married mrs. Kenny's daughter. . McDonough himself was reduced to dire poverty by Great Famine, forcing him to leave Dublin and die in Gort poorhouse. O'Neill remarks > \\"His splendid instrument, made specially for him by Michael Egan, the most > famous of all Irish pipemakers, while both were in Liverpool, was treasured > by his widow for seven years after his death.
