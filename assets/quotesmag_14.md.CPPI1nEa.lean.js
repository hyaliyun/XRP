Origins of the conflict  The conflict between Novgorod and Teutonic Knights began in 1210, when the knights attacked the Estonians. Novgorod campaigned against the Livonians in 1217, 1219, 1222, and 1223, facing repeated failure. In 1224, the knights captured Dorpat (now Tartu). Soon after the capture of Dorpat, an internal conflict arose in Novgorod. The townspeople refused to help in the fight against the knights. Soon, a split occurred among the Novgorod nobles. Expelled from the city, the nobles and the Knights captured Izborsk in 1233, but soon were expelled from the city by the Pskov army. A year later, Yaroslav Vsevolodovich of Novgorod returned to the Livonian lands and devastated the outskirts of the town Odenpa, triumphing over Emajõe and forcing the Livonians to sign a peace agreement. In 1236, Lithuania had lost a Great Master of the Order of the Sword Volquin von Winterstein, and Pope Gregory IX gave his consent to the Union of the Order of the Sword with the Teutonic Knights. The master of the Order was Hermann von Balk. In December 1237, Pope Gregory IX proclaimed the second crusade against Finland. Danish king Waldemar II and the joint Masters of the Order agreed to divide Estonia and attacked Baltic Russia in June 1238 in collaboration with the Swedes. The Russian lands were weakened by the Mongol invasion.  First stage 1240-1241  In July 1240, the Swedish commanders Jarl Birger and Ulf Fassi attempted to invade Novgorod land under the pretext of exterminating the Gentiles. Subordinating the tribes and some EMI, the Swedes believed in a quick and easy victory over the Russians, whose troops had been defeated by the Mongols. However, Prince Alexander, without requesting assistance from Vladimir nor collecting all of the Novgorod militia, managed to intercept the Swedes at the mouth of the Izhora river. On July 15, 1240, Alexander's army camp was attacked by the Swedes. Known as the Battle of Neva, the Novgorod defeated the Swedes. In August, the Livonian knights captured the town of Izborsk and arrived at the outskirts of Pskov, beginning a siege. The knights managed to bribe the Governor of the Pskov, Tverdila, and he opened the gates of the city. The townspeople tried to resist but, in the end, had to surrender.  End of the campaign In the winter of 1240/1241, the Novgorodians took Pereyaslavl-Zalessky. After, the Teutonic knights constructed the fortress of Koporie, where they kept all their supplies, and took the Novgorod city of Tesov, pillaging its merchants and ravaging the surrounding area. The Novgorodians, fearing a fate similar to that of Pskov, sent envoys to Prince Yaroslav. Yaroslav liked Alexander's younger brother Andrew as a leader, but Novgorod insisted on Alexander. Alexander returned to Novgorod and commanded its army to Koporye in 1241. In the Spring of 1242, he recaptured Pskov. After this victory, Alexander decided to continue his campaign.. On April 5, 1242, one of Russia's most famous battles, the Battle of the Ice, took place on the ice of Lake Peipsi. The battle was a significant defeat sustained by the crusaders during the Northern Crusades. The crusaders' defeat in the battle marked the end of their campaigns against the Orthodox Novgorod Republic and other Russian territories for the next century.  Results  The Germans withdrew from Pskov and Novgorod. Under the terms of the peace treaty, the Livonians pledged to return to Novgorod Meadow, Latgale, the land of Vod.

She was one of the popular Softdrinks Beauties introduced in the 1980s along with Sarsi Emmanuelle and Coca Nicolas. She was known for films such as Brown Emanuelle (1981), The Victim (1982), Krus sa Bawat Punglo (1982), Virgin People (1983), Snake Sisters (1983), Naked Island (1984), Matukso kaya ang Anghel? (1984) and Room 69 (1985). Career Born Delia Dueñas Smith, Paloma was the eldest daughter of Lydia Dueñas, a native of Borac, Northern Samar, and an American letter carrier, Kenneth Smith, who abandoned his family when the children were still young. When she was 14 years old, a talent scout named Tita Ester brought Paloma to talent manager Rey dela Cruz in 1980 for a possible film career. In 1981, she made her debut in the movie Brown Emmanuelle. She was given the stage name Pepsi Paloma and was promoted as one of the members of the so-called “soft drink” beauties together with Coca Nicolas and Sarsi Emmanuel. Rape case and aftermath After appearing in a handful of films, Paloma was involved in a highly-publicized scandal when she accused comedians Vic Sotto, Joey de Leon, and Ricardo \\"Richie D'Horsie\\" Reyes of rape. According to Paloma's account, she and fellow actress Guada Guarin were drugged and then brought to a room at the Sulô Hotel in Quezon City where the rape happened. Actor and future senator Tito Sotto who is also Vic's older brother, soon became involved and compelled Paloma to drop the charges by allegedly intimidating her with a gun. Sotto had drawn up an Affidavit of Desistance and obtained her signature, although some newspaper reports stated that it was Pepsi's mother who signed the document on her behalf. Had the suspects been convicted of the charges, they would face death penalty—execution by electric chair, the same fate that befell three of four convicted rapists in actress Maggie de la Riva's case two decades prior. According to a now-unpublished article by the Philippine Daily Inquirer, it was also around this time that Paloma was reported missing and was found being held captive by convicted felon Bienvenido \\"Ben Ulo\\" Mendoza, a relative of the Sottos. Despite his arrest and confession, there is no record that Ben Ulo was ever charged with any crime connected with the abduction of Pepsi Paloma. Although the three suspects have initially denied Paloma's accusations, they later issued a public apology, on their knees on live TV and in an article published by the People's Journal on October 13, 1982, saying “We hope that you will not allow the error we have committed against you to stand as a stumbling block to that future which we all look forward to. We, therefore, ask you to find it in your heart to pardon us for the wrong which we have done against you.” Due to the signed Affidavit of Desistance, Paloma did not pursue her complaint and the case did not go to court. A year after the scandal, Paloma starred in a film called The Victim where she played the role of a woman taken advantage of, reflecting the controversies of her personal life. Although the film catapulted Paloma to wider recognition, media attention and gossip from film critics served to cast her testimony as a true-life rape victim into doubt. Accusations were made that her manager Rey de la Cruz orchestrated the whole issue to exploit the actress' popularity. Death On May 31, 1985, Paloma was found dead in her apartment, in an apparent suicide by hanging. According to police investigation, the rape case was one factor of her suicide. A diary, citing monetary problems and anxieties over her relationship with her mother and her boyfriend, was found in her bedroom, although the authenticity of the journal entries have been questioned, especially by her manager Babette \\" Babe\\" Corcuerra who claims she is actually earning well. The mysteries surrounding the case and Paloma's death were alleged to be immortalized in the popular Eraserheads song \\"Spoliarium\\". Aftermath Despite the suspects' earlier apology, Tito Sotto has maintained his position against any involvement in the whitewashing of the rape case and alleges that the scandal was a gimmick by Paloma's party for publicity. Sotto said that he was not involved as a perpetrator in the rape of Paloma and he denied using his position in government to influence the court decision. Sotto became Vice Mayor in Quezon City in 1988 before being elected as a Senator in 1992. In 2018, the elder Sotto requested The Philippine Inquirer to remove published articles available online mentioning the Pepsi Paloma Case, claiming them to be \\"fake news\\" and damaging to his current reputation as a Senator.

Following regime change in 1933, his party was banned and he fled. He lived in various countries before settling in the Soviet Union, where in 1936 he was briefly arrested. He was arrested again in 1937 in one of Stalin's political purges. He was detained for the next seven years and is believed to have died in a labour camp in the northern part of European Russia during the Autumn of 1944. Life Paul Franken was born in Höhscheid (Solingen), some 40 km (25 miles) east of Düsseldorf in the by this time heavily industrialised Ruhr region of Germany. His father was a foundry worker. Franken attended school locally and in 1908 started training as a specialist metal worker (Former & Nadler). In 1911 he joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD / Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands) and in 1914 he was conscripted for military service. In 1917 he joined the newly formed Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD / Unabhängige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands) which had broken away from the mainstream SPD, primarily over the issue of whether or not to continue supporting funding for the war which had broken out in July/August 1914. During the revolutionary period that followed the end of the war Franken was a member of Workers' and Soldiers' Councils in the Solingen district. On the political left there was further factionalism and fragmentation during the years that followed, and by 1920 Franken was an activist member of the Communist Party. It was probably around this time, in 1920, that he married the fellow left-wing activist, Flora Goldberg (1899–1991). In June 1920 he stood, unsuccessfully, for election to the Reichstag as a Communist Party candidate. In January 1921 he joined the Communist Work Community (party - KAG / Kommunistische Arbeitsgemeinschaft) but this movement proved short-lived, and by May 1922 he was back in the USPD. In the meantime, he was elected a member of the Prussian Landtag (regional legislative assembly) where he sat till 1924, and again between 1928 and 1933. In the meantime, in 1922 he switched his party affiliation back to the SPD. In addition, between 1922 he was working as a writer and newspaper editor in Solingen. In 1924 the couple relocated to Zeitz, some 450 km (280 miles) to the east, where Flora Franken, who joined the SPD in 1925 sat on the district council till 1933. Paul Franken became a member of the SPD local leadership team in Zeitz where from November 1924 he was also editing the SPD daily newspaper, (Zeitzer) \\"Volksbote\\". He was active in the cultural and educational fields, working in the SPD's Reichsarbeitsgemeinschaft der Kinderfreunde / RAG (loosely National Children's Friendly Society). In 1928, after a break of four years, he returned to the Landtag (Prussian regional legislative assembly). The Nazi Party took power in January 1933 and lost little time in transforming the country into a one-party state. During 1933 Paul Franken's membership of the Landtag (Prussian regional legislative assembly), like the assembly itself, came to an end after a few months.Siegfried Heimann: Der Preußische Landtag 1899–1947. Eine politische Geschichte. Ch. Links Verlag, Berlin 2011, Flora Franken, who was both Jewish and a Socialist, had even more reason to fear the Nazis than her husband, and emigrated to Riga, joining her mother in Latvia. Paul Franken either accompanied her or emigrated via Czechoslovakia. Either way, they were both in Latvia when Kārlis Ulmanis in May 1934 took power, obliging them to escape from a new single party right-wing dictatorship for the second time in less than two years. They moved to Sweden, and applied for permission to emigrate to the Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities granted their application in August 1934 and they moved to Leningrad (as St. Petersburg was known at that time). In Leningrad Paul Franken worked at the vast Putilov Factory. In May 1936 he was accepted back into the German Communist Party, now overwhelmingly exiled, its members based mostly in Paris or Moscow. In November 1937 he was arrested by the NKVD and detained, in the context of a great surge in political purges taking place that year. He was taken to one of the network of Labour Camps located inside the Arctic Circle. Here, under appalling conditions, his life ended in the Autumn of 1944 in the labour camp at Adak near Vorkuta. Flora Franken, who had accompanied her husband to the Soviet Union in 1934, was permitted to return to the German Democratic Republic with her son, Peter, in May 1955. She took a job with Dietz Verlag (the Berlin publishing house), later switching to the (closely associated) Marxism- Leninism Institute of East Germany's ruling Socialist Unity Party (Central Committee).

The film was produced and distributed by Babelsberg Studio. The film was marketed with the tagline \\"Your hardest opponent is yourself\\" (\\"Dein schwerster Gegner bist du selbst.\\") Plot Bruno (Hakan Orbeyi) is a lonely, unhappy, 400-pound man that has recently lost his railroad job on his 30th birthday, and was informed by a tax-collecting bailiff (Hans-Jochen Röhrig) that he's in danger of losing his home due to very late payments. That same day, Bruno's shifty and opportunistic friend, Kalle (Oliver Korittke), who loses a job for the third time in a year, has intentions to enter his overweight friend into the upcoming Sumo World championship that is being held in the city of Riesa, hoping that the fifty thousand marks purse will changed their lives for the better. Later that night, Kalle talks Bruno into a double-date with Gina (Esther Esche) and Bärbel (Sandra Steffi), and going to the local discothèque, Lucky's Temple of Dance. Feeling out of place, Bruno goes to the men's restroom, where he meets the beautiful Anna (Julia Richter), who's hiding from her boneheaded boyfriend, Lucky (Tim Wilde), the owner of the club. Unbeknownst to Bruno, Kalle's plan was to volunteer his strong, heavyset buddy into a sumo wrestling contest, to show Bruno that he's good at it, and the winner gets a prize for two hundred marks. As expected, Bruno mops-up the inferior competition and wins the prize, but unexpectedly, he's challenged by Lucky to a boxing match. Bruno timidly decides to relinquish the prize rather than take part in an unnecessary public display of physicality, so an obliviously agitated Kalle wisely decides to leave the club with Bruno in tow. Kalle does all he can to try to convince his big-bodied partner that his destiny is sumo, but after the contest fiasco, Bruno doesn't want to hear it. The next morning, due to circumstances involving a ten year old, chubby, bullied boy named Timo (Thomas Drechsel), Bruno finally decides to enter the sumo championship. Bruno is invited by Timo to meets his dance trained mother, who turns out to be the same Anna that was at the club last night. One thing leads to another, and Anna is intrigued by Timo sudden friendliness with Bruno, and the two agreed to get to know each other over dinner. Later on, Bruno informs Kalle that he's had a change of heart and is entering the championship, and the excited Kalle springs into action to seek out a proper sumo coach. Kalle introduces the very German, but Japanese-loving sushi chef Akashi (Martin Seifert) to Bruno and Timo. At first, Akashi is dismissive of Bruno who doesn't appear to have the heart, skill or dedication to be a good sumo wrestler, but after pleads from Kalle and Bruno, Akashi changes his mind and instructs the trio gather there to begin constructing a dohyō, so Bruno can begin his training. Despite the fact that complications have arisen, like clashes with Akashi, money problems and obvious attraction for Anna, Bruno does himself proud with qualifying in the preliminary and will represent Germany as one of two German participants along with menacing rival R.F. Schröder (Jörg Brümmer). Unknowingly to Bruno, Kalle is in trouble because he owes money to a loan shark, and the ill-temper Lucky's jealousy of Anna for spending time with the big hearted sumotori-in-making, eventually drives Anna and Timo away. Kalle's machinations to boost his very large friend's popularity and make some money ends-up backfiring badly, with the end result seriously damaging Bruno's confidence which negatively impacts his blossoming relationship with Anna and Timo. Bruno is left directionless at this point and the sumo championship is the next day. Fate intervenes, and after much soul- searching, Bruno smartly decides to go back to Akashi and pleads for his help. Akashi accepts and prepares Bruno for the sporting event. While, Akashi, Kalle and Gina are there supporting Bruno, Anna and Timo are preparing to leave Riesa, when the brutish Lucky shows-up and tries in vain to change Anna and Timo's minds in returning home with him. Bruno progresses to the finale to face-off against the current world champion, Emanuel Yarbrough of the U.S.A. Before it can happen, Bruno decides to find Anna and Timo, and arrives in time to put the very arrogant Lucky in his place once and for all. Bruno and Anna make amends, and the three depart for the arena so Bruno can battle Yarbrough. Akashi, Kalle, Gina, Anna and Timo looked on with anticipation as Bruno and Yarbrough intensely wrestled. At first, the two giants seemed to be equally matched until Yarbrough manages a concentrated, one-armed throw of Bruno to the ground, which costs him the match, handing the championship to Yarbrough. Lifting by the audience rapturous applause to such a fantastic effort, Bruno graciously bows to the champion, and walks away from the arena with his head held high, knowing that despite the outcome, he's truly a winner in his heart, mind and soul.

It was not about raising the pity of the audience and even less about pushing the topic of being overweight. I was looking for a metaphor. Sumo is such a metaphor. It's a sport the first rule of which says: The fatter, the better...\\" Krawinkel comments on casting: \\"For the main role of Sumo Bruno, I was looking for an overweight actor with an erotic appeal. Consciously, I wanted to cast the role in contrast to the cliché \\"being fat is being flabby and disgusting\\". The first actors that I saw weighed about 220 pounds and didn't come up to my idea of a credible sumo wrestler. My Bruno was to weigh at least 300 pounds, a condition which reduced our choices considerably. The team and I soon realized that if we wanted a German for the role, he would have to be an amateur actor. One night, when we were leaving a cinema in Hanover, my wife said to me: \\"Look at him over there, that's Sumo Bruno for you\\". The gigantic Hakan Orbeyi was sitting on a bar stool, wearing a muscle shirt when the outdoor temperature was five degrees Celsius. I immediately went over to him and introduced myself. While we were talking, a girl came up, kissed him and said: \\"See you later\\". A few minutes later, another girl came along. She was given a tender hug, and I thought: \\"Here, at last, is an overweight person who's really at ease with himself\\". While it was Krawinkel intentions to tell his story of one person's belief that he can overcome any obstacle to better himself and fully believed that the sport of sumo wrestling would be a great source of inspiration, he didn't think it would be a problem for the officials at the International Sumo Federation (ISF) in Japan, but it became an issue. The Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun had reported that the ISF were very annoyed that “they let the leading actor smuggled into the arena and shot the scene with him leading the German team and parading around at the Opening Ceremony. Can you imagine doing anything like that at any other sport's World Championship events?,\\" fumed an official at the Japan Sumo Federation official.” Because of this the ISF officials “did not allow Japanese sumo wrestlers to take part in the movie since it was unhappy with the humorous and unconventional portrayal of a German sumo wrestler.”  Music  The score was composed and conducted by Biber Gullatz and Eckes Malz, and was produced and mixed in the First Take Studios, Weinheim. The opening and ending song \\"What I Wish to Be\\" (lyrics by Deborah Wargon), was sung by the Children's and Youth Choir of the Theaters of the City Heidelberg, headed by Heike Kiefner. Release Sumo Bruno was theatrically released on January 18, 2001 in Germany, but previously played at multiple film festivals: Montreal World Film Festival on September 2, 2000; Singapore International Film Festival in 2000; Kinofest Linen on November 17, 2000, and Gothenburg Film Festival in 2001. A DVD of the film was released on October 20, 2008 by Senator Home Entertainment. Reception Sumo Bruno has received generally favorable reviews from viewers. In the Variety magazine, Eddie Cockerel states that \\"Sumo Bruno aims for underdog charm as a rural lad becomes a decent sumo against wildly improbable odds. Yet too-gentle fantasy is less than sum of its parts, more a series of good ideas about friendship and determination than cohesive, dramatic sports saga.\\" Other reviewers had opined that the film was \\"Germany’s answer to The Full Monty (1997) - absolutely gorgeous!\\", and that it is \\"a light, but immensely satisfying film\\", also calling it an \\"underrated German movie with a big star.\\" ReferencesExternal links 2000 films 2000s comedy-drama films German comedy- drama films German films German-language films Professional wrestling films 2000 comedy films 2001 comedy films 2000 drama films 2001 drama films ","title":"Sumo Bruno"},{"id":"48486733","text":"Love and Trumpets () is a 1925 German silent comedy film directed by Richard Eichberg and starring Lilian Harvey, Harry Liedtke, and Harry Halm.

In a racing career which lasted from 2009 until 2013 he won six of his twenty-five races. As a two-year-old in 2009 he was undefeated in three races and was voted Japanese Champion two-year-old colt. In the following year he won the Kobe Shimbun Hai and finished second in both the Satsuki Sho and the Tokyo Yushun before being awarded the Japan Cup on the disqualification of Buena Vista. He won only once in sixteen subsequent starts and was retired from racing in 2013. Background Rose Kingdom is a dark bay or brown horse with a small white star standing 1.63 metres bred in Japan by Northern Farm. His sire, King Kamehameha was one of the best Japanese colts of his generation, beating a field including Heart's Cry and Daiwa Major in the 2004 Japanese Derby. His other winners as a breeding stallion include Lord Kanaloa, Lovely Day, Belshazzar (Japan Cup Dirt), Rulership (Queen Elizabeth II Cup) and Apapane. Rose Kingdom's dam Rosebud won three races including the Grade II Fillies' Revue and finished second in the Oka Sho, Yushun Himba and Queen Elizabeth II Commemorative Cup. She was a descendant of the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches winner Riverqueen. During his racing career Rose Kingdom was owned by the Sunday Racing Co Ltd and was trained by Kojiro Hashiguchi. Racing career=2009: two-year-old season On his racecourse debut, Rose Kingdom contested a maiden race over 1800 metres at Kyoto Racecourse on 25 October and won from Victoire Pisa and nine others. In the following month he was stepped up in class for the Grade III Tokyo Sports Hai Nisai Stakes and won from Tosen Phantom. On 20 December, Rose Kingdom was moved up to Grade I class for Japan's most prestigious race for two-year-olds, the Asahi Hai Futurity Stakes over 1600 metres at Nakayama Racecourse. Ridden by the 42-year-old Futoshi Komaki, he won by one and a quarter lengths from Eishin Apollon (later to win the Mile Championship) with Daiwa Barbarian two lengths back in third. After the race Komaki explained \\"He was very relaxed from the moment he set foot on the course today... He's such an easy ride and I just hope I can keep winning the big races with him. At my age, I'm a veteran in most people's eyes, but I haven't won that many big races yet\\". In the JRA Awards for 2009, Rose Kingdom was awarded the title of Japanese Champion two-year-old colt taking 285 of the 287 votes. 2010: three-year-old season On his first appearance as a three-year-old Rose Kingdom sustained his first defeat when he finished third behind Aliseo and Gestalt in the Grade II Fuji TV Sho Spring Stakes over 1800 metres at Nakayama on 21 March. In April he contested the Grade I Satsuki Sho over 2000 metres and finished fourth behind Victoire Pisa, Hiruno d'Amour and Eishin Flash. On 30 May he was one of seventeen colts to contest the Tokyo Yushun and finished second by a neck to Eishin Flash with Victoire Pisa in third. After a break of almost four months, Rose Kingdom returned in the Grade II Kobe Shimbun Hai over 2400 metres at Hanshin Racecourse on 26 September. Ridden by Yutaka Take he recorded his first win of the year as he defeated Eishin Flash by a neck with Big Week three length back in third place. In the Grade I Kikuka Sho at Kyoto on 24 October, Rose Kingdom was moved up in distance to 3000 metres and finished second to Big Week, with Beat Black in third. The 30th running of the Japan Cup in front of 106,322 at Tokyo on 28 November attracted eighteen runners and Rose Kingdom, ridden by Take, started the 7.8/1 second favourite behind Buena Vista (a filly also owned by Sunday Racing) and the three-year-old filly Pelusa. The overseas challenge comprised Fifty Proof from Canada, Voila Ici (Premio Roma, Gran Premio di Milano) from Italy, Cirrus des Aigles, Marinous (Grand Prix de Deauville) and Timos from France, Joshua Tree from Ireland and Dandino (King George V Stakes) from Britain. The other Japanese-trained runners included Nakayama Festa, Eishin Flash, Oken Bruce Lee (2008 Kikuka Sho) and Jaguar Mail (Tenno Sho spring). Take settled the colt in fifth place and switched from the rail position to make a challenge on the outside in the straight. He was bumped when Buena Vista cut to the inside but recovered to take second place, one and three quarter lengths behind the filly and a nose ahead of Victoire Pisa. After a 24-minute stewards inquiry Buena Vista was disqualified for causing interference and the race was awarded to Rose Kingdom. His trainer admitted to having \\"mixed feelings\\" about the result but praised the colt saying \\"being bumped a few times didn’t faze him, and he put in another effort even after that to finish second. He's always had guts but the determination he showed today was amazing.\\" Plans to for the colt to end his season in the Arima Kinen were abandoned when he developed colic two days before the race. In the JRA Awards for 2010, Rose Kingdom finished second to Victoire Pisa in the voting for Japanese Champion three-year-old colt. 2011: four-year-old season Rose Kingdom began his four-year-old season by finishing third to Rulership in a Grade II race at Kyoto in January and then finished third again in the Grade II Nikkei Sho at Hanshin in April. When moved back up to Grade I class he finished down the field behind Hiruno d'Amour in the spring running of the Tenno Sho and then ran fourth to Earnestly in the Takarazuka Kinen. He started his autumn campaign in the Grade II Kyoto Daishoten on 9 October. Ridden by Hiroki Goto, he was made the odds-on favourite and won from Beat Black, Oken Bruce Lee and Jaguar Mail. Goto commented: \\"I think he has grown up and he feels better than he did when I rode him to finish second in last year's Derby.\\" Rose Kingdom made little subsequent impact that year, finishing unplaced in the autumn Tenno Sho, the Japan Cup and the Arima Kinen. 2012 & 2013: later career Rose Kingdom remained in training for two further seasons, competing in many of Japan's top races, but had no further successes. In 2012 he managed one fourth place from six starts, but in the following year he finished well down the field in both of his races as a six-year-old. Stud record Rose Kingdom was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion. For the 2015 season he was based at the Breedeers Stallion Station.

At that time, the trains from Madras terminated at the Bangalore Cantonment Railway Station, in Bangalore Civil and Military Station which was controlled by the British Madras Presidency. The Bangalore City station in the Bangalore Pete (under the control of the Maharaja of Mysore), was used to connect to Mysore State. The railway line has existed since starting operations in 1864, with the launch of the Bangalore Cantonment - Jolarpettai train services by the Madras Railway. The train line was broad- gauge and 149 km long, connecting the Bangalore Cantonment with Vellore district. Recent developments Recently in a bid to give a face-lift to the Bangalore East Railway Station, the Indian Railways started 5 new booking counters at the station. As the Express trains do not halt at this station, there has been a long-standing demand from residents of the surrounding suburbs of Fraser Town, Cox Town, Bharathinagar, Sevanagar, Jeevanahalli, Banaswadi and Kammanahalli, for all trains to stop at this station. As they are being forced to use the Bangalore Cantonment Railway Station, which is located at a distance.

Route The U4 is the newest line of the Hamburg U-Bahn and the first line that is to form as a branch of an older, existing line. It shares the U2's tracks from Billstedt to the major transfer station Jungfernstieg, located in the city center, branching off 165 meters before the station and stopping at the outer tracks of the four-platform station. It then traverses under the Neustadt in a far- swinging 180° bend and reaches the newly built Überseequartier station in HafenCity after about 3 kilometers. The following station, HafenCity Universität lies about 650 meters to the east in the Elbtorquartier. In December 7, 2018, the line was extended 1.3 km eastward, to a new terminus at Elbbrücken, allowing for a future S-Bahn connection with lines S3/S31. The line runs almost entirely underground, only surfacing at Elbbrücken and Billstedt at both ends. There is also a short uncovered section east of Burgstraße.

The temple is constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture. Vishnu is worshipped as Vaikunta Perumal and his consort Lakshmi as Anandavalli. The temple was originally built by Pallavan, with later additions from the Chola. The temple is known for the inscriptions indicating the democratic practises of electing representatives for the village bodies during the regime of Parantaka Chola (907-55 CE). The building is declared as a heritage monument and administered by the Archeological Survey of India. Rajiv Gandhi, the then Prime Minister of India was inspired by the system after paying a visit to the temple and insisted on improving Panchayat Raj, India's system of local bodies in villages. History Inscriptions on the walls of the temple Uthiramerur was ruled by the Pallavas, Cholas, Pandyas, Sambuvaraya, Vijayanagara Rayas and Nayaks. As per the inscriptions in the temple, the Pallava king Nandivarman II (Pallavamalla) 730–795 CE established the village around 750 A.D. It is believed that he donated the village to Vedic Brahmins from Srivaishanva community. The Cholas captured the region and it came under their dominion during the later part of 9th century. There are inscriptions from the period of Parantaka Chola I (907–950), Rajaraja Chola I (985–1014), Rajendra Chola I (1012–1044) and Kulothunga Chola I (1070–1120) indicating various gifts to the temples. The process of democratically electing the local representatives through a system called Kudavolai during the Chola regime is documented in the inscriptions. The temple is known for the inscriptions indicating the democratic practises of electing representatives for the village bodies during the regime of Parantaka Chola. The region and the village went under the sway of Pandyas during the 13th century and subsequently to the Telugu Chola ruler Vijaya Gandagopala. During the later period, the village switched hands to Pallava chieftains, Telugu Cholas, Samburavarayars and finally Kumara Kampana. The Vijayanagara emperor Krishnadevaraya (1502–29) made contributions to the Vaikunta temple, Subhramanya temple and Kailasanatha temple in the village. The temple is declared as a heritage monument and administered by the Archeological Survey of India. Architecture The main shrine of the temple Vaikunta Perumal temple covers an area of about . The sanctum houses the image of Vaikuntanatha in seated posture with Sridevi and Bhudevi on his either sides. There is an assembly hall . The roof of the temple rests on the walls and there are no pillars. The inscriptions from the Chola period are made on the walls of the assembly hall. Kulothunga Chola is believed to have built the roof of the assembly hall that made it an assembly hall along with the temple. As per another view, the entire structure was originally an assembly hall and it collapsed during the regime of Kulothunga Chola. He rebuilt the assembly hall along with the temple housing the image of Vaikunta Perumal in it. Some of the inscriptions also read that the village was planned as per Agamic texts with the assembly hall in the centre of the village and the temples of the village built around it. Kudavolai system Stucco image of Narasimha seen on the vimana The inscriptions of the temple indicate that the villagers requested the rulers to allow them to choose their own representatives. Parantaka Chola readily acceded to their demand and instituted the Kudavolai system (ballot) of democratically electing the village representatives. The rules of electing and the eligibility of the representatives and voters are described in detail in the inscriptions. The villagers assembled at a common place and wrote the name of their preferred representative in a palm leaf and put it in a pot. kudam in Tamil is pot and volai means the palm leaf, leading to the name of Kudavolai. Only people in pilgrimage or senescence were exempt from voting. The eligibility of the candidates were prescribed with minimum age, educational qualifications and property. There were strictures for the candidates should have built their house in their own property, should not be part of any other committee and be between 35 and 70 years of age. The voters had the right to call back their candidate for failing their duties. The inscriptions also specified strict punishments for the corrupt like disallowing their next seven generations to contest if found guilty. The institution was dismembered along with the ending of Chola regime during the 13th century.

It is situated near Banur town in district SAS Nagar, Mohali. As per 2011 census of government of India population of this village is 2160 out of which number of male and female was 1143 and 1017 respectively. (S. No. 92). Village pond Motemajra is a very popular and well known for having a very large pond, which attracts a large number of migratory birds in winter season every year. These birds start to arrive in November and leave in March. Total area of the village is 400 Hectares(S no. 92). Area of the Pond is 32 acres and it is the one of the biggest ponds available in the villages of the Punjab State. This village pond is known as \\"Kalyanpur Dhaab\\" in the local area named after a famous saint \\"Kalyan Ji\\" of the village. In vernacular Punjabi Language, Dhaab is known as a medium size water body, bigger than pond and smaller than a lake. History and background This village pond is known as \\"Kalyanpur Dhaab\\" in the local area named after a famous saint \\"Kalyan Ji\\" of the village. In vernacular Punjabi language, Dhaab is known as a medium size water body, bigger than pond and smaller than a lake. Originally the pond was created to preserve rain water for irrigation and livestock drinking purposes when modern means of irrigation was not developed. Water of seasonal streams and drains approaching from Shivalik Hills was also accumulated here for these purposes. Later this became a sizable and sustainable water body and as a result migratory birds started visiting her in every winter season. Migratory birds Availability of adequate water in the pond, sufficient open surrounding and favourable climatic conditions in the village attract a large number and varieties of migratory birds here every year. These include mainly Common Pochard, Coots, Brahmini Ducks, Purple Moor Hen, Red Crested Pochard, Pin Tail Duck, Cormorants, Wigeons Duck or Blue Winged Duck and Garganey Duck. These birds migrate from Russia, China, Siberia and few other adjoining European countries. Numbers of these migratory birds arriving here every year are reported in thousands but this number is declining due to various climatic hazards and economic exploitation of the pond. Present status Although a large number of migratory birds visit this pond every year yet their number is reported to be declining every year. One of the main reason for it may be exploitation of the pond for economic purpose by the village level local administration i.e. village panchyat. The Pond is leased out to fishermen in winter and for Sangharra (ਸੰਘਾੜਾ) cultivation in summer by the village panchyat every year. This causes fear and many other hurdles to the birds. Pollution of water may be another reason for it ReferencesGalleryMigratory birds at Village Pond Motemajra, SAS Nagar, Punjab,India (2015) File:Village Pond Motemajra, SAS Nagar , Punjab,India 11.JPG File:Village Pond Motemajra, SAS Nagar , Punjab,India 10.JPG File:Village Pond Motemajra, SAS Nagar , Punjab,India 09.JPG File:Migratory birds in Village Pond Motemajra, SAS Nagar , Punjab,India 07.JPG File:Migratory birds in Village Pond Motemajra, SAS Nagar , Punjab,India 06.JPG File:Migratory birds in Village Pond Motemajra, SAS Nagar , Punjab,India 03.JPG File:Migratory birds in Village Pond Motemajra, SAS Nagar , Punjab,India 02.JPG File:Migratory birds in Village Pond Motemajra, SAS Nagar , Punjab,India 05.JPG File:Village Pond Motemajra, SAS Nagar , Punjab,India 12.JPG File:Migratory birds in Village Pond Motemajra, SAS Nagar , Punjab,India 04.JPG File:Migratory Birds at Motemajra Pond, Punjab, India.jpgMigratory Birds at Motemajra Pond, Punjab, India File:Migratory Birds Motemajra village pond, Punjab.jpg(7 June 2016) File:Flmingo at village Pond ,Motemajra, Punjab.jpg File:Village Pond ,Motemajra, Punjab.jpg =2017 (Feb)= File:Bar headed geese,Motemajra pond ,Punjab.jpg File:Grey Heron with fish catch, Motemajra pond, Punjab.jpg File:Bar headed geese,Motemajra pond, Punjab,India.jpg File:Bar headed geese,Motemajraia pond, Punjab,.jpg Migratory birds at Motemajra Village pond 2020Feb 2020= File:Migratory birds at Motemajra Village pond 01.jpg File:Migratory birds at Motemajra Village pond 02.jpg File:Migratory birds at Motemajra Village pond 03.jpg File:Migratory birds at Motemajra Village pond 04.jpg File:Migratory birds at Motemajra Village pond 05.jpg File:Migratory birds at Motemajra Village pond 06.jpg File:Migratory birds at Motemajra Village pond 07.jpg File:Migratory birds at Motemajra Village pond 08.jpg File:Migratory birds at Motemajra Village pond 09.jpg = Aug 2020= File:Pheasant tailed Jacana , Motemajra Pond , Punjab.jpgPheasant tailed Jacana File:Motemajra village pond -Aug 2020 02.jpgMotemajra village pond, Sanghara crop visible in pond File:Motemajra village pond -Aug 2020 01.jpgMotemajra village pond,Sanghara crop visible in pond Villages in Sahibzada Ajit Singh Nagar district Birdwatching sites in India ","title":"Motemajra Village Pond"},{"id":"48487124","text":"Navdeep Amarjeet Saini (born 23 November 1992) is an Indian cricketer who has played for Delhi since 2013.

In 1919 Weyland published the novel Hie Kreuz - hie Triglaff (The Cross against the Triglav), which gives a chauvinistic account of the historical events of the tenth century A.D. in Pomerania. It ends with an open allusion to the contemporary conflicts between Germans and Poles in Upper Silesia. A second book Der Tanz als kulturelles Ausdrucksmittel (Dancing as an expression of culture) was promised, with a chapter on modern dance as a sign of cultural decline. However this book never appeared and Weyland was to move on to scientific theory. Weyland was a key figure involved in organising an anti- semitic campaign against relativity. In August 1920 he organised a mass meeting at the Berliner Philharmonie to contest Einstein's theory of relativity. After ensuring the meeting had been well-advertised in the newspapers, Weyland delivered a vituperative attack on Einstein, described as \\"with heavy artillery\\" in one newspaper. This attack consisted primarily of unsubstantial insults against the theory of relativity alongside claims that it was promoted by \\"the clique of [Einstein's] academic supporters\\". Weyland claimed that the theory constituted a form of hypnotic mass suggestion and Jewish arrogance, which was a product of an unsettling spiritually chaotic period and that it, amongst other repellent ideas, was poisoning German thought. It was this speech which culminated in the statement: \\"Relativity theory is scientific Dadaism\\". He was later granted American citizenship.

Its headquarters is in Phuket, Thailand, and it has been legally registered in Thailand, the United States, Canada, Australia, France, United Kingdom, Switzerland, and The Netherlands. Its primary goal is to care for homeless and abused dogs in Thailand. It was established by British couple John and Gill Dalley with the help of Margot Homburg Park in Phuket in 2003. The foundation has saved thousands of dogs from illegal trades, particularly for meat, and tries to reduce free-ranging dog populations through sterilisation. Soi is a Thai word for \\"street\\", a reference to the fact that smaller streets in Thailand often teem with stray dogs. The sterilisation programme has been extended to stray cats. It gets support from international celebrities including Dame Judi Dench, Laura Carmichael, and Ricky Gervais. The foundation's 2014 campaign led to the enactment of the Prevention of Animal Cruelty and Provision of Animal Welfare Act, the first animal welfare act in Thailand. Background and origin Thailand, and other countries in Southeast Asia, are known for their stray dogs and, until 2014, the dog meat trade. Whilst the trade became illegal in Thailand, in other countries in the region such as Vietnam and Cambodia, there are dog butchers, dog tanneries, and holding centres for captive canines. Many dogs were exported to Vietnam and China for dog meat. The dog trade involves smuggling by organised gangs. Thailand's largest island, Phuket, is the major centre of such activities, and is the home of many stray dogs. The Thai Veterinary Medical Association reported that in 2011, half a million dogs were traded to Vietnam and China. These dogs are trapped and collected to be sold in the market or passed on to traders for export. The animals often suffer during transport due to congested packing in crates, and many of them suffocate and die in the process. Seeing this appalling situation, American-born Margot Homburg Park decided to join hands with a British couple, John and Gill Dalley, to try to end the suffering of dogs in Thailand. John Dalley is a retired chemical engineer from Leeds, England, and Gill a former bank employee. Gill Dalley died after a short illness on February 13, 2017. The couple had moved to Phuket for a retired life. John Dalley remarked, \\"We had a dog back home [in Leeds], but I wasn't particularly involved with animal rights. But you see these dogs [in Thailand] suffer, and you want to do something to help them.\\" In 2003 they established the foundation by opening a clinic and recruiting veterinarians on a volunteer basis to take care of homeless dogs. For their name, they chose the Thai word soi, which means \\"street\\", hence, the organisation literally means \\"street dog foundation\\". They began by neutering and vaccinating stray dogs. In 2004, following the catastrophic Indian Ocean tsunami which devastated both human and animal populations in the region, Soi Dog's presence became even more valuable. In 2005, the foundation was officially registered, becoming the first animal welfare organisation in Thailand. In 2011, a permanent clinic was opened in Bangkok, the nation's capital. The foundation's mission is 'To improve the welfare of dogs and cats in Asia, resulting in better lives for both the animal and human communities, to create a society without homeless animals, and to ultimately end animal cruelty'. As a result of its vaccination effort, Phuket has seen only one confirmed case of rabies since 1995. Activity Following the outlawing of the dog meat trade in Thailand in 2014, the foundation has focused its efforts on spaying and neutering as many dogs as possible. Spay/neuter is widely recognised as the most humane, effective, and sustainable method of controlling the stray population. Soi Dog neuters over 100,000 stray dogs every year to reduce the population living on the streets. It keeps around 1,100 homeless dogs and cats under care. In Phuket, due to the reduction in the stray dog population (over 90% since 2003) the Soi Dog Foundation has actually neutered more cats than dogs on the island since 2015. Support British celebrities Judi Dench, Laura Carmichael, Peter Egan, Penelope Wilton and Ricky Gervais launched a public campaign to support the causes of the foundation in 2014. The campaign was a success in terms of political action. The National Assembly of Thailand passed its first Animal Welfare Bill on 13 December 2014. On 27 December, the government enacted the Prevention of Animal Cruelty and Provision of Animal Welfare Act, which was the first animal welfare act in Thailand. Ambassadors Apart from the officials in the foundation, honorary ambassadors include Naomi Bromley, a British Vegan campaigner; Dena Kaplan, an Australian actress, singer, and dancer; Natalie Glebova, a Russian-Canadian model, writer, and holder of the Miss Universe 2005 title; and Kyle Leask, an autistic boy, and his dog Miracle, winner of the Eukanuba Friends For Life award.

Built in 1983 in Brazil and christened MV Gulf Grain, she sailed as a bulk carrier under various names and flags until she was acquired in 2009 to be converted into a Powership in Turkey. The Powership supplied electricity to the power grid in Pakistan, then in Basra, Iraq.

The vessel is registered under the Liberian flag with homeport Monrovia. In November 2010 the Powership with 216 MW generation power set sail to Karachi, Pakistan also carrying humanitarian aid for the victims of the 2010 Pakistan floods. She bridged electricity shortage supplying around 20% of the power demand of the 12-million population city of Karachi for a five-year term. The Powership burns heavy fuel oil (HFO), the only available energy resource in Pakistan. After serving in Pakistan, the Powership supplied electricity to Iraq.

It was originally published as a four-issue limited series in the United States by Dark Horse Comics and Archie Comics in 2015. The single issues were released between April and July, a hardcover collection went on sale in November 2015, and a paperback collection became available in August 2019. Following in a long tradition of 'all- American' teenager Archie Andrews meeting unusual celebrities and pop culture icons, this comic book shows him meeting 'the galaxy's deadliest hunter', the Predator. The idea was first suggested in the Archie office and then proposed to Dark Horse, which holds the license to comics featuring the Predator character owned by 20th Century Fox. The companies paired de Campi, a horror writer at Dark Horse, with Ruiz, a regular Archie artist. When the comic book was announced, many media outlets noted in their headlines that the new title was not a joke. In Archie vs. Predator, a trophy-hunting alien arrives on Earth and begins stalking high school student Archie Andrews and his classmates. After a number of teenagers have been murdered, the survivors realize they are being hunted and decide to fight back. The book received positive reviews from critics, who enjoyed the strange crossover matchup and dark humor. The miniseries was the bestselling book for both publishers during its release and won a Ghastly Award for Best Limited Series. A sequel, Archie vs. Predator II, began in July 2019 written by de Campi and illustrated by Robert Hack. Publication history=Development Since Archie Comics partnered with Marvel Comics for the 1994 one-shot comic Archie Meets the Punisher, the Archie characters have had a tradition of team-ups with characters from other fictional universes.Aguirre-Sacasa, Roberto (introduction). Following the success of Archie meets KISS in 2012 and Archie meets Glee in 2013, the Archie Creative Summit held in March 2014 included a brainstorming session for new crossovers. Godzilla and Friday the 13th were considered, but the Predator received the most support. Artist Fernando Ruiz was at the summit and liked the premise, but did not believe it would actually be made, or that he would be involved if it was.Wright, Brendan (afterword). Archie Comics proposed the crossover to 20th Century Fox, who owns the Predator character, and Dark Horse Comics, who had licensed the character for comic books. Both quickly agreed. Dark Horse approached Alex de Campi to write based on her work on the horror comic book Grindhouse and the humorous comic book My Little Pony: Friends Forever. Dark Horse editor Brendan Wright, who was already editing the regular Predator comic book and had previously coordinated with Archie Comics on Dark Horse's Archie Archives reprints, was chosen as editor. Ruiz was the first and only artist considered to pencil the series, and inker Rich Koslowski was selected based on his work with Ruiz on a Thor parody in Archie #648. The project was originally titled Archie meets Predator, but it was changed to vs. because the people involved in production kept calling it that unintentionally, and to parody the Alien vs. Predator franchise. To prepare for the project, de Campi read over 4000 pages of Archie comic books. She drew inspiration for the story from the 1940s era of the series, when she says Archie Andrews' girlfriends Betty Cooper and Veronica Lodge had \\"more edge\\". Her scripts were subject to notes and tweaks from Archie Comics and Fox, but de Campi described both licensors as \\"extremely mellow, pleasant and easy to work with\\". Fox's primary concern was why the Predator, who is known for choosing challenging prey, would be interested in teenagers, but a suitable explanation was included in the story. She expected some of the notes, such as being told she \\"can't make jokes about child predation in an Archie book\\". Other times, she was surprised when she did not receive notes, such as her use of emojis for the Predator's speech. She was pleased when she got to add depth to Dilton Doiley, a character she feels is often overlooked in regular Archie comics. The choice of whether Archie Andrews would survive the series or not was changed several times during scripting, and a final decision was not made until the last draft of the script. Ruiz experimented with drawing the whole series in a more realistic manner, but from the beginning the plan was to use the traditional Archie design style for the book, which Archie veteran Dan DeCarlo popularized in the classic comics since the 1960s. The editorial team felt this would make the story feel more \\"bizarre and unsettling\\". Although most modern comic art is created using digital tools and scans to accelerate the creation process, the art team for Archie vs. Predator chose to use traditional methods and used FedEx to get the physical copy of each page to the person who would complete the next step in the process. Archie Comics and Dark Horse Comics jointly announced Archie vs. Predator and its creative team at the 2014 New York Comic Con. Soon after, many media outlets carrying the news used a headline indicating the bizarre announcement was not a joke. Wright described it as his \\"most nutso project\\" and was continually surprised by the scale of positive reaction to it. Publication A promotional ashcan comic was released a couple of months before the first issue. It featured eight pages from the first issue and some of Ruiz's character designs, including some of his initial, more lifelike Predator sketches. The four issues were published monthly beginning April 15, 2015, and ending July 22, 2015. Each issue had two variant covers, and the first issue had some additional store-exclusive and convention-exclusive covers.From the Variant Cover Gallery. All of the issues also included a one-page, humorous bonus strip written by de Campi featuring crossovers of other Archie and Dark Horse characters: Sabrina Meets Hellboy (art by Robert Hack), Little Mask and his Pals (art by Art Baltazar), Jughead Meets MIND MGMT: \\"S\\" is for Sleeper (art by Matt Kindt), and Josie and the Pussycats Meet Finder (art by Carla Speed McNeil). A 128-page hardcover collecting the series and bonus content was released November 4, 2015, followed by a 104-page softcover edition on August 21, 2019. Synopsis When Archie and his friends take a spring break trip to Los Perdidos Resort, an alien, trophy-hunting Predator touches down in the nearby jungle. Betty and Veronica get into a fight during a contest and attract the attention of the Predator, who follows them home to Riverdale. While targeting Veronica, the Predator also kills several armed people. The creature's picture is taken by Betty. Kevin Keller's father, a US Military General, identifies it as a teenager from a race of nearly unstoppable alien hunters. The Kellers organize Archie's friends, and Jughead Jones is used as bait to lure the Predator, but the trap fails and the Predator kills most of the ambush party. Some members of the group decide to split up in hopes the Predator will continue to pursue Veronica, allowing them to escape, while Archie, Betty, Jughead and Dilton stay with Veronica. When the Predator attacks again, it kills Dilton and Jughead and critically wounds Archie. Betty and Veronica take refuge at Lodge Manor, where they hook Archie to an experimental healing machine. When the Predator attacks, Archie is killed and Veronica and Betty are critically wounded, which causes the Predator to show regret since it was motivated by a crush on Betty. Veronica recovers to find that Betty has used the healing machine to restore them both to full health and is now using it to transform the Predator into an Archie look-alike. Reception The first issue was the best-selling issue for both publishers in April 2015, and the 74th best selling comic book among other releases that month.By units sold. Sales numbers fell just under 30% through the fourth issue, which was the 102nd best selling issue in July.By units sold. When the hardcover was released in November, it was the 36th best-selling comics collection of the month according to Diamond Comic Distributors.By units sold. The first issue garnered an average review rating of 7.9 out of 10 according to the review aggregator Comic Book Roundup.Based on 42 reviews from critics. Writing for The Guardian, Graeme Virtue said the \\"appealingly strange\\" series fit with Archie Comics' reputation for pushing comics forward and praised it for remaining true to both the Archie and Predator properties. The book's \\"deeply funny dark humor\\" was a selling point for Robin Parrish at Tech Times, and IGN reviewer Jeff Lake described the first issue as \\"pretty darn great\\". The use of the traditional cartoon art style to depict gruesome scenes was described as \\"a visual loss of innocence\\" by Paste magazine. Comic Bastards' Dustin Cabeal called the miniseries \\"a hoot\\". The series won the 2015 Ghastly Award for Best Limited Series.

They travelled around Mirditë and were kidnapped by a famous bandit Mustafa Lita. After their release in Prizren, they travelled to Skopje and went to visit the home of Doda in Upper Reka. Back in Shkodër, they went and visited the lands of tribes Hoti and Gruda. Both traveled together and separately throughout the Albanian lands. During the First World War in 1915-1916, Nopcsa took Doda with him while serving in the Austro-Hungarian army in Kosovo. After the war, they lived mainly in Vienna where Nopcsa published several books and became known not only as an albanologist, but also as a paleontologist and geologist. However, for about 3 years they went on a tour through Europe on a motorcycle, looking for fossils. On April 25, 1933, suffering from depression Nopcsa killed Doda in his sleep and then committed suicide.  Photographic and Literary works Doda is author of the book Albanisches Bauerleben im oberen Rekatal bei Dibra (Makedonien)(Albanian Peasant Life in the Upper Reka Valley near Dibra (Macedonia)), which was completed in Vienna in April 1914 and was published posthumously in Vienna 2007, after being rediscovered within the archives. The publication is accompanied by original photographs taken by Doda during 1907 consisting mainly of village Štirovica and its surroundings, along with two accompanying photographs of Skopje. The book by Doda contains much valuable information about Upper Reka and its culture, customs, language and other facets of life. The book's aim, according to the author was to describe the vanishing lifestyle of the Muslim element in Upper River and to refute claims by Spiridon Gopčević in his book Macedonia and Old Serbia (1889) about Upper Reka Albanians being albanicised Slavs. Robert Elsie stated that the original script, regarded as lost may have been translated into German by Nopcsa (and or with considerable input by him) from Albanian, due to the amount of Albanian vocabulary it contained. Elsie has praised the book for its detailed information on Upper Reka and because it was composed at a time when little Albanian literature had been produced. Elsie contends that the work was the first to employ the Upper Reka Albanian dialect in literature. \\"Das in der Österreichischen Nationalbibliothek aufbewahrte Typoskript, Albanisches Bauernleben im Oberen Rekatal, wurde von seinem damals sechsundzwanzigjährigen Verfasser in Wien im April 1914 fertiggestellt aber nie veröffentlicht. Aus dem Vorwort des Verfassers geht hervor, dass der Text von Nopcsa ins Deutsche übersetzt wurde. Da die deutsche Fassung starke Ähnlichkeiten mit anderen ethnographischen Werken Nopcsas aufweist, kann man davon ausgehen, dass dieser bei der Gestaltung des Manuskriptes seinen Einfluss zur Geltung brachte. Dies wird insbesondere in den vielen in Nopcsas Schrift verfassten Ergänzungen und Korrekturen ersichtlich. Wenn es eine albanischsprachige Urfassung des Werkes gab, so muss sie nun als verschollen gelten. Albanisches Bauernleben im Oberen Rekatal wurde zu einer Zeit geschrieben, als es für die albanische Sprache, und um so mehr für die nun ausgestorbene albanische Mundart von Reka, keine allgemein anerkannte Schreibweise gab. Die in dem Text zahlreich vorkommenden albanischen Worte und Ortsbezeichnungen wurden von Doda und Nopcsa daher in deutscher Umschrift angegeben - und zwar nicht immer auf sehr konsequenter Weise -, und werden hier in gedruckter Form nach einigen Anpassungen wie im Original gelassen. Der des Albanischen mächtigen Leser dürfte mit der Umschrift keine allzu große Schwierigkeiten haben. Die vorliegende Studie enthält eine Fülle von Angaben und Informationen aus den verschiedensten Bereichen und wird daher in vielen Fachgebieten Interesse wecken und Verwendung finden. Darüber hinaus dürfte sie die frühste in deutscher Sprache von einem Albaner verfasste Studie zur Ethnographie sein. Allein aus diesem Grund ist es uns eine besondere Freude, das Werk Albanisches Bauernleben im oberen Rekatal nach so vielen Jahren dem Publikum vorstellen zu dürfen. [Preserved in the Austrian National Library the typescript, Albanian peasant life in the Upper Reka, was created by his then twenty-six year old writer in Vienna in April 1914 completed, but never released. From the preface of the author shows that the text of Nopcsa was translated into German. Since the German version has strong similarities with other ethnographic works of Nopcsa, one can assume that this brought his advantageous influence in shaping the manuscript. This is particularly evident in the many font additions and corrections written in by Nopcsa. If there was an Albanian-language original version of the work, it must now be regarded as lost. Albanian peasant life in Upper Reka was written at a time when there was no generally accepted notation for the Albanian language, and more so for the now extinct dialect of Albanian Reka. In the text the numerous occurring Albanian words and place names were therefore given by Doda and Nopcsa in German transliteration – not always in a very consistent manner – calmly, and be here in printed form after some adjustments to the original. The majority of Albanian readers should not have too much difficulty with the inscription. The present study contains a wealth of data and information from different sectors and will therefore arouse interest in many fields and can be used. The present study contains a wealth of data and information from different areas and will therefore arouse interest in many fields and can be used. Moreover, it is likely to be the earliest ethnography in German by an Albanian who wrote the study. For this reason alone it is to be allowed special treatment, the work Albanian peasant life in the upper Reka, after so many years by the audience.]\\" Other scholars like Andrea Pieroni describe the work as a “very detailed ethnographic account” that includes “important notes concerning local food and medicinal plant uses” about research of the Upper Reka region.

Parallel to the castle, there is a fortified renaissance house, where there is the Stafileo's family crest, engraved with a bunch of grapes. The grapes are a visual translation of the Štafileo name, which means bunch of grapes in Greek. The crest symbolizes wine making, and the future. There is also an inscription in Latin above the castle gate, which states the original purpose behind the Castle's construction. The southern residential wing of the house has a water gate that still exists today. Origin of the name Castle Rotondo is named after the noble family, 'Rotondo' that resided in it for over 400 years. Prior to this, it was 'Castle Štafileo'. History The first owner, and builder, Stefano Štafileo arrived from Crete, Greece, and married a woman from Trogir.

Her most important finding are the Children of Llullaillaco, considered the best preserved mummies in the world by the Guinness World Records. She is also the first woman worldwide to specialize in high-altitude archaeology, studying Inca ceremonial centers on the summits of Andean peaks above 6000 meters. She is a pioneer in the anthropological study of sacred mountains around the world, and in the emerging field of glacial archaeology. She is a scientific researcher in the National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET) of Argentina, founder and director pro bono of the Institute of High Mountain Research and a professor of Inca Archaeology at the Catholic University of Salta (UCASAL).. Ceruti is the first woman to specialize in the field of high-altitude archaeology. As an archaeologist, she has excavated Inca Empire ceremonial centers on the summits of the Andes. As an anthropologist, she has been studying hundreds of sacred mountains in diverse parts of the world, looking at their role in religion, mythology, folklore, identity and tourism. She has done more than 80 field surveys, many with National Geographic teams in Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru. Much of her research takes place on sites that have never been explored before. She has conducted research on sacred mountains and the world´s religions in the Nepal Himalayas, India, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, Hawai, Egypt, Morocco, Turkey, Greece, Croacia, Norway, Italy, France, Spain, Ireland, Scotland, England, Greenland, Canada, Alaska, United States, Mexico, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Brazil, Peru and Chile. Her work has significant impact in many areas of research.  Education  Born in the city of Buenos Aires on 11 January 1973, Constanza Ceruti studied in the University of Buenos Aires, graduating with the university's Gold Medal and a degree in anthropology in 1996. In October 2001 she earned her doctorate cum laude at the National University of Cuyo, the first person to specialize in high altitude archeology.  Career  Ceruti is a Professor of Incan Archaeology at the Catholic University of Salta (UCASAL),, as well as the founder and ad-honorem director of the Institute of High Mountain Investigations of the Catholic University of Salta. She is also a researcher of the National Council for Scientific Research in Argentina (CONICET)., and member of the National Academy of Sciences of Buenos Aires (ANCBA),, the Argentina Society of Anthropology (Sociedad Argentina de Antropologia), the Association of Professional Archaeologists of Argentina (Colegio de Graduados de Antropología), the Society for American Archaeology, The Explorers Club in New York, and the Society of Woman Geographers. She has climbed more than a hundred mountains reaching above during her research. Her most important ascents include the Aconcagua at in 1996 and 1997, the Pissis volcano at , the Llullaillaco volcano in 1999, the Cerro Meléndez at in 1998 the snow-capped Cachi in 1996 and 1997 and Quehuar in 1996 and 1999. She has published 25 books, four of them on High Mountain archeology in the Andes, and more than 100 scientific papers.  Research  The work Ceruti does at high altitudes is exceptionally dangerous. In 1998 Ceruti performed an archaeological excavation at an altitude of more than with Johan Reinhard on the higher slopes of the active volcano Misti near Arequipa, Peru. The remains of six human sacrifices older than 500 years of antiquity were examined. In 1999 Ceruti co-lead four archaeological expeditions with Johan Reinhard in the Andes mountains. The first involved an ascent of Nevado Quehuar at . There investigators recovered the remains of a mummified child, whose gravesite had been blasted open with dynamite and looted of ceremonial objects by treasure hunters. Researchers carefully salvaged the pieces of the body, which had been left scattered on the mountaintop. Children of Llullaillaco Archeological site at the top of Llullaillaco One of the Children of Llullaillaco A few weeks later Ceruti, Reinhard, and a team from National Geographic ascended the Llullaillaco volcano in the Argentine province of Salta. Llullaillaco is the highest archaeological site in the world at . During an extended high-altitude excavation period, they found and studied the intact mummies of three Incan children, a boy and two girls. The bodies were accompanied by dozens of sumptuous objects of typical Inca style, including ceramic vessels, wooden cups, woven bags, spondylus shells, sandals, moccasins, clothing, jewelry, and female figurine miniatures. These mummies are considered some of the better preserved mummies of the world. The Museum of High Mountain Archeology of Salta (MAAM) has been built to provide a home for them. For six years, Ceruti and others at UCASAL scientifically studied the mummified bodies of the three Inca children of Llullaillaco in an international collaboration. They were able to determine the general lifestyle, ages, and causes of death of the children. The youngest, a girl, died at age six of pulmonary edema as a result of the high altitude. After her death, her mummy was struck by lightning. The second youngest, a boy, died at age seven due to exposure to cold. The oldest, a fifteen-year-old girl, died also died of exposure. DNA analysis showed that they were not related. Ceruti's notes from the original sites, painstakingly compiled under extreme conditions, have enabled researchers to better understand the ceremonial and political implications of the capacocha ritual. The children were in good health before their deaths, and had not suffered from malnutrition, suggested they were from high-status families. Analysis of their hair revealed that all three had eaten an enriched corn-based diet during their last year of life, including coca leaves, which can be eaten to counteract high-altitude sickness. Their clothing and artifacts indicate that they came originally from Cuzco, Peru, thousands of miles away, requiring a journey of months to reach the high Andes where they died. Pucará de Tilcara After receiving her doctorate in 2001, Ceruti lived for five years in an adobe house near Pucará de Tilcara, Pucará de Tilcara is a fortification built around the twelfth century A.D. by ancestors of the Omaguaca people. By the fourteenth century, it was an important administrative, military and religious center. The area was conquered by the Incas, and a few decades later by the Spanish, who arrived in 1536. People continue to make pilgrimages from the village to nearby mountain shrines. Living there enabled Ceruti to become deeply aware of village life and its connections to pre-Incan and Incan traditions. Bibliography=Published books * 2019, Montañas Sagradas de Noruega.

From 1950 to his retirement in 1965 he was professor at the Hochschule für Musik Freiburg.  Life and work  Ueter was born in Münster, where he studied Christian music at the Bischöfliche Kirchenmusikschule (Episcopal Church Music School) from 1915 to 1918. During these years he was also organist at different churches in Münster. He worked as a teacher for Gregorian musicology, music theory and violin at the Bischöfliche Kirchenmusikschule after the completion of his studies, but attended the composition class of Fritz Volbach at the University of Münster further on. In the year 1921 Carl Ueter was accepted as a student of the composition master class of Franz Schreker at the Hochschule für Musik in Berlin and among his fellow students were Alois Haba, Berthold Goldschmidt, Max Brand and Jerzy Fitelberg. Further studies included Instrumental Music with Emil Nikolaus von Reznicek as well as courses with Max Seiffert and Curt Sachs. In 1923 after his studies Carl Ueter took the position of a lecturer at the Musikhochschule Mannheim and became later in the same year répétiteur at the Stadttheater Münster. Still in 1923 the music director of the Stadttheater Münster, Ewald Lindemann, followed an appointment as a music director at the Stadttheater Freiburg im Breisgau and took Carl Ueter with him. Until the outbreak of World War I in 1939 Carl Ueter took the position of the 1. Kapellmeister at the Städtische Bühnen Freiburg. Between 1940 and 1944 Carl Ueter fulfilled military service and got into US war captivity. Until 1945 he was arrested at the prisoner-of-war camp at Bad Aibling. In 1946 the Hochschule für Musik Freiburg was founded and Carl Ueter took a position as a lecturer there from the very beginning. In 1950 he was appointed professor and until his retirement in 1965 he held masterclasses in conducting,Susanne Farwick: Studien zur zeitgenössischen Musik für Flöte solo in der zweiten Hälfte des 20.

History Already before the electrified S-Bahn came about, there was a trial for the electrified commuter trains running from Potsdamer Wannseebahnhof to Zehlendorf in 1902 and from Potsdamer Ringbahnhof to Lichterfelde Ost from 1903. Also in 1903, the AEG company ran an overhead wire test track from Niederschöneweide to Spindlersfeld. Electrification has also came about to the solutions to increase capacity along the Hamburg-Altonaer Stadt- und Vorortbahn. World War I interrupted the electrification plans from 1914 to 1918, which, however, were revived just afterwards. In 1920 the Prussian state railways ordered six test trains, which were first pulled by steam locomotives until electrification commenced in 1923. One year later, on 8 August 1924, the first section from Stettiner Vorortbahnhof to Bernau was inaugurated; the two other northern railway lines to Oranienburg and Velten (Kremmen Railway) followed until 1927. To service all electrified connections, Deutsche Reichsbahn purchased 34 power cars and 51 trailers in total. In everyday operation, however, the engines soon proved to be too weak and already in 1925 upgraded versions (the later DR Class ET 168 and ET 165) were ordered in large numbers. Morevover, the ET 169 railcars were too large to pass the Berlin Nord-Süd Tunnel opened in 1936, and had to be deployed on the Ringbahn line. Plans for a withdrawal from service were not carried out due to the wagon shortage during World War II. After the war, the East German Deutsche Reichsbahn had planned to use modernized ET 169 trains on branch lines from Wannsee to Stahnsdorf and from Zehlendorf to Düppel, or as additional trains on the northern Ringbahn and on the Siemensbahn branch from Jungfernheide. But however when the Berlin S-Bahn was divided due to the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, they were all again allocated to the Oranienburg, Bernau and Velten stretches of the line. The trainsets were phased out from 1962 and most trains were withdrawn in 1969. Some components were re-used for the rolling stock of the East Berlin U-Bahn line E.

It bears the words \\"Dear friends and gentle hearts\\" in his handwriting. It may have been an idea for a song. The Stephen Foster Collection and archives are the largest collection of primary source materials on the life and work of composer Stephen Foster. The collection consists of documents and other items of historical interest related to the life and work of Stephen Foster. It resides in the Stephen Foster Memorial at the University of Pittsburgh. Josiah K. Lilly donated an almost complete set of first edition music. The memorial houses sketchbooks and other memorabilia The process of assembling the collection was methodical, well-organized and funded by various non-governmental and governmental sources. The cost of maintaining the collection is partially funded by the University of Pittsburgh.  Purpose  Stephen Foster, one of the most influential composers in American history, never composed an autobiography or made any autobiographical statements. Following his death in 1864, his brother Morrison Foster, apparently ashamed by Stephen's association with abolitionists, destroyed nearly all manuscript material about him, preserving only a few dozen letters, none of which contain any biographical information, and some of his music manuscripts. Morrison also destroyed references to Stephen's life from his own letters, and published a biography of Stephen which is regarded as unreliable and nearly useless for historical purposes. 50 years after Stephen's death, historians felt a need to gather the scattered material by and about him in a single place, and thus created the Stephen Foster Collection.  History The Stephen Foster archives are housed in the Stephen Foster Memorial which was designed by architect Charles Klauder. Its construction reflects the same style as the Cathedral of Learning, and Heinz Chapel on the University of Pittsburgh's campus. The W.F. Trimble & Son's Company was contracted to help erect the building on March 2, 1935. It consists of of Indiana limestone, 400 tons (360,000 kg) of steel, and of concrete. In 1930, Josiah Kirby Lilly began collecting all forms of Foster's music, letters, furniture, original manuscripts and instruments. He kept his collection in his own stone cottage in Indianapolis. He called it Foster Hall. Then in 1932 Josiah Kirby Lilly pledged more than 10,000 Foster items to form the initial archive collection. Other efforts began the necessary fund-raising. Lily and his son covered almost half of the cost at that time amounting to $550,000. A portion of the collection has now been digitized and can be accessed through the University of Pittsburgh's University Library System.  Methodology  Establishing the scope of Stephen Foster music and discography was conducted by Dr. Deane Root, the curator of the Stephen C. Foster Memorial at the University of Pittsburgh. He initiated the revision of the standard reference work on Stephen Foster music - \\"Songs and Compositions and Arrangements by Stephen Collins Foster 1826-1864\\" published in 1933. The new reference work, published with the Smithsonian Institution Press was assisted by the Rodgers and Hammerstein Archive of the New York Public Library at Lincoln Center, New York City. At the time of the drafting of the new discography, other archives were reviewed. These were Stanford University, Stanford, CA; Yale University, New Haven, CT; Library of Congress, Washington, DC; Rodgers and Hammerstein Archive, Lincoln Center, New York City; and Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, and the Library of Congress, Music Division. Creating the new discography was aided by collectors throughout the United States and in foreign countries. These loaned their own catalogs, listed out specific records in their collections, and supplied other known listings. The examination of private, commercial auction lists and other retail mail offerings were also used to identify Foster pieces for purchase and to compare to the other listings. In updating the 1933 discography, Root employed other materials. Slips came with the early-unmarked cylinders, and were often hand-written. These written descriptions were not attached to the cylinders themselves. This was not the case for labels pressed on a disc recordings which were badly deteriorated. One the collections notable recordings was a brown Wax Cylinder (c.1895) from Wheeling, WV. This recording by the vocalist Edward M. Favor is one of the earliest recordings in the archives. Its volume is faint and was intended to be used with a tube and earphone type machine. Historians assume that not more than 50 pieces were made of this cylinder. Research into creating a new, authoritative and complete discography included the review of marketing materials of the Edison Amberol record supplements were published every month from 1906 to the 1920s by the Edison Record sales staff in Orange, NJ, The purpose of the promotional materials was to keep the public and recording retailers up to date on the newest Edison releases. Edison's company wanted to appeal to as wide an audience as possible. His marketing materials were helpful in expanding the discography and identified marches by Sousa, a recitation by Davenport), violin solos by Spaulding, orchestra selections such as Herbert's Operetta Little Nemo, and a ballad by tenor Will Oakland (Just Before the Battle Mother). Though today recording companies are generally cooperative, creating a comprehensive discography was hampered by the usual business practices of controlling costs and the lack of financial incentives in the preservation of commercial record companies. At the time that a recording was made, it was not viewed as \\"a creation of recorded history\\", and files were maintained for \\"commercial control\\". Recording companies have not been found to support research into their own history in house or by outside researchers. For example, Columbia Records, established in the 1890s has little information on the thousands of cylinder recordings it sold.  Discography  The Stephen Foster archives are housed in the Stephen Foster Memorial on the campus of the University of Pittsburgh, also the location of the Center For American Music (Pittsburgh). The contents were collected by various organizations and individuals who conducted their efforts between 1896 and 1925. The collection includes the acoustic recordings made in US during these years and are cataloged in a discography. This list describes the over 450 published and 32 unpublished acoustic recordings. In addition to the recording themselves, the collection documents biographical details along with accompanying photographs of the musicians, groups, vocalists and music publishers who performed or sold Foster's music. The recordings were transferred from original cylinders and record albumns. The cylinders are of various speed, speeds and manufacture and origin. They are made of both wax and celluloid.

This gene encodes a prostaglandin transporter. As non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis this helps to explain the known similarity in the histological findings between these conditions. The identification of this mutation suggests that prostaglandin replacement may be helpful but this will need to be tested in a clinical trail.

Ellis, Luďa Klusáková; (2007) Imagining Frontiers, Contesting Identities p. 145; Pisa University Press Karl Kaser; (2012) Household and Family in the Balkans: Two Decades of Historical Family Research at University of Graz p. 117-119; LIT Verlag, From the middle decades of the 17th century the amalgamation of the process of sedentarization of the Orthodox Vlachs and their gradual fusion with Serbian rural population reached a high level and was officially recognized by the Ottoman authorities. Origins Following the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans, the Vlachs, being both Orthodox and Catholic, and still a largely nomadic and semi-nomadic pastoral non-Slavic-speaking people, played a dual role in the relations with the new Ottoman ruler. Although a few of the Orthodox Vlachs and part of the Catholic Vlachs from Duklja and Bosnia fled before the invading Ottoman armies, to Christian lands in the West (i.e. Croatia and abroad); the remaining of them, both Orthodox in the central Balkans and Catholics in Herzegovina and Duklja, welcomed with joy the new situation created, since the conquerors vouchsafed to them vast ranges for themselves and their cattle and promised to improve their social position. It thus propitiated special arrangements between the Turks and the Vlachs, who in turn, while preserving their religion (excepting some, largely high-ranking members of society, who converted to Islam in order to secure for themselves and their families special privileges and prominent administrative positions from the Ottoman authorities), placed themselves in the Sultan's service; all this made possible that the Vlachs would come to form a considerably privileged class within the Millet system in the Ottoman Empire, compared to the class of the Reaya, for more than a century. In addition, with the beginning of Ottoman rule, within this social class also came to be included other Vlach-like (pastoral semi-nomad) populations, such as cattle-breeding Orthodox Serbs;. Serbs in Ottoman Hungary in great numbers served as Martolos, which were Christian origin members largely recruited from the Vlach and Vlach like population. Service During the early history of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans, there was Vlach people members of military class living in Serbia and Macedonia which had the same rights as Muslims. They might have been the descendants of Christians but their origin is not entirely clear. Due to their experience in carrying goods and the skill and speed with which they crossed the mountain regions; the Turks began to take advantage of it by employing them as auxiliary troops (voynuk), thus entrusting to them the conveyance of military supplies, the carrying out of spying operations and quick looting- sorching raids in enemy Christian territory, and the patrol of mountain gorges and boundaries in general. In addition, they always accompanied the Ottoman armies in their expeditions throughout the Balkans, up to the North-West, in whole communities; being intended for populating the newly conquered territories as border military colonies, called katun or džemaat (which were composed of about 20 to 50 houses); at the head of which there was a katunar or primikur (\\"headman\\"). They also formed important as well as highly numbered Christian military garrisons (martolos) attached to the Ottoman army, in the newly conquered towns. In exchange for their regular duties, they were granted privileges which were denied to all other Zimmîs by the Šerijat or Islamic Law; for example, as they served regularly as Ottoman auxiliary troops, they were allowed to bear arms and to ride horses. This rewarding privileges were also extended to the economic sphere; these communities were largely exempted of paying any tax but only that of an annual rent of one gold 'ducat' or 'florin' to pay by each one of their households, hence coming to be called as \\"Florin\\" or \\"Ducat Vlachs\\" (Ottoman Turkish: Filurîci Eflakân). At the same time, great Turkish and Slavic Muslim landholding military nobles (Sipahi and Timarli) often brought with them significant quantities of these Vlachs (sometimes Serbs as well), in order that they farmed their lands. Decline However, during the course of time, with centralisation and changes to state structure, the economic system and military organisation occurring, many of the services that the Vlachs used to provide for the Ottomans became superfluous. As a result, the 1520s saw the beginning of Vlach sedentarisation and a reduction of their privileges. By the end of the 16th century, these privileges resulted in the majority of Vlachs’ social standing being equalled to that of the filurîci, and later with ordinary reaya peasants. Lastly, the sound Ottoman defeat at Sisak in 1593 triggered the beginning of loss of faith by these Vlachs, (both genuine Vlachs and Serbs) in those who until then had been their masters, and propitiated the passing of the Vlachs and the Serbs over to the Habsburg side (see Uprising in Banat).Ferdo Šišić: Povijest Hrvata; pregled povijesti hrvatskog naroda 600 – 1918, p. 345, Zagreb Tax The Rüsûm-i Eflakiye was a tax on Vlachs in the Ottoman Empire. Vlachs in the Balkans were granted tax concessions under Byzantine and Serb rulers in return for military service; and this continued under Ottoman rule. Instead of some of the customary taxes, they paid a special \\"Vlach tax\\", Rüsûm-i Eflakiye: One sheep and one lamb from each household on St. Georges Day each year. Because Vlachs were taxed differently, they were listed differently in defters.

It seeks to regulate all clinical establishments in India. The Act requires all clinical establishments to register themselves and provides a set of standard treatment guidelines for common diseases and conditions. The state governments must adopt the law by passing a resolution in the legislative assemblies. As of March 2018, the following states have adopted it: Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Sikkim, Bihar, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Jharkhand, Assam, Haryana. However, not all of these states have made any clear provisions to implement the Act. Overview The Act cannot be directly applied to all states of India. The states have the choice of passing a resolution to adopt the bill or passing a similar bill. The Act however directly applies to the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Mizoram, and Sikkim, as they had passed resolutions allowing such laws in their states. The aim of the Act is to register all clinical establishments in India to make it easier to regulate them and implement standard practices. With the exception of the establishments under the military forces, all public and private establishments, including AYUSH establishments, are required to register. According to Chapter I Clause 2 (c), a clinical establishment may be a hospital, maternity home, nursing home, dispensary, clinic, sanatorium or any other institution that offer services for diagnosis, care or treatment of patients. The Chapter II details the formation of a National Council. The Chapter III details the formation of State and Union Territory Councils. It also requires formation of district registering authorities. The Chapter IV details the registration procedure. A provisional registration shall be valid for 1 year and must be renewed. An establishment may apply for a permanent registration. The registration certificate must be prominently displayed. The Chapter V details the creation of state and national level Register of Medical Establishment in digital form. The Chapter VI details various offences and penalties. For example, running an unregistered establishment carries a fine up to on the first offence. A person knowingly working in an unregistered establishment will be fined up to . There is also a fine of up to for obstructing investigations, withholding information or giving false information. In case of violation by a corporate body, the management shall be held responsible.

It is given by the formula: : Fig. 1: Column effective length factors for Euler's critical load. In practical design, it is recommended to increase the factors as shown above.P_{cr} = \\\\frac{\\\\pi^2 EI}{(KL)^2} where :P_{cr}, Euler's critical load (longitudinal compression load on column), :E, Young's modulus of the column material, :I, minimum area moment of inertia of the cross section of the column, :L, unsupported length of column, :K, column effective length factor This formula was derived in 1757 by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler. The column will remain straight for loads less than the critical load. The critical load is the greatest load that will not cause lateral deflection (buckling). For loads greater than the critical load, the column will deflect laterally. The critical load puts the column in a state of unstable equilibrium. A load beyond the critical load causes the column to fail by buckling. As the load is increased beyond the critical load the lateral deflections increase, until it may fail in other modes such as yielding of the material. Loading of columns beyond the critical load are not addressed in this article. Around 1900, J. B. Johnson showed that at low slenderness ratios an alternative formula should be used.  Assumptions of the model  Fig. 2: Critical stress vs slenderness ratio for steel, for E = 200GPa, yield strength = 240MPa. The following assumptions are made while deriving Euler's formula: # The material of the column is homogeneous and isotropic. # The compressive load on the column is axial only. # The column is free from initial stress. # The weight of the column is neglected. # The column is initially straight (no eccentricity of the axial load). # Pin joints are friction-less (no moment constraint) and fixed ends are rigid (no rotation deflection). # The cross- section of the column is uniform throughout its length. # The direct stress is very small as compared to the bending stress (the material is compressed only within the elastic range of strains). # The length of the column is very large as compared to the cross-sectional dimensions of the column. # The column fails only by buckling. This is true if the compressive stress in the column does not exceed the yield strength \\\\sigma_y (see figure 2): #: \\\\sigma = \\\\frac{P_{cr}}{A} = \\\\frac{\\\\pi^2E}{(L_e/r)^2} < \\\\sigma_y For slender columns, critical stress is usually lower than yield stress, and in the elastic range. In contrast, a stocky column would have a critical buckling stress higher than the yield, i.e. it yields in shortening prior the virtual elastic buckling onset. Where: : \\\\frac{L_e}{r}, slenderness ratio, : L_e = KL, the effective length, : r = \\\\sqrt{\\\\operatorname{I} \\\\over \\\\operatorname{A}}, radius of gyration, : I, area moment of inertia, : A, area cross section.  Mathematical derivation: Pin ended column  The following model applies to columns simply supported at each end (K = 1). Firstly, we will put attention to the fact there are no reactions in the hinged ends, so we also have no shear force in any cross-section of the column. The reason for no reactions can be obtained from symmetry (so the reactions should be in the same direction) and from moment equilibrium (so the reactions should be in opposite directions). Using the free body diagram in the right side of figure 3, and making a summation of moments about point x: : \\\\Sigma M = 0 \\\\Rightarrow M(x) + Pw = 0 where w is the lateral deflection. According to Euler–Bernoulli beam theory, the deflection of a beam is related with its bending moment by: : M = -EI\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}^2w}{\\\\mathrm{d}x^2}, Fig. 3: Pin ended column under the effect of Buckling load so: : EI\\\\frac{d^2w}{dx^2} + Pw = 0 Let \\\\lambda^2 = \\\\frac{P}{EI}, so: : \\\\frac{d^2w}{dx^2} + \\\\lambda^2 w = 0 We get a classical homogeneous second-order ordinary differential equation. The general solutions of this equation is: w(x) = A \\\\cos(\\\\lambda x) + B \\\\sin(\\\\lambda x), where A and B are constants to be determined by boundary conditions, which are: * Left end pinned \\\\rightarrow w(0) = 0 \\\\rightarrow A = 0 * Right end pinned \\\\rightarrow w(l) = 0 \\\\rightarrow B \\\\sin(\\\\lambda l) = 0 Fig. 4: First three modes of buckling loads If B = 0, no bending moment exists and we get the trivial solution of w(x) = 0. However, from the other solution \\\\sin(\\\\lambda l) = 0 we get \\\\lambda_n l = n\\\\pi, for n = 0, 1 , 2, \\\\ldots Together with \\\\lambda^2 = \\\\frac{P}{EI} as defined before, the various critical loads are: : P_{n} = \\\\frac{n^2 \\\\pi^2 EI}{l^2} , for n = 0, 1, 2, \\\\ldots and depending upon the value of n , different buckling modes are produced as shown in figure 4. The load and mode for n=0 is the nonbuckled mode. Theoretically, any buckling mode is possible, but in the case of a slowly applied load only the first modal shape is likely to be produced. The critical load of Euler for a pin ended column is therefore: : P_{cr} = \\\\frac{\\\\pi^2 EI}{l^2} and the obtained shape of the buckled column in the first mode is: : w(x) = B \\\\sin \\\\left({\\\\pi \\\\over l} x\\\\right) .  Mathematical derivation: General approach  Fig. 5: forces and moments acting on a column. The differential equation of the axis of a beam is: : \\\\frac{d^4 w}{dx^4} + \\\\frac{P}{EI}\\\\frac{d^2 w}{dx^2} = \\\\frac{q}{EI} For a column with axial load only, the lateral load q(x) vanishes and substituting \\\\lambda^2 = \\\\frac{P}{EI}, we get: : \\\\frac{d^4 w}{dx^4} + \\\\lambda^2\\\\frac{d^2 w}{dx^2} = 0 This is a homogeneous fourth-order differential equation and its general solution is : w(x) = A\\\\sin(\\\\lambda x) + B\\\\cos(\\\\lambda x) + Cx + D The four constants A, B, C, D are determined by the boundary conditions (end constraints) on w(x) , at each end. There are three cases: # Pinned end: #: w = 0 and M = 0 \\\\rightarrow {d^2w \\\\over dx^2} = 0 # Fixed end: #: w = 0 and {dw \\\\over dx} = 0 # Free end: #: M = 0 \\\\rightarrow {d^2w \\\\over dx^2} = 0 and V = 0 \\\\rightarrow {d^3w \\\\over dx^3} + \\\\lambda^2{dw \\\\over dx} = 0 For each combination of these boundary conditions, an eigenvalue problem is obtained. Solving those, we get the values of Euler's critical load for each one of the cases presented in Figure 1.

The film stars John Karna, Katie Findlay, Craig Roberts, Carlson Young, Adam Riegler, and Alan Tudyk. It was produced by Karen Lunder and Aaron Ryder, with music by Nick Urata, cinematography by Jimmy Lindsey and editing by Robert Nassau. The film is Beers' directorial debut. Plot Rob Crabbe is a regular, awkward high school student. On a particular day, Rob has a college-entrance interview that could change his life. As Rob wakes up from a wet dream, his mother walks into his room and asks Rob to clean his linens after she sees them stained obviously with semen. The interview is for admittance to Georgetown University (the alma mater of Rob's parents) and during the interview Jack Roth (the interviewer) bursts into tears because his wife recently died. A number of events, like Rob's crotch being hit by another student with a water pistol and a minor bicycle/auto incident, occur to further mess up Rob's day. An attractive classmate, Angela, gives Rob the impression that she wants to sleep with him. He visits Angela, the two kiss, and when Angela puts her hand in Rob's pants, he ejaculates prematurely and wakes up in his room, just at the same moment that his mother walks in on him. The day begins again. At first, Rob believes it all to be a dream, but after experiencing the same day several times, ending with his ejaculation, he realizes that it's not a dream. Rob then attempts to make the day different. He drives a golf cart through the school, smokes pot with his friend Gabrielle in the school bus, touches a teacher's breasts and tries to damage the water pistol, but none of it results in him escaping the time loop. Rob eventually realizes that he's in love with Gabrielle and goes to her place to confess his feelings. Gabrielle returns his affection and the two decide to have sex. Again, Rob has a premature ejaculation, but this time he does not wake up in his room, but continues to be with Gabrielle. He realizes that he has finally broken the time loop.

It is approximately long and flows through West Abington Township in Lackawanna County and Clinton Township in Wyoming County. The stream has no named tributaries, but it does have ten unnamed tributaries. There are also a number of wetlands in the watershed of the stream. The stream is classified as a Coldwater Fishery. Its watershed occupies portions of three municipalities in Wyoming County and five in Lackawanna County. Course Trout Brook Trout Brook begins in a pond or small lake in West Abington Township, to the northeast of Wilbur Hill. It flows northwest for a short distance before turning north for several tenths of a mile, passing through one pond or small lake and entering another, where it receives an unnamed tributary from the right. The stream then turns west-northwest for a short distance before turning north-northwest and passing through two more lakes and receiving an unnamed tributary from the left and two more from the right. The stream then turns northwest for several tenths of a mile before exiting West Abington Township and Lackawanna County. Upon exiting Lackawanna County, Trout Brook enters Clinton Township, Wyoming County. It heads west-northwest for several tenths of a mile, receiving two unnamed tributaries from the left and one from the right, and then turns southwest. After a few tenths of a mile, it turns west-northwest for several tenths of a mile, receiving one unnamed tributary from the left and one from the right. The stream then turns west-southwest for several tenths of a mile before receiving a final unnamed tributary from the left. It then turns northwest for several tenths of a mile before reaching its confluence with South Branch Tunkhannock Creek. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Trout Brook is above sea level. The elevation of the stream's source is between above sea level. Watershed and biology Trout Brook is located entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Factoryville. The watershed of the stream is located mainly in Clinton Township, Wyoming County; Overfield Township, Wyoming County; and West Abington Township, Lackawanna County. Smaller areas of the watershed are in Factoryville, Wyoming County; La Plume Township, Lackawanna County; Dalton, Lackawanna County; and Glenburn Township, Lackawanna County.

He covered the entertainment industry for both Variety (1953–1960, 1979–1992) and The Hollywood Reporter (1992–2008) during a career which spanned seven decades. Hollinger helped to developed a new system for tracking the overseas box office while working for Variety's London bureau. He later served as the international editor at The Hollywood Reporter from 1992 until 2008, when he retired at the age of 90. Hollinger was considered an expert on the international box office and the sale independent productions directly to foreign film distributors. Biography=Early life Hollinger was born Herman Hollinger in The Bronx, New York City, on September 3, 1918. He attended Townsend Harris High School in Queens, New York. He worked as a messenger and copy boy in the classified ad department at the New York Times on Saturdays from 1932 to 1935 as a high school student. During college, Hollinger landed an internship at CBS Radio, which included a position assisting CBS' coverage of the 1940 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia. Hollinger graduated from City College of New York and received a master's degree from the Columbia School of Journalism. Career He served in the Armed Forces Radio from 1942 to 1945 during World War II. Following the end of the war, Hollinger wrote for a weekly newspaper in suburban Philadelphia and worked as a sports reporter for the now defunct New York Morning Telegraph. Hollinger departed The Morning Telegraph to take a job as a publicist at Warner Bros.. He next joined Variety, the weekly entertainment trade magazine, from 1953 to 1960. While working under Variety's London bureau chief Don Grove, Hollinger co-developed a new system for tracking the overseas box office, which had been difficult to follow at the time. Hollinger then returned to public relations as a publicity director for Paramount Pictures' International Telemeter Company, an experimental pay television operation, which existed during the 1950s and 1960s. He was later promoted, first to Paramount's European production publicity director, based in London, and then to Paramount's \\"ad-pub\\", or Vice President of Marketing. He worked on some of Paramount's best known productions of the era, including the 1970 film, Love Story. During the early 1970s, Hollinger left Paramount Pictures following a change in the studio's leadership. He worked in corporate public relations, beginning in 1972. His clients included the National Basketball Players Association and Sagittarius Productions, owned by Edgar Bronfman, Sr., the head of Seagram at the time. In Midtown Manhattan in the late 1970s, Hollinger had a chance encounter with Syd Silverman, his former boss at Variety during the 1950s, and Robert Hawkins, another executive at Variety. That unintended meeting with Silverman and Hawkins led to Hollinger rejoining the staff of Variety in 1979 as an associate editor focused on international issues within the entertainment industry. At the time of Hollinger's hiring, Variety, based in New York City, and Daily Variety, based in Hollywood, essentially operated as distinct, separate media entities. The decision to hire Hollinger in 1979 marked \\"the first time in many years that weekly Variety will have its own editorial presence in the film capital,\\" according to a story later published at the time. Hollinger broke the story in 1980 that the jury at the Cannes Film Festival, chaired that year by Kirk Douglas, had been surprised that a French film, My American Uncle, had been awarded the Grand Prix by Cannes' organizers, despite the fact that the jury had rejected the film as the winner. Hollinger also reported on the widespread dissatisfaction with the Cannes Film Festival and MIFED, a now defunct film market held annually in Milan. International film merchants, based in Los Angeles, had to attend Cannes and MIFED, to sell their films to overseas markets during the 1970s and early 1980s. At the time, there were no comparable venues to sell U.S. films to the world markets held in the United States. His reports on the foreign sales monopolies held by Cannes and MIFED led to the establishment of the American Film Market (AFM) in 1981. Hollinger's work has been credited with the need an American alternative to Cannes and MIFED. Robert Meyers, a founding member and first chairman of the American Film Market, recalled asking other film executives, \\"Why are we all going to Cannes just to sell the American independent film, and why not right here in the U.S.?\\", after reading a series of Hollinger's stories in Variety. The American Film Market, one of the film industry's leading marketplaces, is now held annually in Santa Monica, California. In 1992, Hollinger left Variety, to become the international editor of 'The Hollywood Reporter'. Hollinger served as The Hollywood Reporter's international editor from 1992 until 2008, when he retired at the age of 90. Hy Hollinger died at Olympia Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, on October 7, 2015, at the age of 97. Hollinger's wife of 61 years, actress Gina Collens, died on May 31, 2014, at the age of 90. He was survived by their daughter, Alicia Hollinger (born May 28, 1959), an artist and illustrator.

The episode was written by Heather Bellson and directed by Jeffrey F. January. This episode focuses on Abraham, Sasha and Daryl's plotlines after the events of \\"Thank You\\". It marks the first appearance of the characters Dwight and his wife Sherry from the comic books, who are played by Austin Amelio and Christine Evangelista, respectively.http://screencrush.com/walking-dead-season-6-dwight-confirmed/ Plot Daryl (Norman Reedus), Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green) and Abraham (Michael Cudlitz), leading the parade of walkers away from Alexandria, reach the pre-determined point where they believe the walkers will continue away from the town, and turn to head back. They are ambushed by several men in cars, and Daryl is separated from Sasha and Abraham. Daryl evades the attackers but crashes his motorcycle in a forest. He walks through a burned- out path before coming upon a pair of sisters Tina (Liz E. Morgan) and Sherry (Christine Evangelista). The two feign surrendering to Daryl, allowing Dwight (Austin Amelio), hiding nearby, to knock him out and take his weapons. Kept under gunpoint, Daryl is forced to travel with them as they look for \\"Patty\\". Dwight explains they were trying to flee a community that they had joined, but were forced to \\"kneel\\", and now are trying to escape. They come to a walker- infested gas station, and Dwight laments that \\"Patty\\" is no longer there. Daryl attempts to escape with their supplies but discovers their bag includes insulin for a diabetic Tina. He returns, demanding Dwight turn over his gun in exchange for the insulin, when the group is attacked by more men in a truck led by Wade (Darin Cooper). Wade demands Dwight, Sherry, and Tina return what they took. Daryl is able to help them escape, in turn luring one of Wade's men into a walker. The walker bites the man in the arm, forcing Wade to cut the man's arm off therefore ending their pursuit. Daryl continues with Dwight, Sherry and Tina and come to the remains of a greenhouse. Tina sees two figures encased in melted glass, but when she tries to examine them, the figures are still re-animated walkers that break free of the glass and kill her. Daryl helps the two dispatch the walkers and bury Tina. Daryl then considers bringing them to Alexandria, though does not tell them of the location. When they agree, he leads them back to his motorcycle, after which Dwight puts Daryl at gunpoint and demands his crossbow and motorcycle. Daryl turns them over, and Dwight and Sherry take off. Continuing on his own, Daryl finds a fuel truck, with a license plate \\"PATTY002\\", nearby, and realizes this was the \\"Patty\\" Dwight sought. He takes the truck to rejoin his friends. Meanwhile, Sasha and Abraham fend off their attackers, and determine the attackers were lying in wait to ambush another party. They find an insurance office in a nearby town and hole up there, leaving signs for Daryl to locate them. In the office, a walker is trapped in a glass-enclosed conference room, which Abraham wants to kill. Sasha reminds him of the consequences of his actions as they are trying to otherwise stay hidden until Daryl can find them. The next morning, Abraham scavenges the local area, and finds an abandoned Humvee containing RPGs and a box of cigars, on a bridge. Hanging precariously from the bridge is a reanimated soldier with the RPG launcher slung over its shoulder. Abraham recklessly manages to get the launcher but nearly at the cost of his own life. He returns to the office with his finds, and apologizes to Sasha that he does act without thought, and wants to be a better person with her help. Later, he finds a partial Army dress uniform and dons it as he and Sasha set off to meet Daryl. They find him with the truck, and the three start to head back to Alexandria, but hear a cry for help over the truck's radio.

The episode was written by Channing Powell and directed by David Boyd. This episode reveals the unresolved fate of Glenn Rhee after the episode \\"Thank You\\" and builds tension for the mid-season finale \\"Start to Finish.\\" It adapts the rope-climbing scene from \\"Volume 14, \\"Issue #81\\" of the comic book series. Plot After being knocked off the garbage dumpster by Nicholas' corpse, Glenn crawls under the dumpster to evade the walkers that have surrounded it. Time passes and the walkers disperse, and Glenn is found by Enid. In a nearby store, Enid explains that she had fled Alexandria when the Wolves attacked it, and before Glenn can learn more, she runs off. Glenn discovers the body of David and his note to Betsy, and decides to chase after Enid. He catches up to her in a restaurant, and despite her holding a gun to him, Glenn manages to convince Enid to accompany him back to Alexandria. En route, they find some balloons that they use to distract the walkers to keep the way clear. In Alexandria, Rick assesses the damage from the Wolves' attack, and finds a section of wall where blood is dribbling from, and starts working to re-enforce it, aware his hammering is luring more walkers to the walls. Tobin joins Rick to help with the repairs, admitting to Rick that their group brought many changes to Alexandria but the remainder of them are adapting and thankful for their help. Elsewhere, Carl provides handgun lessons to Ron, but refuses to allow Ron to use live ammunition. Ron sneaks into the armory to obtain cartridges for the gun. Morgan is forced to tell Rick and Michonne that he had let the Wolves that they had captured escape. Morgan justifies his actions by reminding Rick that he had previously spared Morgan's life, and that while he had wanted to kill the Wolves before, he believes people can change. Later Morgan discreetly meets with Denise, acting as Alexandria's doctor, and tells her he needs her help to treat somebody injured. Morgan leads Denise to the lone Wolf he had secured in one townhouse, but his actions are witnessed by Carol, who follows them inside and demands to see who he has captured. Spencer attempts to climb over the Alexandria walls to lead some of the walkers away, but ends up falling. Tara helps to dispatch walkers while Rick and Tobin recover Spencer back inside Alexandria. Spencer explains his actions as trying to follow what Rick had wanted to do earlier, but had excluded any of the Alexandrians from helping. In the distance, they spot balloons rising above the walls, and Maggie realizes it is a sign from Glenn. Just then, the old church tower, which had been shown deteriorating throughout the episode, topples onto the wall segment that Rick and Tobin were trying to reinforce, crashing through it and allowing walkers to flood into Alexandria. Production This episode marks the return of Steven Yeun (Glenn Rhee) after a temporary absence. With this episode, Steven Yeun, who plays Glenn, is added back into the opening credits. His name had been removed for the previous three episodes after \\"Thank You\\" had left his status unknown. Reception=Critical reception The episode received mixed reviews from critics. As of 2015, it holds a 52% rating with an average score of 7.2 out of 10 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. The critics' consensus reads: \\"With \\"Heads Up,\\" The Walking Dead offers the resolution to a major cliffhanger, but with frustrating results.\\" Matt Fowler of IGN gave it a 7.0 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict: \\"The best parts of \\"Heads Up\\" were definitely the beginning - which finally cleared up the whole Glenn debate/debacle - and the very end when the building came crashing down, breaking the town's big barrier. Everything else was just there to lead us up to bigger things. Bigger developments. Better stories.

The Empress was due to depart from Felixstowe in the Royal Yacht Victoria and Albert. The Stour was laid with crimson carpet on the deck and seating arranged under an awning. The Stour was brought alongside Felixstowe pier, on which a large crowd had assembled to witness the departure. However, a small steam launch belonging to the Victoria and Albert was kept in a corner of the Felixstowe Dock, and the Empress transferred from her carriage to the launch, and reached the Victoria and Albert without using the Stour. On 16 June 1898, while crossing from Felixstowe to Harwich, Stour ran into the Trinity boat anchored off Felixstowe.

History  A coal mine was established at Bajiaogou (芭蕉沟) in 1938. The coal was initially transported in manually-propelled trucks on a gauge railway track to Mamio, where the coal was loaded onto barges on the Mabian river.BaShi Railway. auf: railwaysofchina.com To make transport more efficient, the construction of a long narrow-gauge railway line to Shixi, with a gauge of , began in 1958. The line was formally inaugurated on 12 July 1959. In 1960 it was re-gauged to . The station at Mifengyan is part of a zig zag. Initially, coal wagons were used to carry both coal and passengers. In the 1960s, trains with separate coal and passenger rolling stock became available. In 1975, six pairs of passenger-only trains operated daily, independently from the coal transport, but that was reduced to four passenger trains per day over the years. Additional mines near Jiaoba and Yuejin, Sichuan, were also connected to the railway line. In 2000 the Yuejin–Shixi line was electrified with 550V DC. The transport of coal on the remainder was discontinued in 2003, but passenger trains still operated, due to the lack of a road connection. In May 2004 the local government requested that the line be maintained as a heritage railway, as more and more tourists became interested in it. In 2010 it was listed as national cultural heritage. Tickets for tourists cost ¥80, but locals are only charged ¥0.5.  Rolling stock  Initially converted lorries were used, later steam locomotives probably of the RJ type.R. N. Pritchard: Industrial Locomotives of the People's Republic of China. Industrial Railway Society, Melton Mowbray 2008, . After re-gauging larger ZM16-4-C2 steam locomotives were used.

Two SJ380A diesel engines with numbers 01 and 02 were purchased and commissioned in 1991. They were already taken out of use in 1996. For the electrified part of the line between Shixi and Yuejin three ZL 14-7 electrical locomotives with four wheels each were purchased in the year 2000. Coal was initially transported in waggons with a bamboo superstructure, later with a wooden superstructure and today two axle steel waggons are being used. For the passenger service two axle carriages with open windows are used, and for checked-in luggage there are four axle carriages available. The tourist carriages have also four axles. Their windows are covered by transparent plastic and some of them are painted in brown.

Additionally, one or two pairs of trains are used daily for coal transport between Huangcunjing and Shixi. Special trains for tourists are available on request. For these only tourist carriages are being used. One or two tourist carriages are also added to normal passenger trains. All of these trains are pulled by ZM16-4 steam locomotives, even on the electrified section of the line. The locomotives are refilled in Yuejin station on their way to Huangcunjing. Coal is transported between Yuejing and Shixi by electric locomotives. One ZL 14-7 goes forward and backwards between the loading and unloading stations.

Description Chlorophylle is set in a European forest, more specifically in the animal kingdom of Coquefredouille. It's a world in itself and a mini anthropomorphic version of human society. All albums center around Chlorophylle, a dormouse who often has to solve problems and opponents who are much bigger than himself. The stories were originally set in a realistic natural environment, but after 1963 Macherot changed it to a more humanized animal world.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/m/macherot.htm Despite their funny animal appearance the stories were notable for their satirical edge.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/m/macherot.htm Characters * Chlorophylle: A red dormouse with a black circle around his eye. He is smart, generous and brave. * Minimum: A mouse and Chlorophylle's best friend. He is smaller and more obese than Chlorophylle. Due to his stupidity and more impulsive behaviour he serves as Chlorophylle's sidekick and comic relief. He debuted in the second album, \\"Chlorphylle et les Conspirateurs\\". * Serpolet: A white rabbit and good friend of Chlorophylle. He debuted in \\"Chlorophylle contre les rats noirs\\". * Bitume: An owl who is one of Chlorophylle's friends. He debuted in \\"Chlorophylle contre les rats noirs\\". * Torpille: An otter, also a friend of Chlorophylle. * Mitron XIII: A mouse who is the king of Coquefredouille. * Anthracite: A huge black rat who is Chlorophylle's arch nemesis. He is the leader of an army of black rats and hungers for power and luxury. In many stories he tries to kill off Chlorophylle once and for all. Anthracite was such a colorful character that Macherot explicitly secured the rights to the character when he left his publisher Lombard. In Macherot's other comics series, Sibylline, the rat character Anathème Percemiche is Anthracite's brother. * Célimène: The cat of a notary. He debuts in \\"Pas de Salami pour Célimène\\" (1957), where he threatens Chlorphylle and his friends to bring him some meat, in exchange for their lives. * Zizanion aka The duke Bihoreau de Bellerente: A heron who conspires to take over Mitron's XIII's throne.

For every second the escapees survive, they gain 50 in-game credits, which will accumulate over the first eight episodes for the finals (ninth episode). If the escapees are caught by the hunters, they will be eliminated and are permitted to keep only ten percent of their credits for that particular round. Meanwhile, they have to complete certain tasks thrown to them in a given time frame while hiding from the hunters. If the escapees find a \\"refuge\\", they can choose to sign out and leave with the credits they have. If the escapees survive the whole course of 90 minutes(sometimes 100 minutes), they will be handsomely rewarded with 270,000 credits(or 300,000 in a 100-minute game). The hunters cannot have any sort of communication with the escapees. They can only sprint when they see an escapee, and they cannot determine the escapee's location by looking for the cameramen. If the escapees manage to hide or run away from the hunter, the hunter will give up the chase.

History The ship was built by the Thames Graving Dock Company in London in 1866. She was placed on the Harwich to Antwerp cargo service. She was the first screw steamer in the Great Eastern Railway Company fleet. The hold was built with a double lining, which could hold 100 tons of water, and had a powerful steam pump independent of the main engines connected to clear it. On each side were bunkers capable of storing 100 tons of coal. On 28 December 1868 she came to the rescue of the steamship Berussia which had broken her main shaft on a voyage from New York to Hamburg. An attempt to tow the Berussia failed and the Great Yarmouth took some of the passengers and transferred them to Portland. She was sold to in 1873 to Thomas Gage Beatley and later ended up in the ownership of Mr Joseph Reay of Newcastle. She was stranded at Skutskär in the Åland Islands in 1887, and a strong sea later destroyed the vessel.

The main products were vessels, steam engines and combustion engines. The company was founded in 1914 to continue shipbuilding operations of W:m Crichton & C:o which had bankrupted in the previous year. It was merged to its neighbour and competitor Aktiebolaget Vulcan in 1924. The succeeding shipbuilding company Ab Crichton-Vulcan Oy grew the biggest shipbuilding company of Finland.  Background  The preceding company was founded in 1842 as Cowie & Eriksson. At the beginning the main products were steam engines. The company was taken over by local businessman Erik Julin and Scottish William Crichton in 1862 and was named W:m Crichton & C:o, after which it extended to shipbuilding. The main customers came from Imperial Russia and the most significant one was the Imperial Russian Navy. After Crichton's death in 1889 the company was led by Englishman John Eager. At the end of the 19th century the main owners were Saint Petersburg investors and local businessmen, brothers Ernst and Magnus Dahlström.Knorring: Crichtonin yrityksen parhaat vuodet. pp. 67–73. In order to maintain its position in the Russian market, the company leased premises in Malaya Okhta, Saint Petersburg, in 1896 for building ships for the navy. Due to poor management, wrongly calculated prices and delay payments, the new branch caused such significant losses, that the whole company bankrupted in spring 1913.Knorring: Ochtan telakka. pp. 73–75.  New start  W:m Crichton & C:o was officially filed for bankruptcy on 24 April 1913. The estate announced that the claims of trading house C. M. Dahlström, owned by the Dahlström brothers, reached over 4.5 million marks. Therefore, the Dahlström brothers took immediate actions to defend their assets. The Okhta yard was closed and in the following year its moveables were sold. At Turku yard only such property was sold which was not necessary for production.Knorring: Käännekohdasta konkurssiin. pp. 75–79. From summer 1913 the yard was operated under name C.J. Dahlström. In June 1914 a new company was started under name Aktiebolaget Crichton; the owners wanted to keep the reputable name.Grönros et al.: Konepaja- ja telakkateollisuuden historiaa. pp. 6–20. All questions about property were settled with the estate and Ab Crichton started free from debt. The share capital consisted of 2 000 shares, each of them having 1 000 marks value.  Initial production  Ab Crichton hired Sten Harald Stenovich Lundsten, the former financial manager of the Okhta shipyard, to represent the company in Saint Petersburg. Later he got a broad mandate to sign sales contracts. Lundsten chased for orders to Ab Crichton in an environment of corruption and machination. The economic situation was favourable for Ab Crichton. The Russian economy was in upswing and the newly founded shipbuilder received orders for 12 tugboats with 140-hp engine power for 1913–1914. Eleven orders came from Russia, one from nearby Korpo lime company. In addition, the company produced ten steam engines for Saint Petersburg customers. During the first year, the company employed already 400 people. The most important customer of the preceding company, the Imperial Russian Navy, did not place any orders in 1914, although Europe was under threat of war. However, Ab Crichton got an order through detour for eight motor cutters for Nikolayev shipyard at Black Sea. The yard had outsourced the project to Turku Andrée & Rosenqvist company, which further outsourced it to Ab Crichton. The terms of the deal were strict regarding maximum weight and minimum speed, but Ab Crichton fulfilled the requirements of the 156 900 rubles deal. Probably the reason for the outsourcing was that Andrée & Rosenqvist did not have experience about steel hull vessels powered by a compound steam engine.Energiaa (Meronen, Mikko): Ensimmäisen maailmansodan tilaukset. pp. 77–80.  First World War  The outburst of the First World War in August 1914 made all companies cautious and subsequently they reduced headcount drastically. Ab Crichton fired the whole personnel, but after the situation had stabilised within a few weeks, the company started hiring the workers back, albeit for a 20% lower salary. Also the weekly working hours were reduced from 56 to 40. The reduced salaries caused angger amongst the workers – they believed the previous dismissals being just an excuse for cutting down the wages. In February 1915 Ab Crichton got an order for five 56-feet motor cutters. It is not known whether the order came directly from the Admiralty or again through one or more middlemen. Each vessel featured a 240-hp steam engine. The company did not get more orders for newbuildings later in the same year, but it got a significant project for reconditioning of four torpedo boats. Ab Crichton got an order for four 162-feet steamers in February 1916. The customer is not known, but most likely it was the Admiralty, that used the boats later for patrolling in the Finnish archipelago. The order led to shortage of workforce, and in May Ab Crichton published an announcement on newspapers, that the company sought for numerous sheet metal workers. The total headcount reached 500 at the end of the year. During the same year the company delivered 14 steam engines, some boilers and pumps to Saint Petersburg. In October the company got two orders for vessels: the first one included two 40-feet motor cutters and the second one four 185-feet steamers. The future looked bright. In August 1916 the Dahlström brothers sold the company to Helsinki-based Emissions Aktiebolaget. One third of the shares were transferred shortly after to a consortium formed by Freiherr Carolus Wrede and Ernst, Edgar and Berndt Grönblom. The rest of the shares were offered to public market. The new shareholders had a meeting in September 1916. Freiherr Carolus Wrede became the chairman, Ernst Grönblom was selected deputy chairman and the director of the board became Erik von Frenckell. The company manager became Freiherr Rabbe Wrede. the share capital was increased to six million marks, comprising 6,000 shares, each of 1,000 marks' value. In order to answer the increased demand, the number of personnel was raised. At the end of 1916, the headcount reached its peak being 1,059 people. the following turbulent times reduced order intake and in 1917 the company employed only 705 people any more. In January 1917 Ab Crichton got an order for two 162-feet steamers. They were similar to the four patrolling ships ordered in the previous year. But these six ships were cancelled, probably due to the February Revolution. After this, the yard had no orders in the same year, and the only note on the order book logged in November included a work order of four compound engines, which were produced to storage, most likely just for employment reasons. Finland became independent in the same December. While many of the Finnish company managers ideologically supported the Finnish independence, the subsequent loss of the Russian market was disastrous to a number of Finnish engineering companies. Moreover, many companies lost their receivables during the Russian revolution and the nationalising of banks. Losses of Ab Crichton were altogether 1,283,018 marks. In 1918 the company got just one order for a new ship which was a tugboat. Another one came for a steam engine. The most significant order was a repair project of SS Bore I, which employed 100 men until 1921. The previously started two 40-feet motor cutters were sold to the Imperial German Navy in 1918. The four patrol steamers were transferred to the state of Finland; two of them became gunboats Turunmaa and Karjala, and two others were sold to the Polish Navy in 1920. This helped the company to gain back a part of the receivables lost during the Russian revolution.  Post-war recession  The early 1920s were difficult years for Ab Crichton. The company managed to sell some steam engines in Finland, but for a long time there were no orders for new ships. The very last ship order for Ab Crichton came on 29 February 1924 from city of Turku; the vessel was an icebreaker-tugboat with a 380-hp engine output.  Merger  Discussions about merger between Ab Crichton and the neighbouring Ab Vulcan started already in the early 1920s. The initiative came most likely from Ab Vulcan, which was managed by Allan Staffans. The aim was creating a larger and financially stable company that could compete for the expected orders of the new Finnish Navy, which was at the beginning of creating itse own fleet. Ab Crichton appointed Carolus Wrede to manager position in 1922 to lead the negotiations. Articles for association for the new company were presented to the board of Ab Vulcan in December 1923. The merger was put into practice in winter 1924, and on 14 May 1924 the local newspaper Åbo Underrättelser reported, that the companies are merged and the new company Ab Crichton-Vulcan Oy is established. The merger too officially place in the constituent meeting on 18 August.

She supported Japanese forces during the invasion of Malaya in December 1941 and the Dutch East Indies campaign in early 1942. Background Following World War I, the Imperial Japanese Navy re-evaluated the use submarine warfare as an element of fleet strategy due to the successful deployment of long-range cruiser-submarines for commerce raiding by the major combatant navies. Japanese strategists came to realize possibilities for using the weapon for long range reconnaissance, and in a war of attrition against an enemy fleet approaching Japan.Peatty, pp. 212–14 Two large, long-range Japanese submarines had already been built under the Eight-six fleet program as prototype ( and ), however, the arrival on 20 June 1919 of seven German U-boats received by Japan as war reparations at the end of World War I led to a complete re-design. The Japanese quickly hired hundreds of German submarine engineers, technicians and former U-boat officers unemployed by the defeat of Germany in World War I, and brought them to Japan under 5-year contracts. The American ONI (Office of Naval Intelligence) estimated that some 800 German advisors had gone to Japan by the end of 1920. The Japanese also sent delegations to Germany, and were active in purchasing many patents.Boyd, pp. 17–18 Design and description The submarines of the KD3A sub-class were the first mass-produced Japanese- designed cruiser submarines.Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 170 Based largely on the indigenous Kaidai Type II (I-52) a strengthened double hull, their design was also influenced by the largest of the German submarines in Japanese hands, the SM U-125.Stille', p. 4 They displaced surfaced and submerged. The submarines were long, had a beam of and a draft of . The boats had a diving depth of and a complement of 60 officers and crewmen.Carpenter & Polmar, p. 93 The hull had almost the same outer dimensions as the I-52, but the increased thickness of the inner hull permitted a diving depth of 60 meters. Internal volume was slightly increased by making the hull slightly trapezoidal in cross-section, at the expense of 300 tons of additional displacement. External differences included an anti-submarine net cutter on the bow, as well as an O-ring for towing purposes. Sulzer was retained as the manufacturer for the diesel engines, which had a slightly improved performance over the engines in the I-52. For surface running, the boats were powered by two diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged each propeller was driven by a electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, the KD3As had a range of at ; submerged, they had a range of at .Chesneau, p. 198 The boats were armed with eight internal torpedo tubes, six in the bow and two in the stern. They carried one reload for each tube; a total of 16 torpedoes. They were also armed with one deck gun for combat on the surface.Bagnasco, p. 183 Construction and commissiong Built by the Kure Naval Arsenal, I-53 was laid down on 1 April 1924 as and renamed on 1 November. The boat was launched on 5 August 1925 and completed on 30 March 1927. Service history=Pre-war Upon commissioning, I-53 was attached to the Kure Naval District. On 5 September 1927, Submarine Division 18 was established within the district, and she was assigned to the new division.Hackett & Kingsepp I-53 was operating on the surface in limited visibility in the Pacific Ocean off Honshu, Japan, on 27 February 1936 when she suffered an engine failure and the submarine I-55 accidentally rammed her southeast of Daiosaki lighthouse. Both submarines suffered minor damage. By November 1941, Submarine Division 18, which also included and , was a part of Submarine Squadron 4. The division was based at Sanya, Hainan Island, China, in December 1941 in preparation for the coming conflict in the Pacific. World War IIFirst war patrol= Just before the attack on Pearl Harbor, I-53 began a patrol north of the Anambas Islands to support \\"Operation E\\", the Japanese invasion of Malaya. Hostilities began in East Asia on 8 December 1941 (7 December across the International Date Line in Hawaii, where Japan began the war with its attack on Pearl Harbor). After an uneventful patrol, I-53 arrived at Cam Ranh in Japanese-occupied French Indochina. =Second war patrol= I-53 began her second war patrol on 29 December 1941, departing Cam Ranh, but suffered damage in heavy seas, forcing her to return to Cam Ranh on 31 December for repairs. Her repairs completed, she again departed Cam Ranh on 6 January 1942 and took up a patrol position northwest of Java. She returned to Cam Ranh on 24 January. =Third war patrol= I-53 departed Cam Ranh on 7 February 1942 to begin her third war patrol. She transited the Lombok Strait on 20 February and entered the Indian Ocean, where she torpedoed and sank the Dutch 917-gross-register-ton auxiliary tanker Ben 2 – which was on a voyage from Surabaya, Java, to Australia with a cargo of artillery shells – southwest of Banyuwangi, Java, on 27 February. On 28 February, she torpedoed the British 8,917-gross-register-ton armed cargo ship City of Manchester in the Indian Ocean at , inflicting further damage on the ship with gunfire. The burning City of Manchester soon sank. I-53 completed her patrol on 8 March 1942, arriving at Staring-baai, Celebes. =Kure= Submarine Squadron 4 was disbanded on 10 March 1942, and I-53 was assigned to the Kure Guard Unit in Japanese home waters. Departing Staring Bay on 16 March, she arrived at Kure, Japan, on 25 March, and assumed duties as a training ship. She suffered minor damage when the submarine tender grazed her in the Inland Sea on 6 May 1942, and on 20 May 1942 she was renumbered I-153. On 5 January 1943, I-153 took part in a Naval Submarine School submarine camouflage experiment in the Inland Sea in which she and the submarine had a black camouflage scheme applied to their upper hulls and conning tower sides.

The university is located in Nagaon and is named after him.Sankaradeva University classes from 2014 History Imaginary portrait of Srimanta Sankardev by Bishnu Prasad Rabha Mahapurusha Srimanta Sankaradeva (1449-1568) worked in diverse fields like religion, literature, music, dance, drama, architecture, and social reconstruction. He translated most of the Bhâgavata Mahapurana into the Assamese language and was the first playwright in any Indian language other than Sanskrit. He wrote more than twenty six scriptures mostly in the Assamese language besides the Brajawali form and one in Sanskrit. He composed lyrics/songs including the Borgeets. All these justified the name of Sarvagunakara by his disciple Madhabadeva. He was a humanist and welcomed everyone, irrespective of caste, creed, or sex into his order. He was a pioneer in adult education and mass communication, and called upon the society to educate women and the downtrodden people. Srimanta Sankaradeva initiated a new form of painting with his drama-festival Chihna- Yâtrâ held in 1468 A.D. where he drew the imaginary pictures of heaven to be used as backdrops. He encouraged illustration of his manuscripts with pictorial depiction of stories from the Bhâgavata. The Nâmghar founded by him has become a multi-dimensional institution and symbol of Assamese society. He visited many places of the Indian sub-continent and his impact was clearly felt in those regions, be it Yâtrâ of Bengal, scroll painting of Odisha, plays of Mithila, etc. Srimanta Sankaradeva Sangha was set up in 1930 in order to carry forward the reforms initiated by the saint. It is the largest NGO in North East India and it has been working relentlessly among the masses for inculcating the values preached by Srimanta Sankaradeva. It runs several schools in the state. The Sangha envisaged to establish a university and authorised its Srimanta Sankaradeva Education and Socio-Economic Development Trust, Nagaon to sponsor its establishment of the university. The Sangha submitted a proposal to the government of Assam for the establishment of the university under the Assam Private Universities Act, 2007.

It was the cultural capital of the Bahurutshe people, one of the principal Tswana tribes and a centre of manufacturing and trading. The missionary, John Campbell, came across this settlement in the Tshwenyane hills of the Marico in 1820, at which time its population of 20 000 exceeded that of Cape Town. Archaeologists estimate that it had been founded in the late 1400s on the site of iron and copper ore deposits. In 1821, during the Mfecane, the town was sacked by the Batlokwa under the warrior queen, Mantatisi. The attack was followed round 1823 by another under Sebetwane and the Bafokeng tribe. The survivors fled west and sought sanctuary among the Bakwena and other Tswana tribes. Crumbling stone walls, foundations, ash middens and remains of a metal working industry are the only evidence of the settlement's previous existence. In 2011 the ruins were declared a National Heritage Site by the Government.

He is known for his abstract and conceptual photography. Commercially, Enciso works as a director, photographer and art director.  Work  Enciso's work oscillates between the abstract, conceptual and graphic art. He utilizes computer software for 3D modeling, digital painting and design from which he conceives work that is turned into physical pieces. In photography he does visual research exploring with “on camera” techniques such as filters, light and visual illusions. Formally, his work is intended to expand the limits of visual perception and aesthetics. At the social level, Enciso's work is concerned with environmental, political, health, technological, human rights, animal rights and ethical matters. His work across all disciplines depicts emotions and personal stories with an underlying spiritual subtext.  Recent Work  On his work Symbols, in search of incongruity and the unexpected, Enciso embarked on long, slow walks in Los Angeles and cities in Mexico to find lived-in places, marked by prior actions and behavior. His street photography engaged with the traces of strangers, a play between unknown actors where streets became scenes. Sometimes he created his own interventions, interacting with certain objects or constructions with the intent to leave something behind for someone else to encounter. As a photographer, Enciso is not a documentarian but rather someone who is interested in the potential of everyday scenes and objects to create an emotional or conceptual impression. Seeing the ordinary as extraordinary, he makes arrangements within the frame of his viewfinder by manipulating objects, shapes and forms through processes of call, response and spontaneous improvisation. “Symbols is Enciso’s love letter to the lived-in city and a testament to his openness, awareness and sensitivity.

Built about 1757 by one of Harpswell's early settlers, it is one of the town's oldest buildings. It was also the subject of a well-meaning but ill-informed Colonial Revival \\"restoration\\" in the 1940s, illustrating some of the issues with those types of actions. The property, which includes the Dunning family cemetery, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. Description and history The Dunning House stands on a parcel of more than of land on the east side of the main Harpswell peninsula, just south of Mountain Road near its crossing to the town's eastern peninsula. Most of this land, which has always been historically associated with the house, is wooded, with a roughly area of meadow surrounding the house, which is accessed by a private lane (Old Dunning Road) to its west. The house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, three bays wide, with a single central chimney, side gable roof, clapboard siding, and stone foundation. Its main facade faces south, and has an enclosed gabled center entrance vestibule. The flanking sash windows on the first floor are place slightly irregularly, while those on the second floor, which are slightly smaller, have more regular positioning. It is not known if these window positions are original. The window positions on the east side appear to be original, although the windows themselves date to the 19th and 20th centuries. A breezeway extends from the rear of the house, connecting it to a two-bay garage with two-leaf swinging doors. The house was built c. 1757-60 by Andrew Dunning, originally from York, Maine, and is one of the town's oldest surviving buildings. Dunning was prominent in local civic affairs, serving as town selectman, town clerk, and deacon of the church for many years. The house was owned by Dunning's descendants until 1871, acquiring over time a number of additions and alterations, including gables in the roof, a two-story addition, and a porch across the front facade. Abandoned for many years, it was acquired in 1946 by a Gorham couple, who engaged in a \\"restoration\\" in which they sought to return the house to its 18th-century appearance. The accumulated alterations (some of which were documented in a pen-and-ink sketch dating to 1878) were removed, and the breezeway and garage added. Interior elements of the restoration included the reuse of wood paneling from another period Harpswell house (which was demolished) in some of the downstairs rooms. The restoration was the subject of media interest, receiving press coverage that included \\"before and after\\" photography.

Known for his interpretations of the works of Richard Wagner, he worked as a principal artist at many of the world's great opera houses, including the Deutsche Oper Berlin, La Scala, the Metropolitan Opera, and the Vienna State Opera. Life and career Brenneis was trained in the opera studio of the Berlin State Opera (BSO) where he began his performance career in the opera chorus during the 1950s. In 1958 he performed in the world premiere of Darius Milhaud's Fiesta at the BSO. In 1959 he began his career as a principal tenor at the Essen Opera House where he first appeared as Don Curzio in Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro. His first major critical success came soon after at that house in the title role of Britten's Albert Herring. From 1961-1972 Brenneis was a leading tenor at Theater Augsburg. Here he achieved a reputation as a gifted Wagnerian tenor in roles like Walther von Stolzing in Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, and the title heroes in Lohengrin and Parsifal. While still committed to Theater Augsburg, Brenneis was a principal artist at the Deutsche Oper am Rhein from 1970-1972. He was later under contract as a leading tenor at the Hamburg State Opera (1972-1977), the Staatsoper Stuttgart (1975-1977), and the Vienna State Opera (1976-1985). He made his debut at the Deutsche Oper Berlin in 1974 as Max in Der Freischütz, and was thereafter a resident artist at that house until 1996. One of his last great successes at that house was as Erik in Der fliegende Holländer in 1994. In addition to his portrayal of Wagner heroes, Brenneis excelled in the roles of Max in Der Freischütz and Dimitrij in Boris Godunov. He worked extensively as a guest artist during his career. He appeared in several roles at the Bayreuth Festival in 1973 and 1974, including Siegmund in Die Walküre, Walther von der Vogelweide in Tannhäuser, and Walther von Stolzing. In 1975 Brenneis made his debut at La Scala as Florestan in Fidelio under conductor Karl Böhm. In 1976, 1981, and 1983 he appeared as a guest artist at the Metropolitan Opera, portraying the roles of Froh in Das Rheingold, the Emperor in Die Frau ohne Schatten, Parsifal, Siegmund, Walther von Stolzing, and the title role in Tannhäuser. In 1988 he portrayed Siegfried in a complete production of Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen at the Opéra de Nice. Other important engagements included the Liceu (1977), New Orleans Opera (1977), the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino (1984), Teatro Regio di Turino (1984, 1988), and Pretoria Opera (1985). In 1981 he sang Lonengrin for his debut at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City. He portrayed the title role in the 1992 film version of Wagner's Rienzi with Jeannine Altmeyer as Irene.

Commodus (31 August 161 AD – 31 December 192 AD) was Roman Emperor from 180 to 192 and the son of the previous emperor, Marcus Aurelius.Adams, Geoff W. The Emperor Commodus: Gladiator, Hercules or a Tyrant?, 2013. Print.Hekster, Olivier. \\"The Roman Empire after His Death.\\" A Companion to Marcus Aurelius 96 (2012): 234. During his sole reign, he came to associate himself with the Greek hero, Herakles (whose myths were adopted in Rome under the name Hercules), eventually having a bust depicting him as the hero created near the end of his reign.  Symbolism  Here, the Roman Emperor has taken on the guise of the mythological hero, Hercules. He has been given the attributes of the hero: the lion skin placed over his head, the club placed in his right hand, and the golden apples of Hesperides in his left.Penny Small, Jocelyn. \\"Was Alexander the Great left-handed?.\\" Laterality 11.6 (2006): 562-565. Each of these objects has been placed as a reminder of the hero's accomplishments, as well as allowing the Emperor to associate and refer to himself as the Roman Hercules. At the base of the sculpture, carved into the globe are the zodiacal signs of Taurus, Capricorn, and Scorpio. The meaning behind these symbols has been somewhat debated since the discovery of the sculpture, with interpretations ranging from purely astrological to calendric.Hannah, Robert. “The Emperor's Stars: The Conservatori Portrait of Commodus”. American Journal of Archaeology 90.3 (1986): 337–342. Evidence pointing towards the latter of these two ideas has been presented by Professor Robert Hannah of The University of Waikato, who has pointed to the thought that these signs could represent the month of October, which the emperor had renamed after Hercules during his rule: > In this way, the signs are interpreted as an indication of the month of > October. October figured prominently at various stages of Commodus' life, > and indeed was renamed after Hercules by the Emperor. This calendric > interpretation can therefore be seen to emphasize the Herculean aspect of > the portrait. Base of the bust, which includes the globe and zodiacal symbols. The now single Amazon figure, cornucopia, and pelta can also be seen. Other sources argue that the three signs instead are linked to the foundations of the city of Rome. In this case, Taurus represents the founding of Rome under Romulus, which took place traditionally on the 21st of April, Capricorn represents Augustus, who regarded the sign as his, and finally Scorpio would represent the Emperor himself, as the third \\"founder\\" of the city. This popular theory also can be seen as Commodus once more emphasizing his association with Hercules, as Scorpio would fall into the month of October, which he had renamed after Hercules. Further decoration can be found surrounding the globe, from the kneeling Amazons to either side (one of which has been lost), to the cornucopia entangled with a pelta. Believed to be for the purpose of celebration, this idea is furthered by the inclusion of two Tritons, which are believed to represent his apotheosis.  Intent  There is speculation of the Emperor's intent by creating depictions of himself as a godlike figure. Some sources say it was Commodus's desire to be not merely the protegé of Hercules, but a god, the incarnation, the epiphany of Hercules.Rostovtseff, Michael, and Harold Mattingly. \\"Commodus-Hercules in Britain.\\" Journal of Roman Studies 13.1-2 (1923): 91-109. Others claim instead that he simply desired to be the center of attention and show his intense appreciation for games and spectacles. Archaeologist and museum director Mortimer Wheeler suggested that although the bust would have been made for Commodus or someone close to him at the court, and the mythological topic decided by the patron, the artist was deliberately subverting the flattering subject and casting the flamboyant emperor in an ironic light: the contrast between the trappings of Hercules, the real hero (lion hide and club, etc.), and the \\"effeminate\\" and self- obsessed emperor shown in stone here is too grotesque to be taken only as an idolizing portrait, and the hidden intention becomes ironic. \\"The sculptor must have felt very sure of his ground, protected by the blind vanity of his sitter\\".Wheeler, Mortimer (1964 repr 1985), Roman Art and Architecture  Further reading  * Robert Hannah, The Emperor's Stars: The Conservatori Portrait of Commodus, American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 90, No. 3, Jul. 1986 * Geoff W.

Kocurek (born October 2, 1964) is an American attorney and judge who is currently a Texas state court judge, having served as presiding judge of the 390th District Court in Austin, Texas since January 1999, being appointed by then-governor George W. Bush. Prior to serving as a Texas state judge, Kocurek served as an Assistant District Attorney in Travis County for seven years. On November 6, 2015, Kocurek survived an assassination attempt outside of her Austin home. She returned to work in February 2016.  Early life  Originally from Dayton, Texas, Kocurek graduated from Dayton High School, then received a B.A. in economics from the University of Texas at Austin, and a J.D. from St. Mary's University School of Law in 1990. Kocurek was an Assistant District Attorney in the Travis County District Attorney's Office for seven years, under District Attorney Ronnie Earle. She became board certified in criminal law in 1998, and in 1999 was appointed by Governor George W. Bush to a seat on the newly created 390th district court, becoming the first female district judge in Travis County.  State judicial service  Her caseload has included presiding over cases brought against Texas governor Rick Perry and U.S Congressman Tom DeLay. In Perry's case, Kocurek presided briefly before recusing herself from the matter due to her previous association with the Travis County District Attorney's Office, and transferring the matter to judge Billy Ray Stubblefield, who assigned the matter to senior state district judge Bert Richardson. Kocurek dispelled a claim made by former Alaska governor Sarah Palin that the case had been brought by Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, whom Perry had tried to force from office.  Assassination attempt  On November 6, 2015, Kocurek was shot and seriously wounded by an assailant in the driveway of her home in the Tarrytown neighborhood. Kocurek lost a finger due to the attack, but was able to return to the courtroom by February 2016.\\"Standing ovation welcomes Judge Kocurek back into the courtroom\\", KXAN-TV (February 28, 2016). On April 26, 2018, a federal jury found Chimene Onyeri guilty of all 17 counts charged against him, including charges related to the assassination attempt. Onyeri was found guilty of fraud, theft, and a racketeering charge linked to the attempted murder of Judge Kocurek and was sentenced to life in federal prison. Had Kocurek died from her injuries, Onyeri would've received the death penalty.

Usually burette clamps come in doubles, which means they can hold two burettes. Burettes can be held by varying methods, some including the ones suggested below. To use a burette clamp, you should fix the burette on a stand, squeeze the handle, and the rubber knobs will separate from each other. The burette clamp will then be put between the rubber knobs.

Stevens was born in Meriden, Connecticut, in 1898, the son of Frank A. Stevens and Harriet M. Beech. After serving briefly in the United States Army in 1918, he graduated from Princeton University in 1920. Stevens earned a J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1923, after which he moved to Philadelphia and was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar. He worked for the firm of Henry, Pepper, Bodine and Stokes (now Pepper Hamilton LLP) before becoming a founding member of Stradley, Ronon, Stevens and Young in 1926. He remained a partner in the firm for the rest of his life. He married Elizabeth Morgan (1903-2003Elizabeth Morgan Stevens (1903-2003, Find A Grave.) in 1929; they had four children. Stevens was involved in politics in Philadelphia, initially as a Republican. He soon grew dissatisfied with the Republican machine that then dominated the city's politics. In 1939, Stevens ran for district attorney on a ticket backed by Democrats and independent Republicans, but was unsuccessful, losing to regular Republican Charles F. Kelley by 30,000 votes. He continued to be active in the city's reform movement and the Republican Party. In 1947, he was appointed chief counsel of the United States Senate's Banking and Currency Committee, which was then investigating the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, an independent agency of the federal government created during the Great Depression. The following year, he became the Layman Moderator of the Philadelphia branch of the government of the Presbyterian Church. In 1949, Stevens helped organize the Greater Philadelphia Movement, which worked for reform of city government and adoption of a new city charter. That mission was fulfilled in 1951, when city voters adopted the new charter Stevens and the Movement had drafted. Later that year, Stevens ran for one of the at-large seats on the reformed city council. He ran as a Democrat and was elected, part of a wave election that swept the Republicans from power for the first time in 67 years. Stevens won the second-highest vote total of any of the seven at-large candidates elected. He served as the chairman of City Council's Finance Committee. In 1955, he declined to run for reelection, and returned to his law practice and charitable organizations, which included memberships on the boards of the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia, the Presbyterian Hospital of Philadelphia, and Lincoln University, among others. In March 1963, Stevens suffered a stroke and underwent brain surgery. He lived for four more months, but ultimately succumbed to illness and died in Temple University Hospital on July 15, 1963. He is buried in the churchyard of Saint Thomas Episcopal Church in Whitemarsh, Pennsylvania.

She published more than 175 works during her long career.  Early life and education  Marie Lebour was born the youngest of three daughters to Emily and George Lebour in Woodburn, Northumberland on 20 August 1876. Her father was a professor of geology and Marie regularly joined him on expeditions, collecting specimens for her own collections. She attended Armstrong College and studied art, then went on to Durham University, where she earned degrees in zoology: an associate degree in 1903, bachelor's degree in 1904, master's degree in 1907, and doctorate in 1917.  Career and research  In 1900, before beginning her scientific education, Lebour began her research career with a paper on land and freshwater mollusks in Northumberland. While studying for her master's degree, Lebour was on staff at Durham University. From 1906–1909, she was a demonstrator in the University of Leeds Department of Zoology; from 1909–1915 she was also an assistant lecturer. Lebour's professional research career was entirely conducted at the Marine Biological Association's Laboratory at Plymouth,where she joined the research staff in 1915. She was a full staff member there until 1946, then an honorary staff member until she could no longer conduct research due to health problems, in 1964. Her main research interest was the larval stages of both trematodes (a type of mollusk parasite) and mollusks themselves. She published more than 100 papers on these topics during her career. She also worked on microplankton, and discovered at least 28 new species, which she cataloged in two books. After publishing these books, Lebour used the newly invented plunger jar to better study the egg and larval stages of krill in the North Atlantic, Antarctica, and Bermuda. She also published well-regarded work on the eggs and larvae of sprat, herring, and pilchards. She also conducted research in West Africa. She retired at the age of 70, in 1946, but continued to work into the laboratory and publish until she was 88 and her failing vision prevented her from working at the microscope. She died on 2 October 1971, at the age of 95. Many of Lebour's publications are still used by researchers.  Honors and legacy  Lebour was a member of several professional societies. She was a fellow of the Linnaean Society, a lifetime fellow of the Zoological Society, and a member of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom. She was remembered fondly by her colleagues.

Biography The son of a baptist hotelier, Constandse completed the normal school between 1914 and 1918 and in this period came into contact with the teetotalers movement. In response to World War I, he developed anti-militarist ideas. He joined the Social-Anarchist Youth Organisation (Dutch Sociaal-Anarchistische Jeugd Organisatie, SAJO) in 1919. Within this organisation, he chose the side of the individualist faction within this organisation when factional struggles erupted, denouncing even trade organizations as counterrevolutionary. Instead of taking a job as a teacher, Constandse devoted himself to spreading anarchist ideas. He published two anarchist monthlies, Alarm (1922–1926) and Opstand (\\"Revolt\\", 1926–1928), which together with Herman Schuurman's De Moker and Arthur Lehning's Grondslagen renewed the theoretical basis of Dutch anarchism. Constandse's 1927 call for mutiny in De Vrije Socialist (\\"the free socialist\\"), following the sending of HNLMS Sumatra to Shanghai, led to a conviction for sedition and a prison sentence of two months. During the 1930, Constandse focused on combating fascism. The rise of Adolf Hitler in Germany led Constandse to drop his antimilitarist ideas. He considered the Spanish Civil War a last chance for anarchist revolution, and abandoned revolutionary anarchism after the war had been lost by the Republican forces, instead laying down a Reichian theory of fascism's success as stemming from the proletariat's desire for a strict father figure. Having married, he also successfully studied for a position as a French teacher, but was barred from such a position by a 1933 law that prohibited schools from hiring members of leftist organisations. On 7 October 1940, the German occupation force had Constandse arrested and sent to the concentration camps; he was at Buchenwald for thirteen months, followed by a string of smaller concentration camps ending with Kamp Vught. In September 1944 this camp was evicted, and Constandse was freed. He spent the \\"hunger winter\\" of 1944 in The Hague. After the war, Constandse was hired as a journalist by Algemeen Handelsblad editor D.J. von Balluseck, whom he had met in captivity. He came to lead the newspaper's foreign desk, espousing views that ran counter to the Cold War ideology of the time, criticizing both Soviet and US policies as detrimental to world peace. A 1956 editorial in which Constandse argued against Western intervention in the Hungarian Uprising, for fear that it would lead to nuclear war, even caused a scuffle at the paper's news desk. Constandse remained on the Handelsblad's editorial board until retiring in 1964. During the same period, he edited the Dutch Society for Sexual Reform's magazine. After retirement, he continued writing for De Groene Amsterdammer and Vrij Nederland, as well as making radio programs for the VPRO and lecturing on Spanish and Latin American history at the University of Amsterdam. In the cultural upheavals of the 1960s Constandse became an example to many of the rebellious new generation, and he reformulated his anarchist ideals as a reformist cultural movement rather than a politically revolutionary ideology. From 1973 he also edited the anarchist magazine De AS, until a conflict arose over his defending the Socialist Party's publication of a brochure calling for compulsory integration of (especially Muslim) immigrant workers; Constandse criticized Islam as a patriarchal religion that opposed birth control.

It was claimed by government that the controversial security upgrades to President Jacob Zuma's homestead, Nkandla, was justified as it was a listed national key point. In October 2015 South African State Security officials issued a statement to the South African parliament accusing the Right2Know Campaign of being an agent for foreign governments and the US government in particular.

In his first two seasons he showed above-average racing ability, winning two races and being placed at Grade II level but appeared to be some way behind the best horses in Japan. After a lengthy absence he emerged as a top-class racehorse as a four-year-old in 2008, winning the Grade II Copa Republica Argentina before recording a 40/1 upset victory in the Japan Cup. He failed to win in the following year and his racing career was ended by a serious leg injury at the end of the season. He has had early success as a breeding stallion. Background Screen Hero is a chestnut horse with a white star and two white socks standing 15.3½ hands high, bred by the Yoshida family's Shadai Farm. He is one of the best horses sired by the Kentucky-bred stallion Grass Wonder whose wins included the Asahi Hai Futurity Stakes, the Takarazuka Kinen and two runnings of the Arima Kinen. Screen Hero's dam Running Heroine (a daughter of Sunday Silence) finished unplaced in both of her races in 1996. Running Heroine's dam Dyna Actress was a top-class racemare who won the Sprinters Stakes and was the JRA Award for Best Older Filly or Mare in 1987 and 1988. She was descended from the influential French-bred broodmare La Troienne. During his racing career Screen Hero was owned by Teruya Yoshida and was initially trained by Susumu Yano. Racing career=2006 & 2007: early career As a juvenile, Screen Hero ran twice on the dirt in maiden races, finishing fourth over 1600 metres at Tokyo Racecourse and second over 1800 metres at Nakayama Racecourse. Screen Hero raced eleven times and won two races as a three-year-old in 2007. On his seasonal debut he recorded his first victory when he won a maiden over 1800 metres on dirt at Nakayama in January, beating Berg Missile and fourteen others. In February he finished third at Tokyo and then won a minor race over 1600 metres at Nakayama. In March he was switched to turf and moved up in class for the Grade II Fuji TV Spring Stakes and finished fifth behind Flying Apple before competing on dirt for the last time and finishing second over 1800 metres at Nakyama. After being beaten in two races on turf at Tokyo he was moved back into Grade III class for the Radio Nikkei Sho at Fukushima Racecourse on 1 July and produced his best effort to date as he finished second of the sixteen runners behind the New Zealand-bred Roc de Cambes. In his two remaining races of 2007 he ran unplaced in the Grade III Niigata Kinen and finished third to Roc de Cambes in the Grade II St Lite Kinen over 2200 metres at Nakayama on 16 September. His performances had earned him a place in the Kikuka Sho in October but his season was ended by a fracture to his left foreleg. 2008: four-year-old season Screen Hero wins the Copa Republica Argentina After a break of eleven months, Screen Hero returned in the Shikotsuko Tokubetsu over 2600 metres at Sapporo Racecourse on 16 August 2008 and recorded his best win up to that time as he defeated B B Falcon and nine others. In his next two races he finished second to Biennale over 2600 metres at Sapporo in September and was then beaten a nose by Jaguar Mail in the October Stakes over 2400 metres at Tokyo. By late autumn, Susumu Yano had retired and Screen Hero entered the stable of the first-season trainer Yuichi Shikato. On 9 November he was ridden by Masayoshi Ebina when he contested the Copa Republica Argentina, a Grade II handicap race over 2500 metres at Tokyo. The colt recorded his first win at Graded level as he came home one and a half lengths clear of Jaguar Mail with Al Nasrain a neck away in third. Yuichi Shikato, who trained Screen Hero to win the Japan Cup On 30 November Screen Hero contested the 28th running of the Japan Cup in front of a 102,567 crowd at Tokyo and started a 40/1 outsider in a seventeen-runner field. Before the race Shikato commented \\"He's getting better with each race. He knows how to race, so I'm not particularly concerned about the draw. We're challengers here\\". The Tokyo Yushun winner Deep Sky started favourite ahead of the outstanding racemare Vodka. The overseas challenge was provided by the three British runners Papal Bull (King Edward VII Stakes, Princess of Wales's Stakes), Sixties Icon (St Leger) and Purple Moon (Ebor Handicap, runner-up in the Melbourne Cup). The other Japanese runners included Meisho Samson (Satsuki Sho, Tokyo Yushun, Tenno Sho), Oken Bruce Lee (Kikuka Sho), Asakusa Kings (Kikuka Sho) and Matsurida Gogh (Arima Kinen). Ridden by the Italian jockey Mirco Demuro Screen Hero tracked the leaders as the outsider Never Bouchon set a slow pace. Matsurida Gogh took the lead in the straight but Screen Hero produced a powerful late run to take the lead 150 metres from the post. In a blanket finish he won by half a length, three quarters of a length, a head and a neck from Deep Sky, Vodka, Matsurida Gogh and Oken Bruce Lee. After the race Demuro said \\"We had decided to mark Matsurida Gogh as he always gets a nice position. The only thing I had been concerned about was the start, but he broke well and the slow pace meant we could move in and get a good position easily... he is a very competitive horse. When he lines up with other horses, he really battles to stay ahead of them\\". Shikato commented \\"My heart was just pounding until he was over the finish line... With each race he seemed to rise to meet the level of his opponents\\". On his final appearance of the season at Nakayama on 28 December, Screen Hero finished fifth behind the four-year-old filly Daiwa Scarlet in the Arima Kinen. In January 2009, Screen Hero was voted Champion Japanese older male horse at the JRA Awards, taking 167 of 300 votes. 2009: five-year-old season Screen Hero remained in training as a five- year-old but failed to win in five races. In the spring he ran fourth behind Asakusa Kings in the Hanshin Daishoten and then finished down the field behind Meiner Kitz in the 3200 metres Tenno Sho. In the Takarazuka Kinen he started a 20/1 outsider and finished fifth, three lengths behind the winner Dream Journey. After a break of over four months he returned in November for the autumn edition of the Tenno Sho for which he started at odds of 30/1 in an eighteen-runner field. Ridden by Hiroshi Kitamura he produced his best effort of the season as he finished second to the eight-year-old Company with Vodka in third and Oken Bruce Lee, Dream Journey, Matsurida Gogh and Asakusa Kings among the unplaced horses. On his final run of the year, he attempted to repeat his 2008 success in the Japan Cup but finished thirteenth of the eighteen runners behind Vodka. In December it was reported that Screen Hero had sustained a serious leg injury, described as a \\"bowed tendon\\" and would not race for at least nine months. In fact he never raced again and was retired to stud in 2010. Stud record Screen Hero was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion. For the 2015 season he was based at the Lex Stud. His first two crops of foals included Maurice Gold Actor (Arima Kinen) and the Grade III winners Musee Alien and Guanciale.

Located in the village of Bergün/Bravuogn in the Albula valley, south of Chur and north of St. Moritz, at an altitude of approximately above mean sea level, the Kurhaus is a well preserved/restored hotel of the Jugenstil (Art Nouveau) era. History=The optimism of the early years After the construction of a road, following the river downstream to Filisur in 1855-58, the opening of the stunning Albula Railway in 1903 ushered in a second burst of development for Bergün, and an \\"initiative committee\\" started planning for the construction of a hotel in the village. Design was entrusted to the Zurich architect Jost- Franz Huwyler-Boller (1874–1930) who also worked on the Hotel Cresta Palace in Celerina at about the same time. The hotel opened to guests in the Spring of 1906, offering 120 beds in 85 rooms. It was hoped that Bergün's altitude and remote location would make it attractive as an acclimatisation location for guests preparing to stay higher up in the Engadin and as a health resort in its own right, based on the air quality. The hotel was able to advertise luxury features such as central heating, electric lighting, a lift/elevator, a bathroom, a large dining room, several large south-facing terraces, an elegant vestibule and a ladies' room. Entertainment facilities included a bar, a billiards room, a reading and writing room along with a darkened room \\"Dunkelkammer\\". Modern baths and wcs had been delivered by train direct from England and installed by the manufacturer's own technicians. In 1911 the Kurhaus opened for its first winter season, once the firm \\"Oberrauch\\" of Davos had fitted a hot-water distributed central heating system. The winter season lasted till March. During that first winter season a room with two beds cost 7.00 francs, an evening meal 6.00 per person and breakfast 1.50 francs. A winter attraction of the resort, which had already been opened for the 1904/05 season, was a large skating rink in front of the hotel, used for simple skating, for ice-hockey and for curling. The wider development of Bergün/Bravuogn as a tourist destination that had been anticipated in 1906 never materialised: the Kurhaus has remained the only substantial hotel in the village. The spectacular Albula Railway did indeed provide, for the first time, a reliable year-round transport connection towards Chur, but it also enabled the well-heeled to travel directly to higher and better promoted resorts further south in Graubunden, notably St.Moritz and Pontresina, without needing to pause at Bergün/Bravuogn. Despite bitter resistance from some of the canton's conservative elements, the ban on private motor car usage was grudgingly lifted in the mid 1920s, and during the ensuing decades the more prosperous guests for whom the hotel had been designed increasingly used cars, which highlighted the fact that the village had never acquired reliable year- round road links, especially upriver, to the south. The Kurhaus had come on- stream in 1906 with substantial debts, set in one source at an initial level of 73,000 Francs, and revenues never justified the size of the initial investment.Roland Flückiger-Seiler: Kurhaus Bergün, Historisches Hotel des Jahres 2012. Bergün 2012. Austerity years and a move downmarket Following a major fire on the top floor on 9 August 1949 the hotel was closed. A slow reconstruction followed, whereby although the original architecture was for most purposes respected, the flamboyant little tower which had topped off the building in 1906 was not reinstated. However, potential capacity was instead increased as the original line of roof-dormers was replaced with a more substantial fourth floor. The municipality purchased the hotel and refitted it in a less exuberant style before selling it on to the \\"Swiss Association for Family Hostels\\" (\\"Schweizerische Verein für Familienherbergen\\"), which from 1952 operated it as self-catering holiday accommodation for families. A large number of internal partitions were added as the previously large hotel rooms were batched into groups of two or three and reconfigured as 34 holiday apartments, each with its own little kitchen and rented out on a weekly basis. Most of ground floor facilities such as the restaurants, the bar, the reading and writing room and the billiard room were converted into apartments. The principal dining room and cinema were adapted to be used for group presentations and for teaching school classes. A Saving grace was that the original walls and ceilings were not replaced. They were left in place and covered with timber \\"inner\\" skins which in many places had the effect of preserving them, probably in better condition than if they had been left exposed. Nevertheless, during the 50 years from 1952 till 2002 basic building maintenance was neglected. Exposed facades began to crumble and the roof ceased to be entirely water-proof. The new century In 2002 a group of the former regular guests teamed up to form the company \\"Kurhaus Bergün AG\\" and in the same year succeeded in buying the hotel for 1.5 Million Swiss francs. Under the direction of an architect from Sissach called Heini Dalcher the building was lovingly restored over a period of several years. The hotel was in most respects structurally sound, and most the original walls and ceilings were in most places well protected by panels placed over them in the conversion work of the 1950s. A lot of the old furniture was found in the roof loft where it had stood untouched for half a century. Work started on returning the ground floor rooms to their original condition. The 230m² dining room with its original windows and rehabilitated wall coverings and light fittings is described as one of the most precious Jugenstil (Art Nouveau) interiors in Switzerland. In 2010 the bar came back into operation with its original \\"seating booths\\", along with the cinema room. Work has also progressed reinstating and restoring the bedrooms: those on the first, second and third floors now have modern en suite bathrooms, though less expensive rooms on the fourth floor with access to shared shower and wc facilities are still available. The original wall paintings had been covered over with white paint and are initially visible only in small carefully exposed \\"windows\\" in the coating. The old Rattan furnishings are being recreated by a family firm in Viet Nam, using the original specifications. In 2009 the Kurhaus Bergün joined the \\"Swiss-Historic-Hotels\\" marketing co-operative, of which the hotel's director, Christof Steiner, is currently (2015) president.

Design and development The de Monge 7-4 was designed and built to provide aerodynamic information on the three times larger proposed de Monge 72. Each was a twin boom monoplane with a conventional empennage but no fuselage. Instead, the wing between the booms was extended in chord and greatly thickened to provide depth for cockpits. The smaller aircraft had two engines, mounted just within the booms; the de Monge 72 was to have had a third engine on the central wing leading edge. It was designed by Belgian pioneer Louis de Monge. Both the inner and outer sections of the wing were built around two wooden box spars and wooden ribs. The final ribs of the centre-section extended rearwards to the tail as the booms and the outer panels were bolted to them. An open single cockpit for pilot and passenger in side-by-side seats was positioned between the spars. In plan the centre-section was rectangular, about in span, in chord (more than half the overall length of the aircraft) and was thick. The outer panels were braced to the lower centre-section outer edge on each side with two steel tube struts. In plan the outer panels were strongly tapering trapezoids, carrying ailerons along the entire trailing edge. The de Monge 7-4 was powered by two Anzani air-cooled 3-cylinder radial engines on a girder across the leading edge of the centre-section. Since they were both just within the centre-section span, they were less than apart and the propeller disks slightly overlapped; to avoid damage both engines were slightly canted to starboard. The top of the rear ends of the booms were bridged by a near-rectangular plan horizontal tail with a full span elevator. This had a pair of cut-outs for the deep rudders, mounted on near triangular fins; there was another, rudderless fin mounted at the centre of the tailplane. The de Monge 7-4 had a conventional fixed, split- axle, tailskid undercarriage. The axles were hinged from a V-strut, mounted on the centreline and braced with transverse wires, with their outer ends mounted on near-vertical rubber shock absorbing struts and hinged, trailing struts, both to the lower centre-section outer edge. Each boom carried a small tailskid. The exact date of the first flight of the de Monge 7-4 is not known but it was present for the 1923 Coupe de Zenith, piloted by one Brusseaux. However, for unrecorded reasons it failed to depart on the first stage. Its early trials had been flown by Alexis Maneyrol, who was flying a Peyret aircraft at this competition. It competed in the same contest in 1924 but once again was forced to retire. By this time more powerful Anzani engines had been fitted.

First conceived in 1876, it was formed in 1881 and trained by Japanese officers led by Horimoto Reijo, military attaché at the Japanese legation. It received better treatment than the old Korean Army, whose soldiers' salaries were in arrears on account of the costs of the Byeolgigun. This led in 1882 to the Imo mutiny, in which soldiers rioted and Horimoto Reijo was killed. In May 1881, as part of its plan to modernise the country, the Korean government invited the Japanese military attaché, Lieutenant Horimoto Reizō, to serve as an adviser in creating a modern army. From 80 to 100 young men of the aristocracy were to be given Japanese military training and make up the newly formed Special Skills Force. However, there was resentment towards the formation on the part of the soldiers of the regular army who viewed it with envy as the formation was much better equipped and treated than themselves. Also, more than 1,000 soldiers had been discharged in the process of overhauling the army; most were either old or disabled and the rest had not been given their pay in rice for thirteen months.

After various changes, it is now the Pedagogical College of Da Lat (Vietnamese: Trường Cao đẳng Sư phạm Đà Lạt), a teacher's training college. Building The building stands on a plateau. From one side it overlooks the great lake of Dalat, and from the other side looks over the valley where the railway station was built. The French architect Paul Moncet designed the building and supervised its construction. The building was constructed of red bricks imported from Europe. The roof was also made from material imported from France, but has since been restored. The main building is three stories high, with 24 rooms, with a bell tower. The building describes an arc. There are traces of a large clock on the exterior of the bell tower. It has been recognized by the World Association of Architects as one of the 1,000 original buildings of the 20th century. Colonial era Surroundings Ground floor room The hill station of Da Lat had boarding schools that served all of Vietnam. It had been seen as a possible center of government that would be hygienic and segregated between Europeans and Vietnamese. The Petit Lycée de Dalat was created by decree on 16 July 1927, opened on 16 September 1927, and was open for boarders on 7 January 1928. A primary and secondary school, it was restricted to European children. However, the proliferation of the Vietnamese elite in the town made it increasingly impracticable to practice segregation. The Lycée de Dalat, or Grand Lycée, was also founded in 1927, open to French children and the children of the Vietnamese elite. It was a French-style lycée, or secondary school. On 10 May 1935, it took the name Lycée Yersin in honor of Dr. Alexandre Yersin. When the governor-general Jules Brévié visited Da Lat he told a racially mixed set of students at the Lycée Yersin on 12 July 1938, The elite \\"native\\" children were expected to absorb French culture and values, and actively assist in the colonial process. In 1936 the municipal council noted that the students at the Lycee Yersin included young Siamese children. There were growing numbers of children from the elite \\"native\\" families in the 1930s. In 1942 the pupils included the sons of the Cambodian Minister of Finance. The Vietnamese and Cambodian children often achieved the best results. Both Bảo Đại (1913–97) and Norodom Sihanouk (1922–2012) studied at the school. The school and teaching materials were damaged during the Japanese occupation in World War II. It was restored to the extent possible after 1945. A brochure for the Lycée Yersin from 1948 depicted a column of highland people on its cover. The text made no mention of this minority group, whose children were not educated at the school. In 1948 the lycée sent five pupils to the École Polytechnique in Paris, three French, one Vietnamese and one Cambodian. As late as 1950, more French than Vietnamese graduated from the school. In the early 1950s the emperor Bảo Đại granted scholarships so young highlanders, mostly the sons of chiefs or of civil servants, could attend the Lycée Yersin. Later years From 1970 to 1975 the college was named the Hung Vuong Education Center, a training facility for primary school teachers. In 1975 it took the name of Dal Lat Teachers College. Faculties include Natural Sciences, Social Sciences, Exercise / Music / Art, Primary, Preschool, Political theory.

Developed by Blue Byte and published by Ubisoft, the game was released in August 2016. In October, Blue Byte released two expansions; The Alchemist and The Beastmaster, featuring new characters and buildings. The game tells the story of Anteria, a once prosperous kingdom that has fallen into disarray and factionalism. Beset by enemies on all sides, each attempting to gain control of the kingdom, the people of Anteria turn to a group of champions - native Anterians who have recently returned after many years away. The champions agree to help, but soon find themselves in conflict with Kalen Daark, a powerful black mage with his own evil agenda. Originally intended for a 2014 release as the eighth entry in The Settlers series, the game was announced as The Settlers: Kingdoms of Anteria. Championed by Blue Byte and Ubisoft as the most innovative title in the series to date, it was set to feature a mixture of city-building, economic micromangement, real-time strategy, and action-role playing. However, after the closed beta produced predominately negative feedback, especially in terms of how the game didn't \\"feel\\" like a Settlers title, Ubisoft scrapped the project. Nothing more was heard of it until 2016, when it re-emerged as a new property entirely, unrelated to the Settlers series and with a new title. Keeping most of the art assets and maintaining the tone and broad storyline of Kingdoms, Blue Byte had completely reworked the gameplay by removing most of the city-building and economic elements and focusing instead on the action role-playing combat missions. Champions of Anteria received mixed reviews. The graphics, voice acting, and humour were generally praised, and some critics found the integration of city-building and action role-playing well handled. Others, however, criticised the game as being neither one thing nor the other, with both the city-building and the combat lacking sufficient depth. Many critics were also unimpressed with the AI, especially in relation to pathfinding, and there was a general consensus that the combat missions were unacceptably repetitive. Gameplay Champions of Anteria is made up of three main gameplay components - world map, city base, and combat missions. World map The world map is divided into 26 territories, one of which is the player's city base. At the commencement of the game, some of the territories are neutral and some are owned by one of the three factions opposing the player. To complete the game, the player must own every territory on the world map. To defeat an opposing faction permanently, the player must conquer their city base, which is guarded by a boss and can only be accessed after all territories belonging to that particular faction have been captured. Players can only attack territories immediately adjacent to territories they already own, and when an opposing faction attacks the player's territory, the player has one day (in game-time) to prepare before they must play a defensive mission. If the player wins, the attack is repelled, and the player retains the territory. If they lose, the territory will be captured by the opposing faction. The game is not over, however, until an opposing faction captures the player's city base territory. The game is played in 'turns', with the player and all opposing factions allowed to attack one territory per day. Playing a defensive mission also constitutes a turn, meaning the player cannot play both a defensive and an offensive mission on the same day. Enemy factions are fully automated and pursue their own objectives, levelling up their city bases independently of what the player is doing elsewhere on the map. In this way, an enemy faction might attack a player-owned territory, a neutral territory, or a territory owned by one of the other factions. Captured territories can be enhanced by the construction of trading posts and fortifications within each territory. Trading posts increase the amount of gold and renown generated by a given territory each day, whilst fortifications delay an attack by a set amount of time. City base HUD. The border of the current sector is highlighted in white, and this sector already has several buildings. A newly added building (highlighted in white) illustrates the importance of slots – the player can only build in predetermined slots, of which there are a limited number per sector. The player's city base is where the player gathers resources, constructs buildings, researches new technologies, forges weaponry and armour, and mixes potions. The city base generates a certain amount of resources each day, depending on what resource collection buildings and how many of each the player has built. As the game progresses, the player can also build one-off buildings - an apothecary to create potions for healing, enhancing stats, and inflicting damage; a magister machinae to create stationary offensive weaponry and healing zones; a blacksmith to forge new weaponry and armour; and a market to trade resources for gold. The Alchemist expansion added an additional one-off building, the \\"Foundry of Affinities\\", which allows the player to brew five types of new hybrid potions using a combination of resources. To ensure they have enough residents to populate the various buildings, the player must construct residences, whilst to expand their base into additional sectors within the city base territory, the player must build a watchtower within that sector. Watchtowers can only be constructed when the player has access to a \\"brave person\\". However, the only way to attain brave people is by spending a certain amount of renown on the upgrade tree, which is where the player enhances their abilities, unlocks new buildings, and improves the available offers in the apothecary, machinae, and smith. Renown can only be earned by conquering territories, with each territory granting a certain amount of renown per day. The player can level up their city base only by spending renown on the upgrade tree. Levelling up encompasses both the player's castle and every champion in their roster, so players don't need to level up each champion individually. At every second level of upgrade, the player can unlock two new skills for each of their champions. Combat Screenshot showing the combat HUD. On the right of the screen is the mini-map, below which is the objective list, whilst on the bottom left is the elemental affinity wheel. The image also shows the player's four item slots as well as the currently selected champion's action queue at the bottom of the screen. The queue currently contains three actions. In the original game, players could command five champions each with their own elemental alignment and weapon; Vargus wields a broadsword and is skilled with metal, Anslem is a magic-user skilled with lightning, Nusala uses a bow-and- arrow and is skilled with nature, Oona wields dual-swords and is skilled with water, and Baltasar uses a gun and is skilled with fire. The two expansions added two additional champions - Tarn, a brawler skilled with both metal and nature, and Weissle, a mage who can combine any three of the five elements into a hybrid magic. However, each champion also has access to attacks of a different element than their base element - Nusala, for example, can use fire- arrows, whilst Vargus can do a spinning water-based attack. For each combat mission, whether offensive or defensive, the player must pick three champions. Prior to a mission, the player is told the elemental alignment of the majority of that territory's enemies, allowing the player to plan strategically in choosing their champions. The game uses a \\"rock paper scissors\\"-style wheel to determine which element is strong against which other element - fire is strong against metal, metal against nature, nature against lightning, lightning against water, and water against fire. If a champion's alignment is strong against the alignment of an enemy, they will inflict 135% normal damage; on the other hand, if the enemy's alignment is strong against the champion, the champion will inflict only 65% damage. An important gamplay element is \\"Active Pause Mode\\", wherein the player can pause the game, but continue to enter commands, which the champions will carry out when the game is unpaused. It is possible to queue up to four commands per champion. Each champion has 13 learnable skills, but only eight can be learned on a single play-through, as every time the player learns a skill, they lose access to another skill. Of the eight skills, four can be taken into battle at any one time. These skills have various effects, such as stat boosts, extra damage, healing, or temporarily altering the elemental affinities of enemies or allies. The player also has four inventory slots each of which can store a set number of potions and/or weaponry created in the machinae. Plot The game begins as a trio of native Anterians return to their homeland after many years away - Vargus, a former Sergeant-at-Arms in the Crown Legion who became a mercenary for hire when the Legion was disbanded; Anslem, a warrior monk who was cast out of his tribe when he became a vegetarian; and Nusala, a desert warrior who decided she didn't like sand. Finding Anteria overrun with bandits, they head to a nearby town, where they encounter a local named Bryan who asks the trio if they can drive the bandits away. They agree, and the following day, they defeat and imprison Randal. As the champions celebrate, however, Bryan reveals that Randal and his gang weren't really bandits, they were actually guards working for a powerful dark mage named Kalen Daark, who is planning something evil, although Bryan doesn't know what. He explains that various groups are attempting to take control of Anteria and asks the trio if they will help defend the kingdom. With that in mind, he introduces them to General Fidelus, commander of Anteria's army. Again, the champions agree to help. Setting out, they face several foes - the Dune Tribe, a once peaceful people from the deserts to the west, who have recently begun to attack Anteria without explanation; the Frostbeards, a warlike race from the frozen east, once made up of numerous hostile tribes, but who have recently been united under new leadership; and the Broken Crown, the remnants of the Crown Legion, who have been secretly rebuilding their strength in the mountains to the north. Along the way, the trio are joined by four other champions - Oona, known as the \\"Bladestorm\\", she once fought against Vargus, impressing him to such an extent that he invited her to join them; Baltasar, a mercenary for hire with an out- of-control ego who heard of the conflict and assumed the champions would be happy for his help; Weissle, a clumsy but powerful mage; and Tarn, a brawler known for his affinity for animals. Upon venturing into Dune Tribe territory, the champions discover the oases upon which the Tribe depend have become infused with magical poison, and a mysterious djinn has told the Tribe's leader, Queen Nuaba, that the origin of the magic is Anteria, upon whom she declares war. Fighting their way through to her, they best her in combat and release her from the power of the djinn, after which she calls off the offensive against Anteria. Facing off against the Frostbeards, the champions encounter a massive humanoid creature controlled by a small magician. They learn that some time prior, the magician Kenstrid was appointed senior advisor to the king, Bryndt Jodenson. The two then disappeared for several weeks and when they returned, Bryndt had been transformed into the creature; a lumbering brute completely under the control of Kenstrid. The champions fight and defeat the duo, killing Bryndt, who is given an honourable funeral by the Frostbeard clans as they call off their attacks on Anteria. Advancing on the Broken Crown, the champions learn they are led by Fendrel, Vargus's older brother and the man responsible for disbanding the Crown Legion. Attacking his keep, the champions defeat him and the Broken Crown surrender. As the champions and Anterians celebrate, however, they learn that Daark was secretly using the Dune Tribe, Frostbeards, and Broken Legion to distract the champions so they wouldn't notice him manoeuvring his Daark Cult towards his ultimate goal - to end all life; revenge for his banishment from this plane of existence centuries earlier. The champions storm Daark's fortress, but he transports them into the Unliving Dimension where he reveals his true form - a powerful dragon. Nevertheless, the champions are able to defeat him, and back in this reality, just as the Daark Cult gain the upper hand against Fidelus's army, Daark's defeat causes his followers to turn to ash, thus liberating the kingdom. Development=Kingdoms of Anteria The game was originally announced in June 2014, under the title The Settlers: Kingdoms of Anteria, the eight entry in the city-building and real-time strategy franchise, The Settlers. Blue Byte's Director of Product Development, Christopher Schmitz, said of the game, \\"by reinventing our approach to the franchise, The Settlers: Kingdoms of Anteria offers players a brand new experience full of new possibilities to explore. Without a doubt, this is the most innovative Settlers game we have ever created.\\" In August, Ubisoft released the first screenshots and revealed that the game would be a combination of city-building and action role-playing, with the combat sections likened to the Diablo series or a MOBA. At this stage of development, the supply and demand-based city- building gameplay was similar to previous Settlers titles, involving economic micromangement, constructing and upgrading buildings, researching new technologies, and gathering resources, with an emphasis on building up a robust economic model, managing daisy-chain economic processes, navigating technology trees, and improving the player's settlement. An innovation in the basic Settlers gameplay at this time was that when the player constructs a building, it is no longer automatically linked to other buildings or automatically assigned a role. So, for example, when the player builds a lumberjack, nothing will happen until the player manually assigns the occupant a section of forest in which to work. Similarly, when the player builds a sawmill, it doesn't automatically form an economic chain with the lumberjack. Instead, the player must manually link the buildings, with each building capable of being linked with only one other building - so if the player has more than one sawmill and lumberjack, they must choose how to set up the buildings' interactions. This was to be the case for production chains involving two buildings or many buildings - everything must be manually linked by the player, allowing a level of control not yet seen in the franchise. In July 2014, Blue Byte revealed that players would need to remain online while playing; if the network connection is lost, the game will automatically pause until the connection is re-established. This proved to be a controversial announcement, with fans and journalists referring to Ubisoft's disastrous rollout of their 2010 digital rights management system, the Online Services Platform, which rendered The Settlers 7: Paths to a Kingdom unplayable for thousands of players across the globe. In an October interview with PC Games, Guido Schmidt, then lead designer, defended the decision to make the game only playable whilst the player is online; At Gamescom in August, Schmidt revealed that unlike in previous Settlers titles, the player would have only one city, which they develop throughout the game, rather than having to build a new city every level. He also touted the game's economic system, which he stated was the most complex in the franchise's history, with some of the more advanced economic processes involving up to 19 buildings. Discussing the differentiation between combat missions and city-building, Schmidt said the designers were acting on feedback from fans, who disliked being under pressure whilst they tried to build up their city, as that city could be attacked at any time. With this in mind, Blue Byte decided to completely divorce combat from city-building, structuring the combat more in the vein of a dungeon crawler than the kind of real-time strategy combat seen in previous titles. Champions of Anteria The German closed beta began on August 20 and the international beta on September 16. However, by late October, it had become apparent that the beta was generating predominantly negative feedback from both fans and journalists. Many found the combat gameplay too similar to Diablo games, and criticised the repetitiveness of the missions, the necessity for grinding, the high difficulty level, an unclear tutorial, chaotic fights, non-rotatable camera, and poor AI. They were also highly critical of the game's use of real-world money to speed up construction, buy resources, and expand inventory slots, with many opining that the game felt like a free-to- play title, even though it was full price. There was also a strong feeling that the game didn't feel like a Settlers title. In his PC Games interview in October, Schmidt said that based on feedback received during the beta, the combat portions of the game, which originally made up roughly 75% of gameplay would be scaled back to around 50%; players would level up faster, giving them access to more buildings and abilities earlier in a playthrough; the default difficulty level would be lowered; AI would be improved; and the tutorial would be expanded. However, he reiterated that the use of real-world money would not be removed and wait-times for construction and resource collection would not be reduced. In January 2015, Ubisoft abruptly ended the beta several months early. In a statement on the game's official forums, they stated, \\"this step is unusual but necessary so that we can fully concentrate on modifications, new content, and solutions to known problems. Many upcoming changes are based on the huge amount of valuable feedback that has been collected to date.\\" They also promised that there would be \\"information coming in the near future.\\" However, nothing more was heard of the game, and when it wasn't featured at Gamescom in August 2015, many speculated that it may not be released at all. By February 2016, most journalists had concluded that the game had been cancelled, despite no word from either Blue Byte or Ubisoft confirming or denying a cancellation. However, in April 2016, Blue Byte published an open letter on the game's forum and Facebook page explaining that Kingdoms of Anteria would be released in August, albeit no longer as a Settlers title, with the new name of Champions of Anteria, and with redesigned gameplay; They went on to talk about the style of the game and how it differed from titles in The Settlers series; \\"with a renewed focus on story, the economic and logistic features are revised and are handled via a homebase management system where you can craft items for your Champions and unlock new abilities.\\" They also stated, \\"for those who are wondering about the classic Settlers series, rest assured that The Settlers is alive and kicking!\\" With the negative criticism of the closed beta in mind, Blue Byte had restructured the game entirely, all but removing city-building and economic micromanagement, whilst streamlining the game into a single-player only title. Reception Champions of Anteria received \\"mixed or average reviews\\", with a score of 67 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on twenty reviews. IGN.its Francesco Destri scored the game 7.8 out of 10, praising the \\"almost perfect alternation between the action-RPG and the more reflective management-style sections.\\" He also lauded the graphics, voice-acting, and humour. Although he criticised the repetitiveness of the combat missions and the dearth of any degree of stealth gameplay, he concluded, \\"Blue Byte has managed to combine management, RTS and role play à la Diablo in a convincing way.\\" 4playerss Dieter Schmidt scored it 77%, praising the graphics, the integration of action role-playing and city-building, and the use of Active Pause Mode, and calling the game \\"addictive\\". In terms of criticisms, he found the combat missions repetitive and the AI's pathfinding poorly implemented and occasionally buggy. Nevertheless, he concluded that, \\"at its core, Champions of Anteria does a lot of things right, it knows how to entertain, and it evokes memories of Baldur's Gate\\" IGN.ess Jose A. Rodríguez scored it 7.2 out of 10. He praised the comedy elements and voice-acting, but was critical of the graphics, particularly the similarity in the aesthetic design from map to map; \\"even when set on Ultra, we see that the maps are very similar to one another, with elements repeating from map to map.\\" However, although he acknowledged the game wasn't especially original, he enjoyed playing it, concluding, \\"Champions of Anteria manages to bring together various genres and revive the essence of The Settlers. It doesn't try anything new, but it knows how to mix the elements.\\" Eurogamer.its Daniele Cucchiarelli scored it 7 out of 10. He praised the graphics but was critical of the repetition in the combat missions, calling the game \\"an interesting hybrid experiment that can be considered successful, but not completely.\\" PC Games Matti Sandqvist scored it 6 out of 10. He praised the graphics, but was critical of the combat missions' repetitiveness and what he perceived as the redundancy of the rock-paper-scissors elemental alignment system. He was also critical of the limited variety of enemies, the lack of AI tactics, poor AI pathfinding (\\"the champions' insane routes are among the worst I've seen since Command & Conquer\\"), and the implementation of Active Pause Mode (\\"often the champions \\"forget\\" their orders and simply stand still - even if they are attacked)\\". He concluded that \\"due to the many small mistakes, I got the feeling that the developers may have lacked time to optimise the game sufficiently.\\" GameStars Sascha Penzhorn scored it 59 out of 100. Although he lauded the graphics, he was highly critical of the game's repetitiveness, writing, \\"it is unforgivable when missions repeat themselves 1:1 after three or four hours of play.\\" He was also critical of the elemental alignment system, arguing that it \\"doesn't bring any tactical depth.\\" Although he enjoyed the city-building sections of the game, he found they didn't alleviate the boredom of the combat missions, opining, \\"you could completely throw the combat out and make the building sections a decent Settlers title.\\" The Games Machines Daniele Dolce scored it 4.8 out of 10. He too was very critical of the repetitiveness of the combat missions, writing, \\"regardless of the territory attacked, missions with identical objectives always take place in the same way, with the same scenario map and the same enemy positioning.\\" He was also critical of the city-building, finding it \\"so diluted that it has completely lost its effectiveness.\\" He concluded by calling the game \\"boring, repetitive, and strategically irrelevant.\\" Expansions Champions of Anteria received two expansions, both released in October 2016. The first, The Alchemist, introduced a new building (The Foundry of Affinities) for brewing five types of hybrid potions, and a new champion - Weissle the Alchemist, a mage capable of combining any three elements into a multi-elemental spell. The second expansion, The Beastmaster, introduced another new champion - Tarn the Beastmaster, a brawler with both metal and nature alignments.

The Ashland Brewing Company was a small regional brewery, located in the northern Wisconsin city of Ashland. It was founded in 1874 and had an annual capacity of over 12,500 barrels. Ashland Union Brewery The name of the company's facility was the Ashland Union Brewery, and was located on 10th Avenue East, on a plot of land next to Bay City Creek. This was near the site of another beverage business, known as the Ashland Bottling Works. The brewery measured 34 by 70 feet and was two stories high. Initially built of wood, the building was later veneered with bricks on the outside. Next to the brewery was a 24 by 50 foot ice house, due to the unavailability of modern refrigeration at the time. The brewery was owned by brothers Adam and Conrad Goeltz, who emigrated to the US from Germany in 1847. They first moved to Ashland in 1854, subsequently leaving but returning in 1863. The brewery was later owned by Frederick W. Miller, from 1901 to 1937. In addition to owning the brewery, the Goeltz family also owned the Seventh Avenue Hotel, as well as an Ice cream parlor on Seventh Avenue West (which is now known as Chapple Avenue). Products Beer was made available in both glass bottles, as well as kegs. Shipment was available, and the company delivered to all points around Lake Superior, according to an article about the brewery that appeared in the August 8, 1874 edition of the Ashland Press. Some of the products included their flagship brand Ashland Beer, as well as White Ribbon Beer, and New York State Porter and Ale. Advertisements for each of these appeared locally and regionally. The company's logo was a six-pointed star, inside of a circle, with the letter A (for Ashland) inside of the star. The star was known as the Brewer's Star, which was intended to symbolize purity. The six points of the star represented the six aspects of brewing most critical to purity: the water, the hops, the grain, the malt, the yeast, and the brewer. Prohibition During Prohibition, the company produced non-alcoholic beverages, such as soft drinks. Despite surviving the Prohibition era (which ended in 1933), the brewery eventually closed in 1937. Despite closing after prohibition, the company remains a part of Wisconsin's brewing history. While a few other historic beer brands from Northern Wisconsin survived and still exist, such as Rhinelander Beer, Ashland Beer unfortunately remains just a memory.

He was also credited with the founding of the Department of International Relations. He moved to the Diplomatic Academy of the USSR in 1976 and served as a Professor till 1984. Bondarevsky served as an advisor to the Soviet Government, and after its disintegration, the Russian Government on Oriental Affairs till his death. He was a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and served on its Institute of Social-Political Studies as a member. His contributions are reported behind the relief supplies provided to the war victims and their families in the aftermath of the Iraq War of 1991. He owned a 7000 volume library and published 27 books and over 300 articles, covering political topics related to Central and South Asia, Caucasian region, the Persian Gulf, the Near and Middle East. After conferring him with the Jawaharlal Nehru International Award, the Government of India honoured him again, in 2000, with the fourth highest civilian honour of the Padma Shri. Bondarevsky, a member of the Anti-Zionist Committee of the Soviet government, was murdered on 7 August 2003 at his Moscow apartment, death resulting from the injuries sustained from heavy blows to his head. The alleged killer was soon apprehended but was acquitted later, after trial.

Early life Birch hails from the small Eastern Cape town of Dordrecht. He was educated at St Andrew's College in Grahamstown, before further his studies at the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University (NMMU) in Port Elizabeth. His grandfather Ernest Birch played first-class cricket for Border in the 1940s and his elder brother Colin Birch played for Western Province. Playing career Birch represented South Africa at the 2004 Under-19 Cricket World Cup in Bangladesh. He also represented the South African Students team whilst at NMMU. He made his first-class debut for Eastern Province in January 2005 against Griqualand West in the UCB Provincial Cup. A bowling all-rounder, Birch graduated through the Eastern Province ranks to become the leader of the Warriors franchise attack, finishing as the Warriors leading wicket-taker in the 2012/13 and 2014/15 Sunfoil Series. He was also the Warriors leading wicket-taker in the Momentum One Day Cup in the 2012/13, 2013/14 and 2015/16 seasons, finishing as the competitions overall leading wicket taker in the 2012/13 season. During his first innings haul of 4/57 against the Lions at the Wanderers in their fifth round Sunfoil Series clash of the 2016/217 season, Birch claimed his 300th first-class wicket when he had Mangaliso Mosehle caught at second slip by Simon Harmer. The Warriors finished as runners-up in the 2016–2017 CSA T20 Challenge, losing to the Titans in the final. Birch's 17 wickets from nine matches placed him second on the overall leading wicket-takers table, with his 5 for 16 against the Titans on 2 December 2016 being both a personal career best as well as the single best figures in the competition. Birch has also played for the South African 'A' side. In August 2017, he was named in Nelson Mandela Bay Stars' squad for the first season of the T20 Global League. However, in October 2017, Cricket South Africa initially postponed the tournament until November 2018, with it being cancelled soon after. In October 2018, he was named in Tshwane Spartans' squad for the first edition of the Mzansi Super League T20 tournament. Later the same month, he was named in the squad for the Dhaka Dynamites team, following the draft for the 2018–19 Bangladesh Premier League.

Hiskey (May 21, 1929 – July 28, 2016Hiskey, Richard, Published in The News & Observer on July 31, 2016) was an American chemist and Alumni Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Chemistry at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Dr. Hiskey joined the Department of Chemistry of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1958. He served in various capacities within the University including Director of Graduate Studies (1965-1970) and Chairman of the Department (1970-1975), (elected) Chairman of the Division of Natural Sciences from 1975 to 1981, and Faculty Representative to the Atlantic Coast Conference and National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (1985-1995). Academic career He received the Standard Oil Foundation for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching Award in 1970; the Tanner Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching in 1986; and he was elected by students to membership in the Society of the Golden Fleece in 1989. He collaborated with 55 M.S. and Ph.D. colleagues resulting in over 160 referred publications in journals and edited volumes. Following Hiskey's retirement in 1996, the Department created the Richard G. Hiskey Graduate Student Fellowship dedicated to the recruitment and retention of outstanding graduate students. Hiskey received Outstanding Alumnus Awards from Kansas State University in 1973, Wayne State University in 1978, Emporia State University in 1979, and the UNC-CH General Alumni Association Faculty Service Award in 1992. He also was a John Simon Guggenheim Foundation Fellow and a Kenan Research Leave Fellow in 1970-71 at the Max Planck Institute for Cell Chemistry. Hiskey's initial research concerned the development of methods for the production of \\"mixed sulfides\\" and the features which stabilized or destabilized these molecules. Mixed disulfides occur in the folding and stabilization of proteins via cystine-cystine interactions. Pursuit of the synthesis of insulin led to the development of methods for the production of mixed disulfides containing two or more cystine residues differently S-protected. The second major phase of Hiskey's research program concerned the role of protein-bound X-Carboxyglutamic (GLA) residues in blood clot formation. He developed a method for chemical modification of the GLA residues in 1982 and studied it using various metal ims and prothrombin fragments binding to phospholipid surfaces. These studies were recognized in Hiskey's National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's Merit Award for the period 1986 to 1996. The study was extended to include various models containing tris-phosphates and peptides containing several GLA residues. Hiskey's interest in peptide synthesis resulted in membership on the Organization Committee of the American Peptide Symposium from 1978 to 1983, as well as from 1988-1990, and co-chairman of the 1982 Gordon Research Conference on the Chemistry and Biology of Peptides. Hiskey also received and accepted an invitation to visit Japan as a Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Fellow as a result of his work on peptide synthesis. Finally, the American Peptide Society presented Hiskey with the Society's Annual Award in June 1996. In that same year, Hiskey retired from the University of North Carolina as Alumni Distinguished Professor Emeritus. Honors * John Simmon Guggenheim Foundation Fellow, 1970–71RICHARD G.

It is named after Louis Melville Milne-Thomson. Introduction Let z = x + iy and \\\\bar {z}\\\\ = x - iy where x and y are real. Let f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y) be any holomorphic function. Example 1: z^4 = (x^4-6x^2y^2+y^4) +i(4x^3y-4xy^3) Example 2: \\\\exp(iz)=\\\\cos(x)\\\\exp(-y)+i\\\\sin(x)\\\\exp(-y) In his article, Milne-Thomson considers the problem of finding f(z) when 1. u(x,y) and v(x,y) are given, 2. u(x,y) is given and f(z) is real on the real axis, 3. only u(x,y) is given, 4. only v(x,y) is given. He is really interested in problems 3 and 4, but the answers to the easier problems 1 and 2 are needed for proving the answers to problems 3 and 4. 1st problem Problem: u(x,y) and v(x,y) are known; what is f(z)? Answer: f(z)=u(z,0)+iv(z,0) In words: the holomorphic function f(z) can be obtained by putting x = z and y = 0 in u(x,y)+iv(x,y) . Example 1: with u(x,y)=x^4-6x^2y^2+y^4 and v(x,y)=4x^3y-4xy^3 we obtain f(z)=z^4. Example 2: with u(x,y)=\\\\cos(x)\\\\exp(-y) and v(x,y)=\\\\sin(x)\\\\exp(-y) we obtain f(z)=\\\\cos(z)+i\\\\sin(z)=\\\\exp(iz). Proof: From the first pair of definitions x = \\\\frac{z + \\\\bar {z}}{2} and y = \\\\frac{z - \\\\bar {z}}{2i}. Therefore f(z)= u \\\\left( \\\\frac{z + \\\\bar {z}}{2}\\\\ , \\\\frac{z - \\\\bar {z}}{2i}\\\\right) + iv\\\\left( \\\\frac{z + \\\\bar {z}}{2}\\\\ , \\\\frac{z - \\\\bar {z}}{2i}\\\\right) . This is an identity even when x and y are not real, ie. the two variables z and \\\\bar {z}\\\\ may be considered independent. Putting \\\\bar {z} =z we get f(z) = u(z,0) + iv(z,0) . 2nd problem Problem: u(x,y) is known, v(x,y) is unknown, f(x+i0) is real; what is f(z)? Answer: f(z)=u(z,0). Only example 1 applies here: with u(x,y)=x^4-6x^2y^2+y^4 we obtain f(z)=z^4. Proof: \\"f(x+i0) is real\\" means v(x,0)=0. In this case the answer to problem 1 becomes f(z)=u(z,0). 3rd problem Problem: u(x,y) is known, v(x,y) is unknown; what is f(z)? Answer: f(z)=u(z,0)-i \\\\int u_y(z,0) dz (where u_y(x,y) is the partial derivative of u(x,y) with respect to y). Example 1: with u(x,y)=x^4-6x^2y^2+y^4 and u_y(x,y)=-12x^2y+4y^3 we obtain f(z)=z^4+iC with real but undetermined C. Example 2: with u(x,y)=\\\\cos(x)\\\\exp(-y) and u_y(x,y)=-\\\\cos(x)\\\\exp(-y) we obtain f(z)=\\\\cos(z)+i\\\\int\\\\cos(z)dz=\\\\cos(z)+i(\\\\sin(z)+C)=\\\\exp(iz)+iC. Proof: This follows from f(z)=u(z,0)+i \\\\int v_x(z,0) dz and the 2nd Cauchy-Riemann equation u_y(x,y)=-v_x(x,y). 4th problem Problem: u(x,y) is unknown, v(x,y) is known; what is f(z)? Answer: f(z)=\\\\int v_y(z,0)dz+i v(z,0). Example 1: with v(x,y)=4x^3y-4xy^3 and v_y(x,y)=4x^3-12xy^2 we obtain f(z)=\\\\int 4z^3dz+i0=z^4+C with real but undetermined C. Example 2: with v(x,y)=\\\\sin(x)\\\\exp(-y) and v_y(x,y)=-\\\\sin(x)\\\\exp(-y) we obtain f(z)=-\\\\int\\\\sin(z)dz+i\\\\sin(z)=\\\\cos(z)+C+i\\\\sin(z)=\\\\exp(iz)+C. Proof: This follows from f(z)=\\\\int u_x(z,0) dz +i v(z,0) and the 1st Cauchy-Riemann equation u_x(x,y)=v_y(x,y).

Mother of the president of Chile Michelle Bachelet, she was the wife of the Chilean Air Force brigadier general Alberto Bachelet, who died after being tortured during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. Jeria served informally in the role of first lady during the first Bachelet government, accompanying her daughter to several official functions. Her official protocolary role was \\"Director of the Sociocultural Area of the Presidency\\".  Biography = Family and youth  Ángela Jeria beside her husband Alberto and her two children. Born on 22 August 1926 in Talca, Chile, Jeria Gómez was the daughter of Máximo Jeria Johnson and Ángela Gómez Zamora. She was the granddaughter of Máximo Jeria Chacón, the first Chilean agricultural engineer. In 1945 she married Alberto Bachelet in Temuco. They had two children: Alberto (born 13 October 1946) and Verónica Michelle (born 29 September 1951). Jeria worked for several years for the University of Chile, at the Editorial Universitaria (1948–1958) and in the Office of Budget and Finances of the university. After becoming Director of Finances of the university, she decided to study archaeology at the same university in 1969.  Military dictatorship: widowhood and exile  Her husband was secretary of the National Direction of Supply and Commercialisation (DINAC) in the government of Salvador Allende. In 1973, he opposed the military coup d'état. He was detained and tortured by some of his own Air Force comrades. Alberto Bachelet died of a heart attack in 1974, during his imprisonment in the Public Prison of Santiago. Jeria did not have the opportunity to finish her studies in archaeology because she was detained, with her daughter Michelle, and transferred to the centres of the DINA Villa Grimaldi and Cuatro Alamos, where she suffered torture. After being freed and expelled from the country, Jeria lived in exile in Australia, where she began activist work against the military dictatorship of Pinochet, traveling to Mexico, Cuba and the Soviet Union. She also lived in the German Democratic Republic to stay with her daughter Michelle, who was studying medicine at Humboldt University in Berlin, Germany. There she worked as an assistant at a center of prehistory and archaeology. In 1977, Jeria traveled to Washington, D.C. to testify on human rights violations in Chile, following the murder of Orlando Letelier.Fallece Ángela Jeria madre de ex presidenta Michelle Blanchet DiarioUChile Retrieved 3 Juni 2020  Return to Chile and public role  Michelle after her triumph in the presidential primary of the New Majority of 2013. In 1979, Jeria went back to Chile with her family and started to work for human rights organisations. She was detained several times for participating in demonstrations against the military regime. In 1990, she resumed her studies of archaeology at the University of Chile, but abandoned them before graduating. Her granddaughter, Francisca Dávalos Bachelet, followed in her footsteps and studied archaeology at the same university, where she graduated in 2005. In 2006, Jeria's daughter Michelle became the first woman to be elected president of Chile. On 21 November 2007, Jeria was awarded the \\"Medal University Senate\\" for her work at the University of Chile. In October 2009, Jeria publicly supported the presidential candidacy of Eduardo Frei Ruiz- Tagle. In 2013, she supported the second presidential candidacy of her daughter Michelle. Jeria received the prize \\"Monseñor Leonidas Proaño\\" for contributions to the defense of human rights in the region.  Death  On 3 July 2020, the Chilean air force announced that Jeria Gómez had died at the age of 93.

It was the fifth annual Big Ten Football Championship Game and it determined the 2015 champion of the Big Ten Conference. The game featured the Michigan State Spartans, champions of the East Division, and the Iowa Hawkeyes, champions of the West Division. Michigan State defeated Iowa 16–13 to win its second Big Ten Championship in three years. The winner advanced to the four- team championship playoffs. History The 2015 Championship Game was the fifth in the Big Ten's 120-year history, and the second to feature the conference's East and West division alignment. Iowa made its first appearance in the conference championship game, while Michigan State made its third appearance (L in 2011, W in 2013). To date, this game holds the Big Ten Football Championship Game attendance record. Teams=Iowa Iowa came into the Big Ten Championship Game with a 12–0 record and a #4 ranking in the College Football Playoff. The Hawkeyes were led by junior QB C.J. Beathard and 2015 Big Ten Defensive Back of the Year, junior CB Desmond King, who tied the school record and led the Big Ten with 8 INT. The Hawkeyes sat atop the Big Ten West division standings wire-to-wire. They opened conference play with a hard-nosed 10-6 victory over the Wisconsin Badgers in Madison, and overwhelmed the Northwestern Wildcats 40-10 in Evanston two weeks later. Iowa clinched the Big Ten West division by defeating the Purdue Boilermakers 40-20 in the home finale at Kinnick Stadium, and completed an unbeaten regular season by defeating the Nebraska Cornhuskers 28-20 in Lincoln. Head coach Kirk Ferentz was named Big Ten Coach of the Year for the fourth time after guiding Iowa to its first unbeaten regular season in 93 years. Michigan State Michigan State entered the Big Ten Championship Game with an 11–1 record and a #5 ranking in the College Football Playoff. On offense, the Spartans were led by Big Ten QB of the Year Connor Cook and Big Ten Receiver of the Year Aaron Burbridge. In the trenches, Jack Allen and Jack Conklin anchored the offensive line, while Shilique Calhoun and Malik McDowell led an imposing, stingy defensive unit. The Spartans survived a dramatic regular season to capture the Big Ten East division title. On October 17, they scored on the final play of the game (a botched punt attempt) at rival Michigan to win 27-23. Three weeks later, Michigan State lost its only regular season game 39-38 at Nebraska. Then, in a de facto East division title game, the Spartans defeated defending National champion and No. 2 Ohio State in Columbus 17-14, as kicker Michael Geiger drilled a 41-yard field goal as time expired. Game summary=Statistics=Aftermath Michigan State, who had been ranked fifth in the College Football Playoff rankings heading into the game, jumped to third behind Alabama. Alabama beat then-No. 18 Florida 29–15 in the SEC Championship Game on the same day. As a result, Michigan State received a bid to the national semifinal against second-seeded Alabama in the Cotton Bowl Classic.

Biography=Early years Bayard was born to Thomas Francis and Louisa Sewell (Lee) Bayard in Baltimore, Maryland on February 26, 1859. His family lived in Wilmington, Delaware before moving to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1870. By 1885, Bayard was teaching at a school in Fort Pendleton, Garrett County, Maryland. Appointment as Secretary of the Arizona Territory On June 22, 1885, the 26-year old Bayard wrote to United States Secretary of the Interior Lucius Q. C. Lamar asking to be appointed Secretary of New Mexico Territory. A second letter dated September 14 of that same year indicated he would also accept the secretary post in Arizona Territory. Bayard's perseverance paid off and on November 7, 1885, the Maryland resident was appointed Territorial Secretary of Arizona by Democratic President of the United States Grover Cleveland.\\"Arizona Appointments,\\" Arizona Daily Star, Nov. 8, 1885, pg. 1. Bayard thereby became the seventh Secretary of the Arizona Territory, the second-ranking executive position in the government, serving in the administration of fellow Cleveland appointee Governor C. Meyer Zulick. The initial reaction to Bayard's appointment in the Arizona press was hostile. The Arizona Weekly Citizen disapproved of Bayard's appointment, declaring that he lacked the experience needed for the position and that his appointment was only due to his father being the United States Secretary of State. The Arizona Daily Star, published in Tucson, echoed these negative sentiments, opining that Bayard had \\"followed the profession of a dude; then he started out to be a tough, succeeding so well as to be able to kick the glass out of hacks when he was on a spree, and winding up now and then in the police station on charges of disorderly conduct. His next effort was to try to get in jail as a fighter. He had nearly succeeded when he was bundled off to Delaware as a school teacher.\\" Bayard set out for the west shortly after his appointment, arriving in Prescott the night of December 7, 1885.\\"Prescott Clips,\\" Arizona Daily Star, Dec. 8, 1885, pg. 4. The Arizona Daily Star found Bayard in the flesh to be quite unlike the unflattering caricature which had preceded him, indicating that the new Territorial Secretary was \\"a very pleasant appearing gentleman, a little over six feet tall\\" who was \\"of slender build and very courteous and pleasant in his manner.\\" Bayard was sworn in to office on December 9, 1885, and assumed his duties on Thursday, December 10.\\"Local News,\\" Weekly Citizen, December 12, 1885, pg. 4. He would remain at the post for the next fifteen years. Policies and achievements Upon taking office, Bayard learned that his predecessor had failed to leave a file detailing the territory's finances. A second problem revolved around a law requiring all public monies be placed in a U.S depository, the closest of which was in San Francisco. Transfer of funds was accomplished by sending the money by rail to Ash Fork, Arizona Territory and then shipping it to Prescott by stagecoach. Wells Fargo & Company was unwilling to accept the security risk for the transfer, thereby making the territorial secretary responsible for security. Cashing bank drafts in Prescott banks was another option, but the banks charged a 0.5% fee to cash drafts from the federal depository, and there were no legally authorized funds to pay the bank fees.

Brown, Jr. His thesis was titled On Odd Primary Stable Homotopy Theory. He did his postdoctoral training as an L.E. Dickson Instructor at the University Chicago, and then became an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Stanford University in 1980. In 1983, he became an Associate Professor and was promoted to Full Professor in 1987. Cohen is now the Barbara Kimball Browning Professor of Mathematics at Stanford. He was Chair of the Mathematics Department from 1992 to 1995, from 1999 to 2009 he was the Director of the Mathematics Research Center at Stanford, and from 2010 to 2016 was the Senior Associate Dean for the Natural Sciences in the School of Humanities and Sciences. Cohen has been a visiting professor at Princeton University, the University of Oxford, the University of Cambridge, Paris Diderot University, Paris 13 University, the University of Lille, and the University of Copenhagen. He was a founding editor of both the Journal of Topology and Geometry & Topology. Cohen has been the Ph.D. supervisor to over 30 doctoral students, including Ulrike Tillmann and Ernesto Lupercio. Research In 1985, Cohen proved the Immersion Conjecture, which says that each smooth, compact n-manifold has an immersion in Euclidean space of dimension 2 n - \\\\alpha(n), where \\\\alpha(n) is the number of ones in the binary expansion of n. In 1991, Cohen, together with Frederick Cohen, Benjamin Mann, and R. James Milgram gave a complete description of the algebraic topology of the space of rational functions, and in the following years he made several contributions to the study of related moduli spaces. In 1995 Cohen, John D. S. Jones, and Graeme Segal introduced an approach for understanding the homotopy theory underlying Floer homology theory in Symplectic geometry. Since 2002 Cohen has been one of the leading developers and contributors to the theory of String topology, which was introduced originally by Moira Chas and Dennis Sullivan. In 1995, Cohen was a founder of the Stanford University Math Camp (SUMaC), a summer camp for mathematically talented high school students. In 2002 Cohen received the Distinguished Teaching Award from Stanford University, and in 2005 he became a Bass Fellow in Undergraduate Education at Stanford.

It is a sequel to Dead Effect. Gameplay The gameplay mechanics of Dead Effect 2 are similar to the original game. In the default setup, movement is controlled by a virtual joystick on the left of the screen, with sight and aim controlled by the player moving their finger across the touch screen, although there are two shortcut buttons on the left and right of the screen to allow the player to instantly turn 90 degrees to the left or right. Players can use explosives, iron sights, reload, change weapons, shoot and enter slow motion mode using virtual buttons on the right of the screen. Controls can be customized from the main menu, with each icon individually repositionable as the player sees fits. Unlike the original game player character fires automatically when their reticle rests on enemy. In story mode, the player can play as Gunnar Davis, Jane Frey or Kay Rayner. Unlike the first game there is difference in weaponry. Davis is a specialist in heavy weaponry, Jane Frey uses shotgun and Rayner uses melee weapons. Davis features gameplay that is the most similar to the original game. The Steam version of the game was released on May 6, 2016 and features cooperative multiplayer and player versus player. Plot The story follows where the original left off. It is set on the spaceship ESS Meridian after the death of Dr. Wagner, the antagonist in the first game. The player has to fight soldiers sent to the facility. Reception The mobile version of Dead Effect 2 has received positive reviews it holds 78% on Metacritic. The PC version of Dead Effect 2 has a score of 53% on Metacritic. Controversy COGconnected reported that developer BadFly Interactive offered them Dead Effect 2 review codes. The email with codes included a warning: \\"if the review or preview of Dead Effect 2 is very negative, you won't receive any keys from us in the future.\\" This spawned criticism from vmedia towards company. Martin Pospisil from BadFly Interactive admitted that company made a mistake and said that it was caused by experience from some reviews that compared their games with big AAA titles like Left 4 Dead or Mass Effect, which led to very low ratings. He said that BadFly will not blacklist any magazine for negative review if it is fair and honest. Possible sequel In June 2016, BadFly Interactive’s CEO and Creative Director Lubomír Dykast said that BadFly Interactive is working on a game that will take place in the same game universe, although it will not be a direct sequel to Dead Effect 2. The possible sequel's name is revealed to be Tau Ceti. It is a direct sequel to Dead Effect 2. It is expected to launch in 2020.

Pregnancy and birth  Funeral monument of a Roman midwife In ancient Rome, childbirth brought upon high risk to both mother and child due to a greater chance of complications, which included infection, uterine hemorrhage, and the young age of the mothers. Women relied mainly on the religious and superstitious practices associated with medicine at this time. After conception, women would rest in bed to “preserve the seed.”Todman, D. (2007), Childbirth in ancient Rome: From traditional folklore to obstetrics. Australian and New Zealand Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, 47: 82–85. To treat pregnancy symptoms they would eat a bland diet of eggs or rice and would be massaged with olive oil. Plants and herbs such as dittany leaves, scordotis in hydromel and the root of vervain were used for relief during labor. Also, methodologies such as a drink powdered with sow’s dung to relieve labor pains and fumes from hyena loin fat or placing the right foot of a hyena on the woman to induce an easy delivery were of use. The development of midwives greatly improved the birthing process for Roman women. Midwives assisted births in the home and prepared the mothers with oil for lubrication, warm water, sponges, and provided bandages for the newborn. During difficult births tools with sharp hooks would be used to extract the baby. Once the baby was born the midwife would cut the umbilical cord, remove the placenta and then they would decide if the child was worth keeping. Once declared fit to live, as a Roman ritual the midwife would place the child on the ground for the head of the household to then raise up and claim it to rear.  Naming  Infants in ancient Rome were not named until days after they were born (females 8 days, males 9 days) due to a high infant mortality rate. On the 8th or 9th day a gathering would occur consisting of family and friends bearing gifts. Then a sacrifice would be made and the child would be named and given a bulla to identify him or her as freeborn.Rwason, Beryl. Children And Childhood In Roman Italy. Oxford: OUP Oxford, 2003. eBook Academic Collection(EBSCOhost).Web. 7 Nov.2015  Childhood stages  Roman girls playing Romans kept track of the passing of time by celebrating their birthday every year. These celebrations consisted of wine, garlands of flowers, ritual cakes, and fire on the domestic altar. A child who reached its first birthday (the stage known as anniculus) was able to have legal privileges and the parents could apply for full Roman citizenship for their child. From the ages of 5 to 7, children were seen to have more rational minds and were expected to take on responsibility around the home such as taking care of the animals, gathering materials, and general chores around the house. Also during these years, children were considered to be aware of social and sexual roles and children’s groups were organized by gender at that time. The age of 5 was around the end of what was considered to be the infant stage (infantia). At this age Romans knew children were able to understand speech, making them eligible for betrothal. Roman law classified some ages at which a child can have social, moral, or criminal responsibility. Under the age of 14, a child was considered to be doli incapax (incapable of criminal intent). A child older than 10, however, still had the possibility of being held responsible for a criminal act if it could be proven that they understood their offense. Rome's laws did not use imprisonment or the death penalty for the purpose of criminal punishment generally, and the Valerian and Porcian laws exempted all Roman citizens from degrading and shameful forms of punishment, such as whipping, scourging, or crucifixion; but in the case of theft (for example; furtum), the child and his/her family would be punished by being required to return the stolen object, and in some cases two or four times the value of the stolen object. The age of marriage for girls could be as young as 12, and for men, around 25. By the age they reached puberty, boys underwent a ritual transitioning them into manhood. The ceremony involves them removing their bulla and the tunic they wore through childhood and put on a man’s toga while accompanied by their fathers and other relatives. The stages of life the Roman state took note of were birth and coming of age for males, and death. On these days taxes and financial offerings were due.  Relationships  *See Family and Marriage in ancient Rome.  Daily life  Roman boys playing ball games, 2nd century AD Roman children had different clothing from adults until they came of age or were married. Children’s education was normally practiced at home. When children were not being educated their play time consisted of a variety of toys such as rattles, dolls made of cloth, clay, or wax, toy weapons, letter blocks, tops, balls and hoops made of sticks. Dogs were also common pets that children played with. Roman children were not allowed to bathe in the Roman baths, instead, they bathed at home.  Death and burial  Due to disease, epidemics, and high mortality in the Roman world, children experienced death regularly. Children were very much a part of the funeral process with the death of close family. There are no findings that suggest that children were not present during the required purification of the death a family member. They were also allowed to participate in Parentalia in February, which was a time to visit the graves and remember the dead. Because children were memorialized on tombstones it shows that they were recognized as individuals when they died, though they had a better chance of being commemorated after surviving infancy.Bradley, KR. Discovering the Roman Family: Studies in Roman Social History. New York:Oxford University Press, 1991. Print Older children were commemorated in the Roman religious tradition, but babies less than 40 days old were usually buried instead of cremated. They were buried within the city walls, under the house, because they were considered not developed enough to negatively impact Roman religion for not burying them outside the walls. Babies were at very high risk of death and there was no formal mourning period for an infant less than 1 year old. As children got older their mourning period grew longer until they were 10 years old and had the same mourning period as an adult (10 months).

Worrell ultimately chose to major in communications while in his sophomore year at the University of Houston. He had a talent for public speaking, and this became clear in his first on-air broadcasting job with UH campus radio station KUHF. After graduation, he was hired by legendary Houston broadcaster Ray Miller as a news anchor for Houston NBC affiliate KPRC-TV. An avid, lifelong sports fan, Worrell eventually transitioned from hard news into full-time sports broadcasting. In 1974, he became KPRC’s sports director, a position he held until 1980.  Sportscasting career  Worrell left KPRC to take an on-air job with the new cable sports network ESPN in 1980. That year, he began broadcasting Houston Rockets games for local TV on a part-time basis. He stayed with ESPN for three years before joining regional cable network startup Home Sports Entertainment in 1983 as a full-time play-by-play announcer for Rockets telecasts. Since then, Worrell has broadcast most Rockets’ games for local television, a period spanning 35 years. He has called the most notable seasons in franchise history, especially the team's consecutive championship seasons in 1994 and 1995. Currently, Worrell broadcasts Rockets home games on AT&T; Sportsnet alongside color analysts and former Rockets players Clyde Drexler and Matt Bullard. He is widely recognized as the television voice of Houston Rockets basketball. Worrell has also broadcast a variety of other sports, most notably local television broadcasts of Houston Astros baseball. Worrell served as the color analyst for broadcasts of Astros games on Home Sports Entertainment and Fox Sports Net for 20 seasons, from 1985 to 2004. Given his primary role with the Rockets, Worrell covered Astros home telecasts mostly during the NBA off season. In 2005, popular former player and longtime color analyst Larry Dierker rejoined the Astros television broadcast team, a move that effectively ended Worrell's stint as an Astros color analyst. Worrell's departure from Astros telecasts was an amicable one, as it allowed him to focus his efforts on covering Houston Rockets basketball.http://houston.astros.mlb.com/content/printer_friendly/hou/y2005/m02/d24/c949994.jsp Worrell has also broadcast various other sports, including Houston Oilers football, pro rodeo, table tennis, and major sporting events as varied as the Kentucky Derby and the Super Bowl.http://southwest.rootsports.com/meet-the- talent/  Honors and awards  Bill Worrell has received numerous honors and awards for his achievements during his four decades in sports broadcasting. He is a six-time recipient of “Best Sportscast” award given by United Press International, and he won the Lone Star Emmy Award for “Best play-by-play announcer in Texas” in 2011. In 2013, the Houston Press named Worrell the best play-by-play announcer in the city, noting that Worrell's voice has become synonymous with Houston Rockets basketball to several generations of Houston sports fans. The University of Houston honored Worrell as a distinguished alumnus in 2015 and inducted him into its athletics Hall of Honor in 2016.

Founded in 1974, the BAR series is the largest series of academic archaeology in the world, covering all major aspects of academic archaeology worldwide. The BAR Series consists of the International series and the British series. History The founders, Dr Anthony Hands (31/4/34 - 7/8/2013) and David Walker, started the publishing business when, in the late 1960s, they were unable to publish the site reports of their own archaeological dig, Shakenoak Roman Villa in Oxfordshire. The prohibitive cost of printing in Britain at that time, and the lack of specialist publishers willing to publish archaeological site reports, meant that Hands, Walker and their colleague Conant Brodribb ended up self publishing. This involved buying a commercial printing machine and undertaking the full production of their own books. Hands and Walker wanted to include in the BAR series archaeology from areas of the world which had previously been unable to get their research out to an international audience. It was not an easy task to reach the key archaeologists in countries such as Russia, the far eastern USSR, the communist countries of eastern Europe, and Spain under Franco, and involved long slow postal communications in a wide variety of languages. However, the results were effective and for the first time the archaeology of these countries became easily available in the west. The archaeology of the rest of Europe, the Americas, Australia, Asia etc. was also included. The BAR series is published in English, French, German, Italian and Spanish, the five main languages of archaeology. The books are also on occasion published in other languages, with a full English translation. Publication The company that publishes the series, BAR Publishing (trading name of British Archaeological Reports (Oxford) Ltd), is an independent publisher that, from the outset, has been dedicated to academic archaeology and to publishing original work. Until 1989, all BARs were printed by Hands and Walker on their own printer, and collated, stapled and guillotined in- house. In 1991, Tempvs Reparatvm began publishing the series before being replaced by Archaeopress and John and Erica Hedges. By 2015, the Hedges had retired and Archaeopress began concentrating on their own range of imprints.  Reception  Sebastian Rahtz, writing in 1994, states that \\"BAR made an important contribution to archaeological computing in the UK\\", through publishing the Computer Applications in Archaeology conferences.

Its first flight took place in July 2015 and the UAV Model One 100 started full production in January 2016. Its primary usage is in civilian air operations, supporting applications ranging from border protection and security to pipeline monitoring and remote infrastructure management. The aircraft has a fixed wing construction providing extended range and reliability in adverse weather conditions. When compared with a manned helicopter, an unmanned UAV will typically be around half of the operating costs, and can provides a discrete and environmentally friendly approach to air support activities. Operation and Control right The plane is operated from a Ground Control Station with a pilot and a flight operator. It can be manually controlled or run in fully automatic mode, where pre-programmed waypoints allow automatic takeoff, flight and landing. The aircraft also has additional safety modes which allow it to return to base or land in a safe area if communications are lost or faults occur. Of particular interest is the aircraft’s S mode Transponder which allow its flight path to be integrated into normal civilian airspace without special authorization. The equipment and aircraft are all transported in a light van, allowing fast access to small, remote airfields. Communications and Monitoring Secure communications via radio or satellite Inmarsat connections are built in to allow live video and sensor readings to be continuously transmitted back to the ground station. The onboard sensors range include: Infra-Red cameras, Optical cameras, Radar/Lidar sensors and others according to the operator’s requirements. Technical specifications right * Crew: 0 * Wingspan: 4.9 m * Length: 3.7 m * Maximum take-off weight: 100/150 kg * Single piston engine 20/50 hp * Composite construction * Cruise speed: 100 – 150 km/h * Maximum Distance: 1,500 km * Endurance: 10 hours * Payload: 1 – 50 kg * Take-off/Landing length: 300 m Equipment right * Optical cameras * Infra-Red cameras * Lidar * Multispectral/Hyperspectral Camera * On board S Mode Transponder * 12/24V accessory power * Encrypted communications (Radio or Inmarsat) Civilian Applications right UAV’s are widely used in a number of civilian applications. These include: * Precision Agriculture: Real time provision of crop health data and images means farmers can predict crop yields and respond to pest threats rapidly. Up to date information means that application of pesticides will be more precise, economical and less environmentally damaging. * Remote Mapping: Using a 3D laser scanner allows topographic tasks such as remote, complex terrain or groups of buildings to be quickly and safely mapped. * Topographical Mapping for road/rail planning: Efficient preliminary topographic inputs are a core part of planning for road and rail corridors. By using a UAV, areas can be easily re- scanned as frequently as needed without the requirements and approvals needed for on-the-ground logistics. * Mine monitoring and mapping: A UAV can use 3D scanning to provide volume measurements and calculations for mining based on time-interval photography and 3D models * Remote Pipeline monitoring: Ground or sea pipeline systems can be monitored at regular intervals to ensure the safety of the system and the environment. Optical and infra-red cameras can be used, as well as various multispectral and hyperspectral sensors. * Power line Corridor Mapping: Regular 3D scanning of power line corridors is crucial for planning and management. Using a UAV can provide an effective way of delivering this essential service * Disaster Responses and Environmental Management: When mapping the site of a natural disaster, the epicenter of a fire can be easily found using a thermo- camera, so it can be eliminated quickly before it spreads. Real-time remote video can assist in finding missing people in flood zones. At sea, oil spills can be monitored and mapped to inform the best and most effective response. Government Applications UAV’s are used extensively in civilian public sector applications: * Coastal Surveillance: Governments need to monitor their coastal waters reliably, efficiently identifying boats and tracking unknown vessels. By using a UAV with an extended range a permanent remote presence can be maintained. A mid size UAV is unobtrusive and can be deployed across sensitive areas. * Search and Rescue: Using night cameras and advanced thermal sensors mounted on a UAV gives SAR teams an additional set of eyes for supporting rescue operations in forests, coasts and remote areas. * Security: to provide rapid information in critical situations. Real time information from the air allows large crowds or vehicle movements to be monitored, leveraging security forces‘ ability to safely manage complex situations. Long range monitoring provides security forces time to prevent the unauthorized entry of terrorists, criminals or undocumented immigrants. * Border Protection: UAV systems are a key part of modern border protection and surveillance. They provide real-time intelligence on border areas to ground- based teams so that an appropriate response can be made based on live information.

The laws are named for Volero Publilius and Quintus Publilius Philo, the two tribunes responsible for the law's passing.  Lex Publilia (471 BC)  The lex Publilia introduced by the tribune Volero Publilius and passed in 471 BC, gave the power to elect tribunes to the Tribal Assembly rather than the Centuriate Assembly. This law gave plebeians the right to initiate laws. Publilius also saw that the Tribal Assembly should be organized by district, with each district casting a single vote decided by the majority within that district. The four Servian districts were limited to the city (tribus urbanae), and the land conquered after the Servian period was divided into sixteen districts (tribus rusticae). A twenty-first district, called Crustuminian was created in the place that the Plebeians organized themselves in order to have an uneven number of districts and avoid ties.  Lex Publilia (339 BC)  Consul Quintus Publilius Philo is credited with passing three more laws to the benefit on plebeian people in 339 BC, which are as follows: # A law stating that one censor must be a plebeian. # A law limiting the role of the comitia curiata to the ratification of proposals to be submitted to the comitia centuriata. # A law binding all the people of Rome to decisions made by the plebeian assembly. Although there is little to no dispute that Quintus Publilius Philo is responsible for the first two of these laws, the third appears to be a duplicate of a later measure passed in 287-286 BC by Q. Hortensius, and considered by some to possibly be fictitious.

The beginning of a pass is termed acquisition of signal; the end of a pass is termed loss of signal. The point at which a spacecraft comes closest to a ground observer is the time of closest approach. Timing and duration The timing and duration of passes depends on the characteristics of the orbit a satellite occupies, as well as the ground topography and any occulting objects on the ground (such as buildings), or in space (for planetary probes, or for spacecraft using relay satellites). An observer directly on the ground track of the satellite will experience the greatest ground pass duration. Path loss is greatest toward the start and end of a ground pass, as is Doppler shifting for Earth-orbiting satellites. Satellites in geosynchronous orbit may be continuously visible from a single ground station, whereas satellites in low Earth orbit only offer short-duration ground passes (although longer contacts may be made via relay satellite networks such as TDRSS). Satellite constellations, such as those of satellite navigation systems, may be designed so that a minimum subset of the constellation is always visible from any point on the Earth, thereby providing continuous coverage. Prediction and visibility A number of web-based and mobile applications produce predictions of passes for known satellites. In order to be observed with the naked eye, a spacecraft must reflect sunlight towards the observer; thus, naked-eye observations are generally restricted to twilight hours, during which the spacecraft is in sunlight but the observer is not. A satellite flare occurs when sunlight is reflected by flat surfaces on the spacecraft. The International Space Station, the largest artificial satellite of Earth, has a maximum apparent magnitude of –5.9, brighter than the planet Venus.

Speculation of identity  Little is known about the identity of those depicted in the sculpture, but it is known that the type of shoes the middle figure is depicted to wear distinguishes them as a member of the Roman noble class. From this small bit of information, many theories have risen in speculation of the true identity of the center figure, but little evidence has been provided to back up many of these claims and as such they remain only theories. Recent research has suggested that represents a patrician senator, holding the heads of his ancestors.

It was built out of the ruins of the Fort de la Traversette, constructed in 1630 by Savoy. In 1792, during the French Revolutionary Wars, the Savoyards garrisoned the old fort with fifty men. Nonetheless, it fell to the French army in 1794 and was renamed Fort Libre (\\"fort free\\"). The fort became permanently French with the exchange of territory that accompanied the Treaty of Turin in 1860. Between 1892 and 1894, the French constructed new works on the old. In 1897 the fort was unveiled by President Félix Faure and named in honour of the old fort. It was incorporated into the sub-sector of Tarentaise of the fortified sector of Savoy, part of the Alpine Line extension of the Maginot Line in the 1930s. It did not see action until the Italian invasion of France in June 1940. Garrisoned with seventy men plus machine guns commanded by Sous-lieutenant Henry Desserteaux, it withstood the Italian besiegers for four days before the Franco-Italian armistice. On 3 July, eight days after the armistice, the surrendered garrison marched out with the honours of war. In the winter of 1944–45, the fort was used by the Italians and Germans. A garrison of forty-six soldiers defended it against French attacks during the second Battle of the Alps. It was retaken by France on 29 April 1945.Marco Picone Chiodo, In nome della resa: l'Italia nella guerra, 1940–1945 (Mursia, 1990), p. 543.Jean-Louis Riccioli, \\"La deuxième bataille des Alpes : printemps 1945\\", Cahiers de la Méditerranée 52 (1996), pp. 98 and 107.

It is a camelback through truss bridge, built in 1928 by the Berlin Construction Company in the wake of Vermont's devastating 1927 floods. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007 as Bridge 19, at which time it was one of seven surviving camelback bridges in the state. It last underwent a major rehabilitation in 2003-4. Description and history The Brookline- Newfane Bridge is located on the West River, which forms the town line between northeastern Newfane and southwestern Brookline. The road it carries is called Grassy Spring Road (or Town Highway 1) in Brookline and Radway Hill Road (Town Highway 4) in Newfane. The bridge, which is owned jointly by the two towns, is the principal means of access to Brookline from the south, and Grassy Brook Road is the town's principal thoroughfare. It is a camelback through truss iron structure, with a main span of and a total width of . A steel I-beamed approach span of provides access to the bridge on the Brookline side. A bridge has probably stood on this site as early as 1782, when the road linking the two towns was surveyed. It is not known how many bridges have stood there; the bridge destroyed by the 1927 flooding was a Town lattice truss bridge. Following that flooding, temporary bridges were hastily assembled at this site; they were washed away during thaw floods in January 1928. The present bridge was built in spring 1928. The Berlin Construction Company, who built it, was in some ways a successor to the Berlin Iron Bridge Company, having been formed by employees of that company after its acquisition by the American Bridge Company. The bridge was built on older abutments, raising them to a point below the 1927 flood's high water mark.

While performing at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe with his two-man traveling comedy act, The Chris and Paul Show, O'Neill was spotted by a casting director and invited to audition for the role of Elder Cunningham. He joined the first national tour as Elder Cunningham in December 2012, his professional acting debut, and in January 2015 he joined the Broadway cast. In 2019, The Chris and Paul Show competed in the NBC comedy competition television series Bring the Funny, making it to the finals of the show's first season. Early life Christopher John O'Neill grew up in Stamford, Connecticut, the son of Rich and Karen O'Neill. His father is a multi-instrumentalist and Juilliard School- educated pianist, and his mother is a middle school teacher. He also has one brother, Brian. While O'Neill took up music and performed in musicals and plays, he grew up wanting to be a soccer player, and by the end of high school he wanted to be a professional comedian. O'Neill applied to several college theater programs, but owing to a lack of experience, was not accepted into any of them.  The Chris and Paul Show  Starting in 2000, O'Neill and Paul Valenti began collaborating as a sketch-comedy duo called The Chris and Paul Show. O'Neill described the duo's style as \\"stupid and abrupt\\"; it also involved physical comedy. In 2003, shortly after O'Neill graduated high school, the pair moved to New York City, where O'Neill worked a series of retail and service jobs while Valenti found gigs for the duo to perform at. The Chris and Paul Show did receive some acclaim, with O'Neill receiving the Best Actor in a Comedy award from the New York Television Festival and the duo receiving Best Newcomer award at the 2011 Montreal Sketch Festival. They were also nominated for the same award at the 2011 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, which invited them to return in 2012. In 2019, The Chris and Paul Show competed in the NBC comedy competition television series Bring the Funny, making it to the finals of the show's first season. The Book of Mormon While performing at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, O'Neill and Valenti were both spotted by a casting director for the musical The Book of Mormon. The two made it through several auditions in Los Angeles before O'Neill was invited to New York for a month-long training camp and extended audition. Over a dozen other people auditioned for the role of Elder Cunningham at the training camp, including Ben Platt and Cody Strand, who would be chosen to play the role in Chicago and on Broadway, respectively. O'Neill was selected to play Elder Cunningham for the first national tour, replacing original cast member Jared Gertner, who left the national tour for the soon-to-open West End production. He made his debut on December 28, 2012. The performance was also the national tour debut of Mark Evans, who replaced Gavin Creel (who also left for West End) as Elder Price. The role was O'Neill's first in professional musical theater. On January 6, 2015, O'Neill joined the Broadway cast of The Book of Mormon, with Gavin Creel joining the Broadway Cast as Elder Price the same night.

Construction  Santa Rosa was built in 1715 at the Ribeira das Naus shipyard in Lisbon, Portugal for the Portuguese Navy. She was long, had 3 masts and was fitted with 56 to 70 cannons.  Battle of Matapan  On 19 July 1717 Santa Rosa took part in the Battle of Matapan (now Tenaro, Greece) in the Portuguese wing coalition organized by Pope Clement IX against the Turks during the Ottoman–Venetian War (1714–18). After her return to Portugal, she went on different escort missions to fight against pirates. She was also frequently used to protect the yearly fleets to Brazil.  Sinking  On 20 March 1726, A fleet of 18 ships left Portugal for Brazil. Amongst them were 2 warships: HMFMS Santa Rosa and HMFMS Nossa Senhora da Nazaré. Santa Rosa, the mightiest ship in colonial Portugal´s fleet under the command of Captain Bartolomeu Freire de Araújo, was assigned to escort the Portuguese fleet bringing the wealth of the New World back to Portugal. The fleet reached Salvador, Brazil, after 2 months and 4 days at sea on 24 May 1726.http://3decks.pbworks.com/w/page/915358/HMFMS%20Santa%20Rosa In the two and a half following months, Santa Rosa was involved in a lot of loading and unloading procedures. Amongst the cargo spread over the 2 warships were 27,000 rolls of tobacco, 13,000 boxes of sugar, 20,000 hides, thousands of coconuts, a large number of logs, some 10 tons of gold in bullion and coins, diamonds and gems, between 70 and 200 barrels of gunpowder and a regiment of Portuguese soldiers along with other passengers. The fleet was reassembled and left the Brazilian port of Salvador on 24 August 1726, exactly 3 months after their arrival. The following day, on 25 August 1726, a strong storm hit the fleet and forced the fleet to separate into two different groups. The storm held on for several days before dying down; after the storm Santa Rosa escorted a group of ships to return to the original route. Two weeks after they had left Salvador, Brazil, on 6 September 1726. Just as the ship passed Recife, Brazil, the gunpowder in its hold blew up and the ship sank, killing all but seven of the 700 men, women and children aboard. The seven survivors (who were all male) clamped on to the ship's wreckage and were rescued the following day; it is believed more people survived the explosion but perished when they were overcome by fatigue or by injury of shark attacks. The rest of the fleet reached Lisbon, Portugal, on 17 November 1726, but of the seven rescued men only three survived the trip. Even to this day it is unknown how the gunpowder exploded. But some theories have been put forward. The most believed theory is that Captain Bartolomeu Freire de Araújo had been having some heated discussions with the commander of the Portuguese regiment that were on board the ship. After the discussion someone of the regiment went down to the ship's magazine, where all the gunpowder was held, only to light a fire and explode the magazine. There were 70 fire hydrants on board, which means the magazine must have had between 70 and 200 barrels of gunpowder at the time.

Part of the forts of Metz, it had its baptism of fire in late 1944 during the Battle of Metz.  History  Fort Saint-Privat is part of Metz' first fortified belt, designed during the Second French Empire by Napoléon III. The belt consists of Fort Saint-Privat (1870), Fort de Queuleu (1867), Fort des Bordes (1870), Fort de Saint-Julien (1867), Fort Gambetta, Fort Déroulède, Fort Decaen, Fort de Plappeville (1867) and the St. Quentin fortifications (1867). Most of the forts were unfinished in 1870, when the Franco-Prussian War began. Under German control, Metz initially had a German garrison of 15,000 to 20,000 men,. exceeded 25,000 before World War I. and gradually became the premier stronghold of the German Reich.François Roth, \\"Metz annexée à l’Empire allemand\\", in François-Yves Le Moigne, Histoire de Metz, Toulouse, Privat, 1986, p.350.  Construction and facilities  The fort, built by German engineers from 1872 to 1875, was designed in a style similar to the \\"detached fort\\" concept developed by Hans Alexis von Biehler in Germany. The goal was to form an enclosure around Metz of forts and artillery, with a variety of guns and spaces between them.  Assignments  In 1890, the forts were staffed by German Corps XVI troops from Metz and Thionville. The 145th King's Infantry Regiment (6th Lorrain) garrisoned the fort before 1914. Invested by the French army in 1919, the Prinz August von Württemberg Fort was renamed Fort Saint-Privat. It was soon encompassed by the perimeter of the Metz-Frescaty Air Base, which was developed after World War I. The fort was captured in 1940 by the Wehrmacht, which held it until 1944. It is no longer in use.  Second World War  On September 2, 1944, Metz was declared a Reich fortress by Adolf Hitler. The fortress was to be defended to the last by German troops, whose leaders had sworn allegiance to Hitler.. Faced with the 5th American Division, the German 462nd Infantry Division defended the Reich. When fighting began in September, its defense was commanded by Waffen-SS Colonel Ernst Kemper. During the Battle of Metz, several units succeeded each other in the fort. On November 9, 1944 (before to the attack on Metz) the United States Air Force sent 1,299 heavy bombers, B-17s and B-24s, dumping 3,753 tons of bombs and 1,000 to 2,000 pounds of ammunition on fortifications and strategic points in the combat zone of the US Third Army.. Most of the bombers dropped their payloads blind from over 20,000 feet, and military targets were often missed. In Metz 689 loads of bombs hit the seven forts identified as priority targets, causing collateral damage and demonstrating the practical inadequacy of massively bombing military targets.. The final attack arrived from the south and west on November 16, 1944. Facing the 11th Infantry Regiment of the 5th Infantry Division, the 462nd Infantry Division resisted with German MG 34 and MG 42 machine guns. Troops commanded by Lieutenant General Heinrich Kittel defended the airfield's hangars and air raid shelters before falling back towards Fort Saint-Privat and the last hangars. During the cold, wet night of November 16, 1944, the 11th Infantry regiment lost four officers and 118 men on the ground;. German losses were also heavy. Fighting resumed northeast of the base (where a German section clung to the last buildings) the following day, with shots fired primarily from Fort Saint-Privat. The fort was commanded by Werner Matzdorff (1912–2010), a Waffen-SS Sturmbannführer and a Schutzpolizei major. Matzdorff commanded his troops with an iron fist, knowing that he could not hold out for long. Entrenched in the fort, he refused to surrender. On November 20, Matzdorff emerged from the fort with a white flag. The 11th Infantry commander thought that he was surrendering, but Matzdorff said that he and his men were ready to fight to the death \\"if necessary\\" and only wanted to evacuate twenty of his most severely-wounded men.. On November 21, General Kittel (who was wounded in the Riberpray barrack) was captured, and Metz was liberated at 14:35 the following day. That evening, the troops at Fort Saint-Privat began surrendering to the Americans. Although morale in the fort was low, resistance was fierce. After a week the situation became critical, with shortages of food and ammunition. On November 29, Matzdorff agreed to surrender unconditionally with 22 officers and 488 men (80 of whom were wounded and without care for over a week).. The swastika no longer flew over the air base.\\"The man can fall, the flag never\\": inscription in gothic letters framed by the SS runes\\" Treue \\"left and\\" Wolfangel \\"right. in .

It was designed by Queensland Colonial Architect John James Clark and built from 1887 by Robert Taylor. It is also known as Maryborough General Hospital. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 2 February 1998.  History  The current site of the Maryborough Hospital, which is the fourth hospital site, was established in 1887 when a complex of brick buildings was constructed to the design of Queensland Colonial Architect John James Clark. The hospital site has experienced many phases of development, most obviously in the late 1920s, the late 1930s and in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Many of the individual buildings, dating from both the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, are of cultural heritage significance. The original township of Maryborough was situated, not in its current place, but on the north of the Mary River, after wharves were established in 1847-8 providing transport for wool from sheep stations on the Burnett River. In 1850 Surveyor, Hugh Roland Labatt arrived in Maryborough with instructions to \\"examine the River Mary...to suggest ...the best site or sites for the laying out of the town, having regard to the convenience of shipping on one hand and internal communication on the other...also...point out the spots desirable as reserves for public building, church, quay and for places for public recreation.\\" The site recommended by Labatt was not where settlement was established but further east and from the early 1850s this is where the growing town developed. In 1854 a hospital had been established in Maryborough in Fort Street, and prior to this the sick and invalided were treated at home by a few medical practitioners who lived in the town. By 1859 a Committee of Management had established another hospital, near the new centre of the town, at the corner of Ferry and Albert Streets, but was moved in 1863 to a site on the corner of Lennox and Walker Streets. In 1864 the hospital moved to its first purpose built building in Lennox Street, near the corner of Sussex Street. A substantial two storeyed brick building was constructed and a wing was added to this in 1865. In 1876 further additions were made to this site. By the mid 1880s, the Lennox Street site was considered inadequate and another site on a large block in Walker Street on elevated ground on the western outskirts of the town was set aside for hospital use. This was officially reserved as a Hospital Reserve after the hospital was constructed, on 4 October 1888 and Henry Palmer, Henry Walker and William Southerden were appointed as trustees.  Centre Block and C-Block  Maryborough Base Hospital, circa 1910 The first complex constructed on the new hospital site comprised three brick buildings, a central administrative core flanked by wards, as well as a separate medical superintendent's residence and a palisade fence with gates along Walker Street. These were designed by colonial architect JJ Clark and based on contemporary principles of hospital design about the pavilion plan. For about eighty years, from the 1860s, all wards in hospitals built in Queensland were based on the principles of the pavilion plan which emerged as a development of hospital design in Europe in the 1850s. Pavilion planning was seen to overcome problems of good ventilation and sanitation. From the nineteenth century credence was given to the idea that disease was spread by foul air, according to miasmatic theory. The first pavilion plan was used in the design of the Lariboisière Hospital in Paris, which was a series of detached pavilions, where increased ventilation assisted patients in ridding themselves of their illness. This was a breakthrough in hospital design, because for the first time the building form was considered a crucial element of the healing process. By the 1870s and 1880s many pavilion plan type hospital wards were being constructed in major hospitals through Queensland. Two of the nineteenth century buildings extant at the Maryborough Hospital, namely C-Block and Centre Block, are remnants of a pavilion planned hospital. The original 1887 complex comprised three buildings, a central administrative core flanked by two storeyed pavilion wards, those to the east for women and those to the west for men. Of these buildings only sections of the administrative core, Centre Block, and the men's wards, C Block, remain. The Centre Block housed offices and consulting rooms on the ground floor and residential quarters on the first floor. Early photographs of the hospital showing these three buildings clearly manifest the ideals of pavilion planning; with three distinct and separated structures surrounded by verandahs. Of about eighty pavilion planned wards constructed in Queensland during the nineteenth century only six remain, three of these are at the Royal Brisbane Hospital, one at Isisford and one at Ipswich. The foundation stone of the buildings was laid by the Queensland Premier, Sir Samuel Griffith on 15 April 1885, by which time much of the land had been cleared and trees planted. As well gates and fence rails were ordered from local founders, Walkers Ltd. The architect of the project John James Clark, was at that time the Colonial Architect a position he retained from 1883 until 1885. Though this was a limited period of employment Clark is a well regarded architect as the designer of many important Queensland buildings, includingthe Treasury Building in Brisbane; court houses in Mackay, Rockhampton, Warwick and Charters Towers as well as the Yungaba Immigration Depot in Brisbane. Clark designed many health related buildings throughout the state including hospitals at Charleville and Geraldton; additions to Townsville Hospital, the Baillie Henderson Hospital in Toowoomba, and the Lady Norman Wing at the Brisbane Children's Hospital. The Maryborough Hospital buildings, comprising the hospital complex, residence and fence and gates, were opened on 20 May 1887. The total cost of the complex was about to which substantial donations had been made by local benefactors and the Committee's General Fund with the remainder coming from the government. The contractor for the work was Robert Taylor. In the late 1880s a separate ward for Pacific Islanders was constructed on the Maryborough Hospital site. The Hospitals Act (1923) introduced many changes to the practice of health care provision in Queensland, resulting in the state government providing more funding to hospitals, bringing about the current system of health care as a responsibility of the state. The Act allowed for the creation of districts, each with a hospital board responsible for fundraising and management issues. Shortfalls in funding were met by state and local governments. In the decade following the introduction of the Act, the idea of the \\"modern hospital\\" emerged as a departure from the pavilion planned hospital. The modern hospital was focussed on cleanliness and efficiency influenced by the new germ theory of disease. These values were achieved within the framework provided by a new, modern architecture and characterised by multi levelled high rise structures incorporating new, building and health technology. The Act of 1923 was amended in 1944 and, among other changes to the health care system, introduced the concept of base hospitals. Within each region of the state a base hospital was established to offer more specialised services than other hospitals in the region. It was in this way that the name of the Maryborough Hospital was changed to become the Maryborough Base Hospital. During the 1930s the Hospital Board appointed local architect, POE Hawkes to the position of Board Architect and he designed the buildings constructed in the 1938 redevelopment of the grounds. Much of the construction work designed by Hawkes was supervised by EH Boden.  Former Lady Musgrave Maternity Hospital  This was constructed in 1928 and took its name from an earlier maternity hospital constructed near the town centre to the design of local architect Samuel Bragg. Before the Maternity Act (1922) lying-in hospitals were run by charitable or religious institutes to provide services for women unable to pay for private pre-natal care. The institutions were named after the wife of the incumbent governor. The Act of 1922 changed the nature of maternity care in Queensland, providing free maternity hospitals and baby clinics throughout the state to engender an increase in population particularly in outback areas. Implementation began immediately and resulted in the construction of about 94 maternity hospitals or wards throughout the state before 1930. As part of this program a maternity ward, the Lady Musgrave block was constructed in the grounds of the Maryborough Hospital. The building replaced an earlier 1888 lying-in hospital, from where the later buildings got their names. This 1888 building was constructed at the corner of John and North Streets in central Maryborough and was funded by a local fund raising committee. This earlier maternity hospital was opened on 8 November 1888. The 1928 maternity ward, which replaced this earlier nineteenth century building, was a reinforced concrete building designed by prominent and innovative local architect POE Hawkes. Many of the state's maternity wards were constructed to a standard plan, based on pavilion planning principles with surrounding verandahs and all beds in the ward located near on operable opening. Attached to the rear of the wards by an open verandah or covered walk way was a septic ward. The plan of the Maryborough maternity ward was longer than the standard plan accommodating twenty five beds, nine private wards, matron's office, doctor's room, kitchenette, two labour wards, septic wards, sterilising room and matron's quarters. The building incorporated many features standard to 1920s maternity hospitals including a septic ward separated by verandahs. The Lady Musgrave Maternity Ward was opened on 24 November 1928 to co-incide with the opening of nurses' quarters. On 31 July 1965, a new Lady Musgrave Maternity Ward was opened on land to the north of North Street, acquired by the hospital for the planning of this new wing. North Street was closed through the hospital grounds meaning that the 1928 maternity hospital, which was retained for future use as a disabled children's ward, no longer addressed a street, but faced the rear of the new maternity wing. Mr Douglas Tooth, the Minister for Health, opened the building which cost and was designed by the Public Works Department.  The Nurses' Quarters  Two substantial two storeyed buildings were constructed on the Maryborough hospital site as accommodation for nurses. The first, facing Walker Street, was constructed in 1928, but after only ten years was converted to private wards and another nurses' quarters was constructed facing Yaralla Street. Following the introduction of the Hospital Nurses Award in 1921 basic rates were introduced for nursing staff stipulating wages, hours of work, and, importantly that all staff were entitled to free board and lodging in, if possible, separate rooms or suitable cubicles. The result of the award was the upgrading of accommodation for nurses and also an increase in the number of nurses employed at each hospital. Between 1924 and 1930, twenty six new nurses' quarters were constructed throughout Queensland. The first nurses' quarters constructed at the Hospital, was a two storeyed reinforced concrete building providing accommodation for 78 nurses and domestic staff. The building was opened on 24 November 1928, along with the Lady Musgrave Maternity Hospital and both of the buildings were designed by Maryborough architect, POE Hawkes. This building served as a nurses' quarters for only ten years when a new nurses' quarters was constructed and the earlier building was converted to private wards. When opened, the private wards were known as the Demaine Block, named after the incumbent Mayor of Maryborough, Mr William H Demaine who was also the chairman of the hospital board. The conversion of the building resulted in the opening of 35 private wards and to augment this an operating theatre and doctor's residence were constructed. The total building costs, including the construction of a new nurses' block, was and the construction work was completed by Constructions Pty Ltd of Brisbane. The 1938 nurses' quarters, constructed facing Yaralla Street were similar in design to the 1928 quarters, and was also designed by local architect, POE Hawkes, although it was supervised by another architect, EH Boden and he may have contributed to the final design. Provision was made for 100 bedrooms with an internal arrangement similar to the earlier buildings comprising central hallways from which the bedrooms were accessed, and front and rear verandahs to which nearly all of the internal rooms have access.  20th Century Residences  There are a number of twentieth century residences on the Maryborough hospital site including a two storeyed building facing Walker Street, a brick duplex facing Yaralla Street, and a reinforced concrete building at the corner of Walker and Yaralla Streets. Medical residence became popular during the inter-war period when various schemes were introduced to house medical officers on site. During the first 1928 phase of development a doctor's house was constructed at the corner of Walker and Yaralla Streets. Designed by POE Hawkes, this building is of reinforced concrete and has wide surrounding timber framed verandahs. This building was intended to replace nineteenth century residence which was partially demolished as a result of the nearby construction of the first nurses' quarters, now the Demaine Block. The new residence was constructed for under after the Board asked the Public Works Department to revise their scheme which was to cost considerably more. An inspection of the early plan of the building indicates that the building was carefully designed to ensure passive temperature control. After ten years, in 1938 another doctor's residence was constructed on Walker Street also to the design of local architect, POE Hawkes. Also a reinforced concrete building, this was designed to be an imposing feature and is vaguely Mediterranean in its design inspiration, with an arcaded loggia of three smooth faced arched openings forming a central entrance porch to the building. The living quarters were on the ground floor and the sleeping accommodation is above. A newspaper reports that the external walls were to be finished in the \\"traventene style, whilst white plaster boards are being used on the inner walls and ceilings.\\" In 1950 another residence was constructed, facing Yaralla Street and designed by architects, Prangley and Tesch. The building was designed as a symmetrically arranged one storeyed duplex as quarters for medical staff.  Other Buildings  During the first major redevelopment of the hospital, when the new Lady Musgrave hospital and the first nurses' quarters were constructed in 1928, other new buildings on the site included a mortuary also designed by POE Hawkes which is used as such to this day. This is a small reinforced concrete building rendered with roughcast stucco. At the time of the development the curator of the Gardens, Mr Fred Lawrence, as engaged to lay out the grounds. The next phases of development, opened in 1938 resulted in the construction of a dedicated operating theatre, which was until this stage, housed in various other buildings on the site. The operating theatre was designed by POE Hawkes and is obviously influenced by Spanish Mission architecture which was a popular inter-war architectural style. The building was constructed adjacent to the western side of the newly opened Demaine Block. The design of the operating theatre was described in the local newspaper at the time of opening \\"as the most up to date in Australia\\" and influenced by a \\"famous hospital in Berlin\\". A lengthy report of the innovative fittings and finishes follows and this describes many features which are standard in operating theatres of today. The operating theatre was extended in the 1950s and again in the 1970s and was converted for use as a store when the new major blocks were constructed. In 1950 a dining room, designed by Brisbane architects, Donoghue, Cusick and Edwards was constructed and this was a single storeyed timber building elevated on stumps. The building is now used as a School of Nursing. In conjunction with the construction of the dining room the same architects designed a brick kitchen constructed by the Queensland Building and Engineering Company. In November 1997 these buildings were substantially intact. In the year following, 1951, an ambulance station was constructed on the Maryborough Hospital site. This was built facing Neptune Street for a cost of and housed four ambulance station bays and ancillary room. This is now used as an engineers' workshop. In 1953 the first section of what is now the largest building on the site was constructed. Always intended to be extended, this section of the building formed the ground floor level of what is now B block, on the corner of Walker and Neptune Streets. An official opening of the building was held on 14 November 1953 by the Minister for Health and Home Affairs, Mr WM Moore, which was intended as the outpatients and administrative wing of the hospital. Cabinet had decided on a building programme for the site and approval was given in June 1948 for the acceptance of a tender from Queensland Building and Engineering Co for , although the cost of the buildings was and the construction of a dining room and kitchen was the first part of this building programme. The building was extended in 1977 and opened by Dr Llewellyn Edwards on 23 April 1877 and again extended in 1987.  Description  The Maryborough Hospital site is located to the west of the town centre on a large site bordered by Walker, Neptune and Yaralla Streets and Winston Noble Drive. The site was originally bisected by a continuation of North Street, parallel to Walker Street, but this was closed to traffic in the 1960s. The site comprises a large number of buildings of varying ages and this description will list them in chronological order. There is little overall planning of the site evident, although individual buildings are surrounded by landscaped areas which address street frontage and provide context. There are a large number of significant trees on the site, as well as circular entrance drives, bedding and other landscape features which are important to the site. A small timber framed bus shelter with hipped roof is on the Walker Street boundary of the property, adjacent to the original entrance gates.  1887 former Ward and Centre Block (now C Block and Centre Block)  Architectural Plan of the Maryborough Base Hospital, 1888 Two of the three nineteenth century buildings on the site, C Block and Centre Block are now substantially disguised by later accretions, although many of these additions could be removed to reveal the form of the original buildings. The buildings, which are now linked to one another by a covered walkway, were two storeyed brick structures surrounded by open verandahs. C Block, one of the original ward blocks, is not immediately recognisable as a nineteenth century building, as the two storeyed verandahs surrounding the building have been infilled with a s brick envelope through which aluminium framed openings are punched. The complex hipped roof of the original structure is evident above these verandahs and this retains an early corrugated iron cladding. Internally the building has been renovated but retains many interesting features including an early stair hall and an open ward on the first floor. This ward, which has plaster rendered walls and a raked timber boarded ceiling, is an example of nineteenth century pavilion planning. Centre Block, like C Block is a two storeyed face brick building, with most of its verandahs infilled. The original corrugated iron clad pyramidal roof and verandah awnings are evident. Internally the building retains an early ground floor layout, with several rooms featuring nineteenth century timber joinery, fireplaces and openings. The early entrance to this block is a large double timber and glazed door surmounted by a round arched fanlight and all surrounded with aligned glazed openings and although some of the glazing has been replaced, this doorway survives substantially intact.  1887 former Residence (now Information Technology Building)  When the original nurses' quarters were constructed in 1928 the original doctor's residence was partially demolished. However, what remains of this single storeyed brick building is legible as a nineteenth century residence. The building is raised on concrete stumps and foundations and is surrounded at the eastern end by a timber framed verandah which follows the apsidal plan form of this end of the building. The complex hipped roof is clad with corrugated iron. The building has original openings and joinery.  1887 Gateway  Located in a central position on the Walker street boundary of the hospital site are four substantial rendered masonry gate posts with cast iron palisade gate. The central two gate posts are larger than the flanking posts and all feature steeply pitched double gabled cap. The faces of the central posts have trefoiled lancet-type recesses and this motif is repeated on the smaller posts with circular recesses housing trefoils. The corner edges of the posts are chamfered and the posts have enlarged bases.  1928 Nurses' Quarters (now Demaine Block)  The Demaine Block is prominently sited, facing Walker Street and between the street boundary and the building has a large circular drive around a small traffic island planted with an established poinciana tree. The symmetrically arranged building is a large two storeyed reinforced concrete structure comprising a long central wing, parallel to Walker Street, flanked by transverse wings. Lining the front and the rear of the block are two storeyed timber framed verandahs. The verandahs are housed under the corrugated iron clad hipped roof of the building and have a vertical timber battened balustrade. A centrally located simple concrete stair with timber balustrade provides access to the ground floor level of the building. Other, more recent stairs have been added to the internal corners of the building, although a straight timber stair survives on the rear elevation. The entrance stair sits within a projection on the front facade of the building and this is reflected by a large gabled projection in the roof. Although some openings remain, many of the original openings have been infilled and replaced. The building has been internally refurbished although the original floorplan survives in sections.  1928 former Lady Musgrave Maternity Ward  This building which is now in the middle of the hospital site, originally faced the extension of North Street which was closed in the 1960s. The original maternity ward is a long one storeyed reinforced concrete building surrounded by an infilled timber framed verandah. The corrugated iron clad hipped roof extends over the early verandahs space, making it quite steeply pitched. Three small projections from the south eastern facade which would originally have been the rear elevation, house individual rooms and these are roofed with hipped projections from the principal roof. Adjoining the building at the western end is a small separately hipped roofed building. The other end of the former maternity ward is linked by a short semi enclosed walkway to a separate hipped roof structure. This small reinforced concrete structure, which was always intended as part of the larger maternity complex, is also surrounded by infilled verandahs, and the interior is substantially intact, with original internal partitioning, openings, ceilings and other joinery.  1928 Morgue  This small one storeyed reinforced concrete building is still in use as the hospital morgue. The building contains two adjoining sections, forming a T-shaped plan, with corrugated iron hipped roof and a centrally located roof ventilator. The building is rendered with rough cast stucco and, originally on the now closed North Street boundary of the site, is centrally located east of the maternity wing. The building comprises a viewing room, mortuary, post- mortem room and small waiting room.  1928 Medical Superintendent's Residence  This one storeyed reinforced concrete building has timber framed verandahs and external timber cladding on some sections. The residence is diagonally sited to address the corner of Walker and Yaralla Streets. The hipped roof of the building is clad with corrugated iron sheeting. When completed the building comprised three bedrooms, drawing room, dining room, study, kitchen, laundry and maid's room and remains substantially intact.  1938 Nurses' Quarters  1938 Nurses quarters, seen from Yaralla Street, 2009 This building, which faces Yaralla Street, is similar to the original nurses' quarters, now known as the Demaine Block and is a two storeyed reinforced concrete building. Like the Demaine Block, the nurses' quarters has a large circular drive between it and the street. The building comprises a long central bay, parallel to Yaralla Street and flanked at the two ends by transverse bays which project both into the front and rear elevations, resulting in a H-shaped plan. The building has a hipped roof which extends to provide cover for the two storeyed verandahs which line the front and rear elevations of the building. The timber framed verandahs have similarly detailed balustrade and frieze panelling to that found on the Demaine Block. Likewise a similar centrally projecting section, houses the entrance and is reflected on the roof with a large gabled projection. The ground floor of this projection is lined with heavy rendered masonry, half and three quarter height, piers and this face has now been infilled with glazed louvres. The building is substantially intact with original openings, joinery, floorplan and entrances. At the rear of the building is an iron framed and corrugated iron clad structure with a gabled roof and lined with timber framed window openings. This is thought to have been constructed for military purposes during World War Two.  1938 former Residence now Staff Quarters  This residence is an imposing two storeyed, rough cast rendered, brick building facing Walker Street. The building has a rectangular plan and corrugated iron clad hipped roof. The building has a centrally located, one storeyed arcaded projection from the front facade, which is formed by three arched openings forming an entrance loggia. Flanking this are two square headed openings, which also line the two stories of the other facades. A two storeyed rear verandah has been enclosed with fibrous cement sheeting and glazing. The building is substantially intact with few internal alterations.  1938 former Operating Theatre (now CSSD)  This is a one storeyed rough cast rendered brick building, centrally located on the site adjacent to the western side of the Demaine Block and behind A Block. This building has a corrugated iron clad hipped roof with a central projecting gable on the former front elevation, which is clad with a decorative Spanish Mission inspired parapeted gable element extending the full height of the building. The building features a number of large, steel framed window opening, comprising a number of hinged operable glazing panels.  1950 former Dining room (now School of Nursing)  This is a simple rectangular planned timber framed and clad building with hipped corrugated iron roof. The building is slightly elevated from the ground on timber stumps with timber framed hinged windows lining each of the elevations. Adjoining the two shorter ends of the buildings are shorter hipped roof projections. The building is substantially intact.  1950 Kitchen  This is a single storeyed brick building lined with iron framed window openings. The building has a rectangular floor plan and a gabled roof. Various brick additions have been made to this structure. The main food preparation area is at the western end of the building and a staff dining room is at the eastern end. This building has a large internal space divided by a concrete partition and remains substantially intact.  1950 Residence  This duplex residence, facing Yaralla Street, is constructed from polychrome brick. The building is symmetrically composed and has a hipped roof clad with ceramic tiles. The Yaralla Street elevation of the building has a central projection which is hipped roofed and features a line of six openings filled with timber framed hopper windows, which are aligned with six oversized ventilation openings at ground level. Flanking the windows are two iron grilled openings.  1951 former Ambulance (now Engineers' Workshop)  This is an interesting one storeyed partially rendered brick building facing Neptune Street, whose skillion roof is concealed by a rendered parapet. At the northern corner of the Neptune Street facade is a large square planned brick tower which has parallel vertical rendered brick fin elements and a rendered parapet and projecting brick quoining at the corners. A narrow cantilevered awning surrounds the building. Four large full length openings, originally used as ambulance vehicle bays give access to the building from Neptune Street.  Other structures on the site  A and B Blocks are large three and four storeyed brick buildings which dominate the site and are situated along the Walker Street boundary. The buildings comprise a number of variously aged additions but are characterised by flat face brick facades with horizontal strip openings and narrow vertical and horizontal fins used as sunshading devices. The 1965 maternity block is located at the northern, rear end of the site. The one storeyed brick building is diagonally sited and has an L-shaped plan. The longer section of the L houses wards which have access to front and rear concrete framed verandahs. The building has a number of concrete surrounded window openings and a quite flat skillioned roof. The pathology lab is a one storeyed L-shaped planned brick building centrally located on the site near the 1950 timber kitchen. A large two storeyed brick boiler is located on the Neptune Street elevation of the site. It has a dramatic steeply pitched skillion roof and horizontal strip openings and external concrete framing.  Heritage listing  Maryborough Base Hospital was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 2 February 1998 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The site demonstrates the growth of Maryborough from a small settlement to a large provincial town in the latter part of the nineteenth century and through the twentieth century. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Maryborough Hospital is exceptional and rare in demonstrating the development of hospital sites in Queensland from the nineteenth century through the twentieth century. The site retains buildings from all periods of its development and many of these buildings are substantially intact. Centre block, C Block and the 1887 medical superintendent's residence are rare surviving hospital buildings from the nineteenth century. C Block is a rare surviving example of a pavilion planned ward in Queensland, an extensive number of such hospital wards were constructed but few have survived twentieth century development. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The site is important for its potential to reveal further information about the planning and development of hospitals dating from the nineteenth century. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Maryborough Hospital demonstrates the principal characteristics of a Queensland hospital, on a large site on elevated ground away from the town centre. Individual buildings on the site are also able to demonstrate characteristics of hospital buildings, including nineteenth century pavilion ward planning; nurses quarters from the late 1920s and the late 1930s; maternity ward from 1928, several hospital residences and quarters; an ambulance station and morgue. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The site has aesthetic significance as a prominent Maryborough landmark. Individual buildings on the site have architectural merit as well composed buildings with significant streetscape and landmark qualities, including the remnants of the nineteenth century buildings, the two nurses quarters, ambulance station, former 1929 maternity hospital, single storeyed residence on the corner of Yaralla and Walker Streets and two storeyed residence on Walker Street. Other elements on the site contribute to aesthetic and historical significance of the site including the morgue, duplex on Yaralla Street, dining room, established trees and bed plantings and the bus shelter. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The site is important to the Maryborough community as their principal site of public health care for about 110 years. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The site is associated with many early prominent Maryborough citizens who were instrumental in establishing the site and with architects John James Clark and POE Hawkes who designed many of the buildings.

They usually swim around in pairs and are territorial. Normally this species feeds exclusively on the polyps of the tubular Acropora corals. However, given that it has been observed in the Mediterranean, where coral growth is limited, it may be able to adapt to a different diet. Phylogeny The hooded butterflyfish is a far western sister species of the triangle butterflyfish (C. triangulum), which lives in the Indian Ocean, and C. baronessa, which inhabits the Indo-Pacific. Together these species form the subgenus Gonochaetodon. If Chaetodon is split up as some researchers propose, this group might go into Megaprotodon with other high-backed and square-bodied species, but its exact relationships are still not well known.

The painting has three sections, each representing a theme: commerce, education, and the outdoors. It depicts figures adorned with symbolism related to characters in Greek mythology, including Hermes, Athena, and Demeter, along with local businesses and local landmarks such as the neighborhood farmers' market, Grand Central Bakery, Portland Fish Market, Woodstock Park, and the Woodstock Library. The Woodstock Neighborhood Association (WNA) originally made plans for a mural on the exterior wall of Lutz Tavern. Following an outreach effort to identify an artist, Lawrence and WNA met for a brainstorming session, during which they agreed on theme's for the proposed public artwork. Even after some funding was secured, efforts stalled. The association later proposed a mural for the nearby Red Fox Vintage building. The original mural was completed on the Red Fox Vintage building by Heidi Schultz in November 2013. However, shortly after its completion, New Seasons announced the construction of a new grocery store next to the mural. The company offered to reproduce the painting on the east side of an adjacent building or the west side of the planned building. Dan Cohen and his assistant were hired to reproduce the mural, which was completed in October 2015. Description The original mural on the west side of the Red Fox Vintage building in December 2013 Woodstock Mural was designed by artist Mike Lawrence as a work divided into three sections. According to the Regional Arts & Culture Council (RACC), each section includes a central figure adorned with symbolism associated with Greek mythology, representing one of three themes: commerce, education, and the outdoors. The Portland Tribune described the mural as \\"rich in latent symbolism with more mysterious content\\", referring to the mythological symbolism in particular. The original painting measured x . In 2015, the mural was reproduced on another wall following construction of an adjacent new building housing a New Seasons Market; the new building hid the original mural. The \\"imposing\\" reproduction, as described by The Bee, a community newspaper, measures x . Commerce, represented on the left side, is depicted by a shopkeeper wearing a hat with the wings of Hermes, the Greek god of commerce (or, according to some sources, Mercury, the Roman god of commerce). The business owner is bearded and wears a crocus flower in his apron. He has a tattoo of the caduceus, the staff carried by Hermes Trismegistus in Egyptian mythology and Hermes in Greek mythology. In his store is a shelf with other symbolic items that represent local businesses. The center section is devoted to education and depicts Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom, in the form of a girl in the Woodstock Library. She is adorned with an owl on her shoulder and an olive branch necklace. She holds a tiger lily in her hand. Woodstock School's Mandarin Immersion Program is honored with an arc of Chinese characters above the girl's head, written on a chalkboard. The Mandarin Chinese text translates to \\"A nice place to live\\" or \\"It's a great place to live\\", which is Woodstock's motto. According to The Bee, the central section also represents other neighborhood schools and the neighborhood's close proximity to Reed College. The mural's right section depicts Demeter, the Greek goddess of the harvest, in the form of an Asian female urban farmer at the neighborhood farmers' market. She wears poppies in her headdress, giving the appearance of a crown, and has a tattoo of a sheaf of wheat. Next to her is a cornucopia, which symbolizes abundance and nourishment. She holds a lotus staff, described as a \\"flaming torch\\". The figure also represents \\"the love of gardening\\". Douglas fir trees and Woodstock Park, specifically its off-leash dog area, are also depicted in the painting's right section. History The mural was originally planned for the exterior wall of Lutz Tavern. The Woodstock Neighborhood Association (WNA) originally made plans to paint a community mural on the east exterior of Lutz Tavern. Following an outreach effort to locate an artist, WNA and Lawrence held a brainstorming session. Kenny Heggem, who served as the project manager of the mural committee, recalled, \\"We talked about our fantastic park and its leash-free dog area, Woodstock Elementary's Mandarin Immersion Program, and our awesome library.\\" The session resulted in the group's choosing the mural's three themes. In August 2012, RACC confirmed funding of $6,000 for the x painting. The mural's design was divided into three parts to accommodate the exterior wall's three sections. RACC published an image of Lawrence's proposed mural and said the goal of the project was to \\"highlight the best of the neighborhood and instill a sense of community pride\\". The agency also said the project was still raising funds and hoped to start in the spring of 2013. Efforts stalled, but WNA later proposed a mural with a different design for the east side of the Red Fox Vintage building, located at the intersection of Southeast 46th Avenue and Southeast Woodstock Boulevard. According to the Portland Tribune, the project was a collaboration between local businesses, institutions, and neighborhood residents. Beaver State Scaffolding and Sherwin-Williams both contributed resources to the project. RACC awarded partial grant funding through its Public Art Murals Program, which is funded by the City of Portland and \\"provides funding for community murals that reflect diversity in style and media and encourages artists from diverse backgrounds and range of experience to apply\\". WNA volunteers also assisted, led by Heggem and Becky Luening, head of the neighborhood association. Heidi Schultz of Schultz Art & Design served as the project's production manager. She created a pattern against the wall using Lawrence's digital design, then mixed the paint, completed the mural, and added a clear coating for protection. Painting the mural took about six weeks, and it was mostly finished by November 2013. Red Fox Vintage hosted a party to celebrate the work's completion on December 14. The mural took nearly two years to plan and complete, which was longer than expected. Reproduction The original mural covered by new construction Not long after the mural's completion, New Seasons Market announced plans to build a new store immediately adjacent to the mural. In January 2014, the co-owner of Red Fox Vintage, said, \\"We're going to have a sit-down with New Seasons about the mural. To the best of my knowledge, New Seasons will make it right.\\" She shared three options to discuss with the company: repainting the mural on Red Fox's east wall, transferring it to the new store's exterior wall, or keeping the original mural in place and making it visible from the grocery store's interior. New Seasons met with WNA and offered to reproduce the painting, either on the east side of the Red Fox Vintage building or the west side of the planned grocery store. Luening said the latter option was more practical, because the artist could paint on panels in her studio instead of working outside. New Seasons hired Dan Cohen of Dan Cohen Creative Labs to duplicate the mural using a method similar to one he uses in his work as a \\"mega mural\\" painter. He said of the process: > I paint giant advertising murals all over the country. I do about one mural > a month. We create the pattern using the original image, and paint on top of > it. We use a special machine [to create the underlying design] that works > like an arc welder. During construction of the new building and the mural's transfer, New Seasons displayed a banner which read, \\"The mural will return\\". Cohen and his assistant, Christo Wunderlich, transferred the design using a machine, then painted the art by hand. The duo also added bread and a fish to the mural to represent the local businesses Grand Central Bakery and Portland Fish Market, respectively. The new store opened in October 2015.

Her subject matters include power structures, gender issues, existential questions and intimacy.  Education  Snövit Hedstierna holds a Master of Fine Arts from Concordia University in Montreal, Canada, and a degree from Valand Academy in Gothenburg, Sweden. She holds further formal qualifications in related fields such as photography, communication and advertising.  Approach  Her work frequently includes and builds upon the lived experience of non-conforming individuals (\\"in the periphery\\"), which she re-contexutalizes using established artistic frameworks such as film, photography, performance and dance. She seeks to transcend formal categories of artistic expression by creating experiential spaces that engage the audience in a variety of sensory and conceptional modalities, most notably intimate touch. One of her most influential works incorporates extensive sociological research: over a period of 3 years, she conducted 250 in-depth interviews with female/queer/ transgender and gender fluid individuals from all Nordic countries.  Subject Matters  Her work has focused on gender rights as a main topic since 2013, beginning with her graduation show from Valand Academy where she displayed the photo series Practices of Looking, and the related group performance Another View, which was considered controversial for its depictions of nudity. Snövit Hedstierna has created several exhibitions where the audience has been invited to participate in different ways. One was her thesis show at Valand, To Give and To Hold, a 48 hours long durational performance where the artist offered her body as spoon for anyone in the audience saying \\"she rather spoon with someone than shoot someone\\" as a comment to the growing otherness in society. During late September 2015 Snövit Hedstierna exhibited a one-on-one performance and installation in the \\"Dream a Dream\\" solo show at the Abteilung für Alles Andere. The artist described the exhibition as \\"A guided sleep meditation in an experimental and transcendental environment, now and forever.\\" During Manifesta11 in Zürich 2016, she performed the piece A source of Values in which the audience were invited to wash her naked body with a sponge, soap and water. She exhibited the video installation Sisterhood at the Pane Per Poveri pavilion at The Venice Biennale 2015 (La Biennale di Venezia).  Notable Exhibitions  Between 2014-2016 she conducted the three years long research project An Issue of Structure, in which she compared The World Economic Forum's “Global Gender Gap Report” and the FRA-report with in-depth interviews from 250 female/queer/ transgender/gender fluid people, to shed light on personal experiences of gender and gender affiliations in the Nordic countries. The work resulted in several installations in so called \\"episodes\\" that the artist have been exhibiting between 2016-2017 around the Nordic Countries. During mid September 2015 she exhibited in Los Angeles alongside artists such as Kim Gordon, Kathleen Hanna and Barbara Kruger as she participated in Jessie Askinazi and Rose McGowan's Yes All Women art show, named after the #YesAllWomen hashtag. Hedstierna contributed with photography and also with the epic performance You Are Not Alone which got reviewed as \\"bare and gutting\\". During 2018 she again participated in Manifesta12 in Palermo by showing the piece Achievement of falling at the collateral event Politics of Dissonance. During 2018 the artist is working on the production of four new feature films within the speculative dystopian sci-fi genre, accompanied by a VR-movie to be released in September 2018. Earlier exhibitions include Manifesta12 Politics of dissonance, Norrtälje Konsthall, Mengi (Reykjavik), Malmö Konsthall, Skövde Konsthall, Göteborgs Konsthall, Strömstad Konsthall, Göteborg International Biennal for Contemporary Art, and Norrtälje Konsthall.  Activism  In 2017, the Swedish art magazine Konstnären published an open statement by the artist about her experiences of sexual assault within the art world, which evoked a larger debate. She has since been an active participant in the #metoo movement, focussing mainly on her experience within the Scandinavian art scene. She participated in several talks and debates in both Norway, Sweden and Denmark during 2017-2018.

It is integrated in the Central Secular Council (Conseil central laïque), which also coordinates deMens.nu (formerly UVV) in Flanders.  Philosophical principles  The CAL asserts that a secular state or system treats all citizens according to the same standard, or confers on them the same rights and duties, regardless of their religion and their philosophical convictions. In French-speaking Belgium, the term laïcité (\\"secularity\\" or \\"secularism\\") is both used for designating the secular movement that groups associations and individuals who, besides their struggle in favour of the secularity of the state, share a conception of life free of any reference to the supernatural. Alongside the traditional faith communities, the Belgian state recognises and finances the nonreligious community. The laïcité concept supports universality, equality and non-discrimination between human beings. The laïques (\\"secularists\\") are working to ensure that the state, its laws and organisation defends these values. This idea of secularism as the basis of common values is one of the democratic principles that govern modern states. It relies in particular on the principles expressed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Activities  The Centre d'Action Laïque (CAL) is an association without lucrative purpose (asbl) founded on 29 March 1969. It assures the defence and promotion of secularism in French-speaking Belgium. Through its various regional and local entities, the CAL is involved in urban life. It thinks about, debates and acts on all aspects of life and society: gender equality, education, the beginning and end of life, interculturalism, incarceration, addiction, freedom... Its principles are solidarity and the promoting of critical thinking.  Organisation  The CAL federates 7 regional branches and coordinates 28 secularist associations. The CAL's regional branches are organised by province, with the exception of Hainaut that has two (Mons and Charleroi) and Brussels (which is not a province). Each local establishment chooses privileged areas of application and defines its organisation according to its environment, its audiences and goals to achieve. The CAL's Flemish equivalent is deMens.nu. Together, they constitute the Conseil Central Laïque/Centrale Vrijzinnige Raad (CCL/CVR, \\"Central Secular Council/Central Freethought Council\\"),Conseil Central des communautés philosophiques non confessionnelles de Belgique ou Conseil Central Laïque (CCL), lire en ligne . the representative organ of the nonreligious community of Belgium. On European level, the Centre d'Action Laïque is member of the European Humanist Federation (EHF). On global level, it is member of the International Humanist and Ethical Union (IHEU).  Publications  The Centre d'Action Laïque publishes the monthly magazine Espace de libertés (\\"Space of Liberties\\"), Outils de réflexion (\\"Tools for thought\\"), the collection of essays Liberté, j'écris ton nom (\\"Freedom, I write your name\\") and various works including Découvrir la laïcité (\\"Discovering Secularism\\").

It is a historical adventure strip set in the 16th century, drawn in a realistic style with much attention to detail. It is often regarded as De Moor's magnum opus. Concept Ever since his youth Bob de Moor was fascinated by ship transport, which echoed back in his later comic strips. An early predecessor of the series was \\"Bart de Scheepsjongen\\" (1945) (\\"Bart the Cabin Boy\\"), which he drew for \\"De Kleine Zondagsvriend\\".http://www.bobdemoor.info/tag/cori-le- moussaillon/ In 1950 Lombard Editions approached him to draw a comic series that would appeal to the Flemish and Dutch readers. De Moor created a series set in the 16th century during the background of the Eighty Years' War between the Netherlands and Spain. The orphan child Cori is kidnapped by pirates, but later saved by the Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie. He is adopted by commander Harm Janszoon and joins them as a cabin boy and travels along during their exploration of South-East Asia, Africa, America and the Arctic. He gets involved in sea battles against pirates and the Spanish Armada, among other endeavours. He also meets real-life historical characters Piet Heyn, Pieter van der Does, Joris van Spilbergen, Willem Janszoon and Willem Barents. Later stories are set at the start of the 17th century, despite Cori not aging much. The first album was published in the magazine Tintin between 1951 and 1952. Since most of De Moor's time was taken up by his work for Hergé's studio he was largely unable to find time to draw his own stories until Hergé's death in 1983.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/d/de- moor_bob.htmhttp://bdoubliees.com/journaltintin/series1/cori.htm De Moor was aided by his assistant Geert de Sutter.

Most US zinc came from the Red Dog mine in Alaska. The industry employed about 2,500 in mining and milling, and 250 in smelting. Current zinc-mining districts In 2019 zinc was mined in six States at 15 mines operated by five companies. Red Dog Mine, Alaska In 2019, 552,400 tonnes of zinc, 71 percent of US mined zinc production, and 4.2 percent of world zinc production, came from Teck Resources' Red Dog mine, the world's most productive zinc mine, in northwest Alaska, near Kotzebue. The mine opened in 1989.The world's top three zinc mines, Investing News. The zinc is shipped as concentrate to foreign smelters. The Red Dog is a polymetallic deposit, which also produces lead and silver concentrates. Admiralty Island, Alaska Hecla Mining's Greens Creek mine located south-southwest of Juneau, Alaska, on Admiralty Island, opened in August 1989. The mine produces silver, gold, zinc and lead from a structurally and mineralogically complex VMS deposit. In 2019 it produced 56,805 tonnes of zinc in concentrate as a byproduct of silver-gold mining. Coeur D'Alene district, Idaho At the Coeur D'Alene mining district in northern Idaho, zinc is produced as a byproduct of silver mining in Hecla Mining's Lucky Friday mine. In 2019 the mine produced 2,052 tonnes of zinc in concentrate. Viburnum Trend, Missouri Doe Run Resources' mines on carbonate-hosted lead-zinc deposits (Mississippi Valley-type deposits) in the Southeast Missouri Lead District include Casteel, Buick, Brushy Creek, Fletcher, Sweetwater and Mine No. 29. Middle and East Tennessee Zinc Complexes, Tennessee In the Middle and East Tennessee Zinc Complexes, Nyrstar's six mines produce zinc from carbonate-hosted lead-zinc deposits. They are the Coy, Immel, and Young mines in the East Tennessee Zinc Complex, and the Gordonsville, Elmwood, and Cumberland mines in the Middle Tennessee Zinc Complex. Nyrstar produced 115,000 tonnes of zinc in concentrate from its East and Middle Tennessee mines in 2018. Metaline district, Washington In July 2019 Teck Resources' Pend Oreille mine in Washington's Metaline mining district ceased production due to exhaustion of reserves. Former zinc-mining districts=Tri-state district The Tri-State district of Missouri, Oklahoma and Kansas was the major zinc mining district in the United States, with production of 10.6 million tonnes of zinc from c.1850 through 1967. The Eagle-Picher mine of Cardin, Oklahoma, the largest and longest lived mine, ceased production in 1967. Franklin mining district, New Jersey The Franklin and Sterling Hill deposits with production of 6.3 million tonnes of zinc, account for 15 percent of all recorded zinc production in the contiguous United States. Major mining began about 1870, and the Sterling Hill mine was the last working underground mine in New Jersey when it closed in 1986. Southeast Missouri lead district Zinc was produced as a byproduct of lead mining in the Southeast Missouri Lead District. Austinville-Ivanhoe district, Virginia Mining operations began in 1756 in the Austinville- Ivanhoe District of Wythe County, Virginia. By the time the mine closed in 1981, it was the most continuously mined base metal deposit in North America, with a total production of 1.4 million tonnes of zinc. Smelting The US has two smelter facilities, one primary and one secondary, producing commercial- grade zinc metal. Primary smelters produce metal from ore. The only US primary zinc smelter, the Nyrstar smelter at Clarksville, Tennessee, produced 120 tonnes of zinc, from a mix of ore from six mines in middle and east Tennessee, and recycled zinc products. Secondary zinc smelters produce zinc from recycled materials. A secondary zinc smelter in Pennsylvania closed in 2014, the operations being shifted to a new smelter in North Carolina using solvent extraction/electrowinning (SXEW). In addition, some non-smelting zinc recycling operations produced small amounts of zinc. The total amount of zinc produced from secondary operations was 70 tons. For primary and secondary smelters taken together, recycled products accounted for 25 percent (30,000 tonnes) of the refined zinc produced in US in 2019.Zinc, in Minerals Summary 2015, US Geological Survey. Through 1940, the production of primary zinc by US smelters approximated the mined production of zinc ore. When zinc demand increased during World War II, US smelters turned to foreign zinc ore. US- smelted zinc reached a high of 926,000 tonnes in 1970, then dropped as smelters closed. There were 12 primary zinc smelters in 1970, but only seven in 1980, three in 1990, and two in 2000. Today, there is one operating primary zinc smelter, in Clarksville, Tennessee, which produces zinc from mines in the East Tennessee and Middle Tennessee districts. All other zinc concentrates are exported and smelted abroad. Byproducts of zinc A number of elements are recovered in flue gas and flue dust in zinc smelters. These include the metal cadmium and the semi-metals gallium and germanium. In 1970, for every ton of zinc produced at a US smelter, there were also recovered 4.2 kilograms of cadmium, 53 grams of germanium, 18 grams of indium, and 2.9 grams of thallium.R.A. Heindl, '\\"Zinc,\\" in Mineral Facts and Problems, US Bureau of Mines, Bulletin 650, 1970, p.814. These elements are concentrated as impurities in the zinc mineral sphalerite. The elements are more abundant in sphalerite from ore deposits with lower formation temperatures, such as Mississippi Valley-type deposits. The Middle and East Tennessee zinc mines are Mississippi Valley-type. Cadmium recovered in zinc smelting is the only commercial source of cadmium. Gallium and germanium are also recovered some from other sulfide ores. Some germanium is also recovered from aluminum smelting. In previous years, indium and thallium were recovered from zinc smelting, but as of 2015, they were not being recovered from American zinc smelters. According to the British Geological Survey, in 2011, US zinc smelting recovered about 600 tonnes of cadmium, three tonnes of gallium, and three tonnes of germanium.World Mineral Production 2007-11, British Geological Survey, 2013. Consumption In 2019, the US consumed 950,000 tons of zinc. Most zinc is used for galvanizing, followed by brass and bronze, and zinc- based alloys. International trade The United States is a net importer of zinc (87% of consumption). In 2019 it imported 830,000 tonnes of refined zinc metal and products. In the same year, the US exported 870,000 tonnes of zinc in ore concentrates, mostly from the Red Dog Mine in Alaska. During the period 2015-2018, imports were primarily from Canada (64%), Mexico (13%), Australia (7%), and Peru (7%).

Research network for the archaeological study of the Saxons and their neighbouring peoples in northwestern Europe\\"), is an international society for \\"the continuous, joint – international – study of the history and ethnic origins of the Germanic Saxons\\". A secondary stated goal \\"is to discuss the relevant relationships that existed between all these populations and that can be detected in the countries bordering the North and Baltic Seas.\\" The organisation has been credited with stimulating the publication of material from both the collections of museums, and contemporary excavations, and is considered the authoritative forum for the discussion of the archaeology of northwestern Europe in the first millennium AD. Membership is by election; today the organisation comprises approximately 180 members, from Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Finland, France, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden, and the United States. History The Royal Armouries replica of the Sutton Hoo helmet was unveiled at the 1973 symposium. The Internationales Sachsensymposion was founded in Cuxhaven, Germany, in 1949, although it is currently organised under Belgian law. It was initially known as the Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Sachsenforschung (Study Group for Saxon Research), and was formed at the instigation of Karl Waller, then the head of the office for the protection of prehistoric monuments in urban Cuxhaven, as a way to facilitate the study of ancient Saxons. The organisation was also intended to help reestablish post-War relations with the North Sea countries by focusing on shared archaeological problems. Fourteen scholars were invited to the first symposium, held from 21 to 23 November 1949 in Cuxhaven. Following the death of Waller in 1963, meetings continued under the leadership of Albert Genrich (de), who had been a co-founder and active participant. Later, from 1996 to 2002, Hans-Jürgen Häßler served as chairman. With few interruptions the Sachsensymposion has met annually since 1949, most recently holding its 68th symposium over five days in September 2017, in Canterbury. It was the first time the conference was held in that city, as was co-hosted by Canterbury Christ Church University, Canterbury Archaeological Trust and the University of Kent. The symposia have broadened over time, and now function as a forum to discuss the archaeology of early northwestern Europe; though generally held in Germany, other hosts have included the Netherlands, Belgium, the Scandinavian countries, and, multiple times, England. The 24th rendition, held in London in September 1973, was the occasion for the \\"theatrical\\" unveiling of the Royal Armouries replica of the Anglo-Saxon Sutton Hoo helmet. Preceding an evening address, the lights were dimmed; down the aisle came Nigel Williams holding a replica of the Sutton Hoo whetstone; and behind him followed Rupert Bruce-Mitford, wearing a carriage rug and with hands hieratically crossed, wearing the Royal Armouries helmet and reciting the opening lines of Beowulf. Members of the Sachsensymposion hail from eleven countries, and include Martin Carver, Helena Hamerow, Barbara Yorke, and Alex Woolf. Nancy Wicker of the University of Mississippi, as of 2017, is the only American ever elected a member. Early participants in the Sachsensymposion included Fritz Tischler (de) and Joachim Werner.

Lim was twice appointed as Dean of the Faculty of Science at the University of Singapore (now the National University of Singapore), the first woman to hold that position. After her retirement, she became the first Director of Singapore's National Institute of Education and helped it launch a university degree program. She served on the Public Service Commission as its first woman commissioner for 14 years, and then served as general manager of the Community Mediation Unit for 8 years. She has received numerous honours and awards for her contributions to science and to improving education in Singapore.  Early life and education  Gloria Lim was born in Singapore in 1930. While the girls school she attended did not teach sciences, she graduated from the University of Singapore with a BS in botany with first- class honours in 1954. She earned a Diploma in Education in 1956 and an MS in plant pathology in 1957 from the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur. Lim began teaching at the Raffles Girls' School; she later was hired to teach at the University of Malaya and divided her time teaching at Raffles in the morning and botany at the university in the afternoons. She was awarded an Inter-University Council Fellowship which allowed her to attend the University of London. Lim earned her doctorate in 1961 and then attended the University of California, Berkeley, on a Fulbright Fellowship between 1966 and 1967, becoming a mycologist. Scientific career Returning to Singapore, Lim became an expert on fungi and built up a unique repository of the region's fungal species, writing hundreds of research articles and consulting with universities and businesses at home and abroad. She worked on the advisory board of a company developing medicinal mushrooms, and assisted the Singaporean Ministry of Defence when their storage bunkers developed mould. After her retirement, the collection of various species was disassembled and destroyed. Academic career Lim was named Dean of the Faculty of Science at the University of Singapore in 1973, becoming the first woman to hold the position. Her first appointment lasted four years and then she was appointed again to serve in 1979, but she resigned in 1980 when the university merged with Nanyang University, to allow Nanyang's former Dean to continue in the post. In 1982 she became the first woman to serve on the Public Service Commission (PSC), and in 1985 became the first woman to head the Department of Botany when the university became the National University of Singapore (NUS). Lim retired from the NUS in 1991 and took a position at the National Institute of Education (NIE) as its inaugural director. Her job was to develop the Institute of Education (IE) on a fully accredited university standard; when she retired in 1994, the program was offering undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral degree programs. Other activities Between 2003 and 2011, Lim served as general manager of the Community Mediation Unit (CMU), a board designed to solve community disputes. Awards and honours In 1993 Lim was honoured with the Bintang Bakti Masyarakat (Public Service Star) for her contributions to the PSC, which she continued to serve until 1996. Lim retired from NIE in 1994. In July 1999, she was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Science from Loughborough University in England for her contributions to science and education in Singapore.

It is the oldest \\"little theatre\\" in the United Kingdom, being defined as being an amateur theatre that owns, leases or otherwise has control of its own premises.  Foundation and early years  In the summer and autumn of 1901 the drama group that was based at the Stockport Unitarian Sunday School on Petersgate was rehearsing a production of The Merchant of Venice. The church organist who was also directing the production and who was a qualified engineer, Edwin T. Heys, decided that to avoid the tortuous trek through the church on the floor above the playing space to get from one wing to the other, the solution would be to dig a tunnel under the stage. This he and his headstrong colleagues proceeded to do until the excavations were discovered by the authorities and put a stop to. The incensed actors gathered at the Church Coffee Tavern opposite under the chairmanship of Heys on 24 October and formed themselves into an independent dramatic literary company which they decided to call the Garrick Society. It was decided that the production in rehearsal would be the first play presented by the new society and a semi-professional director, Ryder Boys, was engaged to produce the work at the Mechanics Institute at the end of February and the beginning of March 1902. It played to great acclaim and was followed in the same year by Sheridan's The School for Scandal and then by Macbeth and The Rivals. Some of the larger scale plays were performed at Stockports' Frank Matcham theatre, the Theatre Royal. The premises on Wellington Street were used for more intimate productions and ones which had not been licensed by the Lord Chamberlain such as Maeterlinck's Monna Vanna and several works by Ibsen and Shaw. Despite the calling up of many of the society's young men during the First World War, the society continued its work during the war years and seems to have escaped relatively unscathed, continuing to present between four and eight plays per season until peace came in November 1918.  1920–62  During the First World War a scheme for acquiring new larger premises was being mooted. This came to fruition in 1920 with the formation of a limited company, the chairman of which was Edwin Heys. The building which was acquired was on the corner of Exchange Street and Wellington Road South where the present theatre stands today. It was then an engineering works and contained various other enterprises including a Spiritualist Church. In 1925 funds were raised to raise the roof, which was until then supported on low beams and in 1935-6 new rooms were constructed above what was then called the Minor Hall and which is now the bar and studio theatre. As well as continuing to present productions of the classics, especially Shakespeare, Ibsen and Shaw, the 1920s and '30s saw a flowering of home-grown talent in the presentation of works by Garrick members including Ross Hills, Channon Collinge, Percy Corry and Alfred Jepson. The Second World War seems to have been more traumatic for the society than the First, with many members who had joined the forces not returning and several of the founder members dying during the war years. However the seasons of plays continued throughout, boosted it would seem by an influx of members of Stockport Operatic Society who had ceased to function for the time being, enabling the Garrick to put on several Gilbert and Sullivans and a couple of other operas. After the war a general sense of exhaustion and depression seemed to have set in, relieved somewhat by the 50th-anniversary celebrations in 1951 and even more so by the extensive rebuilding and refurbishment work in 1962, necessitated and financed by the local council's compulsory purchase of a \\"slice\\" of the building to enable the widening of Exchange Street. The cantilevered extension over the Exchange Street pavement was constructed, the auditorium was raked, new seats installed, the windows closed off and open fireplaces removed. The name of the building, which had until then been known as the Garrick Hall, was changed to the Garrick Theatre as it has been known ever since.  1962 to the present  The installation of a bar in 1973, despite strong opposition from certain die-hard members, further lifted the spirits as did another major reconstruction of the auditorium and the creation of further rooms at the rear in 1984; much of the preparatory work was carried out by members themselves. Most recently a major reconstruction of the bar area, providing facilities for it to double as a studio theatre, took place in 2010. From the outset the Garrick Theatre has often been adventurous in its choice of plays, with a particular love of Shakespeare which continues to this day (recently being involved with the RSC's Open Stages project), early productions of Ibsen, Shaw, Synge, Yeats, Hauptmann and Tagore gradually giving way in the middle years of the century to the more frivolous offerings of Noël Coward, Somerset Maugham, Alan Melville and the like. After the radical shift in theatrical tastes caused by the 1956 production of John Osborne's Look Back in Anger the Garrick gradually began to come up to date with productions of Osborne himself, Samuel Beckett, Arnold Wesker, Arthur Miller, David Hare and Simon Gray whilst continuing to lighten the mix with Alan Ayckbourn, popular West End hits and the occasional musical when the membership's talents lay in that direction. In the 1980s and '90s a number of amateur premieres were secured, including A Little Night Music (Sondheim & Wheeler), My Mother Said I Never Should (Charlotte Keatley), Corpse (Gerald Moon), Fools and Star-Spangled Girl (both by Neil Simon) and also from the mid-1970s to the late 1990s the theatre took several productions on tour to Buxton Opera House, the Isle of Man Festival, the Dundalk Festival in Eire, several venues in the U.S. and also two trips to Stockport's twin town in Germany, Heilbronn. Since the bar refurbishment the Garrick Studio has produced a wider variety of plays, presenting intimate, exciting and sometimes controversial plays by playwrights such as David Mamet, David Harrower, Jean- Paul Sartre, Yasmina Reza, Andrew Bovell, John Godber, Laura Wade, Dennis Kelly, Joe Penhall and Simon Stephens. It also enabled the theatre to encourage the development of new writing for the stage in Stockport. The Youth Theatre has flourished in the past few years, presenting main stage productions and showcase performances each year. In recent years, Garrick Youth has grown from 1 weekly group of 20 students (aged 14–18) to 5 Weekly groups for around 100 students (aged 7–18). In 2016 BBC Radio 4 recorded Mark Steel's in Town from the theatre. In May 2018, Stockport Garrick hosted their first Stockport Festival of New Writing. A week long festival championing new writing for the stage. It included development performances by brand new plays by Stockport and Greater Manchester Playwrights and talks and workshops by theatre Makers. Simon Stephens, patron for the Festival, gave a talk discussing his Stockport Plays (Port, On the Shore of the Wide World, Punk Rock and Blindsided) with Stockport actor Katie West. Extracts from the Stockport Plays were directed and performed by Garrick members.

The picture was shot on the studio’s back lot along with outdoor locations at Iverson Ranch in Chatsworth, Los Angeles, CA, USA.The Old Corral B-Westerns Plot Red Ryder (Wild Bill Elliott) and Little Beaver (Robert Blake) return to Blue Springs of 1895 only to discover that the Duchess (Alice Fleming), Red’s aunt, is preparing to sell her stage coach line and marry an Englishman, Talbot Champneys (Ian Keith). Unbeknownst to them, Champneys is really a conman named Fancy Charlie, who has made a career of marrying rich women and then killing them for their money. The Duchess’ other suitors Earle Hodgins and Tom London are unhappy when her engagement to Champneys aka Fancy Charlie is announced. Red meets Champneys at the Duchess’ ranch where he also meets Fancy Charlie’s confederate, Celeste (Virginia Christine), who poses as a couturiere. The outlaws, Ace Hanlon (William Haade) and Pete Burdet (Bud Geary) appear suddenly at the ranch to greet Champneys. Champneys is surprised to see them because Burdet was once Fancy Charlie’s cellmate. Burdet has tipped off Ace Hanlon and now both of them want to be cut in on Fancy Charlie’s deal and share in the Duchess’ fortune. Charlie refuses, and Burdett starts beating on him when Red arrives and captures Burdett but misses Hanlon who flees in time to escape. Charlie asks Red to let Burdet go, explaining that he is merely an acquaintance who cheated him in a poker game. Red is reluctant to comply but does so when Charlie insists. Red remains concerned about his aunt but acquiesces to her demands but when he later sees Champneys mistreating Thunder (Red’s horse), Red intercedes and knocks him down. He decides to investigate and secretly wires the British consul for information about Champneys. Afraid that Red will ruin his plans, Charlie finally decides to offer Hanlon and Burdett a fifty- percent share of his profits if they get ride of Red and Little Beaver. Charlie then proceeds to inform the Duchess that he must return to England immediately and wants her to go with him so they can be married along the way. She agrees to go despite Red's strenuous objections. Charlie smiles, knowing that he has fully persuaded the Duchess to return to England with him and to bring her money with her. They agree to meet at the railroad station. In the meantime, Celeste overhears Red and Little Beaver talking about picking up the reply from the British consul. Hanlon and Burdett are notified and make preparation to capture the two at the telegraph office. Red and Little Beaver are held prisoner overnight and the next morning, Charlie taunts them by congratulating Red on seeing through his disguise and charade but then assures the red-headed cowboy that the Duchess will soon be dead. Ace Hanlon suspects that Fancy Charlie might double cross him and Burdet so instead of killing Red and Little Beaver, they plan to keep them alive until after the Duchess is killed. Fortunately, Red and Little Beaver cleverly escape and rush to stop Fancy Charlie and save the Duchess. They arrive just in time. Ace Hanlon, Burdet, and Fancy Charlie escape, feeling out of town on a stagecoach. Red leaps into the saddle and he and Thunder race after them. In what is arguably one of motion picture’s most exciting stagecoach chases, Red finally manages to shoo Burdett and overcomes Hanlon in a fight. Fancy Charlie is captured and his nefarious plot is exposed. He is on the way to jail, but not before the Duchess hits him square in the face with their wedding cake.Plot Summary, Phantom of the Plains (1945)Drew, Bernard A.; Red Ryder and Little Beaver: Painted Valley Troubleshooters.

Orashi takes off, 183 m above mean sea level, from the rocks in Ezeama community of Dikenafai, Imo State. Described as a lifeline to Ideato South communities, Orashi stream serves as an all purpose river for drinking, washing and many others to communities such as Umulewe, Umuchima and Ntueke in the area. Urashi Waterfall Orashi River takes off as a stream, from the rocks, at the base of a waterfall, 183 m above mean sea level, in the Urashi enclave of Ezeama in Dikenafai, Imo State. The entrance to the waterfall was around the corner from Ezeama, the Water God's altar. \\"It was a narrow, unassuming pathway cut into the thicket of the forest. From the pathway, one could hear the steady rush of water growing louder as one drew near. A gentle mist hung in the air; a sweet combination of salty rainwater mixed with the smell of fresh wet earth. The pathway, which was less than a quarter of a mile long, soon gave way to a clear opening and there suddenly the waterfall appeared, a breathtaking view, like a huge strike of lightning on a bright summer day\\", described Nema Obih. Flow From Dikenafai, Orashi flows through several towns, including Urualla, Akokwa, Okija, Orsu, Ukpor, Ihiala, Uli, Oguta, Osemotor, Omoku, Obiakpo, Ebocha, Ukodu, Okarki, Mbiama and Epie. The river forms tributaries along its flow, from Imo through Anambra, Rivers to Bayelsa, before empting onto the Altlantic. It splits into two at Egbema. The larger portion (right), continued the flow through Eluku before splitting further into two and emptying its waters and sediments at Edi Kalama (Degema) and Abonnema into the gulf of Biafra. Economy Orashi region is in the rainforest zone, southeastern Nigeria. Crop cultivation, Oil Palm and fishing are the major occupation of the people and source of livelihood. The zone may be termed an ‘oil palm bush.’ The forest zone is characterized by abundance of plant species, sometimes exceeding 150 different species per hectare. From its source down to the Atlantic, the river supports several fishermen and provides means of liveli-hood for their families. Orashi Region, which includes Njaba River basin, holds over 35% of the oil wells in the Niger Delta states of Imo and Rivers. Trade Route and Waterway Orashi river as an ancient trade and cultural route, has provided means of transportation and migration for indigenous communities who moved from one town to another by canoe for cultural, social or economic purposes on market days. To improve inland waterways in Nigeria, the Federal Government approved the dredging of the Orashi River from Oguta Lake in Imo State to Degema in Rivers State. The project which was awarded to Simidia S and I International Company in May 2012 was to be completed in 12 months.

He subsequently testified before the Senate Banking Committee that eliminating the penny would “impose a significant and regressive rounding ‘tax’ on the American public”. He has also said that eliminating the penny would have especially adverse effects on people without checking accounts.

Dougherty (September 3, 1860 – August 1, 1924) was an officer in the Pennsylvania Army National Guard. He attained the rank of major general as commander of the 28th Infantry Division. Early life Charles Bowman Dougherty was born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania on September 3, 1860. He was educated in Wilkes-Barre and attended Emerson Institute in Washington, D.C. As an adult, his name was often abbreviated \\"C. Bow. Dougherty\\", and he was called \\"Bow\\". Business career Dougherty spent his entire career with the Susquehanna Coal Company and its successor companies, advancing through the corporate ranks to become chief clerk, purchasing agent, and then assistant manager. Military career In 1881 he enlisted in the Pennsylvania National Guard's 9th Regiment (now the 109th Field Artillery). He advanced through the enlisted ranks to sergeant major before receiving his commission as a first lieutenant in 1887. He advanced through the officer ranks to become regimental commander in 1897 with the rank of colonel.Genealogical and Family History, p. 166 Dougherty commanded the 9th Regiment when it was federalized for the Spanish–American War in 1898, and continued in command after returning to Pennsylvania. During the war he also served twice as commander of 3rd Brigade, 3rd Division, III Corps. In 1901 he was appointed commander of the Pennsylvania National Guard's 3rd Brigade as a brigadier general.

Plot Young and carefree Michael Maddy helps run Interlochen Center for the Arts for his ill father. A burlesque performer in a skimpy costume, Toodles LaVerne, impresses him with her voice, enough so that Michael makes and wins a wager with opera-company publicist George Thomas that she's good enough to sing professionally. The joint is raided and entertainer Madie Duvalle is arrested by the police, but Toodles gets away with Michael's help. He enrolls her in the music camp over the objections of Sylvia Worth, his efficiency expert, and other campers partly because of Toodles's appearance and also because she can't even read music. Michael and George scrub off the stage makeup over Toodles's objections, whereupon she sings a number that impresses everyone at camp. Michael wants her to audition for a New York City opera house. Madie, out of jail now, does a magazine story about Toodles' past life. The music camp's appalled financial backers pull their funds and their students. In the end, though, Michael manages to get Toodles in front of the opera company, where she wins everyone's approval.

Georges-Joseph Ranque was born in Ambérieu- en-Bugey, France in 1898.Biographical information from: * La legende dorée (The golden legend) (in French). Includes photograph of Ranque. * La lettre des Amis de Montluçon, 17 April 2009 (in French). His father, Léon-Joseph Ranque, worked as an engineer for a railroad; his mother was Joséphine Saint Germain. Georges attended the St. Louis lycée, where he became interested in physics. In 1918, he was admitted to the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris, where he studied physics. Subsequently he did post-graduate work at the Conservatoire des Arts-et-Métiers. For six years he had been interested in the operation of the Pantone carburetor.See: Moteur Pantone in French Wikipedia. This led him, in turn, to the study of vortices. In 1922, he was trying to develop an industrial vacuum pump for vacuuming iron filings. While studying the flow of air through the pump, he inserted a cone at one end of a tube in which air was flowing in the form of a vortex, and he noticed what is now called the “Ranque effect”; namely, that a stream of air could be split into two streams, one of hot air and the other of cold air. In 1931, he filed for a patent on his vortex tube, and in 1933, he presented a paper on it.Georges Joseph Ranque, “Method and apparatus for obtaining from a fluid under pressure two currents of fluids at different temperatures,” U.S. Patent no. 1,952,281 (filed: December 6, 1932 ; issued: March 27, 1934).Georges Joseph Ranque (1933) “Experiences sur la détente giratoire avec production simultanes d’un echappement d’air chaud et d’un echappement d’air froid” (Experiments on vorticial expansion with the simultaneous production of an outflow of hot air and an outflow of cold air), Journal de Physique et le Radium, Supplement, 7th series, 4 : 112S-114S. In 1923, Ranque went to work for the Saint-Jacques steelworks in Montluçon, where he improved methods of producing steel. He became head of the metallurgical laboratory at Saint-Jacques, where he helped develop steels that would be used as armor in tanks and in the Maginot line. In 1926, he married Eugénie Pierre in la Chapelaude. The couple had six children: Marie-Josèphe, Pierre, Marie-Noëlle, Marie-Thérèse, Monique and Marie-France.Geni.com, genealogical Web site. (Includes photograph of Georges Ranque.) During the Second World War, he developed steels and alloys that would later be used by the aviation industry. After the war, he accepted a position at the Aubert et Duval steelworks in les Ancizes. There, as director of the metallurgical laboratory, he developed alloys for aviation. In 1972, he published a book on the search for the philosopher’s stone, La Pierre philosophale.Georges-Joseph Ranque, La Pierre philosophale (Paris, France: Robert Laffont, 1972).

It was written by series showrunner Noah Hawley alongside Steve Blackman and directed by Adam Arkin. The episode first aired on December 7, 2015, and was seen by 1.31 million viewers. The episode was notable for the controversial appearance of a UFO during its climax, which served as a culmination of numerous UFO-related references recurring throughout the season. \\"The Castle\\" was acclaimed by critics, who praised its script, acting performances, and the climactic action sequence at the end.  Plot  Lou and Hank call in the South Dakota State Police after recapturing the Blumquists. When Ed reveals his upcoming rendezvous with Milligan at Sioux Falls, State Police Captain Cheney hatches a dangerous scheme for him and Peggy to wear a wire for the meeting. Cheney has Lou escorted out of the state after strongly opposing the idea, though Hank stays behind. The Blumquists agree to the plan for lesser charges, and the police set up an ambush at the motel meeting spot. Hanzee lies to Floyd and Bear by claiming Dodd is being held inside the motel by the Kansas City mob. Meanwhile, Lou stops at the gas station to call home, unaware his wife has collapsed, then discovers that Hanzee killed the attendant. Lou rushes to warn the others, and arrives to find the Gerhardts on the offensive against Cheney and his team. All but Ben and a wounded Hank are dead. Floyd realizes Hanzee's deception when one of the Gerhardt men desperately exclaims \\"They're cops!\\", and as she turns to confront him, he stabs her to death. Bear attacks and attempts to strangle Lou. A UFO appears in the midst of the chaos, distracting Bear and allowing Lou to fatally shoot him. The Blumquists flee the premises, pursued closely by Hanzee. Hank tells Lou to pursue the trio as police reinforcements arrive. Milligan and Gale Kitchen arrive upon the scene of the massacre and promptly leave. As the episode ends, the UFO's lights are seen flashing in the sky.  Production  \\"The Castle\\" opens with the depiction of a fictional book titled \\"The History of True Crime in the Midwest,\\" in which the events of both the film and the series are suggested to take place. The book is accompanied with a narration by Martin Freeman, who starred in the series' first season as Lester Nygaard. Hawley explained his idea for the book during season 1 itself, saying: \\"I like the idea that somewhere out there is a big, leather-bound book that's the history of true crime in the Midwest, and the movie was Chapter 4, Season 1 was Chapter 9 and [season 2] is Chapter 2. ... You can turn the pages of this book, and you just find this collection of stories. ... But I like the idea that these things are connected somehow, whether it's linearly or literally or thematically. That's what we play around with.\\" The episode features the \\"Massacre at Sioux Falls,\\" an event that has been foreshadowed since the first season. In the season 1 episode \\"A Fox, a Rabbit, and a Cabbage,\\" Lou Solverson recounts to Lorne Malvo a case he encountered in 1979: The season 2 premiere \\"Waiting for Dutch\\" opens with a scene depicting the filming of a fictional film titled \\"Massacre at Sioux Falls,\\" in which an actor portraying a Native American waits for Ronald Reagan to arrive on set. Prior to the episode, commentators drew attention to a real-life homicide that occurred at Sioux Falls in 1973, in which three men impersonating police officers shot and killed four male teenagers, while a fifth victim claimed to have been sexually assaulted by one of the perpetrators. The episode's telling of the events bears little resemblance to the 1973 crime, and instead depicts a massive shootout at the fictional Motor Hotel between the South Dakota State Police, members of the Gerhardt family, Lou, Hank, and Hanzee Dent. Hawley told Entertainment Weekly that the Sioux Falls massacre was decided as a plot point early in the production of the second season, and that the intention was to subvert audience expectations of which characters would play key roles. \\"We wanted to do it in an organic way that would bring these characters into collision. Certainly the characters who survived long enough to collide are not the ones you thought would survive, or the ones you thought would be the big players. I don’t think anybody thought Hanzee (Zahn McClarnon) would be the driving force into our endgame, which is very exciting. ... We also set up all three parties to collide, but the reality is Mike Milligan (Bokeem Woodbine) doesn’t even make it there. ... I’m very attracted the idea of unpredictability. If you make your characters real characters and set them in motion, they’re not always going to end up where the audience thinks they’ll end up.\\" Appearance of the UFO \\"The Castle\\" features the appearance of a UFO at the end of its climax; while Bear Gerhardt strangles Lou nearly to death, the hovercraft suddenly appears directly above them giving Lou the opportunity to kill a distracted Bear. Before the episode, the season had included numerous references to UFOs to reflect the popularity of conspiracy theories in the 1970s, though most were vague or subtly placed in the background. Compared to a prior appearance in the season premiere, the UFO is less ambiguous and bears direct consequence on the events that occur. It also receives direct acknowledgement twice: once when Peggy tells Ed that it's \\"just a flying saucer\\" and that they have to leave, and again in the season finale \\"Palindrome\\" when Lou admits that his police report would be considered implausible if he were to mention being saved by a \\"spacecraft.\\" Hawley later confirmed that it was indeed a UFO: \\"There were some people [at the network] who wanted the UFO to be shot in a way so that it could have actually been a balloon. My feeling was always, 'No, it’s a UFO. It is what it is.'\\" The UFO's appearance provoked discussion and controversy among critics and fans alike, some of whom criticized the moment as a \\"deus ex machina\\" and considered the literal inclusion of a science fiction device to be inappropriate for the series. Hawley elaborated on the scene in interviews and explained some of its influences, which included the Coen brothers' 2002 film The Man Who Wasn't There as well as the real-life 1979 Val Johnson incident in which a Minnesota deputy sheriff claimed to have encountered a UFO. Hawley stated that the idea of \\"accept[ing] the mystery,\\" which he called a \\"staple of the Coen Bros. philosophy in their films,\\" guided his decision to include a UFO in Fargo. Additionally, he said that the UFO represents the series' false claim of being \\"based on a true story\\", which to Hawley offers a commentary on the nature of how history is retold: \\"It’s not just that truth is stranger than fiction, it’s that what we call truth is a small part of the historic picture. There are so many elements that usually get weeded out of the story so you can have a simpler narrative.\\" In a later interview, Hawley named the original 1996 film as an inspiration for the UFO; namely, the scene with Mike Yanagita, which serves no purpose in the film's plot yet exists both as a character moment and as a representation of its apparent \\"realism.\\"  Reception =Ratings The episode first aired on December 7, 2015, and was watched by 1.31 million viewers. This was a drop of approximately 0.01 million viewers from the previous week's episode, \\"Loplop.\\" Critical reception \\"The Castle\\" was acclaimed by critics, who praised the writing, acting, directing, and the episode's climax. The episode currently holds a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with the consensus reading \\"With \\"The Castle,\\" Fargo delivers a penultimate episode that is both explosive and contemplative, setting the stage for a humdinger of a finale.\\" IGN's Terri Schwartz gave the episode a 9.8 out of 10, believing that the episode lived up to the anticipation of its violent climax, with particular praise towards how it handled the fate of the Gerhardts. Schwartz responded positively to the UFO scene, stating \\"I didn't expect Fargo to go all the way with its extra-terrestrial storyline even though I was hoping it would, but it seems each season of this show is going to include one sequence that can't quite be explained and deeply roots this story in fiction. Last year was the fish falling from the sky, and this year is a flying saucer. The parallel between such an inexplicable burst of violence unfolding the same night as an inexplicable sight like an alien spacecraft makes this a somber touch on an otherwise incredible sequence.\\" She also praised Kirsten Dunst's performance as Peggy during the episode's ending. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an A grade, complimenting \\"how well this episode delivers on the promises it’s been making from the start without sacrificing its interest in absurdity.\\" He felt that all the events of the season leading up to the episode demonstrated that \\"Hawley has, beneath all the artifice he delights in putting on (and which makes the show such a pleasure to watch), a good grasp on the vagaries of human behavior.\\" Handlen also praised the inclusion of the UFO as consistent with the rest of the season's storytelling, saying: \\"Everything here makes sense, more or less, but it’s also bizarre and loopy and easily preventabl[e], and it cost people their lives. Which is why the UFO is entirely fitting. It’s the nonsense given a physical presence, like some cold, unknowable god observing us from afar. There’s certainly stuff to unpack symbolically, but what struck me most powerfully in the moment is how inevitable it felt, how of a piece with everything that came before. (...) It offers no information, no explanation for itself or anything around it; it spares no one, and gives nothing but light, confusion, and mystery. It is, in short, just another part of the whole damn mess, (...) as of right now, I think Hawley has earned the device.\\" Ben Travers of Indiewire felt that the UFO functioned as a metaphor for an \\"all- knowing force from above looking down in judgment\\" at the series' events, and that the use of aliens (as opposed to God) conveyed this theme more fittingly as it \\"represented the paranoia of the post-Vietnam era.\\" Additionally, Travers considered the acknowledgment within the episode of Hanzee Dent's mysterious motives signified the writers themselves \\"pleading ignorance via a less than omniscient narrator,\\" though he felt that the decision not to speak for a Native American character was \\"respectful to a point of view undoubtedly foreign to any white man.\\" He went on to praise Zahn McClarnon's performance as Hanzee, as well as those of Jean Smart and Patrick Wilson. Joanna Robinson of Vanity Fair called the episode the series' \\"most ambitious hour yet,\\" and pointed out similarities between the UFO scene and the use of supernatural elements in both the series' first season and in prior work from the Coen brothers, including The Man Who Wasn't There, O Brother, Where Art Thou?, and A Serious Man. She praised the episode for realizing various recurring references throughout the season. Conversely, Scott Tobias of The New York Times criticized both the UFO scene and the use of the narration, stating: \\"Between the U.F.O. and the framing device, “The Castle” was a prime — and unfortunately timed — example of the show's weakness for being too clever by half. Mr. Hawley and his team have gotten more confident in both the plotting and the direction of “Fargo” this season, but all that swagger can spill over into excess. Sometimes less is more, even on a show this extravagantly stylized.\\" References External links  * Fargo (TV series) episodes 2015 American television episodes ","title":"The Castle (Fargo)"},{"id":"48493171","text":"Neville Read Hudson (10 October 1923 - 29 July 1980) was an Australian politician.

It was designed by John Hitch and built from 1950 to 1955. It is also known as District Court, Queensland Government Savings Bank, Commonwealth Bank, Magistrate's Court, Police Court, and Supreme Court. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Rockhampton Courthouse complex comprises the Supreme Court building (Block D 1886–87), Magistrate's Court building (Block B, former Police Court building 1934–1936), District Court building (Block C, former Queensland Government Savings Bank and Commonwealth Bank, 1915–16 and 1932–1933), Family Services' building (Block F, former Labour Bureau 1934–36), and the Bolsover Street Government Office building (Block E 1950–55), which all form part of a significant group of buildings on the Government Reserve bounded by Fitzroy, East and Bolsover Streets, Rockhampton. The buildings all reflect the involvement of the Queensland Government in the development of the City of Rockhampton from the colonial period until the present day, in various areas such as the administration of justice, and the provision of government services within Rockhampton. After the short lived Canoona gold rush of 1858, Rockhampton was proclaimed as a town and declared a \\"port of entry\\" in 1858. The first sale of town allotments was held in Rockhampton on 17 and 18 November 1858. In 1859 Queensland separated from New South Wales, and at this time Brisbane became the base of the Supreme Court of Queensland. The Supreme Court provided sittings for circuit towns that included Ipswich, Drayton and Maryborough. Rockhampton became a circuit town for the Supreme Court in 1863. In 1859 residents had petitioned for the provision of a court house in the new town. A site for a court house had been reserved fronting onto Quay Street in 1859–1860. However, community agitation was responsible for the establishment of a more central reserve for a court house and lock up on five acres of land bounded by Bolsover, East and Fitzroy Streets. It was on this central reserve that the court houses of Rockhampton were to be built.  Original Court House (Block A, demolished 1978)  A court house was built in 1861–1862 on the corner of East and Fitzroy Streets. The total cost of the building was £1,130. The architect was Charles Tiffin (1833–73), who also designed such notable buildings as Parliament House in Brisbane, the Old Courthouse in Ipswich, and Old Government House in Brisbane. The completed two-storeyed building was constructed of masonry and had an L-shape plan. The building was described as being of arcaded Italianate style. Valances to both levels were constructed as timber framed segmental arches, and a single-storeyed court room was provided, with ancillary spaces. Stables and associated outbuildings were also provided. Bowen had been made the home of the northern district Court in 1874. Rockhampton therefore had to be served by a judge on circuit from Brisbane. In 1881 a larger and more substantial Bowen Courthouse was erected, which caused anger amongst the citizens of Rockhampton, who felt that Rockhampton was deserving of the appointment of its own judge, and the establishment of a Supreme Court. The first Rockhampton Court House served the community of Rockhampton until the 1880s. At this time the discovery of gold at Mount Morgan, in the Dee Range some forty kilometres from Rockhampton, transformed the town. A major building boom occurred in Rockhampton as the wealth of the mine was shipped through the river port. As the boom was to continue into the early part of the twentieth century, the wealth generated was to create other major forms of public buildings in Rockhampton. These included the Rockhampton Customs House, Rockhampton Post Office, and the 1887 Supreme Court building. The Tiffin Court House was replaced with an even more imposing building for the Court in 1887. The Tiffin Court House continued to serve as a Court building and then administration office building until 1969, when new purpose built offices were provided for the State Government in East Street. The Tiffin Court House was demolished in 1978.  Supreme Court Building (Block D, 1886-87)  Rockhampton Supreme Court, corner East and Fitzroy Streets, Rockhampton, circa 1890 The booming economy of the Rockhampton region was to find an expression of its wealth in the public buildings constructed in the period of 1885–1910. An example of this is the Supreme Court building. With the growth in population in Rockhampton and central Queensland, the Tiffin- designed court house was found to be inadequate to the demands being placed on it by the community. A petition had been put before the Minister for Works in October 1882, for a new Supreme Court house for Rockhampton. The Morning Bulletin, 4 October 1882 envisaged a \\"handsome capacious edifice in the northern part of the town... two storey's high, of Stanwell sandstone\\". To accommodate the increased needs of the judiciary a replacement court house was under design in the period of 1884. The architect of the second Court building was John James Clark, (1838-1915). Clark had been born in Liverpool in England, and attended the Collegiate Institute in Liverpool, where he was trained in architectural drawing. In 1853 his family emigrated to Victoria during the gold rush era. Clark had begun his career as an architect with the Office of the Victorian Colonial Architect. In 1881 he moved to New South Wales where he designed the Town Halls for Orange and Waverley in Sydney. In 1883 Clark was appointed Queensland Colonial Architect. His best known public building was the Brisbane Treasury Building designed in 1883. Clark was dismissed from the Office of Colonial Architect in 1885. During the period that he was Colonial Architect Clark was responsible for the design of several Court Houses in Queensland including Charters Towers Courthouse, Mackay Courthouse, and the Rockhampton Court House (1885–87). He was also responsible for other notable public buildings throughout Queensland, such as the Yungaba Immigration Centre in Brisbane, Townsville Post Office and following his dismissal was responsible for the design of the Lady Norman Wing, Brisbane Children's Hospital, and the Townsville railway station. The sketch design was heavily criticised by local members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, as well as by the Rockhampton Police Magistrate. Both criticised the new court house design as not allowing for a multiplying population of Rockhampton. The design was also criticised as not providing enough office space, and appearing to be designed more for a country court house than for a growing major centre of population. Revised drawings were prepared as a result of these complaints. Initially the proposal had been made to locate the new court house building on the Rockhampton immigration depot, away from the reserve on East Street. Clark's design for the riverfront court house was to be basically unchanged when the new building's location was changed to sit adjacent to the 1861–1862 court house on the Government Reserve, away from Quay Street. Pressure was brought to bear on the Minister for Works to relocate the court house to the centre of Rockhampton from various groups, including the Chamber of Commerce. It was felt by such groups that the new court house should stand at a site close to the centre of town, and therefore help to improve the appearance of the town centre. The result of such pressure saw the court house located to its present place, in the centre of the reserve for government buildings. Tenders were called for the construction of the new court house on 8 October 1885. Thomas Matthews was awarded the contract, for a total of £12,533. The tender documents also called for an alternate price should the whole external fabric of the building be constructed in stone. The option was not taken up. The tender was approved on 11 December 1885. Construction took eighteen months. The 1887 Annual Report of the Department of Public Works announced: > Completed, under contract with T. Matthews, for the sum of exclusive of > furnishings, of £12,533. This building is two storey's in height, built of > brick, cemented, the front being of freestone. On the first floor is > provided the court, with judge's, jury, witness, and other rooms. In the > basement is provided strong room, prisoner's cell, and general office's for > the transaction of Court business. The Court House was further described in the Brisbane Courier of January 1893 as being a \\"gloomy, sombre looking\\" building. The first half yearly sitting of the Circuit Court was held in September 1887, but there was no official dedication ceremony. This was a further slight to the residents of Rockhampton, who were now advocating for the appointment of a Supreme Court Judge. The new Court House was still to be served from Brisbane. A second judge was appointed to the northern district in 1889, however the home of the Northern Court was relocated at that time from Bowen to Townsville. The Rockhampton Courthouse became the focus of both state and national attention in May 1891, as a result of the shearer's strike of February–March of that year. Early in 1891 the central Queensland towns of Barcaldine, Clermont, Winton and Springsure had been the centre points of the strike, which had arisen over the signing of agreements between pastoralists and members of unions representing the interests of bush workers. Police, volunteer members of the Queensland armed forces and Special Constables had been despatched from Rockhampton, Brisbane and other centres to the central Queensland pastoral districts. Shearers formed themselves into large camps, at Capella, Clermont and Barcaldine. The government pressed for a judicial solution to the strike and proceeded to arrest strike leaders in March 1891. Most of those arrested were acquitted; however fourteen shearers alleged to have been strike leaders, were charged with conspiracy. The conspiracy trial was held in the Rockhampton Court House in May 1891. Twelve were found guilty and sentenced to three years prison. Unable to succeed through direct strike action, the labour movement was to seek social reform and change through political methods, the result of which was the formation of the Labor Party. The party began contesting parliamentary seats in 1893. The Court House was finally elevated to the status of having a resident Supreme Court judge in 1896. This was a result of the passing of The Supreme Court Act of 1895. Five Supreme Court judges were appointed, three in Brisbane and one each in Rockhampton and Townsville. The Central Supreme Court was established in January 1896. The Police Magistrates Court was forced to relocate back to the Tiffin-designed court house. It was not until 1935 that a purpose building was to be provided for the Police Court. The interior of the building was carpeted in 1896. In 1908 a new strong room was provided on the ground floor of the building, which lead to the removal of a staircase. A wall was also removed in the titles and stamps office to open up the existing office space, and a new counter was provided for dealing with the public. Further alterations were made to the building in 1922, with the removal of a brick wall in what had been the Clerk Petty Sessions General Office. Concrete steps were provided on to a verandah on the northern side of the building. Other partitions were removed to open out space, and windows were installed. Other alterations were made to the building in 1933 in association with the provision of sewering the entire site, and the construction of the adjacent toilet block. A toilet, bath and wash basins were provided on the upper storey for the Judge's room, and the jury room. The Supreme Court building at the present time contains the Supreme Court, Supreme/District Court Registry, Legal Library, and associated ancillary services for the staff and general public. Since the Central Supreme Court was inaugurated in 1896, it has remained the only Supreme Court in residence in Queensland in its original setting and building. The Brisbane Supreme Court building, designed by FDG Stanley in 1879, burnt down in 1968. The Northern Supreme Court in Townsville, relocated from Bowen in 1889, moved into an adapted School of Arts, and was provided with a purpose built Court House in 1975. The Rockhampton Court House is the only one to maintain its connection with its place of inauguration. Although designed as a Court House for the Brisbane Circuit, it was intended for it to be the home of a Supreme Court.  District Court (Block C, 1915-16, 1932-33)  A Rockhampton branch of the Queensland Queensland Government Savings Bank was first proposed in 1914. Tenders for the erection of a new building to be built on the government reserve closed on 28 June 1914. In 1915 construction began on the new Queensland Government Savings Bank. £2,685 was allocated by the State Government for the construction of the Savings Bank. The design of the Queensland Government Savings Bank was supervised by Alfred Barton Brady and Thomas Pye of the Works Department. AB Brady and Thomas Pye were also responsible for overseeing other notable buildings in Rockhampton, including the Customs House. The completion date was expected to be 1916. The building of the Queensland Government Savings Bank was the first major construction work undertaken on the Government Reserve since the erection of the Supreme Court building in 1885–1887. The bank building was to be one of the few purpose built Queensland Government Savings Bank buildings in Queensland. Other Government Savings Banks were also built in Brisbane and Toowoomba. The Brisbane Office, constructed on the corner of George and Elizabeth Streets, was completed in the period of 1914–1922. It survives at the present time as the Family Services Building. The construction of the Queensland Government Savings Bank was a result of the initiative of the Ted Theodore Government. State enterprises were to be an important element of the social and political platforms of the Labor Party. This included intervention in the economy, especially through the provision of a wide range of products to allow for lower prices for goods and services. The Queensland Government Savings Bank had been formed in 1916 with the amalgamation of the Government Savings Bank, Agricultural Bank and the Workers Dwelling Board under The Queensland Government Savings Bank Act 1916. The new bank would compete in the economy utilising the same market approach as the private banks. The Queensland Government Savings Bank functioned as a separate financial identity until 1920, when the businesses and assets of the State Bank were transferred over to the Commonwealth Bank. Under this transfer to Commonwealth control, the state was to be able to borrow larger funds from the Commonwealth body. The Commonwealth Bank took possession of the building in 1920, relocating from the previous rented premises at 74 East Street in Rockhampton. In the 1930s there was a demand for enlarged and improved accommodation for the Commonwealth Bank in Rockhampton. The building was considerably enlarged in the 1932–1933 period. The expansion of the Commonwealth Bank building added new facades to the exterior. An air-conditioning plant room was added in 1975. The building continued as a banking establishment until 1986 when it was purchased by the State Government, to alleviate overcrowding. The building was converted to house the District Court and associated staff, and general facilities for the use of the public and staff members of the Court.  Magistrate's Court (Block B 1934-36)  With the enlarging and extending of the former Queensland Government Savings Bank being completed, an additional Court building was constructed by the Queensland Government. The new Police Court building design was part of a projected townscape of buildings on the Government Reserve, to complement the design of the Commonwealth Bank building. The Police Court building was also built in response to the impact of the depression on the local community. The construction of the building was viewed as one of three possible projects to alleviate the unemployment problem in Rockhampton, decided on by a committee consisting of the ALP, Unions, and unemployed workers. A deputation from the committee to the Attorney General led to the approval being given for construction of the building in late 1933. The local Labor member for Rockhampton, James Larcombe, MLA, was an ardent supporter of the initiative. The facade of the new Court was designed specifically to complement the Commonwealth Bank building. Construction of the building was begun in 1934 and completed in 1936. The Annual Report for the Department of Public Works, 1934 gave the following description: > This building, which will be of concrete and brick construction with cement > finish externally and tile roof, will provide accommodation for the Police > Court and officials connected therewith. The main facade, facing East > street, is designed with portico to match the neighbouring building of the > Commonwealth Bank, and together with the Supreme Court, should complete a > pleasing architectural group... accommodation will be provided for the Clerk > of Petty Sessions and his staff, together with strong rooms, and also the > Police Magistrate.... In rear approached from entrance drive to the Supreme > Court, will be situated the new court room... with verandahs on either side > and at rear, and with rooms for solicitors and witnesses... Altogether, the > building when completed, should be an asset to the already long list of > handsome buildings erected in this city. Estimated cost of construction was to be £7,825. The colour for the Police Court building was also chosen so as to blend in with the Commonwealth Bank. At the same time new police buildings and courthouses were being erected in Mackay, Dalby and Toowoomba. The Police Court was accommodated in this building until being altered to its present arrangement as a Magistrate's Court in 1991.  Family Services' Building (Block F 1934-36)  The present Family Services' building was constructed as part of the project to provide employment in Queensland through the capital works building programme of the Forgan-Smith government. The Department of Public Works described the new building as being part of a continuing development of the Supreme Court site designed and constructed in sympathy with the neighbouring Commonwealth Bank building: > This building, of brick and concrete construction, with tile roof, will > replace the existing wood and brick structure, and provide central > accommodation for officials of the Department of Labour and Industry. > Architecturally, it is treated in a similar manner to the Police Court now > under construction in East street. The building will accommodate Labour > Agent, General Office, Clerks, Female Labour Agent, Travelling inspector, > and will have necessary lavatory accommodation. Estimated cost of construction was to be £4,584. Work began in 1934 and was completed in 1936. The Labour Bureau was constructed to be one of two buildings designed to front onto Bolsover Street. The design was by the Queensland Department of Public Works under the control of Andrew Baxter Leven (1885-1966). Leven at this period was Chief Architect and Quantity Surveyor for the Department of Works, a position he held from 1933 until 1951. The Labour Bureau building was sited so as to provide a court related to the rear facade of the Supreme Court building. The second building, intended to complement the Labour Bureau building was not constructed. Additional offices for the Bureau were to be eventually included in the Bolsover Street Government Offices. All of the public buildings on the Supreme Court site were further modernised with the installation of a sewerage system in 1933.  Bolsover Street Government Office Building (Block E 1950-55)  Construction of the Bolsover Street Government Office building was necessitated by the increased accommodation requirements of various Government Departments in Rockhampton after the Second World War, partly as a result of a policy of decentralisation. Previously, accommodation was supplied by a two storeyed former fire station on the Government Reserve. However, it was felt that this accommodation was not appropriate or in keeping with the remainder of public buildings on the Supreme Court site . Shortages of building materials, as well as architects and technical officers to design and supervise building works, were experienced in the post-war years. The Bolsover Street Government Office building was designed in 1949 by English architect Harold John Hitch (known as John Hitch), and the building was constructed from 1950 to 1955. After working with well known firms in the United Kingdom and service with the R.A.F. John Hitch (b. 26 June 1915), and his Danish wife, emigrated to Australia to take up a position with the Architectural Branch of the Queensland Public Works Department in Brisbane on 6 February 1948. Hitch had qualified in London in 1938, and after the war in 1946 had spent approximately 12 weeks in Denmark and Sweden, and had seen some of what he considered the best pre-war Scandinavian architecture which would have a strong influence on his architectural aesthetic and design philosophy. John Hitch was one of approximately six British architects, appointed by the Queensland Government for a 3-year contract, who arrived with their families during 1947–1948. The Queensland Government paid for passage and relocation costs, and initially accommodation was provided at the Yungaba Immigration Depot, Kangaroo Point. Several of these architects broke their contracts and moved interstate or back to the United Kingdom due to dissatisfaction with their conditions of professional appointment, and living and climatic conditions. In March 1950 Hitch was promoted to Designing Architect Division 1, a position he held until he resigned in April 1951 after completing his three-year contract to set up practice with Theo Thynne. In 1954 Hitch established an independent practice, and was commissioned to design a new Court House for Bundaberg, constructed 1956–1957, which was described in 1957 Annual Report of the Department of Public Works as: > A stone building which captures the quality, dignity and prestige expected > in a court-house building and yet remains essentially a product of the > present day. Hitch was also appointed to the staff of the Architecture School of the University of Queensland as a part-time lecturer in c.1949. At this time, the school was located adjacent to Parliament House in George Street, Brisbane, and classes were held in the evenings and comprised University and Technical College students. Eventually the school separated with its move to the St Lucia campus in May 1956. Hitch had also lectured on the influence of Scandinavian design on British architecture to members of the R.A.I.A. Brisbane Chapter. In 1956 Hitch entered private practice with Ian Sinnamon, working on a variety of civic and commercial buildings. He also played a prominent role within the Queensland Chapter of the R.A.I.A. until he moved to Melbourne in 1958, where remained for the rest of his career. As a member of the publications committee of the Queensland Chapter of the R.A.I.A., Hitch was involved in the publication of Buildings of Queensland, published by Jacaranda Press in 1959 as a centennial record of architecture in Queensland. Hitch was also responsible for the design and construction of a demountable travelling exhibition which displayed the activities of the Public Works Department, conceived as a bold public relations exercise. It was first displayed at the Royal National Show, and was later transported by rail to regional centres. Other exhibitions designed by Hitch include three Queensland Industries Fairs from 1949, the 1952 R.A.I.A. Convention in Brisbane City Hall, and the Architecture in Australia exhibition at the Royal Institute of British Architects, Portland Place, London from 28 February to 24 March 1956. For the Bolsover Street site, John Hitch obtained through chief engineer Mr Kindler site survey information including flood level projections used for the construction of the nearby Fitzroy River Bridge. Hitch designed three schemes for submission to the Queensland Cabinet, the first being a ten-storey tower fronting Fitzroy Street, the second being two four to five storey blocks facing East and Bolsover Streets, and the third being a three-storey U-shaped development fronting the three streets. The first and third schemes emphasised the Queensland Government presence on the approach to the new Fitzroy River Bridge. Cabinet opted for the larger site coverage of the third smaller scaled alternative, and approval was given to proceed with one wing to the Bolsover Street frontage. A model of the U-shaped development was constructed, which John Hitch believes was the first architectural model in Queensland. The office block replaced an earlier scheme for a second stage of building intended for the Labour Bureau. The first stage had been the adjacent 1934–1936 Labour Bureau building. The Government Office building was constructed as the first wing of a proposed U-shaped building, with frontages to Bolsover, Fitzroy and East Streets, which would have established a courtyard around the Supreme Court house while maintaining the axial vistas to Bolsover and East Streets. In 1950 work commenced on the three-storeyed building, which was constructed of reinforced concrete with brick and stone facings. Estimated cost of the building was to be £175,000. Due to site conditions, reinforced concrete piers were driven to the basalt bed, and reinforced concrete perimeter beams were laid and detailed to read as a plinth to the building. The architect was not able to supervise the works, and the concrete perimeter beam was incorrectly stopped horizontally between pours. The Government policy of using direct labour on its building projects was handled entirely by the Construction Branch, and on-site visits by architects were rare and were discouraged. As a result of the faulty concrete pour, Hitch was directed to the site to arrange for the faulty work to be removed and the concrete repoured. The building was constructed with a curtain wall of metal- framed glazing with stone spandrel panels divided by regularly spaced vertical concrete aggregate fins framed by brickwork to the main street frontage. The aggregate fins were designed to have horizontal metal sunhoods which were not installed. Satisfactory progress on the work was reported in the period 1951–1953. It was anticipated that the building would be in partial occupation from the beginning of 1954, and the entire project completed by the middle of 1954. In its 1955 Annual Report, the Department of Public Works stated: > Early in the year the new block of offices in Rockhampton was completed and > relieved the accommodation problem in the city. When completed, the building was much admired by the architectural student community, providing a local example of the architectural aesthetic promoted by journals such as the Architectural Review. The building was one of the first substantial public buildings built by the Department after the Second World War, and demonstrated a radical change in design philosophy. Internal refits were carried out in 1960, 1969, 1976 and 1984, but much of the original fabric remains intact. The remaining wings of the design were not completed. The Office building supplied the needs of the various Departments in Rockhampton until 1969 when new buildings were built away from the Government Reserve.  Description  The Rockhampton Courthouse complex, containing the Supreme Court, Magistrate's Court, District Court, Family Services' building and Government Office building, is located on a level site bound on three sides by East, Fitzroy and Bolsover Streets. The site is prominently located within the city centre at the entrance to the East Street mall, and adjacent to the approach to the Fitzroy Bridge leading to North Rockhampton. The Magistrate's Court, District Court and Family Services' building have been designed in a similar architectural style.  Supreme Court  Supreme Court at Rockhampton, 1947 The Supreme Court building is a two-storeyed rendered masonry structure with a sandstone northeastern entrance facade. The building has a T-shaped plan with a corrugated iron gable roof to the front section, containing the main Court room, and a hipped roof to the rear section. The building is located towards the centre of the site, and is surrounded by the Magistrate's Court to the northeast, the District Court to the east, the Family Services' building to the southwest, and the Government Office building to the west. To the north of the building is the site for a proposed new Court facility. Supreme Court, 2009 The building is approached from the northeast via a wide pathway through an avenue of Royal Palms (Roystonea regia) between the Magistrate's Court and District Court buildings. Gates are located at the East Street entrance, which consist of four large gate posts with wrought iron central gates and an open walkway either side. A curved wrought iron palisade on a sandstone base connects the outermost gate pillars with the adjacent Magistrate's Court and District Court buildings. The northeast entrance elevation is faced with ashlar sandstone, and has a central prostyle portico to the first floor, the base of which forms the ground floor entrance. The portico has four Ionic columns, which are flanked by square columns at either side, supporting an entablature and pediment finished with dentils. Three tall sash windows, centred between the columns, are framed with pilasters, pedestal and entablature, and each is surmounted by a circular window framed with relief carving. The ground floor, forming the base to the portico, has banded rustication with a central doorway framed with a sandstone entrance canopy. The entrance is flanked by paired sash windows. The prostyle portico is flanked by lower corner sections which have a centrally located arched sash window to the first floor and a paired timber door to the ground floor.

The rear elevation has a central recessed verandah with tiled skillion awning flanked by projecting side wings. The side wings have two tall multi-paned sash windows with expressed architraves and sills, the verandah is enclosed with aluminium framed glazing, and high level glazing is located above the awning. Internally, the building has been altered quite substantially, with partition walls forming a series of offices, a security reception area, and store rooms. Original walls are rendered masonry, and most ceilings are suspended. An original section of panelled ceiling is located in the toilets in the rear of the building. Original details include architraves, skirtings and some timber panelled doors.  Government Office Building  The Government Office building is located towards the western corner of the site fronting Bolsover and Fitzroy Streets, and is surrounded by the Supreme Court to the east and the Family Services' building to the southeast. The building has an L-shaped plan, with a three- storeyed wing fronting Bolsover Street, and a four- storeyed corner section fronting Fitzroy Street. The building has a reinforced concrete frame with brick facing. The Bolsover Street elevation has a curtain wall of metal framed glazing, with polished granite spandrel panels with sandstone sills to the ground floor, which is divided by regularly spaced vertical concrete aggregate fins and which is framed by brickwork. The southern end of the Bolsover Street elevation has brickwork to the upper two floors surmounting the principal entrance, which comprises a recessed metal framed glass door with cantilevered awning accessed via an L-shaped granite stair and landing with metal balustrade. The southern end also has a narrow penthouse plantroom which is recessed from the exterior of the building, with rendered walls, and a curved roof facing Bolsover Street with a series of recessed circular details. The northern end of the elevation has a four- storeyed brickwork facade with three windows to each of the first three floors. The fourth floor partly extends above the curtain wall glazing, with a large recessed window unit and spandrel panel. A low parapet wall with sculptural copper spitters conceals a shallow pitched roof with sculptural copper ridge ventilators. The rear of the building, facing the northeast, is treated in a similar architectural manner to the Bolsover Street elevation. The southeast elevation has a brickwork facade with three recessed panels to each floor containing metal framed glazing with spandrel panels, with the ground floor having a concrete surround with sandstone faced vertical dividing panels. A recessed vertical glazing strip is located adjacent to the recessed panels, and contains metal framed glazing and spandrel panels lighting an internal staircase. An entrance is located at the ground level, with a concrete awning with copper spitter, and a cantilevered balcony with a flag pole, surmounted by a lightning conductor, and metal balustrading is located above and opens off the penthouse plantroom. The penthouse plantroom has glazing to the southeast. The northwest elevation, fronting Fitzroy Street, has a brickwork facade with regularly spaced window units to the first three floors. The fourth floor has a long recessed panel containing metal framed glazing and spandrel panels. A recessed three-storeyed section, located on the northeast side of this elevation, has metal framed glazing and spandrel panels lighting an internal staircase. This section was intended to form the linkage to a proposed wing facing Fitzroy Street which was not constructed, and its end facade has reinforced concrete framing and brick infill. The roof of the corner section has a metal balustrade and houses a large satellite dish and plant. The building has a raised plinth, with raised brick gardens with sandstone cappings located to both the Bolsover and Fitzroy Street elevations. Internally, the building has an entrance foyer with terrazzo floor at the southeast. The foyer has planter boxes to the southeast windows with polished granite facings and cappings, and marble cladding to the window reveals. The foyer is split-level, with steps leading to a raised lift foyer, with a central lift around which a terrazzo stair is located. The lift core has circular openings with metal grilles, giving a port-hole effect, and each floor has a terrazzo finished lift foyer. The penthouse plantroom is accessed via a narrow timber stair from the lift foyer below. The Bolsover Street wing is planned to have a central corridor, which is delineated by a row of columns to either side, with partitions dividing the office space. The central corridor has a lower ceiling housing a ventilation system with registers to the adjacent office space. Sections of the original partitioning system survive, with tracks for the location of partitions evident in the ceilings and walls. Toilets, stores and service rooms are located at the northwest end of the building, and have terrazzo floors and ceramic tiled walls. A second terrazzo dog-leg stair is located fronting Fitzroy Street at the northern corner of the building, with an entrance foyer with terrazzo floor. This stair has a sculptural balustrade consisting of tapered metal vertical members, shaped timber handrail, and solid vertical panels.  Grounds  The grounds contain a toilet block to the southeast of the Supreme Court. This structure has rendered masonry walls to door head height, with timber slats above to the underside of the corrugated iron hipped roof with central clerestory. The toilets have a central pedimented porch, which has been infilled with rendered masonry and glass louvres. The toilets are entered from either side by a timber door with upper lattice panel. Internally, the structure has a boarded timber ceiling, and timber framed partitions with timber doors which have upper glass panels.  Heritage listing  Architectural plans for the courthouse, circa 1888 Rockhampton Courthouse complex was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. It is significant for demonstrating the development of Rockhampton and the Government Reserve since 1861, and the provision of state government services in the City of Rockhampton and the region of central Queensland. The Supreme Court building is important in demonstrating the evolution of the judicial system in Queensland through the growth of the Circuit Court, for its association with the establishment of the Supreme Court in Queensland. The building is also a visible expression of the wealth generated by the economic boom during the 1880s as a result of the discovery of gold at Mount Morgan. The Magistrate's Court, District Court, and Family Services' buildings reflect the involvement of the Queensland Government in the development of Rockhampton, from 1915 until the present day, in various areas such as the administration of justice, and the provision of government services within Rockhampton. The buildings are significant for demonstrating the involvement of the Queensland Government, in the period of 1915–1936, in providing court and administrative services to the Rockhampton community, and in the intervention of the economy through the provision of Government financial institutions. The Magistrate's Court and Family Services' building are associated with a construction programme, undertaken by the Queensland Government during the depression era, designed to generate work to alleviate unemployment. The Government Office building is significant in demonstrating the post-war development of Rockhampton, particularly through the provision of governmental services and the introduction of multi-storeyed office accommodation. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Supreme Court building is important as the only surviving nineteenth-century Court House that has served the Supreme Court continuously since 1896. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The complex is also an important example of urban design, comprising a series of buildings dating from the 1880s to the 1950s which have been designed in a coordinated manner intended to enhance the civic centre of Rockhampton. The building is one of only three surviving courthouses designed by him in Queensland, and is important in demonstrating the planning of a nineteenth- century Supreme Court house. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Supreme Court building is of considerable architectural merit, and the form and fabric of the building illustrate a skilled design approach. The building, together with the surrounding structures, makes a significant aesthetic contribution to the local streetscape and Rockhampton townscape. The building is an important component of the civic centre of Rockhampton, and demonstrates the grand vision that the community held for Rockhampton as a future northern Capital during the late nineteenth century. The buildings and grounds have considerable aesthetic significance which, designed as pavilion structures surrounding the Supreme Court building, demonstrate a coordinated design approach intended to enhance the civic centre of Rockhampton. The buildings, together with the Supreme Court, make a significant aesthetic contribution to the local streetscape and Rockhampton townscape, and are an important component of the civic centre of Rockhampton. The structure's form, fabric and materials illustrate a skilled design approach, and the building makes an important aesthetic contribution to the local streetscape and Rockhampton townscape. The building is an important component of the civic centre of Rockhampton. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The complex has a special association with the Rockhampton community, containing some of the city's principal public buildings. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The Supreme Court building is significant as an example of the work of eminent architect John James Clark, Colonial Architect from 1883 to 1885. The Supreme Court building is also significant for its association with the shearer's strike conspiracy trial of 1891, and the Labor Party that was to subsequently evolve as a result of the trial. The Government Office building is significant as an example of the work of John Hitch, a post-war immigrant architect employed by the Department of Public Works, who made an important contribution to the post-war development of architecture in Queensland. The building is of considerable architectural significance, and when constructed was much admired by the architectural student community, providing a local example of the architectural aesthetic promoted by leading journals. The building was one of the first substantial public buildings built by the Department after the Second World War, and demonstrated a radical change in design philosophy.
