Together with its cemetery, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001 as McCanaan Missionary Baptist Church and Cemetery. The church was organized in 1875 by Rev. Frank Cooper, and a small church was built on the current church's site. Its membership included sharecroppers at the Millhaven Plantation in Screven County, Georgia. with The c.1875 church was replaced in the 1890s and the church was again rebuilt in 1912. In the early 1900s a school was built behind the church which served grades one through six. The property has a cemetery that was started in the 1930s, next to the church, after burials at a church-associated original cemetery on Millhaven Plantation (about 4.5 miles away, to the southeast) were ceased. The cemetery has \\"simple granite markers\\". Baptisms associated with the church took place in Brier Creek, about one mile to the north. In its NRHP nomination, the church was deemed significant architecturally as \\"an excellent example of a rural African-American church with a cemetery\\" in Georgia, having characteristics identified as typical for the type. It is a wood framed simple building with a church tower and a modest amount of Gothic Revival styling in its windows, gable-ends, and tower. The Millhaven Plantation was a very large operation. A history of the church at its 121st anniversary was written by church member Evelyn Williams in 1996. With assistance of Anne Floyd, a historic preservation planner, Williams completed an information form about the property for submission to Georgia's Historic Preservation Division, leading eventually to the listing of the property on the NRHP in 2001.

Kaplan Financial Education is a consortium of numerous financial services training and publishing companies providing insurance and securities licensing exam preparation, along with continuing education. It is ultimately a subsidiary of Graham Holdings Company.  History   Precursors  The origin lies in three companies founded in the early 1970s: * Blitz Schools, a training company established in 1970 by Dennis Blitz in Dearborn, Michigan, focused primarily on the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) (then NASD) Series 6 classroom training for large insurance companies. Blitz secured national contracts for Series 6 training with Prudential Insurance, New York Life, and John Hancock. * Security Schools, established by Tom Keyes, was headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota and had offices in Milwaukee, Chicago and Miami. Security Schools provided insurance, securities and real estate licensing classroom training. * DSC Publishing, located in Chicago, Illinois, was a real estate licensing training company founded by Bob Kyle. Kyle published the textbooks used in his classes and sold the materials to other schools for use in their classrooms.  1980s  In 1984, Bob Kyle pitched the idea of a national financial training and publishing business to Longman, Inc., a multibillion-dollar British publishing company owned by Pearson PLC. Pearson owned a mixture of well known brands at that time including The Times of London, Penguin Books, Madame Tussauds Wax Museum, and Lazard Frères Investment Bank, among other companies. Longman acquired Blitz Schools, Security Schools, and DSC Publishing and merged them together to create Longman Financial Services, Inc (LFSI). Prior to these acquisitions, Longman had only minor operations in the United States, and planned on using the firm as its U.S. entry. In 1985, Longman purchased R&R; Newkirk, an Indianapolis- based company that developed print products for insurance licensing and continuing education. The firm dated back to 1914 as Research and Review Service of America, a provider of insurance sales and product training. In 1960, the company acquired Newkirk and Associates, a planned giving publisher, and changed the name to R&R; Newkirk and Company.  Growth  Over the next four years, Longman acquired more than a dozen small training organizations, merging them into LFSI. These acquisitions were made to add new geographical market and/or new product lines. A mong the more notable acquisitions during this time including Fleur, Inc. and Golle & Holmes, Inc., both of which are described below: * Fleur, a securities exam prep provider, was a large acquisition that brought classroom markets in New York, California and Colorado. The owner's son, Ed Fleur, later departed the firm and formed his own organization, PassPerfect, which is a competitor of Kaplan's today. * The financial services business of Golle & Holmes, a Minneapolis-based custom writing group, brought a new securities licensing product line, PASSTRAK, into Longman and a specific product (Broker in a Box) that was a print-based self study program targeted towards large institutional firms and the NYSE sixty day training requirement. Problems arose because of the multiple locations, multiple systems, overlapping target markets, and differing philosophies, ultimately impacting profit margins and resulting in Longman looking for a way to exit the business. In 1992, Longman acquired a publisher in Boston, Addison Wesley, and sold Longman Financial Services to Bob Kyle and Dennis Blitz, who they had retained during the initial acquisitions to manage the company. Kyle and Blitz split their new company into three distinct business units: 1) Real Estate Schools, 2) Real Estate Publishing, and 3) Financial Services Training. Financial Services was consolidated from four locations into one office in Chicago, Illinois, previously acquired insurance schools in Wisconsin and Arizona were sold, and several other small schools were closed. The name of the company was changed to Dearborn Financial Publishing, which coincidentally was the street address of the company's Chicago office at that time and the name of the Detroit suburb where Blitz founded Blitz Schools.  Further growth  Blitz and Kyle made changes to the firm's product lines over the next few years, discontinuing Broker-in-a-Box and revamping Passtrak, which eventually came to represent the firm's streamlined, exam-focused product for the industry. In 1996, they started looking at compliance tracking and created DCT (an acronym for Dearborn Compliance Tracking), an internet-based system that tracked compliance hours and course approvals, as well as individual student and company programs. All financial services continued to operate under one name, Dearborn Financial Publishing, while each real estate school operated under its pre-acquisition name - each dominant within a single state.  Kaplan  In 1998, Dearborn was acquired by Kaplan, Inc. Over the next few years, Kaplan made a series of strategic acquisitions. * In early 2000, Kaplan acquired Schweser, a highly profitable organization in La Crosse, Wisconsin focused on training for the Chartered Financial Analyst designation, from Dr. Carl Schweser and Dr. Andy Temte. Schweser was the global leader in CFA exam preparation and was well known for its high-quality content and exceptional first-time pass rates. * The firm also acquired Prosource, a Minneapolis-based classroom business that was the dominant provider in real estate and insurance licensing in Minnesota as well as a large provider in insurance CE and securities exam prep. * Insurance Systems of Tennessee headquartered in Nashville, was acquired in 2004 to make Dearborn the dominant provider of insurance and securities classroom business in the state of Tennessee. * Three schools were acquired in Texas, including Leonard-Hawes, which made Dearborn the largest insurance and real estate trainer in the state. * Insurance Achievement, located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, was also purchased in 2004 to make Dearborn the largest provider of insurance professional designations exam prep products in the country. IA was founded in 1964 by Bob Rackley and provided exam prep for nearly a dozen popular insurance designations, including Chartered Life Underwriter (CLU), Chartered Financial Consultant (ChFC), and Certified Property-Casualty Underwriter (CPCU). * Saenger and Associates was purchased from its founder, Bruce Saenger, in 2004 to strengthen Dearborn's securities and insurance classroom market share in New York and surrounding states. In April 2005, Kaplan purchased BISYS Education Services, Dearborn's largest head-to-head competitor for financial services training and a large provider of licensing and compliance services to the insurance and securities industry. The education products and services were merged with Dearborn to become Kaplan Financial; the compliance group became a separate operating entity, Kaplan Compliance Solutions. In 2006, Kaplan purchased eMind, headquartered in Los Angeles, California, who provided online securities firm element training and tracking, online insurance CE, and a suite of online compliance tools.  Later developments  In early 2008, Kaplan Financial was relocated from Chicago to La Crosse, Wisconsin, the home office of Kaplan Schweser. The company was placed into the hands of Kaplan Schweser's management team, and the name was changed to Kaplan Financial Education. Kaplan Real Estate Education was also relocated to La Crosse in 2008 and these three business units were collectively managed under the name Kaplan Professional Education in 2009. In the spring of 2010, the Kaplan Compliance Solutions unit was folded back into the business and Kaplan Professional Education became Kaplan Professional. In January 2011, the Kaplan Professional business was placed within the Kaplan University family and is now known as the Kaplan University School of Professional and Continuing Education, although Kaplan Financial Education continues to operate as its own brand within this business. Kaplan Compliance Solutions was sold to Vertafore, a provider of insurance software to agents, managing general agents, and carriers in October 2011.

The operation involved the fake defection in place of a US Army sergeant based in Washington, D.C. who, in return for hundreds of thousands of dollars over two decades, provided information to the GRU as agreed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. This included over 4,000 documents on a new nerve gas the US believed unweaponizable, with the US intending to waste Soviet resources. Overview The operation began in 1959 when U.S. Army First Sergeant Joseph Edward Cassidy (1920-2011), assigned to the Army's nuclear power office near Washington, D.C., was approached (with Army permission) by the FBI. Cassidy, despite having no previous training, was able to make contact with a Soviet naval attache believed to be a spy, and set up an arrangement where he would provide information to the Soviets in exchange for money. Soviet requests for information were passed to the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, and various classified information provided as a result.Anthony Day, Los Angeles Times, 7 April 2000, \\"Cold-War Espionage Thriller Brims with the Shocking Truth\\" The principal Russian interest was in information about the US nerve gas program, and Cassidy initially established his credentials by providing genuine data from the US program.Scott Shane, Baltimore Sun, 8 July 2001, \\"Spying, though overrated, has much redeeming value\\" By 1964 he was in a position to begin pointing Soviet research towards a G-series nerve agent, GJ, which the US thought could not be produced in stable, weaponizable form. Cassidy provided over 4,000 documents on a mixture of real and non-existent research into the new gas, with the US intending to waste Soviet resources attempting to duplicate the work.Milton Leitenberg, Raymond A Zilinskas, and Jens H Kuhn (2012), The Soviet Biological Weapons Program: A History, Harvard University Press, p. 430Benjamin C.

The operation was highly classified, and when two FBI agents died in a plane crash while surveilling a Soviet spy, press and public were misled about the circumstances, and even the agents' families were told nothing for years. A similar, and arguably more significant, disinformation operation was run by the FBI via double-agent Dmitri Polyakov, feeding the Soviet Union the false information that the US was covertly continuing with its biological weapons program despite public announcements to the contrary. The disinformation could be one reasons which led the Soviet Union to expand its biological weapons program, and a near-universal belief into the 1990s among its scientists that they were mirroring US efforts.

Epimorphosis can be considered a simple model for development, though it only occurs in tissues surrounding the site of injury rather than occurring system- wide. Epimorphosis restores the anatomy of the organism and the original polarity that existed before the destruction of the tissue and/or a structure of the organism. Epimorphosis regeneration can be observed in both vertebrates and invertebrates such as the common examples: salamanders, annelidas, and planarians.  History  Thomas Hunt Morgan, an evolutionary biologist who also worked with embryology, argued that limb and tissue reformation bore many similarities to embryonic development. Building off of the work of German embryologist Wilhelm Roux, who suggested regeneration was two cooperative but distinct pathways instead of one, Morgan named the two parts of the regenerative process epimorphosis and morphallaxis. Specifically, Morgan wanted epimorphosis to specify the process of entirely new tissues being regrown from an amputation or similar injury, with morphallaxis being coined to describe regeneration that did not use cell proliferation, such as in hydra. The key difference between the two forms of regeneration is that epimorphosis involves cellular proliferation and blastema formation, whereas morphallaxis does not.  In vertebrates  The apical ectodermal ridge in embryonic development is very similar to the apical ectodermal cap in limb regeneration. The progress zone can be seen near to the zone of polarizing activity, which instructs cells on how to orient the limb. Dorsal and ventral views of a newt that has had a limb amputated and regrown, from \\"The elements of experimental embryology\\" by Julian Huxley and Gavin de Beer. In vertebrates, epimorphosis relies on blastema formation to proliferate cells into the new tissue. Through studies involving zebrafish fins, the toetips of mice, and limb regeneration in axolotls, researchers at the Polish Academy of Sciences found evidence for epimorphosis occurring in a variety of vertebrates, including instances of mammal epimorphosis.  Limb regeneration  Limb regeneration occurs when a part of an organism is destroyed, and the organism must reform that structure. The general steps for limb regeneration are as follows: epidermis covers the wound which is called the wound healing process, the mesenchyme dedifferentiates into a blastema and a apical ectodermal cap forms, and the limb re-differentiates to form the full limb.  Processes in salamanders  Epidermal cells at the wound margins migrate to cover the wound and will become the wound epidermis. No scar tissue forms, as it would in mammals. The mesenchymal tissues of the limb stump secrete matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). As the MMPs are secreted, the wound epithelium thickensand eventually becomes an apical ectodermal cap (AEC) that forms on the tip of the stump. This is similar to the embryonic apical ectodermal ridge, which forms during normal limb development. Under the AEC, the nerves near the site of the limb destroyed are degraded. The AEC causes the progress zone to re-establish; this means the cells under the AEC (including bone, cartilage, fibroblast cells, etc) dedifferentiate and become separated mesenchymal cells that form the blastema. Some tissues express specialized genes (like muscle cells) and so if there is damage to these tissues, the genes become downregulated and the proliferation genes are unregulated. The AEC also releases fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) (including FGF-4 and -8) that drive the development of the new limb, essentially resetting the limb back to its embryonic development stage. However, even though some of the limb cells are able to dedifferentiate, they are not able to fully dedifferentiate to the level of multipotent progenitor cells. During regeneration, only cartilage cells can form new cartilage tissue, only muscle cells can form new muscle tissue, and so on. The dedifferentiated cells still retain their original specification. To begin the physical formation of a new limb, regeneration occurs in a distal to proximal sequence. The distal part of the limb is established first, and then the distal part of the limb interacts with the original proximal part of the limb to form the intermediate portion of the limb known as intercalation.  In invertebrates   Periplaneta americana  The American cockroach is capable of regenerating limbs that have been damaged or destroyed, such as legs and antennae, as well parts of its compound eye. It does this with lectin—a protein made for binding proteins—named regenectin, which shares a family with other lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding proteins. Regenectin carries both a regenerative and a system defense function, and it is produced by the cockroach's paracrine system to work with muscle reformation.  Capitella teleta  C. teleta is a segmented worm found in North America that is capable of regenerating posterior segments after amputation. This regeneration uses the interaction of several sets of Hox genes, as well as blastema formation. All of the Hox genes concerned in epimorphosis are present in the abdominal area of the worm, but not in the anterior portion. However, the genes do not, themselves, direct the anterior-posterior patterning of the worm's thorax.  Planaria vitta  P. vitta is a flatworm of genus Planaria that, when needed, can draw upon both morphallaxis and epimorphosis to regrow itself; in P. vitta, epimorphosis precedes morphallaxis and lasts about ten days. Planaria begin epimorphosis by the epidermis contracting immediately after the worm is cut at the head as a predator reactionary mechanism in order to decrease the surface area at the site of the cut. This mechanism activates the neoblasts which are totipotent stems cells which allows rhabdites to secrete materials to make a protective mucosal covering and epithelium to gather at the site through spreading of the cells rather than proliferation that occurs in vertebrates The dorsal and ventral epithelial cells then come to the site and become differentiated to begin regeneration. The polarity of the planaria can be reestablished through an anterior-posterior gradient through Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Polarity can be described in planarians that the anterior part of the wound site will create a head of a planaria, and the posterior side will create the tail.

Family Jacob Fletcher lived in Bolton and owned small coal mines in Harwood and Breightmet, Bolton. He had four sons. Matthew was the second eldest. John the eldest, sank a pit in Atherton that led in the 1870s to the formation of Fletcher, Burrows and Company. Jacob became a colliery owner at Darcy Lever and had two sons, Ellis (Matthew Fletcher's heir who died in 1834) and Adam (died 1799). Adam, was a collier at Crompton Fold and had three sons, Matthew (died 1823), Jacob (died circa 1800), and Peter who died in infancy. Wet Earth Colliery thumb Matthew Fletcher came from a family of mine owners and his first notable work was on the property of another mine owner, John Heathcote. During the 1740s, Heathcote had attempted to sink Wet Earth Colliery, the first deep coal mine in the Irwell Valley at Clifton. The workings were plagued with water from the River Irwell via the Pendleton Fault. Heathcote engaged Fletcher to advise on how to solve the flooding. John Heathcote closed the pit in 1750. Heathcote and Fletcher were at a loss as how to dewater the pit until it came to the attention of Heathcote's relation, James Brindley. He was a canal engineer whose feats included the Bridgewater and Trent and Mersey Canals. He suggested using a Newcomen atmospheric pumping engine but the engine had been plagued with problems. His revised scheme relied on water power but there was no flowing water on the site to power a pump and the pithead was above the level of the River Irwell. left At some point between the 1750 pit closure and the 1756 reopening, John Heathcote signed over ownership of Wet Earth Colliery to Matthew Fletcher. After the reopening, Fletcher sank a new deep diameter shaft at Wet Earth, known as Gal Pit from the Galloway ponies traditionally used as pit ponies. Gal Pit reached as far as the Doe coal seam. Later collieries By 1760, Fletcher had sunk the shaft for Botany Bay Colliery about east of Wet Earth Colliery and extended Brindley's leat to the new colliery (parallel to the Irwell for about and then south) and installed a second waterwheel to wind coal up the shaft. Fletcher developed several other collieries in the area including Clifton Hall Colliery, off Lumn's Lane, Clifton. Ringley Colliery was on the east bank of the Irwell upstream of Wet Earth near the intake for Bridley's leat. Spindle Point Colliery was at the junction of Manchester Road and Slackey Brow, in Kearsley, about west of Wet Earth and Robin Hood Colliery was midway between the Wet Earth and Botany Bay collieries, but farther from the Irwell. Fletcher built Clifton House for himself a few yards from the pit. It was demolished in 1965. Fletcher's Canal and the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal In late 1790, Fletcher widened and deepened the head race between Wet Earth and Botany Bay Collieries into a section of canal, which opened in 1791 and became known as Fletcher's Canal. It had no onward connection and for several years can only have been used to carry coal to a wharf for transshipment. In 1796, the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal opened between Rhodes Lock (across the Irwell from Wet Earth Colliery) and Salford. The Clifton Aqueduct took the canal across the river downstream of Botany Bay Colliery but disputes over water rights and usage meant it took five years for Fletcher's Canal to be linked. The Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal relied on agreements with local mill-owners to limit how much water the canal could take from the Irwell. No water from the canal could flow into Fletcher's Canal. Fletcher had built a lock in anticipation of linking to the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal but its fall was too great for the water level in the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal. The canal company consulted Benjamin Outram who recommended the construction of a second lock in Fletcher's Canal but Fletcher enlarged the lock to create a chamber long by wide that had a fall of and could accommodate three narrow boats side by side. Once the link to the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal opened in 1801, Fletcher could send coal Manchester some away. Following the model of the underground canals that Brindley had developed to extend the Bridgewater Canal into the Worsley coal mines, Fletcher had short underground connecting arms cut at the Wet Earth, Botany Bay and Spindle Point Collieries each terminating at a basin next to the shaft, enabling coal to be loaded directly onto barges at the pit head. Later life With the improved access to market that the canal connection brought, Fletcher reinvested in Wet Earth Colliery, buying a steam engine in 1804 and sinking a second shaft in 1805. Fletcher became the chairman of the Mersey and Irwell Navigation and a committeeman of the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal Company. Fletcher died on 24 August 1808 and his nephew, Ellis Fletcher inherited the Clifton Estate. On Ellis's death the estate passed to his son Jacob Fletcher Fletcher who died in 1857 and the collieries were then managed by trustees until his daughter Charlotte Anne Fletcher (who was 12 years old when her father died) was old enough to inherit the business.

The team's home games are played at Hanover Insurance Park at Fitton Field in Worcester. The Bravehearts brought baseball back to Worcester for the first time since the Worcester Tornadoes franchise was disbanded in 2012. Team history The team was announced as a partnership with the College of the Holy Cross on September 30, 2013. The new team's name and logo was announced on December 2, 2013, selecting the name \\"Bravehearts\\". The \\"hearts\\" in the name refer to the heart on Worcester's city seal and nickname as the \\"Heart of the Commonwealth\\". The team began its inaugural season on June 4, 2014, with a 3-1 win in Torrington, Connecticut against the Torrington Titans. On August 14, 2014, the Bravehearts defeated the Martha's Vineyard Sharks 1-0 at Hanover Insurance Park at Fitton Field to clinch the FCBL Championship. In 2015, the Bravehearts started their title defense poorly, but a concluding 8-2 run in their last ten games got them into the playoffs as the sixth seed. They went on to repeat as league champions, defeating the Bristol Blues with a tenth-inning rally in the third game of the best-of-three championship series. Worcester won the West Division with a league-best record of 37-18 during the 2016 regular season, and for the third straight season they advanced to the FCBL Championship Series, where they fell to the Nashua Silver Knights in two games. Total attendance for Bravehearts games went up 18 percent in 2016. Averaging 2,230 spectators per game, the team ranked ninth nationally among total attendance for summer collegiate teams. The Bravehearts won the final game of the 2017 regular season to earn a one-game, winner-moves-on-loser-goes-home game against the Wachusett Dirt Dawgs. The Bravehearts won, 9-2, that sent them to the semifinals against the Brockton Rox. Worcester won the first two of the best- of-three series, capping it off with a wild, 13-7, win on the road. For the fourth straight year – all four of their time in the league – the Bravehearts punched their ticket to the championship series, this time in a rematch against the Nashua Silver Knights. On August 12, Nashua completed the two-game sweep again with a 2-0 victory in Game 2 at Holman Stadium in Nashua. The Bravehearts earned a share of the 2018 FCBL League championship, as the title was split between them and the Martha's Vineyard Sharks. The Bravehearts won Game 1, 10-6, on the Vineyard but lost Game 2, 4-2, at home. After rain washed out Game 3 of the FCBL Championship series at Vineyard Ballpark, league commissioner Chris Hall declared the Bravehearts and Martha’s Vineyard Sharks co-champions. The best-of-three series already had been delayed a day and many players’ flights home already had been booked. Postponing the game to the next day was not an option. In June 2019, the team's owner said he believes the Bravehearts can remain in the market after the 2021 relocation of the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox. Worcester finished the 2019 regular season with a 30-26 record. The Bravehearts beat the Pittsfield Suns in a one-game playoff. They then beat the Brockton Rox, 2-1, in the semifinals to make the championship series for the sixth time in six seasons. After beating the Bristol Blues, 2-1, in Game 1, Worcester won Game 2 in Bristol, 12-2, to win its fourth FCBL title in six years.

Published in 1942, the poem is based on Lofting's experiences during World War I and one of the strongest literary expressions of his pacifism. It was Lofting's second book of verse but the only work written by him for adults. Hugh Lofting's pacifism, a major theme in the poem Victory for the Slain, grew from his experiences in World War I where horses, like the one pictured here, had no way to defend themselves. Background and Lofting’s pacifism Lofting was a pacifist and was often frustrated at the quickness in which governments resorted to armed conflict to resolve international issues. Lofting would often mock the reoccurring “latest war to end all wars” mentality and the martial ardor that often pervaded children's literature. While the theme of the poem is no different from those in the Doctor Dolittle series, the “meaningless and folly of war” as one commentator put it, it is presented in a manner more dark and grim than his children's literature.Schmidt, G.D. (1992). Hugh Lofting. New York: Twayne Publishing That Lofting was consistent in his views is not surprising, having witnessed the horrors of war in Flanders during the First World War. In 1918 he was wounded by shrapnel from a hand grenade in the upper thigh, an injury that would plague him the rest of his life because of the doctor's inability to remove the metal fragments. Soon after his injury he left active service and moved to the United States where he wrote his popular children's series about a country physician who learned to communicate with animals. Lofting wrote his Dr. Dolittle series in order to give the animals he saw in World War I a voice they didn't have. In a larger sense, however, it was clear from the start that the Dr. Dolittle series was about the cruelty of war itself and the hope that Lofting saw from peace and cooperation.Steege, D. (2003). Doctor Dolittle and the empire: Hugh Lofting's response to British colonialism. In A.L. Lucas (Ed.)Presence of The Past In Children’s Literature, 91-97. As early as 1924, Lofting was editorializing about the negative effects of war on children. In an article written for The Nation, Lofting railed against what he called “tin-soldierism,” a state of mind common at the time that glorified war and “heroic deaths”. He attacked the so-called children's classics about heroes galloping across battlefields. “That kind of battlefield has gone for good,” he wrote, “it is still bloody, but you don’t gallop. And since that kind of battlefield has gone, that kind of book—for children—should go too.”Lofting, H. (1924). Children and internationalism. Nation, 118:172-173. Lofting would become an internationalist as a result of his experiences stemming from World War I and advocated “Peace Preparedness” between nations. He would also, at least implicitly, become an anti- imperialist who stressed international cooperation. This spirit of cooperation is evident in his children's books. For instance, in The Voyages of Dr. Dolittle, the title character defends a smaller tribe of “Indians” from a larger tribe. Eventually Dolittle helps the two tribes forge a pact of cooperation. This is just one of many examples of his pacifist philosophy in his children's literature. Lofting's call for peace and preparedness fell on deaf ears and the economic instability that followed World War I, resulting in the Great Depression, would manifest itself in pre-World War II Germany's political situation. Lofting fell into a state of despair at the rise of militarism on the European continent. Feeling like a modern Cassandra, Lofting began work on his seventeenth book, Dr. Dolittle and the Secret Lake. In the summer of 1941, however, he stopped work on the book to write Victory for the Slain. Written just after the major part of Germany's bombing blitz on London, the poem's eventual publication in 1942 was met with little regard. Coming on the heels of England's near eradication, and written from the safe confines of California as his critics would say, it was not well received. That the poem was a culmination of a long-standing philosophy held by the author, rather than a reaction to the current conflict, was not understood by its readers. A commercial failure, the importance of Victory for the Slain lies in the understanding it adds to the author of the Dr. Dolittle series and the peaceful title character more than the content of the poem itself. Structure Victory for the Slain is divided into seven parts, with each part symbolic of the narrator's progression. It uses a traditional rhyming convention. The word “slain” is repeated in the poem thirteen times and the thematic line, “In war the only victors are the slain,” is repeated three times. It uses a mix of military and religious symbolism throughout the seven movements. Plot and themes The narrator is an unknown individual who journeys to, and eventually into, a cathedral. On the way, in the first two movements of the poem, he passes infantry soldiers marching and a wounded World War I veteran. The narrator also passes the poor box which is symbolic of the wealth and treasures wasted in war. In the third movement the narrator then enters a church to seek solace where he muses about the folly of war and the inability of man to learn from his past mistakes as shown in this verse: : Why must I mingle and confuse : These sounds and thoughts that muse : So madly through my mind? : Wars to end wars? —War again! : Must Mankind forever kill and kill, : Thwarting every decent dictate : Of the human will? : War again! — : When well we know : War's final victors always were the slain. In the end, the narrator doesn't find the solace that he seeks as the chancel, the portion of the cathedral he is in during three sections of the poem, is destroyed by bombs. However, the narrator vows to learn from the lessons of the past and not give in to hatred and military revenge. It is here, perhaps, that Lofting is referencing the ongoing conflict of World War II against the Nazi regime. Thus, Lofting and the narrator, as a single person, hope that the “slain” can lead the world to an enlightened peace.

The highway is known as Culebra Road within Bexar County. Route description FM 471 begins at an intersection with I-35 in Natalia. The highway shortly begins an overlap with SH 132 and the two highways travel through the town together. FM 471 leaves the highway and travels to the town of LaCoste. The highway enters Castroville and has a short overlap with US 90. FM 471 serves the small community of Rio Medina before intersecting FM 1283 near Lake Medina. The highway turns after here and runs in a southeast (northbound)-northwest (southbound) direction, despite still being signed north-south. FM 471 enters the city of San Antonio near the Government Canyon State Natural Area. Near SeaWorld, FM 471 ends at an intersection Loop 1604 (Anderson Loop). History Previous route FM 471 was first designated on July 9, 1945 from Dilley to Divot. The highway was then extended further north 5 miles toward Batesville on July 22, 1949. The route was cancelled the next month on August 25. The highway was combined with FM 117. Current route FM 471 opened May 23, 1951, running from US 81 (now SH 132) in Natalia to US 90 in Castroville. On January 29, 1953, FM 1105 from US 90 north and east 24.4 miles to a road intersection was cancelled and combined with FM 471. The highway was extended further east to SH 16 later that year on October 28. The highway was extended further south to I-35 on May 6, 1964. On June 27, 1995, the entire route from Loop 1604 to SH 16 was designated Urban Road 471 (UR 471). On December 18, 2014, the section of FM 471 between Loop 1604 and the Leon Valley city limits was turned back to the city of San Antonio and deleted from the state highway system; this was part of TxDOT's San Antonio turnback program, which gave 21.8 miles of roads to the city. By 2018, the project acceptance letter was issued. As a result of the order and project acceptance letter, the section of FM 471 within Leon Valley became State Highway Spur 471\\\\. This eliminated UR 471. Junction list Spur 471 Spur 471 is a state highway spur located in Leon Valley. The highway was designated on December 18, 2014 when FM 471 was decommissioned inside Loop 1604. The highway begins at the San Antonio–Leon Valley city limits and runs east for approximately a half mile to State Highway 16 (Bandera Road). Spur 471 is known locally as Grissom Road. An Earlier Spur 471 was designated on October 1, 1968, from I-20 in Colorado City to Loop 377. This was cancelled on June 21, 1990 and changed to Business State Highway 208-B.

The design owes a lot to the principles found in log-structured file systems and draws inspiration from a number of designs that involve log file merging. Strengths Bitcask has a number of advantages owing to its write-once, append-only on-disk data-format and its use of an in-memory hash-table of keys for lookups: * Low latency for read and write operations. * High throughput, especially when writing an incoming stream of random items: Because the data being written doesn't need to be ordered on disk and because the log- structured design allows for minimal disk-head movement during writes, these operations generally saturate the I/O and disk bandwidth. * Single seek to retrieve any value: Bitcask's in-memory hash-table of keys points directly to the locations on disk where the data resides. Bitcask never needs more than one disk-seek to read a value, and the operating system's file-system caching can obviate the need for disk-seeks entirely for some lookups. * Predictable lookup and insert performance: Read operations as well as write operations have fixed, predictable behavior. Write operations require only a seek to the end of the current file that is open for writing and an append to that file. * Fast, bounded crash recovery: Bitcask's disk format makes recovery straightforward. The only items that might be lost are partially written records at the tail of the file last opened for writes. Recovery need only review the last record or two written and verify checksums to ensure that the data is consistent. * Easy backup: Bitcask's disk format means that any utility that archives or copies files in disk-block order will properly backup or copy a Bitcask database. Weakness Because Bitcask keeps all keys in memory at all times, the system must have enough memory to contain the entire keyspace in addition to other operational components and the operating system's file-system buffers.

Key Largo cotton mice can breed throughout the year and have an average life expectancy of 5 months. While the cotton mouse is one of the most common small mammals in South Florida, the Key Largo cotton mouse subspecies is endemic to Key Largo, and currently restricted to the northernmost part, due to habitat destruction.

The Key Largo cotton mouse is currently on the United States Fish and Wildlife Service list of endangered species, due to urbanization of Key Largo. This cotton mouse subspecies can reach a body length of seven inches (17.9 centimeters) with a tail length of 3.0 in (7.7 cm). Key Largo cotton mice have a dark hazel back with reddish-brown sides, a white belly, white feet, and a tail that is brown on top and white on the bottom. States Fish and Wildlife Service list of endangered species , due to urbanization of Key Largo. The species previously resided in a variety of tropical hardwood habitats, but urbanization has decimated these areas, reducing the availability of food, shelter, and habitat for the cotton mouse. Surveys show that the Key Largo cotton mouse has lost up to 50% of its habitat due to this urbanization. The remaining habitat of the Key Largo cotton mouse is fragmented, making reproduction and population growth more difficult. Urbanization resulted in many other threats to the Key Largo cotton mouse, such as domesticated animals, human trash, and climate factors (hurricanes and rising sea level). Suggested actions to support the growth of the Key Largo cotton mouse populations and downgrade its listing from endangered to threatened include expanding public awareness and limiting pollution in the area. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. (199, May 18). Recovery plan for the endangered Key Largo cotton mouse. Retrieved from https://ecos.fws.gov/docs/recovery_plan/Key%20Largo%20Cotton%20Mouse%20Recovery%20Plan%20Amendment_1.pdf Taxonomy Due to its longer overall length, tail length, skull measurements, and reddish fur color, the Key Largo cotton mouse was described as a distinct subspecies by Schwartz in 1952. Its subspecific epithet allapaticola originates from the local Seminole Native American term allapattah, which indicates the tropical, dry, deciduous hammocks of South Florida. The Key Large cotton mice have large ears, protuberant eyes, and furry tails. Their coloration follows a pattern of red dorsal fur, dusky brown sides, and white ventral fur. Their tails follow a similar pattern being darker brown on top and whiter underneath. Body length ranges from 170 to 189 mm (as compared with the 100 mm average length for other cotton mouse subspecies), tail length from 72 to 87 mm and hindfoot length from 21 to 23 mm. Distribution Key Largo cotton mouse distribution map Both the Key Largo cotton mouse and the Key Largo woodrat are endemic to Key Largo, Florida. Due to habitat destruction from development and fires, the Key Largo cotton mouse has been pushed to the northernmost portion of Key Largo, North Key Largo. Although historically the Key Largo cotton mouse was once found as far south as Plantation Key, near Tavernier, they are now only found in a confined area north of the U.S. 1-C.R. 905 intersection. This range shift can be attributed to the increased urbanization of Key Largo which has decimated the forests of tropical hardwood hammocks, thus reducing the availability of food, shelter and habitat for the cotton mouse. Surveys indicate that the Key Largo cotton mouse has lost more than 50 percent of its habitat due to this urbanization, and much of the remaining habitat has been degraded or fragmented. This has led to isolation of populations, making proper reproduction and dispersal more difficult. This fragmentation and range limitation makes the Key Largo cotton mouse more vulnerable to fires and hurricanes. These natural catastrophes pose a threat to both existing populations as well as their limited hammock habitat. Additionally, habitat degradation poses a large threat to this species as trash dumping (a common side effect of urbanization) leads to increased populations of black rats (Rattus rattus) and predation by domesticated animals. Rodent control techniques used to combat these black rats also kill cotton mice. Black rats compete with cotton mice and have previously led to the extinction of other cotton mouse subspecies. Habitat While the cotton mouse is one of the most common small mammals in South Florida and throughout the southeastern United States, the Key Largo cotton mouse subspecies is endemic to Key Largo. In addition to being only found in North Key Largo, the Key Largo cotton mouse's preferred habitat is coastal strands adjacent to these forests. The hardwood hammocks they prefer are highly productive forests with a tall canopy and open understory, consisting of a diverse range of species. Behavior Because the population of Key Largo cotton mice is small, many of their behavioral characteristics are inferred from the cotton mouse. The Key Largo cotton mouse builds small nests or dens by lining leaves inside logs, tree hollows, and rock crevices. The entrances to these nests measure around 3 to 9 cm in diameter and are often located at the base of trees; however, in some instances, an interesting relationship exists in that the Key Largo cotton mouse may share a nest with another endangered species, the Key Largo woodrat. Key Largo cotton mice build leaf-lined nests in logs, tree hollows, and rock crevices. These are usually quite hidden, partially covered by leaves or bark, located at the bases of trees and with opening holes only 3 to 9 cm in diameter. Male mice tend to be less territorial than females, and thus have larger home ranges. These home ranges can overlap between different mice. Cotton mice are known to move at least 2 km in a 1 to 2 days period. These mice are nocturnal feeders and, as omnivores, feed on a wide variety of plant and animal materials. Much of the fruit and berries produced by tropical hardwood hammock habitat species can be food items for the occupant cotton mice. More research is needed to know which berries more specifically are eaten by Key Largo cotton mice. Key Largo cotton mice are known to breed throughout the year. While other populations of Florida cotton mice have high reproduction in the fall and early winter, breeding patterns for the cotton mice of Southern Florida have been found to be highly variable. Key Largo cotton mice produce two to three litters a year with an average of four pups per litter. Cotton mice are short-lived species with an average life expectancy of five months, although potential lifespans can range up to three years. Research about Key Largo cotton mice is still underway to understand the life history of this subspecies in more detail. Conservation The Key Largo cotton mouse was recognized by the Fish and Wildlife Service in a notice of review on July 28, 1980 (45 FR 49961). It was listed as endangered for 240 days on September 21, 1983, through an emergency listing action (48 FR 43040). The Key Largo cotton mouse was proposed as endangered with critical habitat on February 9, 1984 (49FR 4951) and was listed as an endangered species on August 31, 1984 (49 FR 34504). Urbanization has caused much of the decline in species population and because of this, a number of efforts have been made to try to re-establish population in less urbanized areas of the Florida Keys; however, success is very limited. In the past, very little research focused primarily on the Key Largo cotton mouse and additional information about this species is needed. Density and distribution studies of the Key Largo cotton mouse have been conducted, but the status of the current population is not known. Habitat destruction continued to threaten the species. By 1991, 41.2% of the seasonal deciduous forest on Key Largo had been cleared or filled for human needs, and by 1999 over 50% of the Key Largo cotton mouses’ habitat had been lost to urbanization. While the historic range of the Key Largo cotton mouse spanned both Key Largo and Plantation Key, as of 1999 the species was only found in the northern region of Key Largo. The remaining habitat of the Key Largo cotton mouse is severely fragmented. This population isolation makes it hard for individuals to find mates, limiting reproduction and population growth. The rise in domesticated animals has also harmed the Key Largo cotton mouse population. Pet dogs and cats prey on Key Largo cotton mice, killing them and reducing their numbers. Trash and pollution boost black rat populations, which can outcompete the Key Largo cotton mouse for resources such as food. Efforts to control black rat populations, such as pesticides and rat traps, often harm Key Largo cotton mice. The rise in invasive predators such as the Burmese python (Python bivittatus) and the black and white tegus (Salvator merianae) has also contributed to declining Key Largo cotton mouse populations. Climate factors also pose a threat to Key Largo cotton mice. Key Largo is highly susceptible to hurricanes, with 20 hurricanes making landfall in Key Largo between 1900-1990.National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 1995. Draft management plan and environmental impact statement, Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; Marathon, Florida. Since the habitats of Key Largo cotton mice are at low elevation and fragmented, the species have difficulty finding safe shelter. Climate change is expected to increase the number of extreme weather events such as hurricanes, worsening the threat to Key Largo cotton mice. Rising sea levels due to global climate change are also expected to further fragment Key Largo cotton mouse habitats. It is predicted that as sea levels rise, the hardwood hammock habitats of Key Largo cotton mice will transition into unsuitable mangrove forests, resulting in an even smaller habitat for the species. Efforts to protect the Key Largo cotton mouse are primarily focused on habitat protection. Negotiations between the Fish and Wildlife Service and organizations seeking to accelerate construction on Key Largo via water and electricity expansion resulted in exclusion zones in 1980. In these zones, water and electricity expansion is prohibited in order to protect the Key Largo cotton mouse and other endangered species. This is important because once an area has access to water and electricity, residential and commercial construction projects (such as houses, stores, and restaurants) can be started. These construction projects destroy natural habitat which endangers all the species that live there. These exclusion zones make up 45% of the Key Largo cotton mouse’s habitat. The most successful action to preserve Key Largo cotton mouse populations thus far has been the public acquisition of land to establish the Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge and the Key Largo Hammocks State Botanical Site. Thanks to these efforts, 91% of Key Largo cotton mouse habitat is protected. The US Fish and Wildlife Service has recommended several other conservation strategies in order to downlist the Key Largo cotton mouse from endangered to threatened. These actions include researching to learn more about the species, its distribution, and its needs, raising public awareness of the species, expanding protection to 100% of Key Largo cotton mouse habitat, creating a 500-meter buffer zone around protected habitat, limiting pesticides and other pollutants, and widening the species’ range by establishing populations in South Key Largo and other Keys.

Life and career He was born on October 27, 1851 in Marshfield, Massachusetts. His parents were Warren Kent, a builder, and Eliza Weston Kent.The Massachusetts Register: A State Record for the Year 1852. 1852 As a young man in 1875, Kent took a job with John W. Ellis, a Woonsocket engineer who was also the chief engineer of the Providence & Worcester Railroad. In that capacity, Ellis was responsible for the design and construction of the local train station (1882), and Kent may have thus had a hand in the design. He remained with Ellis until 1884, when he opened an office in Woonsocket for the practice of engineering. Later in the 1880s he expanded his practice to include architecture.\\"Memoir of Willard Kent\\". Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers. 1924. Later he opened an office in Narragansett Pier, where he would eventually also live on a permanent basis. Kent is also notable as the teacher of Walter F. Fontaine. Kent also trained Roland A. Thayer, an important member of Lockwood, Greene & Co., from 1891 to 1896.Lincoln, Samuel B. Lockwood Greene: The History of an Engineering Business, 1832-1958. Boston: Stephen Greene, 1960. Work As an architect, Kent generally remained in the mainstream. His early works were in the Romanesque Revival, Queen Anne, and Shingle styles. In the 1890s he utilized the Colonial Revival, and his latest works trended toward the eclectic. Perhaps his most important building was the Woonsocket Opera House, begun in 1887 and completed the following year. The building was used for many functions aside from its auditorium, including functioning as an annex to the Monument House, a neighboring hotel. Lysander W. Elliott, owner of the hotel, also managed the opera house.Industries and Wealth of the Principal Points in Rhode Island. New York: A. F. Parsons, 1892. Designed in the Romanesque style, it was one of the largest buildings yet built in the city. While restoration was being planned, it was destroyed by a fire in 1975. A contemporary, but rural, example of Kent's work is the Rocky Brook Reservoir Pumping Station in Peace Dale, which still stands. In his book Buildings of Rhode Island, architectural historian William H. Jordy calls it \\"a picturesque attempt for industrial rusticity\\". The building reuses many of the design moves Kent made in the opera House, but in a more laid back, playful way. It was designed and built in 1889.Jordy, William H. Buildings of Rhode Island. 2004. A later work is the Hope Street School, in the Constitution Hill neighborhood of Woonsocket. Unlike his ornate designs of the 1880s, his work in the 1890s was often marked by severe simplicity. This is exemplified in this school, where the only major ornamental elements are the Doric portico and the heavy cornice. Other than this, the design relies on window openings for architectural interest.Hope Street School NRHP Nomination. 2000.

The same way that in typography there are different typefaces or fonts, in graffiti there are different handstyles. Similarly to the way a typographer would focus on typefaces, point sizes, line lengths, line-spacing (leading), and letter- spacing (tracking), a writer would focus on line lengths, line direction, line curvature, letter size and letter balance. The concept of having unique and expressive handstyles developed slowly. When graffiti first started in the 70's, a tag's style was the writer's personal handwriting. In the New York and Philadelphia in the late 80's, different writers and crews started stylizing and personalizing their tags. Over time, the concept of a handstyle emerged through the stylising of these tags. Today specific handstyles are associated to specific writers, crews, gangs and even cities, such as the Philly Handstyle. Handstyles can be used as the basis for evaluation. Writers are usually perceived as having \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" handstyles by those in the graffiti community. Good handstyle is usually associated with style, consistency(uniformity), flow, and balance while bad handsyles are associated with sloppy letters, bad form and lack of style.  Regional handstyles  Handstyles are usually unique to a writer or a crew but they can also be regional or shared between several writers. For example, in the 70s and 80s, the cities of Philadelphia and Chicago had distinct handstyles. Other regional handstyles include Pichação and Cholo handstyles. In Philadelphia, the Philly Handstyle is still very prominent. Almost all local handstyles are somewhat influenced by the Philly Handstyle. What makes this handstyle unique is that the letters are stretched out vertically and the tag is usually painted in very few if not one line. This usually gives a sharp and energetic aesthetic almost looking like cursive letters. Philly letters are usually difficult to read for those outside the graffiti community due to this abstraction and stylisation of the letters. Pichação is a handstyle developed in São Paulo. This handstyle is distinctively cryptic and has a dark aesthetic. The letters are usually painted vertically, while free climbing or rappeling off buildings. The result of this is long horizontal hieroglyphic/cryptic tags. In São Paulo all writers are influenced by Pichação even if they do not use this style and it can be seen all around the major cities of Brazil. This style has also spread to Europe, specifically Germany where the Berlin Kidz, have added their own style to it. Cholo Handstyle descended from gang writing in Chicano neighborhoods in the 60s and 70s, and even hand-painted gang lettering in the 40s, is a prominent handstyle in Los Angeles. The handstyle can be described as \\"elegant, single-line scripts.\\" The style has been popularized by writers such as Chaz Bjorquez, CRYPTIK, DEFER, SLEEPS, PRIME. The L.A. handstyle has reached global significance, especially within the art world through galleries, exhibitions, and collections.

The events of the murders On 1 November 2013, two men approached the party headquarters in Neo Irakleio, a northern suburb of Athens, and fired indiscriminately. Golden Dawn members Giorgos Fountoulis and Manos Kapelonis were struck and killed, and a third man, Alexandros Gerontas, was seriously injured. A witness reported that a man got off a motorcycle, wearing a helmet, and fired.Golden Dawn members killed outside party office, Associated Press, 1 November 2013.Two members of Greece's Golden Dawn shot dead, BBC News, 1 November 2013. Police described the shooting as a \\"terrorist attack\\". Two weeks later, a previously unknown socialist militant group, \\"The Militant People's Revolutionary Forces\\" claimed responsibility for the attacks in a communication to a local news outlet, and said that the attacks were in retaliation for the two months earlier murder of anti-fascist activist and rapper Pavlos Fyssas. Police were unable to verify the authenticity of this claim of responsibility. Background of the victims Manolis Kapelonis Manolis or Manos Kapelonis () was 22 years old, lived in Galatsi and had studied at the Athens Hellenic College. His father had served as president of the Association of Civil Government before 2010, and is now president in Public Construction Medical Institutions. The offices of the Local Organisation Northern Suburbs opened every Monday and Friday afternoon. He was among the most active part of the ideological faction. There deputies and officers often made speeches, and their chief texts and the parliamentary candidate in Boeotia often appeared on the official website of the Golden Dawn. His funeral took place on November 4, 2013, at the Church of Ipapanti in Artemida, with the discreet presence of police, and without media coverage, upon his family's request. Giorgos Fountoulis Giorgos or Yiorgos Fountoulis () was 27 years old, lived in Neo Irakleio, and had studied physiotherapy. He had friends in Golden Dawn and took part in its events and activities, distributing leaflets with Kapelonis. He helped out as a security guard at the offices of Golden Dawn of the Local Organisation Northern Suburbs, and also with Golden Dawn's on-call safeguarding service for elderly pensioners who asked for protection when shopping or collecting their pensions. He had been a Golden Dawn member for at least one year, and was one of the keenest members in the Local Organisation Northern suburbs, though was not at a high level of Golden Dawn in security matters. His father worked at the post office. His funeral took place on November 4, 2013, at the Church of St. Georgios in Irakleio. At the funeral, hundreds shouted \\"He Lives Forever\\", also singing the Greek national anthem while holding Greek flags. Reactions to the murders Political reactions The government, through its spokesman Simos Kedikoglou, made the following statement for the double murder: \\"The killers, whoever they may be, will be dealt with ruthlessly by democracy, justice and the united Greek society. Let everyone know\\". Political parties condemned the assassination. The murder of the two members hit the headlines and became the first topic on the global networks in Greece and around the world. The party of Golden Dawn issued an announcement after the assassination blaming the government and the media for the murders, further accusing the government of Antonis Samaras for failing to deal effectively with terrorism while the anti-terrorist branch of the Greek police was investigating Golden Dawn for criminal offenses instead. The Municipal Council of Thessaloniki condemned, by resolution, the murders of the two men in Neo Irakleio. In December 2013, the government of Greece offered a reward of 1 million Euros, to anyone who would provide information that would lead to the capture of the murderers of Manolis Kapelonis and Giorgos Fountoulis. Other reactions Golden Dawn commemorated thrice in memory of Kapelonis and Fountoulis of the Golden Dawn attended by MP Members and Greek citizens. Commemorations and marches of people holding candles and torches, also took place in countries like Serbia, Italy and Spain; and in cities like Rome, Milan and Madrid. Supporters of football teams Radnički Niš Hellas Verona and Lazio hung banners during the group match with slogans in support of the two victims. Golden Dawn also conducted actions including food distribution, donations and marches in the memory of the pair. Claim of responsibility On the 16 November Zougla announced that an unknown person contacted the station informing them the area where an envelope which contained a USB stick was placed; and that the digital proclamation was stored on it. Zougla uploaded the proclamation online, in which a newly found organization, The Fighting People's Revolutionary Powers, claimed the responsibility for the attack. The proclamation stated that the murders were seen by the group as retaliation for the murder of Pavlos Fyssas. Following the proclamation, Golden Dawn stated that \\"the miserable and stupid manifesto of the cowardly murderers proves that they belong to the criminal ideological womb of the far left\\". The anti-terrorist branch of the Greek police announced that it considered the digital proclamation as authentic and is investigating the case.

Buxbaum is also, along with Simon Baron-Cohen, the co-editor of the BioMed Central journal Molecular Autism, and is a member of the scientific advisory board of the Autism Science Foundation. Buxbaum is a Professor of Psychiatry, Neuroscience, and Genetics and Genomic Sciences. He is also the Vice Chair for Research and for Mentoring in the Department of Psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Education Buxbaum received his BSc in Math and Biology from Touro College (New York, NY) in 1980. In 1983, he received his MSc in Neurobiology from the Weizmann Institute of Science (Rehovot, Israel), where he also received his PhD in Neurobiology in 1988. Buxbaum completed a Postdoctoral Fellowship in Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience at the Rockefeller University (New York, NY) in 1991. Research Buxbaum's research focuses on using genetic and functional methods to identify and characterize genes and pathways involved in autism, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer disease. His research focuses on common and rare genetic variation in neuropsychiatric disorders and has been an early leader in rare genetic variation in psychiatry. With the advent of massively parallel sequencing, this focus on rare variation is now providing profound insights into many neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism, intellectual disability, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and Alzheimer disease. In Alzheimer disease, Buxbaum has conducted several cell-biological and patient- based analyses of APP and A-beta and he and his group continue to do genetic and functional analyses in Alzheimer disease. In schizophrenia, Buxbaum and his colleagues pioneered early molecular research into white matter/oligodendrocyte abnormalities, and they continue to examine molecular changes in this disorder using large brain cohorts and animal models. Buxbaum's research in autism has shown that genetic risk includes rare and common variation as well as de novo and inherited variation. Buxbaum is the founder and co-Principal Investigator of the Autism Sequencing Consortium (ASC), an international group of scientists who share autism samples, data, and ideas in order to accelerate the understanding of the causes and treatments of autism. The ASC is the largest whole-exome sequencing study in autism, with over 22,000 samples analyzed to date. Buxbaums research also extends into cell and animal models. His group has an extensive functional genomics laboratory using yeast two hybrid, cultured cells, and rodent and other animal models in neuropsychiatric disorders. Functional studies in his laboratory have led to pathway discovery in autism, schizophrenia and Alzheimer disease, to more than a dozen animal models, and to a clinical trial showing preliminary efficacy in patients with a SHANK3 mutation. Buxbaum has published over 250 peer-reviewed articles that have garnered more than 30,000 citations, with 216 papers having 10 or more citations. Awards Buxbaum has received numerous awards for his research. He is a Fellow of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ACNP) and received both their basic and clinical research awards (the Daniel E. Efron Award, for \\"outstanding basic research contributions to neuropsychopharmacology\\" in 2005 and the Joel Elkes International Award, \\"in recognition of an outstanding clinical contribution to neuropsychopharmacology\\" in 2010). In 2008, he received recognition from the Eden Institute Foundation for his \\"commitment and dedication to improving the quality of life in individuals with autism.\\" In 2010, Buxbaum received the Richard D.

In 1937, after the Sino-Japanese War broke out, his family returned to the Philippines and settled in the Municipality of San Juan (now a city). In 1942, the young Austria began his education in Santa Lucia Elementary School, located just a few meters away from their house in San Juan.

By the time he went to high school at San Sebastian College in 1948, he had decided to pursue a career in the arts. After finishing high school in 1952, he studied fine arts in the University of Santo Tomas in Manila (UST). In Santo Tomas, he honed his artistic skills under the tutelage of the most renowned Filipino artists, such as Victorio Edades, Vicente Manansala, Diosdado Lorenzo and Galo Ocampo, who all greatly influenced his painting style. It was also at UST where he met his close friend, National Artist Ang Kiukok.

Ben Dickinson, Christopher Ford, and Duncan Skiles star as advertising workers who go on a camping trip to find inspiration for their latest campaign, only to find their sanity tested in the woods.  Plot  In an infomercial, Mickey Hauser, a spokesperson for Clara Clean Corporation, advertises Claractix, a cleaning product. Ben Richards attempts to finish a portrait of a man in a suit, but he can not visualize the face, which remains blank. After several attempts, he gives up and shaves off his beard. When he meets with his coworkers, radio and newspaper reports reveal that Hauser has died and that Clara Clean Corporation has become involved in an ecological scandal. Richards and his coworkers have been recruited to come up with an ecologically-themed advertising campaign to counter this scandal, but Doug Quaid rejects all of John Kimble's stock photography. Ben suggests that they go to a Delaware campsite to seek inspiration and take their own photographs. Meanwhile, Sonia Roja's boss tells her that her boyfriend, Kimble, has one week to come up with a fantastic advertising campaign. Unless it is fantastic, Roja will take the fall. Quaid, too, feverishly repeats that the campaign must be fantastic. Richards, Quaid, Kimble, and Roja set off for the campsite. On the way, Kimble receives a phone call from Ivan, who invites them to a barbecue. Kimble tells Richards that a mysterious person will be there along with them, though he refuses to reveal who. When they arrive, Quaid unsuccessfully flirts with Roja, who is more interested in her cell phone than him, and Richards takes some photographs, all of which come out distorted. At Ivan's barbecue, Richards sees Summer Day, an acquaintance upon whom he once had a crush. Encouraged by Quaid, Richards approaches her, and they embrace. Richards and Day go off into the woods on their own and have sex, though Richards later denies to Quaid that they had sex. The next day, Richards and Day go swimming. Quaid teases Richards about going into the water with his glasses on, and Richards removes his glasses, which leaves his vision blurred and unfocused. In the water, Richards fumbles in conversation with Day, and she wanders off into the wilderness with Quaid. Kimble dismisses Richards' concerns when Quaid and Day do not return, and Roja denies Kimble's insistence that something is bothering her. Kimble encourages Richards to take more photographs, but they turn out to be similarly distorted. Hauser critiques Richards' photography and suggests that his camera's lens may need cleaning. Disturbed by the camera's malfunction and his hallucination, Richards returns to camp and recruits a reluctant Kimble to search for Quaid and Day. The two wander through the forest, where they find Day's underwear, blood on a rock, and a memory card; however, they locate no sign of Quaid or Day. They give up and head back to the camp. While viewing the images on the memory card, Kimble's laptop malfunctions, and the images are destroyed. Roja complains of hearing voices and eerie sounds in the forest, but Kimble reacts skeptically, and they all go to sleep. Richards has a strange dream or vision involving a musical number performed by Quaid and Day. When he awakens, Quaid has returned to the camp, disoriented and manic. Roja watches over Quaid as Kimble and Richards check the camp; disturbed by Quaid's behavior, Roja calls for assistance, and Quaid bolts into the forest. Richards chases after Quaid, and, in the light, finds blood on Quaid's hands. Quaid runs off again, and Richards finds his body at the bottom of a cliff. Hauser appears and tells Richards to take a second look at the cliff, this time without his glasses; he does and throws his glasses over the edge. He is then approached by a corpse- like Day, upon whom he can not focus. Richards hallucinates extensively, and, upon returning to the camp, he discovers that Kimble has murdered Roja. Richards puts out Kimble's eyes, opens his skull, and extracts a serrated knife from Kimble's head. He hallucinates further and cuts out the face from his father's portrait.  Cast  Many of the characters' names are the same as characters in Arnold Schwarzenegger films The Running Man, Total Recall, Kindergarten Cop, and Red Sonja.  Production  Director Graham Reznick originally worked as a sound designer, recordist, and assistant director for Ti West, who is a childhood friend. The Viewer, a short film that is included with the DVD release of I Can See You was intended to be an introduction to Reznick's experimental, surrealistic style. Videodrome was a big influence on Reznick, and the final scenes in I Can See You are inspired by that film. The film came from an idea that West and he had: both would write and direct a film about a group of people who go into the woods. Reznick focused on the experimental qualities of the film, as he knew that he would not be given as much freedom on future projects.  Release  After its initial, limited theatrical release distributed by Cinema Purgatorio, I Can See You was picked up for VOD and DVD by Kino International. The film was released on DVD on October 27, 2009.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 100% of five surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 7.5/10. Joshua Siebalt of Dread Central rated the film 3/5 stars and called it \\"one of the most indefinable films I think I’ve ever seen.\\" Nathan Lee of The New York Times wrote, \\"David Lynch is the key influence here, and Mr. Reznick proves himself a keen disciple of the master. I Can See You heralds a splendid new filmmaker with one eye on genre mechanics, one eye on avant-garde conceits and a third eye for transcendental weirdness.\\" Samuel Zimmerman of Fangoria rated it 3.5/4 stars and called it \\"without a doubt one of the most intriguing and well-crafted low-budget horror films in recent memory.\\" Steve Ericson of Baltimore City Paper wrote that I Can See You is \\"a horror film that succeeds on its own terms, rather than looking like a bid to direct a Saw sequel. I Can See You is a true adventure: Reznick has gone into the wilderness and come back with an extremely promising feature debut.\\" Andrew O'Heir of Salon wrote that the film \\"goes from comic- realistic mode into full-on psycho meltdown with more terrifying adroitness than any other movie of this decade. Just out on DVD. See. It. Now.\\" Ronny Scheib of Variety wrote, \\"Atmospheric audio fills each leaf and branch with nameless menace, while superimpositions and slow dissolves trace a psychological slide toward disintegration.\\" Scheib states that the film could develop a cult following. Nicolas Rapold of The Village Voice wrote, \\"So much about this movie and its characters should be annoying, but the sensory disorientation climaxes in a freakout that wipes all your troubles away, as well as anything else lying around in your head.\\"  References   External links  2008 films 2008 horror films American films American independent films American psychological horror films Films set in New York (state) Films set in Delaware 2008 directorial debut films ","title":"I Can See You (film)"},{"id":"41254983","text":"Atraf-i-Baldah or just Atraf Baldah district was the capital of Hyderabad state.

A second species, S. hebridicus, was named after the Hebrides in Scotland, where it was found; it was synonymized with S. ooliticus in 2017.

Journal of the Geological Society of London 128:119-125 Despite being the first tritylodontid genus found and named, Stereognathus remains poorly represented, being known mainly from isolated molar teeth. There is, however, one holotype fragment of maxilla with three damaged molars, and a second fragment of maxilla with four sets of molar roots. In 2017, Elsa Panciroli and colleagues found no points of variance between the anatomy of S. ooliticus and S. hebridicus, accounting for changes with growth, which makes S. hebridicus a junior synonym of S. ooliticus. Also in 2017, Alexander Averianov and colleagues considered species of Polistodon, Xenocretosuchus, and Montirictus to be within the genus Stereognathus; they also retained S. hebridicus as a separate species. However, this would mean Stereognathus persisted almost unchanged for over 60 million years across the whole of Eurasia, which would be very unusual. The issue remains unresolved.

Laos' ambitious strategies for development are based on generating electricity from its rivers and selling the power to its neighbors, namely Thailand, China, and Vietnam, as well as its initiative to become a 'land-linked' nation, shown by the planning of four new railways connecting Laos to those same countries. This, along with growth of the mining sector, Laos has been referred to as one of East Asia and Pacific's fastest growing economies by the World Bank, with annual GDP growth averaging 7% for the past decade. It is a member of the Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement (APTA), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), East Asia Summit and La Francophonie.

It is located in the village of Hestad, on a small peninsula jutting into the Hestadfjorden, a lake that is part of the river Gaula. Because of its location on a small \\"island\\"-like peninsula, the church is also known as the (\\"island church\\"). It is one of the four churches for the Gaular parish which is part of the Sunnfjord prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bjørgvin. The white, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1805 by an unknown architect. The church seats about 80 people. History Hestad Chapel on FV610P and FV421 The chapel has a history that dates back to the Middle Ages. Legend has it that there was a church at Øyra the 12th century, but in written sources it is first mentioned in accounts from 1327. In an overview of the local church's seven properties from ca. 1350, Øyra church is mentioned as one of the five churches in Gaular. After the Black Death the church was no longer in use. Historical records show that the church was again in use by the late 16th century. Before the road on the south side of the lake was opened in 1884, the lake was the main route of transportation through the Gaula river valley. The chapel was located in the middle of the lake, making it the perfect location. In the summer, people went boat through the strait by the chapel and in winter they sled across the lake. The old chapel was demolished in 1805 and a new one was built on the same site partly of material from the old chapel. The small, wooden chapel seats about 80 people. The roof and tower were destroyed by a strong storm in 1864 and were therefore built. The church bell is from the 17th century. The altarpiece is from 1805. The chapel is only used for special worship as well as for funerals and weddings. The church was purchased by the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments (Fortidsminneforeningen) in 1917. The chapel and surrounding area are protected due to historical and natural qualities. In 1940 a bridge was built over the straits and in 1970 a road was built to the north of Hestad Fjord. Norwegian county roads FV610P and FV421 pass right in front of the chapel.

Biography Peter Van Zandt Lane is a recipient of a 2018 Charles Ives Fellowship from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, a 2017 Aaron Copland House Award, and a 2015 Composers Now residency at the Pocantico Center. Other composer residencies include MacDowell Colony, Yaddo, Virginia Center for the Creative Arts, and the Atlantic Center for the Arts. He has been commissioned twice by the Barlow Endowment for Music Composition (2011 and 2014), the Atlanta Chamber Players, American Chamber Winds for a concerto for trombonist Joseph Alessi, the Composers Conference and Chamber Music Center at Wellesley College, the Sydney Conservatorium Wind Ensemble, Juventas New Music Ensemble, Emory Wind Ensemble, and Dinosaur Annex Music Ensemble. His music has been played by International Contemporary Ensemble, New York Virtuoso Singers, the Cleveland Orchestra, Ensemble Signal, Talea Ensemble, Freon Ensemble (Rome), and Triton Brass. His compositions for winds –namely Hivemind and Astrarium– have become programmed widely by college and university wind ensembles in the United States. Lane holds degrees from Brandeis University (M.A., Ph.D.) and the University of Miami Frost School of Music (B.M.). His composition teachers include Melinda Wagner, David Rakowski, Eric Chasalow, and Lansing McLoskey. He has held positions at Wellesley College, Harvard University, MIT, the University of Florida, and is currently composition faculty at the University of Georgia. Works Lane's 2017 concerto for trombone and wind ensemble, Radix Tyrannis, was commissioned by American Chamber Winds for trombonist Joseph Alessi, and was premiered at the 2017 World Association for Symphonic Bands and Ensembles conference in Utrecht, Netherlands. Peter Van Zandt Lane's 2013 ballet, \\"HackPolitik\\" was composed for and premiered by Boston-based Juventas New Music Ensemble and Brooklyn-based contemporary dance company The People Movers. Based on a series of cyber-attacks between 2010 and 2012 linked to the hacker groups Anonymous and LulzSec, the ballet depicts the rise and fall of Topiary (hacktivist) and Sabu (hacktivist) through a combination of “electroacoustic music, modern dance, and video projection\\" and \\"examine[s] how the Internet . . . blurs the lines between activism and anarchy.”http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57611236-1/ddos-as-dance- anonymous-hits-the-ballet/ The music and choreography (by People Movers Artistic Director Kate Ladenheim) aims to \\"translat[e] cyberspace into music and motion.\\"http://www.bostonmagazine.com/arts- entertainment/article/2013/11/11/hackpolitik-dance-boston-university/ In an interview with the Clyde Fitch Report, Lane cited the wider cultural implications of social networking as a motivation for composing the piece, stating that “whether or not we are engaged in cyber-activism… we are constantly thinking about ‘what do I write here?

Winner-take-all systems work by connecting modules (task-designated areas) in such a way that when one action is performed it stops all other actions from being performed, so only one action is occurring at a time. The name comes from the idea that the \\"winner\\" action takes all of the motor system's power.Schilling, M., Paskarbeit, J., Hoinville, T., Hüffmeier, A., Schneider, A., Schmitz, J., Cruse, H. (Sept. 17 2013). A hexapod walker using a heterarchical structure for action selection. Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience, 7. Öztürk, P. (2009). Levels and types of action selection: The action selection soup. Adaptive Behavior, 17. Koch, C., Ullman, S. (1985). Shifts in selective visual attention: Towards the underlying neural circuitry. Retrieved from .  History  In the 1980s and 1990s, many roboticists and cognitive scientists were attempting to find speedier and more efficient alternatives to the traditional world modeling method of action selection.Jones, J.L. (2004). Robot programming: A practical guide to behavior-based robotics. The McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. In 1982, Jerome A. Feldman and D.H. Ballard published the \\"Connectionist Models and Their Properties\\", referencing and explaining winner-take-all as a method of action selection. Feldman's architecture functioned on the simple rule that in a network of interconnected action modules, each module will set its own output to zero if it reads a higher input than its own in any other module.Ballard, D.H., Feldman, J.A. (1982). Connectionist models and their properties. Cognitive Science, 6, 205-54. In 1986, Rodney Brooks introduced behavior-based artificial intelligence. Winner-take-all architectures for action selection soon became a common feature of behavior-based robots, because selection occurred at the level of the action modules (bottom-up) rather than at a separate cognitive level (top-down), producing a tight coupling of stimulus and reaction.Brooks, R.A. (1986). A robust layered control system for a mobile robot. IEEE Journal of Robotics and Automation, 2, 14-23. Retrieved from .  Types of winner-take-all architectures  Hierarchy In the hierarchical architecture, actions or behaviors are programmed in a high-to-low priority list, with inhibitory connections between all the action modules. The agent performs low-priority behaviors until a higher-priority behavior is stimulated, at which point the higher behavior inhibits all other behaviors and takes over the motor system completely. Prioritized behaviors are usually key to the immediate survival of the agent, while behaviors of lower priority are less time-sensitive. For example, \\"run away from predator\\" would be ranked above \\"sleep.\\" While this architecture allows for clear programming of goals, many roboticists have moved away from the hierarchy because of its inflexibility.Rosenblatt, J.K. (1995). DAMN: A distributed architecture for mobile navigation. Retrieved from . Heterarchy and fully distributed In the heterarchy and fully distributed architecture, each behavior has a set of pre-conditions to be met before it can be performed, and a set of post- conditions that will be true after the action has been performed. These pre- and post-conditions determine the order in which behaviors must be performed and are used to causally connect action modules. This enables each module to receive input from other modules as well as from the sensors, so modules can recruit each other. For example, if the agent’s goal were to reduce thirst, the behavior \\"drink\\" would require the pre-condition of having water available, so the module would activate the module in charge of \\"find water\\". The activations organize the behaviors into a sequence, even though only one action is performed at a time. The distribution of larger behaviors across modules makes this system flexible and robust to noise.Blumberg, B.M. (1996). Old tricks, new dogs: Ethology and interactive creatures. Retrieved from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Database. Some critics of this model hold that any existing set of division rules for the predecessor and conflictor connections between modules produce sub-par action selection. In addition, the feedback loop used in the model can in some circumstances lead to improper action selection.Tyrrell, T. (Mar. 1 1994). An evaluation of Maes’ bottom-up mechanism for behavior selection. Adaptive Behavior, 2, 307-348. Arbiter and centrally coordinated In the arbiter and centrally coordinated architecture, the action modules are not connected to each other but to a central arbiter. When behaviors are triggered, they begin \\"voting\\" by sending signals to the arbiter, and the behavior with the highest number of votes is selected. In these systems, bias is created through the \\"voting weight\\", or how often a module is allowed to vote. Some arbiter systems take a different spin on this type of winner-take-all by using a \\"compromise\\" feature in the arbiter. Each module is able to vote for or against each smaller action in a set of actions, and the arbiter selects the action with the most votes, meaning that it benefits the most behavior modules. This can be seen as violating the general rule against creating representations of the world in behavior-based AI, established by Brooks. By performing command fusion, the system is creating a larger composite pool of knowledge than is obtained from the sensors alone, forming a composite inner representation of the environment. Defenders of these systems argue that forbidding world-modeling puts unnecessary constraints on behavior-based robotics, and that agents benefits from forming representations and can still remain reactive.

The national enforcement body was initially assigned as the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), but was later moved to the Civil Aviation Authority, who subsequently delegated responsibility to an airline industry dispute resolution body. A record 3.7 million passengers were assisted at 31 UK airports between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019. Since 2014 the number of passengers assisted increased by 49% while overall passenger numbers increased by 25%. http://publicapps.caa.co.uk/docs/33/CAP1821.pdf This PRM growth reflects similar trends across the European Union which has experienced year on year growth. PRM traffic has been hugely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic which saw 48% airports state full closure in Ozion's PRM Impact and Recovery Survey http://www.ozion-airport.com/covid-19-prm-impact- and-recovery-survey-results/ during the month of April, followed by 29% in May. PRM passengers are expected to be the last group of passengers to resume air travel due to their high-risk status. Rail infrastructure In the UK the \\"Access for all\\" programme of rail infrastructure improvements began in 2006, designed to allow more accessible trains and stations for disabled passengers and passengers facing mobility restraints. Improvements include accessible WC facilities, automatic doors, tactile paving, lifts and ramps, and originally targeted over 1500 stations in the UK for completion in 2024, however planned implementations were repeated cut. https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/funding-cuts-hit-station- access-for-disabled-travellers-9256663.html. As of 2020 the access situation remains extremely variable, with only 61% of stations offering level access to the platform https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/insights/how-accessible-are- britains-railway-stations/. A significant proportion of UK rolling stock was legally required to be replaced by the end of 2019 as failing to meet accessibility standards under legislation dating from 2010, however in December 2019 the government was forced to issue a waiver allowing over 1200 inaccessible carriages to remain in service as many of the Train Operating Companies had left their replacement programmes until the last minute, and then seen them delayedhttps://www.railnews.co.uk/news/2019/12/20-rail- minister-issues-accessibility-warning.html. Ferry Travel Travelling by ferry remains a problem for Persons with Reduced Mobility as most passenger ships currently operating were designed prior to the current European and British legislation on access. Many ferry companies cannot provide adequate accessible facilities due to the design of the ship. Requests to travel from persons with reduced mobility, can be refused on the grounds of safety, under a legal requirement that all passengers need to be evacuated from a vessel in less than 30 minutes. Buses and Coaches In the UK accessibility of buses and coaches is covered by the Public Service Vehicle Access Regulations (PSVAR), however the UK government initially derogatedfrom the EU requirement for all drivers to receive disability awareness training for a period of five years. In late 2019 the government issued a waiver allowing buses and coaches used for transport to and from schools to continue to ignore PSVAR access requirements that would have come into force at the start of 2020https://www.disabilitynewsservice.com/ministers-give-councils-and-schools- go-ahead-to-breach-bus-discrimination-law/ and at the start of 2020 was consulting on how to address the inaccessibility of the long-distance coach fleet when used for rail-replacement bus services, which brings coaches used for such services under the stricter train accessibility regulationshttps://www.railwaygazette.com/uk/orr-consults-on-accessibility-of- rail-replacement-coach-services/55425.article Special Service Request (SSR) Codes SSR codes relate specifically to assistance offered to passengers with reduced mobility.

This song was popularized in Twelve Variations on \\"Ah vous dirai-je, Maman\\" by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  History  According to Henri-Irénée Marrou, the origin of the melody is an anonymous pastoral song dating from 1740, with children's lyrics added relatively recently.Henri Davenson (pseudonym of Henri-Irénée Marrou), Le livre des chansons, Neuchâtel, Éditions de la Baconnière, 1944, p. 567. The melody was first published in 1761.George List, \\"The Distribution of a Melodic Formula: Diffusion or Polygenesis?\\", Yearbook of the International Folk Music Council, v. 10, (1978), pp. 33–52 In 1774, the earliest known printed publication of the lyrics together with the music was in volume two of by M.D.L. () published in Brussels, under the title \\"\\".The chronology is based on an account by Bob Kosovsky, librarian at the Music Division of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, 2001 Nursery rhyme The French lyrics of the nursery rhyme exist in several variations, of which the following one is one of the most common versions. {  Oh! Shall I tell you, Mama, What is tormenting me? Daddy wants me to reason Like a grown-up person, Me, I say that sweets Are worth more than reasoning. }  \\"La Confidence naïve\\"  The lyrics of the nursery rhyme are a parody of the original lyrics, an anonymous love poem, \\"\\" (\\"The naive Confidence\\"). {  Ah! Shall I tell you, Mama, What causes my torment? Since I saw Silvandre, Look at me tenderly; My heart says every moment: \\"Can one live without loving?\\" The other day, in a grove, He made a bouquet of flowers; He adorned my crook with it Telling me: \\"Beautiful brunette, Flora is less beautiful than you; Love less enamoured than me. Being made to charm, You must please, you must love; It is in the springtime of one's age, That it is said one should commit. If you tarry any longer, One regrets these moments.\\" I blushed and unfortunately A sigh betrayed my heart. The cruel one skillfully Took advantage of my weakness: Alas, Mama! a misstep Made me fall into his arms. I did not have any support Than my crook and my dog. Love, wishing my defeat, Put aside my dog and crook; Ah! That we taste sweetness, When love takes care of a heart! } Variations of the male lover's name found around the same time are Sylvandre, Lysandre, and Clitandre.

The book was published in 2008. Moxyland is narrated by four different characters, and each chapter focuses on one of the narrators and her or his own experience living in near futuristic Cape Town, South Africa and under an oppressive and pervasive government and media. Overall, Moxyland was well received. It was nominated for Sunday Times Fiction Prize. Characters Lauren Beukes dives into the lives of four main characters to exemplify the wide spectrum of social hierarchies that reside in Moxyland. Through these four characters, Beukes illustrates a society where technology rules with an iron fist and in doing so shows the limitations of freedom. Beukes uses first person to highlight central themes throughout the novel. Kendra Kendra, an art school dropout reinvented as shiny brand ambassador, known as a sponsor baby. Ghost girl (7)” is an artistic photographer with hopes of exposing her work. Kendra voluntarily becomes sponsored by a corporation. She is injected with experimental nanobots that enhance her physical and mental abilities. They are even supposed to stop any illnesses so that she will never be sick again. A side effect of the nanotechnology is that it makes Kendra addicted to a high- tech soft drink called Ghost. A glowing green tattoo in the shape of the corporation's logo appeared after injection that showed she was branded. Beukes uses Kendra's story to reveal the overwhelming power that technology has over Moxyland inhabitants because essentially Kendra becomes a walking advertisement. Lerato Lerato is a young female corporation worker who seems to have figured out the way in Moxyland. Lerato, unlike the rest of the main characters, lives comfortably in the cushions of corporate Moxyland. Lerato's autonomic success in Moxyland can be described as a rags-to-riches story. She became an orphan after her parents died of AIDs. She attended a corporation school for AIDs orphans and then was hired to work at a corporation. Her skills allow her to climb the professional ladder, and she uses her computer skills and inside job to aid Tendeka's cause. Tendeka Tendeka is a passionate, idealistic revolutionary figure in Moxyland. He is against corporations and corruption. He and Ash, his lover, create and conduct projects to help provide food and shelter to street children in Cape Town. Tendeka even goes as far as pretending to be married to a young pregnant girl in order to make a statement. His drive to promote change shows that not all people (mostly outsiders) are happy with the system. Tendeka refuses to accept the superior power of technology in this society. However, he sometimes contradicts himself because he fears being disconnected from society, even though he believes the way society is structured is unjust. Tendeka, along with the help of skyward*, participates in underground revolutionary events attempting to end technological totalitarianism in Moxyland. Toby Toby plays a role in all the other characters’ lives, whether positively or negatively, due to his narcissistic tendencies. This makes him a vital part to the progression of the novel. He runs a 24-hour vlog stream called “Diary of Cunt” which streams what he is going through. At times, he creates or looks for chaos so that his life can appear interesting, and so that he can be recognized by the media. This is difficult to do in Moxyland because citizens are constantly being bombarded with advertisements, therefore it is difficult to stand out. Toby uses his BabyStrange media coat, which records anything that crosses his path, to get film for his vlog. Toby is self-centered and his course of actions only emphasizes his concern for own personal gain. He eventually becomes involved in “real-life” gaming. Skyward* Skyward* is an anonymous omnipotent power in Moxyland, an online game. Skyward* aids Tendeka by supplying technology and inside information. Skyward* is a close ally to Tendenka and a strong supporter of Tendeka's cause. Setting Moxyland is set in a futuristic Cape Town, South Africa. The city is plagued by various economic, ecological, medical, racial, and socio-economic issues, and the populace is divided into tiers based on one's class, health, race, and ownership of a cellphone and a SIM card. A SIM card in a cellphone is a device, which contains one's bank account, personal information, and records. Without either a cellphone or a SIM card, one is cut off or “disconnected” from food, water, shelter, or any form of communication and transportation. Using a combination of this kind of technology and the media, the government maintains control over the metropolis and people. The advancement of technology in Moxyland focuses mainly on digital technology and biotechnology. As aforementioned, one's identity is contained in a SIM card, as well as an avatar. Online and virtual gaming are one of the hedonistic trends promoted by the media and used to distract the affluent and privileged upper class from the reality of AIDS, apartheid, and the social stratification created by technology and the ownership of a cellphone and a SIM card. Nanotechnology and genetic engineering are two forms of biotechnology popular with the people and pets alike. The former, however, is utilized by the corporations, government, and police to serve much darker purposes. Corporations hire people as test subjects for cosmetic and medical nanotechnology, and then dispose of them as soon as the next trend comes in. For the government and police, nanotechnology is another form of control. Genetically engineered and injected with nanotechnology, dogs called Aitos are used as a weapon to enforce the law and inspire fear in the people. In Moxyland, because of the corporate culture, government, and technology, the narrators are forced to either conform or live on the fringes and utilize the same technology against the system or solely for themselves. Plot Moxyland follows four protagonists in a near future South African dystopian society. The society relies heavily on technology. Citizens use SIMs in cell phones to access their homes, money, jobs, various areas of Cape Town, and is also used as punishment. If a citizen commits a crime, he/she can be “disconnected” which means “no phone, no service, [and] no life.” Being disconnected essentially means to be an outsider of society. The technologically advanced society, where online presence is important to life, considers this form of punishment worse than imprisonment. Throughout the novel, the main characters’ (Toby, Tendeka, Kendra, and Lerato) actions reflect the fear of being disconnected. Tendeka, an idealistic anti-corporation activist, is against the amount of power the government/ corporation has. By being dependent on technology, the government and corporations have a substantial amount of control over the fate of the citizens. The citizens’ power is limited due to this relationship. Although Tendeka fears disconnection, he enlists the help of Toby to protest against the government through a variety of methods. Most of these methods require the technological assistance of Lerato, a computer programmer who works for a major corporation. While Tendeka tries to change the way society works, Kendra is sponsored by a corporation. She consented to having nanobots injected into her body which claims to prevent aging and prevent sickness. The nanotechnology makes her addicted to a soft drink called Ghost. Unlike the other characters, Kendra does not try to fight against the way dystopian society works. She instead takes pictures of what is around her and does not take a stand. However, as the story progresses she is brought into the chaos due to Tendeka's orders from skyward*; an online contact from a game. Tendeka faithfully follows through believing his actions will provoke change, instead things take a turn for the worst and one begins to wonder who really is in charge. As the mechanics of the government's system is revealed, the true purpose of the government is exposed. Themes Biotechnology A prominent theme in Moxyland is biotechnology. The book starts out with Kendra being given some type of booster that basically turns her into a superhuman. Instantaneously Kendra is dehumanized through nanotechnology and transformed into a mindless experiment with an abnormally resilient immune system. This scene signifies the power that biotechnology pertains over Moxyland. Kendra's initial curiosity to this dystopian highlights that she is an outsider whom can only be controlled through means of biotechnology. The nanotechnology inside Kendra slowly eats away at her until she falls submissive to the futuristic technological control in Moxyland. Biotechnology is concurrently found in police dogs named Aitos. The fact that inhabitants are protected and enforced through bioengineered entities reinforces the theme of biotechnology as a method of authority. Beukes cleverly combines human traits and technology to illustrate how easily a society can become mechanized. Dystopian society The setting in Moxyland is a dystopian society which is controlled through technology. Beukes aims to create a futuristic world that seems far ahead of its time however, as one dives deeper into Moxyland it is easy to see the similarities between our world and Moxyland. The government has control over everything and people seemingly have absolutely no privacy or rights. The rich get ahead while the poor and middle class are left to struggle. There is clearly a totalitarian government in place. Cell phone and internet usage are heavily monitored to make sure that everything is happening in the exact way that the government sees fit. Social hierarchy Social hierarchy is one of the central themes of Moxyland with most of the characters laid out in a fairly linear progression of status. Some of the characters, like Toby and Lerato, have naturally high status, while others such as Kendra were granted somewhat of an elevated status due to her drug infusion. However, Kendra seems ironically out of place in “high class” environments. The opposite side of the spectrum includes the masses of less fortunate children and citizens who are abused by the system. People like Tendeka try to support their movement against the tyrannical dystopia, which creates more tension and confusion. Tendeka has a family and could be a fairly respectable member of society but instead crosses the line into the impoverished side to offer a helping hand. This blending of societal castes is evident throughout the book and creates interesting comparisons of characters when juxtaposed in the story. Another frequently cited theme is segregation. The world in which Moxyland is set divides most of the characters in the book, named or not, either into a privileged, upper class setting or a low-life caste with little rights. This plays in well with the underlying messages Beukes sends about race and breaking stereotypes in the novel. Moxyland ’s segregation is not necessarily by race but by socioeconomic status, yet it serves much the same point. The society is divided so much that rebellion is inevitable. Speaking to the injustices of authority in segregation, Beukes makes the point that a unified society can communicate and cooperate much more efficiently than a divided one. Criticism and reviews Moxyland was nominated for the South African Sunday Times Fiction Prize. Overall the book was well received in the cyberpunk genre. Some reviews state that it surpassed other attempts cyberpunk dystopian novels made. The message of the novel is considered dark, but was delivered with enthusiasm and wit. The plot of the story is seen as feasible, and it's chaotic complexion serves to as a warning of what could happen in the future if society's everyday indulgences are treated with too much disdain. Although Moxyland is considered a traditional cyberpunk book, reviews suggest it is refreshing and thought-provoking. Most reviews rave about the novel, but still touch on some flaws. Beukes wrote the novel in first person, yet some found the characters lacking in a distinct voice, which took away from the purpose of the literary technique. Considering Moxyland is Beukes first novel, reviewers did not consider it a huge impact to the overall experience and message of the novel.

The album contains 15 music tracks written by Ryo, and sung by Koeda, though officially Koeda is not a member of Supercell. Six of the tracks were previously released on five of Supercell's singles. Three different editions of the album were released: a regular CD version, a CD+DVD limited edition, and a CD+BD limited edition. Zigaexperientia peaked at No. 7 on the Japanese Oricon weekly albums chart. Seven of the songs were used as theme songs for various media: \\"My Dearest\\" and \\"Kokuhaku\\" were used as theme songs for the 2011 anime television series Guilty Crown; \\"Hakushukassai Utaawase\\" was used as the opening theme for the 2013 rebroadcast of the 2010 anime series Katanagatari; \\"Yeah Oh Ahhh Oh!\\" was used in a television commercial for the vocational school HAL; \\"Gin'iro Hikōsen\\" was the theme song to the 2012 anime film Nerawareta Gakuen; \\"The Bravery\\" was used as the second ending theme to the 2012 anime series Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic; and \\"Bokura no Ashiato\\" was used as the ending theme to the 2012 anime series Black Rock Shooter. Production Between 2009 and 2011, Nagi Yanagi provided the vocals for Supercell's releases, ending with Supercell's second studio album Today Is A Beautiful Day (2011). Following this, Supercell held auditions from May 25 to June 19, 2011 for the vocalist on the band's third album. The main criteria for the vocalist was his or her voice, as Supercell was not concerned with the singer's gender or age. Out of about 2,000 candidates, then 15-year-old female singer Koeda was chosen. Ryo began by thinking about what kind of melody would fit Koeda's aggressive voice. He brought together various guitars and sound effectors and started composing music for the album once he found the desired timbre using drop D tuning, which also influenced the writing of the lyrics. Ryo was partially influenced by watching Pink Floyd's Live at Pompeii concert film and bought a vintage Marshall guitar amp after seeing it used in the film. Ryo also cited Muse as an influence, wanting to make music that makes people smile. According to Ryo, the album's title is a portmanteau of the Japanese word for ego, (or ziga in kunrei or nihon romanization), and the Latin word for experience, experientia. Artwork The limited editions of Zigaexperientia came bundled with a 38-page full-color illustration booklet titled Supercell Works 3. The booklet contains color illustrations for the songs including lyrics, as well as comments by Ryo and Koeda, and production photos. The albums' packaging, designed by Yoshiki Usa, includes the song lyrics and the illustrations featured in Supercell Works 3. Excluding the final track \\"We're Still Here\\", each song is given an illustration by one of four artists, three of whom are members of Supercell. These illustrators are listed below with the track listing.

Blackwell and Company in Durham, North Carolina. that originated around the 1850s and remained in production until August 15, 1988.Roberts, B.W.C. and Snow L. Roberts. Bull Durham Business Bonanza: 1866-1940. Durham: Genuine Durham Press. 2002. Over the years, the brand often changed ownership, yet continued to be one of the most successful tobacco brands of all time. The brand is most commonly associated with its highly successful advertising campaigns that revolutionized the advertising industry. William Thomas Blackwell, an original investor and owner of the Blackwell Company, contributed greatly to the success of the product. Blackwell and his company’s tactics with the brand paved the way for other corporations to succeed through the acquisition of the Bull Durham trademark. The success of the product ultimately is due to the successful advertising campaigns that made Durham world famous, brought jobs to the city, and made Durham the tobacco capital of the United States.  History of W.T. Blackwell Company  W.T. Blackwell & Company Caricature  The J.R. Green Company  John Ruffin Green, a tobacco peddler of the 1850s, owned and operated the J.R. Green Factory, the original place of production for Bull Durham. Green found moderate success in his own endeavors. The Civil War brought business to the Green Company when soldiers on both sides of the war used Green’s tobacco. The brand then spread by word of mouth due to its popularity with the soldiers. Soon his business grew to be bigger than he could manage by himself.Paul, Hiram V. History of the Town of Durham, N.C. Raleigh, NC. Edwards, Broughton & Co., Steam Printers and Binders. Published 1884. Open Library  Start of the W.T. Blackwell Company  Green decided to expand his business in 1869, partnering with both Blackwell and James R. Day.Anderson, Jean Bradley. Durham County: part 1. Duke University Press. 1990. Google ebook. This partnership made the J.R. Green and Company a big name in the tobacco industry. Blackwell and Day originally paid 1500 dollars each for their shares in the company. Shortly after the initiation of the partnership Green died from tuberculosis. After the death, Blackwell purchased Green’s shares of the company and the trademark for “Genuine Durham Smoking Tobacco” from the Green family for $2292. This purchase is the official beginning of the W.T. Blackwell Company. In the following years Blackwell and Day expanded further. The two owners partnered in 1878 with Julian Shakespeare Carr, a North Carolina native and UNC graduate, to create a one third ownership for each man. This partnership proved to make the new Blackwell Company a highly successful venture.  Blackwell Company booms  Blackwell, Day, and Carr’s success can be attributed to the use of sound business practices, the creation and implementation of new technologies, and an extremely innovative advertising campaign. In the beginning years of the Blackwell Company they did not have enough of a work force or big enough facilities to fulfill the huge demand for their product. = A new factory = The three owners increased the size of the company by building a factory for production. This factory was completed in 1874 and resided on the corner of Blackwell and Pettigrew Street in Durham, North Carolina. Open Durham Article. Blackwell's Durham Tobacco / American Tobacco Co. March 24, 2008. Accessed November 4, 2013. This investment proved to be highly profitable for both the company and Durham. The factory brought more jobs to the city, creating a need for increased housing, public services, and other necessities. After the building of the factory the business continued to boom, so much so that the factory had to be expanded in 1879, only 5 years after the original building went up. = Tobacco warehouses = In addition to the extensive factory, the firm purchased and implemented the first tobacco warehouse in Durham in 1871. The market ended up selling more tobacco than any other place in North Carolina during its years of operation.Cameron, JD. A Sketch of Tobacco Interests. Oxford, North Carolina. 1881 W.A. Davis & Co publishers. It brought tobacco farmers to the city and allowed the company to acquire more tobacco than it previously could. No longer needing to ship tobacco from Virginia, the company expanded easily, continuing to boost commerce in Durham. Their tobacco warehouse influenced others to start tobacco warehouses of their own, contributing greatly to the city's success with tobacco. By 1876 there were nine tobacco warehouses in Durham, making it the most popular place in North Carolina to sell tobacco. = New Technology = Additionally, the implementation of various technologies helped the company grow. An example of this is the invention and implementation of the “Bull Jack,” a machine that fills, labels, and weighs bags of tobacco.Roberts, B.W.C. John Thomas Dalton and the Development of Bull Durham Smoking Tobacco. Durham, North Carolina. Solar Plexus Enterprises. 1977. Tobacco History Corporation Inc. The “bow tier,” another invention, also improved efficiency of production. John Thomas Dalton designed this machine to tie a bow around the tobacco filled bag, which reduced the annual cost of $172,000 for using manual labor to tie the bags to a third.Roberts, Ben. “Inventions in the Tobacco Industry.” Tar Heel Junior Historian. Pg. 46. Fall 2006. North Carolina Museum of History. These inventions allowed the firm to increase production to fulfill the high demand. Around the end of the 1870s and early 1880s the Blackwell Company experienced remarkable success. In 1869 it produced around 60,000 pounds of tobacco per year; by 1883 it produced over five million pounds.  The Blackwell Co and W.T. Blackwell change Durham  The Blackwell Company was the first big company to be located in Durham, sparked the tobacco craze within Durham. W.T. Blackwell, called the “father of Durham” by Durham’s first historian, changed Durham resident’s lives during his time with the Blackwell Company. When Blackwell started the first tobacco warehouse he “essentially built Durham into a center where tobacco farmers could bring their tobacco to be sold at high prices.” The tobacco warehouse industry spurred the need for the first banks in Durham, which came about in 1878. Around this time Blackwell also implemented the first telephones in Durham. The expansion of the tobacco industry gave rise to the need for a cotton industry and tobacco bag making companies, such as the Golden Belt Manufacturing Company. The firm's product, Bull Durham tobacco, gave rise to the city's nickname of the Bull City.Bell, William interview via NBC 17. Jul 8, 2010  The partners separate  An 1897 newspaper display ad for Blackwell's Durham Even though the company experienced high profitability, the three partners were to eventually fall apart and sell the company in order to pursue other ventures. This began when both Blackwell and Carr bought Day out of the company in 1878 for 50,000 dollars. Blackwell sold his shares next for a total of 300,000 dollars in 1883 to larger companies that would continue to promote the “Bull Durham” brand. Carr remained in the company and continued to encourage new advertising methods for Bull Durham. He eventually spread the brand to an unprecedented global level.  Blackwell Company and Bull Durham sold  Around the time when Blackwell left the company. competition with the up-and-coming Duke firm headed by James “Buck” Duke arose. Carr, however, stuck with the company and under his leadership “successfully developed mass production, excelled in creative advertising, and established world wide sales.” In 1898 Carr sold the majority of shares in the Blackwell Company and the rights to the “Bull Durham” brand to the Union Tobacco Company for 2,500,000 dollars, a price considered relatively cheap for the globally renowned brand Union acquired.“Leaders in Tobacco Lines.” The Washington Post. Dec 17, 1898. Proquest Historical Newspapers.  American acquires Bull Durham  Union Tobacco Company attempted to compete with the newly huge American Tobacco Company, a company formed out of the Duke firm, but found little success, and only a short while later were bought out by the American Tobacco Company. American then contained control of many of the most popular brands of tobacco and continued to develop the new advertising campaigns that are associated with Bull Durham Smoking Tobacco.  Advertising the “Bull Durham Brand”  This 1914 display ad in The Washington Post appealed to the experienced smoker who prefers to roll his own cigarettes—the \\"thirty-third degree smoke veteran\\". Bull Durham advertising represents the most expansive, revolutionary advertising campaign of its time. The Blackwell Company spent more money to advertise Bull Durham than any other company on any product. Large advertising campaigns at the time were considered to be extremely risky and fruitless in meriting more sales. Bull Durham ads proved this theory wrong, however, as the various campaigns became some of the most successful of the time and paved the way to modern day advertising.  Bull Durham Branding  Bull Durham Smoking Tobacco advertising had success due to the extent to which the product was branded. Green and later the Blackwell Company established the bull as the logo for “Genuine Durham Smoking Tobacco” in order to help do this. The logo of the bull evidently comes from “Durham Mustard” containers from Durham, England. With the establishment of the logo, the Blackwell Company extended the branding idea, putting the bull logo on all advertisements and labels. This logo would eventually be “one of most recognizable product advertisements around the country.”Druden, Robert F. “Bull Durham Tobacco.” NC pedia. 2006. Beyond the creation of the trademark icon, the “Established 1865” phrase appeared in association with Bull Durham. This helped to protect against trademark infringements, a very common occurrence due to the wild success of “Genuine Bull Durham Smoking Tobacco.” The repetition of advertisements with the bull and an established line helped to brand the name and make Bull Durham familiar to people of all ages.  Successful advertising campaigns  = Repetition = The Blackwell Company advertised Bull Durham Tobacco in an uncommon fashion for advertising of the time. One of the company’s first huge campaigns was the implementation of ads depicting the bull in magazines, trade journals, periodicals, and huge outdoor painted signs. The repetition of the bull and the wide circulation of these advertisements in a single newspaper or magazine quickly made the product a household name. = Outdoor advertising = In addition, the Blackwell Co was among the first to implement a large-scale outdoor advertising campaign around the country. The company partnered with the New York Sign Company and hired skilled ad painter, Jule Gilmer Körner, or “Rueben Rink,” builder of the landmark home Korner's Folly, as head of advertising. These ads started in the late 1870s and consisted of giant depictions of the bull with catchy sayings or a depiction of the price. Rink hired 4 teams of painters to go around the states and constantly paint ads. These signs were placed on huge billboards along major roads and rails, on the side of various buildings, and any other place that would be regularly seen. This was done in hopes that spreading the name of the product and the continuity of the ads would increase sales. = Roll Your Own Campaign = One of the most successful slogan campaigns for Bull Durham was the “Roll Your Own” campaign. The campaign came at an ideal time, as product sales were low due to the competition against the emerging pre-rolled cigarette.

October 1922 These ads appeared around the time of the Great Depression and showed the low price of only a nickel per bag as well as an elegant scene with finely dressed, upper class looking people. This advertisement campaign originally had doubters, yet quickly these doubts were taken away when sales exploded. The ads made many in the middle and lower class want to go out to buy Bull Durham in order to emulate the upper class. The campaign was tremendously successful, using the desire for a better life to boost sales. = Promotion Campaigns = In addition to slogans the Blackwell Company used promotions to increase sales of Bull Durham Tobacco. One promotion Blackwell ran gave soap to the merchants that sold their product. The company offered a bar of soap for each pound of tobacco a salesman purchased or 30 bars of soap for every 25 pounds purchased. Merchants could offer promotions in their own store, sell the soap, or use the soap themselves.The Blackwell’s Durham Tobacco Company. Telegram Salesmen bought Bull Durham in bulk in order to reap the rewards of the soap, in turn increasing the total sales of Bull Durham. The Blackwell Company also ran a coupon campaign that offered “free” goods to the consumers of the Bull Durham brand. Coupons were included in every pack of Bull Durham Tobacco. After a consumer had saved up a set amount of coupons he or she could cash them in for an item of equivalent value. For example, for 100 coupons and one dollar one could get a gold plated watch. There were over 180 rewards each costing a different number of coupons. This advertising style was unique for its time and increased sales as people had double the incentive to buy the product. This style of advertising is still seen in companies today. The company and especially Carr used every angle of advertising they could think of in order to promote Bull Durham. These advertising techniques were completely unique for their time and many of the methods have greatly influenced modern day advertising. Hitting the Bull Campaign  Bull Durham and Baseball  When the brand was in American Tobacco’s control they continued Blackwell’s success with advertising and implemented even more innovative campaigns. To do this American Tobacco Co wisely made the connection between baseball, America’s favorite pastime, and tobacco.Moris, Peter. \\"Personally, I have nothing against smoking\\": The lethal alliance between baseball and the cigarette. Nine. 18.1. p37. 2009 University of Nebraska Press. The connection came naturally, as during the early 1900s tobacco was a widely used amenity during games by the players. It is believed that this close link between Bull Durham and Tobacco may have triggered the creation of such words as bullpen. American Tobacco’s baseball advertisements made Bull Durham seem safe and familiar to baseball fans around the nation. = Hit the Bull Campaign = American Tobacco also set up wooden bull ads in nearly every major league stadium around the states during the 1912 season, furthering Bull Durham’s publicity. American gave a 50-dollar prize to any player that hit the bull sign set up within the walls of the outfield. In addition, they offered free tobacco to any player who hit a home run. This advertising campaign generated much publicity and was highly successful, despite American Tobacco having to give away over 23,400 dollars worth of goods. This, while a large sum of money for the time, is only about 5 cents given away to the baseball players for every 700 sacks of Bull Durham that were sold.Cassen, Herbert N. “My Choice of the Month’s Ad.” Advertising and Selling. Aug, 1918. PA36&dq;=%22bull+durham+tobacco%22&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=ViVoUpuOOo7i4 AOQg4HICQ&ved;=0CDkQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q;=%22bull%20durham%20tobacco%22&f;=false The target audience, publicity generated, and consistency proved to make the “Hit the Bull” campaign an extremely successful venture.  Impact on the Advertising Industry  Before Bull Durham advertising, a large marketing campaign was unheard-of and considered highly risky. However, the Blackwell Co and later American Tobacco proved this theory wrong entirely. The product achieved high sales and thus profit by creating a high demand for the product through advertising. The Company showed future businesses the success that can come from branding a product and making it familiar to consumers. The advertising for Bull Durham proved to be a revolutionary process. Many of the concepts first used to advertise Bull Durham are still used by marketers today.

Biodiversity offsetting is a system used predominantly by planning authorities and developers to fully compensate for biodiversity impacts associated with economic development, through the planning process. In some circumstances, biodiversity offsets are designed to result in an overall biodiversity gain. Offsetting is generally considered the final stage in a mitigation hierarchy, whereby predicted biodiversity impacts must first be avoided, minimised and reversed by developers, before any remaining impacts are offset. The mitigation hierarchy serves to meet the environmental policy principle of \\"No Net Loss\\" of biodiversity alongside development.\\"Biodiversity offsets in theory and practice\\" (Bull et al., 2013)\\"Biodiversity offsets and the challenge of achieving no net loss\\" (Gardner et al., 2013) Individuals or companies involved in arranging biodiversity offsets will use quantitative measures to determine the amount, type and quality of habitat that is likely to be affected by a proposed project. Then, they will establish a new location or locations (often called receptor sites) where it would be possible to re- create the same amount, type and quality of habitat. The aim of biodiversity offsets is not simply to provide financial compensation for the biodiversity losses associated with development, although developers might pay financial compensation in some cases if it can be demonstrated exactly what the physical biodiversity gains achieved by that compensation will be. The type of environmental compensation provided by biodiversity offsetting is different from biodiversity banking in that it must show both measurable and long-term biodiversity improvements, that can be demonstrated to counteract losses. However, there is so far mixed evidence that biodiversity offsets successfully counteract the biodiversity losses caused by associated developments, with no evidence that offsets have yet successfully compensated for the loss of forested habitats, and evidence that offsets have sometimes successfully achieved no net loss of biodiversity in wetland habitats.\\"The ecological outcomes of biodiversity offsets under “no net loss” policies: A global review\\" (zu Ermgassen et al. 2019)  Relevant conservation activities  Biodiversity offset projects can involve various management activities that can be demonstrated to deliver gains in biodiversity. These activities very often include active habitat restoration or creation projects (e.g. new wetland creation, grassland restoration). However, also viable are so-called \\"averted loss\\" biodiversity offsets, in which measures are taken to prevent ecological degradation from occurring where it almost certainly would have happened otherwise. Averted loss offsets might involve the creation of new protected areas (to conserve fauna species that would otherwise have disappeared), the removal of invasive species from areas of habitat (which otherwise would have reduced or displaced populations of native species), or positive measures to reduce extensive natural resource use (e.g. the offer of alternative livelihood creation to prevent activities leading to deforestation). Any activities that do not result in a positive and measurable gain for biodiversity would not generally be counted as part of a biodiversity offset. For instance, if a developer funds ecological conservation research in a region that they are impacting through a project, would not count as an offset (unless it could be shown quantitatively how specific fauna and flora would benefit). instead, this would be a more general form of compensation. Note that biodiversity offsets can be considered a very specific, robust and transparent category of ecological compensation.  Receptor sites  Under many offset systems, receptor sites are areas of land put forward by companies or individuals looking to receive payment in return for creating (or restoring) biodiversity habitats on their property. The biodiversity restoration projects are financed by compensation from developers looking to offset their biodiversity impact. The resulting change in biodiversity levels at the new receptor sites should be equal to, or greater than, the losses at the original ‘impact site’; in order to achieve no net loss – and preferably gain – of overall biodiversity. Such systems often rely on the buying (by developers) and selling (by landowners) of conservation credits. However, characteristics of receptor sites can vary across different jurisdictions. In some countries, for instance, land is primarily state-owned, and so it is the government that owns and manages biodiversity offset projects. For biodiversity offsets in marine environments, receptor sites might be subject to multiple management organisations and not necessarily owned by anyone. Controversially, some biodiversity offsets use existing protected areas as receptor sites (i.e. improving the effectiveness of areas that are already managed for biodiversity conservation).  Requirement to offset biodiversity  Biodiversity offsets are required by law in many jurisdictions (Madsen et al., 2011). Countries including the US, Australia, New Zealand, UK and parts of Europe use biodiversity offsetting as an optional or mandatory (depending on the country) biodiversity conservation management tool within their planning systems. Biodiversity offsetting is also being considered by some Latin American countries (Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Chile) and by South Africa. Another key driver of biodiversity offset projects globally are the Performance Standards required by the International Finance Corporation (IFC). For any projects which the IFC or any of the Equator Banks 'Equator Banks' finance, under Performance Standard 6, developers must deliver No Net Loss (or in some cases, a Net Gain) of biodiversity. Finally, a number of companies implement biodiversity offsets after setting voluntary policy commitments to achieve 'no net loss' or a 'net positive impact' for biodiversity overall associated with their operations.\\"A review of corporate goals of NNL or NPI on biodiversity\\" (Rainey et al., 2014) This is part of a broader effort for the private sector to manage biodiversity.Report on Business & Biodiversity (Bull et al., 2015)  Compensatory mitigation in the US  No Net Loss policy (and consequently, biodiversity offsetting) has its origin in US legislation, specifically in the Water Act from the 1970s. This piece of legislation required 'no net loss of wetland acreage and function', leading eventually to the creation of mitigation banks, where wetland credits are bought and sold.US Environmental Protection Agency guidance The US also has a Conservation Banking policy in which credits representing areas of habitat for protected fauna species are traded.US Fish & Wildlife Service factsheet In the US, offsetting tends to be called 'compensatory mitigation'.  Offsetting in Australia  Much of the scientific research into biodiversity offsetting outside of the US has been conducted by Australia, especially organisations such as CEEDCEED homepage and CSIRO.CSIRO homepage Biodiversity offset policies have become established in a number of Australian states (especially Victoria and New South Wales), and there is also a federal biodiversity offset policy.Australian Gov. Department of Environment States tend to operate biodiversity banking mechanisms at the regional level. Major species include koalas, the red‐tailed black‐cockatoo, and the green and golden bell frog which required 19 times more habitat to achieve no net loss.  Offsetting in the UK  In the UK, compensation (for environmental harm caused by development) in the form of biodiversity offsetting is currently an optional (non-compulsory) tool for developers. Those developers choosing to incorporate biodiversity offsetting practices into their project plans can do so once the normal planning mitigation hierarchy has been followed, which involves taking steps to avoid and reduce environmental harm, where possible, at the development, or 'impact', site. Biodiversity offsetting is only applicable to land that has been approved for development, which means it does not apply to protected sites such as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) or national nature reserves (NNRs). In addition to protected areas, vulnerable or irreplaceable habitats (such as ancient woodland) are also exempt from biodiversity offsetting. In 2011, six biodiversity offsetting pilot schemes were started in England by the British Government to test the process. They were run in partnership with local groups and private companies and are located in Warwickshire, Essex, the Ribble Valley, at three sites in Devon, in Nottinghamshire. and Doncaster (http://www.doncaster.gov.uk/services/planning/biodiversity-offsetting-in- doncaster). In September 2013, the British Government published a Green Paper containing plans for further incorporation of biodiversity offsetting in the UK planning system. (Public consultation period: 5 September – 7 November 2013). In March 2019, the British Government announced that it will mandate biodiversity net gain as part of its forthcoming Environment Bill, requiring 'developers to ensure habitats for wildlife are enhanced and left in a measurably better state than they were pre-development.'  Economic value  Biodiversity is increasingly seen as having economic value due to growing recognition of the world's finite natural resources and through the benefits of ecosystem services (nature providing clean air, food and water, natural flood defences, pollination services and recreation opportunity). Placing financial value on biodiversity has created a marketplace for retaining and restoring habitats. Financial gain from biodiversity offsetting is brought about through the sale of conservation credits by landowners. Individuals or companies who are looking to receive financial payment in return for creating or enhancing particular wildlife habitats on their property can have their land valued in conservation credits by a biodiversity offsetting broker who will then register their credits for sale to developers looking to offset any residual impact to biodiversity from their approved developments. Developers can also find the business of biodiversity offsetting appealing financially as the compensation payment for their project's residual biodiversity impact is handled in one agreement and the landowner receiving that payment (and therefore the habitat re-creation duties) is responsible for the biodiversity restoration and management thereafter. The cost may represent a small proportion of a developer's budget and is often outweighed by a project's long-term gains. As corporate social responsibility is often part of larger companies’ business priorities, being able to demonstrate environmentally responsible practices can be an additional incentive. Biodiversity offsetting based upon showing the economic value of lost habitat is highly controversial.Spash, C. L. 2011. Terrible economics, ecosystems and banking. Environmental Values, vol. 20, no. 2, 141-145. The schemes proposed for the UK have been regarded as failing to protect biodiversity and indeed leading to further losses in the prioritisation of development over conservation.S. Sullivan & M. Hannis, \\"Nets and Frames, Losses and Gains: Value Struggles in Engagement with Biodiversity Offsetting Policy in England\\" (The Leverhulme Centre for the Study of Value, University of Manchester, Manchester, 2014). The basic economics has been described by ecological economist Clive Spash as leading to the “bulldozing of biodiversity” under an approach that regards optimal species extinction as being necessary to achieve economic efficiency.  Conservation credits  The cost of re-creating an area of habitat affected by a development proposal (impact site) can be calculated and represented as a number of conservation credits that a developer could purchase in order to offset their biodiversity impact. Land put forward for investment to re-create impacted biodiversity (receptor site) is also calculated in conservation credits (to account for the cost of creating or restoring biodiversity at that particular site and to cover the cost of its long-term conservation management). This situation enables the buying (by developers) and selling (by landowners) of conservation credits. Government approved (quantitative and qualitative) metrics should be used to calculate the number of conservation credits that can be applied to each site, in order to maintain accuracy and consistency in the value of a conservation credit.  Motivation  A decline in global biodiversity due, in part, to land use changes is the motivation for creating a system within the planning process that tackles unavoidable and residual impact to biodiversity. Formal evaluation of impact to habitat, wildlife and other natural considerations is often required of developers ahead of receiving approval for a project to go ahead. This can often be in the form of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA), which are commonplace within the work of Government planning authorities. EIAs look at how proposed projects may impact upon the environment in its broadest sense, covering the traditional ‘green’ aspects alongside any social and economic issues; and can result in mitigating and compensatory packages which form part of a project's overall proposal for approval. The topic of biodiversity is likely to be looked at as part of an EIA, but in conjunction with many other overriding elements. Biodiversity offsetting, as an assessment and compensatory process, can either sit inside or outside of EIA and aims, specifically, to tackle habitat – and therefore biodiversity – loss.

It was initially printed in State Printing Shop in Prizren during the issues 1 to 60. Since issue 61 it was printed in Prishtina Regional Printing House of the People's Front.Gazeta Rilindja In the beginning, it had only four pages, being published weekly until June 27, 1948. After that it begins to come out twice a week, on Sundays and Thursdays. Then, from November 1958 starts out as a daily paper (beside Fridays). By the year 1964, it appears every day in a 20-page standard format, while on Saturdays and holidays in a 24-32 page format. On September 5, 1990, the Serbian government banned its publication, with the entry of NATO forces, on June 12, 1999 it appears again. It was undoubtedly one of the best sold newspapers in the Albanian sphere. Its maximum circulation reached up to 234,000 copies during the New Year holidays.

It shared some elements with Steve Jackson's previous role-paying game, The Fantasy Trip, as they both centered on tactical combat played out on a hex grid, both used a point-based character creation system, and both used only six sided dice. Publication history Man to Man: Fantasy Combat from GURPS was written by Steve Jackson, and published as an 80-page book with cardstock miniatures by Steve Jackson Games in 1985. As the GURPS system was still being developed at the time, SJG initially released the combat system, rather than the entire game, in order to meet the deadline for Origins 1985; the result was Man to Man: Fantasy Combat from GURPS. Man to Man was soon followed by a single supplement, Orcslayer (1985). The original GURPS Basic Set (1986) included the combat rules of Man to Man.

His parents were Esmond Wickremesinghe and Nalini Wickremesinghe née Wijewardena. His father was an ex-Samasamajist lawyer who became a press baron taking over the Lake House Group of newspapers. His grandfathers were Cyril Wickremesinghe and D. R.Wijewardhena. Shan completed education from Royal College, Colombo. Then he graduated from the Faraday and North London Polytechnic Institute of Higher Education in England with the subject Television and Audio Engineering. Shan has three younger brothers – Ranil, Niraj, Channa and one younger sister, Kshanika. His uncle Lakshman Wickremasinghe was the former Bishop of Kurunegala. His brother Ranil served as Prime Minister in three terms: from 1993 to 1994, from 2001 to 2004 and from 2015 to 2019.

Asian Mirror, Retrieved on 08 February 2016 . Shan is married and the couple has one daughter, Ishini. Career During the working days of industrial electronics, there was an American show about Colombo television in the 1950s while he was a student. When he watched it, he was attracted to television and radio. During his four years as secretary in the Radio circle of the school, Shan taught the younger students about radio and how to make it in practice. Meanwhile, his father realized that he was working towards the radio in this way whereas Shan was sent to \\"Shard House School\\" in England to learn more. But it closed in about a year. Students were sent to other colleges to study and Shan was referred to North Texan College. During this period, he met a Sri Lankan person, Ivan Siriwardena. On Ivan's acquaintance, Shan learned to make televisions from an old Indian television maker, which was during the era of black-n-white television. In the meantime, he was able to pass the Amada Television Sound exam, which gave a certificate that he could sit at home and do TV shows. While returning Sri Lanka from vacation in 1968, Vernon Correa of the Broadcasting Corporation gave me a hint. Correa said that according to Article 35 (17), a television channel can be licensed in Sri Lanka. They went to meet the then Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake to talk about the matter along with Ranjith Wijewardene. However, the licence could not pass during Senanayake's government. Later, Sirimavo Bandaranaike saw Shan's presentation and gave the opportunity to telecast the Non-Aligned Movement. During 1968/69, Shan brought Sony television to Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, late president J.R. Jayawardane's government also did not licensed Shan's proposal. After many arguments and debates, he was asked to pay Rs. 100,000 before December 1, 1979 and told to start on April 13. Otherwise the license would be revoked. But without the technical equipment building, he was in a lot of trouble. During the constructions, a man died while working on a 45-foot tower. On 13 April 1979, the young monks of Gangarama came to recite Pirith and Sri Lanka's first television station was commenced at 6.30 pm with the name Independent Television Network (ITN). ITN is the first ever terrestrial television channel to be telecast in Sri Lanka. However, ITN was able to provide its broadcasting services under the leadership of Shan only for eight weeks, where President Jayewardene’s Government converted ITN to a State owned property on June 5, 1979 by a special gazette. Later, Shan established TNL TV on 21 June 1993. TNL became the first private television broadcaster in Sri Lanka. In 2018, TNL celebrated its 25th anniversary. In 1970, Shan launched a record production company called \\"Sangeetha\\" where the first disc was made for Gypsies Sunil Perera. He also produced discs under the Surya label. On 15 December 2015, a felicitation ceremony was organised at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) by Telshan Networks (Pvt) Ltd. to felicitate the Chairman of TNL Shan Wickremesinghe. In 2016, Shan received the Lifetime Achievement Award from President Maithripala Sirisena at the Rupavahini State Awards. In 2018, Polgahawela Broadcasting Center of TNL has been suspended by Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) due to broadcasting without obtaining a Frequency License since 2013. It was further stated that the location license and antenna pattern license have not been obtained for that.

Early life Born in New York City, the eldest daughter of John Douglas and Elizabeth Horton was raised in the city of her birth with the exception of several years spent on a farm near Poughkeepsie, New York. She studied art design at the City Institute of New York City for a time before circumstances forced her to fall back on her greater talent as a writer to help support her family. In 1853, Douglas and her family moved from New York City to Newark, New Jersey, where she would remain a resident for the balance of her life.New Jersey Historical Society Library Retrieved December 1, 2013Who's Who in the World, 1912, p. 394 Retrieved December 1, 2013 Career Douglas began by submitting short stories and poems to local publications. In time her stories appeared in editions of The New York Ledger, Saturday Evening Post and the Lady’s Friend Magazine. Her first novel, In Trust, was published in 1866 and sold some 20,000 copies.

Howard Fuller (also known as Owusu Sadaukai), Bertie Howard, and several other African American activists in North Carolina founded the school in response to the 1969 Allen Building Takeover on Duke University's campus.Fuller interview It operated from October 25, 1969 to June 28, 1973. One of the main reasons the school closed was that political conflicts damaged the school's reputation, making it more difficult to acquire funding.Belvin, 2004 Due to financial setbacks, the school operated for only three years.Belvin, 2004  Origins  The Black Power Movement shaped the political climate for the Allen Building Takeover, which led to the creation of MXLU.Benson, 2010, p. 1 The movement inspired the formation of Duke University's Afro-American Society (or AAS). Many Black Power activists in the American South adopted the separatist ideologies of Malcolm X.Benson, 2010, p. 1 Before the Nation of Islam allegedly assassinated him in 1965, Malcolm X lent credence to militant tactics, leading to a movement for racial equality through any means necessary, including violence and self- defense.Benson, 2010, p. 71 In early 1969, the AAS issued a set of over ten demands for the university's administration, most of which reflected the black students' dissatisfaction with the inadequacy of civil rights on campus.Benson, 2010, p. 110 The organization negotiated at first with the university's president, Dr. Douglas Knight, who reluctantly agreed to consider the implementation of an Afro-American Studies program.Belvin, 2004, p. 27-28 President Knight was away on a trip to procure funds for a black studies program, one of the \\"Black Demands\\", but the AAS grew impatient and decided to stage a protest.Belvin, 2004, p. 28 On the morning of February 13, 1969, the AAS organized an occupation of the Allen Building, the location of all the records of previous students.Belvin, 2004, p. 28 Knight refused to comply with some of the demands, and he issued an ultimatum to the black student protesters: the school would call the police if they did not leave.Belvin, 2004, p. 29 They countered by threatening to burn the university's records if police were to arrive.Benson, 2010, p. 100 Later that day, a large group of white students who sympathized with the occupants congregated outside the building, so Duke called the police. The police tried to evacuate the building with tear gas, and a riot ensued. The occupants acquiesced to the administration's demands for fear of expulsion, and eventually, a trial placed forty-eight of them on probation.Belvin, 2004, p. 48 The protest revealed to the black community that the administration was not sympathetic enough to its demands. After the Allen Building Takeover, some civil rights activists in Durham believed that Duke's administration did not satisfactorily address the demands of its black students, especially regarding the integration of \\"Afro- American studies\\" into its curriculum.Belvin, 2004, p. 33 One of these activists, Howard Fuller, conceived of building an alternative school for primarily African studies whose administration and student body would be predominantly black. He was able to do this by working with The Foundation for Community Development, and its executive director, Nathan T. Garrett. He listed a fifteen-member board of trustees, which included Bertie Howard, Sandra Philpot and Timothy Harris, in the charter. They were all residents of Durham.Benson, 2010, p. 183 Donations allowed Howard Fuller to begin building MXLU. James Forman, the spokesman of the Black Economic Development Conference (or BEDC), wrote a document called the \\"Black Manifesto\\" demanding reparations from whites for certain projects benefiting the black community, including black universities. The BEDC published it, asking for $500 million from white churches and synagogues.\\"Black Manifesto\\", Archives of the Episcopal Church In accord with the \\"Black Manifesto\\", the diocese of the North Carolina Episcopal Church gave Fuller $45,000, and several anonymous sources donated smaller amounts of money.Anderson, 2011, p. 374 However, the donation was an outrage to some white members of the church, and the resulting controversy made further donations unlikely. The school had only $12,000 left by November 15, so Fuller sought other sources of revenue. He set up fundraising campaigns in major American cities: Los Angeles, San Francisco, Detroit, Houston, Washington D.C., New York City, Pittsburgh, Chicago, and Atlanta.Anderson, 2011, p. 75 However, he could not extend the school's budget beyond $82,000, the total amount of donations he received.Belvin, 2004, p. 75 The tuition for MXLU was $300 per year, and financial aid was available, but the school expected students who could pay more to pay more.Belvin, 2004, p. 47 Admissions staff interviewed applicants, and about fifty students enrolled. Most of them were political activists in their previous schools who were expelled for their involvement in protests.Hopkins, 1970 The school held its opening ceremony on October 25, 1969, and classes began two days after the inauguration.Belvin, 2004, p. 64 The administration formally named itself the \\"Council of Elders\\" soon after the school opened.Belvin, 2004, p. 48  Administration  MXLU moved to a different location a year after it opened. For the 1969-70 academic year, MXLU was located on 426-428 East Pettigrew Street in Durham, NC.Anderson, 2011, p. 374 Then, in October 1970, it moved to 708 Asheboro Street (now known as Martin Luther King Drive) in Greensboro, NC. The school needed to relocate due to the construction of the Durham Freeway through the district of Hayti.Belvin, 2004, p. 75 Nonetheless, the school cited the reason for the move as accommodating more students.Barnes interview MXLU chose Greensboro because of the city's higher political activity and historical significance as a hotspot for sit-ins during the 1960s.Benson, 2010, p. 132 Initially, fifty-one students enrolled at MXLU.Fergus, 2009, p. 30 After moving to Greensboro, sixty-five students from seventeen states attended the school, but by the end of the third year, only two dozen students remained.Grant, 1972, p. 7 Numerous expulsions contributed to the drastic decline in the student population.Barnes interview MXLU grew much of its own food and made efforts in community outreach. At first, the school required female students to prepare their own meals. After a few months, both men and women received meals from two local restaurants.Belvin, 2004, p. 68-69 Teachers operated the Early Educational Center for preschool children in the community and the Children of Africa program for older youth.Grant, 1972, p. 7 The school was associated with the Young African Warriors program and Willie Grimes Community School.Grant, 1972, p. 7 At one point, Fuller tried to expand the school by buying the Sedalia campus of the Palmer Memorial Institute, \\"a black prep school founded by Charlotte Hawkins Brown in 1902\\", which was failing due to financial problems.Belvin, 2004, p. 76-77 However, he was unsuccessful because a trustee of the Palmer Memorial Institute resigned in protest.Belvin, 2004, p. 76-77 Then, a petition by a biracial interest group against the sale ensued, and it eventually put an end to the transaction.Belvin, 2004, p. 76-77  Curriculum  The school's goals centered on the concept of Black Power and Pan-Africanism.Belvin, 2004, p. 19 Initially, Fuller designed MXLU's curriculum with two different types of courses. For the first ten months, students took courses in Nation-Building: Independent African Civilization, Slavery, Neo-Colonialism, Colonialism, and Independent African World; Swahili, French, and Spanish for foreign languages; and other courses for physical education. Then, students and faculty would stay in Africa for two months, followed by Areas of Concentration. Student would have up to ten months to complete the technical courses in order to pursue careers as the following: \\"food scientists, tailors, architects, engineers, medics, cadre leaders, communications technicians, physical developers, teachers, black expressionists, administrators, and linguists.\\" Finally, MXLU would grant students internships so that they could practice their respective fields before graduating after the fourth year.Belvin, 2004, p. 70 After moving to Greensboro, MXLU changed its program to three years. The first year would consist of mandatory courses in the following areas: \\"History, Development of Black Political Thought in the U.S., Language, Culture Expression, Speech, Physical Development, and a series of year-long seminars.\\" The school also offered only foreign African languages during the first year: Swahili, Hausa, and Yoruba, one of which would be required, and another permitted to count as an elective. In the second year, students received training in one of the following technical fields: \\"Communication, Technology, Engineering, Food Science, Bio-Medicine, and Pre-School Education.\\" Students would graduate after teaching at the school in their last year.Belvin, 2004, p. 70 The school advertised that it offered \\"Agriculture, Bio-Medicine, Communications Technology, and three Engineering options—Construction, Electrical, and Mechanical.\\" According to Fuller, these areas of expertise would prepare a student \\"to contribute to African people in the U.S. or on the Continent of Africa.\\"Belvin, 2004, p. 70 In an article in the Philadelphia Tribune, MXLU staffer Jim Grant described the school's curriculum in detail. According to Grant, MXLU's students did not get weekends off unless there was an emergency. They spent two hours on \\"physical development\\" every morning, which includes a three-mile run. Each student must devote eighteen hours every week to focus on his or her skill area and \\"eight hours in selective technology.\\" The remaining time, students studied and performed physical labor.Grant, 1972, p. 7 MXLU's leaders claimed that an MXLU education aligned with the idea of Pan-Africanism. Grant summarized the tenets of Pan-Africanism as the following:Grant, 1972, p. 7 # All black people are considered as misplaced Africans. # All black people everywhere are linked historically by a common heritage and common oppression. # Land is necessary for the control of the destinies of all African people. This can only be brought about by the development of a strong and unified Africa. # An economic system must be set up which reflects traditional communalism transformed to fit modern technological advances and fair distribution of wealth and responsibility. # True freedom can only come about through the destruction of capitalism, colonialism, imperialism, neo-colonialism, and white European nationalism.  Experimental pedagogy  Malcolm X Liberation University was a novel experiment in higher education. A document in the Cleveland Sellers Jr. Papers in the Avery Institute College of Charleston highlighted the primary goal of the new school: \\"The existing system of education does not respond to the needs of the Black community; it does not provide an ideological or practical methodology for meeting the physical, social, psychological, economic and cultural needs of Black people. Malcolm X Liberation University is a direct response to this vacuum.\\"Wilson, 2008, p. 2 Furthermore, most universities in America based admissions on standardized test scores, such as the SAT. MXLU, on the other hand, challenged this notion by affirming that \\"any black person who accepted the goals and objectives of MXLU\\" would be eligible to apply.Belvin, 2004, p. 47 The school's administrators could not come to a consensus over the definition of these goals, and internal ideological disputes divided the school into factions, ultimately leading to its demise. MXLU's curriculum challenged the traditional American education system in several ways. Most universities assess students based on their scores on classwork and tests, but MXLU encouraged educators to reexamine the effectiveness of an academic grading system. For example, the school allowed students to apply their knowledge to a greater degree, including in Africa.Belvin, 2004, p. 65 Since teachers would travel to Africa with the students, teachers evaluated students on whether their projects were successful. Consequently, students did not receive grades. Instead, they could only graduate after demonstrating proficiency in community involvement.Wilson, 2008, p. 15 By mostly accepting black students to promote Black Power, MXLU drew people's attention towards the ethicality of reverse discrimination. The school's administration anticipated criticism for reverse discrimination because MXLU mostly admitted black students and hired black staff members. In defense, the Council of Elders responded in writing, \\"MXLU would be open to all who desire an education which would prepare then to work with groups of black persons. Because black students are more committed to the cause of solving the problems of being black in America, the student body would be mostly black.\\"Belvin, 2004, p. 49  Demise  Fuller could not garner sufficient funds after the end of 1969 because of the controversies surrounding him and MXLU's sources of funding.Belvin, 2004 First, many people in the Episcopal Church criticized it for abiding by the \\"Black Manifesto\\", and they deemed Fuller guilty by association. In another instance, a rumor that Fuller used MXLU as an arsenal sprung up from an article published in a local newspaper.Belvin, 2004, p. 82-83 The reporter claimed that firefighters found guns in a school's dorm and that ammunition exploded in the fire.Belvin, 2004, p. 82-83 The name \\"Malcolm X\\" in the school's name aroused further suspicions that Fuller was planning a violent uprising against Durham's white population.Belvin, 2004, p. 56 Another reason MXLU ran out of funds was that the school failed to garner support from large organizations in the South.Belvin, 2004, p. 80 Acceptance by larger black universities or civil rights groups was crucial because they would help not only to fund the small school, but also to defend it from criticisms of major opponents. Instead, Fuller made a series of statements that turned away many of his potential supporters.Belvin, 2004, p. 67 Kelly Alexander, head of the North Carolina chapter of the NAACP, did not support MXLU because he believed it was too radical.Belvin, 2004, p. 80-81 Others, like Whitney Young of the National Urban League, claimed to be against the separatist motives of the school. He said: \\"We must not mislead our young people. We are playing for keeps. Swahili is an interesting language but we are not using it on IBM cards right now. Let's quit kidding white people that we're going to get on a boat and go back to Africa.\\"Belvin, 2004, p. 81 These opponents believed integration would be necessary in order to gain social, political, and economic equality. However, during an interview on television, Fuller said: \\"This isn't a 'back-to- African' thing\\", so he did realize that Marcus Garvey's idea of moving back to Africa was unfeasible.Wilson, 2008, p. 3 Political differences within the Council of Elders did not allow the administration to reach a consensus over the structure of MXLU's curriculum. According to Dr. Claude Barnes, these disparate ideologies caused the school to fall apart.Barnes interview The school's administrators shut out MXLU from the rest of the world so that they could shield it from the white media, but the isolation also discouraged potential donors from contributing to an institution that lacked transparency.Belvin, 2004, p. 82 On June 28, 1973, Owusu Saudakai (Howard Fuller changed his name earlier) officially closed MXLU.Belvin, 2004, p. 77 He noted that the school would only remain open if it could meet the needs of the people' and that he would not keep it going 'just because it was our thing.Belvin, 2004, p. 77  References   Footnotes   Works cited     Further reading  Pan-Africanism in the United States Memorials to Malcolm X African-American culture African and Black nationalism in the United States Defunct private universities and colleges in North Carolina Educational institutions established in 1969 Educational institutions disestablished in 1973 Post–Civil Rights Era African- American history 1969 establishments in North Carolina 1973 disestablishments in North Carolina ","title":"Malcolm X Liberation University"},{"id":"41255714","text":"On 23 May 2013, two coordinated attacks perpetrated by Islamist affiliates targeted the two Niger towns of Agadez and Arlit, the first being a military base the other a French-owned and operated uranium mine. In the first attack on the Niger military base, in which eight attackers participated, 23 soldiers and a civilian were confirmed dead by the next day. The second attack by two suicide bombers also claimed a worker at the mine. The Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa (MUJAO) later claimed responsibility, saying \\"We attacked France and Niger for its cooperation with France in the war against Sharia (Islamic law)\\". They also promised more attacks to come in retaliation for Niger's involvement in the Northern Mali conflict. Reports suggested Islamist leader Mokhtar Belmokhtar of being the \\"mastermind\\" of both attacks, supervised by his brigade the \\"Signatories of Blood\\". These were the first such attacks within the country in Niger's history. Agadez attack At 5:30 local time during morning prayers, the first of the two suicide attacks hit Agadez, a city situated in northern Niger, when a group of eight extremists attacked the local army barracks. A suicide car bomber en route to the barracks drove through the base's barricades and exploded inside the barracks, killing several soldiers. This car bomb was then followed by a twin vehicle that entered the base while opening fire on soldiers. A lengthy gun battle followed as Islamists took hold of the barracks dormitory and an office. In a matter of hours the fight spread throughout the base and into the streets where a civilian was killed in the cross-fire. By late afternoon, extremist elements took refuge in the barracks' dormitory, taking five soldiers hostage. The hostage-takers threatened to blow themselves up with explosives but negotiated with the army. By the next morning, three of the hostages had been killed before Niger troops, with help from French special forces based in Mali, raided the building, killing two of the extremists and capturing one. The two surviving hostages were freed. According to the Niger army, 23 soldiers were killed in the Agadez base attack, plus a foreign-training Cameroonian soldier. In addition, all eight of the attackers were confirmed killed. Rumors spread about a ninth attacker being taken alive. Arlit attack A few minutes following the Agadez attack, two suicide bombers disguised in military fatigues drove their car into an Areva uranium mine in Arlit, the largest such mine in the country, operated by a French company. The car exploded in front of a pick-up bus carrying workers to the facility. Besides the two suicide bombers, one worker was killed and sixteen others were injured. The plant was forced to shut down from the damage caused by the blast. The main target was said to be French officials operating at the plant.

As of 2008 Jews lived in many Houston neighborhoods and Meyerland is the center of the Jewish community in the area. History Temple Beth Israel, now Heinen Theatre of the Houston Community College Until 1880 Houston had a smaller Jewish population than Galveston Island, then the cultural center of the state. In 1844, a plot of land in Houston had been purchased for a Jewish cemetery. In 1850, the Jewish community in Houston had 17 adults and in 1854, the Orthodox Beth Israel Congregation opened in a former house that had been converted to a synagogue. By 1860 the number of Jewish adults grew to 68, and that year there were 40 Jewish children.Bell, p. 216. In the 19th Century the Jewish population moved into the First and Second wards and later settled in the Third Ward.Bell, p. 217. Congregation Beth Israel was first established in a frame building on LaBranch Street near the Third Ward settlement. In the 19th Century the Franklin and Navigation area in the Fifth Ward and the area around Washington and Houston street in the Sixth Ward received Jewish settlers from Eastern Europe. As of around 1987 the areas in the historic Fifth and Sixth Wards no longer have significant Jewish populations. Roselyn Bell, author of the \\"Houston\\" entry in The Jewish Traveler: Hadassah Magazine's Guide to the World's Jewish Communities and Sights, wrote that the Houston Jewish community was \\"much more shtetl-like than it is today\\". Beginning in 1880 many Eastern European Jews moved to Houston; they moved into wards two and three.Kaplan, Barry J. (University of Houston). \\"Race, Income, and Ethnicity: Residential Change in a Houston Community, 1920-1970\\". The Houston Review. Winter 1981. pp. 178-202. CITED: p. 186. They integrated with German Jews, differing from Eastern European Jews in the East Coast. Around that time the Russian-Polish Adath Yeshurun synagogue and the majority Galician Dorshe Tov synagogue, both Orthodox Jewish synagogues, had been founded. Adath Yeshurun merged into Congregation Adath Yeshurun in 1891. The Galveston Plan, an early 20th Century plan that called for sending Eastern European Jewish immigrants from heavily populated East Coast areas to less densely populated areas between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains, sent many Jews to Houston. In 1903 a Zionist organization in Houston opened. In 1908 The Jewish Herald-Voice began publication. In 1915 a Jewish Workmen's Circle opened. In the 1920s Jews began to settle in the Washington Terrace and later the Riverside Terrace areas in the current Third Ward area. Many Jewish institutions such as synagogues remained there until the end of the 1950s. Temple Beth Israel moved to the Riverside Terrace area in 1925 and Temple Beth Yeshurun opened in the same area in 1945.Kaplan, Barry J. (University of Houston). \\"Race, Income, and Ethnicity: Residential Change in a Houston Community, 1920-1970\\". The Houston Review. Winter 1981. pp. 178-202. CITED: p. 187. Jewish families moved to Riverside Terrace in the 1930s since they were not allowed to settle in River Oaks.Feser, Katherine. \\"Much history flows through Riverside\\". Houston Chronicle. July 9, 2002. Retrieved on April 18, 2009. Allison Wollam of the Houston Business Journal stated that, at one point, Riverside Terrace \\"was once on the same affluent level as the swanky River Oaks area\\".Wollam, Allison. \\"Riverside Terrace bucks housing slowdown\\". Houston Business Journal. August 15, 2008. Retrieved on April 18, 2009. \\"It's becoming common practice for homes in the Riverside Terrace area — a historic Inner-Loop neighborhood bounded by Scott, North MacGregor, Almeda and Wheeler[...]\\" During that period the neighborhood hosted the houses of the prominent Weingarten, Finger, and McGregor families. Around the 1874 Beth Israel became a Reform Judaism synagogue. Congregation Beth El was founded in 1924. It was the first Conservative Judaism synagogue founded in Houston. In 1925 it occupied the former Beth Israel building. Adath Yeshurun later merged with Beth El and became Congregation Beth Yeshurun. In the 1930s many Jewish refugees from Germany moved to Houston. In 1943 Temple Beth Israel announced that people who espoused Zionist ideals were not allowed to be members, so Emanu-El was formed by people who disagreed with the decision. After World War II, more Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe moved to Houston. By the 1950s many Jewish families moved to Southwest Houston and Jewish institutions relocated there. The first subdivisions to receive Jews were neighborhoods along North Braeswood and South Braeswood. Subsequently, Meyerland began receiving Jews. From 1955 to around 1987 the Jewish population in Houston increased by 300%. By the 1970s Jews moved to Fondren Southwest in Southwest Houston and the Memorial and Spring Branch areas. By 1987 there were around 42,000 Jews in Greater Houston and Jews were located in many areas of Greater Houston. In 2017 Hurricane Harvey damaged the Meyerland area, along with the three synaoguges with the largest congregations, the Jewish community center, various Jewish private schools, and the Jewish senior home. Jewish population Evelyn Rubenstein Jewish Community Center As of 1987, there were about 42,000 Jews in Greater Houston and about 2.5% of the City of Houston was Jewish. In 2001 the figure was 47,000 Jews in the Houston area. The Jewish Federation of Greater Houston made another population count in 2016, indicating that 51,000 Jews live in Greater Houston.2016 Houston Jewish Community Study, Berman Jewish Data Bank, The Jewish Federations of North America, 2016. Houston Jews had origins from throughout the United States, Israel, Mexico, Russia, and other places. Because the population of Jews in Houston increased so severely between 1955 and circa 1987, many of the Jews in the circa 1987 count were new to Houston. Roselyn Bell, author of the \\"Houston\\" entry in The Jewish Traveler: Hadassah Magazine's Guide to the World's Jewish Communities and Sights, wrote that this would make it, among other Jewish populations in the U.S., \\"medium-sized\\" and comparable to that of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Philadelphia had a Jewish population more than five times larger than that of Houston, which had surpassed Philadelphia as the fourth largest city in the U.S. Bell wrote that the smaller relative population results in a combination of \\"the close-knit feeling of a middle- sized town with big-city sophistication and large-scale institutions\\". Jewish communities Meyerland As of 1987 Jews lived in many communities in Houston. In 2008 Irving N. Rothman, author of The Barber in Modern Jewish Culture: A Genre of People, Places, and Things, with Illustrations, wrote that Houston \\"has a scattered Jewish populace and not a large enough population of Jews to dominate any single neighborhood\\" and that the city's \\"hub of Jewish life\\" is the Meyerland community.Rothman, p. 358. Bell wrote that Southwest Houston is the \\"Jewish core of town, if not exactly an ethnic stronghold\\" and that synagogues had opened in Clear Lake City, Kingwood, and The Woodlands. Synagogues Congregation Beth Yeshurun As of 1987 there were over 20 synagogues in Greater Houston. there were over 40 synagogues in Greater Houston. As of 1987, Congregation Beth Yeshurun, a Conservative Judaism temple, and the Reform Judaism congregations Beth Israel and Emanu-El are the largest synagogues in Houston. The Orthodox Judaism community includes several congregations: Chabad Lubavitch Center of Houston, the Sephardic Beth Rambam Congregation, Young Israel of Houston, Meyerland Minyan, and the Sephardic synagogue Torah Vachesed. The United Orthodox Synagogues congregation formed in 1961 as a consolidation of three synagogues. It occupied the same building near Meyerland since its groundbreaking that year. The building flooded during Memorial Day in 2015 and Tax Day in 2016. After Hurricane Harvey damaged the buildings in 2017, in December of that year the congregation's board decided to have the sanctuary and school building demolished; it would use the Freedman Hall building as the center of worship for the time being. the congregation has 300 people. Congregation Emanu El Temple, using a Mid-Century Modern architectural style, was built in 1949. By 2011 the Shul of Bellaire, a Chabad-Lubavitch, was established by Yossi Zaklikofsky in January 2011. It was the first Chabad-Lubavitch center in the city of Bellaire. Congregation Or Ami is located in Westchase,  PDF in west Houston, in proximity to Greater Katy. the rabbi is Gideon Estes. There are two Jewish places of worship in The Woodlands, Congregation Beth Shalom, established circa 1984. it had about 130 families, and it belongs to Reform Judaism. Its affiliated organizations are the Association of Reformed Congregations and the Union of American Hebrew Congregations. Chabad of The Woodlands was established in 2011 by Rabbi Mendel and Leah Blecher. It is a branch of the worldwide Chabad Lubavitch movement, offering traditional-style services to contemporary Jewish families. Chabad of The Woodlands inaugurated and sponsors the annual Chanukah on Market Street celebration, and established the first Jewish preschool in the area. Chabad Pearland Jewish Center is the first Jewish center of worship in Pearland, established by Yossi and Esty Zaklikofsky in 2009. In addition to Pearland, it also serves Alvin and Friendswood. Temple Beth Tikvah, the Jewish Center of Clear Lake, is in the Clear Lake area. There are also synagogues in Humble and Victoria.

Today, HCBS programs represent the preferred method of services delivery rather than institutionalization. The following focuses specifically on Utah's HCBS waiver program serving individuals with intellectual disabilities or related conditions (ID/RC). This particular waiver is administered to Utahns through the Division of Services for People with Disabilities (DSPD). DSPD's stated mission is to \\"promote opportunities and provide supports for persons with disabilities to lead self-determined lives.\\"“Services for People with Disabilities.” Utah department of human services, n.p., last modified October 21, 2013, retrieved from: http://www.hsdspd.utah.gov.

History  Originally called the Office of Handicapped Services, DSPD was created in 1979 to manage what is now called the Utah State Developmental Center. This is the state-funded institution for people with disabilities in American Fork, Utah. In 1983 Congress added section 1915(c) to the Social Security Act. This addition provided for the creation of Medicaid waivers. It also outlined the contractual obligations of states choosing to establish waiver programs with Medicaid. Waiver programs were considered a positive step as they provided a way for people to lead less-restricted lives in the community. Studies that supported waivers cited cost-effectiveness as the main reason why they should be enacted. It was argued that providing the same institutional care in the community cost less. In 1986 Utah's waiver program for individuals with disabilities was established. The Office of Handicapped Services was tasked with administering the waivers.Department of Human Services. DSPD Coming Together Division of Services for People with Disabilities 2012 Annual Report, n.p., last modified September 9, 2013, retrieved from: http://dspd.utah.gov/pdf/DSPD_Annual_Report_FY2012.pdf. The agency began moving people who could safely receive care services in the community. Those who preferred not to live in an institution were moved out of the State Developmental Center. In 1998 DSPD introduced the Self-Administered method of services delivery in response to a large public demand for a more family- directed system of accessing services. Self-Administered services have allowed families to hire individuals they know to provide community care for loved ones.  Organizational structure  Much of the administration of services to qualifying recipients is done through contractual partnerships beginning at Medicaid's top agencies. Contractual arrangements continue down through those entities working directly with service recipients. The Utah Department of Health, Division of Health Care Financing (Utah's Medicaid administering agency) contracts with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (the federal government’s Medicaid administering body) in order to implement the section 1915(C) qualifying ID/RC HCBS waiver. This contract is known as the State Implementation Plan.“Utah Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) Waiver Programs.” Utah Department of Health. n.p., last modified July 25, 2013, retrieved from: http://www.health.utah.gov/ltc. It details exactly how the waiver is to be administered and defines the contractual obligations that Utah and the Department of Health, Division of Health Care Financing have agreed to. These obligations include important assurances that Medicaid-funded services will promote the health and welfare of all participants. DSPD is directly responsible for monitoring the application of these Medicaid funds (appropriated every year by the state legislature) to ensure that they follow the guidelines established in the State Implementation plan. The Division of Services for People with Disabilities is one of many agencies serving under the umbrella of the state's Department of Human Services. DSPD has one Division Director in charge of overseeing the work of six program managers. These program managers are tasked with overseeing one of the six following tasks: Finance and Contracts, Services, Quality Management, Research and Business Systems Management, Research Development and Technical Assistance, and the Autism Pilot Program.Department of Human Services. (2013). Division of Services for People with Disabilities Organizational Chart (Data file). Retrieved from http://dspd.utah.gov/pdf/DSPD-org-chart.pdf. The delivery of actual services to the individuals DSPD serves is given to private contractors. The division licenses private corporations and non-profit organizations to provide the long-term care services. Each of these entities establishes an individual contract with the division to provide services which meet the same guidelines set forth in the State Implementation Plan. As of 2012, Rise Services, Inc. is the largest DSPD contractor, providing services totaling 14.4 million dollars. In 2009 casework for DSPD services recipients was privatized. DSPD caseworkers are now licensed as private contractors and also establish their own contract with the division to provide case management.  Program funding  Funds for Utah's ID/RC HCBS waivers are appropriated by the state legislature every year. The Division Director and Director of the Department of Human Services are often heavily involved in advocating for the Division's funding needs. The legislature appropriates a portion of the state's Medicaid funds to DSPD. This state portion is then matched with federal funds by the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) — every $1 of state allocation is matched with $2.44 in federal Medicaid funds.Department of Human Services. DSPD Coming Together Division of Services for People with Disabilities 2012 Annual Report, n.p., last modified September 9, 2013, retrieved from: http://dspd.utah.gov/pdf/DSPD_Annual_Report_FY2012.pdf. DSPD's total operating budget has, despite slight fluctuation, increased steadily in recent years. In 2008, the total budget was $191,746,381. The 2013 fiscal year authorized budget was $215,316,800. As of 2012, the Division served 4,985 Utahns with disabilities. This included approximately 200 individuals who still lived in the Utah State Developmental Center. The services that each of these individuals receive differ based on their needs. There are many available service options. DSPD itself employs 120 people, most of whom are tasked with providing support to the private contractors who actually provide the direct support to program recipients.  Collaborative relationships  DSPD often coordinates and collaborates with other state agencies to provide care for recipients of ID/RC HCBS waiver serves. Perhaps the strongest inter-agency partnership exists between the Division and the Division of Child and Family Services. These two state agencies often work together on crossover issues regarding their two respective populations. The most common crossover issue involves children who have experienced traumatic abuse or neglect and demonstrate extreme behavioral issues. Unfortunately, victims of acute abuse and neglect also experience significant developmental delays and thus qualify for services. In cases where these children have no other family or guardians, DSPD steps in to provide long-term care. Often, the child remains in the custody and guardianship of Child and Family Services. Division and Child and Family Services staff work closely together in these cases to ensure that services are administered appropriately and that the child is safe and healthy. DSPD also works closely with many non-profit organizations to coordinate care and support to its clients. One such group is Utah's Center for Assistive Technology (UCAT). This organization provides the community with expertise and assistance regarding equipment and adaptations like wheelchairs, ramps, and alternative communication devices.“Utah Center for Assistive Technology Services.” Utah Center for Assistive Technology, n.p., last modified October 21, 2013, retrieved from http://ucat.usor.utah.gov/services. Before approving extraordinary funding for equipment purchases, DSPD will refer clients to UCAT. This allows the Division to utilize UCAT's unique expertise to source the equipment from the community or assist them in pinpointing the exact need. This helps DSPD avoid misuse of taxpayer funds. The most unusual non-profit agency that DPSD works with is People First, a self-advocacy organization for people with disabilities. This organization has many chapters in Utah. They help their members advocate for issues surrounding intellectual disabilities. The Division often includes People First members and leadership in stakeholder meetings. Together, they deliberate on how services are delivered and pertinent human rights issues. DSPD also encourages the private entities who deliver waiver services to include People First members' input on improvements. The Utah Association of Community Services comprises over 40 companies.“Utah Association of Community Services  Businesses Serving People with Intellectual Disabilities since 1971.” Utah Association of Community Services. n.p., last modified October 21, 2013, retrieved from: http://uacs.org. This association has worked closely with the Division to petition the legislature for funding in recent years. The independent Support Coordinators Association is an advocacy organization representing private caseworkers. This organization often works closely with DSPD on issues regarding how best to deliver services and coordinate oversight efforts between case managers and the Division.  Program evaluation and research  The HCBS waiver program is still in its early stages. Therefore, research is not abundant or conclusive. The Center on Disability provided a statewide overview regarding waiting lists for HCBS waivers per state. Utah has approximately 2,355 persons on the Medicaid 1915c HCBS Waiver waiting list. This data was provided from one of the most recent survey results conducted in 2011.\\"Number of Persons on Medicaid 1915(c) HCBS Waiver Wait Lists, 2011.\\" Community Living Indicators. Center On Disability. Web. 26 Nov 2013. . \\"Medicaid Home and Community Based Services Options.\\"WellCare Medicaid Policy Papers. (2013): n. page. Web. 26 Nov. 2013. . This chart is critical to demonstrate the unmet needs within the state of Utah; although the HCBS Waiver Program is fledgling in age when compared to other federal programs, there are significant waiting lists and an unmet need in a majority of states. The emphasis on Home and Community Based Services was initiated by a 1999 Supreme Court decision. This ruling created a significant change in prior policy in order for disabled individuals to receive care in non-institutional settings. Since 1999 the number of HCBS waivers has had a steady increase and demand by clients. Some critical data on HCBS waivers comes from research done by the AARP Public Policy Institute, which has collected 38 studies regarding HCBS programs. The studies evaluated the cost effectiveness of HCBS programs versus institutional care. The studies compared a variety of state programs, and although Utah was not one of them, the data collected was valuable. The overall core finding regarding the HCBS waiver program lacked concrete documentation to prove absolute cost savings when utilizing the HCBS system over the institutionalized one. Each state benefited from this study. Although evidentiary cost savings are unclear, the studies did consistently demonstrate lower per-individual, average costs for those placed on the HCBS programs.Fox- Grage, Wendy. \\"State Studies Find Home and Community Based Services to be Cost-Effective.\\"AARP Public Policy Institute. AARP. Web. 26 Nov 2013. . One specific article from the University of Michigan dated back to 1997. This article focused on utilizing regression analysis by applying nursing home patients' length of stay, then estimated the co-efficient from this study to HCBS patients for their results. This study not only was dated, but could not run a complete analysis on actual HCBS patients only. Another article dated from 2000 evaluated the HCBS waiver program. The main point of this study found that care in the community instead of institutionalized care resulted in a higher quality of care and improved quality of life at lower costs for those clients on a HDBS waiver.Lutzky, Steven, Lisa Maria B. Alecxih, Jennifer Duffy, and Christina Neill. \\"REVIEW OF THE MEDICAID 1915(c) HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES WAIVER PROGRAM LITERATURE AND PROGRAM DATA.\\" Final Report for the Department of Health and Human Services Health Care Financing Administration. 204874 (2000): n. page. Web. 26 Nov. 2013. . The study also stated that the effectiveness of HCBS waiver programs has not been rigorously evaluated to date. A 2003 study was conducted in Colorado's Traumatic Brain Injury Waiver Program. The analysis found that the waiver recipients had more case management, physical therapy, and group home services than the recipients in the control group. However, the results were inconclusive, as the study lacked adequate control, and significant differences between either groups were marginal. The one tangible result that all the research continually focused on is that community-based services, such as those provided by the HCBS waiver programs, provided a higher quality of life for disabled individuals. It can also be argued that the research upholds the idea that the cost per individual was lower for those enrolled in the HCBS waiver program than for those attending institutions for similar services. The difficulty when collecting research and data for programs with fewer years of operation is concrete evidence for sufficient analysis. It is also critical to keep in mind that the HCBS waiver program varies state by state with regard to demographics, funding, state policies, and so forth. The most effective changes come as each state analyzes the overall functionality, success, and performance of their individual HCBS waiver program.  Future  In recent years, DSPD has faced steep obstacles in its mission to care for Utahns with disabilities. The most acute and recent challenge involved funding issues which arose after the economic downturn of 2008. As state tax receipts fell in the months following the crisis, the legislature began making difficult decisions about how to fund state programs. The Division was asked to make do with a significant budget reduction. DSPD decided that the best way to reduce operational costs was to privatize casework. This allowed the Division to preserve critical services. By the end of 2009, all but a handful of caseworkers had transitioned from direct employment with the state to a private contractor. In both 2010 and 2011, the Division met additional budget shortfalls with staffing reductions, to avoid the reduction of critical services to waiver services recipients. It has been challenging for the Division to meet the same workload demands with less staff and resources. In the future, DSPD will face the challenge of growing support for privatization. Voices within the state legislature have questioned the continued operation of the State Developmental Center with taxpayer funds. As it is more cost- effective to provide the same level of care in the community, the continued use of such institutions is a paradox. During recent economic hardships, the state legislature explored the possibility of privatizing the Developmental Center.Public Consulting Group, “Feasibility Study on the Privatization of Portions of the Utah State Hospital and the Utah State Developmental Center” (paper presented to the Utah State Legislature Executive Appropriations Committee, Salt Lake City, Utah, August 6, 2010).

Broadcast on DuMont Television Network's flagship station WABD (later WNEW, now WNYW) in New York City, the series aired in 1947, broadcast at 8:45pm ET on Wednesdays. The 15-minute series was sponsored by Bonded Auto Sales, and was hosted by Don Roper, who was assisted by Evelyn Peterson. Although broadcast only on a single station, it is notable as an early example of a television game show. The show returned to the air in 1971, with Dennis James as host, and ran for one season from 1971 to 1972. Format In the episode broadcast on 20 November 1947, the names of several viewers who wrote in were plucked out of a bowl, and were each phoned for the answer to a question. The questions were based on slides on landmarks in New York, which were to be identified. Correct answers gave the winner $5; all contestants received a turkey whether they answered correctly or not. Reception Billboard magazine described the series as \\"low-budget\\", but also said that \\"none of the ideas in the program is essentially new, but they are well put together and run smoothly\\" and that \\"it is a watchable program and obviously tuned to the budget of the medium local sponsor\\". Episode status Although examples of WABD's local shows are known to exist from as far back as 1948, such as Swing Into Sports and Photographic Horizons, none are known to exist from 1947. The series is most likely lost, and likely was never kinescoped in the first place, as kinescoping was still a very new technology. The syndicated version likely exists, at least in part, in Dennis James's personal archives; James maintained copies of every show he ever hosted in the archive during his lifetime.

Side effects  Acute methoxphenidine intoxication has been reported to produce confusion, hypertension, and tachycardia that was responsive to treatment with intravenous lorazepam, methoxphenidine has also been associated with three published fatalities and one case of impaired driving. Psychotic episodes have also been reported, including a murder in June 2014. Legal status As of October 2015 MXP is a controlled substance in China. MXP is also banned in Sweden. In Canada, MT-45 and its analogues were made Schedule I controlled substances. Possession without legal authority can result in maximum 7 years imprisonment.

The phrase politics-administration dichotomy itself does not appear to have a known inventor, even after exhaustive research, the combination of words that make up the phrase was first found in public administration literature from the 1940s with no clear originator.Overeem, Patrick (2012). The Politics- Administration Dichotomy: Toward a Constitutional Perspective (2nd ed.). CRC Press. P. 10. . Google eBook. Retrieved on November 27, 2013.  History  Portrait of Woodrow Wilson 1919 Woodrow Wilson is credited with the politics- administration dichotomy via his theories on public administration in his 1887 essay, \\"The Study of Administration\\". Wilson came up with a theory that politics and administration are inherently different and should be approached as such. Wilson wrote in his essay in regards to public administration: “The field of administration is a field of business. It is removed from the hurry and strife of politics.... Administration lies outside the proper sphere of politics. Administrative questions are not political questions. Although politics sets the tasks for administration, it should not be suffered to manipulate its offices.”Wilson, W., 1887, “The Study of Administration”. Political Science Quarterly, Reprinted in 1997 in Classics of Public Administration, 2d ed. Shafritz, J, and Hyde, A, Chicago: Dorsey Press. With these words, Wilson started a debate that has been going on for decades and continues to this day. The politics-administration dichotomy is an important concept in the field of public administration and shows no signs of going away because it deals with the policy-makers role as an administrator and the balancing act that is the relationship between politics and administration.Reza Tahmasebi & Seyyed Mohammad Mahdi Musavi. (2011). \\"Politics-Administration Dichotomy: A Century Debate,\\" Revista Administratie Si Management Public, Faculty of Administration and Public Management, Academy of Economic Studies, Bucharest, Romania, vol. 2011(17), pages 130-143, November 27, 2013. http://www.ramp.ase.ro/en/_data/files/articole/2011/17-09.pdf This essay is considered to be the first source to be analyzed and studied in the public administration field. Wilson was primarily influenced by Richard Ely and Herbert Adams who taught at Johns Hopkins University.  Perceived Advantages  Woodrow Wilson's politics-administration dichotomy can potentially be substantial in sustaining a strong productive government. The complexity, difficulty level and ample multiplication of governmental functions can be seen as a main component in the cause to implement the politics-administration dichotomy. Due to Wilson's lack of faith in republican self-government and the overwhelming amount of “selfish, ignorant, timid, stubborn, or foolish” persons whom the “bulk of can vote,” this model provides a solution that would counteract the majority of the incumbent voters. By employing the elite philosophical leaders to improve, shape, condition and sway public opinion, politics-administration dichotomy, if carried out in an unselfish manner leaves little to no room for error. Woodrow Wilson's model created one of the first concepts of checks and balances, which is one of the most predominant systems of democratic accountability used to shape the United States government. Nevertheless, “separating the will of the people from politics” could be extremely beneficial and institutionally separating administration from politics could prove valuable in sustaining government accountability. Politics-administration dichotomy also leads to political neutrality. The blurring of \\"politics\\" and \\"policy\\" has cause to the advocations to dismiss \\"partisan politics\\" rather than \\"policy politics.\\" The importance of neutrality in politics and policy are established within the politics- administration dichotomy.  Criticism  Standard definition is too narrow . If politics includes all of what we know as policy making, then the dichotomy would bar administrators, presumably including city managers, from participation. The dichotomy of policy and administration was a conceptual distinction underlying a theory of democratic accountability. It was not intended to guide behavior, it was intended as a behavioral prescription directed against contemporary practices of machine politics. The strict definition is the model. It is not conceptually possible to have a one way dichotomy that keeps elected official out of administration but allows administrators to be active in policy. The dichotomy model standing alone is an aberration. By Wilson making the statement, \\"Government should be run like a business,\\" he thereby opened up many loop holes for the capitalist society to exploit the government for things they didn't actually have. This statement ends in a very dangerous uncharted territory for people now. Based on the fact government could be run like a business. The concept \\"everyone has a boss\\" with creating the business like mindset running our country it makes everyone have to answer to someone (higher on the totem pole) than the other, it creates a sense of working for your job when you are supposed to be working for the people whom you represent. So now, instead of implementing policy to help the people, administrators and politicians are more concerned about who is funding/appointing than they are worried about the common man. That isn't just the biggest problem for Politic administration Dichotomy it is a huge problem for the sustainability of our government and the world.

Smith is best known for his work with at-risk youths, especially in his use of boxing for those suffering from substance abuse problems and anger management issues. He is also a 6th degree black belt and a professional boxer. His progression into martial arts and boxing happened while he was attempting to raise funds for the community in Dulwich Hill, where he is the parish priest. Smith is also a published author and has taken a very public stance on various human-rights issues, most especially the Palestinian occupation and the current war in Syria where he opposes all forms of Western military intervention. Smith has been twice awarded Marrickville Citizen of the Year award and was nominated for Australian of the Year in 2004 and 2009. In 2012, he broke the world record for the most continuous rounds of boxing. Early life Smith was born in Newtown, Sydney, in 1962 to Bruce and Joan Smith – the oldest of three boys. His father was a well-known Evangelical Anglican priest, public speaker and theological lecturer. Smith completed an arts degree with honours in philosophy in 1984 before beginning studying theology at Moore College in 1985. He completed two degrees in theology in 1988 and was ordained a priest in the Anglican Church of Australia in 1989. Career After ordination, Smith spent two years in the parish of Miranda (in Sydney’s south) before being appointed to Dulwich Hill (in Sydney’s inner- west) in December 1990. He has continued as parish priest at Holy Trinity since then. When Smith became the parish priest in Dulwich Hill it was known as an area that was rife with drugs. In 1991, he began to focus on working with young people with drug problems in the area and opened up the church hall as an area where local youth could do fitness and martial arts training. In 1993, he founded the Order of the Fighting Fathers as a way of encouraging other priests and religious people to use the fighting arts to help young people overcome their addictions and lead fuller lives. Holy Trinity's youth centre went full-time in 1994, with the primary aim of being a safe place for local young people where they were provided with a safe place to be in with counseling and spiritual input. In 2013, a young client burnt down the centre and this received widespread media coverage. Smith moved the centre to premises provided by the Dulwich Hill Salvation Army. Smith's work in the community led him to twice be awarded the Marrickville Citizen of the Year award, in 1997 and 2009. In 2005 and 2009 he was also nominated for Australian of the Year, particularly for his work with young people battling substance abuse. In 2001, a short film was made about Smith, which is titled The Good Fight. Smith has helped to organise numerous peaceful demonstrations, including a protest against the deportation of Sheikh Mansour Leghaei in 2009. He also marched and spoke at numerous rallies calling for justice for Gaza and Syria. In 2011, he and Sheikh Mansour planned to launch an Internet radio station on the theme of peaceful inter-faith relations. In 2011, Smith began training in an attempt to break the world record for the longest period of continuous boxing. On 1 April 2012, he boxed continuously for eight hours - against 66 opponents over 120 three-minute rounds. He succeeded in breaking the world record and received extensive media coverage, including from Fox Sports. The previous world record before this attempt was 26 rounds. On 19 February 2016, Smith returned to professional boxing to raise money for youth programs and became Australia's oldest ever professional boxer. Author Smith is also a published author and wrote the book Sex, the Ring and the Eucharist. The book is a series of snapshots from Smith's life and is known for its straight talking and honesty and Smith being also critical of the established church and the legal system. Even with the criticism, it is said there is a pervading sense of faith and hope running through the book.

It is greyish coloured in appearance with flowers ranging in colour of orange-red, red and perianth pink from July to November.Wilson, A. J. G. (Editor). (2000).

Sydney: University of New South Wales. The flowers themselves are long and hairless on the outside, with a ‘bearded’ inside. The style, approximately 30 mm, is released from a split in a flower. It has thin sharply pointed, linear leaves approximately 12–25 mm long and 1-1.5 mm wide. The leaves have a downy underside, with thick margins that are in-rolled. The leaves are quite rigid and are slightly clustered. The fruit is 12–17 mm long and is in the shape of a glabrous obovoid-ellipsoidal follicle that is tapered to a style base. The seed has a short apical wing on a linear seed which is 7.5-10.5 mm long and 2.7-3.1 mm wide.  Taxonomy  This species is not closely related to any of Australia’s other Grevillea species. However, it does have phylogenetic resemblance with other Grevillea species that are found within semi-arid and temperate arid regions of south western Australia, such as Grevillea decipiens, Grevillea sparsiflora, and Grevillea acuaria. G. kennedyana is not well adapted for deep sandy soils because of this, the species is seen as a relict species that has been effected by the expansions of the arid interior of Australia. G. kennedyana was named after Mrs Mary B. Kennedy of Wonnaminta by Ferdinand von Mueller.  Distribution and habitat  Restricted distribution of Grevillea kennedyana Grevillea kennedyana has a restricted distribution and is only found in the northwest corner of New South Wales (NSW) and the southwest corner of Queensland (QLD), which are arid areas and receives variable and unreliable rainfall. As of 2000, the plant was found in six geographic locations. Ninety per cent of the populations are found in the Sturt National Park which are highly fragmented. It can sometimes be found in dry and rocky watercourses, but is most often found in clusters on rocky jump-ups and colluvial slopes of rocky mesas with weathered silcrete rocks and loamy soils. The most dense populations of this species are found on the lower slopes that have high water retention because of deep colluviums. The altitude of the known locations of G. kennedyana is between 140 m and 200 m and is found on slopes that vary from 10˚, which is relatively flat to a steep slope of 75˚. Populations are found under very little or no tree and shrub canopy cover. The plant communities that are found with G. kennedyana have not been sufficiently studied. However, it is currently known to be found with the spiny fan-flower (Scaevola spinescens), whitewood (Atalaya hemiglauca), Acacia and Eremophila species and occasionally black oak (Casuarina pauper). A low ground cover of chenopodiaceae is often present.  Life history  Not much information is known on the ecology and biology of G. Kennedyana. While it is not known how long the plant lives for, it is presumed that it has a long life, as it is a common adaptation for perennial plants that are found in the arid zone due to the irregularity of rainfall in the area. The plant is capable of recruitment by rhizomes, making the current individuals clones. However, the plant has also been observed to resprout from adventitious buds from the base of the stems and seeds. New growth can be stimulated by physical damage to the plant. Flowering is seen to occur 2–4 months after a major rainfall event, however during dry seasons flowering is irregular. The necessary amounts of rainfall required for flowering are still not known. Fruit is believed to mature 6–8 weeks once fertilisation has occurred. The pollinators are not known, but they are believed to be birds. The seeds are then dispersed soon afterwards, however the dispersal mechanisms are still not fully understood, but it is believed to be aided by the wings that are found on the seeds. The period of seed dormancy is another unknown factor which needs to be investigated.von Ritcher, L., Azzopardi, A. Johnstone, R. and Offord., C. (2001). Seed germination in the rare shrub Grevillea kennedyana (Proteaceae). Cunnunghamia, 7(2), 205-212. Depending on its similarity to other Grevillea species it is possibly that it can remain dormant for up to four years. Any recruitment that does occur via seed is believed to be event driven, relying on the combination of above average rainfall and the appropriate temperature. Seedlings that are becoming established in the summer months may be greatly affected by high temperatures and the absence of soil moisture.  Current conservation status  Under Schedule 1 Part 2 of the Commonwealth Endangered Species Protection Act 1992 and Schedule 2 of the NSW Threatened Species Act 1995 and under Schedule 3 Part 3 of the QLD Nature Conservation Act 1992 G. Kennedyana is currently listed as ‘vulnerable’.Queensland Government. (2013). Nature Conservation Act 1992: Nature Conservation (wildlife) Regulation 2006. Available from https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/CURRENT/N/NatureConWiR06.pdf This means that the plant is not currently endangered but will be at risk in the next 20–50 years, but it is considered ‘adequately conserved’ as majority of the population resides in a national park.Briggs, J. D. and Leigh, J. H. (1995). Rare or threatened Australian plants (Revised Edition). Canberra: CSIRO.  Threatening processes  The processes and events that have caused the rarity of G. Kenneydana are not known, but it has been hypothesised in the Recovery Plan, issued by the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Services, that minor habitat degradation by browsing herbivores and the absence of pre- European fire regimes may have negatively impacted G. kennedyana. Seed predation has also been suggested in later studies. = Fire = Before European settlement in Australia, Indigenous Australians managed the land using fire. Once Europeans colonised the area these fire practices began to decline and the effect it has had on the plant is unknown. While fire is not required for G. kennedyana to release its seed, it is believed that it is required for breaking seed dormancy. This needs to be properly investigated as the species does not occur in a fire prone zone. = Grazing = It is possible that G. kennedyana is able to withstand browsing pressures, as it has been subjected to intensive and prolonged grazing by stock from the 1890s to the mid 20th century. Rabbits and other native macropods are also likely to browse the plant. These actions from herbivores are believed to have caused an observed lack of seedling recruitment. = Seed predation = It is possible that insects, mammals and birds could be eating the seeds. Other species of Grevillea have been effected by seed predation. This is a possible contributing factor to the lack of recruitment of the species.  Species ability to recover  The current known populations of G. kennedyana appear to be quite stable for the last six years that it has been monitored in the field. At present there is no known evidence to suggest that the species is significantly declining or being threatened. Also because of the species ability to persist given the heavy grazing that occurred in the park, the wild populations of the plant looks likely to remain for at least another 50–100 years. The lack of recruitment is a concern for the survival of the plant in the long-term. A possible reason for its rarity is most likely the result of natural evolutionary and ecological processes.  Recovery plan  As majority of the populations of G. Kennedyana reside in the Sturt National Park in NSW, the National Parks and Wildlife Service have created a recovery plan for the species. The three main objectives are to protect and monitor all known populations; find and manage the threats that are effecting the survival and recruitment of the species; and involve the community in the conservation of the species by working with the relevant landholders and managers to improve the management of identified threats to the plant.  Uses  Most Grevillea species contain a honey-like liquid that is edible to humans. G. kennedyana contains a large amount of a clear, sweet liquid, which can be shaken from the flowers. However, due to the large volume of liquid it makes the flower difficult to preserve.Maiden, J. H. (1975). The useful native plants of Australia (Facsi mile Edition). Melbourne: Compendium.

The species is endemic to southern South America. Etymology The specific name, munoai, is in honor of Uruguayan zoologist Juan Ignacio Muñoa (1925–1960).Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Amphisbaena munoai, p. 185). Habitat and behavior A. munoai can be found hiding under stones or decomposing bark. Hiding under stones allows the amphisbaenian to raise its body temperature without exposing itself to predators. Diet The main component of the diet of A. munoai consists of termites, but it also consumes various types of small insect larva. Reproduction A. munoai has a seasonal reproductive cycle. Females are able to be fertilized between June and October while males display a high testicle volume during this period. Females carry eggs from November to December and thus it is believed that copulation occurs from September to November. The eggs of A. munoai are frequently found in ant nests. Sexually mature males have a significantly smaller snout-vent length than sexually mature females. Geographic range A. munoai can be found in the pampas biome of southern Brazil, a temperate climate, and in Uruguay. References Further reading *Klappenbach, Miguel A.

Location The community lies in an area called The Flats, on a spur of Chilhowee Mountain in East Tennessee. The surrounding country is rugged. The Foothills Parkway passes just to the northwest, and the boundary of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park lies just to the southeast. The neighboring park has a natural forest environment of yellow pines and hardwood species. Controlled burns are used to reduce the risk of uncontrolled fires. There is a healthy black bear population. The community is relatively isolated. The Foothills Parkway is the only road to Top of the World that is passable by school bus. Otherwise it must be accessed by steep and winding secondary roads. History The land was originally the home of the Cherokee Nation, who were mostly displaced to Oklahoma along the Trail of Tears in 1838. A grant of was made to Daniel D. Foute in 1837. This included the area now covered by Top of the World, which was purchased by a developer in the early 1960s. Construction of the Top of World Estates by Roy and Charles Headrick was reported by the Knoxville News Sentinel in June 1965. The community surrounds Lake in the Sky, a artificial lake formed by a dam built in 1966. Community Residents may belong to the Top of the World Landowners' Association (TOWLA). The Blount County Fire Protection District has its station #8 at 5714 Flats Road, on the east shore of the lake. The fire station officially came into service when the TOWLA and the Blount County Fire Protection District signed a contract on 23 March 2012. There is no local school.

Rational analysis starts from the assumption that the mind is adapted to its environment. Rational analysis uses this assumption to investigate the structure and purpose of representations and cognitive processes by studying the structure of the environment. The methodology of rational analysis comprises six steps: #Goals: Specify precisely the goals of the cognitive system. #Environment: Develop a formal model of the environment to which the system is adapted. #Computational Limitations: Make the minimal assumptions about computational limitations. #Optimization: Derive the optimal behavioral function given 1-3 above. #Data: Examine the empirical literature to see whether the predictions of the behavioral function are confirmed. #Iteration: Repeat, iteratively refining the theory Rational analysis has been applied to memory, categorization, causal inference, problem solving, and reasoning.

History In a 2000 Hong Kong governmental study, two separate rail links were proposed as the Deep Bay Link and the Chek Lap Kok Link. It was envisaged that the Deep Bay Link could connect the Nanshan District of Shenzhen with the new developing areas in Hung Shui Kiu, possibly interchanging with the MTR West Rail Line. The Chek Lap Kok Link would connect HKIA and Lantau Island with Tuen Mun. However it was determined that the projects were not warranted at the development levels of the served areas at that time. A further study put forward a proposed Airport Rail Link to connect Hong Kong International Airport and Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport. This would be in addition to the current fast ferry service between the two airports, allowing seamless transfers between domestic Chinese flights from Shenzhen and international flight from Hong Kong, allowing travellers to bypass Hong Kong Immigration. In another 2011 Hong Kong governmental rail study, the above projects were combined and renamed the Hong Kong–Shenzhen Western Express Railway. In the decade since the original study, the residential development areas in the North Western New Territories had outpaced the infrastructure developments in that region. Also the two existing and third under construction cross border rail lines all went to the eastern districts of Futian and Luohu, Shenzhen. With major new Shenzhen developments occurring in the western Nanshan district, especially the new Qianhai CBD area, it was deemed that a western rail crossing was feasible. It would also utilise the new Hong Kong Cross Border Facility (HKBCF) being built on reclaimed land near the airport, built to service the Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge. Air rail intermodal service The aviation network covered by the two airports can be complementary, where the HKIA operates flights to around 120 overseas destinations and the SZIA has flights to around 110 domestic destinations. Through a fast rail connection between the two airports, it would create opportunities for the airline companies on both sides to jointly provide air-transit service between international and mainland cities. Air passengers arriving at the HKIA by international flights from overseas cities could then take the railway to the SZIA and transfer to a connecting domestic flight to destinations on the mainland, including second-tier and third-tier mainland cities, and vice versa. Due to the proximity of the two airports, the railway journey time would only take around twenty or so minutes and shorten the minimum connection time (MCT) between the flights. The target is to make the MCT comparable with those between international and domestic flights at other major airports on the Mainland. As the HKIA has certain competitive advantages in terms of the number of international destinations and flight frequencies, second-tier and third-tier mainland cities lacking in direct international air services would find the air-transit service at the HKIA and SZIA more convenient than that of other mainland airports, making the airports of Hong Kong and Shenzhen more competitive. In addition, the provision of cross-boundary land-to-air services (i.e. travelling from the urban area of Shenzhen to the HKIA, or from the urban area of Hong Kong to the SZIA) can facilitate Hong Kong passengers to reach second-tier and third-tier mainland cities through the SZIA, and attract residents in Shenzhen and the eastern coast of the Pearl River Delta to travel to overseas destinations through the HKIA, thereby expanding the market catchment of the two airports. Cross-boundary spur line service Since its commissioning in 2007, the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Corridor has been the only cross-boundary land route connecting to western Shenzhen. Its patronage has increased on average by 26% per annum from 2008 to 2011, and is much higher than the 6% average annual growth for the overall land-based cross- boundary trips in the 2000s. This reflects a strong public demand for cross- boundary transport services to the western Shenzhen. Meanwhile, Qianhai is the key development area in the western Shenzhen and has been targeted to develop as a production service centre and a Hong Kong-Shenzhen modern service industries co-operation exemplary zone. It is expected to stimulate extensive economic activities and generate new cross-boundary transport demand. Furthermore, Qianhai will become a transport hub of the Shenzhen metro-lines (including the Shenzhen Metro No. 1, 5 and 11 Lines), and the future extension of the Guangzhou-Dongguan-Shenzhen Intercity Railway to this area, allowing passengers to travel conveniently to and from ten or so major towns on the eastern coast of the PRD. By comparison, there are over 100 existing operators at present providing cross-boundary coach services via the Shenzhen Bay Port. There are also franchised buses and minibuses running from Tuen Mun, Tin Shui Wai and Yuen Long to the Shenzhen Bay Port, largely performing the same function of the proposed Cross-boundary Spur Line. Therefore, the implementation programme for the Cross-boundary Spur Line Service will depend on the growth of the cross-boundary movements, planning parameters and actual implementation progress of the Hung Shui Kiu and Qianhai developments. Domestic spur line service The idea of the Domestic Spur Line Service is to conveniently serve the daily transport demand of the residents in Tuen Mun and Yuen Long travelling to the HKIA and northern Lantau, or interchanging with the Tung Chung Line to travel to and from Kowloon and Hong Kong Island. Subject to the planning conditions, the Domestic Spur Line can also serve Siu Ho Wan if development takes place in that region. Furthermore, the Domestic Spur Line Service could connect the Hong Kong Border Crossing Facility(HKBCF) to the local railway network, allowing cross-boundary passengers to travel to the North West New Territories(NWNT) via the West Rail Line or urban area via the Tung Chung Line to connect with the Hong Kong–Zhuai–Macau Bridge. On the other hand, the proposed Tuen Mun–Chek Lap Kok Link (TMCLKL) will connect the NWNT, HKBCF and northern Lantau and become an alternative land route to the northern Lantau and HKIA. This road link will support both passenger and cargo transportation services, and reduce the risk of completely relying on the Lantau Link as the sole corridor to the HKIA; however, the proposed TMCLKL would partly overlap with the route of the Domestic Spur Line.

It will replace the original 2 World Trade Center, which was completed in 1972 and subsequently destroyed during the September 11 attacks in 2001, and it will occupy the position of the original 5 World Trade Center. The foundation work was completed in 2013.

The South Tower's rooftop observation deck was high and its indoor observation deck was high. The World Trade Center towers held the height record only briefly; the Willis Tower in Chicago, finished in , reached at the rooftop. Throughout its existence, however, the South Tower had more floors (at 110) than any other building. This number was not surpassed until the advent of the Burj Khalifa, which opened in 2010. Of the 110 stories, eight were set aside for technical services in mechanical floors (floors 7/8, 41/42, 75/76, and 108/109), which were four two-floor areas that evenly spaced up the building. All the remaining floors were free for open-plan offices. Each floor of the towers had of space for occupancy. The original Two World Trade Center had 95 express and local elevators.Ruchelman (1977), p. 11 The tower had of office space.The World Trade Center — Facts and Figures . Nysm.nysed.gov (February 26, 1993). Retrieved on 2014-06-23. Initially conceived as a complex dedicated to companies and organizations directly taking part in \\"world trade\\", the South Tower, along with 1 World Trade Center (also known as the North Tower) at first failed to attract the expected clientele. During the early years, various governmental organizations became key tenants of the World Trade Center towers including the State of New York. It was not until the 1980s that the city's perilous financial state eased, after which an increasing number of private companies – mostly financial firms tied to Wall Street — became tenants. During the 1990s, approximately 500 companies had offices in the complex including many financial companies such as Morgan Stanley, Aon Corporation, Salomon Brothers, and the Port Authority itself. The basement concourse of the World Trade Center included The Mall at the World Trade Center, along with a PATH station. Electrical service to the towers was supplied by Consolidated Edison (ConEd) at 13,800 volts. This service passed through the World Trade Center Primary Distribution Center (PDC) and sent up through the core of the building to electrical substations located on the mechanical floors. The substations stepped down the 13,800 primary voltage to 480/277 volt secondary service, and then further down to 208/120 volt general power and lighting service. The complex also was served by emergency generators located in the sub-levels of the towers and on the roof of 5 WTC. The 110th floor of 1 World Trade Center (the North Tower) housed radio and television transmission equipment; access to the roof of 1 WTC was controlled from the WTC Operations Control Center (OCC) located in the B1 level of 2 WTC. United Airlines Flight 175 hits 2 WTC on September 11, 2001 At 9:03 a.m. EDT on September 11, 2001, five terrorists crashed United Airlines Flight 175 into the southern facade of the South Tower. Three buildings in the World Trade Center complex, including 2 WTC, collapsed due to fire-induced structural failure. The light construction and hollow nature of the structures allowed the jet fuel to penetrate far inside the towers, igniting many large fires simultaneously over a wide area of the impacted floors. The fuel from the planes burned at most for a few minutes, but the contents of the buildings burned over the next hour to hour and a half. The fires might not have been as centrally positioned, nor as intense, had traditionally heavy high-rise construction been standing in the way of the aircraft. Debris and fuel would likely have remained mostly outside the buildings or concentrated in more peripheral areas away from the building cores, which would then not have become unique failure points. In this scenario, the towers might have stood far longer, perhaps indefinitely. The fires were hot enough to weaken the columns and cause floors to sag, pulling perimeter columns inward and reducing their ability to support the mass of the building above. The South Tower collapsed at 9:59 a.m. after burning for 56 minutes in the fire caused by the impact of United Airlines Flight 175 and the explosion of its fuel. New building The new 82-story building, if erected, will have a total height of . In comparison, the Empire State Building's roof at the 102nd floor is tall, with its antenna, and the original 2 World Trade Center (referred to as the South Tower) was . Designs The tower was originally designed by Foster and Partners in 2006, then redesigned by the Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG), before finally being given back to Foster and Partners for a redesign of the original concept in 2020. =Foster and Partners= In Foster and Partners' original design, the structural engineer for the building was WSP Cantor Seinuk.\\"Ground Zero Office Designs Hailed as Hopeful Symbols\\" in Engineering News-Record, September 18, 2006, pg. 12 In the original plan, the building's sloping roof consisted of four diamonds inclined toward the memorial that would have provided a visual marker around the skyline of just where the original towers were. The tower was designed to resemble a diamond, with cross bracing intersects and indentations breaking up the sides.Skyscrapernews New World Trade Center Designs Released, URL retrieved September 11, 2006 The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said the following about 200 Greenwich Street's wedged rooftop: \\"Designed by Lord Foster, the tower incorporates WTC master planner Daniel Libeskind's 'wedge of light' concept, and will cast no shadow on the memorial park on September 11.\\" The total floor space of 200 Greenwich Street was anticipated to include of office space and another for retail shops and access areas to the underground World Trade Center PATH station. =Bjarke Ingels Group= BIG's Proposed Design (2015) On June 9, 2015, Wired magazine reported that Two World Trade Center would be newly redesigned by Bjarke Ingels of Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG), and be built by 2020. The bottom half of the new design would have been leased out to 21st Century Fox and News Corp until they decided against leaving their current headquarters. Bjarke Ingels Group began redesigning 2 World Trade Center in December 2014, upon the requests of the property's developer Silverstein Properties and its possible future media tenants. The project's redesign was warranted since financial firms had since migrated away from the Financial District, making leasing out the new buildings a struggle and further prolonging the World Trade Center's redevelopment. Financial firms were the intended occupants for Foster and Partners' 2 World Trade Center, and the original proposal's sky lobby design was not attractive to media tenants, who have been the leading tenants of the new WTC towers and were expected to occupy BIG's redesigned building. This design featured a cantilevering structure viewed from a northern perspective, but a terraced structure from an eastern perspective. From the south and west, the building's profile was vertically straight, but appeared to be leaning slightly toward One World Trade Center because of the cantilevering design. In an interview, Bjarke Ingels described the concept of the redesign as such: \\"Two World Trade is almost like a vertical village of bespoke buildings within the building, that also can be seen as a single tower. It actually has an inclination towards One World Trade Center, so the two towers – even though they're not twinning – by having a mutual relationship, the space between them is parallel, although at an incline.\\" The tower had also been described to integrate Tribeca with the Financial District, as the design's cantilevers and terraces resembled the modern architecture known of the neighborhood. The first three floors of the office building, including the ground level, would have featured about of retail space. The tower would have been the second–tallest skyscraper on the World Trade Center site, following One World Trade Center. = Return to Foster and Partners = After the pulling out of News Corp and 21st Century Fox, the future of the site became uncertain, with calls for the tower's design to be reverted to its original incarnation. In a press interview, site developer Larry Silverstein signaled that both the Foster and BIG site plans were under consideration, and that a choice between the two would be made by a future prospective tenant. In February 2019, Silverstein suggested in an interview that construction may soon begin \\"on spec\\", or without an anchor tenant, given the strong economy and leasing progress made on neighboring towers.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-11/silverstein-eyes- building-final-wtc-tower-without-signed-tenant In January 2020, Silverstein announced that he and Norman Foster were working together to update Foster's original design, and that it would be \\"significantly modified to be more reflective of contemporary needs and taste\\". Construction Excavation for 200 Greenwich Street commenced in 2008http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/11/late-delivery-of-the-2-world- trade-center-site/ and the building was originally scheduled to be completed sometime between 2011 and 2016. On May 11, 2009, however, it was announced that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was seeking to reduce the tower to a \\"stump\\" building of approximately ten stories. The overall plan, which also calls for a similar reduction in height for 3 World Trade Center and the cancellation of 5 World Trade Center, would halve the amount of office space available in the fully reconstructed World Trade Center to 5 million square feet (465,000 square meters). The agency cited the recession and disagreements with developer Larry Silverstein as reasons for the proposed reduction. The plan has seen some opposition; a May 2009 piece in the New York Post challenged the necessity of the office space reduction, given Lower Manhattan's low commercial vacancy rate compared to other U.S. cities and overall demand for modern office properties. Silverstein is opposed to the plan, and filed a notice of dispute on July 7, 2009. By doing so, the development firm began a two-week period during which renegotiated settlements and a binding arbitration regarding the construction of the four World Trade Center towers can be made. Silverstein Properties, which has paid the Port Authority over $2.75 billion in financing, noted the organization's inability to meet construction obligations in its official complaint. The development firm has proposed further government intervention in the project as a way of settling the dispute. On December 2, 2009, a US$2.6 billion tax-free bond issue for the building's construction was approved by the state of New York to continue construction on the World Trade Center site. The construction of Two World Trade Center, however, remained on-hold. On March 25, 2010, the Port Authority released plans to build Two and Three World Trade Center to street level. The transit and retail podium at the 175 Greenwich Street site would be constructed immediately, but the construction of Tower 3 would be delayed until Silverstein Properties obtains financing for the remaining cost of the tower. Tower 3 will be built, but Tower 2's office construction will wait until the economy improves. Tower 2 foundation work began on June 1, 2010, but construction was halted in August 2012.Construction Update: Two World Trade Center Still Stalled. New York Yimby. Retrieved on June 23, 2014.

Retrieved on 2014-06-23. and construction of everything up to street level was completed in mid-2013. The rest of the building, however, has yet to be built unless tenants for Tower 2 can be found. On February 11, 2019, Larry Silverstein said in an interview that he was considering building the tower without a signed tenant. He stated, \\"For all intents and purposes, it wouldn't be a bad idea to start on Tower 2 because it won't be finished until about 2022, 2023.\\" Possible tenants Unfinished construction site In 2013, Citigroup had shortlisted the tower as one of three potential locations for its headquarters for when its lease on 399 Park Avenue expired in 2017. The company eventually chose nearby 388 Greenwich Street, however: a building that it already had under lease. Silverstein has faced considerable difficulty in persuading tenants to lease floorspace in Two World Trade Center. Most commonly, businesses ultimately decide against doing so because of the costs of moving in, but others prefer their current locations in Midtown Manhattan despite the leases sometimes being more costly, since Midtown Manhattan offers easier access to the Upper East Side, North Jersey, Long Island, Westchester, and Connecticut. Silverstein has tried to appeal to the Downtown's proximity to nearby Brooklyn, the residence of many technology and media companies' employees. At present, prospective companies either are too large to be housed adequately in 2 World Trade Center (such as Facebook or Google), or conclude it would save money to remain where they are (such as News Corp and Fox Corporation). Bloomberg Business reported on June 2, 2015, that News Corp and 21st Century Fox, both owned by Rupert Murdoch, had signed a non-binding agreement with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to create a joint headquarters at Two World Trade Center. Silverstein said, \\"A decision by 21st Century Fox and News Corp. to move to the new World Trade Center would cap a seismic shift that has taken place in Lower Manhattan over the past decade. This isn't your grandfather's Wall Street.\\" The change of lead architects, from Norman Foster to Bjarke Ingels, was dependent on the Murdoch companies' relocations to the site; a redesign was deemed necessary given the different requirements for TV studios as opposed to financial companies, the assumed major tenants for the Foster design. Ingels's design would be kept at the same height as Foster's, but it was unclear how the redesign would conflict with the below-grade work already completed, which conformed to the original building design. On January 15, 2016, it was reported that the two companies had decided against moving into 2 World Trade Center, instead keeping their current headquarters on the Avenue of the Americas. They had concluded that \\"given the scale of investment in a relocation of this size, that our resources would be better directed elsewhere.\\" In September 2017, Deutsche Bank was considering relocating their U.S. headquarters to 2 WTC, signing on as anchor tenant once their lease expires at their current location along nearby 60 Wall Street.

It contains a single species, Europelta carbonensis. It is known from two associated partial skeletons, and represents the most complete ankylosaur known from Europe. Discovery Skeletal reconstruction Europelta was first described and named by James Ian Kirkland, Luis Alcalá, Mark A. Loewen, Eduardo Espílez, Luis Mampel and Jelle P. Wiersma in 2013 and the type species is Europelta carbonensis. The generic name combines a contraction for Europe, as it is the most complete ankylosaur from the continent, and πέλτα (pelta) Ancient Greek for \\"shield\\", a common suffix for ankylosaurian genus names in reference to their armored bodies. The specific name means \\"from the coal\\", from the Latin carbo, in honor of the access provided by the Sociedad Anónima Minera Catalano-Aragonesa (SAMCA Group) to the fossil locality where Europelta was found, in the open-pit Santa María coal mine. Europelta is known from two associated partial skeletons, reposited at Fundación Conjunto Paleontológico de Teruel-Dinópolis/Museo Aragonés de Paleontología (FCPTD/MAP). Discovered in 2011, the remains came from Fundación Conjunto Paleontológico of Teruel-Dinópolis locality AR-1, located east of Ariño, in the northern Teruel Province in the Community of Aragón. This vertebrate site occurs below the lowest mineable coal seam operated by SAMCA Group's Ariño coal mine in a plant debris bed in the lower Escucha Formation, and the most abundant dinosaur identified from it is the iguanodontian Proa valdearinnoensis. The paratype of Europelta was collected 200 meters laterally from the holotype in the same bed. The site dates to the early Albian stage of the late Early Cretaceous, based on an analysis of the palynomorphs, ostracods and charophytes (nanofossils). Holotype skull The holotype, AR-1/10, represents a disarticulated partial skeleton spread over an area of seven by three meters. It consists of a nearly complete skull, isolated left and right nasals, a dentary fragment, 15 isolated teeth, an atlas, five cervical vertebrae, two cervical ribs, possibly the first and seven more posterior dorsal vertebrae, a section of synsacrum, three isolated dorsal ribs, seven dorsal rib fragments, three caudal vertebrae, four chevrons, a coracoid with a small portion of the scapula, a scapular blade fragment, two xiphosternal plates, both partial humeri, right articulated ilium, ischium and pubis, left articulated ischium and pubis, and 70 osteoderms. The second partial skeleton AR-1/31, designed as the paratype, consists of a partial left jaw with dentary and surangular and isolated angular, ten teeth, five cervical, nine dorsal, three or four dorsosacral, one caudosacral and 14 caudal vertebrae, a sacrum, two sacral rib fragments, both ischia with fused pubes, two left ilium fragments, complete right ilium, femur, tibia and fibula, a calcaneum, four metatarsals, eight phalanges, nine unguals, and 90 osteoderms. Description Size and distinguishing traits Restoration of the skull Europelta is a medium-sized nodosaurid, approximately four and a half meters in length.Matthew Piper, \\"Utah paleos: Euro dinosaur find hints at continental history\\", The Salt Lake Tribune, 2 December 2013 Europelta is distinguished from other ankylosaurs by the following diagnostic traits: Its quadrate bone is shorter and mediolaterally wider than in any other ankylosaur. The rear margin of the skull is concave in dorsal view. In lateral view, the sacrum of Europelta is arched dorsally, describing an arc of about 55°. The pubis is fully fused to the ischium forming an ischiopubis, but creating a unique slot-shaped foramen between the post-pubic process and the position of the pubic peduncle. The ratio of lengths of tibia to femur (0.9) is greater than in any other ankylosaur for which these proportions are known. Europelta also possesses autapomorphic osteoderms located anteriorly on the outer corners of the pelvic shield, that are flanged with the keel laterally compressed, and with a flat plate-like base. Skeleton Size comparison of Europelta and a human. The skull is pear-shaped in top view, with a length of 370.3 millimetres and a width, over the eye sockets, of 299.1 millimetres. The external nostril seems to be simple in build, without any sign of complex air passages. Likewise a secondary palate seems to be missing. The palate is only lightly constricted in top view and the typical ankylosaurian hourglass profile is largely lacking. The same is true for the curvature of the tooth rows in the maxillae. There are twenty- two to twenty-five maxillary teeth per side. The last six teeth in the rear are conspicuously larger than the front teeth. The skull roof is largely covered by a large single osteoderm on the frontal and parietal bones. The describing authors interpreted such osteoderms as ossified horn scales. On the rear corners of the skull squamosal horns are present. The large cheek horn is formed by the quadratojugal instead of the jugal bone. Phylogeny Illustration Europelta was by its describers placed in the Nodosauridae, forming a smaller clade Struthiosaurinae together with the European nodosaurids Anoplosaurus, Hungarosaurus and Struthiosaurus. Europelta was by the authors considered to be the oldest known nodosaurid from Europe. They pointed out that its appearance, as a nodosaurid successor of Polacanthidae, paralleled a comparable co-eval succession of polacanthids by nodosaurids in North-America. They suggested that this was not a coincidence but an indication that the faunae of North-America and Europe had not yet been separated by the developing northern Atlantic Ocean, as had been presumed earlier.

They set up an ambush for Lloyd, but the three others ditch Logan and go for the gold, only to find it snatched by the Mexican Camiseros gang. They ally with Lloyd against the Camiseros and then blow up Lloyd and his men, only to be intercepted by a Union troop led by Logan, who is a Union spy. The heroes manage to exterminate the Union men but are stopped by a Confederate troop led by General Sibley, who had suspected Logan but needed proof. The three are given horses and warned not to show themselves in these parts. When Sibley later hands over the gold to the Mexican army in exchange for weapons the three companions, now dressed in ponchos, suddenly drive off with the wagon, pursued by the Mexicans.

Operations  Veidekke Industry is Norway's largest private operator in the asphalt market. The company produced 1,9 million tons of asphalt in 2012, out of a total production volume in Norway of approximately 5,3 million tons. The company is also one of the largest producers of gravel and crushed stone, as well as being maintenance operators of public roads. Veidekke Industry is one of a few companies with worldwide expertise in asphalt core construction. The advantage of Asphaltic Concrete Cores for Embankment dams, is its cost effective waterproofing capabilities and its reliability in various climatic conditions. In 1995, Veidekke Industry and Shell joined forces to work on a difficult challenge: The development of a process for making asphalt at lower temperatures without sacrificing the quality of the product. Five years later the venture reached its goal with the WAM Foam process, Warm Asphalt Mix, based on Veidekke Industry’s foam bitumen technology.  History  Veidekke Industry was formed in 1999, but its history goes back to 1910 when AS Sigurd Hesselberg began making asphalt concrete and later became Norway's first maker of asphalt for roads. When Sigurd Hesselberg died in 1929, Bjarne L. Corwin makes the company become Norway's largest private asphalt entrepreneur. In 1964 Bjarne L Corwin's son, Paul Corwin becomes the company's new leader and by then AS Sigurd Hesselberg is the dominant company in the Norwegian asphalt industry. In 1950, Arne W. Korsbrekke and Fritz Lorck, both former employees of Bjarne L Corwin, founded Korsbrekke og Lorck AS (KOLO). The company is well equipped and gets contracts for Ørlandet and Andøya airport. The company runs its business independently, but in close relations with AS Veidekke from the start of the 1960s. In 1988 AS Sigurd Hesselberg, sells its main division Hesselberg Vei to AS Veidekke. By now, Korsbrekke og Lorck is partially owned by AS Veidekke. A new company is formed, Veidekke Asfalt. Together with Korsbrekke og Lorck AS, Veidekke Asfalt now has the hegemony in the industry.

Pre-disaster The Columbia was built at Clinton, Iowa in 1897. Originally a packet boat, it was converted to an excursion boat in 1905. In 1912, a well-respected captain, Herman F. Mehl of Peoria, formed the Herman F. Mehl Excursion Company, and bought the Columbia from Captain Walter Blair of Davenport, Iowa In autumn 1917, the ship was rebuilt at the Howard Ship Company's Mound City yards, in time for the 1918 excursion season. Transcribed by Desiree Burrell Rodcay. (Warning: Site uses ad popups.) Mehl spent almost $18,000 on renovations to meet safety standards, after which the federal inspectors called the Columbia \\"the safest boat on western waters\\". Last voyage The Columbia excursion of July 4, 1918 was hosted by Pekin's South Side Social Club. The club sold 563 tickets Transcribed by Desiree Burrell Rodcay. at the price of 50 cents, or 25 cents for children. One hundred of the passengers were picked up at Kingston Mines, the boat leaving at 7:30 p.m.; the rest were picked up in Pekin. The boat left Pekin at 8:15 p.m. The Columbia docked at Al Fresco Park along the river in Richwoods Township (and now Peoria Heights) for 30 minutes, then returned downstream. Just after passing under the Peoria and Pekin Union Railway bridge, just upstream from Wesley City (now Creve Coeur), the boat encountered dense fog, which a passenger described as \\"like going from sunshine into darkness\\". Transcribed by Desiree Burrell Rodcay. The pilot lost control of the vessel, which then drifted towards the Peoria County, Illinois side of the river. Captain Mehl told pilot Tom Williams to make for the shore, unaware of a large hole torn in the ship's side by a submerged log. Williams attempted to cross from the overgrown Peoria County side to the Tazewell County side, where there were populated shacks and a possible landing. However, the ship's decks quickly collapsed on top of each other. Aftermath The same inspectors who had declared the boat safe were the ones who conducted the federal investigation. Mehl and Williams both lost their licenses. The coroner implicated Mehl, Williams, and the purser of the Columbia, but the case never went to trial. After the disaster, the boat remained partially submerged for some time. The disaster ended the bulk of the riverboat excursion business on the Illinois River.

He was a staff photographer with The Dallas Morning News from 1949 to 1986. He was particularly known for his images of animals and children. Grant's photographs were published in numerous newspapers and magazines, including Paris Match, Newsweek and Time; five of his feature photos were published on the back page of issues of Life magazine. Grant was on assignment in November 1963 to cover President John F. Kennedy's trip from Washington, D.C., to Dallas. One of his photographs made the front page of the November 22 edition of the Morning News; a copy is believed to be the last thing Kennedy ever signed. Grant also would make several pictures at Parkland Memorial Hospital within minutes after Kennedy's motorcade arrived following the shooting in Dealey Plaza. Grant was the recipient of multiple photojournalism awards during his career, including the Medallion for Excellence in Photojournalism. He retired from The Dallas Morning News in 1986, but continued working in a semi-retired capacity for more than a decade thereafter. He died in Dallas of heart failure at age 93. Early life Clint Grant was born in Nashville, Tennessee. During his time at Vanderbilt University, economic troubles brought on by the Great Depression forced Grant's family to move from Nashville; they settled in Dallas, Texas, where his father was asked to lead the Art Department at the Morning News. Grant got a job with the Photo Department, but he was drafted into the United States Army before he could report to work. Grant served during World War II in Europe, where he never used a camera. Grant married Myrtis Ann Halliburton in 1939 after a brief courtship; they had known each other for ten months before they walked down the aisle. When they met, he worked behind the dairy counter at the local A&P; market where she was a customer. Photography and photojournalism When Grant returned from overseas to Dallas in 1945, all Morning News staff photographers resumed their duties, leaving him without a job. He ran a photography studio until 1949, when a position at the newspaper became available. His editor said Clint Grant \\"was great with children and animals, which took absolute patience.\\" This photograph was part of a collection donated by Grant to the Dallas Public Library. During his early years with the News, Grant was one of a group of staff photographers that included Jack Beers, Tom Dillard, Doris Jacoby and Joe Laird. He gained a reputation for generosity as a mentor while with the newspaper, accompanying many young photographers on their early assignments; one of them later recalled that whenever the Morning News needed a feature photograph, they would send \\"the trusty Clint Grant\\" to the zoo to work with an animal. His evocative photographs often featured animals and children, and his editor said Grant's knack for putting subjects at ease came largely because he \\"had the patience of Job.\\" Grant's work also accompanied sports stories. A photograph of a boxing fan and a fallen fighter was named one of the best sports pictures of 1956. Grant taught classes in photography in the 1950s and '60s at North Texas University, where he served on the journalism advisory board. He was also the official photographer for the Dallas Zoo and the State Fair of Texas. In an interview, Grant said he had his own tricks for making photos, especially of unwilling subjects at the sites of news stories. He would pre- focus, pretend to not aim the camera, and \\"shoot from the hip.\\" He believed that any good photojournalist should have the skills necessary to do the job without needing to use the viewfinder. One of Grant's photos was blown up to eight feet and displayed for one year in Grand Central Terminal in New York City. He also photographed the culinary creations of some of the top chefs in Dallas, who all knew Grant and respected his work. A menu item at the Casa Dominguez restaurant in Dallas was named for Grant. Two collections of Grant's work have been published: Moments from Life: An Exhibition of Photographs from the Grant Estate in 2000, and 50 Years of the Best Photos of Clint Grant in 2001. Moments from Life was published to accompany a traveling exhibit of 55 of Grant's images. One of his photographs was included in Humor in News Photography, a collection published in 1961. Grant was assigned to photograph some new cars and laid his hat atop one of the taillights; the resulting image resembled \\"a Halloween spook, a Martian or the pilot of a satellite.\\" A Grant picture published by Life magazine was included in its 1988 compilation Life Smiles Back. In addition to his feature photographs, Grant was known for his work accompanying hard news stories. Grant photographed every U.S. president and vice president starting with Harry S. Truman and through the administration of George H. W. Bush. He was present for the 1961 funeral for three-time House Speaker Sam Rayburn, where he captured former Presidents Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower, President Kennedy, House Parliamentarian Clarence Cannon, and Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson standing together. John F. Kennedy =Dallas, 1960= John F. Kennedy and his running mate, Lyndon B. Johnson, were close to securing their spots on the Democrats' ticket when they took a two-day swing through the Dallas–Fort Worth area in September 1960. Landing at Meacham Airport, the candidates rode in a motorcade through Dallas to the Chance Vought Aircraft factory, where Kennedy made an address. Grant accompanied Kennedy and Johnson, making numerous photographs of the trip; the pictures were developed, but kept in storage until their publication in 2013. =Dallas, 1963= Image made by Grant in Dealey Plaza following the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Bill and Gayle Newman cover their children on the lawn. Grant's brother-in law, Associated Press photojournalist Ike Altgens, stands at the curb to photo-right. Several days before President Kennedy made his November flight to Texas, Grant had been assigned to cover the state's delegation in Washington, D.C., then fly back with the White House press corps; he was the only photographer to make the trip. At Dallas Love Field, Grant made the only published photograph from that visit of the president and Jacqueline Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Lady Bird Johnson, and Texas Governor John Connally and Nellie Connally, all in the same image. Another of Grant's photos, from San Antonio's Aerospace Medicine Center, was published on the front page of the Dallas Morning News on November 22;Photo credit, \\"–Dallas News Staff Photo by Clint Grant.\\" Dallas Morning News. November 22, 1963. p. 1. a copy was signed that morning by President Kennedy—across the photo, to Jan White—and is believed to be the last item he signed before he climbed aboard the presidential limousine for his intended trip to the Dallas Trade Mart. Grant tried to find a seat in the third camera car in the motorcade—the one reserved for local photographers—but it was full; he was then given a spot in the second camera car. Too far back to capture the shooting in Dealey Plaza, Grant's car had just turned onto Houston Street from Main Street \\"when we heard one shot—pause—two shots in rapid succession.\\" Thinking someone was playing a prank, he gave it no further thought until he saw bystanders on the ground along Elm Street, where he made a photograph from the moving camera car of Bill and Gayle Newman lying atop their children on the grass. Afterward, Grant suggested to his colleagues that they should catch up with the presidential limousine. Since he was the only Dallas-based member of the press in camera car two, Grant directed his driver to the Trade Mart, where they saw no activity. A worker across the street said he saw a limousine speed past, accompanied by motorcycles with their sirens blaring; Grant knew immediately that they were headed to Parkland Memorial Hospital. Once at Parkland, Grant started snapping pictures of anything he could, including Vice President Johnson's car, and a man and a police officer delivering what Grant believed was blood plasma. Grant later covered the trial of Jack Ruby. On the day the verdict was read, he believed his assignment was to photograph the jurors, but they were shielded from his view. Twenty-five years after the assassination, Grant wrote that the events did not really sink in until after he had finished his work that day. \\"Then I was stunned, disappointed and embarrassed that it had happened—especially in my home town. I felt like crawling under a log. Although I wasn't a great admirer, he was my President and I have great respect for whoever holds the office.\\" =Reporters' panel, 1993= Grant took part in \\"Reporters Remember 11-22-63\\" at Southern Methodist University in Dallas in November 1993. The panel discussion, broadcast on C-SPAN as Journalists Remember the JFK Assassination, featured members of the press who spoke of their experiences on the day 30 years earlier that Kennedy was killed. From the dais, Grant offered his memories of the motorcade, and recalled asking his boss afterward if he should go back to Washington, D.C., with Kennedy's body and being told no. Grant said he returned to Love Field to retrieve his luggage ahead of a planned visit to Vice President Johnson's ranch nearby; just as he reached the planes he saw Judge Sarah T. Hughes leaving Air Force One. \\"I'd just missed her swearing in the new president.\\" Later life and death Grant retired his position with The Dallas Morning News in 1986; he stayed on in a semi-retired capacity until 1997. Five years later, Grant was awarded an honorary degree from Knox College in Illinois, which congratulated Grant for more than 100 photojournalism honors at the state, regional and national levels, including the Medallion for Excellence in Photojournalism from the Southwest Journalism Forum. Associate Professor of Art Lynette Lombard lauded Grant for his body of work starting in 1963. \\"Clint Grant's work for the Dallas Morning News made him one of this country's most important photojournalists. Through his photography, he has helped establish photojournalism as one of our most important forms of documentation of the public record\\". Clint Grant died of heart failure in his Dallas home in 2010. Myrtis Grant, his wife of nearly 71 years, died in Dallas six months later. See also *Ike Altgens *Mal Couch *Robert H. Jackson *Cecil W.

It was for many centuries successively the seat of two of the leading families of North Devon, the Beaumonts and their heirs the Chichesters of Raleigh, Pilton, both of which families were seated at the estate of Youlston within the manor of Shirwell. The manor house which survives today known as Youlston Park is one of the most architecturally important historic houses in North Devon and exists largely in its Georgian form, but retains many impressive late 17th- century interiors.Pevsner & Cherry, The Buildings of England: Devon, London, 2004, pp. 925–927, Youlston Park, called \\"one of the most rewarding (houses) in North Devon\\" Descent of the manor de Meulles In the Domesday Book of 1086 it was one of the 176 landholdings in Devon held in-chief by Baldwin de Meulles, Sheriff of Devon, who held the largest fiefdom in Devon and was the 1st feudal baron of Okehampton. Baldwin de Meulles' tenant at Shirwell as listed in Domesday Book was \\"Robert de Beaumont\\". The Courtenay family, later Earls of Devon, were from 1219 the successors to the feudal barony of OkehamptonSanders, I.J., English Baronies, Oxford, 1960, p.70 and thus continued as overlords of Shirwell into the 13th century, as recorded in the Book of Fees,Book of Fees p.784, \\"Philip de Bello-Monte holds in Shirewill from the Honour of Okehampton, quoted by Thorn, part 2, notes, 16,65 and beyond. Beaumont of Beaumont-le-Roger, Normandy In the Domesday Book of 1086 Ascerewelle (Shirwell) was one of at least four manors held in Devon, but merely as a mesne lord from Baldwin de Meulles, by the Norman magnate Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester, Count of MeulanThorn, Part 2, 16,65 (c. 1040/50 – 1118), to whom had been granted by William the Conqueror about 91 English manors in several counties for his service in the Norman Conquest of England. These four manors tenanted by Robert are listed consecutively within the section in Domesday Book listing Baldwin's holdings, as Shirwell, Ashford and two manors called Loxhore, thought to correspond to today's adjacent settlements of Higher Loxhore and Lower Loxhore. Robert is listed as the tenant of Shirwell simply as \\"Robert\\", but his next three holdings are listed in the Exon Domesday with Robert's appellation de Bello Monte added (the Latinised form of de Beaumont), in the form \\"Robert de Beaumont also holds...\\" This leaves no doubt that Shirwell too refers to Roger de Beaumont. There exist many other Devon manors held by persons called \\"Robert\\" but none can be identified with certainty to Robert de Beaumont. These four manors stayed for many generations within a line of the Beaumont family, seated at Youlston within the parish of Shirwell. Surviving records do not allow a definite familial link to be made between the Norman Beaumonts and the Beaumonts of Shirwell, but the Beaumont family historian Edward Beaumont in his 1929 work The Beaumonts in History. A.D. 850–1850, hazarded a guess that the Devon family descended from Robert's third son Hugh de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Bedford (born 1106).Beaumont, Edward T., The Beaumonts in History. A.D. 850–1850. Oxford, c. 1929, p.58 de Poilley A confusion arises as to the early tenure of Shirwell as another manor named Sirewelle is listed in Domesday Book as held in demesne by William of Poilley, as one of his 21 Devon holdings, but all held as a tenant-in-chief of the king, not from Baldwin the Sheriff.Thorn, 1985, 21,2 This manor was held before the Norman Conquest by Wulfward, whilst the Beaumont manor of Shirwell was held previously by Brictmer. It may be that the Beaumont part was Youlston whilst the remnant of today's parish was held by de Poilley, whose share was in that case certainly acquired by the Beaumont family at an early time.Thorn, 1985, part.2, notes, 21,2, de Poilley's holding stated in the opinion of the editors to be within Shirwell Hundred Beaumont of Devon The descent of Beaumont of Youlston, Shirwell is given in the Heralds' Visitation of Devon Vivian, 1895, p.65 as follows: *Sir Richard de Beaumont (13th century). The earliest positively identifiable descendant of the Domesday tenant Robert de Beaumont was the 13th-century Sir Richard Beaumont, whose family had long been seated at the capital estate of Youlston within the manor of Shirwell. His eldest son and heir was Philip Beaumont (died c. 1272), of Youlston, and his younger son was William Beaumont, called in the Heralds' Visitation of Devon \\"of Sabrecot\\", to whom he granted the manor of Loxhore. Sabrecot appears to survive today as an estate calles Shepscott, about 3 miles south of Youlston, and 7 miles south-west of Loxhore Church, anciently known as Shebescote et al.,In Feudal Aids, I, p.361, the fee of Shebescote in the manor of Shirwell, was held from the (Courtenay) feudal baron of Okehampton by Robert Beaupel (Thorn, Domesday Book, Devon, part 2, (notes) 16,65) (probably of the Beaupel family of Landkey) and this branch of the family eventually inherited Shirwell also, on the failure of the senior male line. *Philip Beaumont (died c. 1272), eldest son and heir, of Youlston married Ermengard Punchardon, daughter and co-heiress of Sir John Punchardon of Heanton Punchardon in Devon. This family were listed in Domesday Book as de Pont-Chardon holding Hantone, also as tenants of Baldwin the Sheriff. *Sir John Beaumont (died 1330), eldest son and heir, of Youlston, MP for Devon in 1326, who married Alice Scudamore.Beaumont, T., p.61 * John Beaumont, son and heir, who married Alice, of unknown family. *William Beaumont, only son and heir, who died childless leaving his sister Joan Beaumont as his heiress. *Joan Beaumont (sister) was the wife of Sir James Chudleigh. She too died without children and the Beaumont estates, now enlarged by the addition of the Punchardon lands, passed to her cousin John Beaumont (died 1378/80), of Sepscott. *John Beaumont (died 1379/80), of Sepscott, (cousin), was a grandson of William Beaumont, who had been granted Loxhore by his father Sir Richard Beaumont, and son of Richard Beaumont. John Beaumont married Joane Crawthorne (or Crawstone), the heiress of her grandfather Sir Robert Stockey, MP in 1318. He purchased the North Devon manor of Parkham.Beaumont, T., p.62 His daughter Catherine Beaumont (died 1435),Maxwell-Lyte, Part I, p.105 married Sir Hugh Luttrell (c.1364–1428),Maxwell-Lyte, Part I, p.78 feudal baron of Dunster, of Dunster Castle in Somerset. Alabaster effigies survive in Dunster Church of Hugh Luttrell and his wife Catherine Beaumont, badly mutilated.Maxwell-Lyte, Part I, p.103; see illustration between pp.104–5 The arms of Beaumont (Barry of six vair and gules) appear in Dunster Church and on the Luttrell Table Carpet, c.1520, now in the collection of the Burrell Collection in Glasgow. Also on the sculpted stone heraldic panel, erected by Sir Hugh Luttrell (died 1521) above the western arch of the Gatehouse to Dunster Castle.Maxwell-Lyte, Part II, p.547 Willington effigies in their present location in Atherington Church, north side of chancel, on a 19th-century plinth. The Willington armorial saltire is still visible, much worn, on the knight's surcoat covering his chest *William Beaumont (son and heir), was Sheriff of Devon in 1399,Pole, Sir William, Collections Towards a Description of the County of Devon and held the Castle and Borough of Barnstaple. He further increased the family's estates by marrying Isabel Willington, daughter of Sir John Willington of Umberleigh, and co-heiress of her brother John Willington (died 1396). The effigies of a Willington knight beside his Lady existed in Umberleigh Chapel prior to their removal to Atherington Church in about 1820, where they are visible today. *Sir Thomas Beaumont (1401–1450), son and heir, born at the Willington manor of Yate in Gloucestershire. He married twice, the offspring of which two marriages became successively heirs to his estates, in a complex series of inheritances. Firstly he married Phillipa Dynham, daughter of Sir John Dynham and aunt to John Dynham, 1st Baron Dynham (died 1501),Vivian, Heralds' Visitations of Devon, 1895, p.46 by whom he had 3 sons and 2 daughters. From these children descended two important parallel lines: Firstly an adulterous line of the Bodrugan family which adopted the name Beaumont and which inherited the Beaumont manor of Gittisham, and secondly the later very influential Basset family which inherited the Beaumont former Willington manor of Umberleigh, (which became their early seat) and the Beaumont former Pont- de-Chardon manor of Heanton Punchardon, which became their later seat. Secondly Sir Thomas Beaumont married Alice Stukeley, daughter of Hugh Stukeley of Affeton, Devon, by whom he had a further 3 sons, from one of whom was descended the Chichester family of Raleigh, which inherited the Domesday Book Beaumont manors of Shirwell and Loxhore and which moved its seat from Raleigh to Youlston in the late 17th century. Descent from Sir Thomas Beaumont (died 1450) *Firstly he married Phillipa Dynham, daughter of Sir John Dinham (1359–1428) of Kingskerswell and aunt to John Dynham, 1st Baron Dynham (1433–1501), by whom he had three sons and two daughters: **Richard Beaumont, his eldest son who died childless before his father. **William Beaumont (1427–1453), second son, who married Joan Courtenay, said to have been a daughter of his contemporary \\"Sir William Courtenay\\" (1428–1485) of Powderham, more probably of the latter's father Sir Philip Courtenay (1404–1463).\\"Sir William Courtenay\\", per Vivian, Beaumont pedigree p. 66, but not mentioned in the pedigree of Courtenay of Powderham, p.246. Any daughter of Sir William Courtenay (1428–1485) would surely have been too young to marry William Beaumont (1427–1453), who died aged 26 The marriage was childless but Joan had an extra-marital affair with Sir Henry Bodrugan of Cornwall, whom she later married after her first husband's death. A son was born to Joan named John Bodrugan, who claimed to have been the son of William Beaumont, and after a lengthy legal case was granted the subsidiary Beaumont manor of Gittisham and changed his family name to Beaumont. This family continued several generations at Gittisham. thumb200px On a brass escutcheon on the monument to Sir John Basset (1462–1528) of Umberleigh in Atherington Church, possibly removed from the Umberleigh Chapel, the arms of Bassett Barry wavy of six or and gules (1st & 4th) quarter Beaumont (2nd quarter) and Willington (3rd quarter) Effigy of Blanche Bourchier (died 1483), wife of Philip Beaumont (1432–1473), Shirwell Church **Philip Beaumont (1432–1473), third son, MP in 1467 and Sheriff of Devon in 1469.Beaumont, T, p.64, quoting: \\"Transactions of the Devonshire Society, Vol.50, p.445\\" He married Blanche Bourchier (died 1483),Blanche Bourchier died 4 January 1483 (Vivian, p.106); Pevsner, Nikolaus & Cherry, Bridget, The Buildings of England: Devon, London, 2004, p.728 \\"said to be Blanche St Ledger (died 1483)\\" of whom a stone effigy exists in Shirwell Church, daughter of William Bourchier, 9th Baron FitzWarin (1407–1470), feudal baron of Bampton in Devon. She survived her first husband and married secondly Bartholomew St Ledger of Kent.Vivian, p.106: Latin: de Com. Cantii (\\"from the county of Kent\\") The marriage was childless and Philip bequeathed his estates in two directions: firstly to his nephew Sir John III Bassett (1441–1485)Vivian, p.46 of Whitechapel in Devon, the son of his sister Joan Beaumont who had married John II Bassett (1374–1463) of Whitechapel and of Tehidy in Cornwall, Sheriff of Cornwall in 1449.Vivian, p.46, regnal year 28 Henry VI (1449) The Bassetts received from this bequest the manors of Umberleigh and Heanton Punchardon. The other part of Philip Beaumont's bequest went to his half-brother Thomas Beaumont (died 1487/8) (see below) *Secondly Sir Thomas Beaumont married Alice Stukeley, daughter of Hugh Stukeley of Affeton, Devon, by whom he had three further sons: **Thomas Beaumont (died 1487/8), fourth son, who married Mathye of unrecorded family, and had a son John Beaumont who predeceased his father. Thomas's heir was his younger brother Hugh Beaumont (c. 1457 – 1507). **Hugh Beaumont (c. 1457 – 1507), fifth son, who married Thomasine Wise, daughter and heiress of Oliver Wise of Ford House and Wombwell Court, Devon. Hugh was a co-heir of his half-brother Philip Beaumont (died 1473), and his own heir was his daughter Margaret (or Maud) Beaumont who married John Chichester (1472 – 1537/8) of Raleigh. Thus the manors of Shirwell and Loxhore descended to the Chichester family. **John Beaumont (died 1513), sixth son, a priest who died unmarried and childless.

This book took almost four years to write and Mengestu spent the most of a year revising it. The original version of this novel was published in the UK as Children of the Revolution. The name was changed by the publishers before being published in the US because they did not want the book to sound political.\\"Dinaw Mengestu, novelist\\" The Economist The Beautiful Things That Heaven Bears (2007) was translated into 12 languages, and named a New York Times Notable Book. The book was also awarded The Guardian First Book Award and the Los Angeles Times Art Seidenbaum Award for First Fiction, among numerous other honors.  Plot  Logan Circle, Washington, D.C. The Beautiful Things That Heaven Bears is about an Ethiopian immigrant, Sepha Stephanos, who owns a small grocery store. Stuck between two identities — that of his Ethiopian roots, and that of his American immigrant status — he connects almost immediately with Naomi, a half- black 11-year-old, who moves with her mother, Judith McMasterson, to Logan Circle, the small, run-down neighborhood where Stephanos lives. This is rather remarkable, considering Judith is the first white person to live there: \\"Before Judith, these were the only reasons white people had ever come into the neighborhood: to deliver official notices, investigate crimes and check up on the children of negligent parents\\", but demonstrates the creeping effects of \\"urban renewal\\" or \\"gentrification\\". Because of the dreadful events of his past and the melancholy status of his present, Stephanos is frozen in time, unable to make any progressive steps. He often plays a game with his friends, Congo Joe and Ken the Kenyan, in which they name the many coups of Africa and when they reigned, which demonstrates an unrewarding, nonsensical nostalgia for the place they once called home. Joe clarifies, \\"when the coup stops…so will the game\\" which, from what we see, is a long time coming. Stephanos’ efforts to define himself are somewhat lackluster: although he has lived in America for 17 years, he has shown little growth or signs of assimilation besides his move from \\"Little Ethiopia\\", an apartment building in Silver Spring where Ethiopians maintain their lifestyle and culture, and the founding of his less-than-profitable business. Even in his relationship with Judith, he refuses to take action, besides a kiss that is less of a kiss and more of a \\"pressing\\", as he describes it. Although there are many rather substantial plot developments — from the eviction notice of the store to the escalation of violence against Judith — Stephanos stays resistant to change and growth throughout.  Structure  The story is divided into chapters alternating between the past and present.\\"Exile on P Street\\", The Washington Post This organization of the novel provides another venue for which the topic of loss of identity are brought into the story.  Characters   Sepha Stephanos  Central figure and narrator of the novel, Sepha Stephanos is an Ethiopian immigrant running a shabby convenience store off Logan Circle in Washington. Having fled his home country in the wake of a military coup seventeen years before, Stephanos finds himself isolated in America, condemned to sit alone in his failing store and reminisce about the neighborhood, his position and his past. His only solace comes in the form of two friends, fellow immigrants Kenneth and Joe, as well as Judith and Naomi who have recently moved into Logan Circle. Being an immigrant, Stephanos finds himself caught between the worlds of Ethiopia and America, causing the man to struggle with a sense of identity and placement.\\"African, American\\" Book Review, The New York Times, 25 March 2007  Naomi  Judith's eleven-year-old daughter, Naomi is biracial and perceptively intelligent for her age. At times unruly and prone to fits and running away from her single mother, Naomi and her quirky ways befriend Stephanos through frequent visits to his store where they read books together. Bonded through their mutual loss of fathers, Naomi is comforted by this friendship just as much as Stephanos. Naomi's arrival with her mother to Logan Circle as well as her Caucasian and African background serve to highlight the gentrification and cultural conflicts of the neighborhood.  Judith  Judith is a single mother, having separated from Naomi's Mauritanian father, who moves into Logan Circle and renovates a rundown townhouse adjacent to Stephanos' apartment. Judith was a \\"professor of American political history\\" (Mengestu 54) who often found herself moving around the country with Naomi. Over the course of Judith's stay in Logan Circle, she finds herself in a tentative romantic situation with Stephanos. Judith's position as a well-to-do white woman with a biracial daughter entering a poorer neighborhood further the ideas of gentrification within the novel.\\"A Novelist’s Voice, Both Exotic and Midwestern\\", The New York Times, 16 October 2010  Joseph  \\"Congo Joe\\" as he is referred to, is one of Stephanos' two friends at the beginning of the novel. A fellow immigrant, he worked with Stephanos and Kenneth in a hotel during their first months in America and they bonded over their mutual status as African immigrants. Now working at a well-known restaurant, Joe often writes and reads poetry and fancies himself an intellectual, representing the effects and misconceptions of the American Dream on those arriving to America.\\"Review: Children of the Revolution\\", The Guardian, 2 June 2007  Kenneth  \\"Ken the Kenyan\\" is Stephanos' only other friend, having met together with Joe during their first jobs. Now holding a position as an engineer, Ken is hopeful yet practical of his status and his prospects. Despite his moderate success he finds himself just as out of place as Joe and Sepha, strengthening their bonded friendship.  Berhane Selassie  Berhane is Sepha's uncle and only relative in the United States. After being forced to flee his affluent lifestyle in Ethiopia, Berhane goes to America forced to work for low wages and to hold a second job as a cab driver. Living in a heavily Ethiopian apartment complex, he is extremely nostalgic as evidenved by the collection of letters he keeps carefully tucked away and his reminiscing of the past.  Mrs. Davis  Mrs. Davis is the long time neighbor of Stephanos who can often be found around Logan Circle and sweeping the streets. Her judgmental focus on Judith's presence in the neighborhood as well as her other actions are indicative of stasis and the community's resistance to change.  Themes   The reality of the American dream  A prevalent theme throughout is the notion of the American dream - an immigrant coming to America to escape the unrest in their home country to achieve a better life in America. This is essentially what Stephanos does in escaping a revolution and starting his own business. The title itself is an excerpt from Dante's Inferno, in which Dante is led out of Hell (in the same way an immigrant supposedly is) and offered a look at what is possible. In this case it would be America, and the search for a better life.The Beautiful Things That Heaven Bears: A Review However, a big part in this book is realizing the reality of this dream. Often, the portrayal of Stephanos as a lonely store owner evokes the solitude that all immigrants sometimes feel.Book Review, Ogina Stephanos is faced with challenge after challenge, and his hope and expectations waver throughout his challenging journey towards this better life he thought he was promised.  Gentrification and \\"urban renewal\\"  A prominent theme throughout the book is the rising trend towards gentrification and an \\"urban renewal\\". One can see from the time that Judith moves into the neighborhood that the feeling of the city is changing fast. Judith herself is a prime symbol of this theme, as she brings with her the trend towards this urban renewal that is so fiercely resisted by the community. More than this, there is a clear relation between this gentrification and the life of an immigrant. Just as Stephanos needed to flee Ethiopia, people are being forced out of their neighborhoods. Guns are replaced with eviction notices and people are forced out in much the same way.  Identity and belonging  Stephanos, is faced with the challenge of looking for a sort of home as he enters America. From the time he enters America, he attempts to gain this feeling through the monumental setting of Washington D.C., by owning a shop, by emerging himself in the typical \\"American\\" lifestyle. However, even then the search is not over. Mengestu, in his life as an immigrant has noted that Stephanos \\"is driven by a search for a sort of home ... what I think is a pretty universal and pretty common feeling\\".\\"Dinaw Mengestu Captures Immigrant Life\\" NPR  Departure and arrival  A clear theme throughout is the prevalence of departure and arrival. According to the New York Times, \\"Almost every page reminds us that \\"departure\\" and \\"arrival\\" are deceptively decisive words. Airport terminals, passenger lounges and customs posts cement the illusion that we know when we’re coming and going.\\" As Stephanos continues his journey through his life in America, not only does his past signify the departure aspect, but every action leads him to the observance of a new departure and arrival. He goes from place to place, and in the same way that he feels displaced, he often finds that leaving and coming back are two things central to any life journey - whether they be large scale or small scale.  Friendship  Though this story is focused on Stephanos and his struggle, Rob Nixon of the University of Wisconsin notes that \\"the deeply felt pain in Mengestu’s novel is offset by the solace of friendship — whether it’s a friendship that hovers on the verge of romance, a friendship between an adult and a child or, above all, the friendships that steady the daily lives of fellow immigrants\\". A theme and trend throughout the novel's backbone is the importance of these friendships in getting by. They are intertwined with the notion of immigrants. Though Stephanos often struggles and acts as though he is alone, the notion comes back to relationships and the importance of them in not only the bad parts of life but the good parts as well.

He was a \\"country virtuoso\\" (in the sense used at the time, implying intellectual distinction), and an avowed Baconian. He also has been considered a dilettante. Life He was the son of Robert Childrey of Rochester, where he was born. He was educated at Rochester grammar school, entered Magdalen College, Oxford in the Lent term of 1640,Alumni Oxonienses 1500-1714, Chaffey-Chivers and became one of the clerks. On the outbreak of the First English Civil War he left Oxford and did not return until the city had surrendered to the forces of the parliament. He took his degree of B.A. on 22 July 1646, and is said to have been expelled from his college in 1648 by the Parliamentary visitation of the University of Oxford. Until the Restoration Childrey kept a school, at Faversham in Kent. In 1660 he was appointed by Henry Somerset, Lord Herbert as one of his chaplains, and obtained preferment. Having been created M.A. on 24 January 166l, he was installed on 23 January 1664 as archdeacon of Salisbury, and the same year became a prebendary of Salisbury Cathedral, and was appointed to the rectory of Upwey in Dorset. Childrey died at Upwey on 20 August 1670, and was buried in the chancel of his parish church. Works Childrey adopted firmly the stance proposed by Francis Bacon, that the collection of very full sets of data should precede the formulation of hypotheses. With Edmond Halley, he wrote against the credulous acceptance of travellers' tales. It has been argued, however, that when with Thomas Sprat he advocated more attention to phenomena visible in the skies (\\"meteors\\", in the term used at the time), he was crossing a line drawn by Bacon that excluded \\"prodigious\\" observations. He has been described as a consistent opponent of the interpretation of \\"prodigies\\" in ways relying on divine providence and eschatology. Britannica Baconica mentioned causal explanations of prodigies on its title page, and Childrey took a generally cessationist line. Astrology In the early 1650s, under the Protectorate, Childrey was working with Thomas Streete on astrological tables. He published two short astrological works: *Indago Astrologica, or a brief and modest Enquiry into some principal points of Astrology, 1652, and *Syzygiasticon instauratum; or an ephemeris of the places and aspects of the planets as they respect the ⊙ as Center of their Orbes. Calculated for 1653 (1653). In the Indago Astrologica Childrey, though in other ways a convinced Baconian, argued that Bacon's geocentric model of the cosmos was incorrect. Subsequently he was associated with a group who wished to reform astrology along lines (the heliocentric model and the Baconian method) that would make it compatible with contemporary natural philosophy. Vincent Wing's Harmonicon coeleste (1651) was a related initiative. Others involved were John Gadbury and John Goad. There were supporters of this direction from within the Royal Society, including Elias Ashmole and John Beale. Weather forecasting was another part of the reform programme of Childrey, Gadbury and Goad. The astrological studies were a dead end, but Childrey's Baconian ephemeris was innovative; and he was led into meteorology, supporting an old theory of a 35-year weather cycle. Britannia Baconica Childrey is best known for Britannia Baconica (1660).Britannia Baconica, or the natural rarities of England, Scotland, and Wales, according as they are to be found in every Shire historically related according to the precepts of the Lord Bacon, printed in London in 1660, and issued at Paris in a French translation in 1662 and 1667. Intended as a Baconian natural history, it belonged also to the chorographic natural history tradition, to which Gerard Boate also contributed at the same period. Against the rising English county history genre, it de-emphasised genealogical information, in favour of natural resources. The title alludes to Bacon's Sylva Sylvarum. The work was built up from 100 notebooks, each devoted to one of the topics of the Parasceve of Bacon. The descriptions of the curiosities mentioned in its pages are mostly taken from previous writers, but there are some of Childrey's own observations. One of them was of the zodiacal light. Nathaniel Fairfax found the work too miscellaneous, and the reports often unresolved, and complained about it to Henry Oldenburg. It was popular, however, and is supposed to have influenced Robert Plot's compilation of a Natural History of Oxfordshire. Childrey explicitly recommended a plain style, as Plot did. The work has also been suggested as an influence on Carl Linnaeus when he was writing on Swedish provinces. Tides Childrey made observations on the tides at Weymouth, near Upwey. These led him, around 1669, to contest the views of John Wallis and Samuel Colepresse of Plymouth, on the occurrence of the highest tides in February and November; he attributed their findings mainly to winds. His own work had led him to think the Moon's perigee was relevant. Wallis was already embroiled in correspondence on tides with another \\"country virtuoso\\", Francis Jessop, but Childrey had a better case. The debate arising, on spring tides, was published in the Transactions of the Royal Society, after Childrey had communicated with Seth Ward. The oceanographer George Deacon later criticised Wallis's attitude, and Childrey's view is thought to be closer to the truth.

D. in English literature (under the supervision of Irving Babbitt) from Harvard University in 1920 and 1923, respectively. While completing his doctoral work, Chang served as an attache to the Chinese Delegation at the Washington Disarmament Conference in 1921. Chinese professorship and governmental work Chang returned to China and was appointed professor and chairman of English Literature at Peking National University in 1926. From the years 1928 to 1937 Chang's occupation was governmental rather than academic: he served as the Director of the European and American Department (a subdivision of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs) from 1928 to 1933 and was the Chinese Minister Plenipotentiary to Portugal, Poland, and Czechoslovakia from 1933 to 1937. He entered the Chinese academic world once more, serving as Professor of Western Literature at University of Nanjing, from 1937 to 1940. Return to the United States and death Chang came back to the United States in 1941 to serve as a lecturer on the Chinese war effort. This was his occupation until 1945. Despite his return to academics, Chang maintained ties to the diplomatic sphere. He was a special assistant to the Foreign Minister T. V. Soong in 1943, and was the director of the Chinese United Nations Association from 1947 to 1948. He held a position briefly as a research professor at Long Island University from 1951 to 1953 before joining the faculty of Fairleigh Dickinson University (New Jersey) as a professor of the humanities and East Asian History. This professorship was his last position, one that he held until 1969. Chang died in December 1972 at the age of 74. He passed while in Shanghai on an official visit to the People's Republic of China Personal life Chang married Sang-mi Han in 1927. They remained together until the time of his death. He had two children, a son David, and a daughter, Yi-an. While holding his American professorships, Chang lived at 220 Schenck Avenue, Great Neck, Long Island, New York.

Shotwell Professor of International Relations. He was director of the university's Institute of War and Peace Studies from 1976 to 1986. Biography Schilling was born in Glendale, California, but grew up in Greater St. Louis. He served as a radio operator with the United States Army Air Forces from 1943 to 1946. He received his bachelor's, master's, and Ph.D. degrees from Yale University in 1949, 1951, and 1954, respectively. As an undergraduate at Yale he belonged to Saybrook College, was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and the Yale Political Union, and was pictorial editor for Yale Scientific Magazine. He was part of an era of students motivated to study international relations following World War II because, as he later said, \\"We thought that by studying international politics and foreign policy we might have a part in moving the world in happier directions.\\" He was a research fellow at the Center of International Studies at Princeton University during 1953–54, a lecturer and research associate at Columbia University from 1954–57, and an assistant professor of international relations at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during 1957–58, before coming to Columbia for good in 1958. He married the former Jane Pierce Metzger in 1951 (she had been a teacher of economics who co-authored the 1954 book The Impact of Strikes and would later serve as editor for some of the Institute of War and Peace Studies' published works). The couple raised two sons and lived in Leonia, New Jersey, a town where a number of other Columbia professors lived. He sometimes engaged in academic-oriented presentations and debates in Leonia itself. Schilling (second from right) at a 1969 conference for the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency; his wife Jane P. M. Schilling was also present (far left) Schilling was the co-author of the book Strategy, Politics and Defense Budgets (1962) along with Paul Y. Hammond and Glenn H. Snyder. Writing for the journal Defense Analysis in 1989, Michael D. Yaffe wrote that 25 years later the three authors' \\"insights about defense planning still ring true\\" and that the book was a landmark of defense-policy literature. Schilling's portion, The Politics of National Defense: Fiscal 1950, was an examination of the process by which the U.S. defense budget was arrived at during a time of fundamental change for U.S. security policy and an analysis of the forces at play that made rational choice so difficult. An influential work, two decades later, John Lewis Gaddis commented that it was still the \\"classic discussion\\" of defense spending during that period. Robert J. Art has labeled Schilling, along with contemporaries Richard Neustadt, Roger Hilsman, and Samuel Huntington, as part of the \\"first wave\\" of scholars of foreign policy making. He was also co-author of American Arms and a Changing Europe: Dilemmas of Deterrence and Disarmament (1973) and co-editor of European Security and the Atlantic System (1973). In addition, he published a number of scholarly articles. One of those was regarding the decision by the President Harry S. Truman and the U.S. government to proceed with development of the hydrogen bomb in 1950; in the mid-1950s Schilling interviewed virtually every participant in that decision, and gave public lectures on the subject, but a book-length treatment of the decision did not incorporate these interviews until after his passing. He was recipient of one of the Guggenheim Fellowships awarded in 1964. At Columbia, he became a full professor in 1967. He served on a faculty committee investigating university recruiting policies. At one point in 1967, he was mentioned in the Columbia Daily Spectator as a possible candidate under consideration to become Dean of Columbia College Schilling with students during a 1969 conference at the United States Military Academy at West Point During the Columbia University protests of 1968 that split the faculty and campus, Schilling was considered one of the more vocal of the conservative faculty members, opposing the demonstrators and their spokesperson Mark Rudd and supporting the position of the university administration. (Off campus, the politics of any of these \\"conservatives\\" was often anything but, and they were uncomfortable with such labels when their goal as they saw it was simply the restoration of order in American and European academies.) Shortly after midnight at the start of April 25, 1968, the third day of student protests and occupations, Schilling was part of a faculty delegation unsympathetic to the protesters that entered the occupied portion of Low Library to attempt a dialogue with them; it went nowhere. That evening, he spoke to a large gathering of like-minded students and faculty at Wollman Auditorium and gained applause after proclaiming, \\"if Mark Rudd is still at Columbia in the fall, I will not be.\\" On the evening of April 26, he was part of a press conference in which several faculty members endorsed a moderate student group called the Majority Coalition that wanted to prevent the granting of amnesty to the occupying students; Schilling said he had \\"high admiration for [the] conduct\\" of the counter-demonstrators. He was one of several professors to propose that the faculty themselves cordon off Low Library to prevent free entry and exit of the demonstrators and seize the university identification cards of those leaving. On April 28, he was part of a line of faculty formed outside Low Library that sought to prevent violence among students. He supported the administration's April 30 decision to bring in the police to clear the buildings, saying it was \\"a horrible decision to make [but] the right one\\". Schilling subsequently faulted colleague Alan Westin, leader of a faculty group more sympathetic to the demonstrators, and others in that group, for engaging in behavior that turned what he thought would have been a manageable student-administration conflict into \\"a disaster\\". In 1973, Schilling was named the James T. Shotwell Professor of International Relations. Schilling as director of the Institute of War and Peace Studies in 1985 He served as director of the university's Institute of War and Peace Studies from 1976 to 1986, taking over from Professor William T. R. Fox, who had founded the institute twenty-five years earlier. Schilling had previous served as associate director of the institute beginning in 1968. (Schilling was one of those influenced by Fox, having been his student back at Yale.) As director, Schilling endeavored to keep the institute's funding sources and physical space from being encroached upon by other parts of the university. Schilling also lectured at the National War College, West Point, the Army War College, the Army Command and General Staff College, the Air Force Academy, and the Foreign Service Institute in the U.S., and the Imperial Defence College and the Royal Naval College in the U.K. His appearance in Japan in 1969 to discuss the impact of MIRV warheads on the strategic nuclear balance was covered in the Yomiuri Shimbun. He also served as a consultant for the U.S. Department of State and Department of Defense. He was a resident fellow at The Bellagio Center in 1975. He was a member of the International Institute for Strategic Studies and the Council on Foreign Relations. Schilling made a number of media appearances, including on Edward R. Murrow's Hidden Revolution radio series in 1959, where he described the effects of a surprise Soviet nuclear attack on the U.S.; on New York local television station news and public affairs programs to discuss international events;For example, appearances on WNEW-TV in April 1963 \\"NATO and Nuclear Arms: Two Approaches to Military-Defense Policy\\" and January 1964 \\"The Likelihood of Limited War\\" and appearances on WCBS-TV on a special program on November 23, 1963 and again in February 1964 \\"LBJ After 90 Days\\". and on the CBS Morning News in 1982 to discuss the ongoing Falklands War. He was quoted in newspapers over several decades, often emphasizing the need to appreciate a broad sweep of history to understand current developments. A 1986 front-page story in the Portland Press Herald displayed his quote, \\"Statesmen very rarely decide to have a war – they usually decide to risk a war,\\" meaning that miscalculations in those risk assessments sometimes result in wars taking place that they never would have chosen. Schilling talking to students after one of his \\"Weapons, Strategy, and War\\" classes in 2008 Schilling was known for his teaching, which included courses such as \\"American Strategies in World Politics\\", \\"Causes of War\\", and \\"Weapons, Strategy, and War\\". The last of these was a popular course that, according to the university, \\"became legendary among undergraduates and graduate students\\", and which he was still teaching well into his eighties. Each year, while observed by a university security officer, he brought an unloaded, World War I-era rifle to class to allow students to physically imagine what using it in battle would be like. A panel session at the International Studies Association 2009 annual conference in New York commemorated his teaching and mentoring contributions in the field of security studies. As Stacie E. Goddard, one of the organizers of the session, said, \\"We all felt it was important to recognize the influence Warner has had on our teaching.\\" In a 2003 profile by The Christian Science Monitor, Schilling said that students were more oriented towards academic careers than they had been in years past, but were less knowledgeable about history and geography and less personally vulnerable to decisions about war and peace. On the importance of studying history, he said, \\"There are a whole host of questions that, even if you are only interested in the here and now, can best be answered by looking backward. It requires a greater leap of faith than I am willing to undertake to think that people are brighter in the year 2003 than they were in 1903 or 1803 or 1703. There are some things which have changed, but I don't think there have been any major new innovations in human intelligence or human emotions. If you are interested in the human animal and how the human animal behaves in different circumstances, a study of past behavior, or in this case, history, is one very useful way of building up your working capital, insight, and knowledge.\\" He died in Englewood, New Jersey, on October 20, 2013, at age 88. Schilling was a perfectionist who had trouble finishing writing projects during his lifetime.Young, Super Bomb, p. xii. After his death, unfinished works of his – regarding assassination as an instrument of foreign policy, and his interviews and conclusions regarding the aforementioned H-bomb decision – were published in collaboration with other authors and scholars.

Written in response to an order to expel all officers serving in the State of Qin who were not born in Qin, it successfully persuaded King Zheng to rescind the expulsion order, and also began Li Si's career as a leading politician in Qin. Background During the Warring States period, it was common practice for learned men whose careers might have been frustrated in their homelands to travel to other countries in search of service and patronage. Li Si himself was such an individual, having been born in the State of Chu but unable to progress in an official career there. The initial policy of openness to outsiders changed in 244 BC, due to the controversy surrounding the Zhengguo Canal; the State of Han had dispatched Zheng Guo, a skilled engineer, to Qin on the pretext of helping them build an irrigation canal. Subsequently, however, it was discovered that this was really a scheme by Han to weaken Qin by diverting its resources towards canal construction. At the instigation of a clique of officials within the Qin court, suspicion soon became widened to include all guest officers from outside Qin, and King Zheng issued an order to expel all foreigners. Li Si, himself a foreigner, was also caught up in the purge; his petition was composed while he was being expelled from Qin. King Zheng finally accepted Li Si's suggestion and withdrew the order. Twenty years later, King Zheng unified ancient China and became the first Emperor of the whole China.

In preclinical studies alstonine attenuates MK-801-induced hyperlocomotion, working memory deficit and social withdrawal. It also possesses anxiolytic- like effects in preclinical studies, attenuates amphetamine-induced lethality and stereotypy as well as apomorphine-induced stereotypy, and attenuates haloperidol-induced catalepsy. These effects appear to be mediated by stimulation of the 5-HT2C receptor. In addition, alstonine, similarly to clozapine, indirectly inhibits the reuptake of glutamate in hippocampal slices. Unlike clozapine however, the effect of which is abolished by the D2 receptor agonist apomorphine, alstonine requires 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors to produce this effect, as it is abolished by antagonists of these receptors. Also unlike clozapine, alstonine lacks pro-convulsant activity in mice.

Her best known works include Stone Drawing for St John's College, Oxford, completed in 2019, and Henslow's Walk at Sainsbury Laboratory, University of Cambridge, winner of the Stirling Prize 2012.  Biography  Heron was born in Welwyn Garden City in 1949. Her family moved from London to Eagles Nest, Cornwall in 1955. She is the younger daughter of the painter Patrick Heron and Delia Heron (née Reiss) and sister of architect Katharine Heron. She was educated at Penzance Girls Grammar School and studied at Falmouth School of Art (1967–68) and Central School of Art and Design, London (1968-1971).  Exhibitions  Heron’s first exhibition of sculpture was shown at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in 1985, displaying wall works with small sculptures including Frieze (1983–84), a series of small gilded silver shapes with a circle in common, \\"Heron's first fully mature statement\\". This was followed by exhibitions at Plymouth Arts Centre (1986), The Showroom (1987), Camden Arts Centre (1989), and Newlyn Art Gallery (1992)'Susanna Heron: New Work - Sculpture and Photographs', pamphlet accompanying Exhibition at Newlyn Art Gallery, (7 November – 5 December 1992) A defining group of works at this time entitled Shima included small bronze sculptures, cibachrome photographs, and an artist's book Shima: Island and Garden, each represented in the Arts Council Collection. The works came out of Heron’s involvement in the regeneration of the garden at Eagles Nest in 1987 following a severe frost and \\"… concern things unseen, buried, underground, internal, subconscious; involving sources of energy, generators, messengers, nerves and roots\\". In 2003 Heron installed wall drawings for her exhibition Elements at the Mead Gallery, Warwick Arts Centre, which originated in 36 painted drawings in black, made for a commission in Tokyo in 2001. The same drawings were recreated as tiny woodcuts in Japan, the Palm Prints, part of a body of work to be transformed through location, scale and substance. \\"Like mathematical systems, they are elements, essences, reproducible at any size … but the experience of the works is specific, rooted in a particular time and place.\\"  Selected site specific works  Slate Frieze, Detail, 1993 In 1993 Heron was awarded her first site specific commission Slate Frieze, 23 rectangular slabs of engraved slate over a 21m length wall, installed at the Council of the European Union, Brussels in 1995. A series of high profile commissions followed including Waterwindow, part of the Phoenix Initiative (a Millennium Urban Regeneration Scheme), a waterfall and window sited at the change in levels in Priory Place, Coventry. The splash from the waterfall is continuously recorded in the build-up of green patina on copper panels, evolving and changing over time to form a water-sensitive drawing. Heron was made an honorary Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1999 for her contributions to architecture. In 2009 Heron was commissioned to make a new work entitled Henslow’s Walk for the Sainsbury Laboratory, University of Cambridge with Stanton Williams, winner of the Stirling Prize in 2012. The work comprises four double images carved in shallow relief on a 22m length interior wall; inspired by John Stevens Henslow and his collations of native plants. \\"Employing her favoured medium of drawings in shallow relief, Heron has created a backdrop to the Laboratory’s lecture theatre intricately carved into the yellow French limestone, which forms part of the fabric of the building.\\" Heron collaborated with Bennetts Associates between 2012-15 to make Travertine Frieze, a shallow carving in negative relief of floor to ceiling drawn lines. It forms the side wall to the main entrance of 40 Chancery Lane cut in travertine marble. (Winner of RIBA London Award 2017 and RIBA National Award 2017). Heron continues her interest in large scale stone relief with a commission for St John's College, Oxford, with Wright & Wright Architects. Stone Drawing, cut from Clipsham stone, occupies both the external and internal faces to the wall of a new study centre at St John’s College Library adjacent to the baroque Canterbury Quad. At 6 metres high and 20.4 metres long, it forms the west side of the new building. The work is in part derived from a series of small painted red drawings in oil paint incorporating abstract profiles and sequences. \\"A negative relief, like an engraving, is carved from a flat surface.

The brewery continued to produce beer under the Neubrandenburg and Nordbräu brand names until the company ended production in 1995. The Nordbräu brand was sold to the Mecklenburg brewery Lübzer in 1996.  History  The origin of the Janssen & Bechly Brewery began with an older Neubrandenburg brewery established by Franz Moncke in 1847 and purchased by Friedrich Bechly about 1900. Franz Moncke's brewery was located on Treptower Strasse, Neubrandenburg, and was popular for its Bavarian style bottom-fermenting beer.

The fighting was between the government of the Central African Republic's former Séléka coalition of rebel groups, who are mainly from the Muslim minority, and the mainly Christian anti-balaka coalition. The conflict was part of the ongoing Central African Republic Civil War (2012–present). International organisations, such as the United Nations, had warned of a possible genocide. UNSC resolution 2122 authorised the African-led International Support Mission to the Central African Republic (MISCA) to be deployed to the country, and France to lead operations with additional troops sent to bolster its force in the country. Following a summit of Economic Community of Central African States (CEEAC), including the attendance of all the country's MPs, Djotodia resigned from the presidency on 10 January 2014. The National Transitional Council chose Bangui mayor Catherine Samba-Panza as interim president on 20 January 2014. A period of lawlessness prevailed during the early days of her presidency with people moving into religiously cleansed neighbourhoods as the UN warned of a genocide. Anti-Balaka attacks continued against Muslim civilians.  Background  The Central African Republic Bush War (2004–2007) began with the rebellion by the Union of Democratic Forces for Unity (UFDR) in North-Eastern CAR, led by Michel Djotodia, after François Bozizé seized power in 2003. This quickly escalated into major fighting during 2004. During this conflict, the UFDR rebel forces fought the CAR government concurrently with several other rebel groups that were located in other parts of the country, including the Groupe d'action patriotique pour la libération de Centrafrique (GAPLC), the Convention of Patriots for Justice and Peace (CPJP), the People's Army for the Restoration of Democracy (APRD), the Movement of Central African Liberators for Justice (MLCJ), and the Front démocratique Centrafricain (FDC). On 13 April 2007, a peace agreement between the government and the UFDR was signed in Birao. Further negotiations resulted in an agreement in 2008 for reconciliation, a unity government, and local elections in 2009 and parliamentary and presidential elections in 2010. The new unity government that resulted was formed in January 2009. Rebels in northern Central African Republic in June 2007. In 2012, the Séléka alliance conflict began against the government of François Bozizé. Though there were intermittent halts in the fighting, the group eventually took over the capital, Bangui and Bozizé fled the country. CEEAC brokered an agreement forming a transitional assembly, the National Transitional Council (CNT); the body then chose Michel Djotodia to lead the country to an election. Militarisation Since the Bozizé government was ousted, the writ of the state has apparently been effected with a prevalence of \\"insecurity\\" as a result of the proliferation of armed groups. Though state institutions were already considered weak by Western norms, they disintegrated following looting and the destruction of most of the country's administrative, police and judicial infrastructure. Séléka's leadership failed to have effective control over the various armed forces within its coalition, thus, despite being officially dissolved on 13 September, its former constituents are still able to carry on. Furthermore, fighting between various armed forces has affected many parts of the country. Militarisation has been at further risk over the emergence of militias opposed to Séléka; on the Séléka side, the participation of significant numbers of fighters from Chad and Darfur, Sudan has heightened the risk of cross-border movement of armed groups, as well as small arms. Fighting Since the new government came to power fighting has continued throughout the country with a law and order problem and other instances of violence such as sexual violence. There has also been ethno-religious fighting between the Muslim and Christian communities. Further there have been concerns of Islamists setting up a base in the country, including Boko Haram who are already present in neighbouring Cameroon. The increasing violence was largely from reprisal attacks on civilians from Séléka's mainly Muslim fighters and Christian militias called \\"anti-balaka\\", meaning 'anti-machete' or 'anti- sword'. As many Christians had sedentary lifestyles and many Muslims were nomadic, claims to the land were yet another dimension of the tensions. According to Human Rights Watch, Séléka gunmen killed at least 40 civilians, and intentionally destroyed 34 villages or towns from February 11 to June 2, 2013. Witnesses said the attackers were Séléka fighters in uniform, sometimes in cooperation with armed Mbarara – nomadic pastoralists who move their cattle between Chad and the Central African Republic – who traveled on horseback or motorcycle. The Séléka fired on civilians, often while they were fleeing. In August 2013, the UN Security Council warned that the Central African Republic poses a \\"serious threat\\" to regional stability following the rebel takeover in March and there had been \\"a total breakdown in law and order\\". More than 200,000 people fled their homes and many are living rough in the bush, said UN humanitarian chief Valerie Amos, who had visited the country. Save the Children spokesman Mark Kaye reported that the country's healthcare system was in ruins after being looted: \\"All the pharmacies have been hit. There are no medications, no drugs, equipment has been stolen. I've been to hospitals where even the mattresses have been stolen.\\" In August 2013, the deposed President Francois Bozize told French media he intended to return to power and see the rebels ousted, and had formed the Front for the Return of Constitutional Order in the CAR (French: Front pour le retour de l'ordre constitutionnel en Centrafrique or FROCCA), a group aiming to bring the world's attention to actions of Séléka and their reported crimes. Disbandment of Séléka and start of hostilities In September 2013, Michel Djotodia announced that Séléka had been dissolved but most of the militias refused to disband. There were reports of widespread rape, killing, looting and destruction of villages and administrative systems by these militias. \\"Heavy fighting\\" between unidentified armed groups in and around the towns of Bossembele and Bossangoa was reported in mid-September 2013. Nearly 400,000 people were displaced, mostly to the bush, and 68,000 had fled to neighboring counties. Torture, killings and looting were suggested to have become widespread as chaos spread. Sectarian conflict Refugees of the fighting in the Central African Republic, January 19, 2014 In November 2013, the UN warned the country was at risk of spiralling into genocide and said it was \\"descending into complete chaos\\", while France described the country as \\"...on the verge of genocide.\\" The increasing violence was largely from reprisal attacks on civilians from Sélékas mainly Muslim fighters and Christian militias called \\"anti-balaka\\", meaning 'anti-machete' or 'anti-sword'. As many Christians had sedentary lifestyles and many Muslims were nomadic, claims to the land were yet another dimension of the tensions. On 4 December 2013, the UN Security Council urgently voted in favor of the resolution that UN MISCA peacekeepers can use all force necessary to protect the lives of civilians, after reports began emerging from the capital Bangui of widespread violence taking place. Hours after the vote, French President François Hollande announced his country is committed to immediate action in order to stop the wave of killings, saying he has \\"decided to act immediately, in other words, this evening. Local witnesses and aid workers on the ground in the capital reported at least 105 bodies had been collected after heavy clashes broke out between the mainly Muslim former rebels currently in charge of the country and a mix of local Christian militia and fighters loyal to ousted president Francois Bozize. In addition to the authorization of force, the Security Council resolution imposed an arms embargo on the country and asked the UN to prepare for a possible peacekeeping mission. French soldier in position in Bangui. On 6 December 2013, the local branch of the Red Cross announced that a total of 281 bodies had been collected after two days of violence in and around the capital Bangui. An official confirmed that the toll was expected to rise significantly, as workers had to stop as night fell. During these clashes, 10 armed attackers of unknown affinity in a pickup truck attacked a French army patrol near Bangui airport. The French troops however overpowered the gunmen, killing four of them, injuring six and destroying their truck. This was the first military engagement in France's intervention in CAR. Thousands of Christian civilians sought refuge at the French-held airport from the mostly Muslim ex-rebels. By 8 December, the death toll had reached 394 and by 9 December, 465 people had been killed in total. Amnesty International supported the number of around 400 dead as the official count, but estimated that as many as 1,000 people may have been killed, with many hastily buried before they could be accounted for. The ICRC claimed that at least 500 people had died during the 7–8 December weekend and the following week. However, the number does not include Muslim casualties who were taken instead to mosques for burial. Another 160 people were killed in the rest of the country, according to the UNHCR, who also gave figures of 450 dead in Bangui. Its spokesman, Afrian Edwards, said: \\"We are seeing a further deterioration in the situation in Central African Republic.\\" The UNHCR's Maurice Azonnankpo said: \\"We have noticed several cases of traumatized people, a few cases of survivors of gender-based violence, and also a few cases of separated children [from] their families. We have our teams at all the [internally displaced persons] sites where they are conducting distribution of non-food items... to respond to the needs of these IDPs in Bangui.\\" In Bohang village, the anti-Balaka targeted and killed 27 Muslims. On 8 December, a hospital was also attacked after ex-Séléka rebels attacked the Amitie hospital at night pulling out those injured in the hospital and shooting them resulting in at least 10 deaths before the hospital was abandoned. The next day, the government had ordered all but the foreign peacekeepers and presidential guard off the streets. On 13 December, African peacekeepers fired warning shots into a mob targeting Muslims who had taken refuge in a church compound. The next day, sectarian fighting continued in the capital between gangs of Christian and Muslim youths following a night in which a Christian taxi driver was killed by the former Séléka fighters. Civilians were said to be concerned about a cycle of retaliatory violence. On the same day, French forces backed by air power fought against the rebels; French Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian also arrived in the country to meet troops and commanders. On 15 December, Djotodia talked with both militias and considered a possible amnesty for both sides. An Al Jazeera crew in the country reported seeing burnt Muslim houses standing empty with the former residents having left. In addition to homes having been torched, there were also child soldiers on the streets as at least some were said to have been willing to fight. The violence has spread outside Bangui. An UNHCR spokesman said on 18 December that \\"in Bangui, our staff are reporting continued shooting and a mood of widespread fear. We continue to hear of attacks against Christians by former Séléka [mostly Muslim disbanded militias] with looting, killing and houses being set on fire.\\" On 19 December, a Chadian soldier was injured in an attack while on patrol. Residents in the Gobango neighbourhood reported clashes between rival Muslim and Christian militias, after Chadian soldiers began shooting at civilians. The next day, more fighting occurred leading to at least 37 deaths over 24 hours. One of the incidents included peacekeepers trying to disarm a group of former Séléka rebels that led to the deaths of three rebels and at least one soldier. A mob of young men wearing crucifixes also attacked a mosque and stripped apart the iron roof with one attacker saying \\"we don't want mosques in our country.\\" The government issued a statement that day that read Chadian soldiers had responded to an attack on them by Christian militias who accused them of kidnapping and terrorizing. Late on 22 December, a MISCA Congolese soldier stationed in Bossangoa was killed by hacking by the anti-Balaka fighters. In contrast to the earlier welcome of French soldiers, dozens of Muslims marched in Bangui on 25 December demanding the departure of the French troops. Turning point was suggested to be Hollande's calling for Djotodia to leave, the country's first Muslim president. The day before, the Chadian and Burundian peacekeepers, as a part of MISCA, exchanged fire in Bangui. The Chadians are perceived by the Christian majority of the country during Christmas as being pro-Séléka due to their religion. The head of the Burundian contingent, Lieutenant-Colonel Pontien Hakizimana, said from Bujumbura that his soldiers intercepted and were disarming six former rebels when Chadian troops on a passing truck threw a grenade and opened fire on them, then prompting some Burundian forces to return fire and the Séléka rebels then firing indiscriminately; in the ensuing firefight three Chadians soldiers were wounded. Hakizimana then added that \\"the Chadians soldiers came back in greater numbers in the afternoon and attacked our positions.\\" Eland armoured car of the Chadian Army in Bangui, December 2013. On 20 December, Estonia announced it was considering sending troops to the Central African Republic. On 27 December, two Congolese police officers were killed after unidentified gunmen ambushed them in Bangui. On 29 December, peacekeepers from Rwanda were promised to be sent to the Central African Republic. Sectarian violence continue to escalate, and Djotodia faced pressure from regional leaders due to his apparent inability to control the situation. Djotodia and Tiangaye both resigned at a summit held in N'Djamena on 10 January 2014. Among the chaos in Bangui surfaced accounts of lynching and cannibalism in international media. Foreigners in Central African Republic, especially those from Chad and West Africa, left the country en masse. According to International Organization for Migration, about 60,000 African immigrants asked their embassies for aid. After the resignations of Djotodia and Tiangaye, Alexandre-Ferdinand Nguendet took over as interim leader and speaker of the provisional parliament. On April 10, 2014 the UN Security Council approved a resolution sponsored by the Central African Republic's former colonial power, France, to create a peacekeeping force of over 11,800 soldiers to prevent further sectarian violence. Djotodia resignation On 9 January 2014, Djotodia left for Chad to attend a CEEAC summit amid media speculation he was going to resign, though government officials denied this. The entire 135-member parliament was summoned to the summit in N'Djamena to discuss peace talks, which were suspended on 9 January while awaiting their arrival. CEEAC Secretary-General Ahmat Allami said: \\"If you are incapable, if you are powerless in the face of the situation, make way for others who can do a better job.\\" Likewise, in opening the meeting, host president, Idriss Deby, called for \\"concrete and decisive action\\" to stop the violence. Due to the continued sectarian violence, Djotodia faced pressure from the group's leaders to resign. As a result, after the two-day summit, Djotodia resigned from the presidency on 10 January 2014. A statement by Allami announced the resignation and added that a new leader would be chosen after talks in Bangui. Speaker of parliament, Alexandre-Ferdinand Nguendet, became acting president. Prime Minister Nicolas Tiangaye also resigned. Following the announcement gunfire and celebration occurred in Bangui, including dancing, singing and honking horns in celebration. There were also cheers at a camp for 100,000 displaced Christian civilians at the airport. However, celebrations were marred by rampaging Christian militias, who destroyed mosques, attacked Muslim neighbourhoods and businesses; amid reports some of them engaged in the cannibalisation of a Muslim body in Bangui. Djotodia then left for Benin the next day where he was welcomed at Cotonou airport by Benin's Foreign Minister Nassirou Bako Arifari: \\"Benin accepts to welcome him at the request of member states of the Economic Community of Central African States and it is our contribution to the search for peace in central Africa.\\" Nguendet pledged that the \\"anarchy\\" in the country would swiftly end and warned the warring factions from Séléka and the anti-balaka Christian fighters: \\"To the ex-Séléka, to the anti-balaka and the lovers of looting, I'm giving you a severe warning: The party is over. The chaos is over, the pillaging is over, the revenge attacks are over.\\" Similarly, soldiers and police who had deserted amidst fears of being targeted returned to duty as 12 January was reported as \\"calm.\\" Chief of Staff General Ferdinand Bomboyeke called on the troops to return to their barracks the next day. Colonel Desire Bakossa, who supervised the registration, said that the returnees \\"came in very large numbers and they're still coming. They answered the general's call. It's a relief. It's a very good sign.\\" The same process was also initiated for returning police as Nguendet said that the police, who were absent from the streets of Bangui amidst the latest fighting, would be \\"redeployed within 72 hours and would take part in the disarmament process. On 12 January, reconciliation was reported in the southern Bangui neighbourhood of Bimbo with rival fighters striking a truce and embracing each other. Nguendet also went to the airport, where about 100,000 people were sheltering, to urge them to return home. UN Special Representative Babacar Gaye said that Nguendet's profile could \\"help restore hope\\" and that the international community would have to help on the road \\"to free, credible and democratic elections.\\" Yet the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs' John Ging said the country was in a \\"mega-crisis\\" and warned about the \\"wanton destruction\\" as posing a disaster warning. Foreigners continued to be repatriated by mid-month with 300 Malians returning on 9 January and over 1,000 people expected to return. He said that a large international effort was needed to restore stability. French Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said a new leadership should be announced \\"as soon as possible\\" as \\"the aim is to move forward with elections before the end of the year. We need the National Transitional Council to find a provisional alternative.\\" Foreign Ministry Spokesman Romain Nadal added: \\"We take note of the resignation. It is up to the CNT to decide what happens now. France does not interfere in any case with this process.\\" Humanitarian consequences By the middle of December, 159,000 people were internally displaced persons seeking refuge from the sectarian nature of the conflict in Bangui. Only a few of the 800,000 city's residents were still present while others had sought protection near a French military base and other areas. The airport vicinity housed about 40,000 people. Other aid workers also cited a looming humanitarian crisis with over 500,000 people displaced across the country since the fighting began. Many people are staying by the Bangui M'Poko International Airport. Aid agencies reported being under-equipped to deal with the humanitan consequences, while the instability was worsening the situation. Up to 100,000 people were living in camps in the country. The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) had started to airlift foreigners on 11 January 2014. On one of three charter flights over the weekend, 800 Chadians from a refugee camp near Bangui were repatriated. IOM Director Carmela Godeau issued a statement that read: \\"Several concerned governments including Mali, Senegal, Niger and Chad have already organised evacuation flights, but need additional resources to cope with all the migrants wanting to leave the CAR and those arriving home, who are often destitute. The evacuation of these migrants must be done quickly and in an orderly manner to avoid people trying to leave on their own overland and taking terrible risks, in desperation.\\" Potential repercussions The Lord's Resistance Army, which is facing declining numbers and deaths of leaders in its home base of Uganda, has been attempting to cross into the country. The instability and lawlessness in CAR may provide the LRA an opportunity to re- group and re-organise. Reactions ;Domestic In the second weekend of December, following the death of 400 people in the country, President Michel Djotodia said: \\"It is too much to say I have no control. I control my men. The men I can't control are not my men.\\" On 25 December, Djotodia called for an end to the \\"massacres\\" and said: \\"Love one another! We find that in the Bible and the Koran\\", as he was surrounded by local Christian and Muslim religious leaders. He also announced a ban on all illegal demonstrations in Bangui and accused Bozizé and his supporters of being behind the violence which \\"massacres innocent Central Africans.\\" He had earlier stated that even though he was a Muslim, he accepted that the CAR was a secular state and warned that ill-intentioned people wanted to start inter-religious conflict. ;International In November 2013, the UN warned the country was at risk of spiralling into genocide, was \\"descending into complete chaos\\" and France described the country as \\"...on the verge of genocide.\\" The UNSC passed resolution 2122 ordering the deployment of MISCA for peacekeeping operations. France then sent additional troops to the few hundred already stationed there, bringing their total number of troops in the country to over 1,000. The UK also had support operations. Similarly, the U.S. Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel ordered Africom to coordinate with France in sending its military aircraft to airlift Burundian troops to the country upon the former's urging for support. Following violence in the second weekend of December that killed over 400 people, U.S. President Barack Obama spoke to the \\"proud citizens of the Central African Republic\\" and said they have the power \\"to choose a different path\\" than the violence that took place. On a trip to Africa for the death and state funeral of Nelson Mandela, French President Francois Hollande then arrived in the country on 10 December, the day after the death of two French soldiers from the 8th Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment. Accompanied by Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, he claimed that the intervention was \\"necessary if one wants to avoid carnage here\\" and that instead it \\"was time to act. It was soon going to be too late. [The clashes were] taking on a religious dimension with the risk of leading to a civil war. For weeks, massacres were conducted and horrendous violence was done to women and children. France is not here in the CAR out of any self-interest. France has come to defend human dignity.\\" Upon arriving in the country, their Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said there was a need to end the \\"spiral of atrocities and sectarian violence that is under way. One of your first tasks is to disarm the militias, while ensuring that civilian populations, Muslims as well as Christians, do not become targets of blind reprisals.\\" Fabius said on 15 December, about the possibility of renewed violence after a lull following the UNSC resolution mandating an intervention body, that this \\"is a real, big problem. Tomorrow, I'll go to the Council of Foreign Ministers and I will ask [our European partners] for stepped-up, more robust aid, including on the ground.\\" Various forms of support had already come from Poland, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain and Belgium; however domestic French support for the mission fell after the death of two French soldiers despite continued advocacy by Hollande. Fabius later said that \\"we will soon have troops on the ground from our European colleagues.\\" Unnamed diplomats were reported to have suggested Belgium and Poland could send forces who would then be used to relieve the French forces securing the airport. In accordance with the UNSC resolution, the European Union imposed a ban on arms sales to the country in late December 2013. In early 2014, the EU's state leaders asked Catherine Ashton for options in deploying forces to the country. She suggested a rapid deployment of troops to protect the population and humanitarian facilities. With discussion on the proposal occurring on 10 January, an approval could see 700-1,000 troops sent to the country. The commander of the Burundian battalion arriving in the country, Lieutenant-Colonel Potien Hakizimana, said that his 850 soldiers arrived in the country in mid-December aboard two U.S. military aircraft. The AU announced an increase of its 2,500 troops in the country to 6,000 on 13 December. Rwandan Foreign Minister Louise Mushikiwabo wrote on Twitter that \\"Rwanda was asked by the AU to contribute troops to the CAR and deploy urgently, and yes, right now the RDF is preparing to go,\\" however she did not give a number as to how many soldiers would be sent, instead she said that they will leave \\"very soon\\" as of 20 December. On 14 December, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon warned: \\"Too many people are scared and the country is on the brink of ruin ... I appeal to everyone to follow the path of peace. The bloodshed must stop. I have a clear message to all who would commit atrocities and crimes against humanity. The world is watching. You will be held to account.\\" The day before, UNICEF added that it had flown in tons of supplies, including blankets, jerry cans and medicine. UNHCR's Maurice Azonnankpo said: \\"We have noticed several cases of traumatised people, a few cases of survivors of gender-based violence, and also a few cases of separated children [from] their families. We have our teams at all the [internally displaced persons] sites where they are conducting distribution of non-food items... to respond to the needs of these IDPs in Bangui.\\" Meanwhile, the director of the AU's Peace and Security department, El Ghassim Wane, said: \\"The decision by the Peace and Security Council (PSC) is to authorise us to increase the force. We can go up to 6,000, depending on the needs.\\" Moon later claimed that \\"the entire population of 4.6 million people is affected. And half of them are children.\\" He added that 2013 was the year CAR descended into chaos and that a commission of inquiry was needed to look into reports of atrocities. An UNHCR spokesman said that 210,000 people were displaced. By the first week of 2014, the UN political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman told the UNSC that about 2.2 million people throughout the CAR need assistance. Further, about 513,000 people, or half the population, of Bangui had left their homes and about 100,000 people sought shelter at a camp at the airport. The EU was reportedly considering sending 1,000 troops to support the French forces in the country. ;Media Deutsche Welle drew parallels to other Central African conflicts, in particular that of the Democratic Republic of Congo whose border could be used for further destabilization in the CAR. It also raised the issue of how the conflict in South Sudan has the potential of further destabilizing the region, and stated that the peacekeepers were poorly equipped to deal with these conflicts. Yet it added that MISCA and MONUSCO are important in stopping a \\"conflagration in Central Africa and in guaranteeing lasting peace.\\" Aftermath and continued violence Despite the resignation of Djotodia, conflict still continued.

He graduated in 1984, and became a Dutch citizen and then stayed in the Netherlands. Rozenman worked for six years in New York and Amsterdam beginning in 2007. Rozenman relocated to Berlin, Germany in 2013. Rozenman divides his time living and travelling between Germany and the Netherlands. In 2006, he married the Dutch Democrats 66 politician and human rights activist Boris Dittrich. Description of his sculptures Working with glass as a material fascinates Rozenman. Glass is fragile and vulnerable, but at the same time it is everlasting. Glass can be clear or non-translucent like ceramic, and fragile, or to the contrary, hard and unbreakable. Rozenman's method of working with glass resembles that of a smith, the way he melts a lump of glass in his oven, and then works the glass into abstract shapes. Rozenman's sculptures remind patrons of small architectonic structures, residues of an industrial building in decay; motors and machines rusted through the passing of endless time, or prehistoric creatures fossilized in a piece of amber; the remains of a world that ceased to exist thousands of years ago. The sculptures make a robust impression, threatening, but at the same time they are ambivalent, because decay, and the object's transitory nature are themes that are recurring in his work. Rozenman's sculptures are objects whose essences existed in the past, but seem that they have no present function. What remains is purity and beauty in an unconventional way. Solo exhibitions in museums Rozenman started his career as a painter. In the late nineties he worked with video and in 2005 he began as a sculptor using glass as material, melting it in an oven. Rozenman was successful throughout his career. He exhibited with solo shows in several museums in the world. * His sculpture exhibition ‘Cast images’ (made from perishable material) was shown in 1997 in the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. \\"Joshua Rozenman speelt even dat hij God is, Trouw 31 oktober 1997 * His project ‘Under Cover’ was exhibited in the Museum of Textiles in Barcelona, Spain in 1998. * Cast Images was shown in the Provincial Museum of Modern Art in Hasselt, Belgium in 1998. * His project ‘Moving pictures’ was exhibited in the Museum of Modern Art in Groningen, the Netherlands in 2000. * In 2002 his project \\"Behind the wall of scents\\" was exhibited in the Teffen Museum in Israel and in 2003 in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. * His project ‘Under Cover’ was exhibited in the Van der Togt Museum in Amstelveen, the Netherlands in 2005.

It was published by Gameland between January 1996 and November 2013 when the magazine was suspended due to financial problems. History and profile Starting December 2010, the magazine established a partnership with Japanese magazine Famitsu, publishing the best of their features. Magazine's chief editor Konstantin Govorun notes this allows the publication to cover exclusives prior to releases in English magazines. In an interview with GamesLife.ru, Govorun describes that the magazine has seen a significant growth compared to its early years, now becoming one of the biggest video gaming magazine. He explains the success of the publication with the fact that Russia has a strong PC gamer market and that the few available non-Russian publications, such as Edge or gamesTM, do not share the same target audience. He also notes that the team, including editors, are allowed much freedom in writing columns and that the staff room did not see major changes over the years and considers these factors important for still being in circulation, despite other similar magazines having closed. Sergey Galenkin explains in a Kanobu.ru piece that in comparison to other defunct magazines, Strana Igr has taken care to publish non-sensationalized pieces steadily that match their target audience well. He also noted that the magazine's publisher Gameland runs several other publications and the magazine's online availability are positive factors to remain in circulation. In magazine format, game reviews received a score of up to 10 in 0.5 increments. According to review aggregator Kritikanstvo.ru, Strana Igr published over 3700 game reviews with an average score of 75%.

Each province can pass legislation, where the purpose is to limit rent prices increasing beyond what is affordable for most home dwellers. History Alberta British Columbia Manitoba New Brunswick Newfoundland and Labrador Nova Scotia The Residential Tenancies Act and Regulations are the laws governing the rental of residential property and leading the relationship between the landlord and their tenants in the province of Nova Scotia. Ontario Rent regulation was first introduced in Ontario under the National Housing Act 1944. The Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 is the current law in Ontario that governs landlord and tenant relations in residential rental accommodations. The Act received royal assent on June 22, 2006 and was proclaimed into law on January 31, 2007. The Act repealed and replaced the Tenant Protection Act, 1997 and created the Landlord and Tenant Board as a replacement for the Ontario Rental Housing Tribunal. Rent control in Ontario formerly only applied to units that were first built or occupied before November 1, 1991.http://o.canada.com/business/rent-increase-loophole- leaves-ontario-renters-vulnerable If the rental unit was in an apartment building constructed (or converted from a non-residential use) after November 1, 1991, then the rent control provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 did not apply. On April 20, 2017, Premier of Ontario Kathleen Wynne, along with Chris Ballard, Minister of Housing, announced the Fair Housing Plan. The plan includes a provision to roll-back the post-1991 rent control exemption such that all private rental units, including ones built or first occupied on or after November 1, 1991 will be subject to rent control. This change will be effective April 20, 2017 regardless of when the legislation is passed. Additionally, a concern of negative impact of rent control is that increasing rent prices for continuing tenants are generally smaller than new tenants. Thus, setting this policy might discourage residential mobility, actually a process that change lives and neighborhoods, since rent price increases for continuing tenants are generally smaller than for new residents (Gilderbloom&Markham;, 1996). Prince Edward Island Quebec See Quebec rental board Saskatchewan Current law Alberta In Alberta, there is no limit to the rent amount landlords are permitted to charge. Rents can only be increased once a year for an existing tenant, and notice of rent increase must be provided three months in advance. British Columbia According to Mike Hagar for The Globe and Mail, in BC rents can only be increased once a year for existing tenants. A rent increase cannot exceed 2.9 per cent in 2016. Written notice of a rent increase must be provided three months in advance.https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british- columbia/critics-say-tenants-not-protected-in-bcs-tight- rentalmarkets/article30953117/ Ontario See also *Rent regulation *Rent control in England and Wales Notes References *Consultations to address affordable housing shortage by Laurie Monsebraaten (Toronto Star, 20 July 2009) *Pressure mounts for Ontario to extend rent controls to all tenants by Susan Pigg (Toronto Star, 31 May 2013) *Ontario NDP wants to close rent control loophole by William Wolfe-Wylie (Postmedia News, 4 June 2013) *Gilderbloom, J.

Thereafter, it faces the Western Ghats. Bhor Ghat The Western Ghats presented a big obstacle to the railway engineers in the 1860s. As of now it stretches from Palasdari to Khandala, a distance of . The summit of the Bhor Ghat (earlier spelt as Bhore Ghat) incline being 2,027 feet. The maximum gradient was: 1 in 37 with extreme curvature. \\"The works on the Bhore ghat comprised 25 tunnels of a total length of nearly 4,000 yards, two of the longest being 435 yards and 341 yards respectively. The Bhore ghat have eight lofty viaducts having a total length of 2,961 feet. Two of the largest are more than 500 feet long with a maximum height of 1160 and 163 feet. There are 22 bridges of spans from 7 to 30 feet and 81 culverts of various sizes.\\" On 25 January 1869 a runaway train on the Bhore Ghat derailed and crashed after failing to be stopped by a catch siding, and was made (in)famous by pictures in the Illustrated London News. Deccan Plateau At the edge of the Western Ghats, the hills and valleys around Lonavla and Khandala attract large number of tourists. Lonavla is the starting point of the Pune Suburban Railway. EMU services were introduced in this sector in 1978. Pimpri-Chinchwad is a large industrial zone in the Pune area. Industrialisation of the zone started with the setting up in 1954 of the Hindustan Antibiotics at Pimpri. As of 2013, 6195 industries including 54 large scale 621 medium scale and 5520-small scale industries are in existence. The zone houses several major automotive units and all the major information technology units amongst other industries. Located in Bhima basin, the Solapur area is home to powerloom and handloom textile units, beedi-making units and other industries. History The first train in India from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus in Mumbai to Thane ran on 16 April 1853 on a track laid by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. The GIPR line was extended to Kalyan in 1854 and then on the south-east side to Khopoli via Palasdari railway station at the foot of the Western Ghats in 1856. While construction work was in progress across the Bhor Ghat, GIPR opened to public the Khandala- Pune track in 1858. The Bhor Ghat incline connecting Palasdari to Khandala was completed in 1862, thereby connecting Mumbai and Pune. GIPR extended its line to Raichur in 1871 and met the line of Madras Railway thereby establishing direct Mumbai-Chennai link. The Pune-Raichur sector of the Mumbai-Chennai line was opened in stages: the portion from Diksal in Pune to Barshi Road was opened in 1859, from Barshi Road to Mohol in 1860 and from Mohol to Solapur also in 1860. Work on the line from Solapur southwards was begun in 1865. Barsi Light Railway was a long, wide railway from Kurduwadi to Latur. It was opened in 1897 on a long railway track from Barsi Road to Barsi, and extended in stages. The narrow gauge line from Barsi Road to Pandharpur was extended to Miraj in 1927. Gauge conversion from to of the Miraj-Latur track and extension of the new line to Latur Road was taken up in 1992 and completed in stages. The last phase of the long project was completed in 2008. Electrification The Kalyan-Pune section was electrified with 1.5 kV DC overhead system in 1930. As of October 2016, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, Mumbai-Daund section is completely on 25 kV AC overhead system. Railway tracks beyond Daund are nearing completion with electrification till Bhigwan. The Pune-Solapur- Wadi line is being electrified with a loan of Rs. 1,500 crore from Asian Development Bank. Work was initiated in 2012. There are still major roadblocks while electrifying the track beyond Bhigwan. The focus is to first double the lines all the way till Mohol and also after Solapur towards Gulbarga. Electrification would follow that. One of the biggest challenges is to eliminate the scissors crossing at Pophlaj, Bablad and Hunsihadgil which have been weirdly built on elevated mud embankments - a result of bad planning. These scissors crossings tend to waste a lot of time for trains as they first enter a loop and then reverse to the far end of the loop and once the main line train crosses they are allowed to enter the main line - a sheer wastage of time. Doubling and electrification should eliminate all these technical issues.

He published several travel books as well as being an accomplished artist. A cape in the South Orkneys is named in his honour. Life Burn Murdoch was born in Edinburgh to Jessie Cecilia (née Mack) and Dr. William Burn-Murdoch. His father was the first to take the name Burn-Murdoch, but the hyphen was not used by his son. His elder brother, John Burn-Murdoch, joined the military and became the commanding engineer of state railways in India.H. M. Vibart, 'Murdoch, John Burn- (1852–1909)', rev.

He served as an assistant to William Speirs Bruce, a medical student with an interest in oceanography. Burn Murdoch, who was known as \\"WG\\" to his friends, used this opportunity to create paintings of their journeys and he had a contract to create a book. With these and his notes he wrote the book Edinburgh to the Antarctic which was published by Longmans in 1894. It was said that he was the first \\"Artist in Residence\\" in the Antarctic.William Gordon Burn Murdoch, Geoff Swinney, National Museums Scotland, retrieved 3 December 2013 Burn Murdoch had mixed feelings about the trip. The expedition had been to the Falkland Islands and Ross Island, and had discovered and named Dundee Island, but the scientific role he was expected to help with was undervalued, and both he and Bruce had been obliged to help with killing 5,000 seals which was the expedition's only hope of commercial success as they had failed to find any commercial whales. Despite these setbacks and having his teeth loosened by scurvy he gained a love of polar exploration.Voyage of the Balaena, Glasgow Digital Library, retrieved 3 December 2013 Burn Murdoch continued his friendship with William Spiers Bruce, whom he had first met at university. He helped him by lending him money and later with organising a number of projects including the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition in 1902–04. During that expedition Bruce surveyed Laurie Island in the South Orkneys. Cape Burn Murdoch on that island is named in his honour.William Gordon Burn Mudoch, scottish-places.info, retrieved 3 December 2013 The two of them were later involved with a company that intended to commercially exploit the island of Spitzbergen. In 1905 he travelled with the Prince and Princess of Wales on their visit to India, which he used as the basis for a book describing his travels in India and Burma. In 1906 he was made a fellow of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society, and he remained an active member. The society own a collection of his work, including a large oil painting in its board room. After some commercial whaling he published \\"Modern whaling and bear hunting\\" in 1917, which he again illustrated and which described his interest in polar bears. The Royal Scottish Geographical Society has humorous cartoons he created featuring polar bears. One of his polar bear sketches was used as an RSGS Christmas card. Burn Murdoch also captured polar bears, and gave a young polar bear to the Zoological Society of Scotland. Burn Murdoch died in 1939 in Edinburgh. He and his wife had lived at Arthur Lodge, where they entertained visitors, including Roald Amundsen and Robert Falcon Scott.

Generally, a system of rent regulation involves: *Price controls, limits on the rent that a landlord may charge, typically called rent control or rent stabilization *Eviction controls: codified standards by which a landlord may terminate a tenancy *obligations on the landlord or tenant regarding adequate maintenance of the property *a system of oversight and enforcement by an independent regulator and Ombudsman The loose term \\"rent control\\" covers a spectrum of regulation which can vary from setting the absolute amount of rent that can be charged, with no allowed increases, to placing different limits on the amount that rent can increase; these restrictions may continue between tenancies, or may be applied only within the duration of a tenancy.See the section on Rent regulation#Forms of rent regulation for more detail. As of 2016, at least 14 of the 36 OECD countries have some form of rent control in effect, including four states in the United States. Rent regulation is one of several classes of policies proposed to improve housing affordability, alongside subsidies (including vouchers and tax credits) and policies aimed at expanding the housing supply. There is a consensus among economists that rent control reduces the quality and quantity of housing.See the Economists' views section for the references supporting this statement.  Forms of rent regulation  The loose term \\"rent control\\" can apply to several types of price control: * \\"strict price ceilings\\", also known as rent freeze systems, or absolute or first generation rent controls, in which no increases in rent are allowed at all (rent is typically frozen at the rate existing when the law was enacted) * \\"vacancy control\\", also known as strict or strong rent control, in which the rental price can rise, but continues to be regulated in between tenancies (a new tenant pays almost the same rent as the previous tenant) and * \\"vacancy decontrol\\", also known as tenancy or second-generation rent control, which limits price increases during a tenancy, but allows rents to rise to market rate between tenancies (new tenants pay market rate rent, but increases are limited as long as they remain).  Economics   Theory  Rent price controls remain the most controversial element of a system of rent regulation. Historically, economists such as Adam Smith and David Ricardo viewed landlords as producing very little that was valuable, and so regarded \\"rents\\" as an exploitative concept. (Economists note that the land value tax is a way to capture this unearned value.) Modern rent controls (sometimes called rent leveling or rent stabilization) are intended to protect tenants in privately owned residential properties from excessive rent increases by mandating gradual rent increases, while at the same time ensuring that landlords receive a return on their investment that is deemed fair by the controlling authority, which might, or might not be a legislature. A number of neo-classical and Keynesian economists say that some forms of rent control regulations create shortages and exacerbate scarcity in the housing market by discouraging private investment in the rental market.C Rapkin,The Private Rental Housing Market in New York City (1966) and G Sternlieb, The Urban Housing Dilemma (1972) This analysis targeted nominal rent freezes, and the studies conducted were mainly focused on rental prices in Manhattan, or elsewhere in the United States. The Swedish economist Assar Lindbeck, a housing expert, said that \\"rent control appears to be the most efficient technique presently known to destroy a city – except for bombing\\".  California studies  Historically, there have been two types of rent control - vacancy control (where the rent level of a unit is controlled irrespective of whether the tenant remains in the unit or not) and vacancy decontrol (where the rent level is controlled only while the existing tenant remains in the unit). In California prior to 1997, both types were allowed (the Costa/Hawkins bill of that year phased out vacancy control provisions). A 1990 study of Santa Monica, CA showed that vacancy control in that city protected existing tenants (lower increases in rent and longer stability). However, the policy potentially discouraged investors from building new rental units. A 2000 study that compared the border areas of four California cities having vacancy control provisions (Santa Monica, Berkeley, West Hollywood, East Palo Alto) with the border areas of adjoining jurisdictions (two of which allowed vacancy decontrol, including Los Angeles, and two of which had no rent control) showed that existing tenants in the vacancy control cities had lower rents and longer tenure than in the comparison areas. Thus, the ordinances helped protect the existing tenants and, therefore, increased community stability. However, there were fewer new rental units created in the border areas of the vacancy controlled cities over the 10-year period. A study that compared the effects of local rent control measures (both vacancy control and vacancy decontrol) with other local growth management measures in 490 California cities and counties (including all the largest ones) showed that rent control was stronger than individual land use restrictions (but not the aggregate effect of all growth restrictions) in reducing the number of rental units constructed between 1980 and 1990. The measures (both rent control and growth management) helped displace new construction from the metropolitan areas to the interiors of the state with low income and minority populations being particularly impacted. = 2019 study of the San Francisco housing market = In 1994, San Francisco voters passed a ballot initiative which expanded the city's existing rent control laws to include small multi-unit apartments with four or fewer units, built prior to 1980. (about 30% of the city's rental housing stock at the time). A 2019 study found that San Francisco's rent control laws reduced tenant displacement from rent controlled units in the short-term, but resulted in landlords removing 30% of the rent controlled units from the rental market, (by conversion to condos or TICs) which led to a 15% citywide decrease in total rental units, and a 7% increase in citywide rents. I  Economists' views  In a 1992 stratified, random survey of 464 US economists, economics graduate students, and members of the American Economic Association, 93% \\"generally agreed\\" or \\"agreed with provisos\\" that \\"A ceiling on rents reduces the quantity and quality of housing available.\\" A 2009 review of the economic literature by Blair Jenkins through EconLit covering theoretical and empirical research on multiple aspects of the issue, including housing availability, maintenance and housing quality, rental rates, political and administrative costs, and redistribution, for both first generation and second generation rent control systems, found that \\"the economics profession has reached a rare consensus: Rent control creates many more problems than it solves\\". In a 2012 poll of the 41 leading economists by the Initiative on Global Markets (IGM) Economic Experts Panel, which queried opinions on the statement \\"Local ordinances that limit rent increases for some rental housing units, such as in New York and San Francisco, have had a positive impact over the past three decades on the amount and quality of broadly affordable rental housing in cities that have used them,\\" 13 members said they strongly disagreed, 20 disagreed, 1 agreed, and 7 either did not answer, were undecided, or had no opinion. In a 2013 analysis of the body of economic research on rent control by Peter Tatian at the Urban Institute, he stated that \\"The conclusion seems to be that rent stabilization doesn't do a good job of protecting its intended beneficiaries—poor or vulnerable renters—because the targeting of the benefits is very haphazard.\\", and concluded that: \\"Given the current research, there seems to be little one can say in favor of rent control.\\" Many economists suggest housing subsidies as a way to make housing more affordable to renters without distorting the housing market as much as rent control, but expanding the existing subsidy programs would require sharp increases in government spending. Paul Krugman writes that rent control inhibits construction of new housing, creates bitter tenant–landlord relations, and in markets with not all apartments under rent control, causes an increase in rents for uncontrolled units. Thomas Sowell writes that rent control reduces the supply of housing, and has stated that rent control increases urban blight.  History   Early modern Europe  Rent control was used in Rome as early as 1470 to protect Jewish residents from price gouging. Since Jews in the Papal States were forbidden to own property, they were dependent on Christian landlords, who charged them high rents. In 1562, Pope Pius IV granted Jews the right to own property worth up to 1500 Roman scudi and enacted rent stabilization. In 1586, Pope Sixtus V issued a bull ordering landlords to rent out houses to Jewish tenants at reasonable rates.  Politics   California  A renter named Mario talks about his experience with rent gouging in California in 2019. A survey conducted in 2018 by the Los Angeles Times and the University of Southern California found that 28% of eligible California voters believed that the lack of rent control was the main contributing factor to California's housing affordability crisis. 24% of respondents believed that the most significant cause of the housing crisis was insufficient funding of low-income housing; only 13% believed it was insufficient new housing. In 2018, a statewide initiative (Proposition 10) attempted to repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, which, if passed, would have allowed cities and municipalities to enact \\"vacancy control\\" systems, allowed rent control to be applied to buildings newer than 1995, and would have allowed rent control on single-family homes. (All currently prohibited by Costa-Hawkins.) The proposition failed, 59% to 41%.https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_10,_Local_Rent_Control_Initiative_(2018)  Rent regulation by country   Canada  In Canada, there are rent regulation laws in each province. For example, in Ontario the Residential Tenancies Act 2006 requires that prices for rented properties do not rise more than 2.5 percent each year, or a lower figure fixed by a government minister.  Germany  German rent regulation is found in the \\"Civil Code\\" (the Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch) in § 535 to § 580a.English translation available: §§ 535 ff. BGB As common in German law, regulations are structured into an abstract, more general part that applies to all contracts of a certain type, followed by a more specific section for individual fields of application of this type of contract. Specific regulations for rental contracts governing apartments range from §§ 549 - 577a BGB. The German law differentiates between the rental price at the starting point of the contract and rent increases throughout the duration of the contract. Generally, the rental price at the starting point of the contract is determined by the contractual agreement between the parties. Only in desginated regions with a strained housing market, the rental price at the beginning of the rental agreement are capped by law. Increases in the rental prices throughout the duration of a rental contract are required to follow a \\"rent level\\" (Mietspiegel), which is a database of local reference rent prices. This collects all rent prices of new rental contracts of the past four years, and landlords may only increase prices on their property in line with rents in the same locality. Usury Rents are prohibited altogether, so that any price rises above 20 per cent over three years are unlawful. Tenants may be evicted against their will through a court procedure for a good reason, and in the normal case only with a minimum of three months' notice.BGB §573c Tenants receive unlimited duration of their rental agreement unless the duration is explicitly halted. In practice, landlords have little incentive to change tenants as rental price increases beyond inflation are constrained. During the period of the tenancy, a person's tenancy may only be terminated for very good reasons. A system of rights for the rental property to be maintained by the landlord is designed to ensure quality of housing. Many states, such as Berlin, have a constitutional right to adequate housing, and require buildings to make dwelling spaces of a certain size and ceiling height.  United Kingdom  UK house prices 1975–2006. Rent regulation covered the whole of the UK private sector rental market from 1915 to 1980. However, from the Housing Act 1980, it became the Conservative Party's policy to deregulate and dismantle rent regulation. Regulation for all new tenancies was abolished by the Housing Act 1988, leaving the basic regulatory framework was \\"freedom of contract\\" by the landlord to set any price. Rent regulations survive among a small number of council houses, and often the rates set by local authorities mirror escalating prices in the non-regulated private market.  United States  Rent regulation in the United States is an issue for each state. In 1921, the US Supreme Court case of Block v. Hirsh held by a majority that regulation of rents in the District of Columbia as a temporary emergency measure was constitutional, but shortly afterwards in 1924 in Chastleton Corp v. Sinclair the same law was unanimously struck down by the Supreme Court. After the 1930s New Deal, the Supreme Court ceased to interfere with social and economic legislation, and a number of states adopted rules. In the 1986 case of Fisher v. City of Berkeley, the US Supreme court held that there was no incompatibility between rent control and the Sherman Act. As of 2018, four states (California, New York, New Jersey, and Maryland) and the District of Columbia have localities in which some form of residential rent control is in effect (for normal structures, excluding mobile homes). Thirty-seven states either prohibit or preempt rent control, while nine states allow their cities to enact rent control, but have no cities that have implemented it. For the localities with rent control, it often covers a large percentage of that city's stock of rental units: For example, in some of the largest markets: in New York City in 2011, 45% of rental units were either \\"rent stabilized\\" or \\"rent controlled\\", (these are different legal classifications in NYC) in the District of Columbia in 2014, just over 50% of rental units were rent controlled, in San Francisco, as of 2014, about 75% of all rental units were rent controlled, and in Los Angeles in 2014, 80% of multifamily units were rent controlled. In 2019 Oregon's legislature passed a bill which made the state the first in the nation to adopt a state-wide rent control policy. This new law limits annual rent increases to inflation plus 7 percent, includes vacancy decontrol (market rate between tenancies), exempts new construction for 15 years, and keeps the current state ban on local rent control policies (state level preemption) intact.

Housatonic Township #1, of which Tyringham was a part, was settled in 1739, and was incorporated as Tyringham in 1767. Its original town center is located in Monterey, which separated in 1847. The current town center developed around the first meeting house to be built in the northern section of the township, around 1779. Its precise location is not known, but is believed to be within the bounds of the cemetery; one potential location is indicated by a stone marker. The cemetery is ringed by an iron picket fence donated in 1892 by the Hale family. It contains more than 800 gravestones, dating from 1797 to the present. The earliest stones were generally made for marble, which was quarried from nearby Berkshire County towns, while later monuments were made of granite. An unusually large number of markers (fourteen) are made of \\"white bronze\\", marketed by the Monumental Bronze Company of Bridgeport, Connecticut between 1874 and 1914. Two unusual markers are in the shape of truncated tree trunks, their inscriptions incised on scrolls that appear to be suspended from the top of the marker; perhaps in a contrast to their elaborate nature, they commemorate working-class individuals.

Its morphology is determined by its genes rather than environmental conditions, and it reflects the variable breeding system of the species.Lyons, E. E. and J. Antonovics. (1991). Breeding system evolution in Leavenworthia: breeding system variation and reproductive success in natural populations of Leavenworthia crassa (Cruciferae). American Journal of Botany 78(2), 270-87. Some individuals are self-incompatible and must receive pollen from other plants in order to reproduce, while others can fertilize themselves. Populations of the species have both self-incompatible and self-fertilizing individuals, but some populations are almost entirely selfing.Liu, F., et al. (1999). The effect of mating system differences on nucleotide diversity at the phosphoglucose isomerase locus in the plant genus Leavenworthia. Genetics 151(1), 343-57. Self-incompatible plants have a morphology that encourages pollen transfer: the flowers are large and aromatic and have anthers that are extrorse, facing outward. These plants also have two flower color morphs. Self-compatible plants have smaller, barely scented flowers with introrse, or inward-facing anthers. This annual herb forms a rosette of leaves but usually has no stem. Flowers are borne on long pedicels that emerge from bracts hidden in the leaf rosette. In favorable conditions the plant may later grow a stem with an inflorescence.Liu, N., et al. (2011). Possible contributions of TERMINAL FLOWER 1 to the evolution of rosette flowering in Leavenworthia (Brassicaceae). New Phytologist 189(2), 616-28. The leaves have blades up to 8 centimeters long which have one to eight lobes on each edge, with the largest one at the tip. The margins are smooth or toothed. The pedicels holding the flowers are 4 to 8 centimeters long. The flower has 4 petals, each 1 to 1.4 centimeters long with a notch in the tip. The two petal color morphs are white and yellow, but all the petals have yellow or orange bases. The fruit is a smooth, oblong or somewhat rounded silicle up to about 1.4 centimeters long. The winged seeds are roughly 2 or 3 millimeters long.Leavenworthia crassa. Flora of North America. Ecology Cedar glade Like other species in the small genus Leavenworthia, this plant is adapted to cedar glade habitat. These glades are sunny openings in woods dominated by eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana). They have thin soils over sheets of limestone, with many bare rock and gravel outcroppings. The soils are very wet during the winter and spring and very dry in the summer. The species requires the full sun of this open habitat type and cannot survive in shady areas. Other plants in the habitat include Tennessee milkvetch (Astragalus tennesseensis), Alabama gladecress (Leavenworthia alabamica), Michaux's gladecress (Leavenworthia uniflora), dwarf larkspur (Delphinium tricorne), smooth rockcress (Boechera laevigata), yellow sunnybell (Schoenolirion croceum), and small skullcap (Scutellaria parvula).USFWS. Designation of critical habitat for Physaria globosa (Short's bladderpod), Helianthus verticillatus (whorled sunflower), and Leavenworthia crassa (fleshy-fruit gladecress). Federal Register 78(149), 47060-108. August 2, 2013. Pollinators of the outcrossing plants probably include halictid bees such as Halictus ligatus. Conservation This plant grows at six small sites within a 13-mile radius in Lawrence and Morgan Counties in northern Alabama. Some populations are very small, but in some areas the plant is locally abundant. The total population size was approximately 12,000 individuals in 2009. Most of the occurrences are on privately owned land. One site is in a protected area in William B. Bankhead National Forest. A main threat to the species is the loss and disturbance of its cedar glade habitat. About 50% of the region's cedar glades have been lost since European settlement, and remaining glades are fragmented and altered by grazing, cultivation, and residential development. Many are affected by activity related to roadways, such as herbicides, road construction, grading, trash dumping, and off-road vehicles. Modified glades no longer maintain themselves through the natural processes of drought, wildfire, and erosion, and the openings shrink as woody vegetation closes in. The sunny open spots required by the plant are reduced. The process is hastened by invasive species of plants, especially common privet (Ligustrum vulgare) and bush honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii). The proposal to list the plant as an endangered species was made because it \\"is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range.\\" References Further reading *Beck, J.

It is an active United Reformed Church, and is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History Port Sunlight is a model village that was built for the workers at the soap factory of Lever Brothers, founded by William Lever. Christ Church was built between 1902 and 1904, and was designed by William and Segar Owen. The church was paid for by William Lever. It was opened on 8 June 1904. It was originally build as a non-denominational church with a Wesleyan minister at the time it was erected, but later became a Congregational church (William Lever himself was a Congregationalist.) it is now part of the United Reformed Church. In 1914 the Lever family vault was added as a memorial to the memory of Lady Lever. As a Millennium project in 2000, two new rooms were built into the aisles for the use of children and the youth of the church. Architecture Exterior The church is constructed in red sandstone from Helsby in Cheshire, and has a stone-slate roof. It is in Gothic Revival style. The plan consists of a six-bay nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles with lean-to roofs, a southwest porch, a double north transept, a south transept, a canted chancel, a southeast tower and, at the west end, the Lady Lever Memorial. The windows along the sides of the aisles and clerestory have three lights containing Perpendicular-style tracery. At the corners of the west end are canted projections topped by parapets. The west window has a four-centred head and contains nine lights. The transepts have gabled buttresses surmounted by pinnacles; there is an entrance in the south transept. There are also buttresses on the tower, which has two-light louvred bell openings, a cornice, and a traceried, embattled parapet. The Lady Lever Memorial is in the form of a loggia at the west end of the church. It is in three bays, and is richly decorated, with buttresses, pinnacles, niches, and an embattled parapet. Interior The church can seat 800 people. The arcades are simple, carried on piers without capitals. The furnishings were made by Hatch and Sons, the wood carving being by C. J. Allen, and the stone carving by J. J. Millson. The floor of the church is in black and white Italian marble, the pews, screens and reredos are in English oak, and the roof timbers in Canadian pitch pine. Most of the stained glass is by Heaton, Butler and Bayne. This includes the windows at the east end, which total 16 lights, the west window, and the windows in the south transept. There are also two aisle windows of 1950 by Ervin Bossányi. The four-manual pipe organ was built in 1904 by Henry Willis II of Henry Willis & Sons, and was restored in 2006–07 by the same company. According to the church website it is believed to be the largest extant four-manual Willis II organ still in its original condition and in everyday use. There is a ring of eight bells, all of which were cast in 1904 by Mears and Stainbank. In the Lady Lever Memorial is the chest tomb of Lady Lever, who died in 1913, and of William Lever, who died in 1925. On this are recumbent bronze effigies by Sir W. Goscombe John.

History The Jesuits built the church between 1669 and 1683 following plans by Pietro Francesco Carlone. It was erected near the former Jesuits' College at the south end of the Hauptplatz. The church was originally called the Church of Ignatius (). and was dedicated to Saint Ignatius of Loyola, who founded the Jesuit Order. The Jesuit Order was dissolved in 1773 by Pope Clement XIII. The Diocese of Linz and St. Pölten von Passau was effectively founded in 1783 by a decree of the Emperor Joseph II (1741–90) without advance approval from Rome. The emperor appointed the bishop and designated the former Jesuit church as the cathedral. The diocese was officially established by a papal certificate of 28 January 1785. The first bishop was Ernest Johann Nepomuk, Imperial Count von Herberstein, enthroned on 1 May 1785. He died on 17 March 1788. Joseph Anton Gall was bishop from 1788 to 1807. Bishop Gregorius Thomas Ziegler (1827–52) led an era during which the church was restored. In 1841 Rome confirmed the church as the cathedral of the diocese. Bishop Franz-Josef Rudigier laid the foundation stone of the New Cathedral in 1862. In 1909 the function of cathedral was transferred from the Ignatius church to the new building. The Jesuits returned in 1909. The new cathedral was consecrated on 29 April 1924. Music Ludwig van Beethoven wrote the three Equali for four trombones (\\"Drei Equales\\", WoO 30) for performance in the cathedral on 2 November 1812 (All Souls' Day). Anton Bruckner (1824 - 1896) was organist from 1856 to 1868. During Bruckner's tenure as organist he studied under the contrapuntalist Simon Sechter, and in 1860 became the conductor of the Frohsinn choral society. It was in this period that he flowered into a major composer. On 12 May 1861 the Frohsinn performed Bruckner's seven-part Ave Maria (WAB 6) in the cathedral, a breakthrough composition that became a favorite of the composer. Bruckner's Mass No. 1 was first performed in the old Linz Cathedral on 21 November 1864. Apart from a small solo in the Credo, the original score for the mass did not include the organ. This has been called his first composition as a fully mature composer. The Bruckner Festival is held annually in the church in honor of the composer. Structure The exterior of the church is relatively plain, with two towers on either side of the main door, topped with onion domes. The interior is decorated in lavish Baroque style, with pink marble columns. There are three side chapels on either side of a wide main nave. The church has an elaborately detailed wooden pulpit, and a high altar made by Giovanni Battista Barbarino and Giovanni Battista Colombo that incorporates many statues in marble. Antonio Bellucci (1654–1726) made the painting of Saint Aloysius that is located above the altar. The stalls in the presbytery were carved by local artists, and are decorated with the faces of monsters and dwarfs. The carved choir stalls from the 17th century were transferred from Garsten Abbey. The Baroque organ was built by Franz Xaver Krismann, with alterations requested by Bruckner. The organ has not been modified.

The original county seat, Jonesville, was chosen in 1831. In 1839, the more centrally located Hillsdale began agitating for the seat, and in 1843 the state legislature agreed. A temporary structure was erected as a courthouse on this site; it was soon followed by a by frame structure. That structure burned in 1849, and a new sandstone courthouse was completed by early 1851. By 1887, it was recognized that a new courthouse was necessary. However, voters did not approve the funds necessary until 1898, when $45,000 was allocated for this building. The county hired Claire Allen of Jackson to design the building and Geake and Henry of Fort Wayne, Indiana to construct it. Construction occurred over 1898-99, and the building was dedicated on September 6, 1899. A clock was added to the clock tower in 1909, and was refurbished in 1985.

Macedonia and Adrianople areas, which were given back from Bulgaria to the Ottomans are shown with green frontiers. Bulgarian Millet or Bulgar Millet was an ethno-religious and linguistic community within the Ottoman Empire from the mid-19th to early 20th century. The semi-official term Bulgarian millet, was used by the Sultan for the first time in 1847, and was his tacit consent to a more ethno-linguistic definition of the Bulgarians as a nation. Officially as a separate Millet in 1860 were recognized the Bulgarian Uniates, and then in 1870 the Bulgarian Orthodox Christians (Eksarhhâne-i Millet i Bulgar).Evolutionary Theory and Ethnic Conflict Praeger Series in Political Communication, Patrick James, David Goetze, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001, , pp. 159–160. At that time the classical Ottoman Millet-system began to degrade with the continuous identification of the religious creed with ethnic identity and the term millet was used as a synonym of nation.Nationalist Exclusion and Ethnic Conflict: Shadows of Modernity, Andreas Wimmer, Cambridge University Press, 2002, , pp. 171–172.

Perry, Duke University Press, 1993, , p. 7. The founding of an independent church, along with the revival of Bulgarian language and education, were the crucial factors that strengthened the national consciousness and revolutionary struggle, that led to the creation of an independent nation-state in 1878. History Background All Orthodox Christians, including Bulgarians, in the Ottoman Empire were subordinated to the Patriarchate of Constantinople, which was dominated by Greek Phanariotes by the end of the 19th century. The Orthodox Christians were included into the Rum Millet. Belonging to this Orthodox community grew more important to the common people than their ethnic origins and the Balkan Orthodox people identified themselves simply as Christians. Nevertheless, ethnonymes never disappeared and some form of ethnic identification was preserved as evident from a Sultan's Firman from 1680, which lists the ethnic groups in the Balkan lands as follows: Greeks (Rum), Albanians (Arnaut), Serbs (Sirf), Vlachs (Eflak) and Bulgarians (Bulgar).История на българите. Късно средновековие и Възраждане, том 2, Георги Бакалов, TRUD Publishers, 2004, , стр. 23. (Bg.) During the late 18th century, the Enlightenment in Western Europe provided influence for the initiation of the National awakening of the Bulgarian people. The awakening process met opposition with the rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire in the early 19th century. According to the proponents of Bulgarian national awakening, Bulgarians were oppressed as an ethnic community not only by the Turks, but also by the Greeks. They considered the Greek Patriarchal clergy to be the main oppressor. forced Bulgarians to educate their children in Greek schools and imposed Church services exclusively in Greek in order to Hellenize the Bulgarian population. School and Church struggle During the early nineteenth century, national elites used ethno-linguistic principles to differentiate between \\"Bulgarian\\" and \\"Greek\\" identity into the Rum millet. Bulgarians wanted to create their own schools in a common modern literary standard.Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia Historical Dictionaries of Europe, Dimitar Bechev, Scarecrow Press, 2009, , p. 134. In the Balkans, Bulgarian education stimulated nationalist sentiments in the middle of the 19th century. Most wealthy Bulgarian merchants, sent their children for a secular education, turning some of them into Bulgarian national activists. At that time secular Bulgarian schools were spreading throughout Moesia, Thrace and Macedonia, aided by modern classroom methods. This expanding set of Bulgarian schools began to come into contact with Greek schools setting the stage for nationalist conflict.For more see: Julian Brooks, The Education Race for Macedonia, 1878—1903 in The Journal of Modern Hellenism, Vol 31 (2015) pp. 23–58. By the middle of the century, Bulgarian activists shifted their attention from language to religion and started debate on the establishment of a separate Bulgarian church.From Rum Millet to Greek and Bulgarian Nations: Religious and National Debates in the Borderlands of the Ottoman Empire, 1870–1913, Theodora Dragostinova, Ohio State University, 2011, Columbus, OH. As a consequence, until the 1870s, the focus of the Bulgarian National Revival switched to the struggle for a Bulgarian Church, independent from the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Cultural, administrative and even political independence from the Patriarchate could only be obtained through the establishment of a separate millet or nation. The coordinated actions aimed at the recognition of a separate millet constitute the so-called \\"Church Struggle\\". The actions were carried out by Bulgarian national leaders and supported by the majority of the Slavic population in today Bulgaria, Eastern Serbia, North Macedonia and Northern Greece. Bulgarians often relied on the Ottoman authorities as allies in their confrontations with the Patriarchists. The Sultan Firman of 1847 was the first official document was issued, in which the name Bulgarian millet was mentioned.History of the Literary Cultures of East-Central Europe, Marcel Cornis-Pope, John Neubauer, John Benjamins Publishing, 2004, , p. 403. In 1849 the Sultan granted the Bulgarian millet the right to construct its own church in Istanbul,The Establishment of the Balkan National States, 1804–1920, Charles Jelavich, Barbara Jelavich, University of Washington Press, 1986, , p. 132. The church subsequently hosted the Easter Sunday of 1860 when the autocephalous Bulgarian Exarchate was first de facto proclaimed.A Short History of Modern Bulgaria, R. J. Crampton, CUP Archive, 1987, , p. 16. Recognition of the Bulgarian Millet and Bulgarian schism In the meantime, some Bulgarian leaders tried to negotiate the establishment of a Bulgarian Uniate Church. The movement for union with Rome led to the initial recognition of a separate Bulgarian Catholic Millet by the Sultan in 1860.Bulgaria, Oxford history of modern Europe, R. J. Crampton, Oxford University Press, 2007, , p. 74–77. The Sultan issued a special decree (irade) for that occasion.Anna Krŭsteva, Communities and Identities in Bulgaria, Longo, 1998, , p. 308. Although the movement initially gathered some 60,000 adherents, the subsequent establishment of the Bulgarian Exarchate reduced their number with some 75%. The Bulgarian \\"Church Struggle\\" was resolved finally with a Sultan decree in 1870, which established the Bulgarian Exarchate. Eastern Orthodox Encounters of Identity and Otherness: Values, Self-Reflection, Dialogue, Andrii Krawchuk, Thomas Bremer, Palgrave Macmillan, 2014, , p. 55. The act also instituted the Bulgarian Orthodox Millet – an entity combining the modern notion for a nation with the Ottoman principle of Millet. It also turned the Bulgarian Exarch into both a religious leader and an administrative head of the Millet. The new entity enjoyed internal cultural and administrative autonomy. However, it excluded non-Orthodox Bulgarians and, thus, failed to embrace all representatives of the Bulgarian ethnos. Scholars argue that the millet system was instrumental to transforming the Bulgarian Exarchate into an entity that promoted ethnoreligious nationalism amongst Orthodox Bulgarians. On 11 May 1872 in the Bulgarian St. Stephen Church in Constantinople, which had been closed by the Ecumenical Patriarch's order, the Bulgarian hierarchs, celebrated a liturgy, whereafter the autocephaly of the Bulgarian Church was declared. The decision on the unilateral declaration of autocephaly by the Bulgarian Church was not accepted by the Patriarchate of Constantinople. In this way, the term phyletism was coined at the Holy pan-Orthodox Synod that met in Istanbul on 10 August. The Synod issued an official condemnation of ecclesiastical nationalism, and declared on 18 September the Bulgarian Exarchate schismatic. Independence of Bulgaria Having achieved religious independence, Bulgarian nationalists focused on gaining political independence as well. Two revolutionary movements started to develop in the beginning of the 1870s: the Internal Revolutionary Organisation and the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee. Their armed struggle reached its peak with the April Uprising which broke out in 1876. It resulted in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, and led to the foundation of the third Bulgarian state after the Treaty of San Stefano. The treaty set up a Principality Bulgaria which territory included the wide area between the Danube and the Balkan Mountains, most of today Eastern Serbia, Northern Thrace, parts of Eastern Thrace and nearly all of Macedonia. At that time the clergy's shifts from the Orthodox to the Catholic Church and vice versa were symptomatic of the foreign powers' game that the clergy got involved after the 1878 Berlin Treaty, that partitioned the stipulated territory of the new Principality. Thus, in the interplay between the Orthodox and the Uniat doctrine, Bulgaria supported the Orthodox Exarchate. Russia supported Bulgaria. The Greek Patriarchate of Constantinople supported the Greek national idea. France and the Habsburg Empire supported the Uniats. The Ottoman Empire's attitude was depending on how it had to balance its own interests in the game with the Great Powers. Thrace and Macedonia The ideas of Bulgarian nationalism grew up in significance, following the Congress of Berlin which took back the regions of Macedonia and Southern Thrace, returning them under the control of the Ottoman Empire. Also an autonomous Ottoman province, called Eastern Rumelia was created in Northern Thrace. As a consequence, the Bulgarian nationalist movement proclaimed as its aim the inclusion of most of Macedonia and Thrace under Greater Bulgaria. Eastern Rumelia was annexed to Bulgaria in 1885 through bloodless revolution. During the early 1890s, two pro-Bulgarian revolutionary organizations active in Macedonia and Southern Thrace were founded: the Bulgarian Macedonian- Adrianople Revolutionary Committees and the Supreme Macedonian-Adrianople Committee. The Macedonian Slavs then, were regarded and self-identified predominantly as Macedonian Bulgarians.During the 20th century, Slavo- Macedonian national feeling has shifted. At the beginning of the 20th century, Slavic patriots in Macedonia felt a strong attachment to Macedonia as a multi- ethnic homeland ... Most of these Macedonian Slavs also saw themselves as Bulgarians. By the middle of the 20th. century, however Macedonian patriots began to see Macedonian and Bulgarian loyalties as mutually exclusive. Regional Macedonian nationalism had become ethnic Macedonian nationalism ... This transformation shows that the content of collective loyalties can shift.

In 1903 they participated together with the Thracian Bulgarians in the unsuccessful Ilinden- Preobrazhenie Uprising against the Ottomans in Macedonia and the Adrianople Vilajet. That was followed by series of conflicts between Greeks and Bulgarians into both regions. The tension were result of the different concepts of nationality. The Slavic villages became divided into followers of the Bulgarian national movement and so-called grecomans. The Young Turk Revolution of 1908 restored the Ottoman Parliament, which had been suspended by the Sultan in 1878. After the Revolution armed factions laid down their arms and joined the legal struggle. The Bulgarians founded the Peoples' Federative Party (Bulgarian Section) and the Union of the Bulgarian Constitutional Clubs and participated in Ottoman elections. Soon, the Young Turks turned increasingly Ottomanist and sought to suppress the national aspirations of the various minorities in Macedonia and Thrace. Dissolution The effect of the Balkan Wars in 1912–1913 was the partition of Ottoman empire territories in Europe, which was followed by an anti- Bulgarian campaign in areas of Macedonia and Thrace, that came under Serbian and Greek administration. The Bulgarian churchmen were expelled, the Bulgarian schools were closed and the Bulgarian language was prohibited there.Ivo Banac, \\"The Macedoine\\" in The National Question in Yugoslavia. Origins, History, Politics, pp. 307–328, Cornell University Press, 1984.

In the Adrianople region, that the Ottomans managed to keep, the whole Thracian Bulgarian population was put to ethnic cleansing. As a consequence many Bulgarians fled from the territories of present-day Greece, North Macedonia and European Turkey to what is now Bulgaria. Subsequently, the Ottoman Empire lost virtually all of its possessions in the Balkans, which put a de facto end to the community of the Bulgarian Millet.

Early years  Artimovich was born in Kalinigrad Oblast, the USSR. At the age of 6 months he moved with his parents to Leningrad Oblast, where he lived until the ending of high school. His first experiences in programming were connected to the Basic language on the ZX Spectrum computer.  Saint-Petersburg State University  In 1999, Artimovich entered the Saint-Petersburg State University at the faculty of Applied Mathematics, and moved to live to Saint-Petersburg. In 2004, he finished studying, having defended the thesis and having gained the diploma as \\"Mathematician\\".  Sun Microsystems  From 2004, he worked in the Saint- Petersburg branch of Sun Microsystems, in the development of the C compiler which belonged to a set of development tools of the software named Sun Studio. Artimovich's duties consisted in porting the compiler of language C on the amd64 platform and realizing of functionality of the compiler specific to the operating system Linux. In 2008, Artimovich left Sun Microsystems. Artimovich, in an interview with The New York Times, told that after leaving Sun Microsystems he was engaged in research in the field of information security and computer viruses, and also the development of his own antivirus software for Windows operating systems.

In autumn of 2010, specialists from the anti-virus company ESET conducted research to determine the source of the attack and drew the conclusion that the attack was made with use of the botnet Festi. This cyberattack drew the close attention of Russian intelligence services, and the conclusion was drawn that the founder and the owner of Festi was Artimovich.

The bill was passed by the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background On October 22, 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) made an announcement about how it would apply new regulations from the 2010 Reduction of Lead In Drinking Water Act () to fire hydrants. According to the EPA, \\"Information available to EPA indicates that fire hydrants can be, and are, used in emergency situations to provide drinking water when there are disruptions to the normal operations of the drinking water distribution system. Therefore, as a class, hydrants would not qualify for the exclusion for pipes, fittings and fixtures used exclusively for nonpotable services.\\" The October 22, 2013 announcement \\"came as a total surprise to communities whose inventories of new, uninstalled fire hydrants would be rendered obsolete on January 4.\\" The Community Fire Safety Act of 2013 was introduced in response to this ruling from the EPA. Provisions of the bill The Community Fire Safety Act of 2013 would amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to exempt fire hydrants from certain prohibitions against the use of lead pipes, solder, and flux. The bill would direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to: (1) consult with and seek the advice of the National Drinking Water Advisory Council on potential changes to federal regulations pertaining to lead; and (2) request the Council to consider sources of lead throughout drinking water distribution systems, including through components used to reroute drinking water during distribution system repairs. This exemption that would allow fire hydrants to continue under current previous lead guidelines is similar to the one already provided for shower valves. Toilets and bidets are already exempt as well. Procedural history The Community Fire Safety Act of 2013 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on November 21, 2013, by Rep. Bill Johnson (R-OH) and his co-sponsor Rep. Paul Tonko (D-NY). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce. On December 2, 2013, the House voted to pass the bill under a suspension of the rules in Roll Call Vote 613 384-0. Debate and discussion Supporters of the bill, including Rep. Johnson, argued that the EPA's rule would cause a nationwide shortage of fire hydrants once the new rule went into effect in January. This is due to a lack of existing fire hydrants available for installation that already meet the EPA's rule. Supporters also argued that communities would be stuck with millions of dollars' worth of non-compliant fire hydrants they could not use if the EPA's rule took effect. Adding additional urgency to the situation, winter is when more hydrants are replaced due to damage from freezing or being hit by cars driving on slippery roads. Rep. Bill Johnson referred to the EPA's ruling as \\"absurd\\" and said that \\"it is unconscionable that the EPA has put our public safety at risk because during the hot summer months sometimes, somewhere kids may play in fire hydrant water.\\" Rep Tonko said that \\"when Congress passed the amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act three years ago, I doubt anyone intended to have EPA regulate hydrants.\\" The Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies announced to its members that it supported this bill. The American Water Works Association, Association of California Water Agencies, National Association of Water Companies, and National Rural Water Association also supported this bill. No members of the House of Representatives voted against the bill.

History Early history In 1682, William Penn founded Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, planning it as a city to serve as a port on the Delaware River and as a place for government. Hoping that Philadelphia would become more like an English rural town instead of a city, Penn laid out roads on a grid plan to keep houses and businesses spread far apart, with areas for gardens and orchards. The city's inhabitants did not follow Penn's plans, as they crowded by the Delaware River, the port, and subdivided and resold their lots.Philadelphia: A 300-Year History, pages 7, 14 – 16 Before Penn left Philadelphia for the last time, he issued the Charter of 1701 establishing it as a city. It became an important trading center, poor at first, but with tolerable living conditions by the 1750s. Benjamin Franklin, a leading citizen, helped improve city services and founded new ones, such as fire protection, a library, and one of the American colonies' first hospitals. President George Washington appointed Pierre L'Enfant in 1791 to design the new capital city (later named the City of Washington) under the supervision of three Commissioners, whom Washington had appointed to oversee the planning and development of the federal territory that would later become the District of Columbia. Thomas Jefferson, who worked alongside President Washington in overseeing the plans for the capital, sent L'Enfant a letter outlining his task, which was to provide a drawing of suitable sites for the federal city and the public buildings. Though Jefferson had modest ideas for the Capital, L'Enfant saw the task as far more grandiose, believing he was not only locating the capital, but also devising the city plan and designing the buildings. Dismissed by the Washington D.C. commission, L'Enfant's plan would not be revived and implemented until 1902, as part of the McMillan Commission's efforts to rebuild the city. In 1811, land for New York's Central Park was acquired by the city through eminent domain and incorporated into the urban plan. Residents of Seneca Village, a settlement of free African Americans and German and Irish immigrants located on the future site of Central Park, were evicted by 1857. Frederick Law Olmsted, with the help of Calvert Vaux, developed a design for Central Park, which was entered into the open competition held by the city, and subsequently won. Their plan was then successfully implemented by the city, and was opened to the public in the winter of 1858.  The twentieth century  In 1909, the first National Conference on City Planning was held in Washington D.C. Dominating the conference, Benjamin C. Marshall urged the government to conduct a 'civic census' to study the state of American cities, educate the public on its findings, and establish a national city-planning committee. Daniel Burnham was commissioned by the Chicago Merchants Association to lead a team to plan Chicago's World's Columbian Exposition of 1893. In 1933, the National Planning Board was established. In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson established the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Hamish Hamilton) Transmission is a novel written by British-Indian author Hari Kunzru and published in 2004. It primarily follows the narrative of a naïve Indian programmer, Arjun Mehta, who emigrates to the United States in hopes of making his fortune. When he is laid off by his virus-testing company, he sends out e-mails containing a malignant computer virus in a bid to keep his job, unintentionally causing global havoc. Parallel to Arjun's story is that of Guy Swift, the seemingly well-to-do English CEO of an advertising company, and his struggle to keep his business going as the virus spreads. Transmission was a New York Times Notable Book of the Year in 2005. Plot summary Hari Kunzru uses Arjun Mehta to make his book Transmission a dark but funny novel, using the developing use of 1990-2005 era internet. Arjun is an Indian computer programmer from Silicon Valley. He has this idea that if he goes into America he will be successful automatically and live the American Dream. Moving to America he quickly realizes that this success doesn't come so easily, but indicates to his family that he has succeeded. Arjun was promised work by a slick high tech recruiter but when he reached the States, he was in a waiting house for contract employees and lost his enthusiasm. Throughout the book Arjun faces many problems that interfere with him reaching success, but his main blockage seems to be his naivety. The author utilizes several supporting characters to develop the story from their point of view including Guy Swift; a rich highly successful man, Guy's girlfriend Gaby, Leila Zahir, a top Bollywood star, and Chris: a co-worker of Arjun's. The author portrays the differences between both Arjun and Guy in a particular and exciting way without the characters actually meeting each other. The book has Arjun being the foreign poor individual and Guy Swift being the rich and successful Englishman. Main characters * Arjun Mehta – An IT expert and a fantasist who imagined himself capable of getting a job in America’s top leading company through his expertise in computer technology. Coming from a middle-class family with his father making stable amount of money to support a family of four, he still pushes himself to reach for a delusional extravagant life of America. As a computer expert he already had a live perception of what American life looks like, but the truth that he is blind folded to be that tragedies happen in America too, especially to vulnerable immigrants like him who base their life off a Bollywood movie. * Leela Zahir – A famous actress and dancer is channeled into Bollywood by her mother. Her desperate fans are now joined by global journalists who want to know if she had any connection with the virus infected into computers world- wide. Despite all the attention and glamor she never wants to be noticed and did not enjoy her freedom. Leela sheltered her thoughts by the orders of her mother. It seemed like the innocent dancing sensation of India had something else planned for her after she found out how one of her fans, Arjun Mehta, thinks about her. Arjun Mehta played an immense role in making Leela famous and caused her discomfort by all the attention, but she was able to hear his side of the story which touched her emotionally. * Gabriella Caro – “Money moved her”,Kunzru, Hari. Transmission. New York: Penguin Books, Ltd, 2005. Print. she learned how to adjust to the fast changing environment since the age of sixteen or even earlier. Her parent’s separation was not the only event in her life that forced her to become a refugee to UK, but also her previous relationship with a Brazilian photographer, death of her older sister due to an overdose on drugs, and greed for money. Gaby held an interesting part in the Transmission by connecting to other characters such as Leela who in some way uses her advice. An irresistible figure and a strong personality bring her lot of success and even a relationship with a young millionaire entrepreneur, Guy Swift. When he first sees her at the film fund party he had hoped she would be the one who would become the center of his life, or at least would be located at the center of the several intersecting value circles that he visualized as defining his life. * Guy Swift – Self-centered, young entrepreneur who does a tremendous job in making his company one of the best advertising firms, but has a hard time managing his own personal life. His relation with his girlfriend Gabriella is not very romantic. Their love life has constant ups and downs throughout the book. Guy Swift is shook back into reality once his business is on the verge of sinking. It’s caused by a virus inflected by Arjun. In an attempt not to lose his girlfriend, he tries to express his affection to Gabriella, but she has long lost sincerity and respect for him. Guy Swift is a hard worker and likes to enjoy his wealth, but the happiness doesn’t last too long for him. Themes Globalization and technology Transmission deals with how technology, namely computers and the Internet, are rapidly shrinking the world, and addresses both the positive and negative ramifications of this change. The easy transmission of information allows people like Arjun to be virtually self-taught in programming, but the easy transmission of people allows him to be shipped to America as cheap labour and his skills to be exploited. In an interview, Kunzru summarized the dual nature of globalization as presented in his novel, stating that “barriers are broken and people are coming to understand each other better” but “people like [Arjun] pay a big price”.Pais, Arthur J. \\"The Rediff Interview / Hari Kunzru.\\" \\"Rediff\\". 18 June 2004. Increasing interconnectedness also provides a means for small problems, like one person losing his job, to affect information across the world. The diversity of the main characters' origins, occupations, social statuses, etc. emphasises the breadth of technology's scope. Arjun, a poor virus tester; Guy Swift, an opulent advertising CEO; Gabriella, a shallow token girlfriend; and Leela, an Indian film star, are all affected by the same virus despite their wildly differing circumstances. Neocolonialism Kunzru’s portrayal of an intelligent, skilled young man separated from his family and culture to be essentially sold into corporate slavery in the West implies “a different, but equally lethal, type of empire, that of powerful transnational corporations”.Prono, Luca. \\"Hari Kunzru.\\" British Council. British Council, 2006. Throughout the novel, Western and/or formerly colonial powers continually have the upper hand over minority characters, not only in the case of the Indian immigrants like Arjun who are taken advantage of by the corporation Databodies, but in the mass deportation plan that Guy encounters in Belgium. Although colonialism as a formal system has ended, three people can still forcefully dislocate millions of foreign immigrants as effectively as if colonialism were still intact. Symbolically alluding to its continuing influence in contemporary society is the bust of Leopold II present as Guy outlines his advertising campaign about \\"seamless networking and open borders\\". By juxtaposing neocolonialism and Guy's ideals of an open-bordered global community, Kunzru suggests that, in spite of its benefits, there is a side to globalization that can be compared to the colonialism of the past. Critical reception * \\"\\"Mummy, I'm going to America!\\" Arjun announces early in this deft comedy of global manners and cyber pranks. He might as well have said prison, or be trampled by horses.\\" – Janet Maslin, The New York Times * \\"Transmission has one very good one, Arjun Mehta, a shy young programmer who grows up in stultifying middle-class India and dreams of emigrating to racy America. Anyone who watched the news last night will instantly understand the humor here and feel for poor Arjun from the beginning.\\" – Walter Kim (The New York Times) * \\"Is Transmission, Hari Kunzru's second novel, geek lit? Or is it a subtle, often humorous, analysis of the infantilism that, everywhere, defines the culture we live in? Certainly, its protagonist is a geek. Arjun Mehta, who grew up in the suburbs of New Delhi, is a talented if slightly dysfunctional young man who seems to his parents and sister to be going nowhere, until he appears for an interview with a suave Indian representative of a Californian computer firm, and finds himself with a passport and a visa to America.\\" - Amit Chaudhuri (The Guardian) References 2004 novels Hamish Hamilton books ","title":"Transmission (novel)"},{"id":"41258997","text":"The Bell Buckle Historic District is a National Register-listed historic district in Bell Buckle, Tennessee.

In early November 2000, the band entered the Zenith Recording studio in Lucca to record their début album, A Gate Through the Past, finishing in December. It was released in January 2002 by Tokuma in Japan, followed by the worldwide release via Underground Symphony in June. The album was critically acclaimed. In order to appeal to the international audience Di Matteo, Graziano, Noto and Florio used pseudonyms of Mark Raven, Danny Merthon, Syl Raven and Claus Jorgen respectively. On August 12, the band performed live for the first time at the Agglutination Metal Festival in Chiaromonte. The same year, Holy Knights recorded two cover songs for the planned Heavy Load and Sword tribute albums that were, however, never released. The band became a quartet due to another change in line-up: Florio left, while Madonia was replaced with Simone Campione. Work on the second album began in 2002 already; Di Matteo and Noto built Raven Studio to take care of pre-production. However, the band members eventually decided to concentrate on their other bands (Thy Majestie, Trinakrius and Crimson Wind), effectively putting Holy Knights on hiatus. In 2010, Di Matteo, Noto and Florio agreed to re-unite the band and finish the second album. Recording took place in February - March 2012 at Dabliurec Studio Recording in Palermo. In March, Holy Knights signed a contract with Rubicon Music for a Japanese release, followed by a deal with Scarlet Records in July. Music Stylistically, Holy Knights is evocative of many fellow Italian symphonic power metal bands, often being compared to Rhapsody of Fire. The band frequently employs strong orchestrations and soaring choruses; many songs feature prominent double bass drumming and guitar solos. However, while the début album was strongly influenced by the neoclassical and baroque music, resulting in marked reliance on synthesizers, the follow-up is heavier and contains many progressive elements. Lyrically, there was a progression as well, from the theme of a medieval fantasy to that of an introspection.

Semar temple Dieng temples is the group of 7th and/or eighth century Hindu candi or temple compounds located in Dieng Plateau, near Wonosobo, Central Java, Indonesia. These edifices originate from the Kalingga Kingdom. The plateau is home of eight small Hindu temples that are among the oldest surviving religious structures ever built in Java, and the earliest Hindu temples in Indonesia. The temples show many features of Indian Hindu temple architecture.Michell The real name of the temples, the history and the king responsible for the construction of these temples ware unknown. This is because the scarcity of data and inscription connected to the construction of these temples. The local Javanese population named each temples according to Javanese wayang characters, mostly taken from Mahabharata epic. The Kailasa museum nearby contains many pieces of sculpture removed from the temples. History The Candi Puntadewa The Candi Gatokaca It is unclear when they were built, and were estimated to range from mid 7th century to end of 8th century CE; they are the oldest known standing stone structures in Central Java.Romain, J. (2011). Indian Architecture in the ‘Sanskrit Cosmopolis’: The Temples of the Dieng Plateau. Early Interactions Between South and Southeast Asia: Reflections on Cross-cultural Exchange, 2, pages 299-305Jordaan, R. E. (1999). The Śailendras, the Status of the Kṣatriya Theory, and the Development of Hindu-Javanese Temple Architecture. Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land-en Volkenkunde, 155(2), pages 210-243 They are originally thought to have numbered 400 but only eight remain after local farmers removed stone following the draining of the lake in the 19th century. Examining the Javanese temple architectural styles, archaeologist grouped the Dieng temples within the Northern Central Javanese style, together with Gedong Songo temples, and to some extents also includes the East Javanese Badut temple, and West Javanese Cangkuang and Bojongmenje temple, and suggested that all of these temples are built within the same period, ranges from 7th to 8th century. An inscription discovered near Arjuna temple in Dieng was dated circa 808-809 CE, it was the oldest surviving specimen of old Javanese script, which revealed that the Dieng temple is continuously inhabited from mid 7th to early 9th century. The Dieng temples was rediscovered in 1814 by a visiting British soldier that spotted temples ruin lies in the middle of a lake. At that time the plain surrounding Arjuna cluster was flooded with water and forming small lake. In 1856, Isidore van Kinsbergen led an effort to drain the lake in order to reveal the temples. The Dutch East Indies Government continued the reconstruction project in 1864, followed by further study and photographs taken by Van Kinsbergen. The temples are now believed to have been named after the heroes of the Hindu epic Mahabharata.Wright, A., & Smith, C. (2013). Volcanoes of Indonesia: Creators and Destroyers. Editions Didier Millet. Temple compound The temples are clustered around three groups; Arjuna, Dwarawati and Gatotkaca clusters, while Bima temple was constructed as a separate single temple. Arjuna cluster The main temples compound clustered around the Arjuna temple in the plain surrounded by mountains and hills. Arjuna cluster located in the central area of Dieng plateau, consisting of four temples that lined elongated in north-south direction. Arjuna temple is located at the north end, then successively to the south is the Srikandi, Puntadewa and Sembadra temple. Right in front of Arjuna temple stands Semar temple. The four temples in this cluster are facing west, except for Semar temple that facing east right in the opposite of Arjuna temple. This temple compound is the most intact compared to the other temple group clustered in the Dieng area. * Arjuna temple Compared to other temples, the Arjuna temple is quite intact with complete reconstruction of roof section. Photographs from the 19th century show that the top levels had fallen down. * Semar temple * Srikandi temple * Puntadewa temple * Sembadra temple Gatotkaca cluster Gatotkaca group also consists of five temples; the Gatotkaca, Setyaki, Nakula, Sadewa, and Gareng temples. Today only Gatotkaca temple remain stands, other four temples are fallen into ruin. * Gatotkaca temple Dwarawati cluster Dwarawati group consisted of four temples, namely Dwarawati, Abiyasa, Pandu, and Margasari temple. However, currently only Dwarawati that remain relatively intact, the rest are in ruins. * Dwarawati temple Bima temple Candi Bima temple, Dieng temples, 8th century Bima temple is a single temple situated on a hill separated from the rest of Dieng temples. This temple is the largest and tallest building in the Dieng temple compound. The shape is different from temples in Central Java in general, and the other temples at this site, and relates more closely to Indian temples. In particular it has been compared to the Parashurameshvara Temple (c. 650) in Bhubaneswar, Odisha, and the very different temple at Bhitargaon.Hindu-Buddhist Architecture in Southeast Asia, p. 9, by Daigorō Chihara The 7th-century Laxman Temple at Sirpur is closer. The temple base has a square ground-plan, the facade on each side are slightly protruding out. The front facade protrudes about 1.5 m, serves as a porch before entering the temple's main chamber. Facades on the other three sides forming niches where originally statues or images were stored, currently all niches are empty. The roof of the temple consists of 5 levels, with each level are decreasing in size upward. Each level is decorated with lotus double seam and gavaksha or kudu niches. These are \\"window\\"-shaped arches common as a motif in Hindu temple architecture. Here each contains a head looking out. Such ornaments also can be found in other Javanese temples, such as Kalasan, Gebang and Merak temple. The pinnacle of the roof is missing and its original form is unknown. There are amalaka-type segmented rings at the corners at one level, and the ornament with corbels, leaves and festoons on the lower cornices, below the gavakshas, suggest influence from Chinese Buddhist art. Architecture The temples are small shrines built as monuments to the god- ancestors and dedicated to Shiva. The Hindu shrines are miniature cosmic mountains based on plans in Indian religious texts, although Schoppert suggests that though the plans follow Indian texts, the ornament has \\"design motifs which for the most part have no clear correlate in India\\". In 2011, in a review published by Romain, the temples were related to Dravida and Pallava style temples of South India. The temples all have a single chamber inside, with one entrance, sometimes extended to make a small vestibule. The chambers are raised on plinths, and a cornice outside indicates their height inside. There is (or in some cases was) a high superstructure rising above the chamber, for which a variety of Indian forms are used in different temples. Early North Central Javanese temple architecture is noted for its smaller size, simplicity and relatively lack of ornaments compared to richly decorated and massive temples of Southern Central Java, such as Kalasan, Sewu, and Prambanan. The temples of North Central Java are grouped in irregular clusters, with individual variations of temples styles. This is in contrast to concentric mandala plan of Southern Central Java temples with uniform design of perwara (ancillary) temples. The earliest architectural usage of the Javanese kala demonic masks and makara marine monsters are exhibited along the niches and doorways of the remaining structures. The Dieng structures were small and relatively plain, but stone architecture developed substantially in only a matter of decades resulting in masterpieces such as the Prambanan complex and Borobudur.

The theory that poisonous effusions make it auspicious is now disputed as volcanic activity in this area from 7th to 9th century is yet to established, and records suggest the temple was abandoned after volcanic eruptions became common in central Java.

It is the second live-action film adaptation of the manga, following Lupin III: Strange Psychokinetic Strategy (1974). The film is an origin story that presents its characters in a modernized context, and follows the title character as he forms his thieving gang to steal a Cleopatran necklace while facing opposition from Michael Lee, his rival, and Pramuk, a crime boss. Lupin the 3rd premiered in Japan on August 30, 2014, and made its international premiere at LA EigaFest 2014. Although financially successful, critical and audience opinions of the film were mixed to negative, with criticism frequently focusing on the film's derivative and convoluted narrative. Other areas of the production, such as the cast's delivery of the screenplay's largely English dialogue, were also frequently targeted for criticism. Plot Lupin the 3rd, grandson of the legendary gentleman thief Arsène Lupin, is a member of the international thieves' guild \\"The Works\\", which specializes in stealing valuable objects from wealthy owners. Lupin beats his fellow Works members Fujiko Mine (his would-be lover), Pierre (a computer genius) and Jiro to the theft of an ancient Olympic medal in Singapore, but is forced to surrender it to his rival, Michael Lee, when he threatens to kill him and Fujiko. At a meeting of The Works, Fujiko is hailed as the culprit behind the theft (thanks to her machinations), and Thomas Dawson, the leader of the organization and Lupin's mentor, shows them the most valuable item in The Works' possession - the Crimson Heart of Cleopatra, a necklace commissioned by Mark Antony to symbolize his love for the Queen of the Nile. However, a ruby of Cleopatra's intended to complete the necklace is missing. A trio of thugs led by Michael - Royal, Saber and Maria - steal the necklace and kill Jiro and Dawson, apparently in revenge for \\"Edward Lam\\", resulting in the disbanding of The Works. Devastated by Dawson's murder, Lupin, Fujiko, Pierre and Daisuke Jigen join forces to find Michael and the necklace. Within a year, Lupin and Jigen have established themselves as accomplished thieves, but Jigen grows weary of following Fujiko's false leads. While meeting with her, Lupin is turned in to the police in Thailand. He then meets Interpol Inspector Koichi Zenigata, who informs him that Michael, using the alias Georgio Zhang, is arranging a major auction with Momrachiao Pramuk, the chairman of Navarone Security and a crime lord in secret. Zenigata wants Lupin to 'steal' the items that they intend to sell to each other for the police so that he can arrest them; in exchange, Lupin's criminal record will be erased. Lupin begrudgingly accepts, and enlists Goemon Ishikawa XIII into the gang. Fujiko meets with Michael, who explains that Edward Lam was a member of The Works and a father figure to them both, but after helping Dawson find the Crimson Heart and the accompanying ruby in Egypt, Dawson betrayed and killed him, and Pramuk stole the ruby. Michael intends to buy the ruby to complete the necklace. Lupin, who has been spying on the pair, tells Michael that no matter who wins the auction, he will steal the necklace. At the auction, Michael and Pramuk prepare to sell each other the necklace and the ruby respectively. During the transaction, Pramuk tells Michael that he was a former member of The Works, and killed Lam while trying to kill Dawson. Michael attempts to kill himself and Pramuk before the latter can buy the necklace, but Pramuk reveals that Royal, who (along with Saber and Maria) now works for him, disarmed the explosives. Pramuk buys the ruby for $200 million, and Michael destroys his reward cheque in defeat. Lupin, having listened to Michael and Pramuk's exchange via lip reading technology, calls off the theft to Zenigata's frustration. Disheartened, Michael offers to join Lupin's gang to steal back the Crimson Heart and ruby from the Ark, Pramuk's stronghold, and is accepted. Lupin and Michael enter the Ark disguised as Zengiata and Commander Narong of the Thai Army, and upload a virus into the Ark's networks in the guise of a calling card from Lupin. Jigen, Goemon and Fujiko attack the Ark's main defenses, defeating Royal, Saber and Maria in the process, while Lupin and Michael, aided by Pierre and Joseph (a hacker), along with prior research made by Goemon, penetrate the security defenses protecting the Crimson Heart. Pramuk traps the pair in the vault, intending to suffocate them. Michael places Lupin in the vault's safe and blows the vault door up, killing himself but saving Lupin. Lupin and the others are handed over by Pramuk to Zenigata and Narong, but they instead arrest Pramuk for his crimes, using the Crimson Heart as evidence. Zenigata then discovers too late that the necklace and ruby given to him by Lupin were fakes. Later, Lupin unsuccessfully tries to get Fujiko to wear the Crimson Heart, and Zenigata returns to pursue them. Fujiko takes the necklace and escapes while Lupin and Jigen escape together in their Fiat 500.

Molen, through his production company WhiteLight Entertainment, purchased the live-action film adaptation rights to the Lupin III franchise. Molen noted that the five main characters would be featured in an upcoming film, and that some creative licence would have to be taken to \\"make the story work\\". Monkey Punch, the creator of the original manga, expressed no desire in being involved in the production of the film. A year later, David Ranes and Chet Thomas were named as the film’s screenwriters, and the release date was set as being late spring 2006. This release date was later pushed back to 2009, by which point the film had still not formally entered production. In late 2009, ex-astronaut Buzz Aldrin, along with his then-wife Lois Cannon and daughter Lisa Cannon, sued WhiteLight and Guardian Pictures for breach of contract and fraud, as he had invested $200,000 into the production companies on the pretext that they were using the funds to make films that were never produced, including Lupin III. In 2011, Japanese producer Mataichirō Yamamoto acquired the adaptation rights, and hired Ryuhei Kitamura, with whom he had previously collaborated with on Azumi, to co-write a new screenplay with him and direct the film. Over \\"three or four months\\", the pair extensively studied the franchise by reading the manga and watching the anime adaptations before deciding that their film would not be directly based on any of them, and would serve as a modernized origin story for the Lupin Gang. They also decided that the adaptation would be a heist film, and considered a variety of artefacts that could serve as a unique MacGuffin, such as a \\"cursed diamond from the Smithsonian\\" and an \\"ancient Soviet tank with a giant treasure\\". Kitamura later hired Los Angeles-based journalist Joseph \\"Joey\\" O’Bryan – who he described as his \\"strongest weapon\\" – to co-write the screenplay with him. O’Bryan and Kitamura wrote three separate drafts, which were compiled by Yamamoto into a complete script. Monkey Punch acted as a creative consultant during scripting. In total, the writing process of Kitamura's film took two-and-a-half years. According to Kitamura, creative tensions between himself and Yamamoto were high during development; the director noted that the producer/writer \\"want[ed] to go in all different directions\\", and considered removing the comedic elements of Lupin III from the film. He also expressed that there was difficulty in having Lupin being clearly defined as the film’s protagonist instead of Michael Lee, a character who was created for the film to \\"drive the story\\". Kitamura did, however, express that Yamamoto gave him full creative freedom when filming began. Filming Filming began on October 3, 2013, and included scenes shot in Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and the Philippines, before moving to Thailand for two months. Principal photography concluded on December 26, 2013. Promotion The film's first promotional images of the cast were released on April 9. The first teaser for the film was released online on April 25, 2014, while the full trailer was uploaded on June 25. The full trailer features the theme song, \\"Trick Attack -Theme of Lupin the Third\\", which was written and performed by Tomoyasu Hotei. Release Upon release, the film reached second place at the Japanese box office. It then made its International release at LA EigaFest 2014 on September 15, 2015. It was released in Japan on DVD and Blu-ray on February 18, 2015 with a collector's edition. Madman Entertainment released their Blu-ray and DVD of the film in Australia on 24 June 2015 under their Asian film moniker, Eastern Eye. Reception Critical reception of Lupin the 3rd was generally negative among Japanese and Western film critics, especially following the film’s showing at LA EigaFest. Areas frequently targeted for criticism were the film’s supporting characters, screenplay, cinematography and editing (especially in the action scenes), costume design and soundtrack. The film was also criticized for having most of its dialogue performed in English (resulting in poor delivery and intonation of numerous lines by its Asian cast members), and for overall squandering its potential as an adaptation of Monkey Punch's manga. Oguri, Tamayama, Ayano, Kuroki and Asano were, however, frequently seen as well-cast in their roles. Opinions from Japanese audiences were mixed, with some viewing Lupin the 3rd as “an enjoyable time to be had to the whole family”, while others viewed it as part of a “terrible live-action adaptation trend that has been going on through the years”. Film critic Yuichi Maeda rated the film 3 out of 100 in an online review, writing “The exhibitionism of the movie, ‘Isn’t this action cool?’, ‘Isn’t this pose cool?’, ‘This line’, ‘This costume’, ‘This (etc)’ all feels extremely forced. And more importantly, not one of these things is cool at all. The minute you try to make everything ‘cool,’ everything becomes cheap instead.” Maeda also criticized the film for lacking the franchise’s spirit, stating “[...] Lupin the Third has almost none of the ‘Lupin-ishness’ found in previous pieces [of the franchise]. If you give a big budget to people without any sense, you end up with an outlandish movie. This is a good example of that”. Writing for Kotaku, Richard Eisenbeis described Lupin the 3rd as “both a Terrible Adaptation and a Horrible Film”, criticizing the script’s numerous plot holes (namely the absurdity behind the buy/sell auction between Michael and Pramuk, in which a live studio audience becomes a “room full of witnesses for illegal dealings”), Kitamura’s “nauseating” direction of the action scenes, and the impractical costumes worn by Lupin, Saber and Maria. He also described the film’s soundtrack as “porno music” and disliked the incorporation of Pierre and Joseph as members of Lupin’s gang. Eisenbeis concluded his review by describing Lupin the 3rd as “nothing but a schlock action movie; and while 20 years ago it might have been acceptable among the horde of similar films, that boat has long since set sail”. Matt Schley of Otaku USA called the film “a cookie-cutter, movie-by- committee 2+ hour yawner that fails as both as a Kitamura piece and, crucially, a satisfying live-action Lupin the 3rd film”, panning the costumes, the characters of Michael Lee (and his role as the film’s source of drama and conflict), Pierre and Joseph, the unmemorable music, and the derivative heist film set pieces. Schley also stated that “it's not as if those involved couldn't figure out how to replicate the spirit of Lupin in live action form - it's more like they never even tried”. Paul Bramhall of Cityonfire.com rated the film 3/10, and described it as “a poorly executed retread of the 2012 Korean film The Thieves\\", noting that Kitamura’s film “steals” plot elements and character motivations from Choi Dong-hoon's film more than it does from Monkey Punch's manga. Bramhall criticized the inclusion of Goemon, “for no other reason than he’s obviously also from the manga”, the convoluted and exposition-heavy storyline, and described the action scenes as “the Hallmark Channel versions of the back seat car fight from The Raid 2, the Donnie Yen vs. Wu Jing fight from Sha Po Lang, and the car chase from The Matrix Reloaded”, lamenting that Japan’s need for its mainstream films to be shown on television as holiday specials frequently results in derivative and diluted productions. Planned sequel Ryuhei Kitamura has stated in 2014 that a sequel is in development.

Non-destructive surface geophysical methods are then leveraged to determine the presence of subsurface utilities and to mark their horizontal position on the ground surface. Vacuum excavation techniques are employed to expose and record the precise horizontal and vertical position of the assets. This information is then typically presented in CAD format or a GIS-compatible map. A conflict matrix is also created to evaluate and compare collected utility information with project plans, identify conflicts and propose solutions. The concept of SUE is gaining popularity worldwide as a framework to mitigate costs associated with project redesign and construction delays and to avoid risk and liability that can result from damaged underground utilities.  History  The practice of collecting, recording and managing subsurface data has historically been widely unregulated. In response to this challenge, in 2003, The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) developed standard 38-02: Guideline for the Collection and Depiction of Existing Subsurface Utility Data, which defined the practice of SUE. Many countries followed the U.S. lead by creating similar standards including Malaysia, Canada, Australia, Great Britain and most recently, Ecuador. Developed and refined over the last 20 years, SUE classifies information according to quality levels with an objective to vastly improve data reliability. This provides project owners and engineers with a benchmark to determine the integrity of utility data at the outset of an infrastructure project.  Governing standards  A number of standards for care have been developed to maintain the use of SUE.  ASCE Standard 38-02  In 2003, the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) published Standard 38-02 titled Standard Guideline for the Collection and Depiction of Existing Subsurface Utility Data.Standard 38-02 The standard defined SUE and set guidance for the collection and depiction of subsurface utility information. The ASCE standard presents a system to classify the quality of existing subsurface utility data, in accordance with four quality levels: * Quality Level D. QL-D is the most basic level of information for utility locations. It comes from existing utility records or verbal recollections. QL-D is useful primarily for project planning and route selection activities. * Quality Level C. QL-C involves surveying visible above ground utility facilities (e.g., manholes, valve boxes, etc.) and correlating this information with existing utility records (QL-D information). * Quality Level B. QL-B involves the application of appropriate surface geophysical methods to determine the existence and horizontal position of virtually all subsurface utilities within a project's limits. * Quality Level A. QL-A, also known as \\"daylighting\\", is the highest level of accuracy presently available. It provides information for the precise plan and profile mapping of underground utilities through the actual exposure of underground utilities (usually at a specific point), and also provides the type, size, condition, material and other characteristics of underground features. Exposure is typically achieved through hand digging or Hydro-Vacuuming.Leuderalbert, Ken. “Subsurface Utility Engineering (SUE),” (http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/programadmin/sueindex.cfm), U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highways, Utilities, April 07, 2011  Malaysia Standard Guideline for Underground Utility Mapping  The Standard Guideline for Underground Utility Mapping in Malaysia was launched in 2006 to create, populate and maintain the national underground utility database. This standard addresses issues such as roles of stakeholders and how utility information can be obtained, and was a call to action from the Malaysian government due to increasing demands for improvements on basic infrastructure facilities including utilities. The Standard is similar to ASCE 38-02, using quality levels D-A as its basis. Although it does not classify utility definition, colours or symbols, the Malaysian standard does specify an accuracy ±10 cm for both horizontal and vertical readings. The Standard is supported by the Malaysian government but is not backed by an Association or governing body.Zembillas, Nick. “The Development of Subsurface Utility Engineering Standards,” Global Ambitions, Chartered Institution of Civil Engineering Surveyors, September, 2011  CSA Standard S250  In 2011, the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) released Standard S250 Mapping of Underground Utility Infrastructure. The Standard is described as a collective framework for best practices to map, depict and manage records across Canada. CSA S250 complements and extends ASCE Standard 38-02 by setting out requirements for generating, storing, distributing, and using mapping records to ensure that underground utilities are readily identifiable and locatable. Accuracy levels expand upon ASCE 38-02 Quality Level A, prescribing a finer level of detail to define the positional location of the infrastructure.  Standards Australia Committee AS 5488-2013  In June, 2013, the Standards Australia Committee IT-036 on Subsurface Utility Engineering Information launched Standard 5488-2013 Classification of Subsurface Utility Information to provide utility owners, operators and locators with a framework for the consistent classification of information concerning subsurface utilities. The standard also provides guidance on how subsurface utility information can be obtained and conveyed to users.Davy, Nicholas. “New Australian Standard for underground utilities,” Engineers Australia, June, 2013  British Standards Institute PAS 128  An industry consultation event in January 2012 kicked off the development of a British SUE standard. The first technical draft was reviewed by the committee in December 2012 and it was released for public/general industry review in March 2013. PAS 128 applies to the detection, verification and location of active, abandoned, redundant or unknown underground utilities and associated surface features that facilitate the location and identification of underground utility infrastructure. It sets out the accuracy to which the data is captured for specific purposes, the quality expected of that data and a means by which to assess and indicate the confidence that can be placed in the data.“Draft PAS 128 on underground utility detection, verification and location – call for feedback,” Institution of Civil Engineers, July 1, 2013  Ecuadorian Institute for Standardization NTE INEN 2873  In March, 2015 the Ecuadorian Institute for Standardization (INEN) have published the Standard NTE INEN 2873 for the Detection and Mapping of Utilities and Underground Infrastructure. This Standard establishes procedures for the mapping of utilities for the purposes of reducing the uncertainties created by existing underground utilities. Its systematic use can provide both a means for continual improvement in the reliability, accuracy, and precision of future utility records; and immediate value during project development. It combines two basic concepts. The first concept is the means of classifying the reliability of the existence and location of utilities already installed and hidden in the ground. It is used during project development and is a major component of Subsurface Utility Engineering (SUE). The second concept is how to specify the recording of utilities exposed during their installation or during maintenance/repair operations so that future records are reliable. It is used primarily during utility installation. It is fundamentally a traditional survey and documentation function. Combining these concepts will lead to a continual reduction in the risks created by underground utilities during future projects involving excavation of any kind.SUBSURFACE UTILITY ENGINEERING. DETECTION AND MAPPING OF UTILITIES AND UNDERGROUND INFRASTRUCTURE, NTE INEN 2873, Servicio Ecuatoriano de Normalización, Quito- Ecuador, 2015  Applications  SUE is mainly used at the design stage of a capital works project and when information is being collected for asset management purposes. In both situations, a similar process is followed but the scope of the work and presentation of the information may vary. When a SUE investigation is carried out for a capital works project prior to construction, the objective is generally to collect accurate utility information within the project area to avoid conflict at later stages of the project. For initiatives involving asset management, project owners may be missing information about their underground utilities or have inaccurate data. In this situation a SUE provider would collect the required information and add it to the asset management database, according to the four quality levels prescribed by ASCE Standard 38-02.

The player can also function as a Windows Media 10 and up device when USB mode is set to MTP. Unlike many Samsung players, the R0 features a standard microUSB connector. It also has 9 physical keys (power/hold, back, menu, user button, select, up, down, left, right) but neither hardware hold key nor dedicated volume buttons. The R0 only powers fully off after several hours not being used or when pressing the reset hole. The rest of the time it only switches to a sleep mode. Samsung claims up to 30 hours of music playback (with MP3 128kbit/s files, volume level 15, normal sound mode and display off) and 6 hours of video playback (SVI, brightness 3, volume level 15, normal sound mode).  Software  No additional CD is shipped with the R0 but the optional software EmoDio can be found in the device's internal memory or can be downloaded from the official Samsung website. EmoDio (discontinued, now replaced by Kies) is able to sync one's library with the R0, convert video files, manage playlists, rip CDs etc..

Indeed, only the UCI (User Created Interface: main menu customization) and premium fonts (in Korea only) support have been added via a new firmware. The YP-R0 is infamous for its many bugs, especially the library update one: when adding new files into the internal memory of the player, it automatically updates the media library after disconnecting the device from the computer. It sometimes occurs that due to some specific audio files, the updating process hangs up, leading to brick the R0. It is then no longer recognized by the computer and can no longer start up. Samsung released several firmware updates to fix this bug but never managed to find all root causes. As a result, the issue may occur even with the latest firmware v1.25. A preventive solution is to install a modded firmware or Rockbox (see below). Otherwise the user has to send his device back to the after-sales service center or use the leaked recovery tool.Unbrick the YP-R0 with the recovery tool tutorial on anythingbutipod.com Unlike the older Samsung players which had a specific firmware for every region, on R0 the region code can be changed independently from the firmware (meaning that the firmware is the same worldwide).

Since 2011 the alternative free and open-source firmware Rockbox can be installed on the YP-R0. Unlike most usual Rockbox targets, the YP-R0 port is not a native port. It runs as an application based on the original Linux kernel used by Samsung in the official firmware. That makes the development easier but on the downside, Rockbox boots up slower as on the other usual targets. As of December 2013, the YP-R0 is an unstable port according to the official Rockbox classification.Rockbox home page In fact, it runs well enough for a daily use but cannot be installed via Rockbox Utility yet. The user has to compile the Rockbox bootloader himself or to use a pre- built modded firmware including the Rockbox bootloader such as modded firmware v2.51 (dualboot) or lightROM 4.6 (Rockbox only).Porting Rockbox to YP-R0 thread on anythingbutipod Contrary to the Samsung firmware, Rockbox merges the internal memory and the microSD card into the same tags library, supports more audio codecs and gapless playback among other things.

Gay is the author of The New York Times best-selling essay collection Bad Feminist (2014), as well as the short story collection Ayiti (2011), the novel An Untamed State (2014), the short story collection Difficult Women (2017), and the memoir Hunger (2017). Gay was an assistant professor at Eastern Illinois University for four years before joining Purdue University as an associate professor of English. In 2018, she left Purdue to become a visiting professor at Yale University. Gay is a contributing opinion writer at The New York Times, founder of Tiny Hardcore Press, essays editor for The Rumpus, co-editor of PANK, a nonprofit literary arts collective, and the editor for Gay Mag, which was founded in partnership with Medium. Early life and education Gay was born in Omaha, Nebraska, to parents of Haitian descent. She attended high school at Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire. Gay began her undergraduate studies at Yale University, but dropped out in her junior year to pursue a relationship in Arizona. She completed her undergraduate degree at Vermont College of Norwich University, and also earned an Master's degree with an emphasis in creative writing from the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. Gay was inducted into the Omicron Delta Kappa Circle at Michigan Technological University in 2008, where she would earn her Ph.D. in Rhetoric and Technical Communication in 2010. Her dissertation is titled Subverting the Subject Position: Toward a New Discourse About Students as Writers and Engineering Students as Technical Communicators. Dr. Ann Brady served as her dissertation advisor. Career After completing her Ph.D., Gay began her academic teaching career in 2010 at Eastern Illinois University, where she was assistant professor of English. While at EIU, she was a contributing editor for Bluestem magazine, and she also founded Tiny Hardcore Press. Gay worked at Eastern Illinois University until the end of the 2013–14 academic year. She was an associate professor of creative writing in the Master of Fine Arts program at Purdue University from August 2014 until 2018. Gay announced her departure from Purdue in October 2018, voicing concerns about the fairness of her compensation and noting Purdue had failed to address the issue. For the spring of 2019 Gay was serving as a visiting professor at Yale University. Gay published a short-story collection, Ayiti (2011), then two books in 2014: the novel An Untamed State and the essay collection Bad Feminist (2014), A Time review noted, \\"Gay’s writing is simple and direct, but never cold or sterile. She directly confronts complex issues of identity and privilege, but it’s always accessible and insightful.\\"  Projects   An Untamed State  In 2014, Gay published her debut novel, An Untamed State, which centers around Mireille Duval Jameson, a Haitian-American woman who is kidnapped for ransom. The novel explores the interconnected themes of race, privilege, sexual violence, family, and the immigrant experience. An Untamed State is often referred to as a fairy tale because of its structure and style, especially in reference to the opening sentence, \\"Once upon a time, in a far- off land, I was kidnapped by a gang of fearless yet terrified young men with so much impossible hope beating inside their bodies it burned their very skin and strengthened their will right through their bones,\\" and the author's exploration of the American dream and courtship of Mireille's parents. The Guardian review by Attica Locke calling it \\"a breathtaking debut novel,\\" and The Washington Post crediting it as \\"a smart, searing novel.\\"  Bad Feminist  Gay's collection of essays, Bad Feminist, was released in 2014 to widespread acclaim; it addresses both cultural and political issues, and became a New York Times best-seller. A Time magazine reviewer dubbed Bad Feminist \\"a manual on how to be human,\\" and called Gay the \\"gift that keeps on giving.\\" In a 2014 interview with the magazine, Gay explained her role as a feminist, and how it has influenced her writing: \\"In each of these essays, I’m very much trying to show how feminism influences my life for better or worse. It just shows what it’s like to move through the world as a woman. It’s not even about feminism per se, it’s about humanity and empathy.\\" In The Guardian, critic Kira Cochrane offered a similar assessment, \\"While online discourse is often characterised by extreme, polarised opinions, her writing is distinct for being subtle and discursive, with an ability to see around corners, to recognise other points of view while carefully advancing her own. In print, on Twitter and in person, Gay has the voice of the friend you call first for advice, calm and sane as well as funny, someone who has seen a lot and takes no prisoners.\\" A group of feminist scholars and activists analyzed Gay's Bad Feminist for \\"Short Takes: Provocations on Public Feminism,\\" an initiative of the feminist journal Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society.  World of Wakanda  In July 2016, Gay and poet Yona Harvey were announced as writers for Marvel Comics' World of Wakanda, a spin-off from the company's Black Panther title, making them the first black women to be lead writers for Marvel. Black Panther: World of Wakanda was hailed for its prominent portrayal of LGBTQ characters. The comic followed the journey of two lovers Aneka and Ayo, who are former members of the Dora Milaje, the Black Panther's female security force. The series follows the pair through multiple events, including the siege of their city by Thanos and the flooding of Wakanda by Namor. The series' cancellation was confirmed in June 2017 by Gay, just two days after the premiere of the trailer for the Black Panther movie. The last issue released in March 2017. Marvel stated no official reason for the cancellation; however, feminist tech site The Mary Sue pointed to a connection with Marvel's knock against \\"diversity titles\\" and Marvel VP David Gabriel's statement that \\"people didn’t want any more diversity. They didn’t want female characters out there. That’s what we heard, whether we believe that or not. I don’t know that that’s really true, but that’s what we saw in sales.\\" Difficult Women In 2017, Gay published Difficult Women, a collection of short stories that highlight women who have lives that differ from society’s spectrum of a normal life. Each story follows a different character and her journey through either a traumatic experience or what makes her different from societal norms. Hunger Hunger: A Memoir of (My) Body was released in June 2017.Christian Holub, \\"Roxane Gay announces Difficult Women, delays Hunger\\", Entertainment Weekly, June 17, 2016. Throughout, Gay discusses her experience with weight, body image, and building a positive relationship with food, particularly following her experience as a childhood victim of sexual violence. Gay described the book as a testimony of \\"what it’s like to live in a world that tried to discipline unruly bodies.\\" The memoir received wide acclaim, praised by critics as \\"remarkable... ferociously honest,\\" \\"arresting and candid,\\" and \\"intimate and vulnerable.\\" Following her national book tour in support of Hunger, Gay said she found press around the book \\"to be very challenging, because people just don’t know how to talk about fat.\\" In June 2017, Australian website Mamamia published an interview with Gay, revealing numerous details about how they prepared for her visit, which they described as a \\"logistical nightmare\\" because of the apparent inconsequence of her weight. On Twitter, Gay later described these preparations, including questions like “Will she fit into the office lift?” as both \\"cruel and humiliating\\". In an interview with The New York Times, Gay stated the controversial event was \\"helpful, in that I think people get to see, in real time, what fat-phobia looks like and just how careless people can be in considering that fat people deserve dignity. So I suppose it’s a useful example of why I wrote the book.\\" At a February 2019 speaking event at USC, in the Q&A;, supporters of the Revolutionary Communist Party criticized co-speaker Amanda Nguyen's work in the U.S. government during the War on Terror;http://dailytrojan.com/2019/02/14/visions-and-voices-event-disrupted- by-revcom/ in response, Gay defended Nguyen on Twitter.  Not That Bad  Gay was the editor of the anthology titled Not That Bad: Dispatches from Rape Culture. The collection, published in 2018 by HarperCollins, features essays from Gay and 30 other authors, including actresses Ally Sheedy and Gabrielle Union. Gay Magazine Medium approached Gay in 2017 about the possibility of starting a \\"pop-up\\" magazine for the online publishing platform. The magazine would specialize in cultural criticism and provide pay for writers including Gay's work in an editorial capacity. The weekly online publication was produced with Medium's Deputy Editor Laura June and Managing Editor Kaitlyn Adams. The first issue, published in late April 2019, featured essays by Athena Dixon and Grace Lavery. In May 2019, Gay and Medium formally launched the new publication, \\"Gay Magazine.\\" The short-lived journal was also referred to on Medium as \\"GAY The Magazine--The Best Stories About Culture\\" and \\"Gay Mag.\\" The first of the planned quarterly themed editions appeared in June 2019; public submissions were solicited in addition to the commissioned articles. The final issue of Medium's Gay Magazine was themed 'Power' and was posted on April 3, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic's global lockdowns. In October 2019, asked about \\"Gay Magazine,\\" Gay responded, \\"I’m doing what I always aim to do as an editor, which is to create a literary space for a range of voices who have something smart and interesting to say — and more importantly, to be able to pay them well. One of the biggest challenges of the digital media landscape is that the money is concentrated at the top and it rarely trickles down to the editors and writers, so to be able to have the support of Medium to create a publication — for however long it lasts – where we can pay people equitably and fairly is a really great thing. There is so much good writing going on out there, and I love being able to have a small hand in bringing that into the world.\\"  Unruly Bodies  In April 2018, Gay partnered with the online publishing platform Medium to create a month- long pop-up magazine called Unruly Bodies. The magazine explored the relationship people share with their bodies, through an anthology of essays by 25 writers (including Gay herself). Gay asked the twenty-four writers, \\"What does it mean to live in an unruly body?\\"; her book dealing with such issues, Hunger: A Memoir of (My) Body, had been published in 2017. In a 2018 interview, Gay said, \\"I was surprised because I expected that I might get a lot of repetition, of [subject], not of style, but people wrote about all kinds of things. They wrote about gender, size, gun violence, wrestling, sex, ability. The range of issues from that one prompt, with the way that writers responded, was wonderful, and affirmed that I made very good choices in the writers that I approached.\\" In April 2018, over a year before the actual launch of the online magazine, \\"Gay Magazine\\" posted 25 articles in response to Gay's query under the heading Unruly Bodies; the writers were: Kaveh Akbar, Gabrielle Bellot, S. Bear Bergman, Keah Brown, Meghan Carpentier, Mike Copperman, Jennine Capó Crucet, Kelly Davio, Mensah Demary, Danielle Evans, Roxane Gay, Casey Hannan, Samantha Irby, Randa Jarrar, Kima Jones, Kiese Laymon, Carmen Maria Machado, Terese Mailhot, Mary Anne Mohanraj, Brian Oliu, Tracy Lynne Oliver, Larissa Pham, Matthew Salesses, Chelsea G. Summers and Your Fat Friend.  Other projects  Gay was the editor of The Butter, an online feminist writing site and sister site to The Toast, from November 2014 to August 2015. The Butter featured writing on subjects including disability, literature, family, and music. The Butter ceased publishing in August 2015, with Gay stating she was \\"simply stretched too thin.\\" Gay was a U.S. Guardian columnist from 2015 - 2018. Gay was the guest judge and guest editor of The Masters Review annual fiction anthology in 2017. Gay was featured in a five- minute segment of This American Life on June 17, 2016, talking about her body, and how she is perceived as a fat person. Gay announced in January 2017 that she was pulling her book How to Be Heard, originally set to be published in 2018 by TED Books, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, due to her objections to alt-right journalist Milo Yiannopoulos receiving a book deal from another Simon & Schuster imprint. She also edited the book Girl Crush: Women's Erotic Fantasies. In addition to her regular contributions to Salon and the now- defunct HTMLGiant, her writing has appeared in Best American Mystery Stories 2014, Best American Short Stories 2012, Best Sex Writing 2012, A Public Space, McSweeney’s, Tin House, Oxford American, American Short Fiction, West Branch, Virginia Quarterly Review, NOON, Bookforum, Time, The Los Angeles Times, The Nation and The New York Times Book Review. Gay was featured in the 2016 book In the Company of Women: Inspiration and Advice from over 100 Makers, Artists, and Entrepreneurs. In July 2019, Gay launched a book club on HBO's VICE News Tonight. In 2019, Gay partnered with Tressie McMillan Cottom to create a black feminist podcast titled \\"Hear To Slay,\\" which was set to feature influential black women as guests, including Stacey Abrams, Gabrielle Union, and Ava DuVernay.

Themes  Much of Gay's written work deals with the analysis and deconstruction of feminist and racial issues through the lens of her personal experiences with race, gender identity, and sexuality. Personal life Gay began writing essays as a teenager; her work has been greatly influenced by a sexual assault she experienced at the age of 12 at the hands of her boyfriend and his friends. Gay is openly bisexual, and in a relationship with Debbie Millman. In November 2019, Gay shared news of her engagement to Millman. In August 2020, Gay shared that they had recently eloped.

In 1930, she attempted to become the first female geologist employed by the Geological Survey of Great Britain, but her application was unsuccessful. Early life Hendriks was born in Birmingham, Warwickshire on 3 November 1887, the daughter of Henry and Helena Hendricks. Her father was an estate agent and surveyor. She was privately educated and showed an early interest in geology when she attended public lectures by Charles Lapworth in Birmingham. Geologist Hendriks graduated from the Aberystwyth University in 1919 with a BSc, later completing a PhD at Imperial College London. Between 1926 and 1928 she was temporarily employed by the Geological Survey of Great Britain to assist in the preparation of a catalogue of the Survey's photographs. This work resulted in the publication, in 1928, of Classified Geological Photographs: From the Collection of the Geological Survey of Great Britain. Little is known about her career away from the Geological Survey, but archive material indicates that she found it difficult to find paid work as a geologist. In a letter written in 1941, held in the British Geological Survey Archive, she referred to “the absolute dearth of openings in her main subject”. Despite this, she maintained her geological research, and was elected a Fellow of the Geological Society in 1945. She worked extensively on the geology of Devon and Cornwall, publishing a number of papers up until the 1970s on aspects of geological structure, lithostratigraphy and palaeontology. In 1958 she was awarded the Lyell Fund from the Geological Society given to scientists based on the significance of their published research. In 1965 she was awarded the R H Worth prize by the Geological Society of London, given to reward those who make distinguished contributions to geology as amateurs. Hendriks left an extensive archive of personal and professional material to the British Geological Survey. The Hendriks collection includes geological notebooks, geological diagrams and notes, university certificates, correspondence from the 1890s to the 1970s, testimonials, diaries, photographs and watercolour paintings, including a self-portrait.

History In 1889, a seven-story building rose from the ground that would later become The Empire Hotel. Herbert DuPuy purchased this building in 1908. In 1922, DuPuy decided to tear the original structure down and build a 15-story building. On December 5, 1923, The Empire Hotel opened with its iconic red neon signage reading \\"Hotel Empire\\" erected on the rooftop. Room pricing was vastly in contrast to current numbers. Room rates in 1935: $2.00 per day – a room with private toilet and lavatory for one person; $2.50 per day – a room with private toilet and lavatory for two people; $3.00 per day – a room with private bath for one person; $3.50 per day – a room with private baths for two people; $5.00 per day – suites of parlor, bedroom and bath. Garage service in 1935: garage storage for guest car 50 cents per day, service to and from hotel 25 cents each way. The General Manager in 1935 was Edward B. Bell. In 1938 Patrick J. Murphy was hired as the Resident Manager. The next year Guy P. Seeley was hired as the Resident Manager and Otis H. Culver was hired as Assistant Manager. 1943 brought Daniel H. McCarriagher as the new owner. Transitioning to the 50s, ownership shifted to Leslie L. Paul, who also owned Plymouth Hotel. During this time the hotel was redecorated and there was a construction of a new dining room on the lobby floor as well as an air-conditioned cocktail lounge and coffee shop. The New York hotel was untouched from when it was rebuilt in 1922 until it received a refurbishment in 2007 by interior designers Goodman Charlton. Accommodations The Empire Hotel has 426 guestrooms, including 50 suites. In media The Empire Hotel was featured prominently throughout The CW's teen drama series Gossip Girl, being owned by the character Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick). In January 2010, it was reported that the hotel had seen a five- to 10-percent increase in bookings due to the exposure it gained from the show. A menu with Gossip Girl-themed cocktails was also created. The hotel was also featured in the pilot episode of the Starz crime drama series Power, where Ghost (Omari Hardwick) meets Felipe Lobos (Enrique Murciano). The hotel was also featured in three \\"letter hoisting\\" films in the 70's for Sesame Street.

Having appeared in theatre productions including Wicked and Mamma Mia!, she is best known for starring as Sandy in the 2013–2015 Australian production of Grease. In 2016, Scarlett appeared as Kathy Selden in the 2016/2017 Australian production of Singin' in the Rain which opened at Her Majesty's Theatre, Melbourne.https://michaelcassel.com/shows/australia/singin-in-the-rain/ Early life Born in Rockhampton, Scarlett's parents enrolled her in singing and dancing lessons at the age of four. She later took speech and drama lessons and went on to complete her Trinity and AMEB Classical Voice and Speech/Drama Examinations as well as her RAD and Cecchetti Classical Ballet Examinations. Growing up in central Queensland with her five brothers, Scarlett's family moved to Sydney when she was 15 to attend Newtown High School of the Performing Arts. After attending NSHPA for five weeks, she was offered a scholarship to study full-time classical ballet. She went on to complete her ballet scholarship, but after suffering stress fractures, realised she did not want to concentrate on classical ballet alone, but wanted to sing and act as well. After finishing her senior schooling, Scarlett began studying a Bachelor of Medical Radiation Science in Nuclear Medicine at the University of Sydney. However, during her first year, she chose to audition for the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts (WAAPA). She graduated from WAAPA in 2008 with a Bachelor of Arts (Music Theatre). She received the Finley Award in 2007, and the Leslie Anderson Award for the best overall Showcase Performance and the Hal Leonard Award in 2008. Whilst at WAAPA, Scarlett appeared in several shows and played the leading role of Mrs Johnstone in its 2008 production of Blood Brothers. Career Theatre Scarlett was cast in the 2009 Australian Tour of Breast Wishes, making her professional debut in the role of Sal. Scarlett was then cast in the ensemble in the 10th Anniversary Tour of Mamma Mia!, and understudied the lead roles of Sophie, Ali, and Lisa. She then joined the ensemble cast for the 2010-2012 Australian and international tours, performing the role of the witches' mother and understudying the lead roles of Elphaba and Nessarose. Scarlett felt as though she had become \\"a professional understudy\\". In 2013, after a series of auditions, Scarlett was cast in the lead role of Sandy Dumbrowski in the Australian production of Grease opposite Rob Mills as Danny Zuko. Producer John Frost noted that Scarlett \\"came in and auditioned and she just knocked us away, so this is a great opportunity for her\\". The production opened on 25 August 2013 at the Lyric Theatre, Brisbane, to strong reviews. In December 2013, Australian producer John Frost announced that Grease would extend its Australian tour to include Singapore, Perth and Adelaide in 2014. This will be Scarlett's first return to Perth in a starring lead role. Grease continued its Australian tour to Hobart in September 2014 and will return to Melbourne at The Regent Theatre in December 2014. Scarlett will remain in the lead role of Sandy. Between seasons of Grease, Scarlett was cast as 'Sally' in the world premiere concert of Matthew Lee Robinson's Happy People at Melbourne's Chapel off Chapel on 18 and 19 October, starring alongside Bobby Fox (Jersey Boys), Tom Sharah (That ‘90s Show), Sun Park (Mamma Mia!), Bert LaBonté (The Mountaintop) and Robyn Arthur (The Boy From Oz), with direction by Chris Parker. The show received positive reviews, and Gretel Scarlett was received positively for demonstrating her versatility to what most Australian audiences have been unaware of. One reviewer stated \\"Scarlett as the manically cheerful Sally shows off some fantastic comedic chops, as well as her stunning voice of both range and power\\" and Sun Herald theatre critic, Simon Parris, stated she showed \\"a far deeper level of talent than she is able to demonstrate when performing the simple level of direction she has been given in Grease. Looking absolutely gorgeous as the Barbie-like Sally, Scarlett enhances the character’s Pollyanna outlook with a delicately vulnerable undercurrent. Her performance of “Nice” is nothing short of sensational.\\"http://simonparrismaninchair.com/2014/10/19/happy-people-in- concert-review/ In April 2015, Scarlett was cast in the leading role of Kathy Selden, to play opposite Adam Garcia, in the 2016/2017 Australian touring production of Singin' in the Rain. The show began rehearsals in March 2016, and opened at Her Majesty's Theatre, Melbourne in May 2016. On Sunday 13 December 2015, Scarlett co-hosted and performed at the Sydney Adventist Hospital SAH Carols by Candlelight.http://www.sah.org.au/carols-by-candlelight Singin' In The Rain began its Australian tour, opening to mixed reviews in Melbourne on 14 May 2016. However, Scarlett received outstanding reviews with the Herald Sun stating \\"Scarlett is a triple-threat (singer/dancer/actor) with a bright vocal tone and thrilling vibrato perfectly suited to musical theatre\\" and the Sydney Morning Herald saying \\"everything else about the show is terrific. Opposite Garcia, Gretel Scarlett nails the Debbie Reynolds part, in an attractive and dynamic performance that glides from highlight to highlight, from busting out of a cake in a full Broadway chorus line to the chipper trio Good Mornin'.\\" The show played a full Australian tour of Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and playing its final show in Perth on 21 January 2017. Scarlett was an invited guest artist at 2016 National RSL Centenary Conference opening the proceedings with a rendition of the Australian National Anthem. The event was attended by the Australian Prime Minister Mr. Malcolm Turnbull, The Australian Governor General Sir Peter Cosgrove, Opposition Leader Mr. Bill Shorten & The Lord Mayor of Melbourne & other high profile Australian political dignitaries. A few months after the closing of Singin' In The Rain, Scarlett announced on her official blog and her Instagram that due to health reasons, she was taking a break, and on 12 July 2017 she was embarking on hiking the Pacific Crest Trail, 2,659 mi (4,279 km) Southbound from Canada to Mexico. She completed the hike, reaching the Mexican Border on 24 November 2017.{{Cite weburl=http://www.highwayofmymind.blogspot.com/2017/12/the- gratitude-cafe-part-11-final-chapter.html title= The Gratitude Café Part 11website= highway of my mindaccess-date=2019-03-04} Scarlett then spent time in Canada studying various different acting methods.

In 2013, Kristin Chenoweth unexpectedly invited Scarlett onstage to sing a duet of \\"For Good\\" with her from the musical Wicked. Dubbed by one reviewer as \\"the showpiece of the entire night\\", the performance brought \\"a mid-show standing ovation from the delirious crowd.\\" Scarlett has appeared on Channel 9's Today show as well as Channel 9 Mornings. In June 2013, Scarlett was invited to sing the Australian National Anthem at Brisbane's Suncorp Stadium at game 2 of the 2013 State of Origin series. Scarlett performed at the Sydney Opera House as part of the opening act at the 2013 & 2016 Helpmann Awards and at the 2013 Australian Children's Music Foundation, performing a duet with her Grease co- star Rob Mills.

Description This species can reach a body length of about . It is very variable in colour, from dappled yellow to black. Range It is native to West and North Africa, and may be found from Senegal and Egypt to the lower altitudes of northern Ethiopia. Behaviour It is a major pest of sorghum, where it attacks the grains during the milky stage. It is also a pest on pearl millet and maize, and at times they consume the flowers of cotton and citrus species. Fertile humus and moist light soil in the shade of forest trees or riparian vegetation are potential breeding and hibernating areas for the beetles. They are prone to outbreaks, when they also acquire new breeding areas. Adults form aggregations during the mating period in July, and again in October. They aggregate at their food sources, such as Acacia trees or on sorghum seeds, to feed and mate. During the mating season, males are only attracted to unmated females, which suggests the presence of a female-emitted sex pheromone. Their aggregation behavior consequently appears to be guided by a combination of pheromone and host volatiles. Reproduction A female can oviposition an average of 1.3 eggs per day for a period of 11 days. The eggs generally hatch within 4 to 22 days (mean of 15.7 days) with a mean larval stage of 60 days, and a mean pupal stage of 18 days. The oviposition rate is highest during the first four days after mating, and may continue to the eleventh day. Control Methyl salicylate applied to cotton, or eugenol and isoamyl acetate on rubber septa have been shown to be attractive lures in traps. Beetle traps placed outside the sorghum fields are significantly more effective than those placed inside the fields.

Data and characters are drawn from Wild Cards volumes I-V, including a history of the Wild Cards world, the Wild Card virus, over 50 super- characters, variant historical characters (e.g., Castro, Churchill, Gandhi, Franco, et al.), a description of Jokertown, the major Wild Card organizations, and the various aliens (the Takisians, the Swam, the Network group).

Game statistics and background dossiers are given for the Great and Powerful Turtle, Sewer Jack, and dozens of other memorable characters, along with useful suggestions for creating player-designed mutants. The section discussing actual role-playing is disappointingly skimpy. GMs are pretty much on their own when it comes to creating adventures, and the artwork is adequate at best. Otherwise, this is a terrific effort. Be forewarned that, like the novels, this supplement is not intended for children.\\" John Sullivan reviewed GURPS Wild Cards in Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer #88. Sullivan commented at the end of his review: \\"GURPS Wild Cards successfully addresses [the] ways to run a successful Supers campaign using the world of the Wild Cards. The world flavor is highly described and guidelines for adventures and play are given. For those of you who have been waiting to play in this world, now you can. However, this addresses one other problem with this worldbook; you need TWO other Steve Jackson Games products to play it, GURPS Basic and Supers. This is going to cause some players to take a hard look at Wild Cards; do they want to buy a GURPS worldbook to play a GURPS worldbook? If they want to play Wild Cards, then the answer is a resounding yes! If they are going to be using it as a separate world or a sourcebook for characters only, then the price is a little steep [...]; they would be better off to buy a villains book and an adventure supplement.\\" GURPS Wild Cards was also reviewed in Games Review Vol. 2 #4 Game designer Shannon Appelcline considered GURPS Wild Cards an \\"ironic property\\" since it was a GURPS book based on a series of novels that were originally based on a roleplaying campaign that had been run using Chaosium's Superworld system.

The Polish forces under Marcin Borelowski clashed with troops of the Imperial Russian Army, commanded by Mayor Yakov Ogalin. The battle ended in Russian victory due to overwhelming numerical superiority. On March 22, the Polish unit of Borelowski, which marched southwards from Podlasie, reached Hrubieszow, where it burned a Russian storehouse.

She was married to the notable British geologist Charles Lyell and assisted him in his scientific work. She never became widely known in her own right, although it is believed by historians that she likely made major contributions to her husband's work. Biography Mary Elizabeth Horner was born in London in 1808. She was the eldest of six daughters of Leonard Horner, a professor of geology who taught in England and Germany. Leonard Horner was eager for all his children to be well educated. Mary became a conchologist and geologist while her younger sister Katharine became a botanist. In 1832 she married Charles Lyell (1787-1875), with whom she shared not only her love of geology but also a love of literature and friendship connections in the world of literature. Mary's sister Katherine married Charles Lyell's younger brother, Henry. Career Horner Lyell is most well known for her scientific work in 1854, where she studied her collection of land snails from the Canary Islands. This study was comparable to Charles Darwin's study on birds and tortoises on the Galapagos Islands. Mary and Charles were scientific partners; she accompanied him on field trips and assisted him by sketching geological drawings, packing their clothes, equipment and specimens, cataloguing their collections, learning Spanish and Swedish in addition to her spoken languages of French and German in order to assist with communications, and acting as a scribe when his eyesight failed in later years. Grave of Mary Horner Lyell in Brookwood Cemetery The geologist Roderick Murchison noted her attendance at special meetings of the London Geological Society and it is clear that she had a keen interest and a thorough understanding of geology. She corresponded in writing with Elizabeth Agassiz about the glacial geology of South America. Horner Lyell also corresponded with William Prescott. She was present in her husband's conversations with Charles Darwin, later assisting him by sourcing barnacles, which he acknowledged with a letter in which he also discussed the geology of Scottish glens.

Her research focused on the use of electromagnetic methods to determine the electrical conductivity and structure of the Earth's crust, lithosphere and upper mantle, with a particular focus on the African continent and Scotland. She spent over two decades at the University of Edinburgh School of GeoSciences as a researcher and lecturer and was a Fellow of many societies including the American Geophysical Union and The Royal Society of Edinburgh.  Early years, PhD and time in Africa  Hutton was born in Dundee, Scotland on 22 October 1925, where she attended the Harris Academy. In 1948 she graduated with an MA in mathematics and physics from the University of St Andrews and went on to take up a physics lectureship at the University of Ghana in 1954. During her time in Ghana, she registered for a higher degree and in 1961 was awarded a PhD from London University, which at that time was connected with the University of Ghana. Her thesis was entitled, 'Earth Current Variations in the Equatorial Region' and focused on electromagnetic field fluctuations associated with the equatorial electrojet. Following her PhD Hutton stayed in Africa for 15 years, first moving to Nigeria in 1963, as a senior lecturer in physics at Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, and later gaining an Associate Professorship position in the Department of Physics at the University of Ibadan. During this time, she taught a range of undergraduate physics courses while continuing to develop her research in the field of geomagnetism, publishing 13 papers in scientific journals. This research attracted worldwide attention and Hutton became widely respected in both the geomagnetic and geophysical communities.  Move to Edinburgh and teaching  Hutton's work in Africa was recognised by Professor Alan Cook FRS, who invited her to join the newly established University of Edinburgh School of GeoSciences. In 1969, Rosemary took up a lectureship at the University where she remained for over two decades, being promoted to senior lecturer in 1973, Reader in 1982 and retiring as an Honorary Fellow in 1991. Over the course of her tenure, Rosemary was influential in developing the teaching of undergraduate geophysics within the University of Edinburgh School of GeoSciences and recruited a number of international doctoral and postdoctoral students. The world-renowned research group she founded at Edinburgh, established itself at the cutting edge of instrumentation, method, processing and analysis.  Research and notable projects  Hutton's research focused on several different areas. The electrical conductivity structure of the Earth was her primary field of research and led to the development of state-of-the- art magnetotelluric equipment at Edinburgh, which was subsequently sold internationally. She used these instruments to perform geophysical surveys of geothermal regions and continental rift systems, such as the Kenyan Rift Valley, and used the results to infer the tectonic evolution of these areas. One aspect of her work that Rosemary was especially passionate about was the electrical conductivity and tectonics of Scotland, in particular how an anomalous region of high conductivity referred to as the Eskdalemuir anomaly could be linked to the closure of the Iapetus Ocean and greater regional development. During her time at the University of Edinburgh, Hutton received funding from both national and international research councils to carry out surveys in countries including Italy, Greece, Portugal and Kenya, both for academic and mineral exploratory purposes. Awards and honours In recognition of her significant contribution to geophysics Hutton received several fellowships: Fellow of the Institute of Physics (1965-1980), Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1983), Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society (1970), Honorary Fellow, University of Edinburgh (1991). In 1992, The V. R. S. Hutton Symposium: Electromagnetic Studies of the Continents was held as part of the Assembly of the European Geophysical Society, to honour Hutton's significant contribution to the field.  Later years  Hutton's later years were spent at her home in Peebles. On 1 April 2004, she died at St Andrews Memorial Hospital after a brief illness. In her will, she left £20,000 to University of Edinburgh School of GeoSciences to benefit overseas research students studying geophysics.

It was described as the social center of Albany. Tift hired artists from New York to decorate the hall's walls and ceilings with ornate frescoes. The room was used to host actors, hold dances, stage plays, and was also used for Ku Klux Klan meetings. In 1887, Nelson Tift sold his bridge rights to Dougherty County, which later built a new bridge south of the Bridge House.

Life Royal Circus, Edinburgh Ross was born in Edinburgh, one of the five daughters of William Baird Ross, organist, composer and founder of The Edinburgh Society of Organists (ESO). The family lived at 22 Royal Crescent in Edinburgh's New Town.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1903 After being educated at Edinburgh Ladies' College, Marion Ross studied mathematics and natural philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, receiving prestigious bursaries in mathematics, and graduating with honours. Ross then studied at teacher training college in Cambridge for one year and taught mathematics in a secondary school in Woking, Surrey for two years. In 1928, she took up a post as Assistant Lecturer in the Department of Physics at the University of Edinburgh, and instigated a course in acoustics for music students. In the Second World War she was a rare example of a female scientist working for the Admiralty. Based at Rosyth docks she led a team involved in underwater acoustics and hydrodynamics. Her work with Professor C. G. Barkla resulted in her being awarded a PhD in 1943. For one year, she worked under the direction of William Lawrence Bragg at the University of Manchester, and together with Arnold Beevers, explored the structure of the crystal Beta Alumina. They noted there were 'problem' sites in the areas occupied by mobile sodium ions. Subsequently, the presence of these ions was discovered to make this crystal an efficient superconductor. As a tribute to their discovery, the locations of these ions are now known as Beevers–Ross and anti-Beevers–Ross sites. After the war she returned to the University of Edinburgh as a lecturer, studying high-energy particle spectra. She was the first Director of the University's Fluid Dynamics Unit. Some of her work was published in the journal Nature. In 1951 she became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, two years after the first female Fellows were admitted. Her proposers were Norman Feather, Max Born, Alexander Aitken and Sir Edmund Taylor Whittaker. She was the first female Secretary to the Society (1993/4). Her interest in fluid flows led to Ross setting up a fluid dynamics Unit within the Department of Physics. Many students were attracted to this field of study, supervised by Ross. Ross was elected to University Court for session 1967-68, one of the first non- Professorial members of staff to serve. Her contributions to the University were rewarded with a Readership, and her success was particularly notable given the male-dominated nature of the profession. On her retirement, the annually awarded Marion A S Ross Prize was founded in her name. In 2014 a street at the University's Kings Buildings campus was named in her honour. Personal life Outside her professional life, Ross had a wide range of interests, including literature, art, music, and politics. She was particularly interested in the organ that her father had designed for the Holy Rude Church, Stirling, where he was the organist, and where Ross sang in the choir. Ross died on 3 January 1994. Her obituary describes her as \\"an enthusiast and a person of high ideals and purpose. The type of person who looked for work that needed doing and got on and did it voluntarily. Her research in nuclear and X-ray physics, and in fluid dynamics, is internationally recognised and has inspired others to follow in her footsteps. She will be remembered with affection and gratitude by her students, her colleagues and by her family.\\" Recognition Marion Ross Road, King's Buildings, Edinburgh Marion Ross Road within Edinburgh University's King's Buildings complex is named in her honour.

In early April 1863, Oxinski's unit stationed for a while at a folwark in the village of Kuzniczka, one kilometer from Praszka. Polish insurgents were closely watched by the Russians, and Oxinski was well aware of it, so he decided to march northeast, closer to the Prussian border, to spend Easter there. An insurgent patrol, sent out on April 11, spotted a group of Cossacks, stationed in the village of Strojec. As turned out later, it was a trap, as a large Russian force was hidden in a forest. Oxinski, who at some point sensed the danger, decided to break through Russian lines in their weakest point, and flee to Wielun. The battle took place in a dense forest, and Polish insurgents used bayonets. Using the element of surprise, Oxinski and his men managed to escape encirclement. Poles lost 10 men, while Russian losses amounted to 28 killed. A few days after the skirmish, bodies of 9 unnamed Poles were buried in a mass grave in Praszka.

Biography Crosfield became an active member of the Geologists' Association in 1892, later becoming a council member in 1918. In 1894 she was elected to the British Association for the Advancement of Science. She was one of the first six women to be elected Fellows of the Geological Society of London in 1919, the year that the law enforced the acceptance of women into such societies. She also was a member of the Palaeontological Society from 1907–1932. She collaborated with Gertrude Elles (1872–1960), Ethel Wood (1871–1945), and Ethel Skeat (1869–1939). Crosfield and Skeat investigated the Denbighshire grits and flags from 1906 to 1909 and in 1911, using graptolite to establish a sequence. Crosfield kept meticulous ordered note books and field specimens, some of which are kept at the British Geological Survey in Keyworth, Nottingham. The notebooks not only contain scientific data and observations but also give an insight into a life working in the field. Personal life Margaret Chorley Crosfield grew up in Reigate, Surrey, where she lived until the age of ninety-three. She had a keen interest in education, and served on the Reigate Education Committee for many years. Her obituary praised “her wonderful accuracy and industry” as a geologist, and described her as “always kindly and eager to help”. Crosfield was a promoter of women's suffrage, and lectured local societies on social issues, as well as scientific topics. Indeed, some of her field notes were written on the back of suffragette note paper.  Education  Crosfield attended school at the Mount School, York. Crosfield went to study at Newnham College, Cambridge in 1878, in which she began the study of geology as part of her course. Margret Crosfield had took time off from school as her father was ill and dying. Once he died she helped care for her younger siblings and each inherited $8200. This money helped independently fund Margret’s research and further her studies at Cambridge. With the inherited money, Margaret did not need to work for a living and was able to focus on activities that interested her. She returned to the University 10 years later and gained special permission to study geology exclusively. On her return to Cambridge, she met two of her lifelong friends and fellow researchers, Ethel Gertrude Skeat and Mary Johnston.  Career  Crosfield, Skeat and Johnston went on to survey two areas in Wales, resulting in two published articles. “On the Geology of the Neighbourhood of Carmarthen” in 1896 and “The Silurian Rocks of the Clwydian Range” in 1925. Both articles were published by “The Quarterly Journal of the geological society of London”. In her paper on Carmarthen, Crosfield surveyed four miles around the town and discovered syncline, collecting new species of trilobites. In 1906 along with Skeat and under the direction of Professor John Marr, Crosfield examined the “little-known series of Denbighshire Grits and Flags in the Clwydians, in order to establish a sequence by means of the graptolite fauna”. From 1906 to 1909 and again, in 1911 geological surveys were conducted inside an area of seventy-two squared miles their observations were published in Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society, volumes 52 (1896) and 81 (1925). In 1914 Crosfield also surveyed Wenlock limestone for Proceedings of the Geological Association with M.S Thompson and provided an account for C.E Salmon's publication on Surrey's flora. Crosfield was an esteemed and active member of the Geologists Association, later becoming a council member of said Association. In 1894 Crosfield was elected into the British Association for the Advancement of Science. In 1919, a law was passed for the acceptance of women into public societies, at which time Crosfield became inducted, along with five other women, into the Fellows of the Geological Society of London. From 1907–1932, Crosfield also played a role in the Palaeontological Society as well. Aside from her role as a woman within geological and palaeontological academia at the time, the notes gathered from Crosfield not only hold strictly geological significance. The notes often describe the nuances of living and working in the field, and the notes themselves were written on the back of suffragette paper; denoting her active role in the suffragette movement. Margaret Crosfield was able to self-fund her research due to the inheritance of her fathers wealth, and was not employed by a University or Collegehttps://blog.geolsoc.org.uk/2019/06/18/100-years-of- female-fellows-margaret-crosfield/.  Contribution to Geology  Crosfield published three research papers. The first was written with Ethel Skeat on the geology of Carmarthen in 1896. The paper was clear and formed the basis of the geological map produced by the British Geological Survey for the area. Her second publication was with Mary Johnston, on the Wenlock limestone of Shropshire. Finally, she wrote again with Ethel Skeat in 1925 on the geology of the Silurian rocks of the Clywdian Range. Alongside her publications, she travelled widely and kept detailed notes. These notes contained field notes, and records of specimen locations still seen in British Geological Survey in Key Worth and the Grosvenor Museum in Chester. In 1906 Professors McKenny Hughes, and Marr of the University of Cambridge along with Professor Lapworth of Mason Science College initiated a small group of woman including Margaret Crosfield and Ethel Skeat to research the Silurian and Ordovician rock of North Wales and the borders to solve the \\"Silurian problem.\\" Unfortunately, the research of developing and understanding the Silurian and Ordovician stratigraphy of Northeast Wales is lost over time. Margaret surveyed a four- mile radius around Carmarthen and while examining the syncline she discovered new features of stratigraphy and also collected a new species of trilobite. She was one of the first six women to be elected as fellows of the Geological Society. Her contribution to Geology was one that paved way for many women in Geology. Her information and readings are still preserved to this day and are used to collect old findings.
