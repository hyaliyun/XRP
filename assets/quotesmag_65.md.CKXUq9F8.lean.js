Personal life  Born Blanche Ames in Lowell, Massachusetts, Ames was the daughter of Civil War General and Mississippi Governor Adelbert Ames and Blanche Butler Ames. The fourth of six children, she was the sister of Adelbert Ames Jr., a prominent scientist. She was also granddaughter to Civil War General and Massachusetts Governor Benjamin Butler and actress Sarah Hildreth Butler. Ames attended the Rogers Hall School in Lowell.Summary, Ames Family Papers, 1812-2008, Sophia Smith Collection, Five College Archives and Manuscript Collections. She was later one of few women of her time to attend college, earning a B.A. in Art History and a diploma in Studio Art from Smith College in 1899. She was the president of her graduating class. In 1900 she married Harvard University botany professor Oakes Ames (no relation) and took the married name Blanche Ames Ames. The Ameses had four children: Pauline (born 1901), Oliver (born 1903), Amyas (born 1906), and Evelyn (born 1910).Mass. Dept. of Conservation and Recreation, \\"Blanche Ames Ames\\" (last visited 2010/05/04. Later in her life, Ames wrote a biography about her father, \\"Adelbert Ames, 1835-1933; General, Senator, Governor, the story of his life and times and his integrity as a soldier and statesman in the service of the United States of America throughout the Civil War and in Mississippi in the years of Reconstruction\\" (1964). Ames' daughter, Pauline, grew up to write many books about her family, including \\"Oakes Ames, Jottings of a Harvard Botanist\\" (1979), and \\"The Plimpton Papers, Law and Diplomacy\\" (1985). One of Ames' grandchildren was George Ames Plimpton, famed sportswriter. Ames is buried in the Hildreth Family Cemetery in Lowell. The Oakes Ames estate is now Borderland State Park The Ames estate in North Easton, Massachusetts, called Borderland, was designed by Ames herself in the early 1900s. It is now Borderland State Park.  As an artist  Ames was a talented artist in a variety of media. Her work included portraiture, primarily done in oil paint, botanical illustration, and political cartoons. Though introduced to art through her mother Blanche Ames‚Äôs lifelong interest in painting, Blanche Ames Ames first became seriously interested in practicing art as a college student. Praised by her professors and classmates, she began to envision her life as an artist. Through her persistence, and with the encouragement her husband Oakes (who gifted her with an extravagant set of books on famous artists while courting her) this vision became reality. Beyond the knowledge of art history she gained at Smith, Ames was well aware of artists of her own time. In Boston, she sat for a portrait by prominent American Impressionist Edmund C. Tarbell in 1906. She attended the armory show of modern art in New York City in 1913. Though not a part of the circle of women producing suffrage cartoons in New York, who were connected through Heterodoxy and other organizations, she kept close watch on their work and other efforts toward suffrage in both England and America, hiring a newspaper clipping service to save suffrage news from 1915 to 1916. In 1902, she began illustrating Oakes Ames's botanical publications, including his seven volume treatise on orchids, which is still considered one of the best researched to this day. Previously he had illustrated the orchids himself with watercolor. Blanche Ames Ames first used watercolors for the orchid illustrations, but later switched to copperplate etching. She also published detailed pen and ink drawings of the orchids. The illustrations were drawn from dried plant specimens observed through a camera lucida. Blanche Ames Ames continued to illustrate orchids throughout their life together, eventually designing the decorations which now appear at both of their graves. During the 1910s Blanche Ames Ames produced a number of political cartoons promoting women‚Äôs suffrage, which appeared in publications including Woman‚Äôs Journal, and the Boston American. In 1915 she became the art editor of Woman‚Äôs Journal, which had relocated its headquarters from New York to nearby Boston three years prior. Ames's etchings are on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and her oil painting can be seen at Harvard, Dartmouth, and Columbia University.  Women's Rights Work  Ames held a lifelong passion for women's rights. In 1915, when Massachusetts voters would decide whether to allow women the right to vote, Blanche attended 40 events throughout the commonwealth to spread the word of female equality. She was president of the Easton Woman Suffrage League and from 1915 to 1918 she was Treasurer of the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage League. In 1916 she helped found the Birth Control League of Massachusetts, an affiliate of Margaret Sanger's group, the American Birth Control League, and served as first President. In this role Ames helped to form The Doctors Bill to Clarify the Law, which regulated the ability of doctors to provide birth control counseling to married women with health problems, and later helped establish universal access to birth control. Massachusetts did not legalize contraception for married women until 1966, the last state in the nation to do so, and Ames set the standard for perseverance in the decades-long effort. In 1941 Ames also served as a board member and later as President of the New England Hospital for Women and Children in Boston. NEH was managed by women serving purposely only women and children. They intended to give medical care services to the same sex . In 1952 because of financial circumstances they opened up to the possibility of employing male staff. Ames fought to keep the hospital as only female staff and administration through funding methods.  Inventions  Ames held patents for inventions which included a hexagonal lumber cutter and a method for entrapping enemy aircraft. During World War II, Ames came across the realization that thread could snarl and jam a sewing machine motor, Blanche then used that same principle to design a device to ensnare low-flying aircraft. The machine was demonstrated on the lawn at Borderland for guests from the Pentagon. Although it was accepted by the U.S. Army, it came too late for it to be applied in war.  The Ames Color System  In the early 1910s Ames' brother, Adelbert Ames, Jr., a scientist particularly interested in vision, moved into her studio for painting lessons. With her brother Ames began to develop a color notation system more extensive than the Munsell color system. Together the two created coded color swatches which corresponded to particular tubes of paint. The artist would use these swatches to select the most realistic colors and the codes would be mapped out on a drawing before the paint was applied. Blanche Ames Ames first put this system to use in a painting in 1912. She continued to use this color notation after her collaboration with her brother had concluded.

His practice began as a \\"builder\\" in Brooklyn in the 1820s:Mary M. Thacher, \\"The stately homes of Lambert's Cove\\" Historical Footnotes: Bulletin of the Stonington Historical Society (February 2001) (On-line text ) notes that in Spooner's 1824 Brooklyn directory, Gamaliel King, \\"builder\\", was listed among \\"building trades\\" at 11 Middagh Place. He was also at the time \\"Assessor of the village [of Brooklyn], Fireman No. 2 Engine Fire Department, and Trustee of the Firemen.\\" in 1823 he and Joseph Moser were commissioned to build the York Methodist Episcopal Church, which was dedicated 6 June 1824. The following year, he was at Pineapple Street, corner of Hicks, and \\"Trustee of the Apprentices Library Association.\\" In 1826, he was at Orange Street, listed as a builder, but in subsequent years supplementing his income as a grocer.Thacher 2001. None of his early work can be identified today, if any of his structures still stand. He was known for his pioneering commercial architecture in Manhattan through his partnership with John Kellum, a carpenter of Hempstead, Long Island, who became a distinguished architect in his own right. The partnership of King & Kellum practiced in Brooklyn from 1846 to 1859, mostly from Fulton Street;They also had offices in Manhattan at 179 Broadway, noted 1855 to 1859 by Thacher 2001. in New York they designed the landmark Cary Building (1857), which runs through the block between Chambers Street and Reade Street, with two fa√ßades that placed William H. Cary's dry-goods shop and warehouse among the first fully cast iron-fronted buildings in the world.For a pioneer in this construction, see James Bogardus.; Christopher Gray noted how the widening of Church Street in the 1920s has exposed to the public gaze the Cary Building's long side wall of utilitarian brick, never meant to be seen. (Christopher Gray, \\" Streetscapes/The 1857 Cast-Iron Cary Building, at 105 Chambers Street; Facades Meant to Be Seen, a Brick Wall That Wasn't\\", The New York Times 16 July 2000 The two ground-floor fronts are of large-paned windows and doors framed in slender cast-iron columns; paired columns separate the arcaded window bays of upper floors, with cast-iron rustication that was originally painted a creamy limestone color and the wet paint surfaces sanded the better to imitate stone. The effect was akin to a narrow slice of Venetian Renaissance palazzo. Cary had already commissioned from King & Kellum cast-iron storefronts on Fulton Street in Brooklyn and on Pearl Street in Manhattan; the cast-iron elements were produced by Daniel D. Badger's Architectural Iron Works in Manhattan.Gray 2000. With Kellum as foreman King built the Brooklyn City Hall, which was begun in 1845 to King's simplified design on foundations that had been laid in preparation for a more ambitious design, which has been aborted in the financial crisis of the Panic of 1837. In the original competition in 1835 King's design had come in second. The incomplete City Hall opened in 1848, before it was fully completed, and served as city hall for nearly fifty years; since consolidation with New York City in 1898, it has been the Brooklyn Borough Hall.Brooklyn Borough Hall In New York King and Kellum built the simple Italianate Friends' Meeting House (1859), on Gramercy Park South, once reputedly a stop on the Underground Railroad and now housing the Brotherhood Synagogue. The Gothic Revival Washington Square United Methodist Church that was built in 1860 and designed by Gamaliel King, according to the AIA Guide to New York City, was stripped of its remaining interiors and turned into condominiums in 2006.\\"Interior demolition proceeding at condo conversion of church in Village\\" 16 February 2006.. In Brooklyn King designed some of the city's finest churches, exemplified today by the 12th Street Dutch Reformed Church, Park Slope (1868)Others, like the carpenter's Gothic Church of St. Matthew's Episcopal, on Throop Avenue and Pulaski Street (1861), have disappeared. and the once-spectacular domed King's County Courthouse (1861-5, demolished).\\"The exuberantly colonnaded, domed, pedimented, balustraded and rusticated Kings County Courthouse\\", according to Francis Morrone, An Architectural Guidebook to Brooklyn, 2001, ch. \\"Lost Brooklyn\\". Later, in partnership with William H. Willcox he built the Kings County Savings Bank in Williamsburgh, Brooklyn (completed 1868, standing). Captain Nathaniel B. Palmer house on Pine Point, Stonington, Connecticut The disappearance of his office archive means that there is no way to assess the scope of his work for private clients. Mary M. Thacher surmises that three houses built round Lambert's Cove, Stonington, Connecticut, are the only documented houses attributed to King still standing today. The house of James Ingersoll Day was demolished following the Hurricane of 1938 but the Captain Nathaniel B. Palmer house on Pine Point, and the Stanton house, \\"Linden Hall\\"Built for the brothers J.W. and Charles Stanton. remain. It is also likely that the undocumented Cove Lawn built in 1856 by the youngest of three Palmer brothers, Captain Theodore Dwight Palmer, was also designed by Gamaliel King. The Italianate King-Jellison House (1868), 330 Engle Street, Tenafly, New Jersey, built for George B. Jellison, a printer in New York City, who married Sarah King,George Burbank Jellison (1831-1891); a piece of lumber found in restoring the house bears the signatures of all three, according to the present owners (Bergen County Historical Society Newsletter Winter 2007:7). is attributed to King.T.

In addition to his career as architect, Gamaliel King was a member of the New York State Assembly (Kings Co.) in 1846. Gamaliel King's parents were Abraham King and Bethia Parshall King of Shelter Island. On 19 June 1819, he married Catherine Oliver Snow, daughter of John Snow and Catherine Oliver Snow of Brooklyn; with her had five children, four of whom lived to adulthood.

It is one of the most common diseases in the wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) population. Turkeypox, like all avipoxviruses, is transmitted either through skin contact or by arthropods (typically mosquitos) acting as mechanical vectors. Turkeypox virus was first reported in a turkey flock in New York by E.L. Burnett, and may be identified by nodular proliferative skin lesions on the non-feathered parts of the body and in the fibrino-necrotic and proliferative lesions in the mucous membrane of the upper respiratory tract.  Viral classification  Turkeypox virus is a member of the family Poxviridae and is in the genus Avipoxvirus. There are currently 9 other species within this genus: Fowlpox virus, Juncopox virus, Mynahpox virus, Psittacinepox virus, Sparrowpox virus, Starlingpox virus, Pigeonpox virus, Canarypox virus and Quailpox virus. Avipoxvirus infections have been reported in over 232 bird species in 23 orders of birds, but most of our knowledge comes from the study of fowlpox virus and canarypox virus as they are the only species with full genome sequences available.  Structure & Genome  Turkeypox virus, like other Avipoxviruses, is an enveloped, double- stranded DNA virus with a large, linear genome of approximately 300kb in size. The central region of the genome contains 90-100+ homologous genes that are involved in viral replication, and these genes are generally relatively conserved among Poxviruses. This is in contrast to the more variable, terminally located genes that have been shown to encode a diverse array of proteins involved in host range restriction.  Replication  Avipoxviruses follow the same replication cycle that all poxviruses use. Poxvirus is unique from other DNA viruses in respect to its locale of replication in the cell. Poxvirus replicates in the cytoplasm instead of the nucleus. This phenomenon is made possible by the fact that poxvirus encodes its own transcriptional machinery, so poxvirus uses only the host translational machinery to produce its mature virions.  Entry and Initial Uncoating  Poxvirus starts its replication cycle by attaching to host cell receptors. These receptors are thought to be glycosaminoglycan. Once attached the virus uncoats by first losing its outer membrane and then fusing with the cellular membrane so that its core particle containing the genome can be released into the cytoplasm.  Early Transcription  Once in the cytoplasm poxvirus then starts to express early genes. These early genes are expressions are mediated by virally encoded transcriptional machinery that includes: a heterodimeric transcription factor (vETF), a seven-subunit RNA polymerase, the heterodimeric capping enzyme/ termination protein, and the heterodimeric poly(A) polymerase. Also important for transcription is a capsidated RNA helicase, and two NTPases. These early transcripts are released from the core and translated by host ribosomes. = Translocation = The viral core is now translocated to the outside of the cell nucleus. = Second Uncoating = After these early genes are transcribed and translated there is a second Uncoating step in which the rest of the genome is released and exposed to the previously produced replications proteins. The viral genome is now replicated as concatamers and transcription and translation of intermediate genes (mainly coding for transcription factors) occurs. = Late Transcription = Late viral genes are now being transcribed (most encode for structural proteins, enzymes and transcriptions factors) and are then translated. = Assembly and Release = The concatameric intermediates produced earlier are now resolved into double strand DNA and packaged in the late viral proteins to produce and immature virions (IV). The immature virions mature through an unknown mechanism that may involve processing by the Golgi apparatus in the cell. They are now mature virions that are release from the cell by either lysing the cell or budding out from the membrane. It is through budding that they acquire their envelope.  Tropism  Avipoxviruses like all viruses is an obligate intracellular parasite. It uses host translational machinery to replicate its genome. Avipoxviruses only infect birds, particularly wild fowl, and in this case wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo). Avipoxviruses are not able to complete their replication in non ‚Äì avian species. Transmission of avipoxvirus occurs through a mosquito vector.

The Indian Head River was an important fishing and water pathway for the Massachuset Indian village of Mattakeeset which was located around the Pembroke Ponds. History Several significant historic mills, factories, and dams were built along the Indian Head River. A dam at the crossing of the Indian Head River and State Street in Hanson marks the former site of Ezra Phillips & Sons Tack Factory. In 1812, James Reed constructed a gristmill on the Hanson side of the river at its intersection with Rocky Run Brook, then built a dam across the Indian Head River for a tack and nail factory. Immediately east of this site, the tack works of R. C.

Clapp Rubber Company at Luddam's Ford Park still pollute the Indian Head River bed, making it unsafe to drink the water and eat the fish. The series of historic dams along the Indian Head River have prevented fish from easily swimming upstream. However, a fish ladder was constructed at Luddam's Ford Park. For two weeks during the summer, the herring run up stream to spawn. If herring are caught they must be released and no motor boats are allowed. The river is stocked with trout. It also has a small beaver (Castor canadensis) population.

He developed the foundations of Kazakh grammar, and helped create the current form of the Cyrillic Kazakh alphabet. Amanzholov also helped to create Russian-Kazakh military and agricultural dictionaries. Early life and career Amanzholov was born in the village (aul) of Eginsu in East Kazakhstan Province. In 1916 he graduated from the Kanton-Karagae Russian-Kazakh school and enrolled in a real school in Ust-Kamenogorsk, but was forced to drop out due to financial difficulties. He later enrolled in a three-month course of study in Semipalatinsk, after which he returned to his home village to work as a teacher. In 1924 he was offered a job as a high-ranking secretary in the executive committee of East Kazakhstan province. In 1926 he moved to Tashkent to work at the Central Asian State University in the department of Kazakh language and literature. In the fall of 1931 Amanzholov began to teach at the Abay Kazakh Pedagogical Institute. The next year he became an associate professor. He would continue to work at this institution until his death nearly 30 years later. Grammar and alphabet In the early 1930s he began a program for creating Kazakh textbooks. In 1932 Amanzholov published the grade school textbook Kazakh Grammar (). That year he also edited a Kazakh language textbook for younger children. From 1934-1940 he wrote a grammar textbook for middle school students. On November 10, 1940, at the 5th session of the Supreme Soviet of the Kazakh SSR, Amanzholov was presented with the project of creating a new Cyrillic alphabet for the Kazakh language. This alphabet would replace the Uniform Turkic Alphabet which was currently being used throughout the USSR. Military service From February 1942 to June 1946 Amanzholov was placed on active war service in the Red Army. During that time he directed propaganda activities among soldiers of non-Russian origin, and published Notebook of a Red Army Propagandist (–ë–ª–æ–∫–Ω–æ—Ç –∞–≥–∏—Ç–∞—Ç–æ—Ä–∞ –ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–π –ê—Ä–º–∏–∏) as well as leaflets about Heroes of the Soviet Union.

She was a key figure in the study of Aboriginal history in Canada's academic world.  Personal life  Dickason was born on 6 March 1920 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, to parents Frank Leonard Williamson and Phoebe Philomena C√¥t√©. Her family moved to the Interlake region after losing everything they owned during the Great Depression. Aged 12, she, her sister Alice, and her mother Phoebe went trapping and fishing to provide food for the family. \\"Living in the bush as I did during my adolescent years, I very soon learned that survival depended upon assessing each situation as it arose, which calls for common sense and realism\\", said Olive. \\"You neither give up nor play games.\\" Encouraged by her mentor, the priest Athol Murray, she decided to finish high school in Saskatchewan, prior to pursuing post- secondary education. She completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in French and philosophy at Notre Dame College, an affiliate of the University of Ottawa. She first became aware of her M√©tis ancestry as a young adult upon meeting some M√©tis relatives in Regina. Dickason had three daughters: Anne, Clare, and Roberta. Olive Dickason died on 12 March 2011, one week after her 91st birthday.  Career  She began a 24-year career in journalism at the Regina Leader-Post and subsequently, worked as a writer and editor at the Winnipeg Free Press, the Montreal Gazette, and The Globe and Mail. She promoted coverage of First Nations and women's issues. In 1970, aged 50, she entered the graduate program at the University of Ottawa. She had to struggle with faculty preconceptions regarding Aboriginal history ‚Äì including arguments that it did not exist ‚Äì before finally finding a professor, Cornelius Jaenen, to act as her academic advisor. \\"I was lucky ... [a] Belgian fellow, who didn't know much about Native people, but knew a lot about discrimination, took up my cause, and the university eventually admitted me.\\" She completed her master's degree at the University of Ottawa with the thesis Louisburg and the Indians: A Study in Imperial Race Relations, 1713‚Äì1760 two years later, and her PhD in 1977. Her doctoral thesis, entitled The Myth of the Savage, was eventually published as were Canada's First Nations: A History of Founding Peoples from the Earliest Times and The Native Imprint: The Contribution of First Peoples to Canada's Character -- Volume 1: to 1815 (1995), which she edited. In addition she also wrote Indian Arts in Canada, which won three awards for conception and design and coauthored The Law of Nations and the New World. Dickason taught at the University of Alberta from 1976 to 1992. She retired from this professorship when she was 72, after fighting the mandatory retirement at age 65. Dickason filed a complaint with the Alberta Human Rights Commission against the University of Alberta, claiming its mandatory retirement policy was a violation of the Alberta Individual's Rights Protections Act.Dickason v. University of Alberta, [1992 2 SCR 1103.] Dickason won her case in the human rights board of inquiry and the Alberta Queen's Bench, but lost in the Alberta Court of Appeal and then in the Supreme Court of Canada, the latter by a 4‚Äì3 split among the judges. Her time as a professor and her significant contributions to the literature of history in Canada have influenced a whole generation of scholars, and will continue to be the basis for much historical work done in the future.  Awards  Olive was awarded the Order of Canada in 1996, and was the recipient of the Aboriginal Achievement Award, now the Indspire Awards, in 1997. She has also been the recipient of numerous honorary doctorates throughout the years.

The term is used in Canada for those who settled in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. They were the most numerous of the African Americans who sought freedom during the War of 1812. The Black Refugees were the second group of African Americans, after the Black Loyalists, to flee American enslavement in wartime and settle in Canada. They make up the most significant single immigration source for today's African Nova Scotian communities. During the antebellum period, however, an estimated 10,000 to 30,000 black refugees reached freedom in Canada, often traveling alone or in small family groups. Those who settled in Trinidad were generally from Virginia and Maryland, and Georgia and Spanish Florida, via Bermuda, where they were evacuated on British ships from the East Coast. Some were settled in Trinidad in 1815. Those African Americans who bore arms for the British in the second Corps of Colonial Marines, recruited from the younger of the total of 4,000 refugees, settled in Trinidad in 1816, where they became known as the Merikins (also spelled as Merikens).John McNish Weiss (2002): The Merikens: Free Black American Settlers in Trinidad 1815-16. Background During 1813 and the War of 1812 with the United States, Vice Admiral Warren was ordered to receive aboard his ships any blacks who might petition him for assistance. These he was to receive as free men, not as slaves, and send them to any of several of His Majesty's colonies.GRANT, John N (1973): \\"Black immigrants into Nova Scotia, 1776-1815\\".

B. Warren, 14 November 1813, ADM 1/506. By the time that the Admiralty received the report, they had already decided to order Warren's successor, Vice-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane, to encourage emigration of African-American slaves. As with the precedents of Lord Dunmore's Proclamation of November 7, 1775 and the Philipsburg Proclamation, Cochrane issued a Proclamation in partial implementation of instructions from his superiors. He made no explicit mention of slaves, although he presumed it would be read as encouraging them to join the British: :: 'A Proclamation :: Whereas it has been represented to me that many persons now resident in the United States have expressed a desire to withdraw therefrom with a view to entering into His Majesty's service, or of being received as free settlers into some of His Majesty's colonies. :: This is therefore to give notice that all persons who may be disposed to migrate from the United States, will with their families, be received on board of His Majesty's ships or vessels of War, or at the military posts that may be established upon or near the coast of the United States, when they will have their choice of either entering into His Majesty's sea or land forces, or of being sent as free settlers to the British possessions in North America or the West Indies where they will meet with due encouragement. :: Given under my hand at Bermuda this second day of April, 1814, by command of Vice Admiral. :: Alex Cochrane'ADM 1/508 folio 579. Cochrane's proclamation made no mention of slaves, and it was widely misinterpreted by some American slaveholders as an incitement to violent revolt by their slaves. The flow of African-American refugees to the British had already been considerable. Cochrane's action did no more than confirm what had been happening for over a year. Some years after the arrival in Nova Scotia of the Black Refugees, a plan was proposed for them to be sent to the Colony of Freetown, Sierra Leone. Nearly 2,000 of their African-American brethren had relocated there in the late 18th century and had become the ruling elite, but the plan was only partly fulfilled. For the most part the Black Refugees remained in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. A small group responded to a related invitation to move to Trinidad. To a limited extent like the Black Loyalists, some of the Black Refugees' names were recorded in a document called the Halifax List: Return of American Refugee Negroes who have been received into the Province of Nova Scotia from the United States of America between 27 April 1815 and 24 October 1818. This list took no account of the considerable number of African Americans who had arrived earlier. Outcome In total, about 4000 Africans escaped to the British by way of the Royal Navy, the largest group emancipation of African Americans prior to the American Civil War.\\"Black Sailors and Soldiers in the War of 1812\\", The War of 1812, PBS (2012). About 2000 settled in Nova Scotia and about 400 settled in New Brunswick.Harvey Amani Whitfield, Blacks on the Border: The Black Refugees in British North America, 1815-1860, University of Vermont Press, 2006, p. 34. Together they were the largest single source of African-American immigrants, whose descendants formed the core of African Canadians. Black Refugees in Nova Scotia were first housed in the former prisoner-of-war camp on Melville Island. After the War of 1812, it was adapted as an immigration facility. From Melville Island, they moved to settlements around Halifax and in the Annapolis Valley. These settlements were given as licensed property for the refugees entering Nova Scotia. While it wasn't land they owned completely, it gave the refugees the chance to start communities of their own. The passengers on the shipwrecked HMS Atalante (1808) included twenty American refugee slaves from the James River in Virginia. They were among the first of the Black Refugees of the War of 1812 to reach Canada.UK National Archives, ADM 37/3811: HMS Atalante, ship's muster Other black refugees were settled in Trinidad, most having served in the Corps of Colonial Marines. They included around 200 refugees from Louisiana and East and West Florida. The community in Trinidad became known as the Merikins and their villages, established by members of different companies, still exist. Descendants The Black Refugees make up the largest single source of ancestors for Black Nova Scotians and formed the core of African Nova Scotian communities and churches that still exist today.\\"History of How Blacks Came to Nova Scotia\\" , Coastal Community Network. But an estimated 10,000 to 30,000 refugees arrived individually or in small family groups during the antebellum years, seeking freedom from slavery along the Underground Railroad from the United States. Large numbers of Black Refugees settled in North and East Preston, Nova Scotia, where their descendants still live. Many other Black refugees settled in smaller communities, such as Hammonds Plains, Beechville, Windsor and communities throughout the Nova Scotia's Annapolis Valley. Some Black Refugee families moved closer to Halifax for employment opportunities in the 1840s, forming the Halifax community of Africville. The migration included the religious leader and abolitionist Richard Preston, who established the first African Baptist church in Halifax, and the parents of William Hall, one of Canada's first winners of a Victoria Cross. The Black Refugees in Nova Scotia were largely from Virginia and Maryland, and they brought basket-making skills from the Chesapeake Region. These are still practiced by their descendants. These baskets are very distinct in style from the existing Mi'kmaw and Acadian basket-making styles by other ethnic groups in the region.Joleen Gordon, Baskets of Black Nova Scotians, Nova Scotia Museum Publications (2013), pp. 9 & 62.

After receiving a medical education under his father and at Guy's Hospital, London, where he gained several honours and prizes and obtained the ordinary medical qualifications, he returned to Polperro to assist his father, and employed his leisure in careful zoological study. Zoology In 1845 he settled in Penzance as a medical practitioner, and in a few years became recognised as an able zoological observer. Within a few weeks of his arrival at Penzance he was elected one of the secretaries and curators of the Penzance Natural History and Antiquarian Society, and he was for many years its president. His interesting annual addresses and many other papers on zoology by him are published in the Transactions of that society, vols. i. and ii. He contributed the third part (on the zoophytes) to the Cornish Fauna, written by his father; and an account of the natural history of West Cornwall to J.S. Courtney's Guide to Penzance, 1845. Other interesting papers on zoophytes, crustacea, and fishes were contributed by him to the Journal of the Royal Institution of Cornwall, the Reports of the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society, The Zoologist, Annals of Natural History, &c.;, all of which are recorded in Boase and Courtney's Bibliotheca Cornubiensis, i. 924, iii. 1138. Among these may be mentioned observations on the zoophytes of Cornwall, on the development of the frog, on the metamorphosis of the decapod crustaceans, and the natural history of the mackerel in the Polytechnic Reports for 1842 and 1844; and on the nest of the fifteen-spined stickleback in the Penzance Natural History Transactions, ii. 7983. He contributed to John Ralfs's British Desmidie√¶, 1848, and to Thomas Bell's British Stalk-eyed Crustacea, 1853. Geology Couch was also interested in Cornish geology, and did useful work in developing the difficult subject of Cornish fossil remains. From 1848 onwards he was curator of the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall, and contributed to its Transactions several valuable papers, as well as annual reports. The diseases of the Cornish miners were a subject of his careful investigation, and his papers on the mortality of miners in the Polytechnic Reports (185760) are, as far as they go, of permanent value; they were translated into French. Couch's recordings of the statistical mortality of miners were made in the districts of Lelant, St Just, St Ives, Marazion and Buryan. Richard would likely have also been motivated to produce these reports in response to the faulty nature of many official reports at the time. Death Couch died, in the full vigour of his powers, on 8 May 1863, aged47, leaving a widow and four children.

Asher (born September 7, 1937) is an American political figure and businessman from Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. He is the co-chairman of the board of directors of Asher‚Äôs Chocolates in Pennsylvania and also serves as Pennsylvania's committeeman on the Republican National Committee by appointment in 1998 by Governor Tom Ridge.PA GOP Committee bio Accessed 2008-2-23 He was a member of the 2016 Electoral College.  Education  Asher attended Germantown Academy from kindergarten through 12th grade; he played on the football team. Asher went on to graduate the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania in 1960. He is the co-chairman of the Board of Directors of Asher's Chocolates, which his family has owned for four generations.  Career   Politics  He has held several positions in the Pennsylvania Republican Party and local elected offices, including: * Commissioner of Springfield Township, Montgomery County, from 1968 through 1971. * Chairman of the Montgomery County Republican Committee 1978-86 * Delegate, Republican National Convention, Detroit 1980 and Dallas 1984 * State Chairman for Governor Dick Thornburgh‚Äôs re-election campaign in 1982 He maintains a close relationship with Tom Ridge, John Perzel, and many members of the Senate of Pennsylvania. He is known for being a successful fundraiser for Republican candidates.  1987 conviction  While chairman of the Republican State Committee of Pennsylvania Asher was convicted of perjury, racketeering, conspiracy and bribery in connection with a state contract award. He resigned after the conviction and served one year in federal prison.Mary F. Patel, Castor Roiled, Philadelphia City Paper, 1/22-28/2004 Accessed 2007-12-03 The case gained national attention in 1987 when his co- defendant in that case and political ally, Pennsylvania State Treasurer Budd Dwyer, committed suicide on television just before sentencing.  Return to politics  Asher eventually returned to politics though he was not welcomed back in his home Montgomery County. To re-establish himself, in his first political move after being released from prison, Asher helped defeat the endorsed incumbent county commissioners in Montgomery County Paul Bartle and Flo Bloss in a primary election with Jon Fox and Mario Mele. Mele then spurned the GOP and made a power sharing pact with the Democrat Joe Hoeffel. The primary election between incumbents Bartle and Bloss, and Asher-recruited Mele and Fox in 1991 ignited a civil war in Montgomery County which rages even to this day and is often cited for the dysfunction of the Montgomery County Republican Party. Asher and was appointed Pennsylvania's Republican National Committeeman in 1998. By 2004, Asher, despite not being a candidate for office, was becoming an issue in GOP campaigns. That year, a developing feud between him and then Montgomery County District Attorney Bruce Castor spilled over into the campaign. After initially recruiting Castor to run for the position of Pennsylvania Attorney General, Asher moved to support former United States Attorney Tom Corbett. Castor claimed that this was retaliation for Asher's failed attempt to gain a seat on the board of SEPTA, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority. Castor worked to deny Asher the appointment due to a state law which has been used to deny political positions to individuals with felony convictions. The resulting campaign turned bitter with charges from Castor that Corbett's primary supporter was someone who had been convicted of bribery. Asher and Castor again found themselves at odds with each other over the 2007 Montgomery County Commissioners race. After a contentious race for the nomination, Castor and incumbent Jim Matthews were selected as nominees. Castor refused to accept money from Asher. As a result, Matthews organized his own campaign fund to which Asher contributed. This support let to criticism of Matthews by Republicans, Democrats and his own running mate, Castor. All Montgomery County Republican politics is affected by the civil war which still rages with the factions being headed by Asher on the one side, and first long time GOP County Chair Frank Bartle and now former DA and current Commissioner Bruce Castor on the other. In a move reminiscent of 1991, Asher-backed County Commissioner Jim Matthews made a power sharing pact with (again) Democrat Joe Hoeffel to block Commissioner Castor from power. Asher again became a campaign story when ABC News ran stories highlighting supporters of presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani who had past legal problems.Avni Patel and Richard Esposito, Out of Spotlight, Giuliani Embraces Convicted Moneyman, ABC News, 27 November 2007 Despite the controversy, Asher has commented he has paid his debt to society following his conviction and has supported a number of Republican candidates over the years. He went on to chair Tom Corbett's successful campaign for governor in 2010.  End of tenure as RNC member  In an email to state Republican committee members on November 18 2020, former gubernatorial candidate Scott Wagner emailed GOP state committee members accusing the longtime national committeeman of orchestrating ‚Äúdirty politics‚Äù within the state party, suggesting the focus should remain on defending President Donald Trump during the impeachment hearings. After a bitter dispute erupted within the party, Asher dropped his bid for another four-year term as RNC member, saying that the dispute had become \\"destructive\\" within the party.  Awards and recognitions  Asher was named to the PoliticsPA list of \\"Pennsylvania's Top Political Activists.\\" The Pennsylvania Report named him to the 2003 \\"The Pennsylvania Report Power 75\\" list of influential figures in Pennsylvania politics and noted that he has the ability to put \\"a big bankroll behind his favorite candidates.\\" The Pennsylvania Report's 2009 \\"The Pennsylvania Report 100\\" and noted that as a \\"veteran fund-raiser and kingmaker,\\" Asher was \\"One, if not the, top power player in the state GOP.\\"  References   External links  * Asher's Lobbyist Registration Statement * 1937 births R.

He is the creator and principal presenter of the weekly prime time news program called \\"Oi Neoi Fakeloi\\" (\\"The New Files \\") on Skai TV, which is a continuation of his show in Mega Channel called \\"Oi Fakeloi \\" (\\"The Files\\"). ‚ÄúThe New Files‚Äù, which premiered in the 2010 - 2011 season, was an award- winning current affairs documentary series on domestic and international news which as of the season 2009‚Äì2010 season integrated a series of studio interviews. In January 2016 he created and is the principal presenter of the current affairs program \\"Istories\\" (Stories) on Skai TV, together with Pavlos Tsimas and Sia Kossioni. Papahelas is also a political commentator for the SKAI Evening News, a columnist and the author of two books.  Biography  Papahelas was born in Athens in 1961 the son of Aristomenis and Aikaterini Papahelas. The family's origins lie in Messinia, southern Peloponnese and in Istanbul. Papahelas grew up in the Athens district Plateia Victorias. He attended Athens College and then went to the United States for tertiary studies. He majored in economics and history at Bard College and later received a Master's in Journalism and International Relations from Columbia University. Papahelas started his journalistic career in 1983, as the New York City correspondent for the daily Greek newspaper I Avgi, then for Kathimerini, the BBC Greek service and Mega Channel. He returned to Greece in 1998 and wrote for the newspaper To Vima as well as co-hosting, with Pavlos Tsimas and Tasos Telloglou, the news program \\"Mavro Kouti \\" (\\"The Black Box\\") on Mega Channel for two years. In 2000, he launched the current affairs program \\"Oi Fakeloi \\" (\\"The Files\\") on Mega Channel which continued for seven years. He was also director of the news desk at Mega as well as the channel's political commentator. In September 2006, Papahelas began writing for Kathimerini and in April 2007 became the newspaper's editor in chief. In October 2007, Papahelas began the news program \\"Oi Neoi Fakeloi\\" (\\"The New Folders\\") on Skai TV with Tasos Telloglou and Sofia Papaioannou. Papahelas has interviewed nearly all the important political figures in modern Greece along with various international figures, among them the military commander of the Zapatista movement, Subcomandante Marcos, in his jungle headquarters in Mexico, Yasser Arafat in his headquarters in Ramallah, former UN Secretary General Kofi Atta Annan, Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates, US Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, and financier George Soros. Papahelas is the creator of a pioneering series of history documentaries, including one on the 1922 destruction of Smyrna with rare interviews and footage, the 1967-74 dictatorship in Greece, the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus, the issue of Missing Cypriots. He has interviewed many prominent Greeks such as the politician Leonidas Kyrkos and former king Constantine. In his first book, entitled ‚ÄúThe rape of Greek democracy,‚Äù Papahelas documented evidence of the relation between the CIA and the Greek colonels‚Äô group behind the junta. The cover of the book displayed a never-before published photograph of Giorgios Papadopoulos, which the coup later installed as dictator, on a hunting trip with Greek American CIA agents. On a number of occasions Papahelas has advocated for effective investigative journalism in Greece. The most well-known instance was on May 30, 2010, when he exposed a trail of offshore companies behind former Defense Minister Akis Tsochatzopoulos‚Äô real estate assets. The former Minister later denied the allegations during an interview with Papahelas and Tasos Telloglou. In 2014 he was presented with the John Dewey Award for Distinguished Public Service from Bard College, awarded annually to alumni of the college fore extraordinary contributions to the public interest. The magazine Politico included Papahelas as one of 27 most influential Europeans in the European Union. Papahelas was won a number of journalism awards, including journalist of the year, for his personal work and reports of his television programs. He has contributed columns for The New York Times and the Guardian and has been a guest at meetings of the Bilderberg Club.

Four of her sons, Konstantin, George, Yaroslav and Sviatoslav, succeeded their father as Grand Princes of Vladimir, and Yaroslav went on to become Grand Prince of Kiev around the time of the Mongol Invasion. As Yaroslav's mother, she is thus the paternal grandmother of Alexander Nevsky, whose son, Daniel of Moscow, founded the Muscovite branch of the Rurikid Dynasty. Maria's origins are disputed. Some sources say she was Ossetian or Alan and connected to the Georgian royal house, while others, such as the Uspensky Sbornik (a 13th-century text now housed in the Russian State Museum in Moscow), say she was Moravian.

The date of her death is also uncertain, as 19 March 1205 is also given in some accounts. The Novgorod First Chronicle mentions her death under the year 1205, but does not give an exact day.A. N.

Maria is venerated as a saint by the Russian Orthodox Church and is credited with founding several convents, most notably the Convent of the Assumption, known as the Princess's Convent () in Vladimir on the Kliazma. According to several accounts, the convent was founded in 1200 and Maria took the schema and the name Marfa (although this would have required her to have ended her marriage with Vsevolod, who outlived her by six years). She and her sister, Anna, were buried in the convent and her relics, along with those of several other saints, including Alexander Nevsky's first wife, Princess Alexandra, and his daughter are still kept there.

A 1999 study by the United Nations found that Sri Lanka had the second highest number of disappearances in the world and that 12,000 Sri Lankans had disappeared after being detained by the Sri Lankan security forces. A few years earlier the Sri Lankan government had estimated that 17,000 people had disappeared. In 2003 the Red Cross stated that it had received 20,000 complaints of disappearances during the Sri Lankan Civil War of which 9,000 had been resolved but the remaining 11,000 were still being investigated. Human rights groups such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Asian Human Rights Commission have documented many of the disappearances and attributed them to the Sri Lankan security forces, pro-government paramilitary groups and Sri Lankan Tamil militant groups. In 2016, the government under president Maithripala Sirisena agreed to issue a certificate of absence to relatives of over 65,000 that went missing during the civil war and the marxist uprising allowing them to temporarily manage the property and assets of missing people, to obtain provisional guardianship of their children and apply for government welfare schemes.

On 15 December 2014 Thomson was found guilty in the County Court of Victoria of thirteen charges of theft, and later convicted and fined A$25,000. Other charges of obtaining financial advantage by deception were dismissed on appeal. His conviction followed an appeal against a conviction and sentence in the Melbourne Magistrates Court on 25 March 2014 when Thomson was found guilty of 65 charges of fraud and theft for using Health Services Union funds for personal benefit; and sentenced to twelve months imprisonment, with nine months suspended over two years. Thomson was initially released on bail; and the conviction and sentence subsequently overturned on appeal. Thomson was the national secretary of the Health Services Union from 2002 until the 2007 federal election when he was elected to the House of Representatives as member for the Division of Dobell, New South Wales, for the Australian Labor Party. In April 2012 he announced his intention to sit on the crossbench as an independent member of parliament. Thomson lost his seat at the 2013 federal election. On 17 October 2018, Thomson was struck off as a lawyer.  Early life and education  Thomson was born in Wellington, New Zealand, and raised in , New South Wales. He was educated at the University of New South Wales, where he obtained a Bachelor of Commerce degree. He later completed a law degree at the University of Technology Sydney.  Union career  Thomson started his career representing hospital and ambulance workers in New South Wales as an industrial officer for the Health and Research Employee Association (HREA). He became head of the HREA Industrial Department. He was subsequently elected to the position of Assistant Secretary. In 2002, Thomson was elected as the national secretary of the Health Services Union (HSU), a trade union with which the HREA had merged. During his term at the union it was rebranded as a united federal union and the state branches adopted similar names and logos.  Use of credit cards  Succeeding Thomson as general secretary of the HSU in January 2008, Kathy Jackson identified financial irregularities in the union's accounts and engaged external auditors to investigate. Reporting in May, the audit raised \\"concerns about evidence of misuse of union funds by Mr Thomson.\\" In December, the union engaged tax specialists BDO Kendall to \\"conduct an investigation\\" over the alleged improper use of Thomson's union-issued corporate credit card. The Sydney Morning Herald revealed the allegations in April 2009; Thomson denied all wrongdoing and stated that an independent audit had not identified any inappropriate use of the card, noted that other people would have been able to incur charges on the account, and said the accusations had been fabricated by rivals within the HSU. Fair Work Australia, the federal workplace relations tribunal, conducted a three-year investigation into improprieties in the use of union funds which was tabled in the Senate on 7 May 2012. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) commenced investigations, but Thomson said he was not one of the five people of interest. On 15 October 2012 Fair Work Australia launched civil proceedings against Thomson related to his use of HSU funds. Thomson stated that he would contest these charges. On 24 October 2012 members of the NSW Police conducted a search of Thomson's residence and electorate office on the Central Coast. Eight officers loaded vehicles with computers and five large boxes of evidence. Thomson said the search was \\"routine\\" and \\"They took a couple of documents, I volunteered a couple of documents.\\" Thomson was arrested at his Central Coast electorate office on 31 January 2013. He faced 173 fraud and theft charges relating to his time at the Health Services Union. NSW Police carried out the arrest warrant on the request of the Victoria Police. Thomson was granted bail and was required to appear before the Melbourne Magistrates Court in early February. Thomson denied the allegations, and said that he would be \\"vigorously defending these charges.\\" On 18 February 2014, Thomson was found guilty of defrauding the HSU. Thomson returned to court for a plea hearing on his sentence on 18 March. He also faced civil proceedings to repay $ stolen from the HSU; and the Fair Work Commissioner considered commencing civil proceedings on matters where the magistrate dismissed the criminal charges. On 25 March 2014, Thomson was sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment with nine months suspended for two years. Magistrate Charlie Rozencwajg said Thomson had shown \\"arrogance in the extreme\\", a \\"breach of trust of the highest order\\" in misusing members' funds and said Thomson had shown no remorse. The magistrate also said \\"Nothing has been put before me to suggest that these offences were committed for anything other than greed\\". Thomson was granted bail to appear in the Victorian County Court on 24 November to appeal both his conviction and sentence. On 15 December 2014, Thomson was found not guilty of 49 charges of obtaining financial advantage by deception because of a prosecution error. Thomson was proven guilty of thirteen charges of theft, convicted, and fined A$25,000. In the plea hearing, and handing down the fine and conviction Judge Douglas said that: \\"Whether it's sex workers or a bottle of wine, it seems to me both of those are self-indulgent,\\" and \\"It's none of my business that he used a sex worker but it's my business that he used other people's money.\\"  Political career  In November 2007, Thomson stood as the Labor candidate for the seat of Dobell on the Central Coast. He was elected, winning the seat from the incumbent, Ken Ticehurst of the Liberal Party. Until August 2011, Thomson was the Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics as well as a member of the Privileges Committee and the Petitions Committee. As chair of the economics committee Thomson oversaw inquiries into bank competition and a second report into productivity in Australia. In December 2011, The Sydney Morning Herald alleged that Thomson had plagiarised internet sources, including Wikipedia, when tabling a report to parliament after an overseas trip. The report in question was unsigned and undated in its cover letter.  Impact of the Health Services Union expenses affair  While serving as Member for Dobell, he was investigated by Fair Work Australia for nearly four years over allegations that he used his Health Services Union credit card for improper purposes, commonly referred to as the Health Services Union expenses affair. In April 2012 Thomson asked to be suspended from the Labor Party after a discussion with the then Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, and announced his intention to sit on the crossbench as an independent member of parliament. In a statement to the House on 21 May 2012, Thomson professed his innocence and used parliamentary privilege to name a number of individuals and claim that he was set up. He contested his seat at the 2013 election as an independent candidate, however lost to the Liberals' Karen McNamara. Following criminal proceedings where Thomson was found guilty of theft and fraud charges, the Federal Parliament voted in favour of a motion of \\"regret\\" and apologised to the individuals named in Thomson's statement to the House on 21 May 2012. The matter was also referred to Parliament's Privileges Committee to investigate whether Thomson deliberately misled the House. On 4 April 2014 the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party expelled Thomson as a member of the party. On 11 October 2016, Thomson applied to the Law Society of New South Wales for a practising certificate. The Law Society refused to grant a practising certificate on the basis of his criminal convictions and informed the Prothonotary of the Supreme Court of NSW of that refusal. That led to an application by the Prothonotary to the Supreme Court for declarations that Thomson was not a fit and proper person to remain on the NSW roll of lawyers, and that his name should be removed from the roll. The declarations sought were made by the Court on 17 October 2018.  Personal life  Thomson has been married three times, first when employed as an industrial officer at HREA to Lyn Bos-Sharma, then to Christa, and then, on 21 January 2011, to Zoe Arnold, a radio newsreader and media advisor. The couple have two daughters, Matilda, born in July 2009, and, Adelaide, born in September 2011.

Its first choreographer was George Balanchine. Stravinsky began composition in December 1953 but was interrupted the next year; he resumed work in 1956 and concluded on April 27, 1957. The music was first performed on June 17, 1957, in Los Angeles conducted by Robert Craft, while the first stage performance was given by the New York City Ballet on December 1, 1957, at the City Center of Music and Drama, New York . Between those dates the S√ºdwestfunk in Germany made the work's first studio recording; the Sinfonieorchester des S√ºdwestfunks Baden-Baden, as it was then called, was led by Hans Rosbaud. This was released on the Wergo label seven years later and remains in the catalog, for sale online from Amazon.de . The composition's long gestation period covers an interesting juncture in Stravinsky's composing career, in which he moved from a diatonic musical idiom to one based on twelve-tone technique; the music of the ballet thus demonstrates a unique symbiosis of musical idioms. The ballet has no story, but consists of a series of dance movements in which various groups of dancers interact in pairs, trios, quartets, etc. A number of the movements are based on 17th-century French court dances ‚Äì saraband, galliard and bransle. It was danced as part of City Ballet's 1982 Stravinsky Centennial Celebration. Form Stravinsky laid out the ballet in a duodecimal form, with four large sections each consisting of three dances. A Prelude and two Interludes occur between the large sections, but this does not fundamentally affect the twelve-part design because their function is caesural and compensatory : *I. # Pas-de-quatre (4 male dancers) # Double pas-de-quatre (8 female dancers) # Triple pas-de-quatre (4 male + 8 female dancers) *Prelude *II. (First pas-de-trois: 1 male, 2 female dancers) #Sarabande-step (1 male dancer) #Gaillarde (2 female dancers) #Coda (1 male, 2 female dancers) *Interlude *III. (Second pas-de-trois: 2 male, 1 female dancers) #Bransle simple (2 male dancers) #Bransle gay (1 female dancer) #Bransle double (2 male, 1 female dancers) *Interlude *IV. #Pas-de-deux (1 male, 1 female dancer) #Four Duos (4 male, 4 female dancers) #Four Trios (4 male, 8 female dancers)  Instrumentation  Agon is scored for a large orchestra consisting of piccolo, 3 flutes, 2 oboes, English horn, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns, 4 trumpets, 3 trombones (2 tenor, 1 bass), harp, piano, mandolin, timpani, tom-tom, xylophone, castanets, and strings. At no point does the entire orchestra play a tutti. Each section is scored for a different combination of instruments.  Music  This was not the first composition in which Stravinsky employed serial techniques, but it was the first in which he used a twelve-tone row, introduced in the second coda, at bar 185. Earlier in the work, Stravinsky had employed a seventeen-tone row, in bars 104‚Äì107, and evidence from the sketches suggests a close relationship between these two rows . The Bransle Double is based on a different twelve-tone series, the hexachords of which are treated independently . Those hexachords first appear separately in the Bransle Simple (for two male dancers) and Bransle Gay (for solo female dancer), and are then combined to form a twelve-tone row in the Bransle Double. These three dances together constitute the second pas-de-trois .

He played college football for the University of Michigan Wolverines in 1944 and from 1946 to 1948. He was a consensus selection at end on the 1948 College Football All-America Team. Rifenburg played professionally in the National Football League (NFL) with the Detroit Lions for one season in 1950. After retiring from football he settled in Buffalo and became a sports broadcaster. He worked as a color commentator and as a play-by-play announcer for the Buffalo Bulls. He hosted various television and radio sports shows and was eventually inducted into the Buffalo Broadcasters Hall of Fame. In college, he led the Big Ten Conference in single season receptions during his senior year and set Michigan Wolverines receptions records for both career touchdown and single-season touchdowns. He had also been a Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA) state champion in both basketball and track and field. His college career was interrupted by World War II service, and his high school career was also affected by the war due to the MHSAA's cancellation of state championships in all sports in 1943. High school Rifenburg was born in Petoskey, Michigan, and raised in Kalamazoo, Michigan before his family moved to Saginaw, Michigan. Rifenburg was a star athlete at Saginaw's Arthur Hill High School in football, basketball, and track and field. In 1943, Michigan canceled boys high school tournaments in all sports due to World War II, and they did not return until the fall of 1944. In 1944, he led Arthur Hill High to the MHSAA Class A high school basketball championship (over Kalamazoo Central High School), scoring 24 points, including 17 in the second half, of the championship game. Rifenburg was also the state champion in 1944 in both the shot put and high jump . He also led Arthur Hill in football, and his high school accomplishments are featured in Glory: The history of Saginaw County sports by Jack Tany (ASIN B0006RH9Z6), which is a book on high school sports in Saginaw County, Michigan. Rifenburg was named All State in football, basketball and track. It is ironic that Rifenburg was born in Petoskey, Michigan in 1926 for several reasons. Ted Petoskey preceded Rifenburg as an All-American end on the University of Michigan football team. Petoskey had excelled as a representative of Saginaw County in MHSAA competition. Petoskey posted significant football accomplishments in 1926 making 1926 a significant year for himself as well. Achieving All-American status as an end at Michigan would be Rifenburg's next step after excelling in MHSAA competition. College In the fall of 1944, Rifenburg enrolled at the University of Michigan. The United Press syndicate ran a feature article about Rifenburg in September 1944 that opened as follows: \\"Another great end has made his appearance on the Big Ten football horizon in the person of Dick Rifenburg, 18-year-old Michigan freshman. Every so often a great offensive end comes along, a player who has to learn how to play defense, but who has the natural speed, smooth actions, height and big hands that is the mark of an outstanding pass receiver. Rifenburg has laid claim to that rating. A loose-limbed 180-pound freshman from Saginaw, Mich., Rifenberg is being boomed as the Big Ten's next 'freshman sensation.'\\" As a freshman, he caught two touchdown passes in his first college football game against Iowa. In an article titled \\"Teens and TNT,\\" Time reported on Rifenburg's performance: \\"Of the few teams already in action, Michigan's teens rang the freshman bell loudest last week by winning their opener, 12 -to-7, against the strong Iowa Seahawks (Naval Pre-Flight); 6-ft. 4 Freshman End Dick Rifenburg caught passes and ran for both Michigan touchdowns.\\" Rifenburg catching a touchdown pass against Indiana in 1947. Rifenburg's college career was interrupted by World War II service in the United States Navy, but after missing the 1945 season, he returned to play for the Wolverines from 1946 to 1948. Rifenburg played for the Wolverines in consecutive undefeated National Championship seasons in 1947 and 1948. He started nine games for the 1947 team. The 1947 team referred to as \\"Michigan's Mad Magicians\\" is considered to be the greatest University of Michigan football team of all time. Rifenberg and teammate Len Ford had the reputation as the team practical jokers. During the 1947 game against Wisconsin, Rifenburg started calling signals for the Badgers. Wisconsin's offense protested to officials, who \\"prowled the Wolverines secondary but never caught their man.\\" Rifenburg continued to scramble Badger signals, as Rifenburg's teammates laughed at his scheme. In the January 1, 1948 Rose Bowl that season, Michigan rolled to a 49-0 victory over USC, and they outgained the Trojans 491 yards to 133. Rifenburg caught a 29-yard pass for the game's final score. In the 1948 championship season, Rifenburg scored eight touchdowns, caught 22 passes, and gained 610 yards (508 receiving and 102 rushing). Rifenburg was the second highest scoring end in the nation in 1948, and he was a consensus All-American as a senior, being selected as first team on nine of the 11 All- American teams. Rifenburg led the Big Ten in receptions. Although Rifenburg finished fourth among midwestern Heisman voters in 1948, he did not finish among the top eight. By comparison, Notre Dame end Leon Hart won the Heisman Trophy in 1949 but made only eight of the 11 All-American teams. It is not clear why Rifenburg did not finish higher. However, it is fairly clear that sportswriters of that era had a bias against Michigan. In the Associated Press poll at the end of the 1947 season, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish were ranked ahead of the University of Michigan, though both teams were undefeated. Some noted that every Southern AP voter had voted for Notre Dame, which had yet to integrate, whereas three of Michigan's star players (Bob Mann, Gene Derricotte, and Len Ford) were African-American. The Southern schools refused even to schedule games against schools that played African-American players.John Kryk, \\"Natural Enemies: Major College Football's Oldest, Fiercest Rivalry,\\" Taylor Trade Publishing, 2004, , p. 145. Rifenburg was considered one of the greatest Wolverines of the 1940s. In four seasons with the Michigan Wolverines, Rifenburg played in 32 games and had over 1,000 yards of total offense. Rifenburg held the University of Michigan's single season and career record for touchdown receptions (eight in a season; sixteen career) until his records were broken by Anthony Carter in 1980. Professional career In 1948, Rifenburg was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the 15th round of the NFL draft, and he was also drafted by the New York Yankees of the All- America Football Conference. He had intended to play in 1949 with the Yankees, but suffered a knee injury in a practice session for the August 1949 Chicago College All-Star Game. Press accounts at the time noted that the injury \\"will probably keep him out of pro football all season, if not forever.\\" The incident led to a debate as to whether NFL owners should \\"bar their men from playing with the college all-stars.\\" Rifenburg landed a job at WJR radio in Detroit, but he left his sportscaster's job to join the Detroit Lions. In the 1950 NFL season, Rifenburg came back from his injury to play for the Detroit Lions. He played in 12 games and had ten receptions for 96 yards and one touchdown for the 1950 Lions. Rifenburg recalled that his playing time with the Lions was limited because the Lions also signed 1949 Heisman Trophy winner Leon Hart, who played the same position. In May 1951, he announced he was retiring from professional football to become sports director at a radio station in Buffalo. He was hired as a sportscaster by WBEN (now known as WIVB), which had just started the first television station in Buffalo and the only one serving Southern Ontario. This was an early foray into television by the Buffalo Evening News. In the 1950s, Rifenburg hosted a popular panel show called \\"Let's Talk Sports\\" in Buffalo and also pioneered an early morning exercise program. He also worked for WBEN (AM) and WBEN (FM) and as the sideline announcer for Buffalo Bills games along with Van Miller, the long time Bills play-by-play announcer. In addition, he served as the play-by-play announcer for the University of Buffalo Bulls football team. As a radio broadcaster, he is remembered for things ranging from ski reports, to 17 years worth of \\"Breakfast At ‚Äî\\" programs live from various local restaurants, to 27 years as the WBEN-AM All Night Show host. After 30 years with WBEN and a change in ownership for the station, his show was replaced with the Mutual Network's The Larry King Show. In the 1980s, Rifenburg taught communications at Buffalo's Medaille College and served as a disc jockey on Public Broadcasting's radio station WEBR (now WDCZ). He also sold ads for Buffalo Evening News competitor, Buffalo Courier-Express. Rifenburg's final employer was Erie County, who hired him as an inmate training supervisor at the Erie County Correctional Facility. Rifenburg was posthumously inducted into the Buffalo Broadcasters Hall of Fame in September 2007. He was given the Golden Age Award which is reserved for \\"those who did it first, the people who had no pattern to follow.\\" The Hall of Fame award was presented to Rifenburg's wife, Jane. In her acceptance speech, Jane Rifenburg observed that despite all of her late husband's achievements, there was one thing he had never received: \\"He had a great career, but he never had a trophy. And now he has.\\" Family Rifenburg lived 37 of his years in Buffalo. His first wife, Ruth Arlene Martini, died in September 1961. His second wife, the former Jane Morris, was the head of the Buffalo Jills cheerleaders when they met. Rifenburg, who was survived by three sons, (Douglas A., Gary R., and Bruce R.) one daughter (Wendy J. Colf) and two grandchildren, died in Cheektowaga, New York in December 1994; he was 68 years old. Doug was a 1988 first team football All- Western New York linebacker for Clarence High School.

The composition of the painting has been drafted in monochrome onto the primed wooden panel. At an unknown date after Leonardo's death, the panel was cut into five pieces before eventually being restored into its original form. Description The oil draft of an unfinished painting depicts Saint Jerome in advanced age during his retreat to the Syrian desert, where he lived the life of a hermit. The saint kneels in a rocky landscape, gazing toward a crucifix which can be discerned faintly sketched in at the extreme right of the painting. In Jerome's right hand he holds a rock with which he is traditionally shown beating his chest in penance. At his feet is the lion which became a loyal companion after he extracted a thorn from its paw. The lion, the stone and a cardinal's hat are the traditional attributes of the saint.Christian Iconography - Saint Jerome On the left-hand side of the panel the background is a distant landscape of a lake surrounded by precipitous mountains shrouded in mist. To the right-hand side, the only discernible feature is a faintly-sketched church, seen through the opening in the rocks. The church's presence may allude to Jerome's position in Western Christianity as one of the Doctors of the Church. The composition of the painting is innovative for the oblique trapezoid form of the figure of the saint. The angular forms contrast with the sinuous form of the lion which transcribes an \\"S\\" across the bottom of the painting. The lion is also a symbol of power and strength associated with the Gospel of Mark which Jerome translated into Latin. The form of Saint Jerome prefigures that of the Virgin Mary in the Virgin of the Rocks. The rendering of the muscles in the neck and shoulders is seen as the first of Leonardo's anatomical drawings. Interpretation Penitence is one of the themes central to religious iconography. Jerome, whose main fame is his translation of the Bible into Latin, the so-called Vulgate, in old age retreated to the wilderness as a penitent. Here, as in any other paintings of this subject, he meditates on the crucified Christ. Beyond the crucifix may be seen the faint image of a church, probably representing vision of the New Jerusalem, the heavenly afterlife to which Jerome aspires. It has been speculated by George Bent that Leonardo's choice of subject matter here might relate directly to Leonardo's own spiritual life, most particualry to an accusation in 1476 of his involvement in homosexual activities with a male prostitute Jacopo Saltarelli.George Bent. Leonardo da Vinci and the Italian High Renaissance. The Great Courses series. 2013. Charges were brought on four young men because of an annonymous accusation. Homosexual activity was illegal in Florence. They were not convicted.Wittkower and Wittkower, pp. 170‚Äî71 According to Bent, Leonardo may be seen as experiencing remorse either for his ordeal or his transgression which allowed him to identify more closely with the suffering depicted in the Jerome oil sketch.George Bent. Leonardo da Vinci and the Italian High Renaissance. The Great Courses series. 2013. Provenance The panel has been reduced in size and the remaining part was cut into five parts at some point in its history and was reassembled for the early 19th-century collector, Cardinal Fesch, the uncle of Napoleon Bonaparte. Popular legend has it that the cardinal discovered the part of the panel with the saint's torso being offered as a table top or box lid in a shop in Rome. Five years later, he found another piece being used as a wedge for shoemaker's bench.Brockwell, Maurice Walter, Leonardo da Vinci. Kessinger, 2004, p. 7 Whatever the circumstances of Fesch's finding the parts, the repaired panel was sold by his descendants to Pope Pius IX, who installed it in the Pinacoteca Vaticana, now part of the Vatican Museums. The Saint Jerome was once believed to have been part of the collection of the painter Angelica Kauffman, but this theory too has been rejected by recent scholars.Z√∂llner, Frank, Leonardo da Vinci: the complete paintings and sculptures. London: Taschen, 2003, p. 221 Exhibitions Although normally on display at the Vatican Museums, Saint Jerome was on loan and displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York during the summer of 2019 in the Robert Lehman wing starting on July 15 to the start of October. The display was a dedicated stand-alone presentation of the painting under subdued lighting for preservation purposes.Holland Cotter. \\"What Leonardo Da Vinci Could Not Finish\\".

History The house was built around 1811, at the corner of what is now known as Lombard and Front Streets, which at the time was a very wealthy part of Baltimore. In 1818 it was purchased for the sum of $20,000 by Richard Caton, the husband of Mary, youngest daughter of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. For the last twelve years of his life, Charles Carroll spent his winters in the house, often receiving distinguished visitors there.National Park Service survey of historic sites and buildings It was in this house that he died. The Catons continued to reside at the mansion until 1846, when the last of the Caton family died. The mansion remained empty for the next eleven years and was purchased in 1855 by the Sisters of Mercy. The neighborhood underwent a drastic change in the eleven years prior to 1855 and had gone from the wealthiest part of town to the home of poor immigrants. The Sisters of Mercy rented the once grand mansion to immigrants who turned the first floor into a saloon and the second floor into apartments for German and Russian Jews, until 1868 when the Sisters sold the mansion for the paltry sum of $1,000. Over the next forty years, Carroll Mansion served as a saloon, furniture store, and in 1904 news articles report that the mansion was being used as a sweatshop to produce clothing.\\"The Old Carroll Mansion\\", Washington Post, October 4, 1904. In 1914 the mansion was deeded to the City of Baltimore and in 1918 it became Baltimore's first vocational school. The mansion's larger rooms were used as classrooms and the grounds housed the various trade shops. The vocational school continued to operate and offer courses in tailoring, printing, and auto mechanics until 1928.\\"Old Carroll Mansion Open to Public View\\", New York Times, June 17, 1928. In 1928 the Carroll Mansion was restored and opened to the public with exhibits of antiques. The Carroll Mansion underwent major renovations in 1935 to include showers, indoor toilets, and a new heating system and served as The Carroll Mansion Recreation Center from 1937 to 1954, at which time the doors were closed once again. In the 1960s the mansion was slated to be torn down and a gas station built where the mansion stood for the last 150 years. The citizens of Baltimore protested said plans, and upon his election in 1962, on a platform emphasizing urban renewal, Mayor Theodore McKeldin pledged that the historic Carroll Mansion would be fully restored. After major restoration efforts, the doors of the Carroll Mansion opened to the public once again in 1967 as a museum and a collection of antiques to mirror the 1820s and 1830s when the Caton and Carroll families occupied the mansion was started. In 1985 the mansion became part of the Baltimore City Life Museums and the collection was expanded to include wallpaper, paint, china, silver, and furniture of the 1820s and 1830s. The mansion operated as a museum for thirty years, from 1967 to 1997, when the doors closed yet again. The museum remained closed until 2002 when Carroll Museums, Inc. reopened the museum. The Carroll Museum remains open today where tours are offered to the public. Changing art exhibits are also displayed.

Located in the southwest portion of the province, it is adjacent to the United States border, neighbouring Phillips County in Montana.  History  The RM of Val Marie No. 17 incorporated as a rural municipality on January 1, 1969. Louis-Pierre Gravel, missionary and promoter of much French Catholic immigration to southwestern Saskatchewan, originally called the settlement Rivi√®re des Fran√ßais after the nearby Frenchman River. But for an unknown reason, in a 1911 report to the superintendent of immigration, his formally proposed name became Libreval (\\"Free Valley\\"). Ultimately, neither of Gravel's suggestions was used, and Val Marie (\\"Valley of Mary\\"), was coined by Fr. Claude Passaplan, missionary priest in the area. Before coming to Val Marie, Passaplan served as the first Roman Catholic parish priest in Swift Current.  Geography   Communities and localities  The RM surrounds one urban municipality, the eponymous village of Val Marie.

Much of the RM is occupied by large community pastures. The Val Marie Irrigation Project controls two artificial lakes on the Frenchman River, which are used to operate a drip irrigation system in the region adjacent to the village.

He served in the cabinet of the government of Bill Davis. Background Meen was born in Toronto, Ontario in 1924. He was educated as a lawyer. He worked for Gulf Oil Ltd. and was a partner in his own law firm, Fraser and Meen. In 1951, he married Shirley Code. They raised three daughters together. He died at Woodhaven Long Term Care Markham, Ontario in 2008. Politics In the 1967 provincial election he ran as the Progressive Conservative candidate in the Toronto riding of York East. He defeated Liberal candidate Peter Lowry by 4,402 votes. In 1971 he faced a challenge by popular East York mayor True Davidson but easily defeated her by 7,544 votes. He was also re-elected in 1975. In February 1974, Meen was appointed to cabinet as Minister of Revenue in the government of Bill Davis. In February 1977, he was reassigned as Minister of Correctional Services. In April 1977, he announced his intention to retire from politics and did not run in the June election.

Cabinet positions Later life In 1980, Meen was appointed a provincial court judge by Attorney General Roy McMurtry. In 1985, he sparked controversy by dismissing trespassing charges laid against protesters outside Henry Morgentaler's abortion clinic in Toronto. He said in his judgment, \\"There is considerable evidence that life begins at the moment of conception.\\" Frequently praising the defendants in court he went further to say, \\"the clinic was operating outside the law, and as such was therefore murder.\\" Meen felt the protesters were not guilty because they were acting to prevent a bigger crime. NDP MPP Evelyn Gigantes criticized Meen's decision and called for the judge to be censured. Attorney General Ian Scott refused to do so saying that Meen's decision was irrelevant to the abortion debate.

She worked in installation art, assemblage, photography, and lenticular printing. She was most famous for her collaborations with her husband and creative partner Edward Kienholz, from their meeting in 1972 until his sudden death in 1994. She continued to produce her own artworks for the rest of her life. Early life Reddin was born in Los Angeles, California, in 1943. Her father, Thomas Reddin (1916-2004) was born in New York City and worked in Los Angeles as a police officer; he would eventually serve as chief of the Los Angeles Police Department from 1967 to 1969 and appear on the cover of Time magazine in July 1968. Her mother, real estate broker Betty Parsons Reddin (b. 1921), was born in Denver, Colorado. Nancy was the youngest of three children, born after older brothers Thomas T. Reddin (1938 ‚Äì 1985) and Michael Gray Reddin (b. 1942). Reddin was first married at age 19. She had one child from this marriage, Christine, in 1964, but the marriage ended after two years. Reddin received no formal training in art, and worked several odd jobs in Los Angeles before beginning her collaborations with Ed Kienholz in 1972. Second marriage and collaboration Reddin met Ed Kienholz at a party in Los Angeles in 1972. At that time, Kienholz was already an established artist, being a founding member of the Ferus Gallery and a long-standing participant in the Los Angeles avant garde scene. He had full custody of two children, Jenny and Noah, from one of his four previous marriages, and would later legally adopt Reddin's daughter Christine. Reddin and Kienholz began their creative collaborations the same year they met. Their first work together was The Middle Islands No. 1, now in the collection of the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Humleb√¶k, Denmark. Ed Kienholz continued to receive sole credit for these collaborations until 1981, when he publicly announced for the first time that all works after 1972 should be retroactively credited instead to \\"Kienholz\\", in collective reference to both Ed and Nancy. In 1973, Kienholz received a grant from DAAD to work in the Federal Republic of Germany. The couple sold their house in Los Angeles, and Reddin moved with Kienholz and their children to West Berlin. The entire family, including the children, contributed to the creation of the exhibit Kienholz created using the grant. Reddin and Kienholz would divide their time between Berlin and their home in the rural Idaho Panhandle until Edward Kienholz's sudden death in 1994. During their marriage, Reddin and Kienholz worked prolifically, primarily in installation art. They maintained studios in Berlin and in Hope, Idaho. Kienholz received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1976, and their work was especially critically acclaimed in Europe. After struggling with diabetes for years, Edward Kienholz died suddenly in 1994 of a massive heart attack in Sandpoint, Idaho. He was buried in a 1940 Packard automobile, which Reddin steered into the gravesite. Later work and death In addition to maintaining Kienholz's estate, Reddin continued to work in multiple media during the decades after 1994. She organized and consulted on several major exhibitions of their collaborative work, as well as solo exhibitions of artworks she created after the death of her husband. In addition to continuing her work in assemblage sculpture, Reddin returned to an early interest in photography and created several works using lenticular images.

Forward was present when the Germans bombarded Hartlepool in mid-December 1914, but played no significant role in the battle.

After returning home in 1919, she was sold for scrap in 1921. Design and description The Forward-class ships were one of four classes of scout cruisers ordered by the Admiralty in 1902‚Äì1903 and 1903‚Äì1904 Naval Programmes. These ships were intended to work with destroyer flotillas, leading their torpedo attacks and backing them up when attacked by other destroyers, although they quickly became less useful as destroyer speeds increased before the First World War.

Their crew consisted of 289 officers and ratings.Friedman 2009, pp. 100, 294, 301 The ships were powered by a pair of three-cylinder triple- expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, using steam provided by a dozen Thornycroft boilers.

They also carried eight 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns and two above-water 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes, one on each broadside. The ships' protective deck armour ranged in thickness from and the conning tower had armour inches thick. They had a waterline belt thick. Construction and career Forward was laid down on 22 October 1903 by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company in their Govan shipyard. She was launched on 27 August 1904 and completed on 22 August 1905.Morris, p. 112 Not long after completion, two additional 12-pounder guns were added and the 3-pounder guns were replaced with six QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss guns.Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 85 The ship was in initially in reserve until she was assigned to the Channel Fleet in 1907. Forward became leader of the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla in early 1909, joined the 4th Destroyer Flotilla in October 1909, the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla in the Nore Command in 1910, becoming its leader in June 1913.Gardiner & Gray, p. 17 About 1911‚Äì1912, her main guns were replaced by nine guns, arranged four on each broadside and the remaining gun on the quarterdeck.McBride, p. 274 At the start of the war she was part of the 9th Destroyer Flotilla, on the Shetland Patrol. In 1914 she was transferred to the 7th Destroyer Flotilla on the Humber and rejoined the 9th Flotilla, now based in Hartlepool, under the command of Captain Alan Brown, who was also the captain of the scout cruiser . On 15 December 1914 Forward, Patrol and the 3rd Division of the 9th Flotilla were in Hartlepool, while the 4th Division was patrolling off Whitby. On the morning of 16 December the Germans bombarded Hartlepool, led by the battlecruisers and and the armoured cruiser . Hartlepool was a tidal harbour, and at low tide it was difficult for the cruisers to get out to sea. That morning the destroyers , , and had been sent out at 05:30, and had reported that the tide was very low and the swell outside the harbour was very high. Brown decided that it was too dangerous for the cruisers and the submarine to go out on patrol.Massie, pp. 322‚Äì323 At 08:10, the German ships appeared off Hartlepool and opened fire on the town. Their initial targets were the two gun emplacements that protected the harbour, but they soon opened fire on the docks and harbour entrance. Because she already had steam up, Patrol was able to leave harbour, Forward did not and was trying to raise steam during the entire battle. When she did finally get out of Hartlepool, the German battlecruisers had already turned east to make their escape. By the time that Forward exited the harbour, they were out of sight.Massie, p. 323 After the raid Forward was sent to the 7th Destroyer Flotilla in the Humber. In May 1915 she was one of five of the seven surviving scout cruisers to make up the 6th Light Cruiser Squadron, whose duties were to guard the east coast against Zeppelin raids. This squadron was soon broken up as newer ships became available, and Forward was sent to the Mediterranean. From July 1916 to the end of the war she served in the Aegean with her sister Foresight.

Foresight was sent to the Mediterranean in mid-1915 and was then assigned to the Aegean Sea a year later, together with her sister ship, , and remained there until the end of the war. After returning home in 1919, she was sold for scrap in 1920. Design and description The Forward-class ships were one of four classes of scout cruisers ordered by the Admiralty in 1902‚Äì1903 and 1903‚Äì1904 Naval Programmes. These ships were intended to work with destroyer flotillas, leading their torpedo attacks and backing them up when attacked by other destroyers, although they quickly became less useful as destroyer speeds increased before the First World War. They had a length between perpendiculars of , a beam of and a draught of . The ships displaced at normal load and at deep load. Their crew consisted of 289 officers and ratings.Friedman 2009, pp. 100, 294, 301 The ships were powered by a pair of three-cylinder triple- expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, using steam provided by a dozen Thornycroft boilers.

They also carried eight 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns and two above-water 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes, one on each broadside. The ships' protective deck armour ranged in thickness from and the conning tower had armour inches thick. They had a waterline belt thick. Construction and career HMS Foresight was laid down by the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company at their Govan shipyard on 24 October 1903, launched on 8 October 1904 and completed on 8 September 1905.Friedman 2009, p. 301 Not long after completion, two additional 12-pounder guns were added and the 3-pounder guns were replaced with six QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss guns.Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 85 The ship was in the reserve of the Portsmouth Division of the Home Fleet from completion until October 1909, when she joined the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla as its leader. In 1910 she joined the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla, then in 1911 the 6th Flotilla at Dover.Gardiner & Gray, p. 17 About 1911‚Äì1912, her main guns were replaced by nine guns, arranged four on each broadside and the remaining gun on the quarterdeck.McBride, p. 274 Foresight was reduced to reserve in early 1912. In November 1913, she accidentally collided with the destroyer . At the start of the First World War she was assigned to the Dover Patrol, then the 8th Destroyer Flotilla, still at Dover. She took part in the operations off the Flanders coast during October 1914 that helped to protect the Allied flank during the battle of the Yser. In May 1915 she was temporarily transferred to the 6th Light Cruiser Squadron on the Humber, guarding against Zeppelin raids on the east coast. In 1915 she served in the Mediterranean and in July 1916 in the Aegean with her sister ship HMS Forward until the end of the war. In November 1916, she assisted the wounded survivors of HMHS Britannic and was paid off in June 1919. The ship was sold for scrap on 3 March 1920.Gardiner & Gray, pp. 14, 17 Notes Footnotes  Bibliography   External links *Forward class in World War I *History of the Forward class Forward-class cruisers World War I cruisers of the United Kingdom 1904 ships Ships built on the River Clyde ","title":"HMS Foresight (1904)"},{"id":"14426749","text":"The Greatest Gift is a 1943 short story written by Philip Van Doren Stern which became the basis for the film It's a Wonderful Life (1946). It was self- published as a booklet in 1943 and published as a book in 1944. The film was nominated for five Oscars and has been recognized by the American Film Institute as one of the 100 best American films ever made, placing number 11 on its initial 1998 greatest movie list and also placed number one on its list of the most inspirational American films of all time. Plot summary George Pratt, a man who is dissatisfied with his life, contemplates suicide. As he stands on a bridge on Christmas Eve 1943, he is approached by a strange, unpleasantly dressed but well-mannered man with a bag. The man strikes up a conversation, and George tells the man that he wishes he had never been born. The man tells him that his wish has been granted and that he was never born. The man tells George that he should take the bag with him and pretend to be a door-to-door brush salesman if anyone addresses him. George returns to his town, and discovers that no one knows him. His friends have taken different and often worse paths through life due to his absence. His little brother, whom he had saved from death in a swimming accident, perished without George to rescue him. George finds the woman he knows as his wife married to someone else. He offers her a complimentary upholstery brush, but he is forced to leave the house by her husband. Their son pretends to shoot him with a toy cap gun, and shouts, \\"You're dead. Why won't you die?\\" George returns to the bridge and questions the strange man. The man explains that George wanted more when he had already been given the greatest gift of all: the gift of life. George digests the lesson and begs the man to return his life. The man agrees. George returns home and finds everything restored to normal. He hugs his wife and tells her that he thought he had lost her. She is confused. As he is about to explain, his hand bumps a brush on the sofa behind him. Without turning around, George knows the brush was the one he had presented to her earlier.

The story came to the attention of RKO Pictures producer David Hempstead, who showed it to actor Cary Grant. Grant became interested in playing the lead role. RKO purchased the motion-picture rights for $10,000 in April 1944.\\"Tempest in Hollywood\\", New York Times, April 23, 1944, p. X3. After several screenwriters worked on adaptations, RKO sold the rights to the story in 1945 to Frank Capra's production company for the same $10,000, which he adapted into It's a Wonderful Life. The story was first published as a book in December 1944, with illustrations by Rafaello Busoni. Stern also sold it to Reader's Scope magazine, which published the story in its December 1944 issue, and to the magazine Good Housekeeping, which published it under the title The Man Who Was Never Born in its January 1945 issue (published in December 1944). According to the American Film Institute and Turner Classic Movies, Stern did not copyright the story until 1945, when he sold the film rights.\\"Notes for 'It's a Wonderful Life'\\".

Republic Pictures has used the belated copyright on the original story to enforce an indirect copyright on It's a Wonderful Life, which itself lapsed into the public domain in 1975. Film At the suggestion of RKO studio chief Charles Koerner, Frank Capra read The Greatest Gift and immediately saw its film potential. In 1945, RKO, anxious to unload the project, sold the rights to Capra's production company, Liberty Films, which had a nine-film distribution agreement with RKO, for $10,000, and threw in three script adaptations for free. Capra claimed the script was purchased for $50,000.00.Capra 1971, p. 376. Capra, along with writers Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, with Jo Swerling, Michael Wilson, and Dorothy Parker brought in to \\"polish\\" the script,Cox 2003, p. 23. turned the story and fragments from the three scripts into a screenplay that Capra renamed It's a Wonderful Life. The script underwent many revisions throughout pre-production and during filming.Goodrich et al. 1986, pp. 135, 200. Final screenplay credit went to Goodrich, Hackett and Capra, with \\"additional scenes\\" by Jo Swerling. In the film, the main character (renamed George Bailey) was played by James Stewart, the stranger (re-imagined as an angel named Clarence Odbody) was played by Henry Travers, and George's wife (renamed Mary Hatch) was played by Donna Reed. The names for some characters in the film were taken from characters in the story, but given different personalities or roles in the story (e.g., Mr. Potter owned a photography studio in the story, but was a conniving banker in the film). In the reality in which George was never born, Mary never marries in the film, but in the story she marries a man named Art Jenkins.

African-American neighborhoods or black neighborhoods are types of ethnic enclaves found in many cities in the United States. Generally, an African American neighborhood is one where the majority of the people who live there are African American. Some of the earliest African-American neighborhoods were in New York City along with early communities located in Virginia. In 1830, there were 14,000 \\"free Negroes\\" living in New York City. The formation of black neighborhoods are closely linked to the history of segregation in the United States, either through formal laws or as a product of social norms. Despite the formal laws and segregation, black neighborhoods have played an important role in the development of African-American culture. Black residential segregation has been declining in the United States and many blacks are moving to white suburbs. Black people continue to live in poorer neighborhoods than white people and Americans of other races.https://pennstate.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/for-blacks-in- america-the-gap-in-neighborhood-poverty-has-decline History  The Great Migration  The Hub is the retail heart of the South Bronx, New York City. Between 1900 and 1930, the number of Bronx residents increased from 201,000 to 1,265,000.A Brief Look at The Bronx , Bronx Historical Society. Accessed September 23, 2007. The Great Migration was the movement of more than one million African Americans out of rural Southern United States from 1914 to 1940. Most African Americans who participated in the migration moved to large industrial cities such as New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, Cincinnati, Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, Missouri, Boston, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Minneapolis, New Orleans, Milwaukee, Oakland, and Long Beach as well as many smaller industrial cities. Hence, the Migration played an important role in the formation and expansion of African-American neighborhoods in these cities. Chicago's South Side and adjoining South Suburbs together constitute the largest geographical predominantly Black region in America, stretching from roughly Cermak Road (22nd St) on the north in the Near South Side to the far south suburb of University Park - a distance of approximately 40 miles. There are various races and ethnic groups in this huge expanse such as Whites, Latinos, Asians, and Arabs, but it is predominantly Black. While the Great Migration helped educated African Americans obtain jobs, while enabling a measure of class mobility, the migrants encountered significant forms of discrimination in the North through a large migration during such a short of period of time. The African-American migrants were often resented by working classes in the North, who feared that their ability to negotiate rates of pay, or even to secure employment at all, was threatened by the influx of new labor competition. Populations increased very rapidly with the addition of African-American migrants and new European immigrants, which caused widespread housing shortages in many cities. Newer groups competed even for the oldest and most rundown houses because the poorly constructed houses were what they could afford. African Americans competed for work and housing with first or second generation immigrants in many major cities. Ethnic groups created territories which they defended against change. More established populations with more capital moved away to newer housing that was being developed on the outskirts of the cities, to get away from the pressure of new groups of residents. The migrants also discovered that the open discrimination of the South was only more subtly manifested in the North. In 1917, the Supreme Court declared municipal resident segregation ordinances unconstitutional. In response, some white groups resorted to the restrictive covenant, a formal deed restriction binding property owners in a given neighborhood not to sell to blacks. Whites who broke these agreements could be sued by \\"damaged\\" neighbors. Not until 1948 did the Supreme Court strike down restrictive covenants. The National Housing Act of 1934 contributed to limiting the availability of loans to urban areas, particularly those areas inhabited by African Americans.' In some cities, the influx of African-American migrants as well as other immigrants resulted in racial violence, which flared in several cities during 1919. This significant event and the subsequent struggle of African-American migrants to adapt to Northern cities was the subject of Jacob Lawrence's Migration Series. This series, exhibited in 1941, was responsible for bringing Lawrence to the public eye as one of the most important African-American artists of the time.Holland Cotter, \\"Jacob Lawrence Is Dead at 82; Vivid Painter Who Chronicled Odyssey of Black Americans\\", New York Times, June 10, 2000. The Second Great Migration From 1940-1970, another five million people left the South for industrial jobs in cities of the North and West. Sometimes violence was the outcome of some of the pressure of this migration. In response to the influx of Blacks from the South, banks, insurance companies, and businesses began redlining‚Äîdenying or increasing the cost of services, such as banking, insurance, access to jobs, access to health care,See:Race and health or even supermarkets to residents in certain, often racially determined, areas. The most common use of the term refers to mortgage discrimination. Data on house prices and attitudes toward integration suggest that in the mid-20th century, segregation was a product of collective actions taken by whites to exclude blacks from their neighborhoods. This meant that ethnic minorities could secure mortgage loans only in certain areas, and it resulted in a large increase in the residential racial segregation and urban decay in the United States. Urban renewal, the redevelopment of areas within large cities, including white flight, has also been a factor in the growth patterns of African-American neighborhoods. The process began an intense phase in the late 1940s and continues in some places to the present day. It has had a major impact on the urban landscape. Urban renewal was extremely controversial because it involved the destruction of businesses, the relocation of people, and the use of eminent domain to reclaim private property for city-initiated development projects. The justifications often used for urban renewal include the \\"renewal\\" of residential slums and blighted commercial and industrial areas. In the second half of the 20th century, renewal often resulted in the creation of urban sprawl and vast areas of cities being demolished and replaced by freeways and expressways, housing projects, and vacant lots, some of which still remain vacant at the beginning of the 21st century.Bowery Bummer: Downtown Plan Will Make and Break History , J. A. Lobbia, March 17, 1999. Urban renewal had a disproportionate and largely negative impact on African-American neighborhoods. In the 1960s James Baldwin famously dubbed urban renewal \\"Negro Removal\\".The story of urban renewal: In East Liberty and elsewhere, Pittsburgh's dominant public policy tool didn't work out as planned, Sunday, May 21, 2000, By Dan Fitzpatrick, Post-Gazette Staff Writer. The creation of highways in some cases divided and isolated black neighborhoods from goods and services, many times within industrial corridors. For example, Birmingham's interstate highway system attempted to maintain racial boundaries established by the city‚Äôs 1926 racially based zoning law. The construction of interstate highways through black neighborhoods in the city led to significant population loss in those neighborhoods. It was also associated with an increase in neighborhood racial segregation.Charles E. Connerly, \\"From Racial Zoning to Community Empowerment: The Interstate Highway System and the African American Community in Birmingham, Alabama\\", Journal of Planning Education and Research, Vol. 22, No. 2, 99-114 (2002). The riots that swept cities across the country from 1964 to 1968 damaged or destroyed additional areas of major cities, for instance Detroit's 12th Street, the U and H street corridors in Washington, DC, and Harlem in New York City during the Harlem Riots. In 1968, the Civil Rights Act removed racial deed restrictions on housing. This enabled middle-class African Americans to move to better housing, in some cases in the suburbs, and to desegregated residential neighborhoods. In some areas, however, real estate agents continued to steer African Americans to particular areas although that was now illegal. Late 20th century By 1990, the legal barriers enforcing segregation had been replaced by decentralized racism, where whites pay more to live in predominantly white areas. Some social scientists suggest that the historical processes of suburbanization and decentralization are instances of white privilege that have contributed to contemporary patterns of environmental racism.Rethinking Environmental Racism: White Privilege and Urban Development in Southern California Laura Pulido Annals of the Association of American Geographers, Vol. 90, No. 1 (March 2000), pp. 12-40. At the same time, however, middle-class and upper-class blacks have also paid more to live in the suburbs and have left the inner cities of former industrial powerhouses behind. In the New Great Migration, black college graduates are returning to the South for jobs, where they generally settle in middle-class, suburban areas. This includes states such as Texas, Georgia, and Maryland, three of the biggest gaining states of college graduates.  Contemporary  Despite these pervasive patterns, many changes for individual areas are small. Thirty years after the civil rights era, the United States remains a residentially segregated society in which both blacks and whites inhabit different neighborhoods of vastly different quality.Inequality and Segregation Rajiv Sethi and Rohini Somanathan Journal of Political Economy, volume 112 (2004), pp. 1296‚Äì1321.Segregation and Stratification: A Biosocial Perspective Douglas S. Massey Du Bois Review: Social Science Research on Race (2004), 1: 7-25 Cambridge University Press Cities throughout history have contained distinct ethnic districts. But rarely have they been so isolated and impoverished as the African-American districts found in U.S. cities today.  Black middle class and white-collar areas  Due to advancements caused by the Civil Rights Movement, the social and political activism of the African- American community (religious and educational institutions), have been a strong prominent advent of the black middle class and black white-collar professionals. This has helped produce majority black populations with significant middle to upper class black neighborhoods. Many of these communities are found in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, MD and scattered around the country such as Cedar Hill, Texas, Oak Park, Michigan, and LaPlace, Louisiana. The residents of these communities are highly educated and work in white-collar professional jobs. Such communities have also developed in many of the larger cities of the United States. Even some of those that traditionally have high poverty and unemployment have also had neighborhoods with middle class and affluent blacks. Cities' policies of gentrification, the process of renovating a district so that it conforms to middle-class taste, has also played a factor.  Ghettos  Racial segregation in the United States is most pronounced in housing. Although people of different races may work together, they are still unlikely to live in largely integrated neighborhoods. This pattern differs only by degree in different metropolitan areas.The Suburban Racial Dilemma: Housing and Neighborhoods By William Dennis Keating. Temple University Press. 1994. Due to segregated conditions and widespread poverty, some black neighborhoods in the United States have been called \\"the ghetto\\" or \\"the projects.\\" The use of this term is controversial and, depending on the context, potentially offensive. Despite mainstream America‚Äôs use of the term \\"ghetto\\" to signify a poor urban area (predominantly African-Americans), those living in the area often used it to signify something positive. The black ghettos did not always contain dilapidated houses and deteriorating projects, nor were all of its residents poverty-stricken. For many African Americans, the ghetto was \\"home\\", a place representing authentic blackness and a feeling, passion, or emotion derived from the rising above the struggle and suffering of being black in America.Smitherman, Geneva. Black Talk: Words and Phrases from the Hood to the Amen Corner. New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2000. Langston Hughes relays in the \\"Negro Ghetto\\" (1931) and \\"The Heart of Harlem\\" (1945): \\"The buildings in Harlem are brick and stone/And the streets are long and wide,/But Harlem‚Äôs much more than these alone,/Harlem is what‚Äôs inside.\\" Playwright August Wilson used the term \\"ghetto\\" in Ma Rainey‚Äôs Black Bottom (1984) and Fences (1987), both of which draw upon the author‚Äôs experience growing up in the Hill District of Pittsburgh, first a neighborhood of early European immigrants, then a black ghetto.GHETTO Kim Pearson Depending on the context and social circles, the term 'ghetto' or 'hood (short for neighborhood) can be a term of endearment for where the individual person has been brought up or lives. Institutions within black neighborhoods Although some black neighborhoods may suffer from civic disinvestment,Root shock: The consequences of African American dispossession Journal of Urban Health. Springer New York. Volume 78, Number 1 / March, 2001 with schools assumed to be of lower quality due to some schools showing lower test scores, less effective policingThe Neighborhood Context of Police Behavior Douglas A. Smith Crime and Justice, Vol. 8, Communities and Crime (1986), pp. 313-341 and fire protection, there are institutions that help to improve the physical and social capital of black neighborhoods. And with the social mobility of many African Americans, there has been the rise of many communities with better schools and safe neighborhoods. But these issues may be more due to economics than race since middle class blacks with middle-class neighborhoods tend to live in better neighborhoods and children attend better schools than those from lower income neighborhoods or schools districts. Churches In black neighborhoods the churches have been important sources of social cohesion and activism.Church Culture as a Strategy of Action in the Black Community Mary Pattillo-McCoy American Sociological Review, Vol. 63, No. 6 (Dec., 1998), pp. 767-784 For some African Americans, the kind of spirituality learned through these churches works as a protective factor against the corrosive forces of racism.\\"Gathering the Spirit\\" at First Baptist Church: Spirituality as a Protective Factor in the Lives of African American Children by Wendy L. Haight; Social Work, Vol. 43, 1998 Churches may also do work to improve the physical infrastructure of the neighborhood. Churches in Harlem have undertaken real estate ventures and renovated burnt-out and abandoned brownstones to create new housing for residents. Churches have fought for the right to operate their own schools in place of the often inadequate public schools found in many black neighborhoods.A Harlem Church Sues to Operate Charter School by Azi Paybarah Published: October 25, 2007 Museums DuSable Museum, Washington Park, Chicago. The African American Museum Movement emerged during the 1950s and 1960s to preserve the heritage of the black experience and to ensure its proper interpretation in American history.African American Museums Association: History Museums devoted to African American history are found in many black neighborhoods. Institutions such as the African American Museum and Library at Oakland, the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History in Detroit, and The African American Museum in Cleveland were created by African Americans to teach and investigate cultural history that, until recent decades was primarily preserved through oral traditions.African-American Museums, History, and the American Ideal by John E. Fleming The Journal of American History, Vol. 81, No. 3, The Practice of American History: A Special Issue (Dec., 1994), pp. 1020-1026 Theatre and arts Major movements in literature, music, and the arts have their roots in African American neighborhoods: Blues, Gospel, Jazz, Soul, Rap, House, Hip hop, Rock 'n' roll and others. Cities were the places where young artists could meet and study with other artists and receive recognition, as did Jacob Lawrence when his \\"Migration Series\\" was featured by the Museum of Modern Art in New York when he was still in his 20s. African American neighborhoods have also generated African American theater and numerous dance companies in a variety of styles. After his career as a classical ballet dancer with the New York City Ballet, Arthur Mitchell founded a school and dance company in Harlem. Alvin Ailey created dances out of the African American experience with his Alvin Ailey Dance Company. Chicago stepping is a name given to a dance that was created in Chicago's predominantly African American neighborhoods. House music, a form of Electronic Dance Music was first developed in Chicago in the early 1980s. By the 1990s, it had spread both nationally and globally. Hip hop is both a cultural movement and a music genre developed in New York City starting in the late 1970s predominantly by African Americans.The Resource - THE NEXT Since first emerging in the South Bronx and Bedford- Stuyvesant, the lifestyle of rap/hip hop has spread globally. Newspapers The historic office of the Omaha Star, an African American newspaper. Many African American neighborhoods produce their own newspapers, including the South Fulton Neighbor in Atlanta, the Capitol Update in Tallahassee, and the Star in Omaha. Education Lincoln Academy was the first school for African Americans in Tallahassee, Florida. Segregation in schools and universities led to the creation of many Black schools. Public elementary, junior and senior high schools across the United States during the period of legal segregation. Students that attended this school went through either vocational classes or regular high school. This school offered several vocational such as cosmetology, tailoring and welding. Festivals and holidays Southwest Center City in Philadelphia, the largest gathering of African Americans on the East Coast of the United States. In the U.S. city of Philadelphia, the Odunde Festival (also known as \\"African New Year\\") claims to be the largest gathering of African Americans that happens annually on the second Sunday of June in the Southwest Center City section of town. Also, the District of Columbia celebrates April 16 as Emancipation Day as a public holiday, which is an observance of the emancipation of slaves of African origin. Built environment Bedford-Stuyvesant brownstones. Many African American neighborhoods are located in inner cities or are a part of an urban center. These are the mostly residential neighborhoods located closest to the central business district. The built environment is often 19th- and early 20th-century row houses or brownstones, mixed with older single-family homes that may be converted to multifamily homes. In some areas there are larger apartment buildings. Shotgun houses are an important part of the built environment of some southern African American neighborhoods. The houses consist of three to five rooms in a row with no hallways. This African American house design is found in both rural and urban southern areas, mainly in African-American communities and neighborhoods (especially in New Orleans).Black architecture still standing, the Shotgun House! The Great Buildings Collection on CD-ROM Kevin Matthews The term \\"shotgun house,\\" is often said to come from the saying that one could fire a shotgun through the front door and the pellets would fly cleanly through the house and out the back door. However, the name's origin may actually reflect an African architectural heritage, perhaps being a corruption of a term such as to-gun, which means \\"place of assembly\\" in the Southern Dohomey Fon area. During the periods of population decline and urban decay in the 1970s and 1980s, many African American neighborhoods, like other urban minority neighborhoods, turned abandoned lots into community gardens. Community gardens serve social and economic functions,Urban Community Gardens as Contested Space Karen Schmelzkopf Geographical Review, Vol. 85, No. 3 (Jul., 1995), pp. 364-381A survey of community gardens in upstate New York: Implications for health promotion and community development Health & Place Volume 6, Issue 4, 1 December 2000, Pages 319-327 providing safe, open spaces in areas with few parks.

After giving some violin recitals he concentrated on viola. Charles Warwick Evans (1885‚Äì1974) had studied for 6 years at the Royal College of Music and became principal cello in the Beecham Opera Company, then leading cello in the Queen's Hall Orchestra. He resigned that post to devote himself to the String Quartet. In 1908 Warwick-Evans was leader of the Queen's Hall violoncellos and Waldo Warner was first viola in the New Symphony Orchestra. Warwick-Evans formed the idea of a string quartet worked up to the standard of a solo virtuoso, and approached Waldo Warner.The primary source for this section is the lengthy and useful article 'British Players and Singers ‚Äì vii: The London String Quartet, Musical Times 1 August 1922. (See external link). He was enthusiastic, and then Petre was found and finally Albert Sammons, the new Concertmaster of Thomas Beecham's orchestra, to lead the quartet. They rehearsed four times a week for nearly two years before giving their first concert. There was to be no 'boss': if anyone disagreed with tempo or phrasing he spoke out, the point was discussed, and the decision made if necessary by voting. The first concert was on 26 January 1910, at Bechstein (Wigmore) Hall, as the 'New' Quartet, playing Dohnanyi in D flat, Tchaikovsky in D, and a Fantasy Quartet (No. i) of Waldo Warner's. Reviews were excellent: the second concert was in June 1910, of Debussy in G minor, Beethoven Op. 59 no. 1, and a Fantasy of Balfour Gardiner's. Warwick-Evans suggested the name 'London String Quartet' and in 1911 it was adopted.Frank Forman, op. cit. At the outbreak of war, 1914, Warwick-Evans and Waldo Warner could not serve for health reasons. Petre served in France and his place was taken successively by Wynn Reeves, Herbert Kinsey, and Edwin Virgo. Albert Sammons, meanwhile, was building a solo career and had less time for essential rehearsals. In May 1915 the quartet began to give chamber music 'Pops', much liked in wartime London. By May 1917 they had given 50, and at about that time Sammons left and was replaced (July 1917) by James Levey, a pupil of Ferdinand Hill's. The last of these concerts, the 117th, was on 14 July 1919. In 1920 the suggestion was made that they should perform a one-week cycle of the complete Beethoven quartets, and this was done first in Edinburgh, then in London, then Stockholm, Christiania, and variously in America, in all ten cycles including three in London. In September 1920 they were introduced to America by Mrs Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge at Pittsburgh, playing Frank Bridge's E minor (Bologna) Quartet, Beethoven in E minor, and Waldo Warner's Folk-song Fantasy. In addition to a great number of concerts in London and England they undertook many international tours, notably to America, France, Portugal, Spain (twice), Scandinavia (thrice), (Germany) and Canada. From November 1922 to April 1924 they conducted a world-tour. Their prestige in America, North and South, was very considerable, and they travelled from Canada to Buenos Aires, performing much new music as well as Beethoven quartet cycles. By the late 1920s they had introduced around one hundred new pieces of music to the repertory. Their disbanding, in November 1934, was prompted by John Pennington having been appointed to the concertmaster's chair in San Francisco. Thereafter all but violist Primrose ‚Äì who joined Toscanini's NBC Symphony Orchestra as co-principal ‚Äì moved to Hollywood studios. In 1941 the quartet reformed for concerts in Los Angeles and performed at summer concerts and other recitals. Primrose pursued his distinguished career as a soloist and was replaced by Cecil Bonvalot, and subsequently Edgardo Acosta. The quartet formally disbanded in 1952. The quartet was one of the most important international groups of its time. Numerous premieres, Beethoven cycles, widespread concertising, and eminent recordings marked out its trajectory. The 'live' Library of Congress recordings demonstrate its most vital, sensitive and convincing musicianship in ways that even its studio discs occasionally fail to show. They provide irrefutable evidence that the quartet was one of the very greatest of its time. Irving Kolodin wrote: > 'In the Flonzaley's later years,... they seemed to have become a committee > of experts matching exquisite swatches of tonal texture rather than > performers of music. For young ears, the rise of the London String Quartet > (with the incomparable James Levey as leader, and the enduring partnership > of Thomas Petre, H. Waldo Warner and C. Warwick Evans participating) dimmed > the Flonzaley star even as it was waning. A more vibrant enthusiasm, a > stronger sense of tonal colours, a refinement that was not raffin√©, gave > them pre-eminence as long as this personnel endured. This, in truth, was not > long, and though Levey's successor was John Pennington of the honeyed tone, > and William Primrose first showed his prowess as a violist in Waldo Warner's > place, it was not the same thing.'Irving Kolodin, The Musical Life > (Gollancz, London 1959), 63. As live Library of Congress recordings irrefutably demonstrate, Kolodin's implication that the Levey-led quartet declined when Pennington and Primrose took their places in the ensemble is very much wide of the mark. Harry Waldo Warner won distinction as a composer of chamber music, including six published string quartets and a trio. The first two quartets were one-movement works described as Phantasies for the purposes of the Cobbett Prize, which was won by both. The third in C minor is in four movements, though the slow movement and scherzo are linked: the fourth is a Phantasy based on an English folk- song, with many variations. The fifth is a Suite called 'The Pixy Ring', each movement being concerned with fairy lore, and the sixth is a Suite of four movements described as being in the 'Olden Style'.Bruno Aulich and Ernst Heimeran, The Well-Tempered String Quartet (Translation by D Millar Craig), Revised enlarged edition (Novello, Sevenoaks 1951), p.125). Recordings The group made prolific early recordings in the days of the pre-electric recording horn, when it was difficult to obtain clear sound from string chamber groups. The 1917 premiere recording (made in this way) of the Vaughan Williams song- cycle On Wenlock Edge, with Gervase Elwes (tenor) and Frederick B. Kiddle (piano) is deservedly famous, and has James Levey as first violin (Columbia Records, Purple label, 7363‚Äì7365). This remained in the catalogue until at least 1933.

CCR8 has also recently been designated CDw198 (cluster of differentiation w198).  Function  This gene encodes a member of the beta chemokine receptor family, which is predicted to be a seven transmembrane protein similar to G protein-coupled receptors. Chemokines and their receptors are important for the migration of various cell types into the inflammatory sites. This receptor protein preferentially expresses in the thymus. The ligand of the CCR8 is CCL1. CCL8 also functions as a CCR8 agonist. Studies of this receptor and its ligands suggested its role in regulation of monocyte chemotaxis and thymic cell apoptosis. More specifically, this receptor may contribute to the proper positioning of activated T cells within the antigenic challenge sites and specialized areas of lymphoid tissues.

The film, set in Tangier in a three-day period, tells the story of three young friends taking critical decisions about their uncertain future. Plot For the past few years, Serge, a young French man, has been working as a long distance truck driver, employed by a company that ships goods from Morocco to Europe. His job gives him plenty of time for reflection and boredom. In Algeciras, ready to make his next trip to Africa, Serge succumbs to the criminal subculture, dangerously agreeing to smuggle hashish from Morocco to Europe hiding the illegal drugs in his truck. This time, the Moroccan stopover between transports of cargoes will last three days. In Tangier, while he waits for his truck to be loaded and pass customs, Serge is reunited with his friend Sa√Ød. Sa√Ød, a young Moroccan whose only possession is his bicycle, desperately seeks to escape his restricted background and avidly longs for the possibility and intrigue of life beyond Africa, but he has attempted his illegal immigration many times before with dire consequences. Serge who is eager to see his on and off girlfriend Sarah, Sa√Ød‚Äôs friend and employer, strikes a deal with Sa√Ød. If Sa√Ød can convince Sarah to see him again, Serge promises to smuggle Sa√Ød to Europe. Sa√Ød takes Serge to see his and Sara‚Äôs friends: Jack, a gay American √©migr√© living happily in Morocco, and Fran√ßois, a young film director preparing a documentary on illegal immigration. Fran√ßois and Serge went to the same school eight years ago. Sa√Ød entices Sarah, to go out that night in order to prepare and encounter with Serge. When she first see him again she runs away, but ultimately she yields and they get back together. Sarah, a beautiful, independent young Jewish woman mourning her recently dead mother operates a small hotel, where Sa√Ød works. She is in a disjunctive of her own. Her successful brother, a Canadian √©migr√©, wants her to leave Morocco and join him in Montreal. She agonizes over the decision, unsure about emigrating. Serge's return and their complicated relationship just make harder to make a decision. Emily, Sarah‚Äôs sister in law, a writer who recently has lost a son, arrives to help her close the hotel and resettle in Canada. The closing of the hotel leaves Sa√Ød without a job and intensifies his need to try to pass to Europe. However, Serge backs off with his part of the plan to take Sa√Ød in his truck to Spain. Angry, Sa√Ød breaks his friendship with Serge and tries to indispose Sarah against Serge. With money that Sarah gives Sa√Ød for the loss of his job, he goes to a seedy neighborhood with Fran√ßois, who is attracted to Sa√Ød, but trying to change the local currency to pesetas, he is robbed and loses his bicycle in the process. In contrast to Sarah and Sa√Ød their friend Farida, an independent optician who has recently divorce her husband, is very attached to Morocco and would never consider emigrating. The group of friends have a picnic during which Farida has to be rushed to the hospital to give birth. The party of friends invited by Fran√ßois goes to see Jean Renoir‚Äôs The River. At the end Serge ends empty handed, he neither gets any money from his attempt at smuggling drugs nor has he certainty in his relationship with Sarah who still can't make up her mind of either leaving or staying in Tangier. Sa√Ød, has little to lose and goes to the port and hides beneath Serge‚Äôs truck. He is found by Serge who sneaks him inside the truck‚Äôs cabin. Together they are on the road to Europe.

The slightly patchy video image contributes to the sense of collapse and unease. The film is set in Tangier and is told in three \\"movements\\"; the sections marked by chapters. T√©chin√© renders the confusion and desperation occasioned by the three leads personal dilemmas into a larger canvas of cultural dislocation, identity and friendship. In moving between the stories of his three principal actors, T√©chin√© establishes both an emotional immediacy and painful confusion that captures the intensity of feeling between them, addressing some of the director's trademark themes: family relations, irreconcilable sexual entanglements and the allure of criminal activity. T√©chin√©, examines the relationships between these three very independent twenty something, showing how their various desires in life conflict because of citizenship, employment, class differences, as well as personal outlook The film generally concerns Moroccans with various relationships with the country: visiting staying, leaving and contemplating. Techin√©'s captures the complexity of the emotions that join his star-crossed lovers. He balances their love story against the serious backdrop of smuggling and immigration.

On 7 August 1907 (one source states it occurred on 6 AugustGardiner & Gray, p. 17) she collided with the destroyer , badly damaging Quails bow.Lyon, p. 100 The following year, on 27 April 1908, Attentive was involved in a series of accidents during a live-firing exercise at night with the Eastern Destroyer Flotilla. She accidentally rammed and sank the destroyer , killing one crewman. The hapless Attentive then collided with the destroyer , holing her hull. After repairs she was recommissioned at Chatham in July 1909 and became leader of the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla, then joined the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla in 1910. About 1911‚Äì1912, her main guns were replaced by nine guns, arranged four on each broadside and the remaining gun on the quarterdeck.McBride, p. 274 After refit in August 1912 at HM Dockyard, Devonport, Attentive was assigned to the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron in 1913 for the annual manoeuvres and was then transferred to lead the 9th Destroyer Flotilla at Portsmouth. The ship joined the 6th Destroyer Flotilla at Dover later that year. She spent most of the First World War as part of the Dover Patrol.Morris, p. 112 On 7 September 1915 she became an early victim of air power. While supporting a naval bombardment of German positions at Ostend, Attentive was bombed, suffering eight casualties. The air attack forced the squadron to briefly disperse, before returning to carry out the bombardment.Bacon, p. 86 Attentive screened the raiding force during the Zeebrugge Raid on 25 April 1918 and recovered part of the ship's crew of the concrete-filled cruiser after she had detonated her demolition charges.McGreal, p. 108 Later that year the ship began escorting convoys to Gibraltar. She spent a few months off Murmansk, North Russia, supporting British forces intervening in the Russian Civil War.

She spent her early career as flagship for the East Indies and North America and West Indies Stations. She was reduced to reserve in 1908 before again becoming the flagship in the East Indies in 1911. She returned home two years later and became a training ship. When World War I began in August 1914, she was assigned to the 9th Cruiser Squadron in the Central Atlantic to intercept German commerce raiders and protect Allied shipping. Days after the war began, she intercepted a Dutch ship carrying German troops and gold. She then sank the German armed merchant cruiser SMS Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse off the coast of Spanish Sahara. Highflyer spent most of the rest of the war on convoy escort duties and was present in Halifax during the Halifax Explosion in late 1917. She became flagship of the East Indies Station after the war. The ship was sold for scrap in 1921. Design and description The two 6-inch guns on her sister ship Hermess quarterdeck Highflyer was designed to displace . The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by two 4-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, which produced a total of designed to give a maximum speed of . Highflyer reached a speed of from , during her sea trials. The engines were powered by 18 Belleville boilers.Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 79 She carried a maximum of of coal and her complement consisted of 470 officers and enlisted men.Friedman 2012, p. 336 Her main armament consisted of 11 quick-firing (QF) Mk I guns.Friedman 2011, p. 87 One gun was mounted on the forecastle and two others were positioned on the quarterdeck. The remaining eight guns were placed port and starboard amidships.Friedman 2012, p. 171 They had a maximum range of approximately with their shells.Friedman 2011, pp. 87‚Äì88 Eight quick-firing (QF) 12-pounder 12 cwt guns were fitted for defence against torpedo boats. One additional 12-pounder 8 cwt gun could be dismounted for service ashore. Highflyer also carried six 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns and two submerged 18-inch torpedo tubes. The ship's protective deck armour ranged in thickness from . The engine hatches were protected by of armour. The main guns were fitted with 3-inch gun shields and the conning tower had armour 6 inches thick. Construction and service Highflyer was laid down by Fairfield Shipbuilding & Engineering at their shipyard in Govan, Scotland on 7 June 1897, and launched on 4 June 1898, when she was christened by Mrs. Elgar, wife of Francis Elgar, a director of the shipbuilding company, who held a speech. She was completed on 7 December 1899 and commissioned by Captain Frederic Brock for the Training squadron. In February 1900 she was re- commissioned to serve in the Indian Ocean as the flagship of Rear-Admiral Day Bosanquet, the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, at Trincomalee. Captain Arthur Christian was appointed in command of the ship in June 1902, as Flag captain to Rear-Admiral Charles Carter Drury, who succeeded Bosanquet as Commander-in- Chief of the Station. She was at Mauritius in August 1902 where she took part in local celebrations for the Coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, and in November that year visited Colombo. She was transferred to the North America and West Indies Station in 1904 and served as its flagship until November 1906 when returned to the East Indies Station. Highflyer was placed in reserve at Devonport Royal Dockyard in 1908 and then assigned to the reserve Third Fleet in 1910. She was again assigned as the flagship of the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, in February 1911 until departing for home in April 1913. In August 1913 she became the training ship for Special Entry Cadets.Friedman 2012, p. 170; Gardiner & Gray, p. 13 In August 1914 she was allocated to the 9th Cruiser Squadron, under Rear Admiral John de Robeck, on the Finisterre station.

She was also carrying about 150 German reservists in steerage and a cargo of grain destined for Germany. She was stopped and boarded by an officer and crewmen from Highflyer, and escorted into port at Plymouth. She was then transferred to the Cape Verde station, to support Rear Admiral Archibald Stoddart's 5th Cruiser Squadron in the hunt for the German armed merchant cruiser . She had been sighted at R√≠o de Oro, a Spanish anchorage on the Saharan coast. On 26 August Highflyer found the German ship taking on coal from three colliers. Highflyer's captain demanded that the Germans surrender. The captain of Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse claimed the protection of neutral waters, but as he was breaking that neutrality himself by staying for more than a week, his claim was denied. Fighting broke out at 15:10, and lasted until 16:45, when the crew of Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse abandoned ship and escaped to the shore. The German ship was sunk, with the British losing one man killed (Richard James Lobb) and five injured in the engagement.Corbett, Vol. I, pp. 134‚Äì35 In mid-1916 the Prize Court awarded the crew of Highflyer ¬£2,680 for the sinking of the German ship. On 15 October Highflyer briefly became the flagship of the Cape Verde station, when Stoddard was ordered to Pernambuco, Brazil. Later in the same month she was ordered to accompany the transport ships carrying the Cape garrison back to Britain and then searched the Atlantic coast of North Africa for the German light cruiser . After the Battle of Coronel in November, Highflyer came back under the control of Admiral de Robeck, as part of a squadron formed to guard West Africa against Admiral Maximilian von Spee. This squadron, consisting of the cruisers , , and Highflyer was in place off Sierra Leone from 12 November, but was soon dispersed after the battle of the Falklands in December.Corbett, Vol. I, pp. 329, 365, 371 Highflyer then took part in the search for the commerce raider , coming close to catching her in January 1915.Corbett, Vol. II, pp. 245, 252‚Äì53 She remained on the West Africa station until she was transferred to the North America and West Indies Squadron in 1917.Friedman 2012, p. 170 This was the period of unrestricted submarine warfare, and the Admiralty eventually decided to operate a convoy system in the North Atlantic.

The first bull by that name was issued in about 1120 by Calixtus II and served as a papal charter of protection to Jews. It was prompted by attacks on Jews by the First Crusade, during which over five thousand Jews were slaughtered in Europe. The bull forbade Christians, on pain of excommunication, from forcing Jews to convert, from harming them, from taking their property, from disturbing the celebration of their festivals, and from interfering with their cemeteries. Following further attacks, further bulls by many popes reaffirmed the doctrine, including Alexander III, Celestine III (1191-1198), Innocent III (1199), Honorius III (1216), Gregory IX (1235), Innocent IV (1246), Alexander IV (1255), Urban IV (1262), Gregory X (1272 & 1274), Nicholas III, Martin IV (1281), Honorius IV (1285-1287), Nicholas IV (1288-92), Clement VI (1348), Urban V (1365), Boniface IX (1389), Martin V (1422), and Nicholas V (1447).Deutsch, Gotthard; Jacobs, Joseph (1906). \\"The Popes\\" in The Jewish Encyclopedia, KTAV Publishing, New York.

Church attitude to treatment of Jews  The Church‚Äôs stated attitude against the mistreatment of Jews goes back to the early Church. Around 400, St Augustine, one of the most influential and foundational figures of Catholic theology, preached that the Jews must be protected for their ability to explain the Old Testament. The words sicut Judaeis (\\"As the Jews\\") were first used by Pope Gregory I (590-604) in a letter addressed to the Bishop of Naples. Around 598, in reaction to anti-Jewish attacks by Christians in Palermo, Pope Gregory brought Augustine's teachings into Roman Law. He published a bull which became the foundation of Catholic doctrine in relation to the Jews and specified that, although the Jews had not accepted salvation through Christ, and were therefore condemned by God until such time as they accept salvation, Christians were nevertheless duty-bound to protect the Jews as an important part of Christian civilization.Lecture by Dr David Neiman: The Church and the Jews II: Popes Gregory I and Leo III; published by iTunes, 2009 The Pope emphasized that Jews were entitled to \\"enjoy their lawful liberty.\\"Thurston, Herbert (1912). \\"History of Toleration\\" in The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 14. New York: Robert Appleton Company. Accessed 12 July 2013. The Bull said that Jews should be treated equitably and justly, that their property rights should be protected, and that they should keep their own festivals and religious practices.Catholic Encyclopedia - History of Toleration; web 22 June 2013 In 1065, Pope Alexander II wrote to B√©ranger, Viscount of Narbonne, and to Guifred, bishop of the city, praising them for having prevented the massacre of the Jews in their district, and reminding them that God does not approve of the shedding of blood. In 1065 also, Alexander admonished Landulf VI of Benevento \\"that the conversion of Jews is not to be obtained by force.\\"Simonsohn, pp 35-37. Despite the position expressed in the Sicut Judaeis, the Church imposed restrictions on Jews. For example, the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215 decreed that Jews be differentiated from others by their type of clothing to avoid intercourse between Jews and Christians. Jews were sometimes required to wear a yellow badge or a pointed hat. The imposition of exorbitant taxes on Jews were widespread, and practice of expelling Jews, usually after stripping them of their property through taxation, was also widespread. For example, in 1229, King Henry III of England forced Jews to pay half the value of their property in taxes, which was followed by further taxation and then by the expulsion of Jews from England in 1290. Jews were also expelled from France, Spain, and Portugal. Extracts from the bull Jews studying in a synagogue, c.1483 Pope Alexander III (1159-1181) is the author of the oldest extant version of the bull. Excerpts from a translation of the bull follow: :\\"[The Jews] ought to suffer no prejudice. We, out of the meekness of Christian piety, and in keeping in the footprints of Our predecessors of happy memory, the Roman Pontiffs Calixtus, Eugene, Alexander, Clement, admit their petition, and We grant them the buckler of Our protection. :For We make the law that no Christian compel them, unwilling or refusing, by violence to come to baptism. But, if any one of them should spontaneously, and for the sake of the faith, fly to the Christians, once his choice has become evident, let him be made a Christian without any calumny. Indeed, he is not considered to possess the true faith of Christianity who is not recognized to have come to Christian baptism, not spontaneously, but unwillingly. :Too, no Christian ought to presume...to injure their persons, or with violence to take their property, or to change the good customs which they have had until now in whatever region they inhabit. :Besides, in the celebration of their own festivities, no one ought disturb them in any way, with clubs or stones, nor ought any one try to require from them or to extort from them services they do not owe, except for those they have been accustomed from times past to perform. :...We decree... that no one ought to dare mutilate or diminish a Jewish cemetery, nor, in order to get money, to exhume bodies once they have been buried. :If anyone, however, shall attempt, the tenor of this decree once known, to go against it...let him be punished by the vengeance of excommunication, unless he correct his presumption by making equivalent satisfaction.\\"Synan, Edward.

It is loosely based on the novel Columbus by Rafael Sabatini with much of the screenplay rewritten by Sydney and Muriel Box.Spicer p.127-128 Plot Christopher Columbus, an explorer from Genoa, Italy, arrives in Spain with his son seeking funds for a trip to India. He obtains an introduction at court from Father Perez, the former confessor for Queens Isabella. Columbus is opposed b Francisco de Bobadilla, who uses Beatriz to distract Columbus, However eventually the Queen agrees to finance Columbus's ships, the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria, on its journey. On the trip over, the crew threaten mutiny. Columbus promises to turn back if no land is found in three days. On the third night, Columbus sees a light and they reach the New World. Columbus returns to Spain a hero but continues to face opposition at court, even has his discoveries help turn Spain into a rich country.

In September 1946 Box announced he would make the film from Sabatini's novel for the United Kingdom Moving Picture Company. Finance would come from the Rank Organisation. The film was part of a deliberate attempt by Rank to break into the American market, following the path blazed with films like Henry V (1944) and Caesar and Cleopatra (1945). John Woolf, head of international distribution for Rank, said in October 1946 that: > Before we smacked Henry V and Caesar and Cleopatra into the American > Markets, we were getting a poor showing in the United States. Although the > most optimistic figures have been put out in London about the achievements > of Henry and Caesar, in fact they have had to fight hard to make their way. > The important thing to remember is this‚Äî that these big films enabled us to > break through the highly controlled theatre circuits in America. We are > using them as a spearhead to get a showing of British films. For a time it seemed there would be a rival movie on the same subject produced by Edward Small from a biography by David Lawrence. This film was not made. When Box became head of Gainsborough Pictures he immediately put the project in development at that studio. In January 1947 Sabatini was reportedly working on the script. Casting In October 1946 Box said he wanted a young, virile actor to play the lead. Stewart Granger was originally mentioned. In January 1947 Arturo de C√≥rdova was announced as star. In August 1947 Sydney Box arrived in Hollywood to sign a star. He met with James Mason. Then in September he announced he had signed Fredric March and Florence Eldridge to play the leads. \\"It's a great part\\", said March. Shooting March arrived in England in April 1948 for what was meant to be a five-month shoot. Studio filming took place at Pinewood and there was location filming in Barbados. March had recently had an operation and suffered a relapse while in London. Two ships, replicas of the Nina and Santa Maria were built especially for the film and in April 1948 they were shipped from Spain to London. Shooting was often difficult. The replica of the Santa Maria broke its moorings during a squall in the West Indies and drifted for two nights and a day with people on board before it was rescued. Then a fire broke out and the ship was burnt. It had to be rebuilt at a cost of ¬£100,000 because scenes set on it had yet to be shot. March collapsed one day due to heatstroke. Reshoots A new subplot was added towards the end of shooting involving the romance between Columbus and the sister (Kathleen Ryan) of his lieutenant (Derek Bond). March was reportedly very disappointed with the final film. The Francoist Spanish government considered the portrait of Columbus to be unflattering. In response the leading Spanish studio CIFESA produced Dawn of America (1951), which portrayed Columbus as a more daring figure. Reception Critical The New York Times called it \\"largely an uninspired succession of legendary but lifeless episodes.\\" Box Office In April 1949 J. Arthur Rank told Hedda Hopper he thought the film would be his most successful of 1949. However the film failed to recoup its enormous cost at the box office.

Accessed June 25, 2018 Gameplay 250px The objective is to save all of the bugs rolling round the screen, before they reach the opening to the Black Bug Empire's underground lair. When one bug reaches the opening, the player loses a life and the other bugs in the line quickly rush underground. The player can save the bugs by firing a coloured bug from Tumble's back towards a group of two or more of the same coloured balls. When three or more of the same colour come in contact with each other, they are set free, possibly triggering other bugs to escape as part of a chain reaction. Occasionally, Powerup indicators will appear on bugs in the queue. If you complete the group while the Powerup is active, you'll collect that Powerup. If you don't collect it, the Powerup will flash quickly, and eventually disappear. Game modes Tumblebugs has a choice of Story Mode or Time Trial Mode. In Story Mode there are four backyards where the Black Bugs have taken control, and a total of 12 levels. The level selection screen shows all of the levels you've unlocked so far. Each round is numbered to show where you are up to. For example, if you're on 3‚Äì2, this is the second round on level 3. Time Trial Mode is a test to see how long you can last on your favourite map, while the difficulty is gradually increased. You can choose from all of the maps you've already unlocked in Story Mode - as you progress through Story Mode new maps will unlock in Time Trial Mode. Powerups * Rewind: The Tumblebugs are briefly able to push back against their captors and move away from the lair. * Fast Forward: Bugs move more quickly toward the lair, but 500 points is scored which can help a great deal with reaching 100% complete. This powerup did not appear in Tumblebugs 2. * Stop: The bugs stop moving forward briefly, making shots easier. * Ballistic Bugs: For a limited time, you can launch bugs right over the top of the queue to reach the bugs at the rear which were impossible to get to before. * Wild Bugs: These multi-colored bugs match with any color they touch, even two at once! * Star Bug: Can bust through several lines of bugs, freeing each one it comes into contact with. Very useful for collecting other powerups! * Blossom Bug: Bugs are freed all at once in a circle around the powerup. * Color Burst: In a circle surrounding the powerup, bugs are all changed to the same color. * E-X-T-R-A Letters: Collect all of the letters to spell out the word EXTRA to be awarded an extra life. iOS Version The iOS versions of the game (the iPad version was called Tumblebugs HD) were released to the Apple App Store on July 9, 2012.

It was proposed by John Denis Sargan in 1958, and several variants were derived by him in 1975. Lars Peter Hansen re-worked through the derivations and showed that it can be extended to general non-linear GMM in a time series context. The Sargan test is based on the assumption that model parameters are identified via a priori restrictions on the coefficients, and tests the validity of over- identifying restrictions. The test statistic can be computed from residuals from instrumental variables regression by constructing a quadratic form based on the cross-product of the residuals and exogenous variables. Under the null hypothesis that the over-identifying restrictions are valid, the statistic is asymptotically distributed as a chi-square variable with (m - k) degrees of freedom (where m is the number of instruments and k is the number of endogenous variables). This version of the Sargan statistic was developed for models estimated using instrumental variables from ordinary time series or cross-sectional data. When longitudinal (\\"panel data\\") data are available, it is possible to extend such statistics for testing exogeneity hypotheses for subsets of explanatory variables. Testing of over-identifying assumptions is less important in longitudinal applications because realizations of time varying explanatory variables in different time periods are potential instruments, i.e., over-identifying restrictions are automatically built into models estimated using longitudinal data.

In it, Barton presents Jesus as \\"[t]he Founder of Modern Business,\\" in an effort to make the Christian story accessible to businessmen of the time. When published in 1925, The Man Nobody Knows topped the nonfiction bestseller list, and was one of the best-selling non-fiction books of the 20th century. Synopsis In this book, Barton paints a picture of a strong Jesus, who worked with his hands, slept outdoors, and travelled on foot. This is very different from what he saw as the \\"Sunday School Jesus\\" ‚Äî a physically weak, moralistic man, and the \\"lamb of God\\". Barton describes Jesus as \\"the world's greatest business executive\\", and according to one of the chapter headings, \\"The Founder of Modern Business\\", who created a world-conquering organization with a group of twelve men hand- picked from the bottom ranks of business. Controversy Having completed the book in 1924, Barton initially experienced difficulty getting his work published, as the material was considered to be controversial. It was simply seen by some as wrong to compare Jesus to ordinary men. Since its publication, The Man Nobody Knows has divided readers. Some welcome the portrayal of Jesus as a strong character, whom no one dared oppose, and praise the use of familiar stereotypes to stimulate interest in religion, whilst others ridicule the suggestion that Jesus was a salesman. Critics have suggested that The Man Nobody Knows is a prime example of the materialism and \\"glorified Rotarianism\\" of the Protestant churches in the 1920s. It was suggested that the book was written as \\"an apology for big business\\"; however, in his 2005 biography of Barton, The Man Everybody Knew: Bruce Barton and the Making of Modern America, Richard M.

Life Case was born between 1539 and 1546 at Woodstock, Oxfordshire, and was a chorister at New College and Christ Church, Oxford. He was elected to a scholarship at St. John's in 1564. He was B.A. in 1568, M.A. in 1572, and became a fellow of his college. He had a high reputation as a disputant. Being \\"popishly affected,\\" says Anthony Wood, he \\"left his fellowship and married\\" in 1574. His wife was Elizabeth Dobson, the widow of John Dobson, the keeper of Bocardo prison. Case's stepdaughter Anne Dobson married Regius Professor of Medicine (Oxford) Bartholomew Warner. Case obtained leave from the university to read logic and philosophy to young men, chiefly Roman Catholics, in his own house in Oxford; it became a largely attended philosophical school due to Case's reputation as a logician and dialectician. Among his pupils was Edward Weston. He wrote various handbooks for his students' use, which were published and for a time popular, though they had fallen into disrepute in Wood's day. He is described as \\"a man of an innocent, meek, religious and studious life,\\" an agreeable conversationalist, an enthusiastic teacher, and a great favourite with his pupils. He was in addition an authority on music and a distinguished physician, becoming M.D. in 1589. Case made money in the practice of medicine and left various sums to St. John's College, New College, and the poor of Woodstock. In 1589 he became Canon of Sarum. He died on 23 January 1599 ‚Äì 1600 and was buried in the chapel of St. John's College. His portrait is in the Bodleian Library. Works Title page of John Case's Sphaera Civitatis (1588)Most of Case's works were commentaries on various treatises of Aristotle (Organon, Nicomachean Ethics, Politics, Economics, Physics) under curious titles; they enjoyed a large circulation during his time, and were frequently reprinted. His works include Summa veterum interpretum in universam dialecticam Aristotelis (1584, on the Organon) and Speculum moralium quaestionium in universam ethicen Aristotelis (1585, a commentary on the Nicomachean Ethics; verses prefixed by Laurence Humphrey), which was the first book printed at the press presented to Oxford by their chancellor, Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, and which had been reprinted eight times in Frankfurt by 1625. Sphaera Civitatis (1588, a commentary on Aristotle's Politics), like other books by Case, was reprinted abroad, and Barnes, the printer, obtained an order from the university in 1590 that every bachelor should take one copy on \\"determining.\\" Case's later works were Reflexus Speculi Moralis (1596, a commentary on the Magna Moralia), Thesaurus Oeconomiae (1597, a commentary on the pseudo-Aristotelian Economics), Lapis philosophicus seu commentarius in VIII libros Physicorum Arisotelis in quo arcana physiologiae examinantur (1599, a commentary on Aristotle's Physics; despite the title it bears no relation to alchemy) and Ancilla Philosophiae (1599, an epitome of the Physics). He also wrote an Apologia Musices, tam vocalis quam instrumentalis et mixtae (1588), of which there is a copy in the Lambeth Library. The Praise of Musicke; wherein...is described the sober and lawful use of the same in the Congregation and Church of God (1586) is also attributed to him. This is dedicated to Sir Walter Raleigh by the printer Barnes, who calls it \\"an orphan of one of Lady Musicke's children.\\" A contemporary, Thomas Watson, wrote some verses, now in the Rawlinson manuscripts, to Case on the publication called \\"A Gratification unto Mr. John Case for his learned book lately made on the Praizes of Musick.\\" There are three letters from Case in the Harleian MS 6995.

Today, these lines are the SEPTA Regional Rail Paoli/Thorndale Line and Cynwyd Line, respectively. History The abandoned 52nd Street station in 1999 At 52nd Street, the Main Line is on an embankment at-grade, while the Schuylkill Branch is on an elevated structure including a Parker through truss spanning over the Main Line on an extreme skew. A lit sign informed inbound passengers which platform the next train to Center City, Philadelphia would depart from. Only a few trains in each direction stopped at this station, mostly serving reverse commuters heading out to jobs in the Main Line suburbs in the morning and returning home to the city in the evening. Through merger and bankruptcy, the station and the trains serving it passed from the PRR to the Penn Central to Conrail (the later under contract to SEPTA). The first westbound morning trip of Amtrak's Silverliner Service also stopped at the station. The station was burned by vandals on August 16, 1980. Conrail bused passengers until the 23rd, when SEPTA chose to outright close the station. The station came down in 1995 as part of revitalization efforts.

The actual activating ligands for and some functions of this receptor are disputed.  History  Initially discovered in 1998 as an Orphan receptor, i.e. a receptor whose activating ligand(s) and function were unknown, GPR17 was \\"deorphanized\\" in a study that reported it to be a receptor for LTC4, LTD4, and uracil nucleotides. In consequence, GPR17 attracted attention as a potential mediator of reactions caused by LTC4 and LTD4 viz., asthma, rhinitis, and urticarial triggered by allergens, nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs, and exercise (see Aspirin-induced asthma). Subsequent reports, however, have varied in results: studies focusing on the allergen and non-allergen reactions find that GPR17-bearing cells do not respond to LTC4, LTD4, and uracil nucleotides while studies focusing on nerve tissue find that certain types of GPR17-bearing oligodendrocytes do indeed respond to them. In 2013 and 2014 reports, the International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology took no position on which of these are true ligands for GPR17. GPR17 is a constitutively active receptor, i.e. a receptor that has baseline activity which is independent of, although potentially increased by, its ligands. Biochemistry GPR17 has a structure which is intermediate between the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor group (i.e. cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 and cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2) and the purine P2Y subfamily of 12 receptors (see P2Y receptors), sharing 28 to 48% amino acid identity with them. GPR17 is a G protein coupled receptor that acts primarily through G proteins linked to the Gi alpha subunit but also to Gq alpha subunit. Matching these structural relationships, GPR17 has been reported to be activated by cysteinyl leukotrienes (i.e. LTC4 and LTD4) as well as the purines (i.e., uridine, Uridine diphosphate (UDP), UDP-glucose). Further relating these receptors, GPR17 may dimerize (i.e. associate with) certain of the cited cysteinyl leukotriene or purine receptors in mediating cell responses and this dimerization may explain some of the discrepancies reported for the ability of these ligands to activate GPR17 as expressed in different cell types (see below section of Function). GPR17 is also activated by the emergency-signaling and atherosclerosis-promoting oxysterols and by synthetic compounds with broadly different structures. Relevant to its activating ligands as well as its reported interaction with other G protein coupled receptors, GPR17 is a promiscuous receptor. Montelukast which inhibits cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 and is in clinical use for the chronic and preventative treatment of LTC4- and LTD4-promoted allergic and non-allergic diseases, and Cangrelor, which inhibits P2Y purinergic receptors and is approved in the USA as an antiplatelet drug, inhibit the GPR17 receptor. Distribution GPR17 was first clone form and is highly expressed in certain precursors of oligodendrocytes in the nerve tissue of the central nervous system (CNS); it is overexpress in CNS tissues experiencing demyelination injuries; within 48 hours of the latter types of injuries, GPR17 expression is induced in dying neurons within and on the borders of injury, in infiltrating microglia and macrophages, and in activated oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Function Studies focusing on allergic and hypersensitivity reactions have found that the LTC4 and LTD4 ligands for Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLTR1) and Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2, which mediate these reactions, have disputed findings that LTC4 and LTD4 are ligands for GPR17. They have shown that cells co-expressing both CysLTR1 and GPR17 receptors exhibit a marked reduction in binding LTC4 and that mice lacking GPR17 are hyper-responsive to igE-induced passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. They therefore have nominated GPR17 as functioning to inhibit CysLTR1 in these model systems and as such might serve to dampen the acute reactions involving the cited LTs.W Studies focusing on nerve tissue indicate that GPR17 is: a) highly expressed in precursors to mature oligodendrocytes but not expressed in mature oligodendrocytes, suggesting that GPR17 must be down-regulated in order for precursor cells to proceed to terminal oligodendrocyte differentiation; b) activated by uridine, Uridine diphosphate (UDP) and UDP-glucose to stimulate outward K+ channels and the aforementioned maturation responses in oligodenrocyte precursor cells; c) also activated by LTC4 and LTD4; d) more highly expressed in central nervous system (CNS) tissues of animal models undergoing ischemia, Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and focal demyelination as well as in the CNS tissues of humans suffering brain damage due to ischemia, trauma, and multiple sclerosis; e) expressed in injured neurons and associated with the rapid death and clearance of these neurons in a model of mouse spinal cord crush injury; f) acts to reduce the extent of spinal cord injury in the latter model based on the increased extent of injury in GPR17-depleted mice; and g) acts to reduce inflammation, elevate hippocampus neurogenesis, and improve learning and memory in a rat model of age-related cognitive impairment based on the effects of the GPR17 antagonist, montelukast, as well as of GPR17 depletion. The studies suggest that GPR17 is a sensor of damage in the CNS and participates in the resolution of this damage by clearing and/or promoting the re-myelination of injured neurons caused by a variety of insults perhaps including old age. The GPR17 gene has also been found to regulate food intake response mediated by FOXO1. Clinical significance GPR17 has been proposed as a potential pharmacological target for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain injury in humans.

Along with the other previously \\"orphan\\" receptors GPR55 and GPR119, GPR18 has been found to be a receptor for endogenous lipid neurotransmitters, several of which also bind to cannabinoid receptors. Research supports the hypothesis that GPR18 is the abnormal cannabidiol receptor and N-arachidonoyl glycine, the endogenous lipid metabolite of anandamide, initiates directed microglial migration in the CNS through activation of GPR18, though recent evidence demonstrates that NAGly was not shown to be a GPR18 agonist in rat sympathetic neurons.

It is a neurotoxin that acts by interfering with oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria by inhibiting complex I, leading to the depletion of ATP and eventual cell death.PubChem Compound entry on MPP+ MPP+ arises in the body as the toxic metabolite of the closely related compound MPTP. MPTP is converted in the brain into MPP+ by the enzyme MAO-B, ultimately causing parkinsonism in primates by killing certain dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra. The ability for MPP+ to induce Parkinson's disease has made it an important compound in Parkinson's research since this property was discovered in 1983. The chloride salt of MPP+ found use in the 1970s as an herbicide under the trade name cyperquat. Though no longer in use as an herbicide, cyperquat's closely related structural analog paraquat still finds widespread usage, raising some safety concerns.  History  MPP+ has been known since at least the 1920s, with a synthesis of the compound being published in a German chemistry journal in 1923. Its neurotoxic effects, however, were not known until much later, with the first paper definitively identifying MPP+ as a Parkinson's-inducing poison being published in 1983. This paper followed a string of poisonings that took place in San Jose, California in 1982 in which users of an illicitly synthesized analog of meperidine were presenting to hospital emergency rooms with symptoms of Parkinson's. Since most of the patients were young and otherwise healthy and Parkinson's disease tends to afflict people at a much older age, researchers at the hospital began to scrutinize the illicitly synthesized opiates that the patients had ingested. The researchers discovered that the opiates were tainted with MPTP, which is the biological precursor to the neurotoxic MPP+. The MPTP was present in the illicitly synthesized meperidine analog as an impurity, which had a precedent in a 1976 case involving a chemistry graduate student synthesizing meperidine and injecting the resulting product into himself. The student came down with symptoms of Parkinson's disease, and his synthesized product was found to be heavily contaminated with MPTP. The discovery that MPP+ could reliably and irreversibly induce Parkinson's disease in mammals reignited interest in Parkinson's research, which had previously been dormant for decades. Following the revelation, MPP+ and MPTP sold out in virtually all chemical catalogs, reappearing months later with a 100-fold price increase.  Synthesis   Laboratory  MPP+ can be readily synthesized in the laboratory, with Zhang and colleagues publishing a representative synthesis in 2017. The synthesis involves reacting 4-phenylpyridine with methyl iodide in acetonitrile solvent at reflux for 24 hours. An inert atmosphere is used to ensure a quantitative yield. The product is formed as the iodide salt, and the reaction proceeds via an SN2 pathway. The industrial synthesis of MPP+ for sale as the herbicide cyperquat used methyl chloride as the source of the methyl group.400px  Biological  MPP+ is produced in vivo from the precursor MPTP. The process involves two successive oxidations of the molecule by monoamine oxidase B to form the final MPP+ product. This metabolic process occurs predominantly in astrocytes in the brain. Metabolism of MPTP to MPP+ in cerebral astrocytes.  Mechanism of toxicity  MPP+ exhibits its toxicity mainly by promoting the formation of reactive free radicals in the mitochondria of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. MPP+ can siphon electrons from the mitochondrial electron transport chain at complex I and be reduced, in the process forming radical reactive oxygen species which go on to cause further, generalized cellular damage. In addition, the overall inhibition of the electron transport chain eventually leads to stunted ATP production and eventual death of the dopaminergic neurons, which ultimately displays itself clinically as symptoms of Parkinson's disease. MPP+ also displays toxicity by inhibiting the synthesis of catecholamines, reducing levels of dopamine and cardiac norepinephrine, and inactivating tyrosine hydroxylase. The mechanism of uptake of MPP+ is important to its toxicity. MPP+ injected as an aqueous solution into the bloodstream causes no symptoms of Parkinsonism in test subjects, since the highly charged molecule is unable to diffuse through the blood-brain barrier. Furthermore, MPP+ shows little toxicity to cells other than dopaminergic neurons, suggesting that these neurons have a unique process by which they can uptake the molecule, since, being charged, MPP+ cannot readily diffuse across the lipid bilayer that composes cellular membranes. Unlike MPP+, its common biological precursor MPTP is a lipid-soluble molecule that diffuses readily across the blood-brain barrier. MPTP itself is not cytotoxic, however, and must be metabolized to MPP+ by MAO-B to show any signs of toxicity. The oxidation of MPTP to MPP+ is a process that can be catalyzed only by MAO-B, and cells that express other forms of MAO do not show any MPP+ production. Studies in which MAO-B was selectively inhibited showed that MPTP had no toxic effect, further cementing the crucial role of MAO-B in MPTP and MPP+ toxicity. Studies in rats and mice show that various compounds, including nobiletin, a flavonoid found in citrus, can rescue dopaminergic neurons from degeneration caused by treatment with MPP+. The specific mechanism of protection, however, remains unknown.  Uses   In scientific research  MPP+ and its precursor MPTP are widely used in animal models of Parkinson's disease to irreversibly induce the disease. Excellent selectivity and dose control can be achieved by injecting the compound directly into cell types of interest. Most modern studies use rats as a model system, and much research is directed at identifying compounds that can attenuate or reverse the effects of MPP+. Commonly studied compounds include various MAO inhibitors and general antioxidants. While some of these compounds are quite effective at stopping the neurotoxic effects of MPP+, further research is needed to establish their potential efficacy in treating clinical Parkinson's. The revelation that MPP+ causes the death of dopaminergic neurons and ultimately induces symptoms of Parkinson's disease was crucial in establishing the lack of dopamine as central to Parkinson's disease. Levodopa or L-DOPA came into common use as an anti-Parkinson's medication thanks to the results brought about by research using MPP+. Further medications are in trial to treat the progression of the disease itself as well as the motor and non-motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's, with MPP+ still being widely used in early trials to test efficacy.  As a pesticide  Paraquat, an herbicide structurally similar to cyperquat, is still widely used in agriculture. The molecule is depicted here as the chloride salt. MPP+, sold as the chloride salt under the brand name cyperquat, was used briefly in the 1970s as an herbicide to protect crops against nutsedge, a member of the cyperus genus of plants. MPP+ as a salt has much lower acute toxicity than its precursor MPTP due to the inability of the former to pass through the blood-brain barrier and ultimately access the only cells that will permit its uptake, the dopaminergic neurons. While cyperquat is no longer used as an herbicide, a closely related compound named paraquat is. Given the structural similarities, some have raised concerns about paraquat's active use as an herbicide for those handling it. However, studies have shown paraquat to be far less neurotoxic than MPP+, since paraquat does not bind to complex I in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, and thus its toxic effects can not be realized.  Safety  MPP+ is commonly sold as the water-soluble iodide salt and is a white-to-beige powder. Specific toxicological data on the compound is somewhat lacking, but one MSDS quotes an LD50 of 29 mg/kg via an intraperitoneal route and 22.3 mg/kg via a subcutaneous route of exposure. Both values come from a mouse model system. MPP+ encountered in the salt form is far less toxic by ingestion, inhalation, and skin exposure than its biological precursor MPTP due to the inability of MPP+ to cross the blood-brain barrier and freely diffuse across cellular membranes. There is no specific antidote to MPP+ poisoning. Clinicians are advised to treat exposure symptomatically.

The human gene is located on chromosome 6q27 and encodes a G-protein coupled receptor protein composed of 319 amino acids.  Function  The GPR31 receptor is most closely related in amino acid sequence to the oxoeicosanoid receptor 1, a G-protein coupled receptor encoded by the GPR170 gene. Oxoeicosanoid receptor 1 is the receptor for a family of arachidonic acid metabolites made by 5-lipoxygenase viz., 5-Hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE), 5-oxoicosanoic acid (5-oxo-ETE) and other members of this family of broadly bioactive cell stimuli. The GPR31 receptor is a receptor for very different arachidonic acid metabolite, 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), whose synthesis is catalyzed by 12-lipoxygenase; this conclusion is based on studies that cloned the receptor from the PC-3 prostate cancer cell line and found that the cloned receptor, when expressed in other cell types, bound with high affinity (Kd=5 nM) and mediated the actions of low concentrations of the S but not R stereoisomer of 12-HETE. In a [35S]GTPŒ≥S binding assay, which indirectly estimates a receptor's binding affinity with a ligand by measuring this ligand's ability to stimulate the receptor to bind [35S]GTPŒ≥S, 12(S)-HETE stimulated the cloned GPR31 receptor to bind [35S]GTPŒ≥S with an EC50 (effective concentration causing a 50% of maximal rise in [35S]GTPŒ≥S binding) was <0.3 nM; it was 42 nm for 15(S)-HETE, 390 nM for 5(S)-HETE, and undetectable for 12(R)-HETE. Importantly, however, we do not known if GPR31 interacts with structural analogs of 12(S)-HETE such as 12-oxo-ETE (a metabolite of 12(S)-HETE), various 5,12-diHETEs including LTB4, and an array of bioactive 12(S)-HETE and 12(R)-HETE metabolites, the Hepoxilins. Further studies will be needed to determine if the GPR31 receptor is dedicated to binding and mediating the action of 12(S)-HETE more or less exclusively or, like the oxoeicosanoid receptor 1, binds and mediates the actions of a family of analogs. GPR31 receptor, like the oxoeicosanoid receptor, activates the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway of intercellular signaling but unlike the oxoeicoanaoid receptor does not trigger rises in the concentration of cytosolic Ca2+; it also activates NFŒ∫B. GPR31 receptor therefore exhibits the stereospecificity and some other features generally expected from a true GPR receptor. 12(S)-HETE also: a) binds to and activates the leukotriene B4 receptor-2 (BLT2), a G protein-coupled receptor for the 5-lipoxygenase-derived arachidonic acid metabolite, LTB4 and LTB4 metabolites; b) binds to, but rather than activating, inhibits the G protein- coupled receptor for the cyclooxygenase-derived arachidonic acid metabolites prostaglandin H2 and thromboxane A2; c) binds with high affinity to a 50 kilodalton (Kda) subunit of a 650 kDa cytosolic and nuclear protein complex; and d) binds with low affinity to and activates intracellular Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma. These alternate binding and cell- activating sites complicate the determination of 12(S)-HETE's dependency on GPR31 in stimulating cells as well as the overall function of GPR31. The effects of GPR31 Gene knockout in animal models, a technique critical to defining the in vivo function of genes, will be critical to shedding light on these issues.  Tissue distribution  GPR31 receptor mRNA is highly expressed in the PC-3 prostate cancer cell line and to a lesser extent the DU145 prostate cancer cell line and to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC), and human pulmonary aortic endothelial cells (HPAC). Its mRNA is also express but at rather low levels in several other human cell lines including: K562 cells (human myelogenous leukemia cells); Jurkat cells (T lymphocyte cells); Hut78 cells (T cell lymphoma cells), HEK 293 cells (primary embryonic kidney cells), MCF-7 cells (mammary adenocarcinoma cellss), and EJ cells (bladder carcinoma cells). Mice express an ortholog to human GPR31 in their circulating blood platelets.  Clinical significance  The GPR31 receptor appears to mediate the responses of PC-3 prostate cancer cells to 12(S)-HETE in stimulating the MEK-ERK1/2 and NFŒ∫B pathways and therefore may contribute to the growth-promoting and metastasis-promoting actions that 12(S)-HETE is proposed to have in human prostate cancer. However, LNCaP and PC3 human prostate cancer cells also express BLT2 receptors; in LNCaP cells, BLT2 receptors stimulate the expression of the growth- and metastasis-promoting androgen receptor; in PC3 cells, BLT2 receptors stimulate the NF-Œ∫B pathway to inhibit the apoptosis induced by cell detachment from surfaces (i.e. Anoikis; and, in BLT2-overexpressing PWR-1E non-malignant prostate cells, 12(S)-HETE diminished anoikis-associated apoptotic cell death. Thus, the roles of 12(S)-HETE in human prostate cancer, if any, may involve its activation of either or both GPR31 and BLT2 receptors. The many other actions of 12(S)-HETE (see 12-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid) and any other ligands found to interact with this receptor will require studies similar those conducted on PC3 cells and mesenteric arteries to determine the extent to which they interact with BLT2, TXA2/PGH2, and PPARgamma receptors and thereby may contribute in part or whole to their activity. Clues implicating the GPR31, as opposed to the other receptors in the actions of 12(S)-HETE include findings that GPR31 receptors do not respond to 12(R)-HETE nor induce rises in cytosolic Ca2+ whereas the other receptors mediate one or both of these actions. These studies will be important because, in addition to prostate cancer, preliminary studies suggest that the GPR31 receptor is implicated in several other diseases such as malignant megakaryocytis (Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia), arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, progressive B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Diabetic neuropathy, and high grade astrocytoma.

Gene  The GPR32 was initially identified and defined by molecular cloning in 1998 as coding for an orphan receptor, i.e. a protein with an amino acid sequence similar to known receptors but having no known ligand(s) to which it responds and no known function. The projected amino acid sequence of GPR32, however, shared 35-39% amino acid identity with certain members of the chemotactic factor receptor family, i.e. 39% identity with Formyl peptide receptor 1, which is a receptor for N-Formylmethionine- leucyl-phenylalanine and related N-formyl peptide chemotactic factors, and 35% identity with Formyl peptide receptor 2, which likewise is also a receptor for N-formyl peptides but also a receptor for certain lipoxins which are arachidonic acid metabolites belonging to a set of specialized proresolving mediators that act to resolve or inhibit inflammatory reactions. GPR32 mapped to chromosomal 19, region q13.3. There are no mouse or other orthologs of GPR32.  Receptor  The GPR32 protein is a G protein coupled receptor although the specific G protein subtypes which it activates has not yet been reported. GPR32 is expressed in human blood neutrophils, certain types of blood lymphocytes (i.e. activated CD8+ cells, CD4+ T cells, and T helper 17 cells), tissue macrophages, small airway epithelial cells, and adipose tissue. When expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, GPR32 inhibits the Cyclic adenosine monophosphate signaling pathway under both baseline and forskolin- stimulated conditions indicating that it is a member of the class of orphan G protein coupled receptors that possesses constitutive signaling activity. At least 6 members of the D series of resolvins (RvDs) viz., RvD1, RvD2m AT-RVD1, RvD3, AT-RvD3, and RvD5, activate their target cells through this receptor; these results have led to naming GPR32 the RVD1 receptor (see resolvin mechanisms of action). RvDs are members of the specialized proresolving mediators (SPM) class of polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolites. RVDs are metabolites of the omega-3 fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and, along with other SRMs contribute to the inhibition and resolution of a diverse range of inflammation and inflammation-related responses as well as to the healing of these inflammatory lesions in animals and humans. The metabolism of DHA to RVD's and the activation of GPR32 by these RVD's are proposed to be one mechanism by which omega-3 fatty acids may ameliorate inflammation as well as various inflammation-based and other diseases.

It is strongly expressed in the cells of the pancreas and to a lesser extent in the brain. This membrane protein binds free fatty acids, acting as a nutrient sensor for regulating energy homeostasis. Activation/Inhibition The protein FFA1 is activated by medium to long chain fatty acids. FFA1 is most strongly activated by eicosatrienoic acid (20:3Œî11,14,17), but has been found to be activated by fatty acids as small as 10 carbons long. For saturated fatty acids the level of activation is dependent on the length of the carbon chain, which is not true for unsaturated fatty acids. It has been found that three hydrophilic residues (arginine-183, asparagine-244, and arginine-258) anchor the carboxylate group of a fatty acid, which activates FFA1.  In the pancreas  FFA1 is found in highest concentration in Islets of Langerhans, the endocrine portion of the pancreas. Activation of FFA1 results in an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ via the phosphoinositide pathway. When a free fatty acid docks on FFA1, the membrane protein becomes activated. This activation causes one of its subunits to dissociate from the receptor, which then activates phospholipase C (PLC) which is found in the cell membrane. PLC in turn hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2),which is also in the membrane, to diacyl glycerol (DAG) which stays in the membrane, and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3), which enters the cytosol. IP3 can then dock on a calcium channel in the endoplasmic reticulum which will facilitate the release of Ca2+ into the cytosol.Simple representation of how FFA1 is linked to increased cytosolic [Ca2+] The Ca2+ that is released then initiates a signal cascade, resulting in the secretion of insulin. A high concentration of glucose in the blood has been found to increase the transcription of the FFA1 gene, which has made these receptors a new target for the treatment of type II diabetes. While fatty acids themselves do not elicit insulin secretion, FFA1 activation increases the amount of insulin being secreted through various linked pathways. It has also been shown that chronic exposure to high amounts of free fatty acids, like on a high fat diet, can impair the function and secretory capacity of pancreatic Œ≤-cells. In the brain As stated previously, FFA1 has an affinity for long chain fatty acids. Such fatty acids are also present in the brain, where FFA1 has also been found in high abundance. FFA1 receptors are present over the entire brain, but in highest numbers in the medulla oblongata and the substantia nigra. Recent studies have also observed that FFA1 was present in the olfactory bulb, striatum, hippocampus, midbrain, hypothalamus, cerebellum, cerebral cortex and in the spinal cord. Fatty acids play an important role in normal brain development as well as maintaining proper neuronal function. It has been found that certain fatty acids that are in abundance in the brain may be linked with FFA1. These fatty acids likely activate FFA1, inducing an intracellular response. It has been found that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has a higher affinity than other fatty acids for FFA1. DHA makes up 30% and arachidonic acid, another fatty acid found in the brain, makes up 20% of the fatty acids in the brain. Both of these fatty acids must be obtained from the diet because the body cannot make them. A correct balance of these fatty acids is vital to normal brain function and structure. DHA is supplied to the brain via astrocytes, which release DHA so that it reaches a high enough concentration to act as an extracellular signal on FFA1. The abundance of FFA1 in the brain and the high affinity for DHA suggest that FFA1 may play a role in neuronal function in the brain. It is hypothesized that DHA and arachidonic acid could improve memory function by interacting with FFA1 in the hippocampus neurons. This hypothesis is based on the idea that once FFA1 is activated by these fatty acids, the resulting signal is related to progenitor cell proliferation. This implies that FFA1 signaling could stimulate the production of new memory cells in the brain. More research needs to be done in proving these suggestions, but if proven to be true FFA1 could be a target in producing new memory cells that are destroyed by diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Additionally, FFA1 abundance in the brain has been suggested to play a role in pain. DHA has been reported to induce an increased tolerance for pain without binding to opioid receptors. Researchers have hypothesized that stimulation of FFA1 by DHA could accelerate the release of endorphins, which is how DHA could induce an increased tolerance to pain. DHA binds to FFA1, which could activate a signaling cascade that leads to Ca2+ influx, which then leads to accelerated endorphin release and novel pain control. Again, additional research must be done to fully understand the mechanism and to prove these hypotheses, but the implications could provide additional targets for pain control in individuals. Oral Fat Detection FFA1(GPR40) has been implicated in the ability to taste fats. It is expressed in taste bud cells (specifically cell type I), and its absence leads to reduced preference to two types of fatty acid (linoleic acid and oleic acid), as well as decreased neuronal response to fatty acids administered orally. Mediator role in pathologic fibrotic pathways GPR40 was discovered to be a major mediator in pathologic fibrotic pathways in 2018.https://ajp.amjpathol.org/article/S0002-9440(17)30804-0/fulltext  Drugs under investigation  The molecule PBI-4050 which is an agonist of GPR40 is under investigation by the Canadian biotechnology firm Prometic. As of August 2018, it remains a promising drug targeting multiple type of fibrosis entering phase 3 clinical trials. FFA1 in Breast Cancer FFA1 has been found to be expressed in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. An increase in [Ca2+], which is a consequence of FFA1 activation, has been shown to modulate processes required for breast cancer cell proliferation. This suggests that FFA1 plays a crucial role in breast cancer proliferation. To further demonstrate this connection, pertussis toxin, which is a very specific inhibitor of GPCRs like FFA1, was found to diminish cancer cell proliferation. Also, using a PLC inhibitor diminished proliferation.

The human gene is denoted as HTR1E.  Function  The function of the 5-HT1E receptor is unknown due to the lack of selective pharmacological tools, specific antibodies, and permissive animal models. The 5-HT1E receptor gene lacks polymorphisms amongst humans (few mutations), indicating a high degree of evolutionary conservation of genetic sequence, which suggests that the 5-HT1E receptor has an important physiological role in humans. It is hypothesized that the 5-HT1E receptor is involved in the regulation of memory in humans due to the high abundance of receptors in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb, all of which are regions of the brain integral to memory regulation. This receptor is unique among the serotonin receptors in that it is not known to be expressed by rats or mouse species, all of which lack the gene encoding the 5-HT1E receptor. However the genomes of the pig, rhesus monkey, and several lagomorphs (including rabbit) as well as the guinea pig each encode a homologous 5-HT1E receptor gene. The guinea pig is the most likely candidate for future study of 5-HT1E receptor function in vivo. The expression of 5-HT1E receptors in the guinea pig brain has been pharmacologically confirmed; 5-HT1E receptor expression patterns of the human and guinea pig brains appear to be similar. In the human cortex, the expression of 5-HT1E undergoes a marked transition during adolescence, in a way that is strongly correlated with the expression of 5-HT1B. The most closely related receptor to the 5-HT1E is the 5-HT1F receptor. They share 57% amino acid sequence homology and have some pharmacological characteristics in common. Both receptors are Gi-coupled (inhibit adenylate cyclase activity) and both receptors have high affinities for 5-HT and low affinities for 5-carboxyamidotryptaine and mesulergine. However, due to major differences in brain expression patterns, these receptors are unlikely to mediate similar functions in humans. For example, 5-HT1E receptors are abundant in the hippocampus but are not detectable in the striatum (caudate and putamen of the human brain), while the opposite is true for the 5-HT1F receptor. Thus, conclusions about the function of the 5-HT1E receptor cannot be ascribed to the function of the 5-HT1F receptor, and vice versa.

The jurisdiction of the District Court includes most landlord‚Äìtenant cases, small claims (amounts up to $5,000), replevin actions, motor vehicle violations, misdemeanors, some felonies, and peace and protective orders. Eastside District Court District Courthouse on North Avenue The Eastside District Court Building, also known as North Avenue, is located at 1400 E. North Avenue in the North-Eastern area of Baltimore at the intersection of North Avenue and Harford Road. The property is owned by J4P ASSOCIATES.MD Department of Assessments and Taxation History The building was formerly a Sears store and was converted into a courthouse after the store closed in September 1981. The building, which stood at five stories height, was constructed in 1938 out of molded concrete on the site of the former Samuel Ready School. It was painted grey with black granite trim, with its windows and doors highlighted by molded bronze. The corner of the building at the intersection of North Avenue and Harford Road was flat and featured an enormous, three-story-high display window. It was claimed that this window was the largest of its kind in the world at the time at high, forty feet across and deep. The window would later be smashed in April 1968 during the riots that took place following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Other than the entrances, the only other source of natural light in the building came from several panels of glass brick that ran the full height of the third and fourth floors directly above the entrances. The store itself opened on September 21, 1938, with an opening ceremony that was attended by both the Governor of Maryland and the Mayor of Baltimore. It closed 43 years later due to what management called \\"efficiency of operation\\". In the building's current function as a courthouse the display window and Sears signs are gone, but the rest of the exterior has remained unaltered. Wabash District Court Edward F. Borgerding District Court Building The Edward F. Borgerding District Court Building, aka Wabash, is located at 5800 Wabash Avenue in the northwest section of Baltimore City. Construction started in 1985 and on February 5, 1986 it was officially dedicated with remarks from then Baltimore Mayor William Donald Schaefer, then Governor Harry Hughes and the chief judge of the Maryland Court of Appeals, Robert C. Murphy. The building uses its to house seven courtrooms, judges chambers, clerks' offices and satellite offices for the public defender and the state's attorney for Baltimore City. Graduations from the city's district drug courts are also held at this location. Patapsco District Court John R. Hargrove, Sr. District Court Building The newest of the Baltimore City District Courthouses is the John R. Hargrove, Sr. Building, located at 700 E. Patapsco Avenue in southern Baltimore City. The , two-story building was built on a parcel of land at Patapsco Avenue and 7th Street. In addition to five courtrooms, the building includes offices for the District One court operations, State's Attorney and Public Defender offices and parking for 262 cars. The general contractor for the $11.9 million facility was Roy Kirby and Sons, Inc., of Baltimore. The architect for the project was RCG/HOK, a joint venture (RCG of Baltimore and HOK of Washington, D.C.). History Ground for this new courthouse was broken in 2001 and it is named in honor of the late Judge John R. Hargrove, Sr., the first African-American to serve as an administrative judge of any court in Maryland. In 1974, Judge Hargrove was appointed to the Supreme Bench of Baltimore City, now the Circuit Court, where he served for ten years until his appointment by President Ronald Reagan to the federal bench in 1983. Judge Hargrove died April 1, 1997. Civil Division Baltimore's Civil District Court at Fayette and Gay Streets The Civil Division of the District Court of Maryland for Baltimore City is located at the intersection of Fayette and Gay Streets in Baltimore City. All minor civil matters including landlord tenant disputes, housing violations and minor civil suits are handled here. A parking garage, where portions of the movie ‚Ä¶and Justice for All were filmed, once stood next to the court building. The garage was torn down to make way for the Baltimore City Police headquarters. Central Booking The Baltimore City Central Booking Intake Center, also known as Central Booking, that is located at 300 E. Madison Street in the east-central part of Baltimore City also houses a courtroom for the District of Maryland for Baltimore City. The facility is largely a correctional intake facility run by the state of Maryland. Judges assigned here usually hold hearings involving persons recently arrested for crimes and who are being held, pre-trial, in lieu of a certain dollar amount bail. Bail review hearings are held daily with members of the Baltimore City State's Attorney's office and the Office of the Public Defender present.

Tissue distribution and function  The 5-HT2 receptors (of which the 5-HT2B receptor is a subtype) mediate many of the central and peripheral physiologic functions of serotonin. Cardiovascular effects include contraction of blood vessels and shape changes in platelets; central nervous system effects include neuronal sensitization to tactile stimuli and mediation of some of the effects of hallucinogenic substituted amphetamines. The 5-HT2B receptor is highly expressed in the liver and kidney, with lower levels of expression being seen in the cerebral cortex, whole brain, pancreas, and spleen. The 5-HT2B receptor subtype is involved in: * CNS: presynaptic inhibition, behavioural effects * Vascular: pulmonary vasoconstriction * Cardiac: The 5-HT2B receptor regulates cardiac structure and functions as demonstrated by the abnormal cardiac development observed in 5-HT2B receptor null mice. The 5-HT2B receptor stimulation can also lead to pathological proliferation of cardiac valve fibroblasts, which with chronic overstimulation of 5-HT2B can lead to a severe valvulopathy. Moreover, 5-HT2B receptors were recently shown to be overexpressed in human failing heart and antagonists of 5-HT2B receptors were uncovered to prevent both angiotensin II or beta-adrenergic agonist-induced pathological cardiac hypertrophy in mouse. * Serotonin transporter: 5-HT2B receptors regulate serotonin release via the serotonin transporter, and are important both to normal physiological regulation of serotonin levels in blood plasma, and with the abnormal acute serotonin release produced by drugs such as MDMA. Surprisingly however 5-HT2B receptor activation appears to be protective against the development of serotonin syndrome following elevated extracellular serotonin levels, despite its role in modulating serotonin release.  Clinical significance  5-HT2B receptors have also been strongly implicated in drug-induced valvular heart disease. In this context, it is generally considered to be an antitarget. The structure of the 5-HT2B receptor was resolved in a complex with the valvulopathogenic drug ergotamine.; Ligands As of 2009, few highly selective 5-HT2B receptor ligands have been discovered, although numerous potent non-selective compounds are known, particularly agents with concomitant 5-HT2C binding.

His feuds with Yasu Fuji & Chati Yokochi, Black Angus Campbell and manager Percival A. Friend and Eduardo Miguel Perez were the cause of frequent riots and arrests in the St. Joseph-Kansas City area during the summer of 1972. He also had a successful stint in Stu Hart's Stampede Wrestling, holding the promotions Stampede Wrestling North American Heavyweight Championship for much of early 1974. Career Early career Born in Jonesboro, Georgia, he made his professional wrestling debut in 1956 at age 30.

He would also briefly feud with The Golden Terror before leaving the area in early August. NWA Central States and the Gulf Coast The following year, he would defeat Jack Dalton for the Louisiana Heavyweight Championship in Baton Rouge, Louisiana on February 3 and, with Bobby Fields, defeated Jack and Frank Dalton for the NWA United States Tag Team Championship on February 21, 1967. Losing the Louisiana Heavyweight title to Ken Lucas on March 31 and the tag team titles back to the Daltons on April 11, he and Luke Brown would defeat Dick Murdoch and K.O. Kox in Kansas City, Missouri three months later to win the NWA North American Tag Team Championship on June 30. The two would defend the titles for a little more than a month before Brown walked out on Danny Little Bear during a match on September 4. He later regained the tag team titles teaming with Stan Pulaski to defeat Tarzan Tyler and The Viking in a tournament final for the tag team titles on September 18. Although losing the titles to Luke Brown and The Ox the following month, Danny Little Bear teamed with The Viking to recapture the tag team titles from his former tag team partner in St. Joseph, Missouri on November 7. Holding the titles for less than two weeks, they would lose the titles to K.O. and Killer Karl Kox on November 20, 1967. Two years later, Danny Little Bear won the NWA Central States Heavyweight championship in a tournament in St. Joseph on November 28, 1969. He held the title for over four months before losing the title to Roger Kirby on April 3, 1970. While in Maple Leaf Wrestling, he and Reg Parks lost to The Hollywood Blonds (Buddy Roberts and Jerry Brown) at the Varsity Arena in Toronto, Ontario on September 5, 1971.

Later that month, he and Pat O'Connor would fight to a 45-minute time limit draw against Fuji and Yokochi in a 2-of-3 falls match at the Kansas City Memorial Hall in Kansas City on March 23. Feud with Black Angus Campbell On March 29 at the St. Joseph City Auditorium, he would reunite with The Viking in the semi-main event to challenge Fuji and Yokochi for the tag team titles; however, the two began fighting with each other as the match started and were counted out. Later that night, he and The Viking would also be included in a 12¬Ω-man battle royal which included Bob Orton, Sr., Steve Bolus, Pat O'Connor, Terry Martin, Rufus R. Jones, \\"Black\\" Jack Black, Yasu Fuji and Chati Yokochi, Omar Atlas, Black Angus Campbell and Percival Friend. While attempting to throw Percival Friend over the top rope, Danny Little Bear would be eliminated by Earl Black. The winner was to receive a $1,250 purse as well as a title shot against then NWA World Heavyweight Champion Dory Funk, Jr. He and The Stomper would soon begin pursuing the NWA North American Tag Team Champions losing to them in a Texas Death Match on May 12. As the end of the match, as Danny Little Bear was about to pass out from a nervehold submission hold applied by Yasu Fuji, local and state police had to restrain several fans from entering the ring. They would also fight them to a no-contest in a Texas Tornado match which eventually involved much of the wrestlers backstage to break up the fight. Despite these setbacks, he and The Stomper were able to win the titles later that month. During this time, he began feuding with Black Angus Campbell over the NWA Central States Heavyweight Championship and soon lost the title to Campbell in Kansas City. Following the match, Campbell and his manager Percival A. Friend had to leave the arena under a police escort as fights started breaking out in the crowd. A later rematch against Campbell in St. Joseph, Missouri resulted in a small riot that occurred when two fans attacked Campbell's manager Percival A. Friend breaking his nose and attempting to enter the ring on behalf of Danny Little Bear. However, police having been assigned to the auditorium, the fans were stopped before they could get to Campbell although promoter Gust Karras chose not to pursue charges against them. He and Omar Atlas would also lose the tag team titles to Campbell and Roger Kirby on June 29. On June 13, he and Rufus Jones defeated Angus Campbell, Roger Kirby and manager Percival Friend in a handicap match Des Moines, Iowa. Later that year, he also defeated Harley Race as well as continuing to feud with Campbell and Kirby over the NWA Central States North American Tag Team titles facing them in a 2-of-3 falls match at the NWA Central States 40th Anniversary Show on September 22. Although Danny Little Bear took the first fall pinning Roger Kirby, he was pinned by Campbell while Kirby scored the third pinfall pinning Omar Atlas thanks in part to outside interference by Percival Friend. During the next few weeks, he defeated Harley Race on September 29 and Juan Sebastian on October 19. On November 3, Danny Little Bear teamed with Omar Atlas and Les Thornton in a 6-man tag team match against Billy Howard, Juan Sebastian and The Destroyer in a 2-3 falls match in the semi-final main event at the St. Joseph City Auditorium in St. Joseph, Missouri. The match would last almost an hour with each team gaining one fall before Howard, Sebastian and The Destroyer scored the final pinfall after Omar Atlas was pinned. Near the end of the match, several fans began storming the ring while Danny Little Bear faced The Destroyer. Police were able to prevent fans from entering the ring however and eventually arrested six fans before the crowd calmed down. Later that year, he teamed with rival Black Angus Campbell to defeat Roger Kirby and The Destroyer although they failed to defeat NWA North American Central States Tag Team Champions Harley Race and Roger Kirby on December 5, 1972. During the next year, he would regain the NWA Central States Heavyweight Championship from Roger Kirby on April 27 before losing the title to \\"Bulldog\\" Bob Brown two months later. He would also make a failed bid against recently crowned NWA World Heavyweight Champion Harley Race losing to him in St. Joseph on May 25, 1973, as well as several rematches in Des Moines the following month. Stampede Wrestling In early 1974, he began wrestling for Calgary-based Stampede Wrestling defeating The Stomper for the Stampede North American Heavyweight title on April 12. Enjoying a five-month reign as Stampede North American Heavyweight Champion, he also faced Jack Brisco in a match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in Calgary, Alberta on June 5 before losing the title to John Quinn on September 13, 1974. Returning to the Kansas City- area, he would score victories over Jesse Ventura, Buddy King and Charlie Pullins before fighting to a no contest with Tank Patton in Sedalia, Missouri on July 22, 1975.

Theatre Ventures, Inc. (which premiered in Beijing, China, at the historic \\"Great Hall of the People\\" in 2005) and his Los Angeles Dance Theater. www.losangelesdancetheater.com He is currently (2019) developing more large scale dance-musicals and staging his and Balanchine's ballets for the world's major companies, and editing his autobiography ‚ÄúThe Sorcerer‚Äôs Apprentice, From Hollywood to Balanchine and Back.‚Äù Clifford was a principal dancer and choreographer with George Balanchine‚Äôs New York City Ballet (1966‚Äì74), and guest artist from 1974‚Äì80, and was widely considered to be Balanchine‚Äôs prot√©g√© (Saturday Review). He choreographed his first (of eight) ballets for the NYC Ballet under Balanchine at age 20, thus making him the second-youngest choreographer in history ever to be attached to a major company. The first was Balanchine himself, who was 20 yrs-old when he choreographed his first ballet for Serge Diaghilev's \\"Ballets Russes.\\" During his time with Balanchine, in his early 20s, he also was a guest choreographer with companies ranging from the San Francisco Ballet, to the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, to the Deutsche Oper Ballet in Berlin. Clifford's works were also featured in many TV shows and movies, such as \\"Flashdance,\\" \\"The Man Who Loved Women,\\" and TV series such as \\"Dynasty,\\" \\"Glitter,\\" and other shows produced by Blake Edwards and Aaron Spelling. Trained in Los Angeles by the teachers Carmelita Maracci, Katherine Etienne, George Zoritch, Natalia Claire, David Lichine, Eugene Loring, Maria Bekefi, Irina Kosmovska, and Eleanor Powell's Tap teacher, Willie Covan, his first ballet appearance was at the age of 11 as the ‚ÄúNutcracker Prince‚Äù in Balanchine's New York City Ballet production of ‚ÄúThe Nutcracker‚Äù at the Los Angeles Greek Theater. Other early performances were as a regularly featured dancer on the Danny Kaye and Dinah Shore television shows. He also was a child actor often seen on the Donna Reed Show and Death Valley Days (hosted by Ronald Reagan). His first major choreography, at age 16, was for a production of West Side Story (conducted by Leonard Slatkin) for the Los Angeles Youth Theater. His other Los Angeles choreography was for an early attempt at the establishment of a resident ballet for Los Angeles, the ‚ÄúWestern Ballet Association.‚Äù Clifford was a principal dancer and choreographer for this company, which was founded in 1965 by Balanchine under the name of ‚ÄúBallet of Los Angeles.‚Äù The name was changed when Eugene Loring followed Balanchine as director of this short-lived company, but this is where Balanchine first became aware of Clifford's choreography (he created two original ballets in the summer of 1966). After seeing rehearsals of these ballets Balanchine invited Clifford to New York to begin choreographing for his School of American Ballet. In October of the same year, at the age of 19, he was invited to join the New York City Ballet (NYCB). He choreographed his first of eight ballets for that company at the age of 20. At NYCB Clifford quickly rose to principal dancer status and had numerous principal roles created for him by Balanchine, Jerome Robbins, John Taras, Todd Bolender, and Jacques d‚ÄôAmboise, and danced the leading roles in over 45 ballets. Before he founded the Los Angeles Ballet, Clifford was the first American male guest artist in history to dance with the Paris Opera Ballet. He was also a popular guest star on numerous European galas, dancing on the same programs as the legendary Russian dancers Yuri Soloviev and Irina Kolpakova to name but two great artists. During these early years, he was also commissioned to choreograph new ballets by the San Francisco Ballet, the Royal Winnipeg Ballet and the Deutsche Oper Ballet (Berlin), and was also invited by this same company, at the age of 25, to become their artistic director. He felt he was too young at that time, and did not want to leave Balanchine's tutelage, or the New York City Ballet, so he declined their offer. Established in 1974 under his direction, the Los Angeles Ballet went on to perform five critically successful U.S. National tours, including New York City (twice at Lincoln Center with the New York Philharmonic, and at the Joyce Theater and the Brooklyn Academy of Music); dance in the Far East, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and Canada, and appear in numerous films and television programs. The Los Angeles Ballet disbanded after facing financial troubles; upwards of $400,000 in unpaid loans and grievances filed by 45 dancers for 40 weeks of unpaid wages, resulting in a settlement of over $1,000,000. This company also appeared twice at the Hollywood Bowl with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and at the Greek Theater, the Los Angeles Music Center, Ambassador Auditorium, the Shrine Auditorium, the Pantages Theater, and virtually every theater and University of note in Southern California. They also renovated the John Anson Ford Theater thus transforming it into a major dance venue. The company performed approximately 100 times annually in the Los Angeles area, as well as offering free performances to over 150,000 local school children. This company also supported the largest ballet school in Southern California, the Los Angeles Dance Center, which supplied numerous dancers to not only the Los Angeles Ballet, but also to the NYC Ballet, San Francisco Ballet, Zurich Ballet, and American Ballet Theater. Students of his and his school include the well-known stars of the NYC Ballet of the 1980s and '90s Damian Woetzel and Darci Kistler, and students from his school have become leading dancers with the major companies in Germany, Switzerland, France, London, and Holland; as well as across the United States. As a freelance choreographer Clifford has created ballets for Les Ballets de Monte Carlo, (4) Teatro Col√≥n, Buenos Aires, (4) Deutsche Oper Ballet, Berlin, (2) Zurich Ballet, (2) Maggio Danza, Florence, Italy, and has staged his works for the Ballet du Nord, France, (4) the Rome Opera Ballet, (2) and Ballet British Columbia. In America, in addition to his eight works for the New York City Ballet, his ballets have been commissioned by the San Francisco Ballet, Miami City Ballet, Pacific Northwest Ballet (Seattle), Dallas Ballet, Santa Fe Festival Ballet, North Carolina Dance Theater, Atlanta Ballet, Chicago Ballet, Oakland Ballet, and the Sacramento Ballet. Clifford is also a Ballet Master/Repetiteur for the George Balanchine Trust.

Agonists and antagonists for 5-HT receptors, as well as serotonin uptake inhibitors, present promnesic (memory- promoting) and/or anti-amnesic effects under different conditions, and 5-HT receptors are also associated with neural changes.  Function  The gene described in this record is a member of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor family and encodes a multi-pass membrane protein that functions as a receptor for 5-hydroxytryptamine and couples to G proteins, negatively influencing cAMP levels via Gi and Go. This protein has been shown to function in part through the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. The 5-HT5A receptor has been shown to be functional in a native expression system. Rodents have been shown to possess two functional 5-HT5 receptor subtypes, 5-HT5A and 5-HT5B, however while humans possess a gene coding for the 5-HT5B subtype, its coding sequence is interrupted by stop codons, making the gene non-functional, and so only the 5-HT5A subtype is expressed in human brain. It also appears to serve as a presynaptic serotonin autoreceptor.  Clinical significance  The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has been implicated in a wide range of psychiatric conditions and also has vasoconstrictive and vasodilatory effects.  Selective Ligands  Few highly selective ligands are commercially available for the 5-HT5A receptor. When selective activation of this receptor is desired in scientific research, the non-selective serotonin receptor agonist 5-Carboxamidotryptamine can be used in conjunction with selective antagonists for its other targets (principally 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, and 5-HT7). Research in this area is ongoing.

Less than 66% of Pennsylvania high school graduates, who enroll in a four-year college in Pennsylvania, will earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years.National Center for Education Statistics Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English. Graduation requirements The Brentwood Borough School Board requires a minimum of 25 credits for a student to graduate including: English 4 credits, Graduation project 1 credit, Social Students 4 credits, Science 3 credits, Mathematics 4 credits, Arts/Humanities 2 credits, Health and PE. 1 and Electives 6 credits.Brentwood Borough School Board Graduation Requirements Policy 217 Additionally, the board requires that the student achieve a score at the advanced or proficient levels on the writing, reading and mathematics assessments of the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment (PSSA) administered in the eleventh grade. By law, all Pennsylvania secondary school students must complete a project as a part of their eligibility to graduate from high school. The type of project, its rigor and its expectations are set by the individual school district. At Brentwood Borough a students may focus on: research on a Curriculum-related project; a School/Community improvement project; an Entrepreneurial project; an Internship or apprenticeship with a local business or corporation or a personal interest project. By Pennsylvania School Board regulations, for the graduating classes 2016, students must demonstrate successful completion of secondary level course work in Algebra I, Biology, English Composition, and Literature for which the Keystone Exams serve as the final course exams. Students‚Äô Keystone Exam scores shall count for at least one-third of the final course grade. Dual enrollment The high school offers a Dual Enrollment program. This state program permits high school students to take courses, at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits. Students remain enrolled at their high school. The courses count towards high school graduation requirements and towards earning a college degree. The students continue to have full access to activities and programs at their high school, including the graduation ceremony. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. The state offers a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books. Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions. The Pennsylvania College Credit Transfer System reported in 2009, that students saved nearly $35.4 million by having their transferred credits count towards a degree under the new system. For the 2009-10 funding year, the school district received a state grant of $1,940 for the program.Pennsylvania Department of Education Dual Enrollment Fall Grants 2009-10. August 2009 Disciplinary code and demerit system The high school has a highly developed system from unexcused tardiness and public displays of affection to terroristic threats/acts and violation of the Pennsylvania Crime Code. The system is progressive and can ultimately end in expulsion from school. Extracurriculars The district offers a wide variety of clubs, band, musical, other activities and sports. The school board determines eligibility policies to participate in these programs. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs including all athletics. The students must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools.

Fisher, retired Chief, US Border Patrol, - Class of 1982 Controversy On February 3, 2012 during a break in a high school basketball game between Brentwood and Monessen High School, two students in the Brentwood seating section dressed in banana costumes proceeded to run around the basketball court in an effort to energize the crowd. The students were then immediately ejected for going onto the court, despite the claim that it was done to elicit \\"team spirit\\" from the crowd. Parents from Monessen objected strenuously to the event stating that the banana costumes were intended as a racial slur against Monessen, where many of the students are black (of African descent). It was also alleged that the two students in costume were hurling racial insults at the Monessen players. Subsequently, the Superintendent of Monessen demanded that the two Brentwood students be reprimanded and the school officially apologize for the incident. After an investigation it could not be definitively proven that racial slurs were used. The WPIAL, the governing body for western Pennsylvania sports, stepped in to investigate further. The WPIAL board found no direct evidence of racism in the actions of the Brentwood students but advised that steps be taken to prevent future volatile events from occurring.

It is a G protein- coupled receptor (GPCR) that is coupled to Gs and mediates excitatory neurotransmission. HTR6 denotes the human gene encoding for the receptor. Distribution The 5HT6 receptor is expressed almost exclusively in the brain. It is distributed in various areas including, but not limited to, the olfactory tubercle, cerebral cortex (frontal and entorhinal regions), nucleus accumbens, striatum, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, and the molecular layer of the cerebellum. Based on its abundance in extrapyramidal, limbic, and cortical regions it can be suggested that the 5HT6 receptor plays a role in functions like motor control, emotionality, cognition, and memory.  Function  Blockade of central 5HT6 receptors has been shown to increase glutamatergic and cholinergic neurotransmission in various brain areas, whereas activation enhances GABAergic signaling in a widespread manner. Antagonism of 5HT6 receptors also facilitates dopamine and norepinephrine release in the frontal cortex, while stimulation has the opposite effect. As a drug target for antagonists Despite the 5HT6 receptor having a functionally excitatory action, it is largely co-localized with GABAergic neurons and therefore produces an overall inhibition of brain activity. In parallel with this, 5HT6 antagonists are hypothesized to improve cognition, learning, and memory. Agents such as latrepirdine, idalopirdine (Lu AE58054), and intepirdine (SB-742,457/RVT-101) were evaluated as novel treatments for Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. However, phase III trials of latrepirdine, idalopirdine, and intepirdine have failed to demonstrate efficacy. 5HT6 antagonists have also been shown to reduce appetite and produce weight loss, and as a result, PRX-07034, BVT-5,182, and BVT-74,316 are being investigated for the treatment of obesity. As a drug target for agonists Recently, the 5HT6 agonists WAY-181,187 and WAY-208,466 have been demonstrated to be active in rodent models of depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and such agents may be useful treatments for these conditions. Additionally, indirect 5HT6 activation may play a role in the therapeutic benefits of serotonergic antidepressants like the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs).

Kiva is the series' ninth season in its Heisei era, and 18th season overall since the debut of Kamen Rider in 1971. It premiered on January 27, 2008, following the finale of Kamen Rider Den-O. It aired as a part of TV Asahi's 2008 Super Hero Time block with Engine Sentai Go-onger. The series was advertised as having a horror film theme, with the primary motif for Kamen Rider Kiva as a vampire. The first episode began with a commemoration of the series in honor of the seventieth anniversary of Shotaro Ishinomori's birthday. Synopsis Twenty-two years after the disappearance of his father, Wataru Kurenai lives in an infamous \\"haunted house\\" where he is destined as Kamen Rider Kiva to fight life- draining monsters called Fangires, the very race his father fought years ago before his disappearance. Wataru must also deal with Kamen Rider Ixa who is part of an organization seeking to destroy the Fangire menace, as well as the Fangires' own Rider, Kamen Rider Saga. The story is split between the actions of Wataru in the present (2008‚Äì09) and his father Otoya in the past (1986‚Äì87), slowly revealing the link between the Fangire race and Kiva. The characters of Kamen Rider Kiva are spread throughout two time periods, each related to one another. There are the actions of Otoya Kurenai and the Fangire Hunter Yuri Aso with the Wolfen Jiro in the year 1986 with the first Ixa Ver.I that result in the various Fangires that persist to the current day, in 2008, with Otoya's son Wataru (as Kamen Rider Kiva) alongside Keisuke Nago (as Kamen Rider Ixa Ver.X) and Yuri's daughter Megumi (also a Fangire Hunter), dealing with the Fangires to prevent deaths. Episodes Each episode's title is a word or phrase relating to music and a phrase describing the episode separated by a symbol from musical notation. For example, the second episode's title is written in Japanese as \\"\\", using the eighth note. An exception is the finale, which uses the music end barline at the end of the title. From episode 2 onward, Kivat begins the majority of episodes by stating a piece of trivia about music, art, chess, and other subjects. From episode 30 onward, Tatsulot joins the opening statement as he and Kivat provide recaps of the previous episode. Films Climax Deka A movie titled opened in theaters on April 12, 2008. It features a meeting between the characters of Kiva and the characters of Kamen Rider Den-O. They team up to fight a new evil Imagin who has teamed up with the Fangire Clan. Alongside Climax Deka, a short film titled was shown as a double feature. King of the Castle in the Demon World opened in Japanese theaters on August 9, 2008. It featured two new Riders who have been shown in silhouettes in Japanese children's magazines, , who is a monster hunter named portrayed by Shouma Yamamoto, partnered with and the villain of the movie , a death-row inmate who transforms into with , portrayed by Ken Horiuchi of the comedy troupe Neptune. The movie takes place in an alternate universe, as trying to place the story of the movie anywhere within the story of the series always leaves events out of place and would cancel out other events. Furthermore, Shouma Yamamoto portrays Takato Shiramine in the Kamen Rider Kiva movie, but he also portrays Taiga Nobori in the actual series. \\"Den-Liner, Into Space!\\" is a planetarium show using the cast of Kiva and Den-O to teach children about the universe. It was being shown at the Kagoshima Municipal Science Hall's planetarium between January 2 and March 30, 2009. Adventure Battle DVD In the Hyper Battle DVD , Wataru Kurenai, Keisuke Nago, and Otoya Kurenai introduce themselves to a boy (the viewer) who has wandered into the Caf√© mald'amour and offer to teach him how he can be like each of them. This DVD is referred to as an and it takes on the form of a Choose Your Own Adventure story. After having an \\"Ixa-cise\\" with Nago and a special lesson from Otoya, a Fangire attacks and the viewer can choose to transform Kiva into Garulu Form, Basshaa Form, Dogga Form, or the secret DoGaBaKi Emperor Form. King of Vampire For Kivas S.I.C. Hero Saga side story , the story follows the life of the characters following the finale while expanding on other instances in the history of the 1986 storyline. The story had begun running in the January 2010 issue of Monthly Hobby Japan magazine. Like the series' episode titles, the titles of the first three chapters of the S.I.C. Hero Saga follow a similar format, but feature two musically themed titles separated by an item from musical notation (the former is an opera while the latter is a song from said opera, the third names the composer and one of his songs). The first chapter uses the Segno. The last chapter is a retelling of the final scene of the TV series, except instead of Masao and the Neo-Fangires, Kiva-la comes to warn them about the Lion Fangire having turned into a giant Sabbat. ;Chapter titles # # # # Novel , written by Kenji Konuta and supervised by Toshiki Inoue, is part of a series of spin- off novel adaptions of the Heisei Era Kamen Riders.

This gene maps to the same region as the locus for benign neonatal epilepsy. Mice deficient for this gene have increased fat mass despite decreased food intake suggesting a role for this gene product in the regulation of energy homeostasis. Research Studies performed by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), found that two specific polymorphisms in the MC3R gene may be associated with pediatric obesity and greater body mass because of greater energy intake. Children who were homozygous for C17A + G241A consumed approximately 38% more than those who did not contain aforementioned polymorphisms.

They were built by English Electric and the New Zealand Railways Department (NZR) between 1938 and 1940, and hauled mainly passenger trains on the Wellington region's 1500 V DC electrification, and banked freight trains on the steep section between Paekakariki and Pukerua Bay. The locomotives featured a unique wheel arrangement, 1-Do-2 under the UIC classification system, and incorporated a quill drive to the driving wheels. They were found to be hard on the tracks, leading to speed restrictions on these locomotives and their replacement by EW class locomotives on the Johnsonville Line after the introduction of the EW in 1952. The EW was considered more suited to passenger services than the ED and replaced them on most passenger services on other lines.  Classification  Like all other electric locomotives in New Zealand, the leading letter of the locomotive's classification is E. There are two predominant theories about how the ED class acquired the second letter, D. The first is that it comes from the \\"Do\\" of its 1-Do-2 wheel arrangement. The second is from its original allocation to two locations, Wellington and Otira - Arthur's Pass, hence \\"duplicated\\". Official records provide no confirmation of either theory. Introduction New Zealand Railways purchased one ED class locomotive in 1938 from English Electric, No. 101, for use on the newly opened Tawa Flat deviation, which incorporated two long tunnels. This locomotive was known as \\"The Sergeant\\" because of the three longitudinal stripes on each side of the body that were unique to this locomotive. The tender required the supply of locomotive components for the other locomotives required, as it was thought desirable to carry out manufacture in New Zealand in NZR workshops. A further seven locomotives were assembled at the Hutt Workshops, and two at Addington Workshops for use on the Otira - Arthur's Pass section of the Midland Line. The two South Island locomotives were later transferred north.  Renumbering  With the introduction of the Traffic Monitoring System (TMS) in 1979, the two remaining locomotives were renumbered ED15 and ED21. Steam boilers Each locomotive (Ed 101 to Ed 108; not Ed 109 & ED 110) originally had oil-fired water-tube boilers for passenger carriage steam heaters, supplied by the Sentinel Waggon Works. The boiler could supply of steam per hour at a pressure of , and the water and oil tanks had capacities of respectively, so could steam for four hours before refilling. Hoy, D.G. Rails out of the Capital p. 64 (NZRLS, 1970) However they were shut down or removed in 1950 due to \\"on-going reliability problems\\"; air turbulence particularly in tunnels or when trains passed on double track resulted in downdraughts affecting the boiler and in passenger discomfort in winter. In June 1951 the DME said that the cost of fitting suitable boilers for the section from Paekakariki to Wellington was not warranted as the carriages leaving Paekakariki had residual heat, and a steam loco could pre-heat carriages before they left Wellington. In 1954-55 two boilers were installed in the Wellington station basement (and in 1958 one went to the NZR Road Services garage in Rotorua). The CME then wanted eight locos to have boilers for the 1955 winter, but parts were not available for the obsolete boilers and \\"refurbishing did not proceed\\". It was also found that the boilers were unreliable as the burners had been amended to be outside the normal operating specifications.

The remaining two were kept in sporadic service until March 1981, when both locomotives were sold into preservation. There were plans to send them back to the Otira - Arthurs Pass section but nothing came of this.

The ballet premiered on January 7, 1964, at the New York City Center, performed by New York City Ballet's Patricia McBride and Edward Villella. Production George Balanchine originally created Tarantella, a pas de deux, to showcase New York City Ballet dancers Patricia McBride and Edward Villella's techniques, especially the latter's speed and jumps. According to Villella, Balanchine created Tarantella between rehearsals of his other works, and each time they would only work on small sections and not in order. Villella only realized the stamina required when Balanchine put all the choreography together. He later recalled, \\"I would be flying parallel to the floor, and then I would be in the wings, on the ground, gasping for air\\". New York Times critic Anna Kisselgoff wrote that Danish choreographer August Bournonville's influence on Balanchine is \\"debatable\\", but Tarantella is one of Balanchine's ballets that \\"paid homage\\" to Bournonville. The title of the ballet is taken from Tarantella, a type of Neapolitan folk dance accompanied by tambourines. Hershy Kay rearranged Louis Moreau Gottschalk's Grande Tarantelle for the ballet. The costumes are designed by Barbara Karinska. The man dresses in red and black and wears a gold earring while the woman is in red and white. The dancers also uses tambourines. The ballet was NYCB's last premiere at the New York City Center before moving to New York State Theater. Revivals Other companies that have performed Tarantella include the Miami City Ballet, which Villella founded, Pacific Northwest Ballet, Joffrey Ballet, San Francisco Ballet, and The Royal Ballet. In 2018, at New York City Ballet's festival \\"Balanchine: The City Center Years\\", Tarantella was performed by Anna Rose O'Sullivan and Marcelino Samb√©, both from The Royal Ballet.

It is located on the chromosome 18 in the human genome. When the melanocortin 5 receptor was disrupted in transgenic mice, it induced disruption of their exocrine glands and resulted in decreased production of sebum. Physiology MC5R is necessary for normal sebum production. Stimulation of MC5R promotes fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle and lypolysis in adipocytes. MC5R is essential for erythrocyte differentiation. MC5R is involved in inflammation. MC5R helps maintain thermal homeostasis. MC5R is expressed in the brain at different levels depending on physical activity.  Pheromones  MC5R is heavily expressed in the preputial gland in mice (a modified sebaceous gland involved in pheromone production). MC5R deficiency in male mice decreases aggressive behavior, promotes defensive behavior and encourages other male mice to attack MC5R-deficient males through pheremonal signals.

Father was Wiley Middleton and mother was Julia Lockling Middleton. Life Middleton studied with Charles R. Adams and Alexander Emslie and made his debut at the New York Metropolitan Opera in 1914. Other musical associations included the Apollo Club in Chicago and the New York Symphony Orchestra.Edison:Instrumental Selections on the Edison Diamond Discs (1912-1929) at memory.loc.gov Middleton sang secondary roles at the Metropolitan Opera during a tenure encompassing only 22 performances between November 1914 and February 1916. In both his debut on November 18, 1914 and his farewell on February 26, 1916, he appeared as the Herald in Wagner's Lohengrin. He sang two other Wagnerian roles for the company: Titurel in Parsifal and Donner in Das Rheingold. His non-Wagnerian roles were Ludwig in Weber's Euryanthe and Don Fernando in Beethoven's Fidelio.BiblioTech PRO V3.2b at 66.187.153.86 Middleton also appeared at least once with the company on tour in Philadelphia, where he again appeared as the Lohengrin Herald on December 8, 1914. Middleton's repertory was somewhat more varied and substantial when he participated in seven concerts at the Metropolitan Opera House during approximately the same period, although he tended to repeat selections in successive appearances. In the first concert, taking place on November 22, 1914, just a few days after his Metropolitan Opera debut, he sang O du, mein holder abendstern from Wagner's Tannh√§user and Air du tambour major from Thomas's Le Ca√Ød. In subsequent concerts, he was heard in Wotan's Farewell from Wagner's Die Walk√ºre, Walter Damrosch's celebrated song Danny Deever, and Why Do the Nations from Handel's Messiah and Largo al factotum from Rossini's Il Barbiere di Siviglia, the last two figuring in his final appearance at the house on November 19, 1916. Middleton's most important operatic assumption came not with the Metropolitan Opera but rather with the Chicago Opera Company; he created the role of Ramatzin in Henry Hadley's opera Azora, the Daughter of Montezuma, which had its world premiere in Chicago in December 1917 and its New York premiere on January 26, 1918. The latter performance, which took place at the Lexington Theater, was part of the Chicago company's first New York season since 1914; Middleton did not participate in another New York debut that opened the series, Mascagni's Isabeau, which had achieved its American debut in Chicago only a few months before. Neither work entered the standard repertory, although Isabeau has clung to its fringes while Azora promptly disappeared entirely. The New York Times, in its review published January 28, 1918, wrote, \\"Arthur Middleton, a well-known baritone, also made an excellent figure of the noble Tlascalan's rival, the Mexican General Ramatzin.\\" Middleton appears to have engaged in an active concert career involving widespread travel within the United States. His documented appearances include the following: *Mankato, Minnesota, December 25, 1912: Soloist in Handel's Messiah together with soprano Mable Sharp Herdien, contralto Genevieve Wheat, and tenor Edward Strong; the organist was Roger Mintener, and Emil Oberhoffer conducted.Churchyard/Orr Family Museum (Genealogy) -- E: Miriam Florence Best, Doings Diary 1911-1913 -- Part 2 at www.crossmyt.com *New York, October 29, 1917: Middleton's first New York song recital, given at Aeolian Hall, included Where'er You Walk from Handel's Semele; Schubert's Der Wanderer; the same Thomas and Rossini arias noted above; and lighter fare including old English airs, Hotner's Uncle Rom, Lucy Broadwood's Old Surrey Air, and \\"ballads from Kipling\\", presumably including Danny Deever.

Triana's career as an artist has spanned nearly six decades and includes works on paper, paintings, sculpture, mixed-media collage, installations, and photography. Triana currently resides in New York City and is still actively creating artwork. Early life and education Gladys Triana Perez was born to Jos√© Daniel Triana and Francisca Maria Perez on November 17, 1937, in Camag√ºey, Cuba.Triana, Gladys Cintas Foundation Artist Biography for Gladys Triana Triana has two siblings, Jos√© Triana,Triana, Jos√© Cintas Foundation Artist Biography for Jos√© Triana a well-recognized Cuban playwright and poet who currently resides in Paris, France, and Lyda Elena Triana Perez, an actress who performed in Cuba and Spain, and eventually became a messo singer in the chorus Zarzuela and the Teatro Real, in Madrid. When she was 6 years old, Triana‚Äôs family moved to Bayamo, Cuba, for her father‚Äôs job, where she attended primary school. She lived in Bayamo until 1959, when she moved to Havana, Cuba. In Havana, Triana worked in the Department of Design at the Instituto Nacional de la Industria Turistica. In 1957, Triana began taking courses in the philosophy department at the University of Santiago de Cuba. In 1969, facing increasing pressure on artists to conform to standards set by government oversight, Triana left Cuba and lived in Madrid, Spain for 5 years. In Madrid, Triana studied printmaking at the San Fernando University. In 1974, Triana was invited to exhibit her work in New York City, at Sarduy Gallery. She returned to New York in 1975 and has lived there since then. Triana completed her BA in Education at Mercy College in 1976 and her MA in Education at Long Island University in 1977. Life and Artwork Triana's relationship with art began as a child. During primary school, Triana was captivated by the contrast between light and shadow, and began sketching shadows of objects with charcoal and pencil. At sixteen years old, Triana began to experiment with black, white, and gray oil painting, and by 1955 she began sketching members of her family with colored pencil and charcoal. In addition to visual art, Triana developed a profound interest in music, specifically classical orchestral works, having been exposed to concerts from a young age. She was inspired by Mario Carre√±o, the director of the Museo de Bellas Arte in Havana, when he visited Santiago de Cuba in 1957. During his visit, Carre√±o selected Triana for her first group exhibition at the Museo de Bellas Artes in Havana, Cuba called ‚Äú5 Painters from Oriente.‚Äù At the age of twenty-one, Triana left Bayamo to live in Havana, where she began to paint on a daily basis and met Eduardo Abela, who would become her mentor. In 1962, and 1963, she was invited to exhibit at the Havana Lyceum. In 1964, Triana‚Äôs work was exhibited in a group show at the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes de La Habana. She continued to exhibit throughout local art centers in Havana until her departure from Cuba in 1969. Upon moving to Madrid, Triana continued to paint daily. Triana attended San Fernando University‚Äôs printmaking program, where she met a group of young artists with whom she would eventually travel throughout Eastern Europe in August 1970. The month-long trip, which departed from Madrid, spanned a number of Italian Renaissance art centers, including Milan, Florence, Rome, Ravenna, Uffizi, and Pompeii. Upon her return, Triana continued to exhibit her work locally in Madrid. In 1974, Triana was invited to exhibit at Sarduy Gallery in New York, and returned to New York in 1975, where she has resided continuously since. Triana mentions Goya, Rembrandt, and Caravaggio as classical influences on her work, as well as modern artists such as Duchamp, Bacon and works from the Futurism movement. Through various stages in her artistic career, Triana has focused on visual expressions of movement, fragmentation, and transformation. An example of this recurring expression is a series of drawings composed during the late 1980s in homage to women artists such as To K√§the Kollwitz (1987), To Aleksandra Ekster (1988), To Paula Modersohn-Becker (1988), To Gabriela Mistral, and others. Her artwork includes prints, drawings, collages, works on canvas, photography, installations and videos.

Actress Barbara Parkins, who starred in the motion picture, suggested that Warwick be considered to sing the film's theme song. The song was to be given to Judy Garland, who had been fired from the film. Warwick performed the song, and when the film became a success in the early weeks of 1968, her single of the film theme became a million-seller, peaking at #2 for four weeks on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 (kept out of the first position by \\"Love is Blue\\" by Paul Mauriat and \\"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay\\" by Otis Redding). It also reached #2 on the Easy Listening charts in early 1968,Whitburn, Joel (2004). The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits, 8th Edition (Billboard Publications), page 669. #2 on the Cash Box Top 100 and #1 on the Record World chart. The song was the B-side of another million selling tune composed for Warwick by Burt Bacharach and Hal David, \\"I Say a Little Prayer,\\" which hit the Billboard Hot 100 Top 5 in November 1967. The single would become one of the biggest double-sided hits of the rock era. Warwick re- recorded a Pat Williams-arranged and Burt Bacharach-produced version of the theme at A&R; Studios in New York because contractual restrictions from her home label, Scepter Records, would not allow her version from the film to be included in the 20th Century-Fox soundtrack album. The re-recorded version became a million-seller. The RIAA-certified Gold Scepter LP that contained the hit version of the song, Dionne Warwick in Valley of the Dolls, peaked at number six on the Billboard Top 10 Albums chart, and would remain on the chart for over a year. In the UK \\"(Theme from) Valley of the Dolls\\" had a February 1968 release with \\"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\\" as the B-side, peaking at UK #28.

Musicians count time in chunks that feel right and make sense. And there are a lot of chunks in this song! The verse changes time sig every measure: 4/4 + 3/4 + 2/4 + 3/4 + 5/4. (Yes, that adds up to 17 beats per verse.) Like this: When did I get, (4 beats) where did I (3 beats) How was I (2 beats) caught in this (3 beats) game? (5 beats) When will I know, (4 beats) where will I (3 beats) How will I (2 beats) think of my (3 beats) name? (5 beats) If the songwriters set up this elaborate scheme just to show off their skill, it probably wouldn‚Äôt have worked. But the ‚Äúincomplete‚Äù 3-beat and two-beat measures reflect the halting, fragmented nature of the lyrics. Gotta get off, gonna get Have to get off from this ride Gotta get hold, gonna get Need to get hold of my pride Starting with the second verse, a soft eighth-note percussion sound (hi-hat? shaker?) supplies a subtle, steady breadcrumb trail through the changes. And the chorus (‚ÄúIs this a dream‚Ä¶?‚Äù) settles down to an alternating four bars of 4/4 and four bars of 3/4 ‚Äî solid footing compared to the verse. The bass player‚Äôs role in this song can‚Äôt be underestimated. It‚Äôs mostly an ostinato part (repeating the same note under chord changes). And it‚Äôs sparse. With such a complex time scheme, the bass can‚Äôt possibly form a steady, unvarying pulse throughout, but it alternates between pulsing and putting a foot down on those off-the-path stepping stones in a way that provides a smooth ‚Äî but not boring ‚Äì passage.

The Search for the Secret Of Qumran is a book by Norman Golb which intensifies the debate over the origins of the Dead Sea Scrolls, furthering the opinion that the scrolls were not the work of the Essenes, as other scholars claim, but written in Jerusalem and moved to Qumran in anticipation of the Roman siege in 70 AD.

Golb states that \\"Vermes could not possibly have avoided knowing of the financial agreement that facilitated the transfer of photographs\\" (p. 236), and that Vermes' statement of November 8, 1991, \\"directly contradicted the position taken by him and the [Oxford] Centre in the [London] Times correspondence published three months earlier\\" (p. 237). The chapter also describes how Vermes used the media \\"to promote his support for the traditional Essene hypothesis,\\" but showed \\"disdain\\" for the similar use of the media by Dr. Robert Eisenman to promote a different view (p. 241). *# Myth and Science in the World of Qumranology *# The deepening Scrolls Controversy *# The New York Conference and Some Academic Intrigues *# The importance of the Dead Sea Scrolls Reception  Reviews Writing in Church History, Gregory T. Armstrong stated: \\"This book is 'must reading' for every historian regardless of her or his period of specialization. It demonstrates how a particular interpretation of an ancient site and particular readings of ancient documents became a straitjacket for subsequent discussion of what is arguably the most widely publicized set of discoveries in the history of biblical archaeology... Especially interesting is the account of events related to the exhibition of scroll fragments in the United States in 1993-1994. What is most distressing here is the reluctance of so many parties to the scrolls controversy‚Äîby then widely publicized‚Äîto engage in a full and free discussion of the many questions which had arisen.\\"Armstrong, Gregory T. Church History Vol. 64, No. 4 (1995), pp. 635-636. Armstrong further states: \\"I find Golb's argument that the site has all the characteristics of a military fort compelling.... Numerous considerations point to the First Jewish War or Revolt, probably the months just prior to the siege of Jerusalem, as the occasion for the hiding of the Scrolls... There was a widespread effort to preserve the Jews‚Äô religious and intellectual heritage and we are the unintended beneficiaries... If Golb has an agenda, it is his concern that many of the scholars associated with the Dead Sea scrolls from the outset and until quite recently held or were influenced by 'the entrenched belief that the culture of the Jews mattered relatively little, and that urban civilization was a force inimical to it' (p. 171). These scholars could not accept or possibly even conceive the extent of the literature associated with Jerusalem before the destruction of the Second Temple by the Romans. Golb goes on to lay out in commendable detail the controversies surrounding the scrolls and their publication as well as their interpretation.\\" Reviewing the British edition of the work, Daniel O'Hara stated that Golb \\"gives us much more than just a fresh and convincing interpretation of the origin and significance of the Qumran Scrolls. His book is also ‚Äî among other things ‚Äî a fascinating case-study of how an idee fixe, for which there is no real historical justification, has for over 40 years dominated an elite coterie of scholars controlling the Scrolls, who have not only sought to restrict access to those who are prepared to toe their party-line, but have abused and rubbished those 'heretics' who have attempted to place a different interpretation on them.\\"O'Hara, Daniel, New Humanist, Vol. III, No. 2 (June 1996), pp. 22-23. O'Hara further states: \\"The unfortunate stranglehold of the 'Essene-hypothesis' has been maintained in official circles, and promulgated in important international exhibitions, right into the present decade.... This most welcome, lucid and passionate book will no doubt come to be seen as a watershed in the process of liberating the scrolls from the Procrustean bed which has restricted their availability and hindered their proper evaluation for almost half a century. For all it tells us about the Scrolls themselves, the general reader will perhaps find it even more gripping for its detailed and fascinating dissection of some particularly disgraceful episodes in academic politics. As such, it both deserves and will receive a much wider readership than those primarily interested in the Qumran library.\\" The Publisher Weekly, refers to this book as disputing the conventional wisdom that Dead Sea Scrolls related to the communal sect of the Essenes, and that their presumed monastery is actually a Jewish fortress. It also refers to Golb's belief that the \\"scrolls and related fragmentary manuscripts embody a wide spectrum of doctrines, genres and themes, from a Hebrew hymn by a Jewish nationalist poet to an apocalyptic brotherhood initiation to an inventory of documents stashed away in the Judaean wilderness\\"Publisher Weekly: \\"The Dead Sea Scrolls, discovered in 1947 in caves in the village of Qumran, now on Jordan's West Bank, have been linked to the Essenes, an ancient Jewish pacifist, communal sect, and some scholars have suggested that Jesus may have been an Essene. Golb, professor of Jewish history and civilization at the University of Chicago, disputes the conventional wisdom in an engrossing, closely argued study. In his rival theory, Palestinian Jews, fearful of the impending Roman siege of Jerusalem in AD 70, took or copied manuscripts from Jerusalem's libraries, smuggled them out of the city and hid them at Qumran, Massada and other sites. Moreover, the presumed Essene monastery of Qumran was actually a Jewish rebel fortress, argues Golb, who marshals archaeological, historical and textual evidence, including his own fieldwork at Qumran and his work on the scrolls. He believes the scrolls and related fragmentary manuscripts embody a wide spectrum of doctrines, genres and themes, from a Hebrew hymn by a Jewish nationalist poet to an apocalyptic brotherhood initiation to an inventory of documents stashed away in the Judaean wilderness.\\" A seminar on the Scrolls dated July 14, 2000, hosted by Australia's ABC Radio National's host Rachael Kohn with Dead Sea Scrolls scholars Geza Vermes, Lawrence Schiffman and Emanuel Tov, refers to this book as \\"An important dissenting opinion: Golb refuses to accept the 'consensus view' that Qumran was the site of the Essenes sect, and that they owned and wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls, but instead argues that Qumran was a fortress like others in the area and that the library of scrolls was from the Jerusalem Temple.\\" (The book, however, at pp. 159‚Äì60, specifically rejects the idea that the scrolls came from the Jerusalem Temple, attributing this theory to Karl Rengstorf and asserting that Rengstorf had failed to \\"conceive of other libraries in Jerusalem whose owners could equally well have hidden away their contents.\\") A New York Times article of December 24, 2002 quotes Katharina M. Galor, a Brown University archaeologist specialized on Qumran, as stating of the Dead Sea Scrolls that \\"There is no new consensus... Or the new consensus is that the old consensus is dead.\\" Craig W. Beard, of the University of Alabama Library, writes in its review that appeared in Library Journal that \\"Contrary to scholarly consensus, Golb contends that, rather than being the product of sectarian scribes, the Dead Sea Scrolls were the work of individuals from many diverse groups and that they were deposited in the caves near the Dead Sea (among other locations) by Jews fleeing the Roman army during the First Revolt\\" and that although the book is based in historical, archaeological, and paleographical evidence, \\"he also lets readers in on his personal efforts to question and oppose the scholarly status quo, leaving the impression of being self-serving.\\"Beard, Craig, W., Library Journal: \\"Contrary to scholarly consensus, Golb contends that, rather than being the product of sectarian scribes, the Dead Sea Scrolls were the work of individuals from many diverse groups and that they were deposited in the caves near the Dead Sea (among other locations) by Jews fleeing the Roman army during the First Revolt (c. 70 c.e.). He also claims that the Qumran complex served not as an Essene monastery but as a fortress for Jews involved in the revolt. This is primarily a scholarly work (though it is not beyond the grasp of nonspecialists). Golb marshalls historical, archaeological, and paleographical evidence to support his arguments. Unfortunately, he also lets readers in on his personal efforts to question and oppose the scholarly status quo, leaving the impression of being self-serving. Because of growing public interest in the scrolls and dissatisfaction with traditional theories about them, this work should be in both public and academic collections.\\" Ilene Cooper from Booklist suggest that public libraries carry this book for \\"its provocative assertions.\\"Cooper, Ilene, Booklist: There has been a spate of new books about the Dead Sea scrolls since their recent \\"liberation\\" from the small group of scholars who were originally granted exclusive access to the historic documents. The prevalent theory among those first researchers was that the scrolls were the work of the Essenes, an ascetic sect that presumably had a settlement near where the scrolls were found. Golb, a professor of Jewish history and civilization at the University of Chicago, has a different theory. He claims that the scrolls were the work of many different groups and were moved to the Judaean wilderness during the Roman siege of Jerusalem in 70 AD. He also argues that the supposed Essene monastery was actually a Jewish fortress. Golb's scholarly credentials are both a plus and a minus. He obviously has plenty of archaeological and historical evidence to back up his claims, but he also writes like an academician, and despite the book's catchy title and subtitle, it will take more than the casual reader to plow through Golb's dense prose. Public libraries that can only afford one scrolls tome should stick with Understanding the Dead Sea Scrolls (1992), edited by Hershel Shanks, but those with active religion or archaeology collections will want this one for its provocative assertions\\" Citations G√©za Vermes, wrote in his An Introduction to the Complete Dead Sea Scrolls (2000), that Golb is responsible for \\"another forceful attack on the common view,\\" an attack which Golb has furthered in several papers since 1980, and which culminated in his book. Vermes asserts that the target of Golb's criticism is the provenance of the manuscripts found at Qumran, his hypothesis being that the manuscripts originated in a Jerusalem library or libraries which were concealed in caves when the capital was besieged by the Romans, and that these manuscripts have nothing to do with Qumran, or with the Essenes. David Fiensy (2007) cites Golb's book for \\"the view that the scrolls represent Judaism in general and not a sect\\", citing A. Dupont-Somer, N. Avigad and E. L. Sukenik, F. M. Cross, D. Flusser, H. Stegemann, G. Vermes, J. Fitzmyer, J.C. VaderKam, Edrdmans, F. G. Martinez, J. H. Charlesworth, and C. M. Murphy for the view that the Qumran sectarian where Essenes, and Schiffman for the view that the scrolls were written by Sadducees. William Edward Arnal and Michel Robert Desjardins in their Whose Historical Jesus? (1997) cites the book while comparing the different hypotheses on the \\"Qumranites\\", citing other scholars such as James H. Charlesworth (Jesus and the Dead Scrolls, 203) who judges that the Qumranites were one of the Essenes groups, and Hartmut Stegemann. \\"Qumran und das Judentum zur Zeit Jesu\\" 84 (1994): 175-94 as basing \\"his support of the Essene hypothesis of factors of hierarch, initiation rites, community of goods, ritual baths, a common meal and views on marriage as well as calendar.\\" They then refer to the alternative estimate of Golb, \\"that the scrolls came from Jerusalem to a fortress in Qumran during the siege of Jerusalem around 70 CE \\"Qumranites\\" refers to those who sponsored the Dead Sea Scrolls and where responsible for placing them in the caves near the Dead Sea. Not all manuscripts found in caves 1 ro 11 where of Qumranite origin. There is enough unity among the manuscripts, however to represent a \\"Qumran library\\" (i.e., \\"Qumran scrolls\\") and a Qumranite view of things. See Charlesworth, ed., Jesus and the Dead Sea Scrolls (New York: Doubleday, 1992) for a list of common features of the scrolls that reflect international and critical scholarly consensus. This study will work from the position that Qumranites represent a group closely parallel to the Essenes described by Josephus, Philo and Pliny the Elder. I do not equate the sponsors of the Qumran scroll with the Essenes; the descriptions In Philo, Piny and Josephus warrant caution in assuming they are the same group. Many others scholars (See Charlesworth, Jesus and the Dead Scrolls, 203), judge that the Qumranites were one of the Essenes groups; for example see Hartmut Stegemann. \\"Qumran und das Judentum zur Zeit Jesu\\" 84 (1994): 175-94, who bases his support of the Essene hypothesis of factors of hierarch, initiation rites, community of goods, ritual baths, a common meal and views on marriage as well as calendar.

In Bales' case he was accused of having purchased land in Markham, Ontario in 1969 while the Cabinet was considering development plans in the area. Bales offered to resign from cabinet but his resignation was refused. The incidents resulted in Davis issuing the province's first conflict of interest guidelines for cabinet ministers and later parliamentary assistants to follow. He was dropped from cabinet in 1974 during a major cabinet shuffle. Bales cited declining health and a minor heart attack in 1973 as the reasons for requesting a reduction in his responsibilities.

His father was Oba Ologun Kutere and his siblings were Obas Osinlokun and Adele. Ascendancy Oba Oluwole was killed in 1841 when lighting triggered an explosion at the Oba's place. Kingmakers would have invited Prince Kosoko to become Oba but his whereabouts were unknown. Further, a feud between Eletu Odibo and Kosoko prevented the Eletu from ensuring that Kosoko would be king. Consequently, Akitoye (Kosoko's uncle and younger brother to Osinlokun) was installed as Oba of Lagos. Madam Tinubu, the powerful merchant and slave trader who was previously married to Adele, supported Akitoye, her brother-in-law's installation as Oba over that of Kosoko.  Akitoye's ouster by Kosoko In an attempt at reconciliation (met with fierce resistance from chiefs, not least Eletu Odibo) with his nephew, Oba Akitoye naively recalled Kosoko to Lagos. Kosoko returned to Lagos aboard the ship of the famous slave trader Jose Domingo Martinez. Akitoye tried to placate Kosoko with gifts and granted him the title Oloja of Ereko or owner of Ereko. Kosoko quickly consolidated his position and found support among many war chiefs and among the Muslim community. Eletu Odibo was concerned about Kosoko's power consolidation and departed for Badagry. In turn, Akitoye recalled Eletu Odibo from Badagry, leading Kosoko to declare that if Eletu Odibo returned to Lagos, he would \\"make himself king\\". A war of words ensued between Oba Akitoye and Prince Kosoko. Kosoko sent his crier around Lagos singing \\"Tell that little child at court yonder to be careful; for if he is not careful he will be punished\\". Akitoye, in turn, deployed his crier singing \\"I am like a pin firmly driven into the ground, which is always hard to root out but ever remains firm\\". Kosoko retorted \\"I am the digger who always roots out a pin\\". The tensions led to an uprising named Ogun Olomiro (Salt Water War) by the Kosoko faction in July 1845. The Kosoko faction laid siege to the Oba's Palace for three weeks. Akitoye eventually accepted defeat, escaped up the lagoon to the north, and was granted safe passage through the Agboyi Creek by Oshodi Tapa, Kosoko's war captain. Oshodi Tapa explained Akitoye's escape to Kosoko by saying that Akitoye put his enemies in a trance. Akitoye thereafter arrived in Abeokuta where he was granted asylum. Recognizing Akitoye's escape as a threat, Kosoko demanded Akitoye's head from the Egbas who refused Kosoko's demands. In December 1845, the Egbas provided the now deposed Akitoye with an escort to Badagry, the traditional town of refuge for Lagosians where he rallied his followers and built a partnership with European missionaries and with the British through their Consul John Beecroft. Madam Tinubu and other Akitoye allies fled to Badagry upon Kosoko's accession to the Lagos throne. Exile at Badagry, alliance with British, and strategic about- face on slavery After mounting a failed offensive from Badagry to retake Lagos, Akitoye turned to the British, specifically to the Governor of Cape Coast requesting intervention on his behalf in exchange for conforming to British regulation on trade (including abolition). In December 1850, Akitoye again appealed for British aid > My humble prayer...is, that you would take Lagos under your protection, that > you would plant the English flag there, and that you would re-establish me > on my rightful throne at Lagos and protect me under my flag; and with your > help I promise to enter into a Treaty....to abolish the Slave Trade...and to > establish and carry on lawful trade, especially with English merchants British intervention in Lagos, December 1851 resulting in Akitoye's second term as Oba A confluence of interests in Lagos from the now deposed Akitoye who allied himself with the anti-slavery cause in order to get British support, the Anglican missionaries in Badagry who were in contact with Akitoye, and Egba and European traders who wanted freer movement of goods ratcheted up British intervention in Lagos. Akitoye's anti-slavery position appears born of self-interest considering his connection with the well known slave trader Domingo Martinez who backed Akitoye's unsuccessful attack on Lagos in 1846. On December 26, 1851, in what is now known as the Bombardment of Lagos or Reduction of Lagos, HMS Bloodhound, HMS Teazer, and a flotilla of boats mounted an attack on the Oba's palace. Kosoko put up a spirited defense but by December 28, 1851 the battle known locally as Ogun Ahoyaya or Ogun Agidingbi (after boiling cannons) was over with Kosoko and his followers fleeing to Ijebu. Consequently, Akitoye was installed Oba of Lagos. On January 1, 1852 Akitoye signed the Treaty between Great Britain and Lagos abolishing the slave trade. Death and legacy Akitoye died on September 2, 1853 and was succeeded by his son, Oba Dosunmu. Dosunmu believed Akitoye was poisoned by Kosoko's loyal chiefs: Oshodi Tapa, Ajenia, and Ipossu.Jean Herskovits raises the possibility that Akitoye may have committed ritual suicide, fitting the traditional pattern of rulers taking their own lives after failing to meet expectations; Akitoye may have realized that his bargain with the British significantly reduced his influence in Lagos. To commemorate his death, the first ever Eyo procession was held in Lagos. Akitoye's grandson Ibikunle Akitoye reigned as Oba of Lagos from 1925-1928.

Fairhaven is an area of Norway. Generally speaking, it is the area between Amsterdam Island and Danes Island and the mainland, while specifically it refers to the sound between Danes Island and the mainland (Albert I Land), in particular the strait between Mose√∏ya and Danes Island. The modern name for this area is Smeerenburgfjorden (a modern blunder, as Smeerenburg was only a settlement). The fjord is 20 km long and 4 km wide. The sound and Albert I Land History Willem Barentsz was the first to explore the area around Fairhaven in 1596. The first indisputable visit by the English was made by Jonas Poole in the Amity in 1610. Thomas Marmaduke is known to have explored the area north of Fairhaven in 1612, and may have explored Fairhaven itself as well. Again, the following season (1613), Marmaduke explored as far north as Fairhaven. The first known whaling here occurred in 1614, with the Dutch resorting to Amsterdam Island and the English to the south. Here they both establish temporary whaling stations, the former most likely on the southeastern spit of Amsterdam Island, and the latter probably on the southeastern corner of Danes Island. In 1615, they again made their way to their respective anchorages in Fairhaven. In 1619 and 1620 there were also at least two Danish ships sharing the southern area with the English. The English continued to send ships to Fairhaven until 1624 or 1625, when the Dutch took over the area. In 1619 the Dutch replaced the tents and temporary tryworks on Amsterdam Island with permanent structures of wood and brick, in what would become known as Smeerenburg, or \\"Blubbertown.\\" At first only the men of Amsterdam and the Danes established themselves on the island, with the former claiming the east and the latter the west. By 1623 several chambers of the Noordsche Compagnie had erected structures for the processing and warehousing of whale oil, and by 1633 all the chambers were represented. Up to 200 men worked ashore during the peak years in the mid-1630s. The settlement began to decline in the early 1640s, and was probably abandoned in the following decade. In 1636, another station, called the \\"Cookery of Harlingen\\", was established by the Dutch in Houcker Bay (Virgohamna) on the north side of Danes Island. The remains of this station were seen by Frederich Martens in 1671. In 1888/1889 Arnold Pike wintered in a hut he built on almost the exact site of the former station. In 1896 Herr Andr√©e established himself here in an attempt to reach the North Pole by balloon, but was forced to return to Sweden. He returned to Houcker Bay the following summer (1897), and accompanied by two others, left Houcker Bay on July 11 in the balloon Eagle. They were never heard of again. Parties from Andr√©e‚Äôs ship, the Virgo, surveyed Fairhaven and the surrounding area. Cartography S√∏rgattet, the southwestern entrance to Fairhaven. The land is Reuschhalv√∏ya, a peninsula of Albert I Land. Fairhaven was named by Poole in 1610. The name is marked on the maps of Daniel (1612), Carolus (1614), Goos (1620), Guerard (1628), Vrolicq (1634), Carolus (1634), Colom (1648), and others. The Dutch called it Dutch Bay or Mauritius Bay, while Carolus (1614) marked it Hollandsche Bay. Although Mauritius Bay appears not to have been marked until Doncker‚Äôs local map (1655), it was written of frequently and early on in Dutch official documents. As previously mentioned, Smeerenburgfjorden is a modern blunder. Fairhaven was further divided north and south. The Englishman Robert Fotherby (1614) simply split the area into a \\"north harbor,\\" where the Dutch established themselves, and a \\"south harbor,\\" where the English were. The Dutch referred to the area northeast of Smeerenburg between the mainland and the island as North gat or North Bay, while they called the area where the English were English Bay or English harbor. The southwestern entrance to Fairhaven, between Danes Island and the mainland south of it, was first designated South gat by Doncker (1655), which is where the modern name, S√∏rgattet, comes from. Amsterdam Island was first landed on by Barents in 1596. He named the island and the group of islands around it Gebroocken Land. It was probably first named Amsterdam Island in or after 1614, when the Dutch whalers first resorted to the island. The sound south of Amsterdam Island, between it and Danes Island, was variously named South bay, West bay, or Middel gat by the Dutch. It incorrectly became known as Danes gat by modern writers, and is now designated as Danskegattet. Martin Conway believes that the correct historical name is Middel gat. Danes Island is first marked on Doncker‚Äôs map (1655). It is named after the Danish whalers who resorted there. On the island‚Äôs west coast, in Robbe Bay (Kobbefjorden), they established a permanent station in 1631, which they occupied until 1658. Robbe Bay is first marked on Dutch maps from Middelhoven‚Äôs (1634) to that of Giles and Rep (c. 1710). The latter mapmakers were the first to call it Danes Bay, while the Danish themselves called it Copenhagen Bay. The English called the islands southwest point Gurnerd‚Äôs Nose, while the Dutch called it Engelsche Uytkyk, or English Outlook. The bay in the north coast was called by the Dutch Houcker Bay, but has been renamed Virgo Bay (Virgohamna) after Andr√©e‚Äôs steamer. Off the northeastern coast lays a small island, which the Dutch called Deadman‚Äôs Island, which, as the name suggests, was used as a graveyard by the whalers. It is now known by its Norwegian equivalent, Likholmen (Corpse Island). Modern Fairhaven South of Fuglesongen, Klovningen, and Ytre Norsk√∏ya modern charts wrongly mark Fairhaven. As mentioned in the introduction, the true Fairhaven is the area to the south between Amsterdam Island and Danes Island and the mainland. References The Place Names of Svalbard.

(1996). What is vocology? Logopedics Phoniatrics Vocology, 21:5-6. Its concerns include the nature of speech and language pathology, the defects of the vocal tract (laryngology), the remediation of speech therapy, and the voice training (voice therapy) and voice pedagogy of song and speech for actors and public speakers. In its broadest sense, vocology is the study of voice, but as a professional discipline it has a narrower focus: the science and practice of voice habilitation, which includes evaluation, diagnosis, and intervention. History Vocology was invented (simultaneously, but independently) by Ingo Titze, and an otolaryngologist at Washington University, Prof. George Gates. Titze defines vocology as \\"the science and practice of voice habilitation, with a strong emphasis on habilitation\\". To habilitate means to ‚Äúenable‚Äù, to ‚Äúequip for‚Äù, to ‚Äúcapacitate‚Äù; in other words, to assist in performing whatever function that needs to be performed\\". He goes on that this \\"is more than repairing a voice or bringing it back to a former state ... rather, it is the process of strengthening and equipping the voice to meet very specific and special demands\\". Requirements and educational programs It is not yet its own professional degree, thus it only assists the voice medicine team. Usually a person practicing vocology is a voice coach with additional training in the voice medical arts, a prepared voice/singing teacher, or a speech pathologist with additional voice performance training‚Äîso they can better treat the professional voice user. The study of vocology is recognized academically by courses and institutes in India, Italy and the United States.

VIPR2 is also expressed in the cerebellum.  Function  Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) are homologous peptides that function as neurotransmitters and neuroendocrine hormones.

VIPR2 transduction results in upregulation of adenylate cyclase activity. Furthermore, VIPR2 mediates the anti-inflammatory effects of VIP. Research using VPAC2 knockout mice implicate it in the function of the circadian clock, growth, basal energy expenditure and male reproduction. VIPR2 and/or PAC1 receptor activation is involved in cutaneous active vasodilation in humans. Splice variants may modify the immunoregulatory contributions of the VIP-VIPR2 axis.

The One Australia policy proclaimed a vision of \\"one nation and one future\\". It called for an end to multiculturalism and opposed a treaty with Aboriginal Australians. The policy set the scene for the August 1988 suggestion by Leader of the Opposition John Howard that the rate of Asian immigration to Australia be reduced. History John Howard, Australian Prime Minister 1996‚Äì2007 Howard first flagged the concept of the One Australia policy on a trip to Perth in July 1988, having recently returned from a visit with Margaret Thatcher in Britain. One Australia was to be the name of the Liberal-National Coalition's immigration and ethnic affairs policy. During an interview on the John Laws radio programme on 1 August 1988, Howard detailed the policy, expressing his preference to bias immigration towards skilled applicants rather than family reunion. Later that afternoon, on the ABC PM programme, Howard discussed the policy in relation to Asian immigration to Australia: > I do believe that if it is ‚Äì in the eyes of some in the community ‚Äì that > it's too great, it would be in our immediate-term interest and supporting of > social cohesion if it were slowed down a little, so the capacity of the > community to absorb it was greater. Howard's Shadow Finance Minister, John Stone, elaborated, saying that \\"Asian immigration has to be slowed. It's no use dancing around the bushes\\". Ian Sinclair, National Party leader in the Coalition, also supported the policy, saying: > \\"What we are saying is that if there is any risk of an undue build-up of > Asians as against others in the community, then you need to control it ... I > certainly believe, that at the moment we need ... to reduce the number of > Asians ... We don't want the divisions of South Africa, we don't want the > divisions of London. We really don't want the colour divisions of the United > States.\\" There were widespread objections to the policy from within the Liberal Party, including from Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett, New South Wales Premier Nick Greiner, former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, and former immigration ministers Ian Macphee and Michael MacKellar. The Labor government sought to quickly exploit Howard's Asian remarks by introducing a parliamentary motion rejecting the use of race to select immigrants. Howard opposed this motion. In an unusual show of dissent, three Liberal MPs‚ÄîIan Macphee, Steele Hall and Philip Ruddock‚Äîdefied their leader by crossing the floor and voting with the Labor government. Macphee lost preselection the following year. Criticising his own party's policy, Steele Hall said in a speech to Parliament: > The question has quickly descended from a discussion about the future > migrant intake to one about the level of internal racial tolerance. The > simple fact is that public opinion is easily led on racial issues. It is now > time to unite the community on the race issue before it flares into an ugly > reproach for us all. In a speech to the \\"Terra Australis to Australia\\" conference in Canberra, August 1988, Prime Minister Bob Hawke responded to the Opposition's One Australia policy: > In the field of immigration and ethnic affairs, the \\"One Australia\\" ideology > seems to connote a return to the dark days of narrow minded intolerance, > fear of difference and pressure to assimilate. It is less about uniting > Australians than dividing them. One Australia was officially launched by John Howard on 22 August 1988. The policy document, whose title was personally chosen by Howard, stated the Coalition's ideal to create \\"One Australia and welcome all those who share our vision and are ready to contribute to it\\", detailing a vision of \\"one nation and one future\\" which included the rejection of Aboriginal land rights. In September 1988, John Howard criticised multiculturalism, saying \\"To me, multiculturalism suggests that we can't make up our minds who we are or what we believe in\\", and the idea of an Aboriginal treaty, saying \\"I abhor the notion of an Aboriginal treaty because it is repugnant to the ideals of One Australia\\". One Australia became the centrepiece of Howard's general policy manifesto, \\"Future Directions ‚Äì It's Time for Plain Thinking\\", which was released in December 1988. In a January 1989 interview with Gerard Henderson, Howard elaborated on his reasons for opposing multiculturalism: > The objection I have to multiculturalism is that multiculturalism is in > effect saying that it is impossible to have an Australian ethos, that it is > impossible to have a common Australian culture. So we have to pretend that > we are a federation of cultures and that we've got a bit from every part of > the world. I think that is hopeless. In the months following the release of the One Australia policy, there was a decline in investment in Australia by Asian businesses. Some political commentators later postulated that the dissent within the Liberal Party over immigration policy weakened Howard's leadership position, contributing to him being overthrown as Liberal Party leader by Andrew Peacock. Commentary on the One Australia policy *In 1993, Liberal Party MP, Peter Costello, dismissed the One Australia policy as just \\"a passing policy\\". *In a 2007 article in the British newspaper The Guardian, left wing journalist John Pilger claimed that the One Australia Policy was a forerunner to the One Nation political party.

GPR65 is also referred to as TDAG8.  Species, tissue, and subcellular distribution  GPR65 (TDAG8) is primarily expressed in lymphoid tissues (spleen, lymph nodes, thymus, and leukocytes), and as a GPCR, the protein is localized to the plasma membrane.  Function   Ligand binding  In 2001, GPR65 was reported to be a specific receptor for psychosine (d-galactosyl-Œ≤-1,1‚Ä≤ sphingosine) as well as several other related glycosphingolipids. However, the specific binding of psychosine to GPR65 has been contested as the reported ligand binding did not satisfy the appropriate pharmacological criteria. More recently, 3-[(2,4-dichlorophenyl)methylsulfanyl]-1,6-dimethylpyridazino[4,5-e][1,3,4]thiadiazin-5-one (referred to as BTB09089) was found to be a specific agonist for GPR65. Furthermore, [(S)-phenyl(pyridin-4-yl)methyl] 4-methyl-2-pyrimidin-2-yl-1,3-thiazole-5-carboxylate (referred to as ZINC62678696) was found to act as a BTB09089 negative allosteric modulator.  pH sensing  GPR65 senses extracellular pH. Levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a secondary messenger associated with activation of GPCRs in the cAMP-dependent pathway, were found to be elevated in neutral to acidic extracellular pH (pH 7.0-6.5) in cells expressing GPR65. In cells with mutated GPR65, this pH-sensing effect was reduced or eliminated. In the presence of psychosine, however, the levels of cAMP increased at a shifted, more acidic pH range. As such, psychosine displayed an inhibitory effect as an antagonist when GPR65 was stimulated with an increasing concentration of protons (increasingly acidic pH). This finding directly contested the previous reporting of psychosine as an activating ligand for GPR65. The pH-sensing ability of GPR65 was further tested and confirmed, as it was found that cAMP levels increased when GPR65 was stimulated by pH values less than pH 7.2. GPR65 senses pH by protonation of histidine residues on its extracellular domain, and when activated, GPR65 enables the downstream signaling through the Gq/11, Gs, and G12/13 pathways. The ability of GPR65 to sense pH can modulate several cellular functions in various biological systems including the immune, cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, and nervous systems. GPR65's ability to sense pH plays a prominent role in tumor development. GPR65 is highly expressed in a variety of human tumors. Tumor development is associated with low extracellular pH due to changes in metabolism of rapidly dividing cells. GPR65 enables tumor growth by sensing the acidic environment. It was found that overexpression of GPR65 prevents tumor cell death in acidic conditions in vitro and facilitates tumor growth in vivo.  Immune  GPR65 reduces immune-mediated inflammation by regulating cytokine production of T cells (including IL-6, TNF-Œ± and IL-1Œ≤) and macrophages.  Cardiovascular  After myocardial infarction, anaerobic respiration and severe inflammation occurs‚Äîboth of which are accompanied by an acidic environment. GPR65 knockout mice showed a decline in survival and cardiac function after myocardial infarction, which indicates that GPR65-mediated pH sensing is physiologically relevant. GPR65 exhibits a cardioprotective effect against myocardial infarction by reducing CCL20 expression and the migration of IL-17A-producing Œ≥Œ¥T cells that express CCR6, a receptor for CCL20.  Visual  Retinal function is sensitive to changes in pH. It was found that GPR65 is overexpressed in the retina of mouse models of retinal degeneration and that the receptor supports the survival of photoreceptors in a degenerating retina by sensing pH and activating microglia after light-injury.  Gastrointestinal  Vagal afferents expressing GPR65 innervate intestinal villi. These GPR65-expressing vagal afferents detect nutrients in the intestinal lumen and also slow gut motility.  Depression  GPR65 was identified as a potential target linking inflammation and depression. GPR65 knockout mice exhibited a significant reduction in mobility in a forced swim test as well as higher consumption of sucrose‚Äîboth of which are behaviors associated with depression.  History/Discovery  In 1996, Choi et al. first identified GPR65 (TDAG8) as a G protein-coupled receptor whose expression was induced during activation-induced apoptosis of T cells. The group sought to identify which genes were necessary during T cell receptor-mediated death of immature thymocytes, and using differential mRNA display, they found that TDAG8 expression was induced upon activation of T cells. Because this gene was found to be associated with T-cell death (apoptosis), it was named TDAG8, or T Cell Death Associated Gene 8.

He was buried after a funeral in which the number of mourners set a record in Tangier's biggest ever gatherings. Career It was not a coincidence that Abdelaziz Ben Sediq's mother as well comes from family of known scholars. Her grandfather indeed was Imam Ahmad ibn Ajiba. He started his early education in Tangier and traveled to Cairo and was a student of Azhar scholars such as Mahmoud Imam and Abdul Muuti Sharshimi.

Like his older brothers Ahmad and Abdullah, Abd al-Aziz al-Ghumari was famous for his intellectual sparring with fellow hadith scholar Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani.Muhammad Moin, \\"Ahmed Al-Ghumari on Al-Albani\\". Al- Sunnah: 8 March 2011. View Although Ghumari studied in a Sunni Islamic university, he registered his own critical thinking and came up with views that were unpopular with his teachers in the Azhar University. He used to adopt views based on research even if they were outside the sect or the popular religious culture. Among such views are the following: * Unlike Sunni religious culture where all the companions of prophet Muhammad are venerated, Ghumari used to mention 6 of the companions without venerating them because they fought against Ali The 30th Hadith, Abd al-Aziz al-Ghumari, International Patent number -4-0-9872-9981 Al Bughaz Edition, P 44.

That was repeated over so many pages of the book. * In his book Al-Ittihad (ÿßŸÑÿßÿ™ÿ≠ÿßÿØ) he supported re-introducing tougher penalties for sorcery and related misdeeds. Also like the rest of his family, Ghumari's exact theological viewpoints were difficult to pin down. Although a practitioner of Sufism, he was also critical of other Sufis. Though a Sunni, he and his brothers also held views in juristprudence and dogmatics outside of the mainstream. It is most likely that the Ghumaris had a unique viewpoint of their own.

The very definition of the term \\"sportsboat\\" is evolving. There is an absence of an accepted definition of the term. They tend to be characterised by historically large sail areas for a given length (especially under downwind sails), light weight construction and a heavy reliance on crew weight to counterbalance heeling forces. They usually feature lifting keels (for easy trailerability) of a modern fin and bulb design and planing hull designs. Most sportsboats are self-righting as opposed to skiffs. As similar design philosophies spread into larger classes the length of most sportsboats has come to be considered as between 5.5m and 8m (18'-26'). Boats of a similar design but of larger size have come to be known as sports yachts and are generally in the size range of 9m - 12m. Their noncomformity with traditional designs and concepts and their heterogeneity has made problematical their placement into racing, outside of one design races. Creating handicap systems that match actual sportsboat performance has necessitated new Racing Rules of Sailing and measures. The Australian Measurement System was updated in 2012 with the launch of AMS2 and this has been very successful in updating the mathematics to accommodate modern [traditional] designs. Particularly because of their planing performance (which varies from the hydrodynamics and hull speed of a displacement hull), the Sportsboat Measurement System was specially created to fit the needs of boats within the category. Rig design and sail plan B&R; 23 Sportboats are generally characterised by a tall mast for their hull length, a correspondingly large main sail and non-overlapping jib (a headsail that does not extend rearward past the mast). Many sportsboat designs feature asymmetric spinnakers and, like skiffs, they are often sailed downwind by sailing a series of broad reaches in a shallower zig-zag pattern than with traditional symmetrical spinnakers. As with the large mainsails, spinnakers are also generally much larger for a given hull size than had previously been used. Many sportsboats are fitted with an extendible bowsprit of 4‚Äì8 feet (1.2-2.5m) length, which moves the tack of the spinnaker away forward from the hull and allows better airflow and a larger sail size. Some like the larger Thompsons and Phuket 8 feature a bowsprit that is both extendable as well as articulating - able to move from side to side - which is a system first used by Greg Young in the Bull series of boats, enabling the asym boat to sail at deeper angles downwind as the pole is squared back. For lighter smaller sportboats such as the Shaws, Vipers and wider French boats, the downwind performance aims to get the boats planing as early as possible, and thus the weight saved from using a simple extendable prod only is considered more valuable than the gains from articulation. Hull design Sportboat hulls have many elements in common with skiffs such as an almost flat bottom, a fine bow and a flat aft section - in short, a planing hull form. This very efficient, low-drag shape, combined with the large, powerful rig and sail design and the light weight construction of most sports boats is what gives them their significant speed advantage over traditional designs. To offset the large sail area and the resulting significant heeling momentum there are 3 main design philosophies: 1. a deep and heavy keel; 2. a way to get the crew further off the centreline by using wings, racks, hiking aids or trapezes; and, 3. a reduction in sail area, leading to a reduction in displacement, leading to less need for sail area and thus a reduction in heeling momentum. Many modern sportsboats use some combination of 1&2 or 2&3 also, with option 1 tending to favour upwind legs, and option 3 tending to favour downwind; option 2 being an advantage in all respects except rating. Most sports boats use the modern fin and bulb design, which may also be lifting for ease of storage, as most sportsboats are designed to be taken out of the water on a daily or regular basis. Accommodation Most sportsboats have no or very little on- board accommodation as they are primarily intended to be sailed in short races around laid courses on sheltered waters. They are like track racing cars - intended only for use in races for limited durations. A typical club sportboat race would be between 2 and 3 hours long and the biggest regattas would usually feature 3-4 races a day, each of only 1 to 1.5 hours duration. Cockpits are usually fully open and the only covered area is a very small and spartan fore-cabin (cuddy), usually used only for storing sails and essential safety equipment. Even larger sports yachts which often do have a proper cabin below are often missing all the usual features of a yacht. Sinks, toilets, bunks, water tanks and cooking equipment are usually missing. Often a moulded hard plastic seat on either side of the cuddy and a removable chemical toilet are the only amenities. A number of trailer sailers in the past have attempted to use sportboat like design and construction while retaining the interior cabin volume and amenities; most have ended up being quicker than trailer sailers only due to their stripped out interiors (compared to their competitors with toilets, cookers, cushions, etc.) and have been not competitive against true sportboats. In the larger sizes, there have been a number of sportboats that have managed to achieve both accommodation as well as performance, including the Young Rocket, Stealth designs from Alan Carwadine and various Elliott configurations. Sportsboat-specific handicapping systems Sportsboats at first raced in existing class divisions under existing handicapping systems. As the number of sportsboats continued to grow specific divisions for them have become increasingly common at all levels of racing. In Europe and the USA, the trend has been more for One Design racing where all boats are identical. Rules currently used to rate sportsboats include sportsboat rule SBR which will be discontinued at the end of 2010, and individual country rule systems such as the New Zealand Sportsboat box rule and Australian SMS system. Some boats uses trapezes, racks and wings to increase performance. Heavier designs such as the SB3, J80, Flying Tiger and Platu are competitive in handicap racing, but are significantly slower compared to the lightweight racers. Sportsboat developments worldwide European sportsboats While asymmetric sportsboats had been available for some years (Cork 1720, Bull 7000, Melges 32) sailing in handicap events, the launch of the Tony Castro designed Laser SB3(Dart SB3 in Australia) in 2002 made a huge difference to take-up of sportsboat sailing. The SB3 is one of the most popular sportboats of the modern era with over 600 sold worldwide (mainly in Europe) and it has been the largest class at the annual Cowes Week regatta with over 80 boats. The SB3 widened the appeal of sportsboats by preventing hiking and having a heavier keel providing more stability - making it suitable for a wider range of sailors and over 100 boats attend the annual class regatta which will be held in the UK in 2011 and Australia in 2012. The manufacturers also marketed the boat by putting top Olympic sailors into regattas and by aggressive pricing into some markets (e.g. Ireland) for early adopters - as well as holding an annual race between the class winners at Cowes Week. French sportboats generally sail in handicap events and tend to be similar to the open 60s and open 70s shape; with very wide bodies, rotating rigs, non masthead kites and masts set well back. Examples include the Open 5.70, Open 6.50 and the more recent Karver 650; all of which have twin rudders and many of the other typical features of the larger shorthanded and ocean racer design formats. The Uffa Fox designed Flying Fifteen from 1947 meets most of the criteria used to define a Sportsboat here. Sailed extensively in the UK and Australia, fleets also exist in Belgium, France, Hong Kong, New Zealand, South Africa, and Spain (Majorca). Australia/NZ sportboats Viper 640 flying its spinnaker Popular boat designs in Australia include the Melges 24, Viper 640, Esse 850, Elliott 7, Shaw 650 and Hobie magic 25. More recently, New Zealand and Australian designs have become increasingly popular including various designs by Thompson, the Phuket 8 by Duncanson and a variety of boats by Shaw Yacht design. The Racetrack website has kept relative performance data between a variety of Australian and New Zealand sportboats, in order to assess comparative performance. To date, the fastest sportboats have tended to be the lightest, least ballasted, widest boats, with the Rob Shaw designed 7 and 7.5m designs being the fastest in New Zealand, and the largest 8m Allan Carawadine and Bethwaite designs proving fastest in Australia. The Australian Sports Boat Association is now the body that represents sportboat sailing in Australia. The Association is fully affiliated with Yachting Australia and aims to regulate and promote the racing of sports boats at regattas throughout Australia. ASBA, incorporated in 2007, was founded by sports boats sailors Cameron Rae, Mark Roberts and Richard Parkes. The trio wanted to see a more scientific approach taken to handicapping the various designs racing together. Prior to the formation of ASBA handicaps were considered to be a bit of a lottery. Membership continues to grow with members in every state of Australia. The Association represents a myriad of sports boats including Thompson 7's, 750's and 8's, Elliott 7's and 780's, Shaw 650s, Stealth 7's and 8's, Melges 24's, Hobie magic 25's and a host of other sports boat designs. Using their own new rating system called SMS the Association is aiming to create a level playing field for multiple designs, and to encourage high performance designs without the excessive penalties currently existing in other rating systems. USA sportsboats The Melges 24, launched in 1993 has set the worldwide benchmark for what a modern Sportboat should be. Selling over 800 boats, half this fleet has ended up in the US. The popularity of this boat led to a flurry of designs although none matched the Melges 24 in numbers sold. Other classes designed at that time have endured such as the Ultimate 20 and the Viper 640. During the mid-2000s there has been a resurgence in sportsboats. The Viper 640 has been revived after the class died out and is now one of the fastest growing classes in the US. The Ultimate 20 had a makeover with the adoption of carbon masts. Melges has launched two new models the 32 and 20, both have become popular in international markets. The latest designs have come from the Viper designer Brian Bennett with the VX One and JBoats with their J70 (though due to mediocre downwind performance, most sailors who do not own a J70 do not consider the J70 to be a \\"sportsboat\\" ), which is due to launch later this year, as well as the Shaw 650 which is now also available in USA. Notable incident During the 2011 Chicago Yacht Club Race to Mackinac, the high performance monohull sportsyacht Kiwi 35 WingNuts turtled in an extreme storm, killing the captain and one crew member. This was despite its having an experienced crew. Later inquiry said that the boat specifically its high performance extremely wide low displacement hull was unfit for the location, weather and the multiday and lengthy race, and urged race officials to change ratings and revoke privileges to enter the race.On the other hand, one meteorologist suggested: > \\"Veteran Chicago-Mac racers have encountered similar conditions during > previous races and understand that coping with severe weather is part of the > challenge. Skippers must prepare their boats, train their crew, maintain a > watchful eye for approaching storms and \\"the dearest friend (and most > menacing foe) of all sailors -- the wind.\\" The waves were not all that unusual, although the wind was. The boat may have buried one of its hiking wings into a wave, causing it to 'trip,' and had the other lifted by the wind. It is rare but not unheard of for keelboats to turtle and remain upside down, particularly if it has not lost its keel. However, this boat's unique hull form, which made it very fast, also rendered it more stable upside down than right side up. This was a recipe for the disaster. including a picture of the turtled WingNuts This loss was occasioned despite a competent and experienced crew which was as well equipped and prepared as thought to be necessary. WingNuts met then current offshore stability standards, which failed to adequately take into account the effect of the \\"radical\\" winged hull. \\"On paper, WingNuts met all stability requirements for the Chicago-Mac race. The race required that all boats have an Offshore Racing Rule (ORR) handicap measurement certificate, a document that includes two measures of stability: Limit of Positive Stability (LPS) and the Stability Index (SI). However, after the accident, the US Sailing panel found that the ORR formulas did not adequately penalize the Kiwi 35‚Äôs extreme flare, the difference between the waterline beam and the maximum beam. When the panel eliminated a fixed lower limit for the ‚Äúcapsize increment‚Äù one of the factors used in the calculating stability index WingNuts‚Äô index of 100.7 plummeted to 74.4. No other boat in the race had the same drastic reduction in its stability index when the same math was applied. In addition, the panel noted that the Right Arm Curve (GZ Curve)‚Äîa graphic representation of the boat‚Äôs stability‚Äîrevealed WingNuts to be just as stable inverted as it was right side up, sharply reducing any chance of recovery from a full capsize.\\" One meteorologist suggested these conditions should have been anticipated.: List of sportsboat classes See also *Trailer sailer *Turtling (sailing) *Ultra light displacement boat References Footnotes Endnotes Bibliography  External links * Êó†ÊûÅËç£ËÄÄ-Êó†ÊûÅËç£ËÄÄÂÆòÁΩë- Êó†ÊûÅËç£ËÄÄ‰∏ªÁÆ° * Elliott 7 Class Association * Australian Sportsboat Association * Magic 25 Class Association of Australia * Hong Kong Sportsboats * Laser SB3 Class Association * Shaw 650 sportboat * Open 5.70 Class Association * Viper 640 Class Association * Esse 850 Class Association * New Zealand Sportboat Association * RYA and RORC Sportsboat Rule 2006 Note: Rules updated in 2012 and 2016. * Australia Trailable Yacht & Sportsboat Rule 2008 * Sailing Gallery: Sportsboat video via YouTube Sailboats ","title":"Sportsboat"},{"id":"14428969","text":"Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 4 also known as S1PR4 is a human gene which encodes a G protein-coupled receptor which binds the lipid signaling molecule sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P).

The rally organiser, the Hindu Rights Action Force, had called the protest over alleged discriminatory policies which favour ethnic Malays. The rally was the second such street protest after the 2007 Bersih rally in Kuala Lumpur on 10 November 2007. The rally started when a crowd estimated to be between 5,000 and 30,000 people gathered outside the Petronas Twin Towers at midnight, early Sunday morning. At least 240 people were detained, but half of them were later released. Hindu religious NGOs, including MHS, decided to form a special committee after the burial of Murthi according to Islamic rights, to study and make recommendations on the issues of conversions to Islam, namely grabbing of dead bodies and conversions of children. Mr.P. Waythamoorthy was made the Chairman of this special committee. However, after more cases of temple demolitions and conversions, this committee evolved and saw the formation of Hindraf in June 2007 with the involvement of religious NGO's, politicians and other Indian-based NGO's. Hindraf prepared a memorandum on all issues of the Indian community in Malaysia, starting from the British colonial days,right up to present situation of the Indian community being considered as second rate citizens of the country.They conducted various protests and rallies. Hindraf's proposals to the PM of Malaysia to resolve various issues affecting the plantation workers.MHS made several attempts, together with other Hindu and Indian NGO's through YSS to bring both MIC President and Hindraf leaders together to have a discussion. However, these efforts failed and eventually culminated in the massive Hindraf. Background Religious persecution has been formidable source of marginalization of the people of Indian origin in Malaysia.Between April to May 2006, several Hindu temples were demolished by city hall authorities in the country, accompanied by violence against Hindus.Temple row - a dab of sensibility please,malaysiakini.com On 21 April 2006, the Malaimel Sri Selva Kaliamman Temple in Kuala Lumpur was destroyed by the City Hall authorities because of violation of construction laws. The president of the Consumers Association of Subang and Shah Alam in Selangor State has been helping to organize efforts to stop the local authorities in the Muslim dominated city of Shah Alam from demolishing a 107-year-old Hindu temple. The growing Islamization in Malaysia is a cause for concern to many Malaysians who follow minority religions such as Hinduism. On 11 May 2006, armed city hall officers from Kuala Lumpur forcefully demolished part of a 60-year-old suburban temple that serves more than 1,000 Hindus because iwas builtld illegally. Moreover, the demolition of the Seri Maha Mariamman Temple in Padang Jawa, Shah Alam just a few days before Deepavali which is most important Hindu festival of lights in 2007. Not only that, an interesting case was the attempted demolition of the Sri Kaliamman Temple just outside Angkasapuri, which is the headquarters for Radio Televisyen Malaysia (RTM).The temple was asked to evacuate for security reasons stating that it was a security risk. The President of Temple confirmed that it was authorized by a former Minister of Information that the temple which was built by the staff of RTM remain at its present location which is part of the land of Angkasapuri. As the leader of Hindu delegation in the Committee, he enquired with the National Security Council representatives at the meeting whether the surau or the proposed site for the RM5million new mosque in the Angkasapuri compound was open for the staff only or the public as well. He stated that if the public is allowed to visit this Islamic place of worship, then how does the question of security arise when the temple is outside the compound. To this, the representative answered that it was open to the public as well.On pressing further, there were no answers and the matter was not brought up by the authorities after. The Hindu Rights Action Force or HINDRAF, a coalition of several NGO's, have protested these demolitions by lodging complaints with the Prime Minister of Malaysia but with no response.Hindu group protests 'temple cleansing' in Malaysia ,Financial Express Many Hindu advocacy groups have protested what they allege is a systematic plan of temple cleansing in Malaysia. The official reason given by the Malaysian government has been that the temples were built \\"illegally\\". However, several of the temples are centuries old. According to a lawyer for HINDRAF, a Hindu temple is demolished in Malaysia once every three weeks. Affirmative Action Policy is to ensure the peace and stability in the pluralist society of Malaysia.It was found to address Malay grievances.The government introduced a number of policies to improve the condition of the Bumiputeras in all sectors of life.In 1971 the New Economic Policy was launched, effectively imposing a regime of positive discrimination for Malays in a variety of sectors from education and business to the bureaucracy. Later revisions of this, such as the New Development Plan (1991-2000) as well as the New Vision Policy (2000-2010),all targeted the promotion of the local Malay population.Although, the NEP was meant to eliminate poverty in rural sectors, it had bypassed the private plantation which included the rubber plantation that employed a large number of Indian labourers. Statistics clearly showed that more than 75% of Indians were in 1970 classified as low wages labourers. The socio-economic situation of the Indian Tamil plantation labour in particular was a major concern of the Malaysian Indian Congress(MIC).After Independence,the MIC President Tun V.T.Sambanthan had established the National Land Finance plantations that were facing fragmentation. Without government aid it was considered a gergantuan task,and plea was made to low wages,loss of jobs and homes due to the fragmentation exercise. On 1974 MIC Bluebook, spearheaded by the MIC President V.Manickavasagam, contained key proposals which included increase of Indian share capital, ownership and control achievement of racial balance in public employment, offer of Indian who were restricted under the Employment Act 1968 and abolish the Contract Labour System, allotment of new housing and Introduction of a systematic academic scheme for Tamil schools are recommended under the Aziz Commission Report. The MIC Bluebook proposals indicate the socioeconomic grievances faced by the Indian Tamil plantation labour. The early efforts made by the MIC,none of the Bluebook recommendation were taken into consideration.Following the fragmentation and redevelopment of rubber plantation land,the mid-1980 onward witnessed the gradual urbanization of the Indian Tamil Plantation labour and the continued disregard of this particular class-based group's grievances by government policy and poverty reduction programmes. The situation was found to worsen when rubber plantation were bought over through Permodalan Nasional Berhad(PNB),a Malay trust agency. As such, the complicity between the private corporations and government established an unequal bargaining position between the plantation corporations and the Indian Tamil plantation labour. Without adequate labour representation and political clout, the Indian Tamil plantation labour face serious socio-economic problems such as loss jobs,eviction from estate homes and forced relocation to urban squatters.By the mid-1990s,it was reported that 70.5% of Indians were employed low-waged labour in agricultural, manufacturing and industrial jobs.The forced urbanization had led to the constitution of an urban Indian underclass that as facing social and economic grievances such as urban poverty,lack of education,unemployment and social problems such as the escalation of crime among youths. The development programmes initiated under the National Development Policy(NDP) and the socioeconomic programmes under the NEP had failed to consider the socioeconomic situation of the Indian Tamil plantation labour as it was outside purview of the race-basd affirmative action policy. Political Representation.MIC is the biggest India political party and a constituent of the rulling coalition government at the centre since independence does not have much political clout and has not been able to do anything substantial to improve the lot of the Indians. Indian non- governmental organizations(NGOs),community and self-help groups among the urban Indian middle class have attempted to solve the socio-economic problems faced by the former Indian Tamil plantation labour. However, contemporary Indian civil society is generally divided due to differences in ideology.The class-based approach taken by community groups such as Alaigal and JERIT have successfully mobilized the Indian Tamil Plantation labour to seek their legal rights against unlawful eviction from homes and to obtain adequate and fair compensation for retrenchment from plantation jobs. The urban Indian middle class had lost confidence in the political elites of the MIC who was seen as having a weak bargaining clout within the communal Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition. The race-based politics of the BN was seen to have failed in resolving the serious issues faced by class based group among the Indians. Moreover, the unresolved Kampung Medan incident in 2001, which was reported to be a series of clashes between the Indian and Malay residents in the poorer urban settlement of Kampung Medan in the state of Selangor, had deeply affected both the urban Indian underclass as well as the urban Indian middle- class. The failure of the Malaysian Human Rights Commission to investigate the causes of the incident had further exacerbated the loss of confidence in the government. Indian civil society had viewed the incident as a mob attack against the Malaysian Human Rights Commission for falling to hold an inquiry on the matter. The High Court in the case took a restrictive approach in inter receptivity to public policy reference to the victims of the Kampung Medan incident as being of Indian origin and of Tamil ethnicity, the court replied that: \\"Whatever one uses to describe those victims,it makes not a whit of a difference. The judiciary disregarded the class based as well as the race based identity of the victims and only took into consideration the technically of legal procedural arguments.The judgement also meant that the victims of Kampong Medan did not have any further recourse to justice. The issue of forced religious conversion has also been at the forefront. The trigger incidents were the 2007 series of legal cases involving the custody rights of non-Muslim Indian mothers against the unilateral rights of their newly converted Muslims husbands to convert their children to Islam. The two legal battles that became a serious concern among the Indians were Shamala's case in 2003, and Subashini's case in 2007. Inboth,h the cases, the originally Hindu husband converted to Islam and the attempted to unilaterally convert their children to Islam without the non-Muslims wife's legal permission. There are many such cases of conversion to Islam either voluntary or forced upon the ethnic Indian community, which has caused fear and apprehensions among the group. Petition to the United Kingdom A HINDRAF activist carries a poster of Elizabeth II during the march to deliver their petition to the British High Commission On 31 August 2007, the 50th anniversary of Malaysia's independence, P. Waytha Moorthy, a HINDRAF lawyer filed a class action suit against the Government of the United Kingdom at The Royal Courts of Justice in London for US$4 trillion (US$1 million for every Malaysian Indian) for \\"withdrawing after granting independence and leaving us (Indians) unprotected and at the mercy of a majority Malay-Muslim government that has violated our rights as minority Indians\\". as guaranteed in the Federal Constitution when independence was granted. The lawsuit is not only claiming 4 trillion British Pounds as compensation, it is also seeking to strike out Article 153 of the Malaysian Constitution which acknowledges the special position of Malays and the legitimate rights of other races, but is often seen as endorsement of Malay Supremacy and for the court to declare that Malaysia is a secular state and not an Islamic state as declared by former Prime Minister Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad who is partly Indian himself. As the group, which represents mainly working class Indian Malaysians, could not afford the legal fees required, a petition was circulated with 100,000 signatures to be presented to Queen Elizabeth II to appoint a Queen's counsel to argue the case. The purpose of the rally was to hand over a 100,000 signature memorandum to the British High Commission in Kuala Lumpur. HINDRAF organised the rally on Sunday, 25 November 2007 to submit the petition at the British High Commission. Government roadblocks Malaysian police refused to grant a permit for the rally, and set up roadblocks in Klang Valley along roads leading up to the rally to screen motorists entering the city center and identify \\"troublemakers\\". They also advised the public not to participate in the rally, and arrested three leaders of HINDRAF. Many shops around Kuala Lumpur including Suria KLCC were closed on that day in fear of trouble from the rally. One day before the rally, police arrested three HINDRAF lawyers, P. Uthayakumar, P. Waytha Moorthy and V. Ganabatirau for sedition charges. Uthayakumar and Ganabatirau posted bail of 800 Malaysian ringgits each, but Waytha Moorthy refused bail as a sign of protest. The police roadblocks started the week before the rally to create massive traffic jams across the city and the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur. The Malaysian Opposition leader Lim Kit Siang of the DAP pointed out that this high-handed act by the police was unnecessary as it caused major inconvenience to everyone. Rally HINDRAF carrying posters of Mahatma Gandhi and banners during the protest in Kuala LumpurOn the morning of the rally, about twenty thousand people gathered near the Petronas Twin Towers, a symbol of modern Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur, carrying life-size portraits of Elizabeth II and Mahatma Gandhi, to indicate the nonviolent nature of their protest. Five thousand members riot police dispatched to the scene used tear gas and water cannon to disperse the crowds. 136 people were arrested. Al-Jazeera's coverage of the event showed police officers using tear gas to disperse the protesters. A few hundred protesters and three police officers were injured. The protest at the Batu Caves Hindu temple resulted in minor property damages, although the Hindu temple itself was not damaged. HINDRAF later claimed to have faxed the petition to the British High Commission staff. However, as of 28 November 2007, the British Envoy had not yet received any petition from the HINDRAF, though they did say they had received some unspecified information by fax.

The British dragoons scored an initial success, routing the French dragoons and capturing a number of them. The British troopers recklessly galloped after their foes, losing all order. At length, the French reserve squadron charged into the British, followed by the French main body which rallied. With the tables turned, the French dragoons chased the British until the horses of both sides were too exhausted for the battle to continue. The action took place during the Peninsular War, near Maguilla, Spain, a distance of northeast of Llerena. The clash occurred during an indecisive campaign in Extremadura between an Allied corps under Rowland Hill and a French corps led by Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon. In early June 1812, Hill began to advance against d'Erlon's weaker force. At Maguilla, Slade encountered Lallemand's brigade and was beaten. Nevertheless, Hill's advance continued until d'Erlon was reinforced. Hill then withdrew to a strong position that d'Erlon did not dare to attack. Finally, Hill advanced again but did not force a battle. On 22 July 1812 the decisive Allied victory at the Battle of Salamanca occurred farther north. This event finally forced the French to evacuate Andalusia and Extremadura. Background On 6 April 1812, the Siege of Badajoz ended when the Anglo- Portuguese army under the Arthur Wellesley, Earl of Wellington stormed and captured the fortress. The 5,000-man French-Hessian garrison was all killed or captured, while the Allies suffered 4,100 casualties. The capture of Badajoz opened a major invasion route from Portugal into Spain. In 1812, Napoleon became preoccupied with his impending French invasion of Russia. The emperor handed control in Spain to his brother King Joseph Bonaparte and Marshal Jean- Baptiste Jourdan. In May 1812 there were 230,000 French troops in Spain, which Napoleon believed to be an adequate force. Yet half of the total was tied down east of Madrid. Marshal Jean de Dieu Soult's Army of the South had one corps involved in the Siege of C√°diz, a second corps under d'Erlon watching Badajoz, and the remainder occupying Andalusia. To the north, Marshal Auguste de Marmont's Army of Portugal had 52,000 men, but only 35,000 were available after subtracting garrisons. Joseph and Jourdan had 18,000 troops in a central reserve near Madrid. In May 1812, Hill conducted a successful raid which resulted in the Battle of Almaraz and the destruction of a French bridge across the Tagus River. This limited French communication between Marmont and Soult to the bridge at Toledo. Meanwhile, British engineers led by Henry Sturgeon repaired the broken Alc√°ntara Bridge; this permitted the Allies to transfer troops between the northern and southern sectors two weeks faster than the French were able to. Wellington took 48,000 troops to the northern sector to operate against Marmont, leaving 18,000 with Hill to face d'Erlon's corps. Hill had the British 2nd Infantry Division, John Hamilton's Portuguese Division, three Portuguese infantry regiments at Badajoz, and two British and one Portuguese cavalry brigades under Sir William Erskine, 2nd Baronet. Hill commanded about 7,500 British and 11,000 Portuguese. There were also 4,000 Spanish soldiers under Conde de Penne Villemur and Pablo Morillo. D'Erlon led a corps of 12,000 French soldiers, including the infantry divisions of d'Erlon and Augustin Darricau and the cavalry brigades of Lallemand and Andr√© Thomas Perreimond. D'Erlon's own division was camped at Azuaga and Fuente Obejuna while Darricau's division was out of supporting distance to the north at Zalamea de la Serena. Wellington desired that d'Erlon's force be prevented from reinforcing Marmont. The British commander planned to have Hill and Spanish leader Francisco Ballesteros make alternate threats against Soult's army. If the French tried to press Hill, Ballesteros would move against Seville. If the French concentrated to crush Ballesteros, Hill would push forward. In the event, Ballesteros moved too quickly. The Spaniard decided to strike Nicolas Fran√ßois Conroux's 4,500 troops. On 1 June 1812 in the Second Battle of Bornos, Conroux's men were surprised but they rallied and drove off the 8,500 Spanish troops with 1,500 casualties and four guns. French losses were 400‚Äì600 men. Battle When he heard the news of Bornos, Soult sent six infantry battalions and two cavalry regiments to help hunt down Ballesteros. This caused the Spanish general and his soldiers to take refuge under the guns of Gibraltar. Soult wished to smash Ballesteros or capture Tarifa, but when Hill began to advance, the French marshal had to drop his plans. On 7 June, Hill shifted his headquarters to Fuente del Maestre and on 9 June to Zafra. On 11 June, in a reconnaissance in force, Villemur's Spanish cavalry moved from Llerena toward Azuaga while Slade's brigade moved from Llera toward Maguilla. After several hours, Slade's brigade began to bump into French dragoon outposts, which were driven back. Soon afterward, the British dragoons encountered the main body of Lallemand's brigade arrayed in battle order. French dragoons Lallemand's 700-strong brigade consisted of the 17th and 27th Dragoon Regiments. Slade commanded about 700 sabres from the 1st Royal Dragoon and 3rd Dragoon Guards Regiments. The British may have had a slight numerical advantage. Lallemand retreated to the outskirts of Maguilla where he determined to fight. Slade immediately ordered a charge, with the 1st Dragoons in the first line and the 3rd Dragoon Guards in the second. The French dragoons were completely broken and the British took about 100 prisoners. Instead of reforming his brigade, Slade plunged after the fleeing French, \\"each regiment vying with the other which should most distinguish itself\\", as he later proudly reported. The reckless pursuit continued for several miles beyond Maguilla. Suddenly, there was a cry among the British dragoons, \\"Look to your right!\\" Lallemand had held a squadron in reserve, and now this small, but compact force crashed into the disorderly clump of British horsemen. Seeing this sudden turn of events, the main body of Lallemand's dragoons turned on their adversaries and forced them to retreat. It soon became a panicky flight of several miles, despite the appeals of Slade and his officers. The flight ended near Valencia de las Torres, a village about from Maguilla when both sides had exhausted their horses. Slade finally got his survivors into formation and withdrew beyond Llera. The British lost 22 killed, 26 wounded, and 118 captured, with most of the captured being wounded. Lallemand reported losing 51 killed and wounded, including one officer killed and four wounded. Most of the French who were captured at the beginning of the action escaped. Despite his defeat, Slade reported, \\"Nothing could exceed the gallantry displayed by both officers and men on this occasion, in which Colonels Calcraft and Clinton, commanding the two regiments, distinguished themselves, as well as all the other officers present\\". Commentary This was not the only occasion when Wellington's cavalry charged out of control. As examples, historian Charles Oman cited the 20th Light Dragoons at the Battle of Vimeiro, the 23rd Light Dragoons at the Battle of Talavera, and the 13th Light Dragoons at the Battle of Campo Maior. After the battle, a very irritated Wellington wrote to Hill: Aftermath Charles Lallemand The action at Maguilla had no effect on the campaign. D'Erlon retreated before Hill's advance, while sending a message to Soult that his 6,000 men were beset by 30,000 Allies. In fact, d'Erlon neglected to count Darricau's force, which was under his orders. He believed Hill's corps included the 7th Infantry Division, which was actually with Wellington in the north. Soult, who credited Hill with a more realistic 15,000 Anglo-Portuguese and 5,000 Spaniards, sent d'Erlon a 6,000-man infantry division under Pierre Barrois and a 2,200-strong cavalry division under Pierre Beno√Æt Soult. Marshal Soult ordered d'Erlon to force Hill to fight a battle, or at least prevent him from sending reinforcements to Wellington. Barrois left Seville on 16 June and joined d'Erlon's force on 19 June at Bienvenida. With his own division and Darricau's, d'Erlon had about 18,000 troops. When Hill heard about Barrois' reinforcement, he withdrew to the old battlefield of La Albuera. The 19,000 Anglo-Portuguese arrived there and entrenched themselves on 21 June. Hill expected to be attacked because the Allies had intercepted messages from King Joseph demanding that d'Erlon assault his foe. Actually, Soult routinely ignored instructions from Madrid and his lieutenant made excuses for not obeying Joseph's orders. From 21 June to 2 July the two opposing forces stood motionless, facing each other. The Anglo-Portuguese soldiers had to endure the stench of the hundreds of imperfectly buried corpses from the Battle of Albuera the previous year. On 1 July, Pierre Soult directed a cavalry reconnaissance of the Allied position, with Louis Ernest Joseph Sparre's brigade on the right, Gilbert Julian Vinot's brigade in the center and Lallemand's brigade on the left. Lallemand routed Villemur's cavalry from Santa Marta with substantial losses. The other two brigades skirmished with the Allied cavalry screen. D'Erlon reported to Soult that Hill had 25,000 infantry, 3,000 cavalry, and plenty of artillery; he believed it would be foolhardy to attack. Hill broke the deadlock by advancing on 2 July. He expected a battle near Fuente del Maestre on 4 July, but the French withdrew when their left flank was threatened. On 7 July, d'Erlon abandoned a strong position at Valencia de las Torres when Hill again turned his left flank. At this point, d'Erlon was at Azuaga and both armies were in the same positions they were on 19 June, before Hill withdrew to La Albuera. The French commander sent Darricau to Zalamea with the cavalry of Vinot and Sparre. On 27 July, Vinot's cavalry raided M√©rida from which they carried off food supplies. Curiously, both Hill and d'Erlon were satisfied that they had contained the enemy. Soult received news of Marmont's decisive defeat at the Battle of Salamanca on 12 August. The evacuation of Andalusia soon began. Hill found d'Erlon's lines empty on 26 August. Hill did not pursue because Wellington summoned him to join the main Allied army. D'Erlon joined Soult's main column at C√≥rdoba on 30 August. Soon, the south of Spain was free from French occupation.

GPR55, along with GPR119 and GPR18, have been implicated as novel cannabinoid receptors.  History  GPR55 was identified and cloned for the first time in 1999. Later it was identified by an in silico screen as a putative cannabinoid receptor because of a similar amino acid sequence in the binding region. Research groups from Glaxo Smith Kline and Astra Zeneca characterized the receptor extensively because it was hoped to be responsible for the blood pressure lowering properties of cannabinoids. GPR55 is indeed activated by endogenous and exogenous cannabinoids such as plant and synthetic cannabinoids but GPR-55 knockout mice generated by a research group from Glaxo Smith Kline showed no altered blood pressure regulation after administration of the cannabidiol- derivative abnormal cannabidiol.  Signal cascade  GPR55 is coupled to the G-protein G13 and activation of the receptor leads to stimulation of rhoA, cdc42 and rac1.  Pharmacology  GPR55 is activated by the plant cannabinoids Œî9-THC and the endocannabinoids anandamide, 2-AG and noladin ether in the low nanomolar range. Exocannabinoids such as the synthetic cannabinoid CP-55940 are also able to activate the receptor while the structurally unrelated cannabinoid mimic WIN 55,212-2 fails to activate the receptor. Recent research suggests that lysophosphatidylinositol and its 2-arachidonoyl derivative, 2-arachidonoyl lysophosphatidylinositol (2-ALPI), may be the endogenous ligands for GPR55 and the receptor appears likely to be a possible target for treatment of inflammation and pain as with the other cannabinoid receptors. This profile as a distinct non-CB1/CB2 receptor which responds to a variety of both endogenous and exogenous cannabinoid ligands has led some groups to suggest GPR55 should be categorised as the CB3 receptor, and this re-classification may follow in time. However this is complicated by the fact that another possible CB3 receptor has been discovered in the hippocampus, although its gene has not yet been cloned, suggesting that there may be at least four cannabinoid receptors which will eventually be characterised. Evidence accumulated during the last few years suggests that GPR55 plays a relevant role in cancer and opens the possibility of considering this orphan receptor as a new therapeutic target and potential biomarker in oncology. Ligands ;Agonists Ligands found to bind to GPR55 as agonists include: * Lysophosphatidylinositol * 2-Arachidonoyl lysophosphatidylinositol * Abnormal cannabidiol (Abn-CBD) * AM-251 (also CB1 antagonist) * CP 55,940 * GSK-319,197 * GSK-494,581 - also glycine transporter 1 inhibitor * GSK-522,373 * O-1602 * Œî9-Tetrahydrocannabinol * 2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) * Noladin ether * Oleoylethanolamide * Palmitoylethanolamide * ML-184, ML-185 and ML-186 ;Antagonists * CID-16020046 - inverse agonist at GPR55 * O-1918 * ML-191, ML-192 and ML-193 * PSB-SB-487 and PSB-SB-1203 * Cannabidiol  Physiological function  The physiological role of GPR55 is unclear.

GPR64 is a member of the adhesion GPCR family. Adhesion GPCRs are characterized by an extended extracellular region often possessing N-terminal protein modules that is linked to a TM7 region via a domain known as the GPCR- Autoproteolysis INducing (GAIN) domain. The adhesion GPCR, GPR64, is an orphan receptor characterized by a long N-terminus with that has been suggested to be highly glycosylated. GPR64's N-terminus has been reported to be cleaved at the GPS domain to allow for trafficking to the plasma membrane. After cleavage the N-terminus is believed to remain non-covalently associated with the 7TM. GPR64 expression has been mostly reported in the male reproductive organs, but more recently has been shown to be expressed in the parathyroid glands and central nervous system. GPR64 is mainly expressed in human and mouse epididymis as well as human prostate and parathyroid. GPR64, together with F-actin scaffold, locates at the nonciliated principal cells of the proximal male excurrent duct epithelia, where reabsorption of testicular fluid and concentration of sperm takes place.  Function  Targeting of Gpr64 in mice causes reduced fertility or infertility in males; but the reproductive capacity was unaffected in females. Unchanged hormone expression in knockout males indicates that the receptor functions immediately in the male genital tract. Lack of Gpr64 expression causes sperm stasis and duct obstruction due to abnormal fluid reabsorption. In addition, expression of GPR64 has been found in fibroblast-like synovial cells obtained from osteoarthritis but not from rheumatoid arthritis.  Clinical significance  GPR64 is significantly overexpressed in the Wnt signaling-dependent subgroup of medulloblastoma, as well as in ewing sarcomas and carcinomas derived from prostate, kidney or lung. Richter et al. demonstrated that GPR64 promotes tumor invasion and metastasis through placental growth factor and MMP1. Upregulation and activation of GPR64 are associated with primary hyperparathyroidism and hypersecretion of parathyroid hormone.

CYSLTR1, by binding these cysteinyl LTs (CysLTs; viz, LTC4, LTD4, and to a much lesser extent, LTE4) contributes to mediating various allergic and hypersensitivity reactions in humans as well as models of the reactions in other animals.  Gene  The human gene maps to the X chromosome at position Xq13-Xq21, contains three exons with the entire open reading frame located in exon 3, and codes for a protein composed of 337 amino acids. The CYSLTR1 gene promoter region is distanced from 665 to 30 bp upstream of its transcription start site.  Expression  CYSLTR1 mRNA is expressed in lung smooth muscle, lung macrophages, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, neutrophils, platelets, T cells, B lymphocytes, pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells (CD34+), mast cells, pancreas, small intestine, prostate, interstitial cells of the nasal mucosa, airway smooth muscle cells, bronchial fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells.  Function  CysLTR1 is a G protein‚Äìcoupled receptor that links to and when bound to its CysLT ligands activates the Gq alpha subunit and/or Ga subunit of its coupled G protein, depending on the cell type. Acting through these G proteins and their subunits, ligand-bound CysLTR1 activates a series of pathways that lead to cell function (see Gq alpha subunit#function and Ga subunit#function for details); the order of potency of the in stimulating CysLTR1 is LTD4>LTC4>LTE4 with LTE4 probably lacking sufficient potency to have much activity that operates through CysLTR1 in vivo. CysLTR1 activation by LTC4 and/or LTD4 in animal models and humans causes: airway bronchoconstriction and hyper-responsiveness to bronchoconstriction agents such as histamine; increased vascular permeability, edema, influx of eosinophils and neutrophils, smooth muscle proliferation, collagen deposition, and fibrosis in various tissue sites; and mucin secretion by goblet cells, goblet cell metaplasia, and epithelial cell hypertrophy in the membranes of the respiratory system. Animal model and human tissue (preclinical studies) implicate CysLTR1 antagonists as having protective/reparative effects in models of brain injury (trauma-, ischemia-, and cold-induced), multiple sclerosis, auto-immune encephalomyelitis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. CysLTR1 activation is also associated in animal models with decreasing the Blood-brain barrier (i.e. increasing the permeability of brain capillaries to elements of the blood's soluble elements) as well as promoting the movement of leukocytes for the blood to brain tissues; these effects may increase the development and frequency of Epileptic seizure as well as the entry of leucocyte-borne viruses such as HIV-1 into brain tissue. Increased expression of CysLTR1 has been observed in Transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder, neuroblastoma and other brain cancers, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer (CRC); indeed, CysLTR1 tumor expression is associated with poor survival prognoses in breast cancer and CRC patients, and drug inhibitors of CysLTR1 block the in vivo and in vivo (animal model) growth of CRC cells and tumors, respectively. The pro-cancer effects of CysLTR1 in CRC appear due to its ability to up-regulate pathways that increase in CRC cell proliferation and survival. Other cysLT receptors include cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2 (i.e. CysLTR2) and GPR99 (also termed the oxoglutarate receptor and, sometimes, CysLTR3). The order of potency of the in stimulating CysLTR2 is LTD4=LTC4>LTE4 with LTE4 probably lacking sufficient potency to have much activity that operates through CysLTR2 in vivo. GPR99 appears to be an important receptor for CysLTs, particularly for LTE4. The CysLTs show relative potencies of LTE4>LTC4>LTD4 in stimulating GPR99-bearing cells with GPR99-deficient mice exhibiting a dose-dependent loss of vascular permeability responses in skin to LTE4 but not to LTC4 or LTD4. This and other data suggest that GPR99 is an important receptor for the in vivo actions of LTE4 but not LTD4 or LTC4 The GPR17 receptor, also termed the uracil nucleotide/cysteinyl leukotriene receptor, was initially defined as a receptor for LTC4, LTD4, and uracil nucleotides. However, more recent studies from different laboratories could not confirm these results; they found that GPR17-bearing cells did not respond to these CysLTs or nucleotides but did find that cells expressing both CysLTR1 and GPR17 receptors exhibited a marked reduction in binding LTC4 and that mice lacking GPR17 were hyper-responsive to igE-induced passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. GPR17 therefore appears to inhibit CysLTR1, at least in these model systems. In striking contrast to these studies, studies concentration on neural tissues continue to find that Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells express GPR17 and respond through this receptor to LTC4, LTD4, and certain purines (see GPR17#Function). The Purinergic receptor, P2Y12, while not directly binding or responding to CysLTs, appears to be activated as a consequence of activating CysLT1: blockage of P2Y12 activation either by receptor depletion or pharmacological methods inhibits many of the CysLTR1-dependent actions of CysLTs in various cell types in vitro as well as in an animal model of allergic disease.  Ligands  The major CysLTs viz., LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4, are metabolites of arachidonic acid made by the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme, ALOX5, mainly by cells involved in regulating inflammation, allergy, and other immune responses such as neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, macrophages, mast cells, dendritic cells, and B-lymphocytes. ALOX5 metabolizes arachidonic acid to the 5,6-epoxide precursor, LTA4, which is then acted on by LTC4 synthase which attaches the Œ≥-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine tripeptide (i.e. glutathione) to carbon 6 of the intermediate thereby forming LTC4 synthase. LTC4 then exits its cells of origin through the MRP1 transporter (ABCC1) and is rapidly converted to LTD4 and then to LTE4) by cell surface-attached gamma- glutamyltransferase and dipeptidase peptidase enzymes by the sequential removal of the Œ≥-glutamyl and then glycine residues.  Gene polymorphism  927T/C (nucleotide thymine replaces cytosine at position 97 of the CysLTR1 gene) gene polymorphism in the coding region of CysLTR1 has been shown to be predictive of the severity of atopy (i.e. a predisposition toward developing certain allergic hypersensitivity reactions), but not associated with asthma, in a population of 341 Caucasians in afflicted sib-pair families from the Southampton area in the United Kingdom. This atopy severity was most apparent in female siblings but the incidence of this polymorphism is extremely low and the functionality of the 927T/C gene and its product protein are as yet unknown. The population of the small remote far South Atlantic Ocean island of Tristan da Cunha (266 permanent, genetically isolated residents) suffers a high prevalence of atopy and asthma. The CysLTR1 gene product variant, 300G/S (i.e. amino acid glycine replaces serine at the 300 position of the CysLTR1 protein), has been shown to be significantly associated with atopy in this population. The CysLTR1 300S variant exhibited significant increased sensitivity to LTD4 and LTC4 suggesting that this hypersensitivity underlies its association with atopy.  Clinical significance  In spite of the other receptors cited as being responsive to CysLTs, CysLTR1 appears to be critical in mediating many of the pathological responses to CysLTs in humans. Montelukast, Zafirlukast, and Pranlukast are selective receptor antagonists for the CysLTR1 but not CysLTR2. These drugs are in use and/or shown to be effective as prophylaxis and chronic treatments for allergic and non-allergic diseases such as: allergen-induced asthma and rhinitis; nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drug-induced asthma and rhinitis (see Aspirin-induced asthma); exercise- and cold-air induced asthma (see Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction); and childhood sleep apnea due to adenotonsillar hypertrophy (see Acquired non-inflammatory myopathy#Diet and Trauma Induced Myopathy). However, responses to these drugs vary greatly with the drugs showing fairly high rates of poor responses and ~20% of patients reporting no change in symptoms after treatment with these agents. It seems possible that the responses of CysLTR2, GPR99, or other receptors to CysLT's may be contributing to these diseases.

It is an adaptation of the 1978 Broadway musical of the same name, and stars Dolly Parton, Burt Reynolds, Jim Nabors, Charles Durning, Dom DeLuise, Noah Beery Jr., Robert Mandan, Lois Nettleton, Theresa Merritt, Barry Corbin, Mary Jo Catlett and Mary Louise Wilson. Durning was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as the Texas governor. Golden Globe Award nominations went to the film for Best Motion Picture (Comedy or Musical) and Parton for Best Actress in a Motion Picture (Comedy or Musical). It was the fourth highest-grossing live-action musical film of the 1980s, and the top grossing of 1982. Plot Ed Earl Dodd, the sheriff of Gilbert, Texas, has a relationship of long standing with Miss Mona Stangley, who runs a brothel called the \\"Chicken Ranch\\" outside of town. Illegal or not, Earl does not interfere with her business, which has been a fixture in the town for as long as either can remember. Lovers on the side, occasionally interrupted by Deputy Fred, the sheriff and madam have a pleasant arrangement. Not everyone in town approves of her, but Miss Mona is a public-minded citizen who regularly donates to charity, decent and law-abiding in every respect but her line of work. A big-city television personality from New Jersey, do-gooder Melvin P. Thorpe, is about to do a segment about the town, so the sheriff travels there to introduce himself to Thorpe, who greets him warmly. He is shocked by Thorpe's live telecast, in which Thorpe reveals to a huge audience his discovery that \\"Texas has a whorehouse in it.\\" The Chicken Ranch is an institution, where the winning team from the football game between state rivals the University of Texas Longhorns and the Texas A&M; Aggies traditionally is brought to \\"celebrate\\" its victory. The negative publicity puts a spotlight on the place, so Ed Earl gets Miss Mona's word that she will shut the doors until the attention goes away. She shuts it down to regular customers but elects to let the football players have their party, at which point Thorpe and his TV cameras sneak onto the property and ambush them all. Earl compounds the problem by insulting and threatening Thorpe in the town public square, all also caught on TV. A quarrel and bitter breakup between the sheriff and Miss Mona ensues, punctuated by him calling her \\"a whore.\\" The Governor of Texas, who cannot make a decision on a single issue until he first sees what voters say in the polls, listens to Earl's appeals to keep the Chicken Ranch open, but when the polls say no he orders Ed Earl to close down the Chicken Ranch. The working girls leave the Chicken Ranch for good. Miss Mona is disconsolate, at least until finding out the effort made by the sheriff on her behalf. As Miss Mona is departing the whorehouse for the last time, Earl stops her and proposes to her. She turns him down, knowing that his dream is to run for state legislature and that having a wife who worked in prostitution would hurt his chances. He again insists that he wants to marry her and that he does not care about what people will think or say. Deputy Fred, in a voiceover, states that Earl and Miss Mona married and that Earl successfully ran for the legislature. Deputy Fred states that he succeeded Earl as Sheriff.

King recommended Shirley MacLaine, Dyan Cannon, Cari Glynn and Jill Clayburgh as the possibles to star but was told they were not a sufficient box office draw. When Dolly Parton was cast King suggested Willie Nelson as a co-star and Universal executives met with him but at the end Burt Reynolds was cast. Reynolds was paid $3.5 million and Parton $1.5 million. Reynolds wanted script changes and wanted to sing. Universal became nervous about giving the film to first-time directors and ended up replacing Masterton and Tune with Colin Higgins. Reynolds later said Parton \\"had two directors fired before we started ‚Äì they were gone. Because I'd made so many movies and she hadn't, everyone thought it was me. Whether she was right or wrong in those decisions, it was amazing to me that she could do it.\\" Higgins prepared for directing it by watching old George Cukor films and Dr. Pepper commercials (\\"They have a lot of wonderful movement\\", said Higgins.) Reynolds said he suggested to Higgins that Charles Durning be cast. \\"Colin is very smart, very commercial. They wanted Mickey Rooney, so I manipulated him a little. I told Colin, 'Mickey Rooney is a wonderful actor, but everyone knows that. You won't get any credit. Charles Durning can sing and dance and no one knows it, so you'll get all the credit.' \\" Adaptation The book of the play was restructured to make it a vehicle for Parton and Reynolds. The plot is basically the same as that of the stage production, with one significant difference. In the original, Ed Earl and Miss Mona had a one-night stand 15 years earlier, but in the film, they maintain an ongoing affair. The relationship in the film brings about not only the accusatory scene, when the sheriff--disappointed that Mona has broken her promise to close the Chicken Ranch down long enough for things to cool off-- calls her a whore, but also the happy ending, when he proposes marriage to Mona, even though that might endanger his chances to be elected as a state legislator; the epilogue comments state that he is elected anyway. Shooting Parton described her experience making the movie as 'a nightmare.'Dolly on Dolly: Interviews and Encounters with Dolly Parton. ed. Randy L. Schmidt For his part, Reynolds described Parton as 'very self deprecating ‚Äì in public.' Music Much of Carol Hall's original Broadway score was performed in the movie version. Omitted were \\"Good Old Girl\\", \\"The Bus From Amarillo\\", \\"24 Hours of Lovin\\", \\"No Lies\\" and \\"Doatsie Mae\\". Two additional Parton compositions appear in the film: \\"Sneakin' Around\\", performed as a duet with Parton and Reynolds, and a two-stanza version of Parton's 1973 composition \\"I Will Always Love You\\". The film version of \\"I Will Always Love You\\"‚Äîthe original recording has been a U.S. country chart- topper for Parton in the spring of 1974‚Äîwas released as a single in July 1982, and again reached number one on the U.S. country singles chart. It was also a mid-level hit on Billboard pop and adult contemporary charts. An altered version of Hall's \\"Hard Candy Christmas\\", in which Parton sings both the chorus and the verses of the song (as opposed to the film version, which is partially sung by some of the other female cast members), was also released as a single, reaching the top ten on the country singles chart in late 1982. Parton wrote several new songs which were filmed but ultimately not used, including \\"A Gamble Either Way\\" and \\"Where Stallions Run\\". The latter was restored for the ABC network television broadcast of the film, as the film was too short for its time slot after the censors finished their broadcast edits and additional material was needed. \\"A Gamble Either Way\\" replaced \\"Girl You're a Woman\\" from the Broadway score and was sung by Parton after Miss Mona interviewed \\"Shy\\" (Andrea Pike) for a job at the Chicken Ranch. The characters of Shy and Angel from the Broadway show were reduced in the film. Their footage was eventually edited out. \\"Down At The Chicken Ranch\\" was written for the trailer. Parton recorded two of the deleted songs, \\"A Gamble Either Way\\", and \\"A Cowboy's Ways\\" (a reworking of \\"Where Stallions Run\\"), and included them on her 1983 album Burlap & Satin. Release Marketing The film presented some difficulties for Universal, particularly with advertising. In 1982, the word \\"whorehouse\\" was considered obscene in parts of the United States, resulting in the film being renamed The Best Little Cathouse in Texas in some print ads, while television ads were either banned outright in some areas, or the offending word was censored; on WXYZ-TV in Detroit, the announcer on the station's \\"Now Showing\\" segment merely clicked his tongue to eliminate the offending word: \\"The Best Little [click, click] in Texas!\\" In Canada, the title was generally left alone in print, but televised trailers used a bleep censor over the word. During interviews, Parton sometimes referred to the film as The Best Little Chicken House in Texas. Box office The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas opened in 1,400 theaters on July 23, 1982 and earned $11,874,268 in its opening weekend, ranking number one in the United States box office, dethroning E.T. The Extra Terrestrials six-week run at the top of the box office. It was the biggest weekend for a musical film ever. The film grossed $69,701,637 domestically. Critical reception The film received mixed reviews from critics. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 50% rating based on 10 reviews. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two out of four stars, stating, \\"If they ever give Dolly her freedom and stop packaging her so antiseptically, she could be terrific. But Dolly and Burt and Whorehouse never get beyond the concept stage in this movie.\\" Cultural influence The film and the original Broadway musical it was based on were spoofed in the 1982 pornographic film Memphis Cathouse Blues, which starred Annette Haven in the Dolly Parton role of the madam and Mike Horner in the Burt Reynolds role as the sheriff. Porn star Kay Parker, who played one of the prostitutes in the film, had an uncredited bit role in The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas. Legacy The house used in the film is located at Universal Studios in Hollywood and can be viewed as part of the backlot tram tour. The inspiration for the set came from a real ranch house located outside Austin, Texas, which is featured in scenes from the movie.

Commissioner, 628 F.2d 467 (5th Cir. 1980) is a United States federal income tax case before the Fifth Circuit. It dealt with the issue of whether clothes purchased solely for use at work could be treated as a business expense deduction on a taxpayer's return. HELD: *An \\"objective\\" (reasonableness) test is used to determine whether clothes worn at work were adaptable to general usage and therefore not deductible. **The clothes in this case were adaptable to general usage, regardless of taxpayer's personal preference against wearing the clothes outside of work.  Facts  Sandra J. Pevsner was a manager of the Yves Saint Laurent (YSL) boutique in Dallas, Texas. She was required by her employer to wear YSL clothing while at work and at work-related fashion shows and luncheons. She spent $1,381.91 on YSL clothing (at a discount) to meet these requirements, and subsequently deducted that amount from her 1975 federal income tax return as an ordinary and necessary business expense.  Tax Court Ruling  In the tax court, the Commissioner argued that the clothing was \\"suitable for general or personal wear\\"Pevsner, 628 F.2d at 470. and should therefore not be deductible. Pevsner argued (and the commissioner stipulated) that she has never worn the clothing outside of work and considers the clothing \\"too expensive for her simple everyday lifestyle.\\"Pevsner, 628 F.2d at 469. The tax court ruled that the test should be subjective to the taxpayer, and allowed the deduction on the grounds that \\"wearing of YSL apparel outside work would be inconsistent with ‚Ä¶ (taxpayer's) lifestyle.\\"  Issue  Is the cost of the YSL clothing purchased by Pevsner deductible as an ordinary and necessary business expense?  Appellate Court Holding  The clothing is not deductible as a business expense.  Reasoning  The general rule is that the cost of clothing is deductible as a business expense only if: (1) the clothing is of a type specifically required as a condition of employment, (2) it is not adaptable to general usage as ordinary clothing, and (3) it is not so worn.Pevsner, 628 F.2d at 469 (citing Donnelly v. Commissioner, 262 F.2d 411, 412 (2d Cir. 1959)). The court held that the question of whether clothing is adaptable to general usage is to be approached with an objective test, rejecting the subjective test employed by the tax court below. The court justified an objective test by citing cases from other circuits.Specifically, the court cited Stiner v. United States, 524 F.2d 640, 641 (10th Cir. 1975) and Donnelly v. Commissioner at 412. The court also endorsed an objective test on policy grounds. First, the court reasoned that an objective test is more easily administered. That is, it would be impractical to determine what combination of price and style would push clothes out of the personal category and into a work-only status. Moreover, a subjective test would involve an examination of a taxpayer's personal taste and fashion sense, providing no guidelines for a court to follow in its determination of what is deductible. Second, under a utilitarian theory, fairness among the greatest number of taxpayers is best served with an objective test. Under a subjective test \\"two similarly situated YSL boutique managers with identical wardrobes would be subject to disparate tax consequences depending upon the particular manager's lifestyle and 'socio- economic level.'\\"Pevsner, 628 F.2d at 471. The court wished to avoid such a result.  Tax Code  The applicable sections of the Tax Code are ¬ß¬ß 162 and 262., . These sections must always be looked at together, because ¬ß 162 generally allows a deduction for ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in a trade or business while ¬ß 262 disallows deductions for all personal, living, or family expenses. Specifically, ¬ß 162(a) states that \\"there shall be allowed as a deduction all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business‚Ä¶.\\"(a). Then, it lists three things that are ordinary and necessary expenses, none of which expressly or implicitly would include the work clothes at issue here. Thus, ¬ß 162 is not very helpful for Mrs. Pevsner. Even less helpful, is ¬ß 262. This section holds that \\"[e]xcept as otherwise expressly provided in this chapter, no deduction shall be allowed for personal, living, or family expenses.\\"(a). Clothing being inherently personal, it seems that the Tax Code cuts against the argument of allowing a deduction here. Although, perhaps if the clothing were made impersonal, via a gaudy nametag or store logo attached, a deduction would be allowed. Unfortunately, at a high-end clothing boutique neither of those is likely.  Policy  Admittedly, policy arguments could be made on both sides of this case. However, since the court ruled in favor of disallowing the deduction, this section will focus on the policy behind that decision. #Slippery slope. Allowing a deduction here would be leading down a slippery slope. Once these clothes, which arguably may be used in everyday life, are deductible, then what next? Makeup? Deodorant? Perfumes or cologne? Socks? Underwear? All of these are things that a taxpayer could reasonably say are only for work and that are inconsistent with everyday personal tastes. Clearly, the line must be drawn somewhere. #Easy Administration. The court hinted at this argument but did not elaborate much. Millions of taxpayers have to wear certain clothes to work that may not be worn much otherwise. But, who would administer and oversee that there are no abuses if deductions are allowed willy-nilly? Soon enough, every taxpayer would be claiming ties, shirts, dress pants, and all sorts of clothing as work-only while easily being able to double-dip and wear them outside of work. Enforcement of such a system would be a logistical nightmare. It is much easier to administer a system where the general rule is a disallowance and then let taxpayers prove otherwise. #Personal Choice. The taxpayer here is choosing to work at the clothing boutique. On the one hand, we want people to be employed and we don't want to make that harder by forcing certain persons to make expenditures that prevent employment. On the other hand, Mrs. Pevsner chose to work at an upscale clothing boutique. She reasonably knew that the dress requisite for work would likely be something that she may not wear otherwise. But, she did receive some breaks. First, she was allowed to wear the clothing outside of work. Then, she was allowed to purchase the clothing at a discount. Finally, she got a lot of use out of the clothing. She wore it to work, to independent meetings, and to fashion shows. This demonstrates the versatility and adaptability of the clothing.  Significance  This decision explains why, for example, a young lawyer who buys a new suit exclusively for work and never dresses in a suit outside of work would not be able to deduct the suit on his or her tax return. Courts will find that the suit is generally suitable for ordinary wear, regardless of the particular lawyer's personal dress habits outside of work. Academic Commentary Could question the result‚Äìonce it is clearly a work requirement, why not allow the deduction? Allowing it seems to fit in with the ruling in Benaglia (personal benefit but lack of personal choice). Commissioner's goal was probably to avoid the need to make case-by- case determination based on presence or absence of \\"convenience of the employer\\" argument.

The act eliminated the previous requirements under US law that a second term of copyright protection is contingent on a renewal registration with the U.S. Copyright Office.Registration of Claims to Copyright-Renewals: Final Rule, U.S. Copyright Office, 72 Fed. Reg. 61801-61806 (Nov. 1, 2007) It amended the Copyright Act of 1976. Renewal system prior to and following the 1992 amendment Under the 1909 copyright, works copyrighted in the United States before January 1, 1978, were subject to a renewal system in which the term of copyright was divided into two consecutive terms. Strict time limits were imposed on renewal registration to secure the second term and extending copyright to the maximum length. Current copyright law is contained in title 17 of the United States Code. The Copyright Act of 1976 came into effect on January 1, 1978, and retained the renewal system for works that were copyrighted before 1978 and were still in their first terms on January 1, 1978. The statute, for these works, provides for a first term of copyright protection lasting 28 years, with the possibility for a second term of 47 years. This earlier system is also referred to as an \\"opt-in\\" system since authors would have to take the necessary steps required to claim the second term.Sprigman, Christopher. \\"9th Circuit Rejects Constitutional Challenge to Copyright Laws in Kahle v. Gonzales.\\" Stanford Center for Internet and Society The 1992 amending legislation secures this second term for works copyrighted between January 1, 1964, and December 31, 1977, without a renewal registration requirement. This system has been referred to as an \\"opt-out\\" system because it provides for copyright protection even if it is not requested by the author of a work. However, if a copyright originally secured before January 1, 1964, was not renewed at the proper time, protection would have expired at the end of the 28th calendar year of the copyright. Under the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-298) twenty more years were added to the second term for works copyrighted between January 1, 1964, and December 31, 1977. This made the total duration of copyright for these works 95 years. Benefits of filing copyright renewal application The copyright office does not issue a renewal certificate, though renewal is secured automatically, unless the renewal application and fees are received and registered at the Copyright Office. The Copyright Office outlines the following benefits of filing a Copyright Renewal Application: # The renewal copyright is established in the name of the renewal claimant on the effective day of renewal registration. If the renewal registration was not made in the 28th year, the renewal copyright is secured by the party entitled to claim renewal by December 31 of the 28th year. # The Copyright Office issues a renewal certificate which acts as prima facie evidence of the validity of copyright during renewal and extended term. # The right to use derivative works in the extended period might be impacted by renewal registration. However, in cases where no renewal registration was made, important benefits such as statutory damages and attorneys fees can still be secured by filing a renewal registration anytime during the renewal term. Eligibility to claim renewal The law specifies the persons who are eligible to claim renewal copyright. Apart from anonymous works, the following are eligible to claim renewal: # The author, if living # The widow or widower of the author or the children or both, if the author is dead. # If there are no immediate family members, and there is a will, then the author's executors can claim renewal. # If there is no immediate family or will, the next of kin may claim the copyright. A copyright proprietor or owner may claim renewal in only the following cases: # Posthumous work # Periodical, cyclopedic, or composite work # Work copyrighted by a corporate entity # Work made for hire. Music industry implications Many critics viewed the Copyright Renewal Act of 1992, which was backed by the Recording Industry Association of America, as an attempt to prevent many songs from falling into the public domain because of procedural difficulties and mismanagement.Holland, Bill (1992). \\"C'right Renewal Act Is Law; Home-Taping Act Still Pending.\\" Billboard July 11, 1992. In the past several authors had lost considerable royalties on their works because they were not aware of the renewal procedure; this act aimed to prohibit such instances from occurring.\\"Bush Likely to OK Bill That Would Renew All Pre-1978 Copyrights.\\" Billboard 20 June 1992. A Billboard magazine article mentions the complaint of Jacqueline Byrd, widow of Robert Byrd, the songwriter who wrote ‚ÄúLittle Bitty Pretty One‚Äù, a 1957 hit. Byrd was informed by the Copyright Office that they had not received the renewal application for the song, and hence they would be ending royalty payments. Had the song been renewed, Byrd and her four children would‚Äôve received payments till 2037. This incident was used to convince lawmakers about the need for such an amendment. Reaction against the 1992 amendment In 2007, four plaintiffs‚Äîthe Internet Archive and its founder Brewster Kahle, and Prelinger Archives and its founder Rick Prelinger‚Äîfiled the case Kahle v. Ashcroft in the Northern District of California, seeking a declaration that the Copyright Renewal Act was unconstitutional. The Internet Archive is a partner in the Million Book Project, a venture that aimed to scan over a million books to make it available to the public on the Internet.Lee, Tim (2007). \\"Appeals Court Rejects Challenge to \\"opt-out\\" Copyright.\\" Ars Technica The plaintiffs argued that there are several cases where it is impossible to locate the authors. These orphan works could be used to contribute to projects that utilized public domain works. However, the 1992 amendment, by removing the renewal requirement of these works, prevented such works from falling into the public domain. The district court dismissed the case. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal on January 22, 2007, saying that they had essentially made the same arguments as made in the Eldred case, which had already been rejected by the United States Supreme Court.Auchard, Eric (2007). ‚ÄúU.S. Court upholds copyright law on ‚Äúorphan works‚Äù Reuters Other Titles of the Copyright Amendments Act of 1992  National Film Preservation Act of 1992  The National Film Preservation Act of 1992 was included in the Copyright Amendments Act of 1992 as Title II. This act replaced the previous National Film Preservation Act of 1988 and reauthorized the National Film Registry and the National Film Preservation Board of the Library of Congress until 1996 (four years after the date of enactment). It also included instructions for the Librarian of Congress.  Title III: Other Copyright Provisions  Title III of the Copyright Renewal Act of 1992 repealed the previous requirement that the Register of Copyrights report to Congress every five years regarding library and archives photocopying of copyrighted materials.

A native of Staten Island, New York, Arnold moved at an early age to Somerville, New Jersey where she began her childhood friendship with Mabel Reed, a companionship that later matured into a life partnership. Arnold studied business at Drexel Institute, Philadelphia, and agriculture at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. As young women, Arnold and Reed devoted five years (1901‚Äì1906) to farming a fifty-five acre plot.Carter, Patricia.\\"'Completely discouraged': Women teachers' resistance in the Bureau of Indian Affairs schools, 1900-1910.\\" Frontiers (15.3) They next gained experience as urban organizers in New York City.

When Arnold and Reed accepted positions as so-called field matrons on the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation in the Klamath River Valley of Northern California, they were charged to exert a \\"civilizing influence\\" upon the fewer than eight hundred members of the Karok nation, a vagueness they were to exploit to their own benefit and that of the Karok. Arnold and Reed lacked the social and racial prejudices of the era. Although the Bureau of Indian Affairs expected them to enforce white cultural values, they instead accepted Karok practices and established a close working friendship with Essie, a native woman with three husbands. They were eager, Arnold said, not to be \\"ladies‚Äîthe kind who have Sunday schools, and never say a bad word, and rustle around in a lot of silk petticoats\\".Faderman, Lillian.

In the decades following their breakthrough experience of independent living and community education among the Karok, Arnold and Reed further developed their skills as organizers and activists in cooperative housing, credit unions, adult education, rural development, and American Indian rights. Arnold worked in Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, Maine, New York, and Pennsylvania. In Reserve Mines, Nova Scotia, Arnold and Reed helped the mining community establish cooperative housing. Arnold conferred with Antigonish Movement elders Moses Coady and Father Jimmy and she and Reed lived among the miners.

Kyte's great-uncle and aunt were among the residents, struggling for freedom from the Dominion Coal Company in Reserve Mines.

DP2 has also been designated as CD294 (cluster of differentiation 294). It is a member of the class of prostaglandin receptors which bind with and respond to various prostaglandins. DP2 along with Prostaglandin DP1 receptor are receptors for prostaglandin D2 (PGD2). Activation of DP2 by PGD2 or other cognate receptor ligands has been associated with certain physiological and pathological responses, particularly those associated with allergy and inflammation, in animal models and certain human diseases. Gene The PTGDR2 gene is located on human chromosome 11 at position q12.2 (i.e. 11q12.2). It consists of two introns and three exons and codes for a G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) composed of 472 amino acids. DP2, is related to members of the chemotactic factor class of GPCRs, sharing an amino acid sequence identity of 29% with the C5a receptor, Formyl peptide receptor 1, and Formyl peptide receptor 2 receptors. DP2 has little or no such amino acid sequence relationship to the eight other Prostanoid receptors (see Eicosanoid receptor#Prostenoid receptors). Expression DP2 was found to stimulate the directed movement or chemotaxis of human T-helper type 2 cells (see T helper cell#Th1/Th2 Model for helper T cells) by binding to a receptor initially termed GPR44 and thereafter CRTH2 (for Chemoattractant Receptor- homologous molecule expressed on T-Helper type 2 cells). In addition to these T helper cells, DP2 messenger RNA is also expressed by human basophils, eosinophils, a subpopulation of cytotoxic T cells (i.e. CD8+ T cells), thalamus, ovary, and spleen, and, in the central nervous system, by the frontal cortex, pons, hippocampus, and at lower levels, hypothalamus and caudate nucleus/putamen. These transcripts are also detected in fetal liver and thymus. Ligands Activating ligands The following standard prostaglandins have the following relative affinities and potencies in binding to and activating DP2: PGD2>>PGF2alpha=PGE2>PGI2=thromboxane A2. The cyclopentenone prostaglandins, PGJ2, Œî12-PGJ2, and 15-d-Œî12,14-PGJ2 are spontaneously formed or protein-facilitated derivatives of PGD2 that are generated in vitro as well as in vivo; these derivatives have binding affinities and activating potencies on DP2 that are similar to PGD2. Studies suggest that at least some if not most or all of the cytotoxic effects of cylopenenone prostaglandin derivatives of PGD2 act independently of DP2. Certain metabolites and derivatives of PGD2 viz., 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGD2 and 15(S)-15-methyl-PGD2, are ~10-fold less active than PGD2 while the drug indomethacin is weak in activating DP2. Inhibiting ligands The following compounds are selective receptor antagonists of and thereby inhibit the activation of DP2: fevipiprant, setipiprant, ADC-3680, AZD-1981, MK-1029, MK-7246, OC-459, OC000459, QAV-680, and TM30089. Ramatroban and vidupiprant are non-selective (i.e. known to influence other receptors) antagonists of DP2.  Mechanisms of cell activation  G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as DP2 are integral membrane proteins that, when bound by their cognate ligands (or, in some cases, even when not ligand-bound and thereby acting continuously in a constitutive manner {see Receptor (biochemistry)#Constitutive activity}), mobilize one or more types of Heterotrimeric G proteins. DP2 is classified as a \\"contractile\\" prostanoid receptor in that it can cause the contraction of smooth muscle. As evidenced by its initial discovery as a receptor for PGD2 in T-helper type 2 cells, activated DP2 triggers Gi alpha subunit-linked heterotrimeric G proteins to dissociate into their component a) Gi alpha subunits (also termed GiŒ± subunits) inhibit adenylyl cyclase b) G beta-gamma complex of subunits (GŒ≤Œ≥) have many potential functions, including simulation of phospholipase C to cleave phosphatidylinositol triphosphate into inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), inhibition or stimulation of adenylyl cyclase depending on the isoform, activation of GIRK channels and activation of GRK. IP3 raises cytosolic Ca2 levels thereby regulating Ca2-sensitive signal pathways; DAG activates certain protein kinase C enzymes )PKCs) that phosphorylate and thereby regulate target proteins involved in cell signaling; and adenyl cyclase converts AMP into cyclic AMP (cAMP) thereby down-regulating cAMP- responsive proteins involved in cell signalling. Concurrently with the mobilization of these pathways, activated DP2 also mobilizes G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs, GRK2, GRK3, and/or GRK6) and Arrestin-2 (also termed Arrestin beta 1 or Œ≤-arrestin). The GRKs, along with the DAG-activated PKCs, phosphorylate DP2 to promote its internalization while arrestin-2 inhibits DP2 from further activating heterotrimeric G proteins while also linking DP2 to elements, clathrin and clathrin adaptor AP2, of the receptor internalization machinery. These pathways render DP2 unable to mobilize heterotrimereic G proteins thereby rendering the cell less sensitive or insensitive to further stimulation by DP ligands. The process, termed Homologous desensitization, serves as a physiological limiter of cell responses to DP2 activators.  Function   Allergy  Ligands that activate DP2 stimulate the in vitro chemotaxis (i.e. directed migration) of leukocytes active in mediating allergic responses viz., eosinophils, basophils, and Th2 cells. DP2 activation also stimulates eosinophils and basophils to release the many pro-allergic elements of their granules to the extracellular milieu. Ligand-induced activation of DP2 has similar activities in vivo it stimulates the accumulation on and activation of eosinophils, basophils, and Th2 cells at sites of nascent inflammation in animal models. PGD2, acting through DP2, stimulates the in vitro chemotaxis of CD8+ cells, although the contribution of this to the in vivo function of DP2 has not been clarified. PDP2 receptor antagonists have been shown to allergic reactions induced in the airways mice and sheep as well as the airways and nose of guinea pigs. Mice genetically engineered to be deficient in DP2 (i.e. DP2‚àí/-) mice are defective in mounting asthmatic responses in models of: a) allergen-induced asthma, b) dermal allergy, c) ACTH and cortisol release in response to inflammatory stimuli, and c) perception of pain caused by inflammation in peripheral tissues. DP2‚àí/- mice are also highly resistant to the gram (-) bacterial sepsis caused by cecal ligation and puncture; the protective effect was associated with lower bacterial load and lower production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e. TNF-Œ±, IL-6, and CCL3) and increased production of an anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10).  Embryogenesis  Studies in Dp2 gene-deficient (i.e. Dp2‚àí/-) mice indicate that DP2 is essential for controlling cell cycle genes in fetal testes which contribute to the arrest of mitotic process and to the differentiate of germ cells. This control involves, at least in part, the DP2-dependent activation of the male germ cell marker Nanos2 and the inhibition of meiosis through repression of Stra8.  Human genomics studies  The 1544G-1651G haplotype in the 3'-Untranslated region of the DP2 gene increased the stability of the gene's mRNA; this haplotype has been associated with an increased incidence of asthma in Chinese population and African but not Japanese sampling studies. The rs11571288 C/G Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variant of DP2 has been associated with an increase in the percentage of circulating eosinophils, an increase in the expression of DP2 by these cells, an enhanced rate of differentiation of precursor cells to Th2 cells in culture, enhanced Th2 cytokine (i.e. IL-4 and IL-13) production by these cells, and an increased incidence of asthma in a sampling of multi- ethnic Caucasian Canadians.  Clinical studies   Allergic Diseases  Setipiprant (ACT-129968), a selective, orally active antagonist of the (DP2) receptor, proved to be well tolerated and reasonably effective in reducing allergen-induced airway responses in asthmatic patient clinical trials. However, the drug, while supporting the concept that DP2 contributes to asthmatic disease, did not show sufficient advantage over existing drugs and was discontinued from further development for this application (see setipiprant). Patients with the chronic spontaneous urticarial form of hives exhibit significantly lower surface membrane expression of the DP22 receptor on their blood eosinophils and basophils, a result fully consistent with this receptor being initially activated and subsequently desensitization (refer to above section on \\"Mechanisms of cell activation\\"). The DP2 receptor antagonist, AZD1981, is in a phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticarial. A randomized, partially-blinded, placebo- controlled, two-way crossover, proof of concept study comparing the efficacy of the DP2 receptor antagonist, QAV680, in the treatment of allergic rhinitis and a study on the effectiveness of OC000459, a DP2 receptor antagonist, in reducing the exacerbation of asthma induced by experimentally-induced rhinovirus infection in subjects has just been completed or is underway, respectively.  Other diseases and conditions   Baldness  Acting through DP2, PGD2 can inhibit hair growth, suggesting that this receptor is a potential target for bald treatment.

He played college football as a center and offensive guard for the University of Michigan from 1985 to 1988. He was selected as a consensus All- American center in 1988. He later played professional football for the San Antonio Riders of the World League of American Football in 1991 and the Detroit Drive of the Arena Football League from 1993 to 1994. Early years A Detroit native, Vitale was born in 1965 and attended De La Salle Collegiate High School in Warren, Michigan. University of Michigan Vitale enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1984 and played college football for head coach Bo Schembechler's Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1985 to 1988. After redshirting in 1984, Vitale started nine games at left offensive guard for the 1985 Michigan Wolverines football team that compiled a 10-1-1 record, defeated Nebraska in the 1986 Fiesta Bowl, and finished the season ranked #2 in the AP Poll. As a sophomore, Vitale was converted to the center position and started all 13 games at that position for the 1986 Michigan team that compiled an 11-2 record and was ranked #8 in the final AP Poll. As a junior, he again started every game at center for the 1987 Michigan team and was selected as a first-team All-Big Ten Conference player. In his senior year, he started every game for Michigan, completing a streak of 37 consecutive games as Michigan's starting center. He also served as a co-captain of the 1988 Michigan team that compiled a 9-2-1 record, defeated USC 22-14 in the 1989 Rose Bowl, and was ranked #4 in the final AP Poll. At the end of the 1988 season, Vitale was selected as the consensus first-team center on the 1988 College Football All-America Team. Vitale was also known as a team leader who once showed up with a U-M winged football helmet design shaved into the side of his head. Vitale had a close relationship with his head coach, Bo Schembechler. Sportswriter Mitch Albom wrote about the following exchange between Vitale and Bo Schembechler. \\"You gonna work us today, Chief?\\" Vitale would ask. 'I'm gonna kick your butt,\\" Schembechler would say. \\"Good,\\" Vitale would answer. Professional football Vitale was not selected in the 1989 NFL Draft but attended training camp with the Houston Oilers. A recurring back injury prevented him from playing successfully in the National Football League (NFL). He did play for the San Antonio Riders of the World League of American Football in 1991 and the Detroit Drive of the Arena Football League from 1993 to 1994. Later years After his playing career ended, Vitale worked for Wolverine Human Services. His final position was as the director of a community center on the east side of Detroit that was later renamed the John S. Vitale Community Center in his honor. Vitale was diagnosed with ependymoma, cancer of the spinal cord, in 1994 at age 29. He married Lynn Abdelnour in 1998. In 1999, he found the cancer had returned and he started aggressive chemotherapy treatments. When his father told him that the cancer had spread to his brain, Vitale said, \\"Well, this sucks.\\" According to sports columnist Mitch Albom, \\"those were the only negative words anyone heard him say.\\" He died at age 34 in Grosse Pointe, Michigan.

The bone-conducted sound travels to the cochlea through different pathways. The outer ear pathway corresponds to the sound pressure generated in the ear canal cavity due to the vibration of the ear canal wall, which constitutes the source of the occlusion effect. At low frequencies, the outer ear pathway is negligible when the ear canal is open but dominates when it is occluded. The occlusion effect is thus objectively characterized by an acoustic pressure increase in the occluded ear canal at low frequencies and which can be measured with a probe-tube microphone.The \\"Occlusion Effect\\" -- What it is, and What to Do About it, by Mark Ross, January, 2004 in Hearing Loss. Accessed 25 Nov 2007.. Considering that the vibrating ear canal wall acts as an ideal source of volume velocity (also known as volumetric flow rate), the occlusion device increases the ‚Äúopposition‚Äù of the ear canal cavity to the volume velocity imposed by its wall and thus increases the amplitude of the acoustic pressure that is generated in reaction, leading to the occlusion effect Theoretical investigation of the low frequency fundamental mechanism of the objective occlusion effect induced by bone-conducted stimulationt, by K.

A person with normal hearing can experience this by sticking their fingers into their ears and talking.

Active occlusion algorithms are needed to help people with severe hearing loss adequately. If a person suffers from \\"near-normal low-frequency hearing and mild to moderate hearing loss of up to 70 dB at mid and high frequencies,\\" hearing aids with increased vent size or hollow ear-molds/domes are more suitable for them in lessening the extent of the occlusion effect.. In the latter case, the open- fitting decreases the ear canal acoustic impedance and thus the occlusion effect. For earplug users, an incomplete seal has a similar effect at frequencies lower than the Helmholtz resonance formed by the system (the neck of the resonator corresponding to the incomplete seal at the earplug/ear canal wall interface and the resonator cavity being the partially occluded ear canal). In the general case, the deep-fitting reduces the occlusion effect because the volume velocity imposed by the ear canal wall to the occluded ear canal cavity decreases since the surface as well as the vibration amplitude of the remaining ear canal wall diminish with the insertion depth.

A native of New York City, he now lives in Los Angeles. Books and thought Kotkin is the author of several books. The New Class Conflict was published in September 2014 by Telos Press Publishing. In this book, Kotkin assesses the changing complexities of class in the United States, which he argues can no longer be understood in terms of traditional political divisions between left and right or conservative and liberal. For Kotkin, the new class order of the twenty-first century is marked by the rise of a high-tech oligarchy, a culturally dominant academic and media (both journalism and entertainment) elite, an expansive government bureaucracy, and a declining middle class. In The Next Hundred Million: America in 2050 (Penguin Press, 2010), Kotkin speculated how the nation might evolve in the next four decades. Previously he authored a controversial book TRIBES: How Race, Religion and Identity are Reshaping the Global Economy positing, some say advocating for, a stateless, ethnic groups based world and global economy. He has also authored The City: A Global History and The New Geography, books about city development, and has studied various major cities, including Houston, New Orleans, New York, St. Louis, and Los Angeles.

In addition, he was a columnist for the New York Times, a business reporter at KTTV, earning a Golden Mic award for his reporting, and was West Coast editor for Inc. magazine. Kotkin argues that the model of urban development as exemplified by pre-automobile cities such as New York City and Paris is outdated in many cases. Kotkin believes in a \\"back to basics\\" approach which stresses nurturing the middle class and families with traditional suburban development. He states that the current trend of growth of suburbs will be the dominant pattern around the world. As a result, one of his arguments is that rail transit is not always ideal for modern cities and suburbs.

A nocturnal creature that is always of a male gender, there are occasional fleeting mentions of him connected with the Orkney islands but he is more frequently associated with the rivers, streams and lochs of Shetland. He is easily recognised by his distinctive wheel-like tail and, unlike his evil counterparts the each-uisge or the nuckelavee, has a fairly gentle disposition being more prone to playing pranks and making mischief rather than having malicious intents. Etymology Norsemen, predominantly from the west coast of Norway, began to settle in Shetland around the beginning of the 9th century; Norn, the primary language spoken by islanders from then until the late 17th century ‚Äì or as late as the mid-18th century ‚Äì was heavily influenced by the settlers and, like the folklore of the islands, blended Norse and Scottish characteristics. The Norsemen's impact on the folklore of the Orkney and Shetland islands was to a much higher degree than that fused through the lore of the Highlands. The Scottish National Dictionary attributes neugle and its variant spellings ‚Äì ni(o)gle, nyogle, nyugl etc. ‚Äì as coming from the Old English nicor, the Old Norse nykr, the Middle Low German or the Middle Dutch water demon, necker. The same publication gives shoopiltee and its spelling variations as adaptations of the Old Norse sj√≥ and piltr meaning sea added to boy or lad. In An Etymological Glossary of the Shetland and Orkney Dialect Thomas Edmondston lists the creature as a niogle crediting a Gothic derivation from gner for horse and el for water; he also records shoupiltin but merely catalogues it as a triton from Shetland. Folk beliefs Description and common attributes Nuggles were water spirits that inhabited the rivers, streams and small lochs of the Shetland islands; they were known as the shoopiltee or the shoepultie in some areas of Shetland particularly in the northernmost islands. Karl Blind, a 19th-century folklorist who regularly wrote about the lore of Shetland, asserts that after extensive enquiries he had only ever heard of the nuggle being in Shetland; there may however be tentative references to it around the lochs and watercourses of Hoy and at Muckle Water on Rousay which are both part of the Orkney archipelago. Tales of nuggles were never recorded on the islands of Yell and Fetlar, parts of the Shetland archipelago. The creatures were also found beside watermills and never strayed very far from water. The entity was capable of assuming many disguises but generally favoured the form of an attractive horse; he never assumed a human form. Nuggles were always male water horses or ponies and were never portrayed as mares. His overall proportions were like those of a generously fed and well-conditioned Shetland pony or horse. The colour of his sleek coat ranged from a deep bluish-grey through to a very light, almost white, grey. Similar equine type creatures are: the evil Each-uisge from the Gaelic folklore of the Scottish Highlands; the Tangies that haunt the coastline and sea shores but reside in the ocean depths; and the Norwegian n√∏kk. Folklorist Ernest Marwick considers the demonic Nuckelavee, which features in Orcadian folk tales, to also be a relative of the nuggle. Among the characteristics distinguishing the nuggle from his counterparts was his tail which resembled a wheel. The trademark tail made him easily recognisable despite his attempts to hide it between his hind legs so he tended to stay out of sight except at night or just as the sun went down in the twilight hours. Additionally, unlike other corresponding creatures, he was of a gentle disposition, more likely to instil fear rather than attacking islanders although some tales suggest otherwise; according to the author and folklorist Jessie Saxby \\"he was a more feeble sort\\". He liked playing practical jokes and making mischief but was deceitful and not very brave. Spitefulness was not a part of his character and his pranks were tempered with a degree of mercy. Only magical beings called Finns were able to ride a nuggle without coming to any harm. If the nuggle had successfully tricked an unsuspecting passer-by into mounting him, usually by pretending to be tame and standing tranquilly at the side of a path, he would immediately make for the nearest deep water. Origins Saxby suggests fear of the nuggle prevented children venturing too close to deep water or watermills and that parents embellished the tale by adding the creature was capable of producing a pleasant tune providing a child stood well away from the water. John Spence, a resident of Lerwick and author of the 1899 publication Shetland Folk-lore, agrees many of the legendary tales of spirits were told as a precaution to keep children out of danger; he further explains the tales originated in bygone times when oral traditions were passed down the generations by grandparents retelling the stories. Writing in the Journal of American Folklore during 1918 the anthropologist James Teit hypothesises that, as is common with most supernatural creatures, nuggles were thought to be fallen angels.

The orchid was first discovered by the French botanist Louis-Marie Aubert du Petit-Thouars in 1798, but was not described until 1822. It is noteworthy for its long spur and its association with the naturalist Charles Darwin, who surmised that the flower was pollinated by a then undiscovered moth with a proboscis whose length was unprecedented at the time. His prediction had gone unverified until 21 years after his death, when the moth was discovered and his conjecture vindicated. The story of its postulated pollinator has come to be seen as one of the celebrated predictions of the theory of evolution. Description A. sesquipedale flowersAngraecum sesquipedale is a monocot with monopodial growth and can grow to a height of . Its growth habit is rather similar to species in the genus Aerides. The leaves are dark green with a bit of a grayish tone and leathery with a bilobed tip. They are usually around long and wide. The roots are dark gray, thick, and emerge from the orchid's stem. There tend to be few roots and they attach to the bark of the trees quite strongly. Each of the succulent roots can extend along the trunk of the tree for several meters. There is also a variation of this species, namely A. sesquipedale var. angustifolium. A. sesquipedale var. angustifolium tends to be smaller than A. sesquipedale and has narrower leaves. The chromosome number of A. sesquipedale is 2n=42.The Arends source quotes 2n=38 in contradiction with the Jones source. A. sesquipedale has also previously gone by the synonyms Aeranthes sesquipedalis Lindl. (1824), Macroplectrum sesquipedale Pfitzer (1889), Angorchis sesquepedalis Kuntze (1891), and Mystacidium sesquipedale Rolfe (1904). Habitat It is often found in lowlands in Madagascar at altitudes below , near the east coast of the island, and on trees that are at the edge of forests. Usually it is attached to trees with fewer leaves and to areas of the branch or trunk that are driest. This allows the plant to obtain a great deal of light and air movement. Larger plants are usually found growing within 12‚Äì20 ft from the ground, whereas smaller plants are often found higher up in the canopy. Rarely A. sesquipedale is also found growing as a lithophyte and sometimes even as a semi-terrestrial. The orchid lives in an environment with heavy rainfall, up to per year.There is a contradiction in the literature as the source from F.E. Hillerman states that the plant is exclusively only found along a narrow strip on the east coast of the island that gets between 80-100 inches of rainfall a year. There is no dry season so the growing season is continuous. Flower Original drawing included in first publication of A. sesquipedale by Thouars.Star-like waxy flowers are produced on inflorescences arising from the stem from June to September in the wild with most flowers wilting by August. When cultivated in Europe however, the plant flowers between December and January.If grown in warm house conditions the plant will flower around Christmas day, while if grown in intermediate house conditions it will flower around mid-January or later. This flowering habit is what lends the orchid several of its common names, such as \\"comet orchid\\" due to the shape of its flower and \\"Christmas orchid\\" due to the timing of its flowering. Each flower opens up with a green coloration, but eventually turns white with tones of light green. The amount of green in each flower can vary from plant to plant. It is claimed that the age-dependent color change is more pronounced in wild A. sesquipedale than in greenhouse-grown plants. The sepals tend to stay green for a longer time than the petals. As the flower ages further it goes from white to yellowish and then from orange to brown as it begins to wilt. As the wilting progresses the dorsal sepal bends down and then the lateral sepals bend inward with the lip remaining fairly stationary. Finally the entire flower closes in on itself. A distinctive feature of the flowers is that they have a long green spur attached. The spur of the flower is from its tip to the tip of the flower's lip.In a paper published by Wasserthal in 1997 he quoted a spur length of 33.3¬±4.6 cm (N=15). The spur was measured from the rostellum at the spur entrance to the end of the spur lumen. The specific epithet sesquipedale is Latin for \\"one-and-a-half-feet-long\\", referring to the distance between the end of the spur and the very top of the dorsal sepal.According to F.E. Hillerman some mature species can in fact reach these lengths. At the end of the spur is a small amount of nectar usually about 40‚Äì300 ¬µl in volume. In general, longer spurs tend to have greater concentrations of nectar. This nectar fills the spur up to within from the bottom of the spur. The nectar has been found to contain the sugars fructose, sucrose, glucose, and raffinose. The flowers produce an extremely intense spicy scent that can easily fill a room; this fragrance is only present during the night and is reminiscent of lily and some nocturnally flowering Nicotiana species. The scent has been found to be composed of approximately 39 different chemical constituents with its greatest concentration consisting of isovaleraldoxime, methyl benzoate, benzyl alcohol, isovaleronitrile, benzyl benzoate, phenylethyl alcohol, isovaleraldehyde, and phenylacetaldoxime. Usually one to five flowers are produced at a time.The Warner source quotes 1‚Äì4 flowers whereas the Ellis source quotes 3‚Äì5 flowers. Reproduction Coevolution model Angraecum sesquipedale is best known within the botany community for its association with the naturalist Charles Darwin. After being sent several flowers of A. sesquipedale by James Bateman,The orchid flowers were sent unidentified and were later identified by James Bateman's son Robert Bateman in a letter to Darwin. Letter 3357 ‚Äî Bateman, Robert to Darwin, C. R., [1862], Darwin Correspondence Project. Darwin noted the defining characteristic of the species, its extremely long spur. From his observations, Darwin surmised, in his 1862 publication On the Various Contrivances by Which British and Foreign Orchids Are Fertilized by Insects, and On the Good Effects of Intercrossing, that there must be a pollinator moth with a proboscis long enough to reach the nectar at the end of the spur. He arrived at this conclusion after attempting in vain to remove the pollinia of the flower using needles and bristles. Only after placing a cylinder with a diameter of of an inch (2.5 mm) down the full length of the spur was he able to detach the pollinia upon retracting it. The viscidium attached to the cylinder as he removed it. Darwin surmised that during the moth's attempt at getting the nectar at the end of the spur, the moth would get the pollinarium attached to itself. The next orchid it visited would then be pollinated in the same manner. For some time after this prediction the notion of a pollinator with a 35 cm long proboscis was ridiculed and generally not believed to exist. After Darwin's publication, George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll published a book in 1867 titled, The Reign of Law, in which he argued that the complexity of this species implied that it was created by a supernatural being. Alfred Russel Wallace replied in the same year with a paper he titled \\"Creation by Law\\", setting out in detail a sequence through which the moth and the flower could have coevolved with no guidance other than natural selection. In 1903, such a moth was discovered in Madagascar by Walter Rothschild and Karl Jordan.The J.A. Fowlie source claims that the moth was first discovered by a missionary in the 1880s and subsequently the moth found its way into Humboldt's collection in 1882. All other sources, however, accredit Rothschild and Jordan as the discoverers. This confirmed Darwin's prediction. The moth was named Xanthopan morganii praedicta. It is possible that the subspecific epithet praedicta was given in honor of the fact that Darwin predicted its existence, but there is no reference to Darwin in the paper that described the moth. A more conservative explanation is simply that the existence of the moth had been predicted and widely accepted before it was discovered.Original drawing included in first publication of A. sesquipedale by Thouars. In 1873 William Alexander Forbes wrote an article in the journal Nature asking readers if they knew of the moth predicted by Darwin. A reply to the question was first made that same year by Hermann M√ºller. He announced that his brother Fritz M√ºller had discovered a moth with a proboscis of long, but it was discovered in Brazil and so was not a candidate for pollinating A. sesquipedale. Although Darwin learned of M√ºller's finding he did not live to see the discovery of Xanthopan morganii. Even after the 1903 discovery however, news of Xanthopan morganii praedicta was not immediately disseminated. A second inquiry into the existence of the pollinator moth was made in the 30 January 1907 issue of the journal Nature by E. W. Swanton. Presumably still unaware of Rothschild and Jordan's discovery, Wallace responded stating that he didn't know of a suitable pollinator in Madagascar, but that he had heard of one from East Africa with a long enough proboscis. Both Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace had suggested that the evolutionary basis for how the odd relationship between the sphinx moth and A. sesquipedale evolved over time could be understood by considering one orchid with a long spur and another with a short spur. If a moth goes to fertilize a flower with a short spur its proboscis would easily reach all the way to the bottom of the spur and it would get the nectar. However, since the proboscis of the moth is longer than the spur of the flower, the head of the moth would not touch the flower obtaining the pollinarium and so the flower would not be fertilized. The orchid with the longer spur on the other hand would be able to be fertilized since the entire length of the proboscis fits within the spur and thus allowing the head of the moth to touch the flower and become connected to the pollinarium. As a result, over time plants with longer spurs would be more likely to reproduce and so become more prevalent in the population. In this way A. sesquipedale has evolved to have a very long spur. The moth too would evolve to have a longer and longer proboscis in the following way. If a moth goes to fertilize an A. sesquipedale flower and the spur is longer than its proboscis then it will not be able to reach all of the nectar. As such, moths with too short of a proboscis would not be able to get as much food as those moths with a longer proboscis who could reach all of the nectar. Due to this arrangement moths with longer proboscis would become more physically fit to reproduce due to their ability to get more nectar and so such moths would become more prevalent in the population. This can result in a seesawing effect by which both organisms produce a mechanism that leads the other to increase the others spur and proboscis. There are however certain properties that no doubt prevent this mechanism from continuing indefinitely. For example, the risk such a long proboscis poses to a moth could be a factor that would prevent the spur of A. sesquipedale from becoming indefinitely long. If moths with proboscises that were too cumbersomely long substantially risked their lives due to being easier prey, then such moths could only afford to evolve a proboscis to a certain length. This would in turn restrict the length of the orchid's spur, since moths would not want to visit flowers whose spurs were too long since they would not be able to reach the nectar. There was also another explanation why the spur of A. sesquipedale grew so long proposed by Thomas Belt in his 1874 book The Naturalist in Nicaragua. Belt suggested that the spur grew long in order to prevent other moths with shorter proboscises from drinking the nectar. Darwin took up this explanation briefly in a footnote of the second edition of his famous orchid book, explaining that although this explanation was no doubt true, it cannot account for the lengthening spur. An illustration by Thomas William Wood, based on Alfred Russel Wallace's description, showing a moth pollinating A. sesquipedale. This was Wallace's conception of the event since it was drawn in 1867 before the moth was even discovered. The fertilization of A. sesquipedale has been observed to proceed as follows. The moth approaches the flower to ascertain by scent whether or not it is the correct orchid species. Then the moth backs up over a foot and unrolls its proboscis, then flies forward, inserting it into a cleft in the rostellum which leads to the spur while gripping the labellum. After the moth has finished drinking the nectar, which usually takes about 6 seconds, it instinctively raises its head while removing its proboscis from the spur, and in doing so causes the viscidium to adhere to its proboscis usually about from its base. Attached to the viscidium via the caudicle is the pollinia. Upon removing its proboscis from the flower, the pollinarium stalk will be straight and parallel with the moth's proboscis. Then after leaving the orchid the caudicle will eventually dry out, causing its angle relative to the moth's proboscis to change by 90¬∞ so that it is at the correct angle to attach to the stigma of the next orchid the moth visits. The moth then repeats this process at another A. sesquipedale orchid and simultaneously fertilizes it. Once the flower has been fertilized, it quickly stops producing its powerful scent. Pollinator shift model An alternative path by which A. sesquipedale could have evolved that differed with Darwin and Wallace's explanation was proposed by Lutz Thilo Wasserthal in 1997. According to Wasserthal, hawk moths could have evolved long proboscises as a predatory avoidance strategy from heteropodid spiders. Since such spiders have been known to jump at hovering moths in an attempt at eating them, hawk moths would be at risk when visiting flowers if such a spider was nearby. Based on this reasoning moths with longer tongues would be less at risk when pollinating flowers since they would be farther away and thus a more challenging target for jumping spiders. As a result, nature would select for hawk moths with longer and longer probosces. The flowers of A. sesquipedale on the other hand would be evolving longer spurs since flowers with longer spurs are more likely to become fertilized by long tongued moths. In other words, the flowers evolve long spurs to fit the pollinators and not the reverse. It has also been observed that the moths will swing side to side when feeding, presumably to evade jumping spiders. Possible problems with this hypothesis is that active predation by spiders on hawk moths visiting flowers has not been observed. It has also been suggested that flying predators such as bats and birds are the more likely predators to hawk moths. Whether or not the pollinator shift model or the coevolution model, or even a little bit of both are correct is currently the subject of debate. Related species In 2017, Netz and Renner provided molecular clock-dated phylogenies that include 62 of 144 Angraecum species on Madagascar and all nine Madagascan Sphinginae. Clock models using either rate- or fossil-based calibrations imply that the Madagascan subspecies praedicta and the African subspecies morgani diverged 7.4 ¬± 2.8 Mya, which overlaps the divergence of A. sesquipedale from its sister, A. sororium, namely 7.5 ¬± 5.2 Mya; since both these orchids have extremely long spurs, long spurs likely existed before that. Cultivation A. sesquipedale in bud Angraceum sesquipedale was first brought to the United Kingdom in 1855 to be grown outside of its natural environment by William Ellis. Subsequently, Ellis achieved the first flowering of the plant in cultivation in 1857. Angraecum sesquipedale has been attributed as having a nicer appearance when grown in cultivation than when found in the wild, since wild specimens appear as a long stem surrounded by a few struggling leaves. Additionally, A. sesquipedale is seldom grown in private collections, despite its enormous importance to Darwin's concept of coevolution and subsequently the fields of botany and evolutionary biology. A. sesquipedale flower It is often recommended that A. sesquipedale be grown under warm to intermediate conditions and given as much light as possible without burning the leaves.F.E. Hillerman stated in an Orchid Digest article that 3,000-4,000 footcandles is not too much. The choice of growing the plant in intermediate or warm housing conditions can affect the timing of the flowering. In order to stimulate heavy flower production it is important that the light intensity be greatest between September and November. The number of flower spikes present during flowering is dependent on the number of new leaf- pairs formed during the preceding spring and summer, since each newly formed leaf-pair produce one spike and rarely two. Angraecum sesquipedale is commonly found to have a slow growth habit, but the orchid can be expected to produce flowers even before it has reached an adult size.F.E. Hillerman stated in an Orchid Digest article that the plant can begin flowering after only four years after having first sowed the seeds, which would correspond with a height of 6 inches. Angraecum sesquipedale is notorious for having sensitive roots. The roots of mature plants are best left undisturbed as much as possible and as a result it is prudent to be especially careful during repotting. Young plants however are less susceptible to such root problems. Disturbing the roots can cause the plant to sulk for two to four years or even to cause it to die. When a mature plant is disturbed it frequently loses many of its lower leaves and reverts to only producing one or two flowers at a time. To avoid these problems it is commonly advised that the orchid be planted in a coarse medium such as fir bark, crock, or charcoal to minimize disturbances to the roots. Also planting it in a basket or large pot is best since this allows the orchid to grow for many years before having to have its roots disturbed. Hybrids The first Angraecum hybrid was created by John Seden, an employee of Veitch Nurseries, and exhibited for the first time on 10 January 1899. It was named A. Veitchii, but it also commonly goes by the name King of the Angraceum hybrids. The cross was between A. sesquipedale and A. eburneum.There is some ambiguity in the literature as to the parentage of this hybrid. Some sources claim that the seed parent is A. eburneum subsp. superbum, while the majority of the sources like the Royal Horticultural Society claims it's simply A. eburneum and that (A. eburneum subsp. superbum √ó A. sesquipedale) should be called Angcm. Memoria Mark Aldridge. The flowers somewhat resemble those of A. leonis. Additionally, the hybrid combines the traits controlling the flower's post-pollination changes. In the case of A. eburneum the flowers age such that the labellum curls inward with the sepals and lateral petals remaining mostly stationary whereas in the case of A. sesquipedale both the sepals and petals move except for the labellum. In the case of A. Veitchii both the petals, sepals, and labellum move inward. Another common cross involving A. sesquipedale is A. Crestwood, which is a cross between A. Veitchii and A. sesquipedale.

She switched to volleyball following her father‚Äôs advice that volleyball was more fun and more likely to become popular. Afterwards, a volleyball coach of Bodindecha (Sing Singhaseni) School in Bangkok was so impressed by her playing that he brought her to the school during her high-school level. At first, she did not play as a middle blocker but an outside hitter.http://shows.voicetv.co.th/voice-of-the- day/9254.html Pleumjit was first capped for the national junior team in 2000. A year later, she was chosen to join the national team. She went to play professional volleyball overseas for the first time in China for a month when she was 20 years old. Pleumjit got her bachelor's degree and master's degree in Business Administration from Rattana Bundit University Bangkok.

The league competes primarily in the New York metropolitan area and northern New Jersey. History In 1923, five teams, S.C. New York, Wiener Sports Club, D.S.C. Brooklyn, Hoboken FC 1912 and Newark S.C., banded together to found the German American Soccer League. As the name suggests, the teams were largely composed of recent immigrants from Central Europe, primarily Germany. The next year, four more teams, Swiss F.C., Elizabeth S.C., S.C. Eintracht and Germania S.C., joined the league. The league renamed itself the German American Football Association in 1927. While the GASL began as a single division league, it added a junior division in 1933. That year, the league also held its first indoor tournament. In addition to its junior division, the GASL also added several lower divisions over the decades. In 1943, all of the U.S. leagues suffered from significant player losses from the U.S. participation in World War II. In order to continue to play a competitive schedule, the GASL joined with the Eastern District Soccer League to run a joint season. Following the end of the war in 1945, the GASL found itself turning from a lack of quality players to an overabundance as Central European professionals left their war ravaged countries to move to the United States. The league experienced a second influx of talented players when Hungarians fled their country following the Soviet Union crushing the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. In 1964, the GASL joined with the professional American Soccer League in a short lived experiment. That year, the two leagues formed the Eastern Professional Soccer Conference which competed during the GASL/ASL off season. The league was a failure and did not complete its one season in existence. While the merger with the ASL was less than successful, the GASL undertook a cooperative agreement with another league, this time the International Soccer League (ISL) in 1965. That season, the GASL All Star team entered the ISL as the New Yorker, going to the final where it lost to Polonia Bytom 5-1. The string of league mergers continued in 1974 when the National Soccer League of New York merged into the GASL. In 1977, the GASL changed its name in response to a changing American soccer scene. While soccer had existed as an ethnic sport since the 1930s, the creation of the North American Soccer League in 1968 had brought the sport into the mainstream. Recognizing that maintaining its ethnic identity would hinder its acceptance by the wider U.S. sports culture, the GASL governing board voted to rename the league the Cosmopolitan Soccer League. As part of this process, the league‚Äôs teams were directed to change their names to ones with less ethnic connotations, although this requirement was dropped three years later. Despite the regional and semi- professional nature of the league, it featured many of the top U.S. player in the 1950s and 1960s. Even into the early 1970s, GASL players appeared regularly with the U.S. national team. The high regard afforded to the league is reflected in that the National Soccer Hall of Fame considers the GASL as one of a handful of leagues in which a player may become eligible for entry into the Hall of Fame. New York Cosmos The GASL had named an All Star team beginning in 1930. In 1968, after the newly established North American Soccer League approached the GASL about placing a GASL team in the NASL, the league formed its All Star team, known as the Cosmos, into an exhibition team. The Cosmos did not enter the NASL until the 1971 season, but when it did, it was well stocked with former GASL players.

Highly purified ulinastatin has been clinically used for the treatment of acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, Stevens‚ÄìJohnson syndrome, burns, septic shock, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). The drug is used in Japan, where its brand name is Miraclid, as well as in South Korea, China, and India. In India, where it is approved to treat severe sepsis and acute pancreatitis, it is marketed under the brand name Ulinase and U-Tryp. It is also known by the names Bikunin and Urinastatin. In China, where it is approved to treat acute pancreatitis, chronic recurrent pancreatitis and acute circulatory failure, it is marketed under the brand name Techpool Roan.  Effectiveness  Ulinastatin is available in countries like China, Japan and India for the management of sepsis and acute pancreatitis. In Japan, It is clinically used to treat endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)-induced pancreatitis. Studies in Japan have documented a reduction in the incidence of ERCP-induced pancreatitis with the use of ulinastatin. In one study, the incidence of hyperenzymemia and pancreatitis was significantly lower in the ulinastatin group than in the placebo group.Sujino T, Komatsu Y, Isayama H, Hirano K, Sasahira N, Yamamoto N, Toda N, et al. Ulinastatin for pancreatitis after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography: A randomized, controlled trial. Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol2005;3:376. In another study, ulinastatin reduced serum, drain amylase, and the incidence of postoperative pancreatitis following pancreaticoduodenectomy.Uemura K, Murakami Y, Hayashidani Y, Sudo T, Hashimoto Y, Ohge H, Sueda T. Randomized clinical trial to assess the efficacy of ulinastatin for postoperative pancreatitis following pancreaticoduodenectomy. J Surg Oncol2008;98:309-13. A study conducted in India found that mortality from all causes over 22 days in subjects with severe pancreatitis was lower among those receiving ulinastatin than those receiving placebo (2.8% versus 18.8%; p=0.048), resulting in a 16% absolute reduction in the risk of death and a relative reduction of 85%. The results indicated that in this population, one life would be saved for every 6.25 subjects treated with ulinastatin. New organ dysfunction was seen in 12 subjects with severe pancreatitis on ulinastatin and 29 on placebo (p=0.0026).Journal of the association of physicians of India ‚Ä¢August 2013 ‚Ä¢VOL. 61 :15-18 Mechanism of action Ulinastatin is an acid-resistant protease inhibitor found in human urine and released from the high-molecular- weight precursor I alpha T1. It inactivates many serine proteases, including trypsin, chymotrypsin, kallikrein, plasmin, granulocyte elastase, cathepsin, thrombin, and factors IXa, Xa, XIa, and XlIa. However, although ulinastatin is a protease inhibitor, its activity toward various proteases is relatively weak. Ulinastatin protein has been found in the brain, liver, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, cartilage, plasma, ovarian follicular fluid, amniotic fluid, and urine. Its mRNA has been detected only in the liver, kidney, heart, lungs, and pancreas. The presence of ulinastatin in certain tissues appears to be due to diffusional uptake and retention through cell surfaces. Ulinastatin also potentiates local anti-proteolytic activity on the extracellular matrix (ECM) during tissue remodeling, possibly through noncovalent binding to TSG-6. Its secretion is upregulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha. These cytokines also enhance the synthesis of intracellular I alpha T1 proteins and IL-1beta upregulated ulinastatin. Ulinastatin is implicated in downregulating or suppressing the production of proMMP-1 and proMMP, prostaglandin H2 synthase-2, urokinase, CXC chemokine, pro-inflammatory cytokines, inducible nitric oxide synthase, tissue factor, P-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases, and NF-kappaB activation. Ulinastatin also suppresses neutrophil accumulation and activity. The genes and proteins regulated by ulinastatin are implicated in the inflammatory process. Therefore, ulinastatin is not just a protease inhibitor, but can also prevent inflammation and cytokine-dependent signaling pathways. In preclinical and clinical studies, ulinastatin protected against acute lung injury, graft ischemia/reperfusion injury, renal failure after cardiopulmonary bypass, severe burn injury, septic shock, preterm birth, tumor invasion, and metastasis. Its anti-metastatic properties may come from the inhibition of cell-bound plasmin activity. Ulinastatin also prevents tumor progression, partially by inhibiting cathepsin B activity. In particular, ulinastatin is thought to inhibit CD44 dimerization and suppress the MAP kinase signaling cascade, thus preventing ECM degradation, tumor cell invasion, and angiogenesis. Altogether, ulinastatin plays an important role not only in the protection of organ injury during severe inflammation, but also in the inhibition of tumor invasion and metastasis.Inflamm. Res. (2010) 59:679‚Äì687 DOI 10.1007/s00011-010-0205-5, J.Clin.Biochem. Nut., 43,139-142, November 2008 Dosage and administration Patients are typically given one or two 100,000 I.U. vials of ulinastatin (reconstituted in 100 ml of dextrose 5% or 100 ml of 0.9% normal saline) by intravenous infusion over the course of one hour, one to three times per day for three to five days. The dosage may be adjusted according to patients' age and the severity of symptoms.https://www.google.co.in/?gws_rd=cr&ei;=otZDUomXFYLrrQeE2IGIDg#q=ulinastatin+prescribing+information  References  Protease inhibitors ","title":"Ulinastatin"},{"id":"14429876","text":"Paul Raymond Henderson (born 15 August 1962)Paul Henderson profile, Northern Territory Legislative Assembly is a former Australian politician who was Chief Minister of the Northern Territory from 2007 to 2012.

Henderson was promoted to cabinet in 2001 after Labor won a Territory election for the first time in 2001. He held the following ministries: Minister for Employment, Education and Training; Minister for Tourism; Minister for Public Employment; and Minister for Multicultural Affairs, until he became Chief Minister of the Northern Territory after the sudden resignation of Clare Martin on 26 November 2007.Henderson confirmed as new NT Chief Minister, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 26 November 2007. He became the first man to lead an ALP Government in the Territory. At the 2008 territory election, Henderson lost most of the large majority he'd inherited from Martin. Partly because new electoral boundaries had been gazetted just days before the writs were issued, most of the Labor members elected in the massive Labor landslide of 2005 were unable to connect with their new constituents. Ultimately, Labor needed a paper-thin victory in Martin's old seat of Fannie Bay to retain government with 13 of 25 seats, a one-seat majority. In August 2009, Labor MLA Alison Anderson resigned from the ALP after a disagreement with Henderson's government over housing in remote indigenous areas. The opposition Country Liberal Party moved a motion of no-confidence against Henderson, which was defeated by one vote after Henderson reached an agreement with Independent MLA Gerry Wood to support his government.NT Labor survives crisis of confidence, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 14 August 2009. At the 2012 territory election, Henderson's government was defeated by the opposition Country Liberal Party led by Terry Mills.

Alexandra Park is bounded by Dundas Street West on the north, Spadina Avenue on the east, Queen Street West on the south, and Bathurst Street on the west. Alexandra Park consists of private and public housing, with at grade retail along Queen Street West and Spadina Avenue, some institutional, and several commercial buildings scattered through the neighborhood. The neighborhood takes its name from Alexandra Park, a municipal park at the south-east corner of Dundas Street West and Bathurst Street. The park is named for Queen Alexandra, wife of King Edward VII, the first future monarch to visit Toronto. History The recorded history of the area begins with the original survey of the northern shore of Lake Ontario conducted by Augustus Jones in 1791. The survey established a baseline soon to be called Lot Street (later renamed Queen Street). The area now known as Alexandra Park was then the southern portions of lots 16, 17 and 18 of Concession 1 of the Township of York. When the City of Toronto was incorporated in 1834, it included the area 400 yards to the north of Queen Street, roughly the location of present-day Grange Street. The remainder of the area was annexed by the city in 1859. Gzowski Hall at Alexandra Hall, 1896. A branch of the Toronto Public Library presently occupies the site of the Hall. The area was purchased from the Denison family in 1841 by Sir Casimir Gzowski, a Polish engineer who built his grand home, which he called 'The Hall', at what is now the south-east corner of Dundas St. W. and Bathurst St. A neighbourhood sprang up around Gzowski's home that was inhabited largely by Polish and Ukrainian immigrants in the 1920s and 1930s. In the 1960s, 'The Hall' and many of the surrounding homes were demolished to make way for a public housing project. The public housing projects brought in many immigrants from the Caribbean, East Africa, China and Vietnam. Alexandra Park is known for having one of the largest African Canadian communities in Toronto, and people of African American ancestry are still evident in this neighbourhood. In the 1970s and '80s, there were racial tensions between the established Polish and Ukrainian immigrants and the new immigrants. An infamous African Canadian gang called the Project Originals emerged. Drugs and violence were a huge problem, and during this time, a crack epidemic swept the area. In the early '90s, a group of Alexandra Park residents sought to convert the government housing complex to self-governing co-operative housing, in order to attempt to make a difference in the struggling community in an effort to stop the oppression and drug wars the project had been facing for many decades previous. Today Alexandra Park is recovering from its harsh battles in the past, and making an effort to turn a new leaf. Future After a long period of community consultation, The Toronto Community Housing Corporation has completed plans for a major revitalization of Atkinson Co-op and surrounding areas of Alexandra Park.

He began playing organized soccer with the semi-professional Bayonne Rangers‚Äô youth team in 1933 with his size leading to his being put in the net. While playing for the Rangers, Olaff also competed with the Bayonne High School soccer team, graduating to the Rangers‚Äô senior team by the time he finished high school. Professional In 1936, Olaff left the Rangers to sign with the professional New York Brookhattan of the American Soccer League (ASL).

In May 1946 he twice played against a touring Liverpool side, representing the New York region and the American Soccer League. Liverpool manager George Kay told the Liverpool Echo newspaper that he was good enough for the English 1st Division but there was no chance of persuading him to give up a police career that allowed him to retire on a pension at the age of fifty.Liverpool Echo 27 May 1946 He retired from football in 1953.

This included time as a janitor, shipping clerk and a metal finisher with General Motors. During World War II, Olaff was inducted into the U.S. Navy, becoming a diver. He spent his first year in the Navy attending diving schools on the east coast, allowing him to continue competing with Hispano.

It includes about 47 major and some 6,300 of varying size, of which about 3,500 are permanent and 2,800 are seasonal. These area is low because of subsidence of tectonic Dauki fault. In the geological depression of the basin, subsidence is continuing at an estimated rate of 20 mm per year. In some places it has sunk by around 10 m in the last few hundred years. The area, by some experts, is further divided into three zones by standards of morphology and hydrology: *The piedmont area: This area around the foothills of the Himalaya is the most elevated zone. This area is an accretion zone where rapid siltation of coarser materials take place along the levees by flash floods. Across the down-slope of levees lie the backswamp, acting as reservoir by storing water and substantially reducing flood peak downstream. *The floodplain area: The floodplains, with milder slopes, are located at the middle of the basin. This zone receive sediments that is moderately finer and considerably lower in volume. Backswamps along this section fill and drain several times in each monsoon, helping to reduce flood peak downstream. *The deeply flooded area: This deepest part of the wetlands is known more as the . During monsoon the and floodplains become deeply flooded and turn into a single water reservoir, especially in the Surma-Kushiyara-Meghna basin. Soil within the same system can vary in texture, drainage class, fertility, and other parameters. The transition from the wettest to the driest areas in the floodplains occurs over distances varying from several kilometers to several meters. Climate and floods Villages appear to be islands in a The basin is a remote and difficult area that is flooded every year during monsoon. The climate of the area is subtropical monsoonal with an average annual rainfall of approximately 4,000 mm. Over 80% of the rain falls during the monsoon season from June to October. Temperatures normally vary between 26 and 31 ¬∞C in the pre-monsoon period (March to May), 28 to 31 ¬∞C in the rainy season, and 26 to 27 ¬∞C in winter. Some of the most extensive seasonally flooded areas in South Asia are situated in bowl-shaped depressions known as located between the natural levees of rivers subject to overflow during the monsoon. The major rivers in the area are Surma and Kushiyara. Some of the tributaries are: Manu, Khowai, Jadukhata, Piyain, Mogra, Mahadao and Kangsha. These form the dense drainage network of the . The rivers are primarily responsible for providing inputs - rainwater and sediment load to the basin. The hilly rivers coming down from the Khasi and Jaintia hills in Meghalaya carry particularly high volumes of water as they come from some of the rainiest places in the world.Bandopadhyay, Dilip Kumar, Bharater Nadi (Rivers of India), 2002, , p. 78, Bharati Book Stall, 6B Ramanath Mazumdar Street, Kolkata During July to November due to flood these areas go under deep water and look like seas with erosive water surface. During wind storm these waves reach up to 1.5 m in height. It remains under water for seven months of the year, turning settlements mostly built on earthen mounds into islands. During the dry season most of the water drains out, leaving small shallow lakes or may completely dry out by the end of dry season. This exposes rich alluvial soil, extensively cultivated for rice. The fight against natural calamity of the locals people, mostly day laborers, relies on traditional and indigenous methods which with limited effect. Many villages have already been washed away, and many more are on the verge of extinction, forcing people to migrate to urban centers. Environment Compared with other major natural forms of landscape, a wetland is young, dynamic and physically unstable. Variously called jalah, doloni, pitoni, doba, hola or gadeng,Vijay P. Singh, Nayan Sharma, C. Shekhar P. Ojha; The Brahmaputra Basin Water Resources; page 366; Springer; 2004; it can change in a season or even in a single storm, as conditions range from virtually perennial aquatic lowlands to seasonally dry uplands. It changes with the vegetation, sedimentation, or geological subsidence. The key to vegetation development and community dynamics here is hydroperiod, affected by topography, flooding and flood type, precipitation, and water table fluctuations. Flora Lowland plants, emergent grass and aquatic plants in basin Due to continuous submergence, wetland habitat is characterized by anaerobic conditions which inhibits normal plant growth apart from a group of plants known as hydrophytes are adapted to withstand these conditions. The Haor Basin is the only region in Bangladesh where remnant patches of freshwater swamps and reed lands still exists. Once extensive forests of Hijal in the area used to provide an important source of firewood, but these forests are now almost completely destroyed. In recent times, various herbs and aquatic plants are being collected for use as fuel. On top of that, aquatic plants are also being collected for use as fertilizers. Only a few patches remain of the swamp forests that once dominated the area, featuring flood tolerant trees like Hijal (Barringtonia acutangula) and Koroch (Pongamia pinnata). Joseph Dalton Hooker (1817-1911) did the original survey of local flora sometime in 1850, recorded in his Himalayan Journals (published by the Calcutta Trigonometrical Survey Office and The Minerva Library of Famous Books; Ward, Lock, Bowden & Co., 1891). The findings of his travels along the Surma and visiting the wetlands of Sylhet are reflected in his Flora of British India. Three habitat types in the Sylhet region were identified on the basis of botanical records of Kanjilal (U.N. Kanjilal, P.C. Kanjilal & A. Das; Flora of Assam; 1934): * Upland vegetation: Plants at the fringe and at all higher levels, including Crataeva, Terminalia, Lagerstroemia, Ardisia, Trewia, Ficus and Clinogyne. * Emergent vegetation: grasses include Hygroryza, Panicum, Phragmites, and Arundo. * Aquatic vegetation: These include Nymphaeaceae, Araceae, Lemnaceae, Alismataceae, Najadaceae, Eriocaulaceae and Cyperaceae. The hijal or hual, korij or koroch, bhui dumur (Ficus heterophylla), nol (Arundo donax), khagra (Pharagmites karka), ban golap (Rosa involucratia) and barun (Crataeva nurvala) are the main plant species found in the swamp forests. All of them are flood-tolerant species and can survive in the submerged condition for extended periods of time. However, among these, hijal, tamal and koroj trees are of the greatest value to the people and the environment. Other plant species available in the wetlands include madar (Erythrina variegata), gab (Diospyros peregrina), makna (Euryale ferox), singara (Trapa bispinosa), jaldumur (a kind of Ficus), chitki (Phyllanthus reticulatus), thankuni (Centella asiatica), kalmi (Ipomoea aquatica), helencha (Enhydra flactuans), hogla (Typha elephantina), duckweed, water hyacinth, lotus and water lily. Eight plant communities have been identified in the area (number of species in parentheses): submerged plants (20), free floating plants (15), rooted floating plants (15), sedges and meadows (35), floodplain grassland,Floodplain grassland includes sedge/meadow and reed swamp species, as well as grass species reed swamp (7), fresh water swamp forest (7), crop field vegetation (60), and homestead vegetation (63). Fauna About 207 species of birds live or visit Bangladesh. Among the birds 30% are waterfowls, 26% waders, 20% bush and her bland birds and the rest are grassland, air hawking prey. Of these fresh water birds 129 species (62.3%) are resident and the other are migratory. The list of extinct wetland birds include spotbill pelican, pelican, scavenger vulture, Bengal florican, pinkheaded duck, greater adjutant and king vulture. There are several endangered species. Poachers pose the biggest danger to migratory birds. Although the Wildlife Preservation Act prohibits the hunting of migratory birds and wild animals, the law is not being implemented. Open sales of wild and migratory birds in the cities are flagrant. Guest birds trapped in Sylhet's are held captive in Srimangal town for sale in other cities. The poachers take advantage of the people's lack of awareness of the importance of migratory birds. While poaching, killing of birds, and their open sale in towns continues, it would be wrong to say that in Bangladesh there is no place where birds are safe from harm. In Kanglar in Sunamganj, guest birds are neither shot nor caught. Near the is the Birampur village, where people understand that as part of Mother Nature guest birds need to be cherished, not hunted. The local panchayet in this village banned the killing of birds in 2001. The initiative to save the birds was taken by Abdus Samad, an elderly villager, whose step has become a united move worthy of replication. The extinct fauna of the area includes a few species that are included in the IUCN Red Data Book as highly endangered species, including one-horned rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis), swamp deer (Cervus duvauceli), hispid hare (Caprolagus hispidus), swamp partridge (Francolinus gularis), Bengal florican (Eupodotis bengalensis) and marsh babbler (Pellorneum palustre). Conservation The international significance of the wetlands of the basin for their waterfowl populations was first drawn to the attention of the international conservation community at an International Regional Meeting on Conservation of Wildfowl Resources held in Saint Petersburg in September 1968. The Directory of Asian Wetlands (Scott, 1989), based on studies conducted by Abdul Wahab Akonda of the Forest Department, and by S.M.A. Rashid and Raguib Uddin Ahmed of the Wildlife Society of Bangladesh, identifies the wetlands of the basin, including ten key sites, of Sylhet and Mymensingh as a wetland ecosystem of outstanding international importance. Six of these key sites - Tanguar , Pashua and Gurmar , Hakaluki , Hail , Kawadighi , Balai - has been identified by Bangladesh Flood Action Plan as of outstanding national and international importance. Three zones of international importance for conservation and sustainable utilization - the Meghna estuary, and Hail- - have been declared as Ramsar sites under the Ramsar Convention for protection of wetlands, of which Bangladesh is a signatory. The Bangladesh government has also declared the Tanguar an Ecologically Critical Area. The Haor basin has a number of government bodies working to preserve the environment, including the Forest Resources Management Project, Management of Aquatic Ecosystem through Community Husbandry, Haor and Floodplain Resource, Conservation and Management of Medicinal Plants and Coastal and Wetland Biodiversity Management at Cox's Bazar and Hakaluki Haor.Convention on Biological Diversity , page 1, Department of Environment, Government of Bangladesh; Retrieved: 2007-12-05 Human habitation A police patrol speed boat in the region Bamboo market at Pashukhali Fishing is a major livelihood A regular passenger launch at Mohanganj Prior to the 12th century there is almost no information available on the human habitation here. The information up to the 17th century is sketchy. During the British period, this area was not stringently surveyed, and not a lot of information is available. It is believed that the early settlers of the area were Hindus and other ethnic groups including Garo, Hajong, Khasi and Koch people coming down from the hills to the north. They were drawn to the area because of its productivity and favorable tenurial terms. With the expansion of Muslim power in the south and the west further Hindu migration continued in the 13th and 14th century. Following an Afghan defeat in Orissa in 1592, a large number of Afghans moved into the area. Expansion of Muslim population continued after the Muslim conquest of Sylhet in 1612, accelerating after the British conquest of Sylhet in 1765. By the 1770s all the cultivable land was brought under plough cultivation. From the 1780s, population and area under cultivation declined till early 20th century, mostly due to successive natural calamities including floods and earthquakes. The basin became an important fishing zone during this time. Population growth picked up again in the 20th century, again due to the opportunity to cultivate land for a nominal rent. In the region, villages are tightly nucleated and built on the natural levees (locally known as kandas). The villages are very large in size because no settlement can take place beyond the levees. During the dry cropping season, the satellite villages are established deep inside beds, far from parent villages. After harvesting and before inundation, the village structures are dismantled and transported back to parent villages along with harvests.Village, Banglapedia, Asiatic Society Economy These and support major subsistence and commercial fisheries, while the seasonally flooded lake margins support major rice-growing activities, and the abundant aquatic vegetation provides rich grazing for domestic livestock and an alternative source of fuel and fertilisers for the local people. The main crop grown in the basin is boro rice or dry season rice. Early monsoon flash floods often cause extensive damage to the boro crop. Protection in the form of full flood dykes or submersible dykes is being provided in some of the developed areas. Among the varieties of rice cultivated in winter, the Boro season, in the knee-deep water of marshlands, the Hashi (BR-17), the Shahjalal (BR-18) and the Mongol (BR-19) varieties are best suited for the areas. and , along with the rivers, canals and the floodplain, are a major source of fish production. But, due to silting, and excessive harvesting of fish to meet the demand of growing populations production of fish from this source is gradually dwindling.National Fisheries Policy, Ministry Of Fisheries And Livestock, Government of Bangladesh, 1998; Retrieved: 2007-12-03 In recent years, the wetlands have also been used for rearing domestic ducks. Due to scarcity of cultivable land, government lands ( land) including the wetlands are increasing getting transferred to private ownership in Bangladesh. Thus most of the and have now been sold or leased to private individuals for cultivation during the dry season. This transfer is governed by the Haor Development Board Ordinance (Ordinance No. IX of 1977) are under the direct control of the Revenue Department in the Ministry of Land Administration and Land Reforms. Tourism are unique wetlands and have started attracting tourists, although in limited numbers. The best time to visit the haors is at the end of the monsoons, say around August‚ÄìSeptember, when they are full with water.

The formula, giving the probability of a diabatic (not adiabatic) transition between the two energy states, was published separately by Lev Landau, Clarence Zener, Ernst Stueckelberg, and Ettore Majorana, in 1932. If the system starts, in the infinite past, in the lower energy eigenstate, we wish to calculate the probability of finding the system in the upper energy eigenstate in the infinite future (a so-called Landau‚ÄìZener transition). For infinitely slow variation of the energy difference (that is, a Landau‚ÄìZener velocity of zero), the adiabatic theorem tells us that no such transition will take place, as the system will always be in an instantaneous eigenstate of the Hamiltonian at that moment in time. At non-zero velocities, transitions occur with probability as described by the Landau‚ÄìZener formula.  Conditions and approximation  Such transitions occur between states of the entire system, hence any description of the system must include all external influences, including collisions and external electric and magnetic fields. In order that the equations of motion for the system might be solved analytically, a set of simplifications are made, known collectively as the Landau‚ÄìZener approximation. The simplifications are as follows: # The perturbation parameter in the Hamiltonian is a known, linear function of time # The energy separation of the diabatic states varies linearly with time # The coupling in the diabatic Hamiltonian matrix is independent of time The first simplification makes this a semi-classical treatment. In the case of an atom in a magnetic field, the field strength becomes a classical variable which can be precisely measured during the transition. This requirement is quite restrictive as a linear change will not, in general, be the optimal profile to achieve the desired transition probability. The second simplification allows us to make the substitution :\\\\Delta E = E_2(t) - E_1(t) \\\\equiv \\\\alpha t, \\\\, where \\\\scriptstyle{E_1(t)} and \\\\scriptstyle{E_2(t)} are the energies of the two states at time \\\\scriptstyle{t}, given by the diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian matrix, and \\\\scriptstyle{\\\\alpha} is a constant. For the case of an atom in a magnetic field this corresponds to a linear change in magnetic field. For a linear Zeeman shift this follows directly from point 1. The final simplification requires that the time‚Äìdependent perturbation does not couple the diabatic states; rather, the coupling must be due to a static deviation from a \\\\scriptstyle{1/r} coulomb potential, commonly described by a quantum defect.  Formula  The details of Zener's solution are somewhat opaque, relying on a set of substitutions to put the equation of motion into the form of the Weber equation and using the known solution. A more transparent solution is provided by Curt Wittig using contour integration. The key figure of merit in this approach is the Landau‚ÄìZener velocity: :v_{\\\\rm LZ} = {\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}E_2 - E_1 \\\\over \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial q}E_2 - E_1} \\\\approx \\\\frac{dq}{dt}, where \\\\scriptstyle{q} is the perturbation variable (electric or magnetic field, molecular bond-length, or any other perturbation to the system), and \\\\scriptstyle{E_1} and \\\\scriptstyle{E_2} are the energies of the two diabatic (crossing) states. A large \\\\scriptstyle{v_{\\\\rm LZ}} results in a large diabatic transition probability and vice versa. Using the Landau‚ÄìZener formula the probability, \\\\scriptstyle{P_{\\\\rm D}}, of a diabatic transition is given by :\\\\begin{align} P_{\\\\rm D} &= e^{-2\\\\pi\\\\Gamma}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Gamma &= {a^2/\\\\hbar \\\\over \\\\left\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}(E_2 - E_1)\\\\right} = {a^2/\\\\hbar \\\\over \\\\left\\\\frac{dq}{dt}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial q}(E_2 - E_1)\\\\right}\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= {a^2 \\\\over \\\\hbar\\\\alpha} \\\\end{align} The quantity a is the off-diagonal element of the two-level system's Hamiltonian coupling the bases, and as such it is half the distance between the two unperturbed eigenenergies at the avoided crossing, when E_1 = E_2.  Multistate problem  The simplest generalization of the two-state Landau‚ÄìZener model is a multistate system with the Hamiltonian of the form > H(t)=A+Bt, where A and B are Hermitian NxN matrices with constant elements. The goal of the multistate Landau‚ÄìZener theory is to determine elements of the scattering matrix and transition probabilities between states of this model after evolution with such a Hamiltonian from negative infinite to positive infinite time. Transition probabilities are absolute value squared of scattering matrix elements. There are exact formulas, called hierarchy constraints, that provide analytical expressions for special elements of the scattering matrix in any multi-state Landau‚ÄìZener model. Special cases of these relations are known as the Brundobler‚ÄìElser (BE) formula (noticed by Brundobler and Elser in numerical simulations and rigorously proved by Dobrescu and Sinitsyn, following the contribution of Volkov and Ostrovsky), and the no-go theorem (formulated by Sinitsyn and rigorously proved by Volkov and Ostrovsky). Discrete symmetries also often lead to constraints that reduce the number of independent elements of the scattering matrix. There are specific integrability conditions that, when satisfied, lead to exact expressions for the scattering matrices of multistate Landau‚ÄìZener models. So, numerous completely solvable multistate Landau‚ÄìZener models have been identified and studied, including: * Demkov‚ÄìOsherov model that describes a single level crossing a band of parallel levels. Surprising fact about solution of this model is coincidence of the exactly obtained transition probability matrix with its form obtained by a simple semiclassical independent crossing approximation. With some generalizations, this property appears in almost all solvable Landau‚ÄìZener systems with finite number of interacting states. * Generalized bow-tie model. Model describes coupling of two (or one in the degenerate case limit) levels to a set of otherwise noninteracting diabatic states crossing at a single point. * Driven Tavis‚ÄìCummings model describes interaction of N spins-¬Ω with a bosonic mode in a linearly time-dependent magnetic field. This is the richest known solved system. It has combinatorial complexity: the size of its phase space is growing exponentially with the number of spins N. Transition probabilities in this model are described by q-deformed binomial statistics. * Spin clusters interacting with time- dependent magnetic fields.. This class of models shows relatively complex behavior of transition probabilities due to path interference effects in semiclassical independent crossing approximation. * Reducible (or composite) multistate Landau‚ÄìZener models. This class consists of systems that can be decoupled to subsets of other solvable and simpler models by a symmetry transformation. The notable example is an arbitrary spin Hamiltonian H=gS_x+btS_z, where Sz and Sx are spin operators, and S>1/2; b and g are constant parameters. This is the earliest known solvable system, which was discussed by Majorana in 1932. Among other examples there are models of a pair of degenerate level crossing, and the 1D quantum Ising chain in a linearly changing magnetic field. *Landau‚ÄìZener transitions in infinite linear chains. This class contains systems with formally infinite number of interacting states. Although most known its instances can be obtained as limits of some other models (such as the Tavis‚ÄìCummings model), there are also cases that do not belong to the standard classification of finite size models. For example, there are solvable infinite chains with nonzero couplings between non-nearest states.  Study of noise  Applications of the Landau‚ÄìZener solution to the problems of quantum state preparation and manipulation with discrete degrees of freedom stimulated the study of noise and decoherence effects on the transition probability in a driven two-state system. Several compact analytical results have been derived to describe these effects, including the Kayanuma formula for a strong diagonal noise, and Pokrovsky‚ÄìSinitsyn formula Eq. 42 in for the coupling to a fast colored noise with off-diagonal components. Using Schwinger-Keldysh Green's function, a rather complete and comprehensive study on the effect of quantum noise in all parameter regimes were performed by Ao and Rammer in late 1980s, from weak to strong coupling, low to high temperature, slow to fast passage, etc. Concise analytical expressions were obtained in various limits, showing the rich behaviors of such problem. Table I in The effects of nuclear spin bath and heat bath coupling on the Landau‚ÄìZener process were explored by Sinitsyn and Prokof'ev and Pokrovsky and Sun, respectively. Exact results in multistate Landau‚ÄìZener theory (no-go theorem and BE-formula) can be applied to Landau-Zener systems which are coupled to baths composed of infinite many oscillators and/or spin baths (dissipative Landau-Zener transitions). They provide exact expressions for transition probabilities averaged over final bath states if the evolution begins from the ground state at zero temperature, see in Ref. for oscillator baths and for universal results including spin baths in Ref.

It is apparently extinct throughout the Southern Atoll apart from occasional vagrant birds dispersing from North Keeling, which have been unable to establish viable populations.Reid, Julian R.W.; & Hill, Brydie M (2005). Recent Surveys of the Cocos Buff-banded Rail (Gallirallus philippensis andrewsi). Report to the Australian Government Department of the Environment and Heritage.

(2000). The Action Plan for Australian Birds 2000. Environment Australia: Canberra. Population size is estimated as 850‚Äì1000 individuals, with a population density of 7‚Äì8 individuals/ha. Diet The rails are omnivorous, foraging over the ground throughout the island and the intertidal fringe of the central lagoon for crustaceans, molluscs, insects, worms, seeds, fruits, eggs and carrion, as well as scavenging the refuse of the seabird breeding colonies. Conservation The probable causes of extinction on the islands of the Southern Atoll are habitat clearance and predation by introduced mammals, including feral cats, black rats and humans, as well as competition with junglefowl. Threats to the only remaining breeding population on North Keeling are the introduced yellow crazy ant, the possibility of accidental introduction of terrestrial predators, and the impact of cyclones and tsunamis. North Keeling is entirely contained within the Pulu Keeling National Park, but the island is so small that reintroduction of the rail to one or more of the southern islands, after habitat preparation, is envisaged as a precautionary measure. The Cocos buff-banded rail is classified as endangered under Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. As the only bird taxon endemic to the Territory, the Cocos buff-banded rail has featured frequently on postage stamps issued by the Australian Government for the Cocos (Keeling) Islands.

Katzin. Plot Preacher Jim Killian arrives in a town divided between cattlemen and sheep herders. Killian is not just any preacher, He is a former gunslinger who has set upon a different path. Leelopa, a Native American girl who looks up to Killian, gets raped by one of the cowhands, Coke Beck. Coke is the son of cattle rancher Asa Beck, and when Coke is stabbed to death through the neck, the cattlemen blame Jim. Madge McCloud, the whiskey- drinking madam of the town's saloon and brothel, acts as Jim's conscience. After a gunslinger working for the cattlemen tries to kill Jim, and four cowhands burn the church, he straps on his gun and prepares to act alone. Madge tells him that he must make a decision to be either a gunman or a preacher ‚Äî he must choose between Heaven and Hell, or else he risks the trust of the community. She tells him that trying to be both is a worse sort of Hell. But there is also a pending showdown between the cattlemen and the sheepherders over water rights, and somehow Jim must be in the middle of it, whether armed or not.

As a veteran of many a cattlemen-versus- sheepmen exercise, Mr. Ford plays it cool and, of course, leathery.\\" More recently, film critic Dennis Schwartz gave the film a negative review, writing, \\"...[director] and writer Richard Carr load the genre pic with cliches and violent sequences. The unpleasant Western features a lynching, torture with shears, a rape, arson, a street brawl and your usual saloon gun fights. The numerous cliches include a world-weary gunfighter wanting to reform and to save the world, your typical western fight between cattlemen and sheepherders, an aging saloon keeper and whorehouse madam with a heart of gold (Carolyn Jones) longing for her unavailable old gunfighter friend and a pretty half-caste Indian (Barbara Hershey) finding it difficult to understand the white world.

Subsequently lost, the Risley Park Lanx re-emerged in the 1990s, as a supposed heirloom of the now-notorious art forger Shaun Greenhalgh and his family. Bought by private buyers and donated to the British Museum, it was on display for several years, but was removed when its authenticity became suspect. It was later determined to be a complete fabrication. The fate of the original, genuine, Risley Park Lanx is unknown.\\"The artful codgers: pensioners who conned British museums with ¬£10m forgeries\\". London Evening Standard. 16 November 2007. Original discovery at Risley Park In 1729, a large silver dish was ploughed up at Risley Park, Derbyshire, and broken into pieces soon after its discovery. Lady Aston (Catherine Widdrington 1676-1752 m 1723 Thomas Aston 1655-1725), the owner of Risley Park, was in contact with the pioneer archaeologist William Stukeley about it, though it was some years before he acted. Indeed, there is some doubt as to whether he ever actually saw the lanx himself. However he became sufficiently interested after the discovery of the Corbridge Lanx to have Gerard Vandergucht make line drawings and an engraving of the remaining pieces. Vandergucht certainly saw them, and may well be the \\"one that saw it\\" mentioned in the testament inscribed at the bottom of the engravings: > This print of a curious piece of Antiquity in silver... was defined from all > the fragments of it that could be got together, by one that saw it, before > it was broken in pieces, by the ignorant peoples that found it.Piggot, > Stuart (1985). William Stukeley: an eighteenth-century antiquary. London: > Thames & Hudson. p. 110. Stukeley, at a meeting of the Society of Antiquaries in 1736, read his account, which was later published,Stukeley, William (1736). An account of a large silver plate, of antique basso relievo, Roman workmanship, found in Derbyshire, 1729. Read before the Antiquarian Society of London. complete with a dedication underneath the drawing of the lanx: > To the most noble prince PEREGRINE duke of Anca∆íter and ke∆íteven, Marquis > and Earl of Lind∆íey, Baron Willughby of Ere∆íby, hereditary Lord great > Chamberlain of England, Lord Lieutenant & Custers Rotuleram of the county of > Lincoln &c;, &c;, &c...; Description and origins This lanx, what was left of it, was decorated with pastoral and hunting motifs around the edges, and at the centre was a scene from a boar hunt, similar to the pagan ones on the Mildenhall bowls.Henig, Martin (1996). The Art of Roman Britain. Routledge. p. 167. On one fragment there was also a curious scene of a cherubic figure riding a lion. Like the Corbridge Lanx, the Risley Park one was done in a raised relief style with cast figures. The inscription \\"round the foot at bottom\\" was on the back and reads \\"Exsuperius episcopus ecclesiae Bagiensi dedit\\" (\\"Bishop Exuperius gives this to the church of Bagiensi\\"). This has inspired several different possible theories of the lanx's origin, depending on interpretation of the word \\"Bagiensi\\". Stukeley conjectured that it belonged to Exuperius, the Bishop of Tholouse in 405 AD, who gave it to the Bouge church in Touraine, and that it only ended up in England after it was plundered as spoils of the Battle of Bouge in 1421. However, this turns on his reading of \\"Bagiensi\\" as \\"Bogiensi\\", whereas the Abbe de la Rue's considered choice was Exuperius of Bayeux as a more likely candidate. This Exuperius was the Bishop of Bayeux, and it was suggested that he had gifted the lanx to his own church, before it was plundered by Henry I after he wrested the city from his brother Duke Robert in 1106. A third theory suggests that the lanx was actually cast in Roman Britain by a local pewterer and \\"eventually came into the possession of an important Christian\\", another Exuperius. He gave it to a rural estate called \\"Bogium\\", which was possibly a Roman estate in Derbyshire. Whatever its origins, shortly after its discovery the \\"Risley Park Lanx\\", as it became known, disappeared again. \\"Rediscovery\\" In 1991, the elderly George Greenhalgh came forward with an item resembling the Risley Park Lanx, claiming that he and his family had found the pieces and welded them together. In fact, the piece had been crafted by his son, Shaun, based on an article written by Catherine Johns in 1981,Johns, Catherine. (1981). \\"The Risley Park Silver Lanx: A Lost Antiquity from Roman Britain\\". Antiquaries Journal Vol 61, Issue 1. pp. 53-72. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003581500029012 and Stukeley's 1736 account. George also presented a forged will that apparently bequeathed the Risley Park Lanx to his family.Flynn, Tom (Summer 2007). \\"Faking It\\" . Art Quarterly. Retrieved on 23 November 2007. The British Museum was unconvinced that this was the original lanx, but nevertheless considered it probable that it was a genuine period replica. The original had been fragile, therefore it was feasible that \\"moulds of the pieces were taken and copies cast\\". No suspicions were raised by the fact that the pieces did not match the arrangement in the Stukeley engraving ‚Äì itself a mere guess by Vandergucht, who had less than half of the lanx to work with. They could have reasonably been the remaining original pieces put together differently at a later date. Furthermore, the Greenhalghs had cleverly invested in some actual Roman silver coins, which they melted down to create the lanx.Middleton, Andrew; Lang, Janet (2005). Radiography of Cultural Material (2nd ed.). Elsevier. p. 181. This complicated the matter of authenticity. Radiographic analysis also showed that different era solders had been used, suggesting it had been recast in the eighteenth or nineteenth century, perhaps using fragments of the original.Chadwick, Edward (17 November 2007). \\"Antiques rogues show: update 3\\".

BBC News. Retrieved on 17 November 2007. When \\"two wealthy Americans\\" gifted the lanx to the British Museum in honour of David Wilson, outgoing director of the Museum, it was placed on display as a replica. It remained there until the rising publicity over the Greenhalghs forced its withdrawal for reassessment. However, even after the Greenhalghs were exposed as forgers, the Museum remained ambivalent about the worth of their lanx.

He was born in Cauquenes, the son of Napole√≥n Trucco Morano and of Mar√≠a Franzani Monigette. He completed his studies in his native city, and at the Instituto Nacional. Trucco then attended the Universidad de Chile, where he became a civil engineer in 1899. Between 1891 and 1902, while still a student at the university, he started to work at the Liceo de Cauquenes to complement his income, first as the secretary to the principal and then as a teacher of mathematics. After his graduation he became an engineer at the Direction of Public Works and at the State Railroads. The government granted him a scholarship to complete his graduate studies at L‚ÄôEcole des Ponts et Chauss√©es in Par√≠s between 1902 and 1904. He married Laura Gaete Fagalde, and together they had four children: Marta, Graciela, Rebeca and Manuel. At his return, he became a Professor of the resistance of materials at the school of architecture of the Universidad de Chile, while continuing his work at the State Railroads, where he designed several railroad bridges (such as the Claro, near Yumbel, the Perquilauqu√©n near Quella, and the viaduct of Las Cucharas in the Santiago-Valpara√≠so track.) In 1911 he became Dean of Mathematics at the university, and in 1917, also became director of the schools of engineering and architecture. In 1918, Trucco resigned all his positions at the university in order to dedicate himself to his work as General Director of Railroads, a position he held until 1924. Trucco joined the Radical Party and in 1926 became its president, but resigned shortly afterwards due to his poor health. The same year he was elected Senator for \\"Arauco, Malleco and Caut√≠n\\" (1926-1930). After the resignation of president Carlos Ib√°√±ez del Campo in 1931, his successor, vice-President Juan Esteban Montero named Trucco as Minister of the Interior on August 7, 1931. Very soon after, Montero accepted the presidential nomination for the upcoming elections. Since Montero was constitutionally banned from standing as a candidate while still in office, as a way out of the political impasse, and in order to qualify, he resigned his vice-presidency effective on August 20, 1931. The position was assumed by Manuel Trucco as Vice President. The Trucco administration was only a caretaker one, charged with keeping order in the country until after the presidential elections. Nonetheless it was faced with very difficult moments such as the Sailors' mutiny in the navy, caused by the reduction of the salaries of the enlisted men (September 1‚Äì5, 1931), which was controlled only after an aerial bombing of the fleet, but which predicted difficult times ahead. He remained as Vice President until November 15, when Juan Esteban Montero resumed power after sweeping the election. President Arturo Alessandri named him ambassador to the United States between 1932 and 1938. At his return, Trucco retired from politics, but in 1946, President Gabriel Gonz√°lez Videla appointed him President of the Central Bank of Chile, a position he held until 1951. Manuel Trucco died in Santiago in 1954 at the age of 79.

History Urbana High School's current building was built in 1914. It was designed by architect Joseph Royer who also designed many other buildings in the area including the Urbana Free Library and the Champaign County Court House. The architecture of Urbana High School is of the Tudor style, defined primarily by the towers over the main entrance and the flattened point arches over the doors. An addition was built in 1916 which included a gymnasium and swimming pool. Due to increasing enrollment, further additions were built in 1955 and 1965. In 1988, an enclosed athletic area was added while the old gymnasium/pool wing was converted into classrooms. The entire building was also renovated to meet safety codes. During the renovation, areas that had been sealed off during previous construction revealed graffiti dating back to around the 1950s. The Urbana Park District Indoor Aquatic Center was built in 2003. Being adjoined to Urbana High School, it brings the building to its current state. Beginning in 2011, the Urbana School District (USD) #116 began construction on several projects to update the older facilities.

It first appeared as a central component of macroeconomic theory as it was taught by Paul Samuelson in his textbook, Economics: An Introductory Analysis. The Keynesian Cross plots aggregate income (labelled as Y on the horizontal axis) and planned total spending or aggregate expenditure (labelled as AD on the vertical axis). Overview In the Keynesian cross diagram, the upward sloping blue line represents the aggregate expenditure for goods and services by all households and firms as a function of their income. The 45-degree line represents an aggregate supply curve which embodies the idea that, as long as the economy is operating at less than full employment, anything demanded will be supplied. Aggregate expenditure and aggregate income are measured by dividing the money value of all goods produced in the economy in a given year by a price index. The resulting construct is referred to as Real Gross Domestic Product. The sum of all incomes earned in the economy in a given period of time is identically equal to the sum of all expenditures, an identity resulting from the circular flow of income. But not all expenditures are planned. For example, if an automobile plant produces 1,000 cars, but not all of them are sold, the unsold cars are labelled as inventory investment in the GDP accounts. The income earned by the people who produced those cars is part of aggregate income and the value of all of the cars produced is part of total expenditure. But only the value of the cars that are sold is part of planned aggregate expenditure. In the diagram, the equilibrium level of income and expenditure is determined where the aggregate demand curve intersects the 45-degree line. At this point there is no unintended accumulation of inventories. The equilibrium point is labelled as _Y'_. Under standard assumptions about the determinants of aggregate expenditure, the AD curve is flatter than the 45-degree line and the equilibrium level of income, _Y'_ , is stable. If income is less than _Y'_ , aggregate expenditure exceeds aggregate income and firms will find that their inventories are falling. They will hire more workers, and incomes will increase causing a movement back towards _Y'_. Conversely, if income is greater than _Y'_ , aggregate expenditure is less than aggregate income and firms will find that inventories are increasing. They will fire workers, and incomes will fall. _Y'_ is the only level of income at which there is no desire on the part of firms to change the number of people they employ. Aggregate employment is determined by the demand for labor as firms hire or fire workers to recruit enough labor to produce the goods demanded to meet aggregate expenditure. In Keynesian economic theory, equilibrium is typically assumed to occur at less than full employment, an assumption that is justified by appealing to the empirical connection between employment and output known as Okun's law. Aggregate expenditure can be broken down into four component parts. These consist of consumption expenditure _C_ , planned investment expenditure, _I_ p, government expenditure on goods and services, _G_ and exports net of imports, _NX_. In the simplest exposition of Keynesian theory, the economy is assumed to be closed (which implies that _NX_ = 0), and planned investment is exogenous and determined by the animal spirits of investors. Consumption is an affine function of income, _C = a + bY_ where the slope coefficient _b_ is called the marginal propensity to consume. If any of the components of aggregate demand, _a, I_ p or _G_ rises, for a given level of income, _Y_ , the aggregate demand curve shifts up and the intersection of the AD curve with the 45-degree line shifts right. Similarly, if any of these three components falls, the AD curve shifts down and the intersection of the AD curve with the 45-degree line shifts left. In the General Theory, Keynes explained the Great Depression as a downward shift of the AD curve caused by a loss of business confidence and a collapse in planned investment. http://www.rogerfarmer.com/rogerfarmerblog/2014/02/a-quiz-for-wannabe- keynesians.html?rq=keynesian%20cross My Quiz for Wannabee Keynesians . Original formulation The Keynesian cross is a simplification of the ideas contained in the first four chapters of the General Theory. It differs in several significant ways from the original formulation. In its original formulation, Keynes envisaged a pair of functions that he referred to as an aggregate demand and an aggregate supply function. But unlike the formulation in Samuelson's textbook, these were not relationships between real aggregate expenditure and real aggregate income. They were envisaged as relationships connecting GDP and the volume of employment. Keynes devoted an entire chapter of the General Theory, chapter 4, to the choice of units. In the book, he uses only two units: money units and labor hours. GDP can be unambiguously measured in monetary units such as dollars or Euros, but we cannot add up tons of steel and kilos of oranges. Keynes acknowledged that labor is not homogenous, but he proposed to solve that problem by arguing that if a brain surgeon is paid ten times more than a garbage collector then the brain surgeon is supplying ten times as many effective units of labor. This construction leads to an alternative formulation of the measurement of GDP that can be constructed by dividing the dollar value of all the goods and services produced in a given year by a measure of the money wage. In the original formulation of Keynesian economics in the General Theory, Keynes abandoned the classical concept that the demand and supply of labor are always equal and instead, he simply dropped the labor supply curve from his analysis. The failure of Keynes to provide an alternative micro-foundation to his theory led to widespread disagreement about the intellectual foundations of Keynesian Economics. Assumptions The Keynesian cross produces an equilibrium under several assumptions. First, the AD (blue) curve is positive. The AD curve is assumed to be positive because an increase in national output should lead to an increase in disposable income and, thus, an increase in consumption, which makes up a portion of aggregate demand.Suranovic, Steven M. \\"Chapter 50-7: The Keynesian Cross Diagram.\\" International Finance Theory and Policy. Last Updated on 1/20/05 http://internationalecon.com/Finance/Fch50/F50-7.php Second, the AD curve is assumed to have a positive, vertical intercept. The AD curve must have a positive, vertical intercept to cross the AD=Y curve. If the curves do not cross, there is no equilibrium and no equilibrium output can be determined. The AD curve will have a positive, vertical intercept as long as there is some aggregated demand‚Äîfrom consumer spending, investment, net exports, or government spending‚Äîeven if there is no national output. The slope of the AD curve is steeper given a high multiplier value.

There are no shops in the suburb but there a small set of shops providing basic services on the corner of Chermside Road and Jacaranda Street in East Ipswich just beyond the south-eastern boundary of Basin Pocket. History The origin of the suburb name is derived from \\"The Basin\\", an enlarged natural widening used by river steamers to turn before or after berthing at Ipswich, to which the suburb is adjacent. The explorer Allan Cunningham noted the Basin in 1828, and the Rev. Dr John Dunmore Lang suggested that Basin Pocket or Booval might have been a better site for the main settlement. A ferry service between Basin Pocket and North Ipswich was established by William Isaac Lawrence sometime after his family settled there in the 1860s. (This service does not exist today). St John's Anglican Church was opened on 3 September 1921 by Canon T. L. H. Jenkyn, the rector of St Paul's Anglican Church in Ipswich. It was dedicated on 11 September 1921 by Archbishop Gerald Sharp. Its closure circa 2018 was approved by Bishop Cameron Venables. The church was at 82 Blackall Street ().

In the , Tivoli had a population of 1,487 people. Tivoli is home to one of six remaining drive-in cinemas in Queensland. Geography The Warrego Highway passes from east (North Tivoli) to west (North Ipswich) through the north of the locality. Tivoli Hill is a neighbourhood with the suburb (). Prior to 1991 it was a separate suburb. The neighbourhood is near the hill of the same name(). Situated north of the Bremer River, Tivoli is by road north-east of the Ipswich CBD and north-east of the North Ipswich railway workshops. History The Tivoli area had been subdivided and sold as farmland in 1861‚Äì63, and the observant purchasers went in for coal mining. Harry Hooper and his partner John Robinson called their mine, and one of the coal seams on it, the Tivoli, and the locality took its name from the mine. Houses and communities formed around the irregular subdivisions and mining areas. On 9 September 1873 a Congregational church opened near the Tivoli mine . The church at 42 Church Street () has had continuous use. It is currently the Tivoli Christian Reformed Church. The church hall was used as a school room for children and adults (night classes) from 1 July 1875. It had over 100 pupils by 1877 and opened as Tivoli Provisional School on 26 Jan 1877. On on 17 January 1881 it became Tivoli State School. In 1937 it was renamed Tivoli Lower State School but in 1977 was renamed Tivoli State School again. Whilst many houses were built for workmen, mine owners built close to their work sites. Next to the school in Mount Crosby Road the family of John Wright, proprietor of the Eclipse mine, built three houses on large allotments. The grandest, Oaklands is the central one; all have spacious gardens and are listed on the Queensland Heritage Register. On the other side of Mount Crosby Road, the Abermain Colliery (1880s) was a large operation with a spur line from the Tivoli railway line and several coke ovens. In another direction, a tramway was opened from the Tivoli mines to the pumping station at the Mount Crosby weir, transporting coal from 1913 until about 1932. After lying idle for several years the Abermain Colliery was used for sewerage treatment. It adjoins a sports complex and the Ipswich Caravan Village. A short distance south there is the Abermain electricity substation which was enlarged in 2009. Financed and named by John Robinson (Ipswich soda-water manufacturer) and Harry Hooper, it seems that Tivoli was a Hooper family name. In the , Tivoli had a population of 1,487 people.

The suburb consists of residential and industrial areas, with a variety of shops lining Brisbane Rd. History The origin of the suburb name is from the Yugarabul Aboriginal language meaning place of the stone axe. It was initially written as Bundumba, then Bundanba, and then on 30 January 1932, the name was officially standardised as Bundamba. Bundamba State School opened on 5 February 1873. In December 1895 the Anglican Diocese's architect John Buckeridge called for tenders to erect the Church of All Saints in Bundanba on land donated by Miss Ferrett and Mr Harry Ferrett. Bishop William Webber laid the foundation stone on Friday 24 January 1896. Bishop Webber opened and dedicated the new church on Saturday 16 May 1896. In April 1897 Harry Ferrett was married in the church. In 1913 the church building was moved by rolling it on beer barrels to Silkstone. In 1930 it was moved again on a flat-top lorry to its current location in Booval. A new church hall for All Saints' Anglican Church was opened in Booval on Sunday 10 May 1930.

She was the second wife of Emperor Zhongzong, who reigned twice, and during his second reign, she tried to emulate the example of her mother-in-law Wu Zetian and seize power. She was in charge of government affairs during her husband's reign. After Emperor Zhongzong's death in 710‚Äîa death traditionally believed to be a poisoning she carried out together with her daughter Li Guo'er the Princess Anle‚Äîwhich gave her the power to become the empress dowager and regent, but in short order was overthrown and killed in a coup led by Emperor Zhongzong's nephew Li Longji (the later Emperor Xuanzong) and Emperor Zhongzong's sister Princess Taiping. First stint as crown princess It is not known when Empress Wei was born. During the reign of her husband's grandfather Emperor Taizong, her grandfather Wei Hongbiao (ÈüãÂºòË°®) served as the military advisor to Emperor Taizong's son Li Ming (ÊùéÊòé) the Prince of Cao. When Emperor Zhongzong, then using the name Li Zhe, was crown prince, he married her as his second wife (his first wife, Princess Zhao, was starved to death when her mother Princess Changle offended Li Zhe's mother Empress Wu (later known as Wu Zetian)) and crown princess.As Li Zhe became crown prince in 680, and their son Li Chongrun was born in 682, the marriage must have taken place in either 680 or 681. At the time that they were married, Li Zhe's father Emperor Gaozong promoted her father Wei Xuanzhen (ÈüãÁéÑË≤û) from being the military advisor to the prefect of Pu Prefecture (ÊôÆÂ∑û, roughly modern Ziyang, Sichuan) (eighth rank, second class, second division) to be the much more important post of being prefect of Yu Prefecture (Ë±´Â∑û, roughly modern Zhumadian, Henan) (fourth rank, first class, second division).This is per the Old Book of Tang, vol. 51. However, according to the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 203, this promotion took place after Li Zhe took the throne as emperor in 684. In 682, she gave birth to their only son, Li Chongzhao. Sometime during her stint as crown princess, she also gave birth to at least one daughter (the later Princess Changning) and possibly another (Li Xianhui, the later Princess Yongtai). First stint as empress Emperor Gaozong died in late 683, and Li Zhe took the throne (historically known as Emperor Zhongzong). However, actual power was in the hands of his mother Empress Wu, now empress dowager. In spring 684, Emperor Zhongzong made Crown Princess Wei the empress. He soon wanted to promote Wei Xuanzhen to be Shizhong (‰æç‰∏≠), the head of the examination bureau of government (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng) and a post considered one for a chancellor. This move, as well as another wish of his‚Äîto make the son of his wet nurse an official of the fifth rank‚Äîwere opposed by the chancellor Pei Yan. As they argued, Emperor Zhongzong, in anger, remarked: Pei, in fear, informed this to Empress Dowager Wu. Just less than two months after Emperor Zhongzong had taken the throne, Empress Dowager Wu summoned the officials and generals and issued an edict deposing Emperor Zhongzong and reducing to the title of Prince of Luling. She instead created his younger brother Li Dan the Prince of Yu emperor (historically known as Emperor Ruizong). Li Chongzhao, who had been given the title of Deputy Crown Prince by Emperor Gaozong, was reduced to commoner rank and Wei Xuanzhen, along with his family, were exiled to Qin Prefecture (Ê¨ΩÂ∑û, roughly modern Qinzhou, Guangxi). Empress Dowager Wu soon ordered that Li Zhe and his family first be delivered to Fang Prefecture (ÊàøÂ∑û, in modern Shiyan, Hubei), and then Jun Prefecture (ÂùáÂ∑û, also in modern Shiyan), to be held under house arrest at the house that his uncle Li Tai had been placed after Li Tai was deposed in 643. In exile Li Zhe was constantly in fear in exile, as Empress Dowager Wu had previously shown willingness to kill her own children‚Äîhaving forced his older brother Li Xi√°n to commit suicide in 684 and having been rumored to have poisoned another older brother, Li Hong, in 675‚Äîand whenever there would be imperial messengers arriving from then-capital Luoyang, he would consider committing suicide, fearing that they brought orders for even worse fates. Princess Wei would repeatedly tell him: At this point, they were deeply in love with each other, and at another point, he told her: While they in exile, she gave birth to their youngest daughter, Li Guo'er‚Äîwhose name Guo'er meant, \\"child who was wrapped\\" and referred to how, when she was born, Li Zhe was required to take off his shirt and wrap her in the shirt. Li Zhe and Princess Wei both greatly favored this child born in distress. Meanwhile, while Li Zhe and Princess Wei were in exile, so were Wei Xuanzhen and his family. After Wei Xuanzhen died soon thereafter, a local tribal chief, Ning Chengji (ÂØßÊâøÂü∫), demanded to marry Princess Wei's younger sister. When Princess Wei's mother Lady Cui refused, Ning killed her and her four sons Wei Xun (ÈüãÊ¥µ), Wei Hao (ÈüãÊµ©), Wei Dong (ÈüãÊ¥û), and Wei Ci (ÈüãÊ≥ö). While Li Zhe and Princess Wei were in exile, Empress Dowager Wu had, in 690, forced Li Zhe's brother Li Dan to yield the throne to her, interrupting Tang Dynasty and establishing her own Zhou Dynasty with her as \\"emperor\\" (thereafter known as Wu Zetian). She created the now-removed Li Dan as her crown prince, but constantly suspected him of secretly plotting against her, and in 693, she killed his wife Crown Princess Liu and concubine Consort Dou, and further investigated him for treason, stopping the investigation only when his servant, An Jinzang, cut open his own belly to swear that Li Dan would never commit treason. She nevertheless repeatedly considered replacing him with her nephews Wu Chengsi the Prince of Wei and Wu Sansi the Prince of Liang. By 698, however, the chancellor Di Renjie had convinced Wu Zetian that it was to her sons, not her nephews, that she should turn for support. Di's fellow chancellors Wang Fangqing and Wang Jishan, as well as Wu Zetian's lovers Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong and her confidant Ji Xu also supported the idea of summoning Li Zhe from exile. In spring 698, Wu Zetian summoned Li Zhe and his family back to Luoyang. Second stint as crown princess Once Li Zhe was back in Luoyang, Li Dan offered to yield the crown prince position to his older brother, and Wu Zetian agreed. In fall 698, she created Li Zhe crown prince and had him change his name back to the original name Li Xi«én (note different tone than his brother) (although she soon also had him change his surname to her surname Wu‚Äîthus making him Wu Xi«én). Princess Wei again became crown princess. Her son Li Chongzhao‚Äîwho had by now changed his name to Li Chongrun to observe naming taboo for Wu Zetian's personal name Zhao‚Äîwas created the Prince of Shao. There are many glorious state paintings of this in the forbidden city. Meanwhile, Wu Zetian, in her old age, had entrusted much of the affairs of state to Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong‚Äîsomething that Li Chongrun discussed with his sister Li Xianhui and her husband, Wu Zetian's grandnephew Wu Yanji (Ê≠¶Âª∂Âü∫) the Prince of Wei (Wu Chengsi's son) at times. Zhang Yizhi found out and informed Wu Zetian. Wu Zetian, believing that she was being criticized, in fall 701, ordered Li Chongrun, Li Xianhui, and Wu Yanji to commit suicide.However, some modern historians, based on the text on Li Xianhui's tombstone (written after Emperor Zhongzong was restored to the throne in 705), which suggested that she died the day after her brother and her husband and that she was pregnant at death, and the fact that the skeleton believed to be hers had a small pelvis, have proposed the theory that she was not ordered to commit suicide, but had, in grief over her brother's and husband's deaths, had either a miscarriage or a difficult birth and died from that. See, e.g., illustrations preceding the Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 49. It may be notable that the Chinese Wikipedia article for Li Xianhui gave the text for her tombstone, but did not give an external link corroborating the text in the article. Li Chongrun's death would leave Crown Princess Wei without a son, as his other sons Li Chongfu, Li Chongjun, and Li Chongmao were all born of concubines. In spring 705, with Wu Zetian being ill, the officials Zhang Jianzhi, Cui Xuanwei, Jing Hui, Huan Yanfan, and Yuan Shuji initiated a coup and killed Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong. They forced Wu Zetian to yield the throne back to Wu Xi«én, and he returned to the throne, restoring Tang Dynasty. He created Crown Princess Wei empress again. He also posthumously honored her father Wei Xuanzhen as the Prince of Shangluo and her mother Lady Cui as the Princess of Shangluo, reburying them in grand ceremonies. In addition, he posthumously honored Li Chongrun as Crown Prince Yide and Li Xianhui as Princess Yongtai, reburying them with ceremonies due emperors. Second stint as empress After the reappearance of the emperor Zhongzong, Empress Wei regained power and quickly became very powerful. Zhang Jianzhi and his colleagues next wanted to suppress the power of that the Wu clan princes had, but at this time, Emperor Zhongzong's concubine Consort Shangguan Wan'er, who had been Wu Zetian's secretary and who had carried on an affair with Wu Zetian's nephew Wu Sansi, helped kindle an affair between Wu Sansi and Empress Wei as well. (Emperor Zhongzong was either unaware of, or implicitly approved of, the affair.) Wu Sansi became a trusted advisor of Emperor Zhongzong. Meanwhile, Empress Wei disliked her husband's son Li Chongfu the Prince of Qiao (whose wife was Zhang's niece), and falsely accused him of being implicit in Li Chongrun's death; Emperor Zhongzong responded by exiling Li Chongfu to Jun Prefecture to serve as prefect. It was said that both Empress Wei and her daughter Li Guo'er (now with the title Princess Anle and who married Wu Sansi's son Wu Chongxun (Ê≠¶Â¥áË®ì)) were very powerful and corrupt, offering offices for sale and influencing legal decisions. it was even said that Li Guo'er often wrote edicts in Emperor Zhongzong's name, and then covered up the contents and had him sign them‚Äîand that he would do so despite not reading the edicts. She also requested to be made his heir, as crown princess‚Äîwhich would be an unprecedented act in Chinese history, although he declined and created her brother Li Chongjun crown prince instead. Wu Sansi and Empress Wei, who despised Zhang and his colleagues, accused them of being overly arrogant in light of their achievements, and at Wu Sansi's suggestion, Emperor Zhongzong made Zhang, Jing Hui, Huan Yanfan, Yuan Shuji, and Cui Xuanwei princes, ostensibly to honor them, but instead intending to remove them from positions of power. (Emperor Zhongzong, for reasons unclear, also bestowed the surname of Wei on Huan, \\"honoring\\" him by merging his clan with Empress Wei's.) Soon, the five princes were made prefectural prefects and sent out of Luoyang. In spring 706, after Emperor Zhongzong's son-in-law Wang Tongjiao (ÁéãÂêåÁöé), who despised Empress Wei and Wu Sansi, was accused of plotting to kill them, Empress Wei and Wu Sansi took this opportunity to implicate Jing, Cui, Huan (whose Wei surname was then stripped), Yuan, and Zhang, of being involved in the plot, and had them further reduced to be prefectural military advisors in distant prefects. Wu Sansi then intentionally inflamed Emperor Zhongzong by having people publicly accuse Empress Wei of adultery and then accusing the five princes of this. Emperor Zhongzong responded by ordering the five of them permanently exiled; Wu then sent the official Zhou Lizhen (Âë®Âà©Ë≤û) to have the five of them killed cruelly (although Zhang and Cui were already dead by the time that Zhou reached them). Meanwhile, to avenge her mother's and brothers' deaths, Empress Wei had Emperor Zhongzong order Zhou Rengui (Âë®‰ªÅËªå), the commandant at Guang Prefecture (Âª£Â∑û, roughly modern Guangzhou, Guangdong), to attack Ning Chengji and his brothers; Zhou defeated Ning and slaughtered his people. In gratitude, Empress Wei bowed to Zhou, honoring him like a father, and Emperor Zhongzong created Zhou the Duke of Ru'nan. Despite Li Chongjun's status as crown prince, Li Guo'er and her husband Wu Chongxun often humiliated and harassed him, sometimes referring to him as a slave. Further, Li Guo'er was continuing to try to persuade Emperor Zhongzong to depose Li Chongjun and create her crown princess instead. Li Chongjun finally erupted in anger in fall 707, rising with the ethnically Mohe general Li Duozuo and Emperor Zhongzong's cousin Li Qianli (ÊùéÂçÉÈáå) the Prince of Cheng. Li Chongjun's forces killed Wu Sansi and Wu Chengxu, and next headed to the palace, hoping to capture Consort Shangguan and Empress Wei. However, after Li Duozuo's son-in-law Ye Huli (ÈáéÂëºÂà©) was killed by the eunuch guard commander Yang Sixu (Ê•äÊÄùÂãó), Li Chongjun's army collapsed, and he was soon killed by his own subordinates. (Li Guo'er soon married Wu Chengxun's cousin Wu Yanxiu (Ê≠¶Âª∂ÁßÄ).) It was said by 708, Empress Wei, Li Guo'er, Empress Wei's other daughter Princess Changning, Consort Shangguan, Empress Wei's sister Lady of Cheng, Consort Shangguan's mother Lady Zheng, along with senior ladies in waiting Ladies Chai and Helou, the sorceress Diwu Ying'er (Á¨¨‰∫îËã±ÂÖí), and Lady Zhao of Longxi, were all powerful and corrupt, selling offices at will. They, along with Emperor Zhongzong's sister Princess Taiping, were often involved in partisan struggles, a phenomenon that Emperor Zhongzong was concerned about, but could do little to curb. Empress Wei's power was such that around the new year 709, when Emperor Zhongzong offered to have her old wet nurse Lady Wang marry the widower chancellor Dou Chongyi, Dou, seeing the opportunity for even more power, gleefully agreed notwithstanding Lady Wang's otherwise low status. Meanwhile, Empress Wei and the Princesses Changning and Anle were also building many Buddhist temples. By fall 710, it was said that Empress Wei had been having affairs with the officials Ma Qinke (È¶¨Áß¶ÂÆ¢) and Yang Jun (Ê•äÂùá), and Ma and Yang were concerned that if the affairs became known they would be killed. Meanwhile, Li Guo'er hoped that if Empress Wei became the sovereign she would be crown princess. They conspired to poison a cake, and after Emperor Zhongzong ate the cake, he died, on July 3, 710.ÂÖ©ÂçÉÂπ¥‰∏≠Ë•øÊõÜËΩâÊèõ Empress Wei did not initially announce his death, but instead a number of her cousins in charge of the imperial guards, to secure power, before she announced Emperor Zhongzong's death two days after his death. By an edict that Princess Taiping and Consort Shangguan drafted (and later revised by Empress Wei's cousin Wei Wen), Emperor Zhongzong's son Li Chongmao the Prince of Wen was created crown prince, and Li Chongmao then took the throne (as Emperor Shang) on July 8. Empress Wei retained power as empress dowager. As empress dowager and regent Meanwhile, Empress Dowager Wei's clan members, along with the chancellor Zong Chuke, Wu Yanxiu, and other officials Zhao L√ºwen (Ë∂ôÂ±•Ê∫´) and Ye Jingneng (ËëâÈùúËÉΩ) were advising her to take the throne, like Wu Zetian did, and they also advised her to eliminate Li Dan and Princess Taiping. The official Cui Riyong leaked their plan to Li Dan's son Li Longji the Prince of Linzi. Li Longji responded by conspiring with Princess Taiping, Princess Taiping's son Xue Chongjian (ËñõÂ¥áÁ∞°), as well as several low level officials close to him‚ÄîZhong Shaojing, Wang Chongye (ÁéãÂ¥áÊõÑ), Liu Youqiu, and Ma Sizong (È∫ªÂó£ÂÆó)‚Äîto act first. Meanwhile, Empress Wei's nephews Wei Bo (ÈüãÊí≠) and Gao Song (È´òÂµ©), who had recently been put in command of imperial guards and who had tried to establish their authority by dealing with the guards harshly, had alienated the guards, and the guard officers Ge Fushun (ËëõÁ¶èÈ†Ü), Chen Xuanli (Èô≥ÁéÑÁ¶Æ), and Li Xianfu (Êùé‰ªôÈ≥ß) thereafter also joined the plot. Without first informing Li Dan, the conspirators rose on July 21, first killing Wei Bo, Gao, and Empress Wei's cousin Wei Xuan (ÈüãÁíø). They then attacked the palace. When Empress Dowager Wei panicked and fled to an imperial guard camp, a guard beheaded her. Li Guo'er, Wu Yanxiu, and Lady Helou were killed as well. Li Longji soon slaughtered a number of officials in Empress Dowager's faction as well as her clan, while displaying Empress Dowager Wei's body on the street. At the urging of Princess Taiping, Li Longji, and Li Longji's brother Li Chengqi, Li Dan soon took the throne from Li Chongmao and again became emperor (as Emperor Ruizong). Empress Dowager Wei was posthumously reduced to commoner rank. Emperor Ruizong still buried her with honors (so some historians refer this as an evidence that she never poisoned Zhongzong), but not with honors due an empress, rather with honors due an official of the first rank.

The Lower Georges Heights Commanding Position was constructed and designed to stop enemy ships from entering into Sydney Harbour, and worked in conjunction with several others forts located within close proximity. History The fortification was built in 1877 and became part of the Sydney Harbours outer defences. At the time this method of fortification was considered to be the most efficient way of defending this entry point into Sydney Harbour.http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:MiddleGeorgeshedfort0195.JPG The two cannons that were first placed at the site were RML 9 inch 12 ton guns. Rifled Muzzle Loaders (RMLs) are artillery pieces loaded from the muzzle, but with a rifled bore liner, invented in the mid-19th century. In contrast to smooth bore cannon which preceded it, the rifling of the gun barrel allowed much greater accuracy and penetration as the spin induced to the shell gave it directional stability. Initially smooth-bore cannon were converted into rifles by re-boring and lining; but later new guns were manufactured from scratch as RMLs. The RML 9 inch 12 ton gun could discharge shells weighing 249 pounds (113 kg) as far as South Head (Watsons Bay); approximately 3,000 yards (2,770 metres). As technology improved, these cannons were replaced in 1889 by much lighter weight guns that could fire an 80-pound (36 kg) projectile for 3,170 yards (3,000 metres). From 1903 to 1907 the fortifications were upgraded to allow for the installation of two BL 6 inch Mark 7 guns that were ‚Äúbreech loading‚Äù which meant that the explosive charge and projectile were to be loaded into the rear of the cannon. They could fire a 100-pound (45.4 kg) shell a long way out to sea; up to 14,000 yards (12,900 metres). The underground rooms of the fortifications were used to store ammunition and charges which were brought along Military Road, giving the road its name.

He married Zainab un-nisa Begum and Azmat un-nisa Begum, the daughters of Murshid Quli Khan by Nasiri Banu Begum. Shuja-ud-Din's third wife was Durdana Begum Sahiba. After the death of his father-in-law on 30 June 1727, he ascended to the Masnad (throne) of the Nawab. Early life Born at Burhanpur, Deccan, as Mirza Shuja ud-din Muhammad Khan (Mirza Deccani), son of Nawab Jan Muhammad Khan (Mirza Nur ud-din Muhammad), he was appointed Subahdar (Provincial governor) of Odisha in 1719. He was also appointed as the Subahdar of Bengal in July 1727 and Subahdar of Bihar in 1731. The title of Subahdar was bestowed by the Mughal Emperor of Delhi. Rise to power In absence of a direct heir, Murshid Quli Khan nominated his grandson Sarfaraz Khan to the Masnad. Murshid Quli Khan died in 1727 and Sarfaraz Khan was to ascend to the Masnad. Then, Shuja ud-din was the Subahdar of Odisha with Alivardi Khan as his Naib (Deputy). Murshid Quli was not generally pleased of the inclusive and people friendly policies of Shuja ud-Din. Accordingly, when Sarfaraz Khan was announced heir, Shuja ud-Din was disturbed at the idea of being in the employment of his son. Alivardi Khan and his brother Haji Ahmed convinced Shuja ud-Din that he himself was more suitable for this position. With support from Alivardi and Haji he made preparations for a take over. He received support from Mughal Emperor, Muhammad Shah in Delhi, who was ready to help him. Shuja ud-Din marched at the head of a large army towards Murshidabad, the capital of the Nawabs of Bengal. To avoid a conflict in the family, the dowager Begum of Murshid Quli Khan intervened; and her son-in-law Shuja-ud-Din ascended to the Masnad of Bengal after Sarfaraz Kahn abidicated in favour of his father. By August 1727, Shuja-ud-Din was firmly established and recognised as the second Nawab of Bengal. As a sign of gratitude for supporting him, he sent a huge amount of money from his revenue collection to the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah and in return the Mughals recognised him as Motamul ul-Mulk (Guardian of the country), Shuja ud-Daula (Hero of the state) and Asad Jang (Lion in War), establishing diplomatic ties. He also received the personal Mansab of a Haft Hazari, with seven thousand troopers, besides a fringed Palki (palanquin), together with the insignia of the Mahi Order, and a Khilat consisting of six pieces of robes, precious stones, a jewel-mounted sword, and a royal elephant with a horse. Reign Shuja ud-Din was known to be brave, liberal and generous. The only factor that went against him in terms of having a long rule, was his age. Administration The Siyar-ul-Mutakherin mentions that with regard to private disputes between man and man, he trusted no one ; but sending for the parties, he would listen patiently and leisurely to the story of each, and with much judgment drew his conclusion, and pronouncing the decree, caused it to be executed with punctuality. Constantly animated by a scrupulous regard for justice, and always inspired by fear of God, he uprooted from his realm the foundations of oppressions and tyrannies. Shuja detested the high handed policies of Murshid Quli Khan and had them reversed (in totality) immediately. His detest was so extreme that he went to the extent of auctioning the household goods of Murshid Quli Khan to his arch enemies, the Hindu Zamindars. By this act he raised four million rupees. He had Nazir Ahmad and Murad Farrash, the employees of Murshid Quli Khan, who were notorious for their highhandedness, executed and confiscated their effects. He tore down most of the buildings constructed by Murshid Quli and had newer and bigger constructions done in their place. He allowed the growth and prosperity of his subordinates who respected and gave him fullest loyal services in return. Unlike Murshid Quli, he was not feared and never extracted loyalty but rather commanded the same. Re-alignment of administrative districts In 1733, he merged Bihar Subah with Bengal and divided the merged territory into four administrative divisions, and made the following changes in the administrative positions: ::1. Elder son, Sarfaraz Khan: Nazim (Dewan) of the Subah of Bengal ::2. Younger son, Muhammad Taqi : Naib (Deputy) Subahdar of Odisha ::3. Younger son-in-law, Mirza Lutfullah: Naib (Deputy) Nazim of Dacca ::4. Haji Ahmed (brother of Alivardi Khan): Chief Counsellor ::5. Nawazish Muhammad Khan: Mir Bakshi (Paymaster General) ::6. Syed Ahmed Khan: Faujdar of Rangpur ::7. Zain ud-Deen Ahmed Khan: Faujdar of Rajmahal (Akbar Nagar) ::8. Pir Khan: Faujdar of Hooghly By the end of his reign major re-alignments in positions had to be effected. They were very important in context of the times to come. ::1. Alivardi Khan: Naib Subahdar of Azimabad (Patna / Bihar) ::2. Elder son, Sarfaraz Khan: Naib (Deputy) Subahdar of Dacca ::3. Younger son-in-law, Mirza Lutfullah: Naib (Deputy) Subahdar of Odisha Revenue relief and settlement =Re-settlement of deprived Hindu Zamindars= The Siyar-ul-Mutakherin also mentions that his equity was no less conspicuous towards the Zamindars and other landholders of Bengal. These persons, under Murshid Quli's administration (see: Murshid Quli Khan), had been mostly kept in confinement, and tormented in such a variety of ways, that it would be a pity to spend paper and ink in describing them. Shuja after having firmly established his government, released such of the Zamindars and other landholders as he found on enquiry free from crime or fraud ; as to the others, he ordered them to be all brought into his presence, and to form a circle round his person. This being done, he asked them, how they would behave in future, should he release them. These poor people, who had been for years languishing in dungeons, surprised at this address, burst forth into encomiums on his goodness, and after supplicating heaven to grant him a long and prosperous government, promised that henceforward they would pay the revenue with punctuality, and would prove obedient and dutiful servants. Engagements in their own handwriting, authenticated by the proper formalities, being taken from them, they confirmed them by the most solemn oaths. Shuja now sent for a number of rich dresses for each, according to his respective rank and station, so that there was not one in that assembly who did not receive a suitable present. This ceremony being over they were all released, with injunctions to transmit henceforward the revenue through the house of Jagat Seth, Fateh Chand. =Revenue settlement= By this stroke of policy, over and above the profits of 'Jagirs' and fees on ware-houses and factories, he easily raised one crore and fifty lakhs (fifteen million) of rupees, which he remitted to the Imperial Treasury through the Banking Agency of Jagat Seth Fatih Chand. By selling off at fancy prices to Zamindars the jaded horses, cattle, and other livestock, as well as damaged carpets and curtains belonging to the private estate of Nawab Murshid Quli Khan, he sent another forty lakhs (four million) of rupees, besides elephants, to Emperor Muhammad Shah. And after the Abstract Balance Sheet of the Annual Accounts was prepared, he remitted to the Imperial Capital the stipulated annual tribute of the Nizamat, besides the Imperial Revenue, according to the established conventions. Prosperity and public welfare Shuja-ud-Din Muhammad Khan, inherited (from Murshid Quli Khan) a treasury which was full. He enhanced it further and spent liberally on public welfare. He surpassed his predecessors in office in paraphernalia of royalty and armaments, and though his prime of life had passed, he did not scorn life's pleasures. Dismantling the public buildings erected by Murshid Quli Khan, as they seemed too small according to his lofty ideals, he built instead a grand and spacious Palace, an Arsenal, a lofty Gateway, a Revenue Court, a Public Audience-Hall, a Private Office, a Boudoir for Ladies, a Reception- Hall, a Court of Exchequer and a Court of Justice. He lived in magnificent splendour, and used to ride out in right regal state. He attended constantly to the well-being of his Army, and to the happiness of his subjects. On his officers, he lavished largesse amounting to no less than one thousand or five hundred rupees in each case. Nazir Ahmad (an official of Murshid Quli) had laid the foundation of a Mosque with a garden on the banks of the river Bhagirathi. Shuja, after executing him, finished the mosque and garden, and named them after himself. He tastefully embellished the garden by building therein grand palaces with reservoirs, canals and numerous fountains. It was a splendid garden, compared with which the spring-houses of Kashmir paled like withering autumn-gardens ; nay, the garden of Iram itself seemed to draw its inspiration of freshness and sweetness from it. Shuja ud-Din used frequently to resort for promenades and picnics to that paradise-like garden, and held there pleasure-parties and other entertainments. Every year in that beautiful garden, he used to give a State Banquet to the educated section of his State Officers. Rise of powerful advisors This period saw the rise of important state officials like: ::* Alivardi Khan who was the Naib Nazim of Azimabad (once annexed to Bengal) ::* Haji Ahmed (brother of Alivardi Khan) who was the Chief Counsellor to the Nizamat ::* Rai Alam Chand who became Diwan of Bengal (was given the title of Ray-Rayan) ::* Jagat Seth, Fateh Chand became the Banker to the Nawab Their power came from the fact that the Nawab trusted them and mostly left them unsupervised, concentrating on matters of his please. These aides turned out to be very able, efficient and loyal and executed their responsibilities to the satisfaction of the Nawab. The experience would come in good stead as they would play a very active role in the future of Bengal for the next two to three decades. Shuja trusted and rewarded their loyalty but was wise enough to keep their ambitions under a check through proper balances. He was largely unsuccessful and this his successor Sarfaraz Khan would experience in 1740. First altercation with the British East India Company The new Faujdar of Hugli, Pir Khan (Shuja Quli Khan), commenced exactions and oppressions. The Port of Hugli from his acts of omission and commission was ruined; and he commenced quarrelling with the European merchants. On the pretext of collecting the customs-duties of the Imperial Customs House, he requisitioned troops from the Emperor, commenced hostility with the English, Dutch, and French, and levied Nazars and taxes. It is said that once while unloading from English vessels bales of silk and cotton, and placing these below the fort he unfairly confiscated them. The English troops advancing from Calcutta, arrived near the fort. Pir Khan finding himself an unequal match for them climbed down, when the English troops carried off their goods. The aforesaid Khan; writing to Nawab Shuja ud- Daulah requisitioned troops to attack the English and by cutting off supplies of Qasimbazar (Cossimbazar / Cassimbazar) and Calcutta, he reduced them to straits. The Chief of the English Factory at Qasimbazar was compelled in consequence to arrange terms of peace, by agreeing to pay three lakhs (three hundred thousand) of rupees as nazar to the Nawab. The Chief of the English Factory in Calcutta, borrowing the nazarana money from the Calcutta bankers, remitted it to Murshidabad. Personality Shuja-ud-Din is remembered as the most successful Nawab of Bengal who ushered in a reign of \\"rare\\" prosperity in Bengal, in the 18th century. He had the experience and the tact to handle a vast array of circumstances and learned well from Murshid Quli Khan. He was a firm follower of Islam and contributed heavily to the conversion of Bengal to Islam. His family including the previous kings were themselves recent converts Bengalis and Oriyas to Islam. He was known to be shrewd, firm, a well-educated and well-mannered person. He started an era of development in Bengal (in the 18th century). While Murshid Quli hailed from the \\"Aurangzeb school of thought\\", Shuja was more of a realist, practical and a mild mannered person. Siyar-ul-Mutakherin by Mir Gholam Hussein-Khan Tabtabai (translated into English by Lieutenant Colonel John Briggs, M.R.A.S., The British East India Company (Madras Army) in May 1831.) notes that the reign of Nawab Shuja-ud-din Muhammad was one of the best (twelve) years of the 18th century for the Subah of Bengal. Well known to be a mild, just, secular and God fearing person Shuja was always interested in learning, jurisprudence and meeting new people who visited Murshidabad from other parts of the world. He was an able administrator and was tactful in dealing with the Mughal Emperor, Nawab of Oudh, Marathas, East India Company, his ambitious Nazims, his own son Sarfaraz Khan and ensured proper checks, balances and controls. He was vastly popular among his subjects as well as with the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah. It is important to note that Shuja never engaged in conflict but managed his resources and manpower well enough to posture, never to attack. He had at his disposal the richest province in the country but had \\"problems\\" like Oudh, marauding Marathas and a weak Mughal Emperor. He preferred sending \\"supplies\\" to Delhi rather than \\"armies\\" to fight for the declining Mughals. He had advised caution while dealing with Nadir Shah and adopted a \\"hands off\\" approach on learning that Nadir had left Persia for Delhi. He however kept on sending a part of his revenue collection to Delhi and unlike the Nawab of Oudh kept away from the court intrigues in the Red Fort. It is ironical that Bengal suffered its worst famines and poverty levels one century later. Death and succession Shuja-ud-Din's masouleum at Roshnibagh Shuja-ud-Din's tomb A great perturbation was caused in 1739 by the approach of Nader Shah. Shuja ud- Din fell ill and fearing his death he sent Durdan Begum and his son to Odisha. He also appointed Sarfaraz Khan as his heir and successor. He also enjoined Sarfaraz Khan to regard Haji Ahmed, Alam Chand (Roy Royan Alam Chand) and Jagat Seth as his steadfast counsellor and was to follow their advice in all affairs of moment. But, Sarfaraz Khan had no cordiality towards them and promised to obey Shuja ud-Din's commands, fearing to offend his dying father. Shuja ud-Din died on 26 August 1739 leaving behind two sons and two daughters. He lies buried in Roshnibag in Murshidabad. Shuja ud-Din Muhammad Khan was succeeded by his son, Sarfaraz Khan. His death coincided with the invasion of Delhi by Nader Shah. In that year, Alivardi Khan (army commander of Sarfaraz Khan) with the help of Jagat Seths and few powerful land magnets deposed and killed Sarfaraz Khan. Alivardi Khan then proclaimed himself as next Nawab of Bengal. Shuja-ud-Din left behind a very rich and prosperous Bengal to a very average successor, Sarfaraz Khan who had contenders (certainly) better than him. The Nasiri Dynasty lasted for another thirteen months and ended with Sarfaraz Khan.

It tells of the life and opinions of Reger, a 'musical philosopher', through the voice of his acquaintance Atzbacher, a 'private academic'. Plot summary The bookPage references are to the 1988 Suhrkamp paperback edition, is set in Vienna on one day around the year of its publication, 1985. (p. 193) Reger is an 82-year-old music critic who writes pieces for The Times. For over thirty years he has sat on the same bench in front of Tintoretto's White-bearded Man in the Bordone Room of the Kunsthistorisches Museum for four or five hours of the morning of every second day. He finds this environment the one in which he can do his best thinking. He is aided in this habit by the gallery attendant Irrsigler, who prevents other visitors from using the bench when Reger requires it. The book is narrated entirely by Atzbacher, who met Reger in the museum the day before and with whom Reger then arranged to meet again in the museum on this day - thus, exceptionally, visiting the museum on two consecutive days. They had arranged to meet in the Bordone Room at 11.30, but they both arrive early, and the first 170 pages of the book consist of Atzbacher's thoughts and recollections as he surreptitiously watches Reger in his usual position. These are dominated by Reger's thoughts and recollections, as previously related to Atzbacher. Atzbacher tells of the deaths of Reger's wife and sister, and of his contempt for various aspects of Austrian and occasionally German society, including Beethoven, Bruckner, Heidegger and Stifter, the state and \\"state artists\\" in general, and the sanitary condition of Viennese toilets. Reger considers the idea of a supposed \\"perfect\\" work of art to be unbearable, and so seeks to render them bearable by finding flaws within them. The second half of the book, once Atzbacher and Reger have met, is formed of the intertwined reports of Reger's speech now, in the museum, with what he had earlier said at a meeting of the two in the Ambassador hotel after his wife's death, and his statements when they had met in Reger's flat before her death. This death of Reger's wife - its circumstances and its effects on him - increasingly dominate the book as it moves towards its conclusion. It is revealed that Reger had first met his wife while sitting on the Bordone Room bench, and that she had then accompanied him on his visits to the museum. It was while walking there in winter that she had suffered an ultimately fatal fall, for which Reger blames the town authorities (for failing to maintain the path), the state (the owner of the museum, which failed to provide timely aid), and the Catholic church, which runs the Merciful Brethren Hospital which Reger believes botched an operation which could have saved her. Despite his continued attacks on the \\"Catholic National Socialist\\" museum and state (p. 301) and his contempt for humanity, exemplified by the conduct of his housekeeper in taking advantage of him after his wife's death, Reger describes how he overcame his initial inclination to suicide and managed to survive her. He found himself let down by art, which proved useless to him at the decisive moment: Convinced that people are the only possible means of survival, Reger re-engages with the world, aided only by his \\"misuse\\" of Schopenhauer (p. 288) and by the White-bearded Man, the only work in the museum to have stood up to his scrutiny for thirty years. The book concludes with Reger revealing the true purpose of his arranging to meet Atzbacher: to invite him to a performance of The Broken Jug that evening, despite his own hatred for drama. Atzbacher accepts, reporting that \\"the performance was terrible\\". Notes References *Bernhardiana, a Critical Anthology of Bernhard's works *\\"On Thomas Bernhard\\" by Jason M.

He was a member of the 1818 Constitutional Convention and also served on the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. Death Treadwell, a Congregationalist, died in Farmington, Hartford County, Connecticut, on August 18, 1823 (age 77 years, 268 days). He is interred at Farmington Old Cemetery. He was a founder of the Connecticut Missionary Society, the missionary arm of the Connecticut General Association of Congregational ministers.

Under the communist German Democratic Republic, from 1949 to 1990, it remained closely connected to the academy; unlike other publishing houses, it was not subject to direct control by the GDR ministry of culture. Still, it was regarded with suspicion in the West due to communist influence. Most of the output was sold in East Germany and the Eastern Bloc. Since 1957, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, the founder of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in 1700, and ‚Äûtheoria cum praxi‚Äú are used as symbols. Since the 1970s, several volumes of the Nicolaus Copernicus Gesamtausgabe (complete edition) have been published by Akademie Verlag, covering many documents from and about Nicolaus Copernicus in detail. Astronomische Nachrichten (Astronomical Notes), one of the first international journals in the field of astronomy, founded in 1821, was published by Akademie Verlag for several decades as well as physica status solidi, founded in 1961. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the employees rejected their boss and elected one of themselves as successor. As it had managed to build enough of a reputation in the West, several offers were made for Akademie Verlag, and the new German states (including Berlin) sold it on 3 January 1991 to VCH Verlagsgruppe Weinheim. As a result, of the 170 employees in 1991, only 40 remained until the 50th anniversary in 1996. The rather broad range of publications was reduced to focus on philosophy, history, political and cultural sciences, history of art, literature, and lingual sciences plus mathematics and physics. When John Wiley & Sons took over VCH, the natural scientific branch of Akademie Verlag was moved to Wiley-VCH, while the humanities section, including its name and logo, was transferred on 1 October 1997 to R.

The Phiale Painter is assumed to have been a pupil of the Achilles Painter. In contrast to his master, he liked to depict narrative scenes. He painted several large chalice kraters, often with two registers of figures; unlike his master, he seems to have preferred larger vessels in general. This is shown by his white-ground works, which are not well known, but more expressive than those of the Achilles Painter. Apart from a number of lekythoi, he painted two chalice kraters in white-ground technique, a rarity at the time. His themes may be partially influenced by contemporary theatre. His preferred name for kalos inscriptions is that of Euaion, son of Aeschylus. His conventional name is based on the fact that a painted phiale, a vase shape rarely equipped with figural depictions, is known from him. Bibliography * John Beazley. Attic Red Figure Vase Painters.

Carotenoid pigments are indicative of photosynthetic light use efficiency, or the rate of carbon dioxide uptake by foliage per unit energy absorbed. As such, it is used in studies of vegetation productivity and stress. Because the PRI measures plant responses to stress, it can be used to assess general ecosystem health using satellite data or other forms of remote sensing. Applications include vegetation health in evergreen shrublands, forests, and agricultural crops prior to senescence.

The Great Dividing Range passes in a north‚Äìsouth direction through the Central Tablelands and includes the Blue Mountains. The region shares borders with the Hunter, Central West Slopes and Plains, Southern Tablelands, North Western Slopes and Plains, the Sydney Metropolitan Area and the Illawarra. Several main State highways pass through the Central Tablelands including the Great Western Highway, Mitchell Highway, Golden Highway, Castlereagh Highway and the Mid-Western Highway. The main western railway line from Sydney passes through the Central Tablelands, east to west direction initially on the Blue Mountains railway line, then continuing with the Main Western Railway line. The main towns within the Central Tablelands, listed by population, include Orange, Bathurst, Lithgow, Mudgee, Cowra, Wellington, Blayney, Oberon, Gulgong, and Portland. History In May 1813 explorers Blaxland, Wentworth, and Lawson setout to discover the inland to the west of Sydney, over the Blue Mountains. The group climbed the mountains and on reaching the top of the ridges they continued west to a point later named Mount Blaxland (south of present-day Rydal). This was the first access by Europeans to the area now known as the Central Tablelands. Governor Macquarie ordered a second expedition, in November 1813, led by government surveyor George Evans, this second expedition travelled further and reached the site now known as the city of Bathurst. Geology and Landforms The Central Tablelands region of New South Wales lies largely within the Lachlan Fold Belt tectonic zone. Eastern portion (surrounding Katoomba) The eastern portion of the Central Tablelands covers the area known as the Blue Mountains, New South Wales to the west of the Sydney basin. The area is drained by many creeks and rivers, including Cox's River, Jenolan River, Kanangra River, and Kowmung River which in turn flow into the Hawkesbury-Nepean river system. The Blue Mountains are an extensive Triassic sandstone plateau rising to near Mount Victoria. The Blue Mountains terminate in a north‚Äìsouth line of cliffs that form the eastern edge of the Hartley, Kanimbla and Megalong Valleys. Western portion (surrounding Bathurst) Two physical components comprise the Central Tablelands region surrounding Bathurst; the Bathurst Basin and the Tablelands areas. They are drained by the Macquarie, Turon, Fish and Campbells Rivers to the north and Abercrombie and Isabella Rivers to the south. The central basin area of the Bathurst area is mainly granite soils while in the north area sandstone, conglomerates, greywacke, siltstones, limestones and minor volcanos predominate. The south is more complex geology with siltstones, sandstones, greywacke, shales and chert, basalt and granite intrusions and embedded volcanic and limestones. Underlying Bathurst is the dominant feature of Bathurst granite (intruded in the Devonian period) and at Mount Panorama and Mount Stewart basalt occurs. Topography of the region ranges from slightly undulating to rough and very steep country, approximately 30 km to the east of Bathurst is the folded and faulted sedimentary and metamorphosed formations of the Great Dividing Range which runs roughly north‚Äìsouth. Northern portion (surrounding Mudgee) Geology of the area surrounding Mudgee and Gulgong forms part of the north eastern margin of the Lachlan Fold Belt tectonic zone. This northern area is traversed by the Cudegong River which rises in the mountains of the Great Divide, flowing west into the Murray-Darling river system. At the head of the valley, to the east, high mountains are of volcanic origin, and capped in basalt lava flows deposited some 17 million years ago. Nullo Mountain is the most extensive, and Mount Coricudgy the loftiest at . The high mountainous eastern area is a spectacular landscape with basalt peaks, sandstone ravines and rainforest gorges. This high land falls to the west into wide basins of agricultural country. The Cudgegong River collects the fertile basalt enriched volcanics from the mountains and deposits them in the broad fertile alluvial flat agricultural lands to the west. Climate Due to its location and elevation 390‚Äì1395 meters ASL the Central Tablelands has its four seasons. Summer can be quite hot with temperatures exceeding 40 ¬∞C (104 ¬∞F) on the hottest days, although afternoons in summer tend to cool down and most summer nights are around 13 ¬∞C (55.4 ¬∞F). Autumn is when the district starts to cool down. Around April frosts start occurring and temperatures below 0 ¬∞C (32 ¬∞F) may also occur. The district tends to be quite windy in autumn and days sometimes struggle to reach 18 ¬∞C (64.4 ¬∞F). Winter is the coldest season and daytime temperatures struggle to get above 7 ¬∞C (44.6 ¬∞F). When the south-westerly winds blow on winter nights the temperature can go as low as ‚àí8 ¬∞C (17.6 ¬∞F) and feel much colder. Severe frosts occur frequently during winter. In the higher parts over 1000 metres ASL, several snowfalls occur each winter. Spring is when the temperature starts to warm, although frosts and sometimes snow still occur in early spring. Around mid- spring the temperature can get as high as 24 ¬∞C (75.2 ¬∞F), sometimes even higher. Around spring all the crops and flowers start growing in the Central Tablelands. Nights in spring may still drop below 0 ¬∞C (32 ¬∞F), especially if the wind is blowing. The area tends to be quite dry when it comes to rainfall. Rain can be expected any day of the year but usually the heaviest rainfall is around October. The average rainfall for the district is between 500 and 700 mm per year. Some years may even be wetter or drier. The highest temperature in the Central Tablelands was 44.7 ¬∞C (112.5 ¬∞F) at Bathurst Gaol, in January 1878. The lowest temperature was ‚àí11.1 ¬∞C (12.0 ¬∞F) at Marrangaroo, in July 2018. Economy Flora and fauna Naming New South Wales can be divided into four broad landform components: * the coastal regions fronting the Tasman Sea in the east of the State * the highlands (elevated tablelands) which form part of the Great Dividing Range * the western (inland) slopes of the highlands, which form the main agricultural region of the State * the arid western plains The four geographic components are then typically divided into north, central and southern areas based upon their location relative to Sydney.

The 3rd Battalion, 16th Field Artillery Regiment (3/16 FA) and the 204th Brigade Support Battalion (204th BSB) supported brigade combat operations in the An- Najaf and Babil provinces. The units sent M1114 Gun Trucks on Reconnaissance & Security (R&S;) patrols outside the FOB. The patrols checked on all noticeable areas of interest (NAIs) outside the base and established observation posts (OPs) to detect suspicious persons, vehicles or activity near the FOB. Unauthorized persons, vehicles and/or activities presented a threat to the FOB and resupply convoys. They also made sure the protective concertina wire around the FOB was intact. They also had a ‚Äúcop on the beat‚Äù role, monitoring local Bedouins and ensured that only authorized persons were present at landfill sites near the FOB. During daily R&S; patrols, the Soldiers occasionally discovered Iraqi civilians exploring the bunkers outside the FOB for usable items that had been discarded or abandoned.

Establishment Forward Operating Base (FOB) Iskandariyah was first established as Forward Operating Base Chosin by 1st Battalion, 32nd Infantry Regiment, 1st Brigade, 10th Mountain Division in 2003 during Operation Iraqi Freedom I. The 1st Battalion of the 32nd Infantry Regiment ( 1-32IN ) first landed on the grounds of the Musayyib power plant in September 2003. A ground convoy moved in after negotiating its way through the southern regions of Iraq. After the remainder of the battalion was airlifted in, its entirety moved into the shells of old warehouses. They would live there for weeks. As time passed, the ‚ÄúChosin Battalion‚Äù continued to conduct combat operations from the power plant. Contact was made with both the locals and the enemy. Over time, more civilized structures were erected (wood framed canvas tents, plywood showers, etc.). The soldiers of the ‚ÄòQueen‚Äôs Own‚Äô continued to fight the opposition in the surrounding AO until the U.S. Marines called them for assistance to the north in Ramadi. This facility largely consisted of tents and other structures of a temporary nature. During this period, 1-32nd IN also established facilities for the 507th Iraqi National Guard Battalion.bn%20oif%2003-04%20history.doc Fort Drum Tenant Units: 3rd BCT, 1-32nd IN Responsibility for all these facilities were handed over to 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade, 1st Armored Division for a brief period, while 1-32nd IN was posted to Camp Habbaniyah near Fallujah in April 2004 before returning in June of the same year. The 1-32nd IN remained at FOB Chosin until the facilities were turned over to the headquarters of the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit late in 2004. All facilities were partially dismantled following the tenure of the 24th MEU. One remaining vestige of the previous designation carried over in the name of Landing Zone Chosin when the facility became known as Forward Operating Base Iskandariyah. Reestablishment as FOB Iskandariyah As the site of a major power production center for the greater Baghdad area, the facility was deemed as vital to continued security operations by the United States military and Iraqi security forces. The location also provided a midpoint for traffic between Baghdad and Karbala. Therefore, a permanent tenant was established with the 1st Battalion, 155th Infantry Regiment, 155th Heavy Brigade Combat Team of the Mississippi National Guard during Operation Iraqi Freedom III, beginning in 2005. Operation Iraqi Freedom IV followed in late 2005 with the transfer of authority to 1st Battalion, 67th Armor Regiment of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division. A nearby facility for 2nd Battalion, 4th Brigade, 8th Division (Iraqi Army) was established immediately adjacent as Iraqi forces undertook increased organized participation in local security operations. A US Army Military Transition Team was assigned to this facility to oversee training, coordinate combined operations and facilitate additional US military resources. The 1st Battalion, 67th Armor Regiment (1-67th AR) contributed to dramatic improvements in the quality of living facilities and security measures protecting the FOB. In late 2006, authority was in turn transferred to 1st Battalion, 501st Infantry Regiment (Airborne) of the 4th Brigade Combat Team (Airborne), 25th Infantry Division as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom V. This rotation coincided with the Iraq War troop surge of 2007 and the first cooperation with Sunnis formed into what was then locally known as the Concerned Citizens' Program (CCP), part of the wider Sons of Iraq movement. FOB Iskandariyah also experienced a significant increase in forces as 1-501st IN (ABN) expanded into an enlarged battalion task force. Facility improvement continued as well as cooperation with civil authorities to maintain and increase capacity of both the co- located power plant and a nearby gas facility under construction. Attacks against the facility diminished during the period following increased security efforts by US and Iraqi forces. Last US military tenant unit and closure After an extended 15-month tour, 1-501st IN (ABN) transferred the FOB to the authority of 3rd Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment of the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division. Their tenure during Operation Iraqi Freedom VI was marked by a continued decrease in insurgent violence as seen throughout the 2008 campaign year and constituted a factor in the eventual determination to return control of security efforts and government authority to Babil governorate authorities. The return of provincial control also created favorable conditions for the closure of FOB Iskandariyah in late 2008. In 2009, the successors of 3-7th IN, HHC (-) 1st Battalion, 2nd Infantry Regiment 172nd Infantry Brigade, began the process necessary to close American facilities on the installation and pass the FOB to Iraqi control. On 22 February 2009, the 172nd Infantry Brigade formally returned the FOB to Iraqi control.

Circa 470 BCE. Athens, National Archaeological Museum. The Pan Painter was an ancient Greek vase-painter of the Attic red-figure style, probably active c. 480 to 450 BCE. John Beazley attributed over 150 vases to his hand in 1912:  Archaic Mannerism  Beazley identified the Pan Painter as a pupil of Myson, teacher of the Mannerists (beginning around the 470's B.C.E), a term applied (often pejoratively) to a group who used \\"mannered\\" depiction of figures for decorative effect. Mannerists also magnified the gestures, made most forms skinnier and at the same time shrunk the heads of the figures. More attention was given to the pattern that clothing offered than the naturalization of the human form. Most often, either black buds or black ivy create frames around the scenes. Most of the pottery that has been attributed to Mannerists are pelikai, hydriai, and kraters. Though the original names of the artists are unknown, historians have given artists names based on pieces that seem to be painted by the same person or group of artists; some Archaic Mannerist artists are: the Pig Painter, Agrigento Painter, Oinanthe Painter, Perseus Painter, Leningrad Painter, and Pan Painter.  Pan Painter Style  While the Mannerists are marked starting in the 470s BCE, some of the Pan Painter's vases have been dated around the 480s BCE. The Pan Painter's heads have the illusion of being smaller than they are next to the largely painted necks, small eyes and small noses. The chins, however, are strong and rounded.The Pan Painter's restrained use of ornament and his coherent continuous compositions, however, set him apart from the Mannnerists. His assured outlines and deft handling of space and volume are \\"characteristic of the best of the Archaic period\\". The Pan Painter depicted scenes from day-to-day life as well as Greek myth, which were common subjects in red-figure painting. His style used techniques from archaic painting, but he brought new aspects to the paintings.  Attributed vases   Pan Painter's name-vase  His name-vase is a bell krater (in Boston's Museum of Fine Arts collection) depicting Pan pursuing a goatherd on one side and Artemis killing Aktaion on the reverse side. The folds in the clothing separate the Pan Painter from other Archaic depictions of cloth. The Pan Painter creates space by foreshortening Artemis' foot and Aktaion's legs. A column krater depicting Dionysus has a careful illustration of a satyr carrying a full cup. The Pan Painter painted the hands near the bottom of the cup giving weight to the satyr's task (in the MET). The oinochoe that depicts Ganymede running from Zeus while holding a rooster, a hoop and a stick contains the common theme of one character running away from another (in the MET). The Attic lekythos depicting Nike is an excellent example of the Pan Painter's attention to detail. The Pan Painter gives care to lines creating the clothing and the indent from one feather to the next on the edge of Nike's wings (in New Jersey). A pelike depicts a youth carrying furniture, likely getting ready for a symposium or during a one. On the other side is an older man holding rods in his hand, possibly ready to discipline the boy if he dropped the furniture.

Herakles is shown in the middle of beating another man. (in the MET) The Alkimachos Painter may have been inspired by the Pan Painter because of the resemblances seen in the Greek and Amazon Nolan amphora.

They consist of Mesozoic limestones, shales and marls that were originally deposited on the southern continental margin of the European continent. During the Alpine orogeny they were thrusted north over a d√©collement and at the same time were internally deformed by folding and thrusting. Tectonic location The Helvetic nappes are thrusted over the Infrahelvetic complex and the external massifs of the Alps (like the Aarmassif or Mont Blanc Massif). In Switzerland, Germany and Austria they are also thrusted over the Molasse basin of the Alpine foreland. In turn, the Helvetic nappes were overthrusted by the Penninic nappes from the south. In Switzerland these have been eroded away at most places but in Germany and Austria they are still covering the Helvetic nappes. Due to this the Helvetic nappes only crop out as a thin band in those countries, which forms the Northern Limestone Alps. Lithology The Helvetic nappes consist of Mesozoic sedimentary rocks deposited on the former southern continental margin of the European plate. A narrow ocean, the Valais Ocean, existed south of Central Europe in the Mesozoic. This later developed into a convergent plate boundary where the European plate subducted beneath the Apulian plate. The sedimentary facies of the rocks from this age thus becomes deeper marine when the rocks were deposited further south. Therefore, the rocks of the Helvetic nappes have a shallower marine facies than the contemporary B√ºndner slates of the Penninic nappes; and a deeper facies than the rocks of the Infrahelvetic complex of Eastern Switzerland or contemporary sediments in the Jura Mountains north of the Alps.

The scoring is for twenty strings, harp, and twenty-one types of percussion, with solo parts for clarinet, violoncello, and concert accordion for the award-winning Trio NeuKlang, and a vocal part created expressly for the composer's wife, the soprano Andi√≥n Fern√°ndez.  Sections of the work  The symphony is divided into two movements of about seventeen minutes each, with the following unusual titles: * I. Gift of Mrs. Eric Schroeder, inv. no. 1982.116 (Omaggio a Nicolas R√©gnier, Girolamo Frescobaldi, ed Athanasius Kircher) * II. L'ambassade ottomane, Paris, Guangxu 16.run 2.07 (Hommage √† Kantemiroƒülu et Xue Fucheng)  First movement  The first movement takes its title from the catalogue description of Self-portrait with a Portrait on an Easel by Nicolas R√©gnier, a Franco-Flemish artist working in Rome in the 1620s. Both painter and his painted subject look straight in the viewer's direction, which could encompass the live subject of the portrait within the self-portrait, or the painter himself in reflection, or a third-party viewer, or some combination of the three. These split levels of perceptual reality are allegorically represented in the tunings of four string instruments a quarter-tone sharp or flat, and in the alternate or simultaneous soundings of the same musical phrase between them and instruments in normal intonation. As the movement may be construed as a self-portrait of the composer, it is in effect a ‚ÄòSelf-portrait with a Self- portrait with a Portrait on an Easel‚Äô, incorporating themes based on the letters of both Ching's European and Chinese names (G-E-F-F-Re-C-H and Z-U-X- I-N). The sub-sections of the first movement are all constructed around compositional devices from the keyboard works of R√©gnier's contemporary, Girolamo Frescobaldi, organist of St. Peter's in Rome. Occasionally motifs are inverted, reversed, metrically distorted, superimposed as plainchant. In the central section in recitative style (accompanied by clarinet multiphonics, ‚Äòcello harmonics, and various vibrato and glissando effects in harp and accordion), fragments from four of Frescobaldi‚Äôs Arie musicali of 1628‚Äì30 are fitted by the soprano to the last Ming emperor‚Äôs suicide speech of April 1644, which translates: > I am not the prince of a fallen kingdom, but ye are her subjects all. Though > I have not been ungenerous to thee, why then, now that we are come to such a > pass, is there not one of my ministers here to attend me? The symphony is named after the pioneering ‚ÄòCabinet of Curiosities‚Äô (Kunstkammer) assembled by another Roman contemporary, the German Jesuit Athanasius Kircher. He also collected musical canons of extreme artificiality in his Musurgia universalis of 1650. Accordingly, the first movement ends with an extensive six-part canon on five subjects with entries in all twelve tonalities, demonstrating all the themes heard hitherto to be combinable in any vertical or horizontal order. A contrived seventh part for the soprano allows her Frescobaldi fragments to be heard at last with their original Italian text, which closely parallels the words of the unhappy Chinese ruler: > May the hour chime out when you will triumph victorious over the pride of > Thrace [i.e., the Turks]‚Ä¶.The vain pleasures that I receive out of > friendship are at present sources of reproach and accusations‚Ä¶.\\"Alas,\\" she > said, \\"why must it be, O my Lord, that thou dost endure without me these > last moments? How shall I be able to live if thou dost die?\\" ‚Ä¶I die without > having known who I am, who I was, but I flee not so much death as the anger > of others‚Ä¶.  Second movement  The second movement was inspired by the courtesy call of the Chinese ambassador Xue Fucheng at the Ottoman Embassy, Paris on 27 March 1890, as briefly recounted in his diary entry of that date: > The Turkish ambassador confided in me with tears in his eyes. He contended > that both England and France are threatening the future of both our > countries with their superpower weaponry, and in today‚Äôs world there is no > justice as far as territorial disputes are concerned. The nation that is > best equipped with powerful cannons and fast battleships can devour any > large portion of territory at will, and thus all this talk of international > law is sheer nonsense. The movement's themes are drawn entirely from eighteenth-century Turkish and Chinese musical sources‚Äîthe 352 musical notations of Kantemiroƒülu (or Dimitrie Cantemir), a Moldavian prince at Sultan Ahmed III‚Äôs court, and the numerous pieces of ceremonial music recorded in the Qing dynasty‚Äôs 1724 publication, Imperially Commissioned True Explication of Music Theory. From the former are excerpted twenty-one pieces, mostly Janissary marches, variously altered and reassembled; from the latter, three pieces of Qing court music in their entirety, slow chords in fourths and fifths heard mostly as harmonic background, but also used to punctuate the Turkish excerpts. All the melodic material uses either the thirty-one-note Ottoman scale with four quarter-tones or the twenty-four-note Qing scale with twelve eighth-tones. To begin with, Turkish and Chinese phrases hear each other out with diplomatic finesse, but eventually overlap and dovetail in a ‚Äònew world order‚Äô of mutual dependence entailing no loss of melodic autonomy. The soprano chants random Turkish vocables of the ‚Äòterenn√ºm‚Äô type, and then intones Chinese verses celebrating the universal peace symbolised by the Lunar New Year‚Äôs Day audiences of the Qing emperor. After a brief pause the Janissary march H√ºnkar pe≈ürevi (The Sultan‚Äôs Prelude) is used to generate a twenty-four-part fugue constructed on thirty-six Ottoman modes (makams or terk√Æbs) and twelve Ottoman rhythmic cycles (us√ªls). The fugue‚Äôs twenty-four parts are really twice twelve, in that a melodic voice is invariably paired with a rhythmic partner (usually a string instrument struck with the wood of the bow, or plucked, but also timpani and harp). Of the twenty-nine entries of the theme, twenty-five are extreme metric departures from the original, so that the fugue is concurrently a series of twenty-five variations. The fugue as such, no more Turkish than the European fashions aped in Istanbul during her decadent ‚ÄòTulip period‚Äô (1703‚Äì30), does exhibit two indubitably Ottoman peculiarities: The thirty-six rapid changes of mode heard in the solo ‚Äòcello part, but also distributed three each among the twelve fugal pairs, derive from the esoteric compositional genre k√ºlliyat; and the sudden disappearances and reappearances among the twice-twelve parts after all have entered is in the karabatak or ‚Äòcormorant‚Äô style (named for the aquatic fowl that so erratically dart in and out of water). The coda lays out the Ottoman and Qing scales in parallel, first ascending and then descending, while the snare drum plays the solo ‚Äòcello‚Äôs rhythm from the last bar of the fugue, first forwards (while the scales ascend) and then backwards (while they descend). Both rising and falling, the two scales coincide at only seven points, singled out for emphasis by harp and soprano, the latter singing their Italian solfeggio names (do fa sol si do fa sol). After surreal interruptions by each of the twelve fugal pairs in incipit, the last four notes of the descending Ottoman scale turn into a quotation of a Frescobaldian motif from the first movement, ushering the whole symphony to a full close on C.

He also worked training Portuguese troops and spent time serving in Ireland during the 1798 rebellion and Canada. Otway retired after the Peninsula War and was honoured several times for his war service by both the British and Spanish royal families. Early career Otway was born the fourth of five sons to Cooke and Elizabeth Otway of Castle Otway, Tipperary. The family had a strong military tradition, Cooke Otway was an officer in the local militia and Loftus's elder brother Robert Waller Otway later became an admiral and baronet. Otway joined the army aged 21 in 1796 during the French Revolutionary Wars, taking a post in the 5th Dragoon Guards as a cornet. Within months he had purchased advancement to lieutenant and was with the regiment when they were posted to Ireland in October 1796, prior to the outbreak of the 1798 Rebellion. Otway's service in quelling the uprising is not clear, but he was certainly present at the Battle of Vinegar Hill on 21 June 1798, when his unit was employed in riding down the panicking rebels at the collapse of the rebellion.Otway, Sir Loftus William, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, John Sweetman, Retrieved 28 November 2007 Napoleonic Wars Otway continued to use family and financial influence to climb the ranks, becoming a captain in October 1798 and major in 1803 after the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars. In 1804, Otway transferred to the 8th Dragoons and spent time in Canada in the adjutant- generals office. Returning to Europe in 1807, Otway volunteered for service in Portugal and Spain with the 18th Light Dragoons and was attached to Sir Arthur Wellesley's army, although he did not see any action before the temporary peace treaty. Joining Sir John Moore's forces in Galicia, Otway's regiment was instrumental in covering its retreat to Corunna and was engaged in several cavalry engagements at Rueda, Valladolid, Sahag√∫n and Benavente. In the course of these operations, Otway distinguished himself and captured a large quantity of enemy troops, including a French general. Evacuated from Corunna on 16 January 1809, Otway's regiment was stationed in England and Otway took leave, returning to Wellesley's army in the Peninsula to command a Portuguese cavalry brigade under William Beresford. With this force, Otway was repeatedly engaged, including service at the Battle of Busaco in 1810 and a victory at Campo Mayor in 1811 which was wasted by the profligacy of his senior officer Robert Ballard Long. However, Long was of the opinion, and was subsequently supported in this by the historian William Napier, that it was Beresford's refusal to release the British brigade of heavy dragoons that led to the escape of the French force.McGuffie, T.H (Ed). Peninsular Cavalry General (1811-1813): The Correspondence of Lieutenant-General Robert Ballard Long, London (1951). Letter to C.B. Long, St. Vicente, near Elvas, 28 March 1811, pp. 73-81. Otway protected the left flank of the 13th Light Dragoons with his Portuguese cavalry when they broke the French 26th Dragoons, but when sent as a support to follow the victorious 13th he allowed his own squadrons to disperse and join in the pursuit. At the Battle of Albuera which followed the Campo Mayor action, Otway performed capably on the left flank although his forces were not heavily engaged. The same day, Otway was placed on half-pay in reserve by Horse Guards as he was officially detached from his regiment. In 1812, Otway had returned to England but continued service, formulating a plan to raise a cavalry regiment of non-French prisoners of war which was ultimately rejected. Frustrated, Otway returned to Portugal and was employed for the remainder of the Peninsula War training Portuguese and Spanish cavalry regiments. In 1813 he was promoted to full colonel. Retirement The family tomb of Loftus William Otway Following the conclusion of the war, Otway retired from active military service although he remained a figure in military planning for the remainder of his life. In 1815 he was knighted by the Prince Regent in London. At the reformation of the Order of the Bath in June of the same year, Otway was made a companion. In 1819 he was promoted to major- general and in 1822 was made a Spanish Knight of the Order of Charles III. During this period he married Frances Blicke and had two children. In 1837 Otway was again promoted, to lieutenant general, and in 1840 became Colonel of the 84th Regiment of Foot. In 1851 he was given a final promotion, to the rank of full general. He died in his home at 17 Grosvenor Square in London in 1854 and was interred at Highgate Cemetery in North London.

Retrieved 26 November 2007 Hellig Usvart pioneered the previously unheard-of genre of \\"Christian black metal\\" (sometimes referred to as \\"Holy UnBlack Metal\\" as Sherlock called his music). Since its release, bands such as Dark Endless (also a black metal band with one anonymous member), Crimson Moonlight and Antestor have emerged as proponents of Christian black metal. Revulsed In 2010 Jayson and Sheldon D'Costa left inExordium to form Revulsed, a faster and more technical and extreme death metal band based in Melbourne. In 2014 they acquired the services of Konni from Defeated Sanity and Despondency to perform the vocals for the debut album Infernal Atrocity released through Permeated Records on 31 October 2015. In 2017, Revulsed released Live Atrocity - The Inception of Sufferance, through Brutal Mind, It featured Damien Miriklis on vocals and Mark Smith on bass guitar. Other projects Sherlock is also involved in a number of other bands. In 2000 he joined the band Soundscape and in 2002 he joined the band Where Shadows Lie.Jayson on the Soundscape website In 2006 he rejoined the doom metal band Paramaecium and appeared at the '06 Black Stump festival. In 2007 they went to the NordicFest in Oslo, Norway which was to be Paramaecium's final show before the creation of InExordium by the remaining members of the band. Sherlock is also part of a progressive metal band called Altera Enigma, in which Jason De Ron (Paramaecium, InExordium) is also involved. In 2009 Jayson recorded as guest drummer for Fearscape's Nightmare Hymn (to be released mid-2009 on Bombworks Records). In mid-2009, Jayson was asked to fill in for Teramaze drummer Julian Percy as Julian was unable to fulfill commitments due to a chronic heart condition. Jayson has since fulfilled his commitments with the band, and they now have a permanent drummer. Jayson joined the band Deliverance to record the album Hear What I Say!. Digital graphic artist Sherlock was known to illustrate the cover art for most of his bands' albums. He created the artwork for Mortification's albums during 1990‚Äì1993 and designed a number of their T-shirts. These works are characterised by their underground approach, which is typical for death metal music. He also created artwork for Paramaecium's debut, which showcases detailed calligraphy artwork, and Horde's Hellig Usvart, among others. Eventually Sherlock became a professional digital graphic artist.

The film is based on the novel of the same name by Marathi writer, Chintamani T. Khanolkar, the screen adaptation was made by Shyam Benegal and Girish Karnad.The Boon filmreference The majority of the cast was common to both films and included Ananth Nag, Vanisri, Amrish Puri, Shekhar Chatterjee (Hindi version only), Rao Gopal Rao (Telugu version only) and Satyadev Dubey. The film was one of the Indian entries at the 4th Hong Kong International Film Festival.http://dff.nic.in/2011/IP1981.pdf Overview The film involves the life of a young man who comes to believe that he has been bestowed supernatural powers. As the story unfolds, this boon eventually leads to a tragedy. Kondura is a story whose protagonist is a young Brahmin named Parshuram. He is married to Ansooya, but is dependent partially on his brother for a living. This makes the elder brother chide him often and that drives him away from home. However, as he is leaving \\"Kondura\\", the mythical sage from the sea appears and anoints him the guardian of village, to cure it of all sins. The sage also grants him a physical boon, which is a dried herb. The boon works if he remains celibate. Parshuram returns home to celibacy. Often, the goddess of the village, grants him appearance in person, speaking to him through his wife (a phenomenon still seen in Indian villages, where a person is believed to have sudden visitation by God or Goddess, who speaks to people through the person). The goddess instructs him to get the village rid of evils, which he interprets as rebuilding the parts of the temple. For this, he enlists financial support from the village landlord who is otherwise a tyrant and womaniser. It is known that Bhairavmoorthy takes in any woman in the village who catches his eye, including his younger brother's wife, both of whom die leaving behind a physically challenged son Venu to an otherwise heirless fiefdom. It is rumoured that Vasu is his son, but Bhairavmoorthy mistreats him all the time. He marries him off to young and beautiful Parvati, who comes from a very poor family. Bhairavmoorthy is said to be eyeing Parvati too, but Parvati is stronger than rest of the women in the family and challenges his might at occasions. Meanwhile, as the news of Kondura's boon and visitations by the Goddess coupled with constructions at the temple spreads, Parshuram becomes a revered Guru with a decent following of his own in the village. Followers see him as a counselor and a person with charisma. There are celebrations at the landlord's house. Parvati is expecting a child. The Landlord's wife Kanthama is busy doing all the ceremonies. The gossip in the village is that the baby belongs to Bhairavmoorthy. The Goddess makes a visitation to Parshuram through Ansooya, and speaks of the \\"root\\" or \\"seed\\" of evil, mentioning Bhairavamoorthy's name. In this context, it is relevant to mention a short interlude that abruptly appears repeatedly through the narrative: The short dream-like sequence features Parvati lying in bed and beckoning the camera to come to her - Conceivably this is the director's hint at a troubling thread in Parshuram's mind, that even \\"chosen\\" ones have weaknesses to overcome. It is perhaps due to such a bias, Parshuram interprets the words of the Goddess as concerning the baby, the \\"root\\" of Bhairavamoorthy's evil. To make things worse, the landlord makes Parshuram believe that the baby is his, and Parshuram makes Parvati drink Kondura's herb that aborts the baby. Once the sin is committed, the landlord makes the revelation that how he conned Parshuram into believing that the baby was his, which in reality was his nephew's, and that he could not bear the thought that his crippled nephew sires one and not him. Gripped with immense guilt, Parshuram takes a radical path of atonement. He tries to invoke the Goddess by praying to his wife, Ansooya; but, when that effort fails, he decides to repent for his sin by forsaking his celibacy. While Ansooya resists the temptation, Parshurama forces her to succumb to it. Shocked by the action and her loss of purity, Ansooya commits suicide by jumping in a dry well. Parshooram wakes up searching for Ansooya and upon finding her dead body, he runs widely screaming her name. Through the story, there is one character, Ramanayye Master, the village teacher, who does not blindly accept Parshuram's actions as Divinely sanctioned. He is seen questioning Parshuram, once even scolding him. The last shot of the film shows the teacher nodding helplessly. While intellectuals may interpret the movie as a statement against faith itself, the story actually does not deny Divinity or its manifestations; for instance, at no point are Anasooya's visitations hinted at being fake; indeed, much good did come out of the Goddess's instructions to Parshuram, as long as his self-interest did not cloud his interpretation of those instructions. More than likely, the story's ending is a nuanced take on sincere seekers, that even those with Divine experiences are not exempt from vigilance.

The Dinos Painter stood in the tradition of the Kleophon Painter, but was less serious. One or few figures are depicted as the centre of an event; the frieze-like depiction of the course of the event seen in earlier styles is absent. His paintings initiate the \\"Rich Style\\" of the following generation; he already uses an increased amount of white to stress details. The technique of using white to depict Eros and furniture is an innovation of the Dinos Painter; a generation later it formed part of the standard repertoire. Most of the works attributed to the Dinos Painter are on large vases. He is named after one of his chief works, a vase in Berlin depicting Dionysos reclining. Although most of the Dino‚Äôs Painter‚Äôs vases were found in Italy, Sicily, and Athens, his works were also found as far afield as Spain and Syria. Out of the eighteen vases found in Athens, three of them were found on the Acropolis. Three vases were found in Egypt and Syria. One vase was found in Samaria and one in Lebanon.

Hobart, Middletown Journal, January 16, 2011. was a local television personality widely known to fans as Dr. Creep. He was a horror movie host on WKEF Television in Dayton, Ohio. Early life Hobart was a native of nearby Middletown, born June 23, 1941 to parents Edward and Grace (Fullen) Hobart; he was also the nephew of horror film make-up artist and stuntman Doug Hobart, who hosted a traveling monster show in the 1940s and 1950s. Hobart graduated from Middletown High School in 1959, then attended the University of Cincinnati where he graduated in 1963 with a degree in broadcasting. After an overseas stint in the Marine Corps, Hobart returned to southwest Ohio and was hired by WKEF television as a camera specialist and Master Control Operator. Shock Theater (Theatre) In 1971, WKEF management began looking for a gimmick to garner ratings on Saturday nights. When Hobart suggested a late- night horror movie show, station management accepted the idea; encouraged by colleagues, Hobart himself auditioned for the hosting job by donning a monk's robe, fangs and skull-like make-up, initially calling himself \\"Dr. Death\\". After Hobart was given the job the fangs were abandoned and the skull face motif toned down for being too fearsome, and the character's name was changed to \\"Dr. Creep\\". Shock Theater premiered on Saturday, January 1, 1972 and was a fixture on WKEF for thirteen years. The title was also spelled Shock Theatre and by 1977 that spelling remained. During that time, Dr. Creep co-hosted Clubhouse 22, a popular weekday afternoon kids show, adding to his local star power. 1972 TV Guide ad for Shock Theater (note fangs and skull-face) Like many other late-night horror shows, Shock Theater/Shock Theatre played classic \\"B\\" horror films, with bumpers and breaks featuring the host, leaning more toward the humorous than the horrific. By the mid 1970s, Shock Theater/Shock Theatre had moved to Saturday afternoons, garnering a younger following. The show was moved back to late Saturday night by 1977; then was renamed Saturday Night Dead when WKEF changed network affiliations on January 1, 1980 and the show followed NBC's Saturday Night Live. But by the early 1980s, the show's humor had become more risqu√©, causing increasing clashes with station management. Consequently, Shock Theater/Shock Theatre ended its run in March 1985, but Hobart remained a Master Control Operator at WKEF for six more years. Later years In 1986, Filmation's animated cartoon show Ghostbusters featured a character named Doctor Creep in season one, episode 13 \\"A Friend In Need.\\" The character bears a strong resemblance to Barry Hobart's Dr. Creep character with gloves, white face and an old Dutch beard. In 1999, cult film director Andrew Copp and partner, video producer Rick Martin, would resurrect Shock Theater with Dr. Creep at the helm once again for Dayton, Ohio Public-access television. Simply called \\"The New Shock Theater\\", the show aired public domain films mixed with footage of Dr. Creep at Horror conventions and ran periodically through 2005. In 2002, Hobart played Dr. Creep again in Necrophagia: Through Eyes Of The Dead, a collection of music videos and interviews with the rock band Necrophagia and other horror hosts directed by Jim Van Bebber. In 2003 Hobart stepped in front of the camera as a fatherlike spirit in Andrew Copp's film, Black Sun, which built up a cult following. That same year he provided the opening narration for Copp's Freakshow Deluxe, a documentary about a sideshow that pops up around Halloween in Xenia, Ohio, and appeared as himself in the short film Joe Nosferatu: Homeless Vampire, produced by Bob Hinton aka A. Ghastlee Ghoul. Hobart is featured reminiscing about his career as a horror host and the horror host phenomena in John E. Hudgens' 2006 documentary American Scary. Hobart's Dr. Creep inspired an entire generation of Horror Hosts from the Ohio region, such as Baron Von Porkchop (who hosts a similar show on Dayton Access Television), Dr. Freak and A. Ghastlee Ghoul, all of whom credit him as their mentor. In 2011 Dr. Creep was inducted into the first class of The Horror Host Hall Of Fame alongside fellow hosts like Vampira, The Cool Ghoul, Morgus The Magnificent and Sammy Terry to name a few. Charity work As Dr. Creep, Hobart had been an avid supporter of local charities, helping out the MDA during their annual Labor Day telethon. Hobart and Linda Gabbard founded \\"Project Smiles\\", a charity that collects toys every Christmas for needy children in the Dayton area. The charity is still active today. In 1997, Dr. Creep, Andrew Copp and Rick Martin started Horrorama, an all-night film festival held every Halloween to raise funds for Project Smiles. Horrorama originally took place at the Flicker Palace, a now-defunct movie theater in the Dayton suburb of Huber Heights, but moved to another theater in nearby Englewood shortly after. The festival remains active today and is currently held annually in Huber Heights once again. Death Hobart's health began to fail in the last years of his life. Leg and respiratory issues rendered him unable to walk by April 2010. After this point, he used a wheelchair. Hobart continued making appearances as Dr. Creep through the fall. In November, he was guest of honor at the HorrorHound Weekend event in Cincinnati. Hobart lapsed into a coma after a series of massive strokes in December 2010. Complications resulted in Hobart's death at a Dayton hospice on January 14, 2011. He was 69 years old.

The following is a chronologically arranged list of apocryphal stories in the 14th century novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (Sanguo Yanyi), one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature. Although the novel is a romanticised retelling of the history of the late Eastern Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period, due to its widespread popularity, many people believe it to be a real account of the events that happened during that era. The primary historical sources for the Three Kingdoms period is Chen Shou's Records of the Three Kingdoms (Sanguozhi), which includes Annotations to Records of the Three Kingdoms by Pei Songzhi from other historical texts such as Yu Huan's Weil√ºe and the Jiang Biao Zhuan (Ê±üË°®ÂÇ≥). Other sources covering the history of that period include Fan Ye's Book of the Later Han (Houhanshu) and Fang Xuanling's Book of Jin (Jin Shu). Since Sanguo Yanyi is a historical novel, many stories in it are likely dramatised or fabricated, or based on folk tales and historical incidents that happened in other periods of Chinese history. What follows is an incomplete list of the better known of such stories in the novel, each with accompanying text that explains the differences between the story and historical accounts. Oath of the Peach Garden Oath of the Peach Garden, portrait at the Long Corridor of the Summer Palace, Beijing Zhang Fei thrashes the imperial inspector A commandery- level inspector is sent to survey Liu Bei's county after Liu Bei is appointed as a county prefect as a reward for helping to suppress the Yellow Turban Rebellion. The inspector hints to Liu Bei that he wants a bribe, but Liu Bei does not understand the inspector's point. Later, even after his assistant explains to him, Liu Bei still refuses to bribe the inspector. When the inspector is unable to find any fault with Liu Bei's administration, he attempts to intimidate the locals into making false accusations against Liu Bei.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 2. Zhang Fei is furious when he hears about this and he barges into the county office, drags the inspector out, ties him to a post and gives him a severe thrashing. Liu Bei shows up and stops Zhang Fei. When Guan Yu suggests they kill the inspector and seek their fortune elsewhere, Liu Bei refuses, resigns and returns his official seal to the inspector before leaving. ;Historicity The Sanguozhi and the Dianlue recorded that Liu Bei was the one who beat up the inspector. The Han central government had issued an imperial edict to dismiss all officials who received their appointments as rewards for their contributions in battle. Liu Bei knew that he was one of such officials. When a commandery-level inspector was sent to the county to formally dismiss him, Liu Bei sought a private meeting with the inspector. However, the inspector claimed that he was ill and refused to meet Liu Bei. An angry Liu Bei then gathered his men, barged into the inspector's quarters, and falsely announced that he had received a secret order from the commandery administrator to arrest the inspector. He tied the inspector to a tree, took out his official seal and hung it on the inspector's neck, and flogged the inspector over 100 times. He wanted to kill the inspector but eventually released him when the latter pleaded for mercy. He went on the run after that.(Áù£ÈÉµ‰ª•ÂÖ¨‰∫ãÂà∞Á∏£ÔºåÂÖà‰∏ªÊ±ÇË¨ÅÔºå‰∏çÈÄöÔºåÁõ¥ÂÖ•Á∏õÁù£ÈÉµÔºåÊùñ‰∫åÁôæÔºåËß£Á∂¨‰øÇÂÖ∂È†∏ËëóÈ¶¨ÊûäÔºåÊ£ÑÂÆò‰∫°ÂëΩ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 32.(ÂÖ∏Áï•Êõ∞ÔºöÂÖ∂ÂæåÂ∑ûÈÉ°Ë¢´Ë©îÊõ∏ÔºåÂÖ∂ÊúâËªçÂäüÁÇ∫Èï∑ÂêèËÄÖÔºåÁï∂Ê≤ôÊ±∞‰πãÔºåÂÇôÁñëÂú®ÈÅ£‰∏≠„ÄÇÁù£ÈÉµËá≥Á∏£ÔºåÁï∂ÈÅ£ÂÇôÔºåÂÇôÁ¥†Áü•‰πã„ÄÇËÅûÁù£ÈÉµÂú®ÂÇ≥ËàçÔºåÂÇôÊ¨≤Ê±ÇË¶ãÁù£ÈÉµÔºåÁù£ÈÉµÁ®±Áñæ‰∏çËÇØË¶ãÂÇôÔºåÂÇôÊÅ®‰πãÔºåÂõ†ÈÇÑÊ≤ªÔºåÂ∞áÂêèÂçíÊõ¥Ë©£ÂÇ≥ËàçÔºåÁ™ÅÂÖ•ÈñÄÔºåË®Ä„ÄåÊàëË¢´Â∫úÂêõÂØÜÊïôÊî∂Áù£ÈÉµ„Äç„ÄÇÈÅÇÂ∞±Â∫äÁ∏õ‰πãÔºåÂ∞áÂá∫Âà∞ÁïåÔºåËá™Ëß£ÂÖ∂Á∂¨‰ª•Á≥ªÁù£ÈÉµÈ†∏ÔºåÁ∏õ‰πãËëóÊ®πÔºåÈû≠ÊùñÁôæÈ§ò‰∏ãÔºåÊ¨≤ÊÆ∫‰πã„ÄÇÁù£ÈÉµÊ±ÇÂìÄÔºå‰πÉÈáãÂéª‰πã„ÄÇ) Dianlue annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 32. Cao Cao presents a precious sword Cao Cao presents a sword (Â≠üÂæ∑ÁçªÂàÄ), portrait at the Long Corridor of the Summer Palace, Beijing Wang Yun lends Cao Cao his Seven Gems Sword after the latter pledges to assassinate Dong Zhuo. Cao Cao meets Dong Zhuo in his bedroom the following day and attempts to kill him with the sword when he faces away. However, Dong Zhuo sees Cao Cao drawing his sword through a reflection in a mirror and immediately turns back. Cao Cao senses trouble so he quickly kneels down and pretends to present the sword to Dong Zhuo as a gift. At the same time, L√º Bu has returned after Dong Zhuo sent him to choose a new horse for Cao Cao. Cao Cao then lies that he wants to test-ride the new horse and uses the opportunity to escape from Luoyang.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 4. ;Historicity Cao Cao's biography in the Sanguozhi states that Dong Zhuo wanted to appoint Cao Cao as a cavalry colonel (È©çÈ®éÊ†°Â∞â) in his army. Cao Cao refused because he felt that Dong Zhuo was doomed to failure, so he disguised himself and escaped back to his hometown.(ÂçìË°®Â§™Á•ñÁÇ∫È©çÈ®éÊ†°Â∞âÔºåÊ¨≤ËàáË®à‰∫ã„ÄÇÂ§™Á•ñ‰πÉËÆäÊòìÂßìÂêçÔºåÈñìË°åÊù±Ê≠∏„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 1.(È≠èÊõ∏Êõ∞ÔºöÂ§™Á•ñ‰ª•ÂçìÁµÇÂøÖË¶ÜÊïóÔºåÈÅÇ‰∏çÂ∞±ÊãúÔºåÈÄÉÊ≠∏ÈÑâÈáå„ÄÇ) Wei Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 1. There is no mention of Cao Cao attempting to assassinate Dong Zhuo before his escape. Cao Cao arrested and released by Chen Gong Cao Cao flees from the capital, Luoyang, after failing to assassinate Dong Zhuo. Dong Zhuo orders notices for Cao Cao's arrest to be put around the areas surrounding Luoyang. During his escape, Cao Cao is spotted in Zhongmu County by the county prefect, Chen Gong, who arrests him. Chen Gong has a private conversation with Cao Cao and decides to release him after feeling inspired by his sense of righteousness. Chen Gong even gives up his official post and becomes Cao Cao's companion.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 5. ;Historicity The Sanguozhi recorded that when Cao Cao passed by Zhongmu County, a patrol officer suspected that he was a fugitive and arrested him. However, Cao Cao was released later after another official recognised him.(Âá∫ÈóúÔºåÈÅé‰∏≠ÁâüÔºåÁÇ∫‰∫≠Èï∑ÊâÄÁñëÔºåÂü∑Ë©£Á∏£ÔºåÈÇë‰∏≠ÊàñÁ´äË≠ò‰πãÔºåÁÇ∫Ë´ãÂæóËß£„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 1.(‰∏ñË™ûÊõ∞Ôºö‰∏≠ÁâüÁñëÊòØ‰∫°‰∫∫ÔºåË¶ãÊãòÊñºÁ∏£„ÄÇÊôÇÊéæ‰∫¶Â∑≤Ë¢´ÂçìÊõ∏ÔºõÂîØÂäüÊõπÂøÉÁü•ÊòØÂ§™Á•ñÔºå‰ª•‰∏ñÊñπ‰∫ÇÔºå‰∏çÂÆúÊãòÂ§©‰∏ãÈõÑ‰øäÔºåÂõ†ÁôΩ‰ª§Èáã‰πã„ÄÇ) Shiyu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 1. There is no evidence that Cao Cao attempted to assassinate Dong Zhuo before his arrest and the patrol officer's name is not recorded in history. Besides, in Cao Cao's biography, Chen Gong is first mentioned only after Liu Dai's death in 192 when he urged Cao Cao to assume governorship of Yan Province (covering present-day southwestern Shandong and eastern Henan).(‰∏ñË™ûÊõ∞ÔºöÂ≤±Êó¢Ê≠ªÔºåÈô≥ÂÆÆË¨ÇÂ§™Á•ñÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂ∑û‰ªäÁÑ°‰∏ªÔºåËÄåÁéãÂëΩÊñ∑ÁµïÔºåÂÆÆË´ãË™™Â∑û‰∏≠ÔºåÊòéÂ∫úÂ∞ãÂæÄÁâß‰πãÔºåË≥á‰πã‰ª•Êî∂Â§©‰∏ãÔºåÊ≠§Èú∏Áéã‰πãÊ•≠‰πü„ÄÇ„ÄçÂÆÆË™™Âà•Èßï„ÄÅÊ≤ª‰∏≠Êõ∞Ôºö„Äå‰ªäÂ§©‰∏ãÂàÜË£ÇËÄåÂ∑ûÁÑ°‰∏ªÔºõÊõπÊù±ÈÉ°ÔºåÂëΩ‰∏ñ‰πãÊâç‰πüÔºåËã•Ëøé‰ª•ÁâßÂ∑ûÔºåÂøÖÂØßÁîüÊ∞ë„ÄÇ„ÄçÈÆë‰ø°Á≠â‰∫¶Ë¨Ç‰πãÁÑ∂„ÄÇ‰ø°‰πÉËàáÂ∑ûÂêèËê¨ÊΩõÁ≠âËá≥Êù±ÈÉ°ËøéÂ§™Á•ñÈ†òÂÖóÂ∑ûÁâß„ÄÇ) Shiyu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 1. This happened two years after the Campaign against Dong Zhuo started in 190. As such, it contradicts the story in Sanguo Yanyi because, in the novel, Cao Cao launches the campaign only after he kills L√º Boshe in Chen Gong's presence (see the article on L√º Boshe) and returns to his hometown in Chenliu (Èô≥Áïô; in present-day Kaifeng, Henan). Cao Cao murders L√º Boshe Guan Yu slays Hua Xiong  In Chapter 5, as warlords from the east of Hangu Pass form a coalition against Dong Zhuo, Hua Xiong stations at Sishui Pass to ward off the oncoming attack. When L√º Bu requests to lead troops to attack the enemy, Hua Xiong steps in and says, \\"An ox-cleaver to kill a chicken! There is no need for the General to go. I will cut off their heads as easily as I would take a thing out of my pocket!\\" Dong Zhuo then puts Hua Xiong in charge. Having single-handedly slain four warriors from the coalition - Zu Mao (Á•ñËåÇ), Pan Feng (ÊΩòÈ≥≥), Bao Zhong (ÈÆëÂø†), and Yu She (‰øûÊ∂â) - Hua Xiong seems invincible. Despite mistrust from many warlords of the coalition, most notably their leader Yuan Shao, Guan Yu volunteers to fight Hua Xiong. To convince them to give him the opportunity, he tells them that if he fails to defeat Hua Xiong, the coalition can take his head as punishment. When Cao Cao pours Guan Yu a cup of warm wine, Guan Yu puts it on hold and says he will return very soon victorious. As promised, Guan Yu returns quickly with Hua Xiong's head, whilst Cao Cao who was still holding the cup of wine, realised just how quickly it took Guan Yu to slay the notorious General Hua Xiong. Cao Cao then gives the cup of wine - still warm - to Guan Yu who gulps down the wine victoriously. This is known as (Ê∫´ÈÖíÊñ¨ËèØÈõÑ), which roughly translates to 'Slaying Hua Xiong over a warm wine'. In recorded history, Hua Xiong was defeated and killed in a battle at Yangren (ÈôΩ‰∫∫; believed to be near present- day Wenquan, Ruzhou, Henan) against Sun Jian. Battle of Hulao Pass In 190, Dong Zhuo entered Luoyang, the capital of the Eastern Han dynasty, and took control of the imperial court. Dong Zhuo monopolised state power and governed with cruelty and brutality. Later that year, several warlords and regional officials formed a new coalition against Dong Zhuo, with Yuan Shao as their leader. The coalition first attacked Sishui Pass, one of the mountain passes on the way to Luoyang. Dong Zhuo's general Hua Xiong, who was guarding Sishui Pass, was slain by Guan Yu from the coalition, and the pass was captured by the coalition. The coalition forces then marched on to Hulao Pass, situated some 50 li away from Luoyang. Dong Zhuo personally led an army of 150,000 men with L√º Bu, Li Ru, Fan Chou, and Zhang Ji east to Hulao Pass, while sending 50,000 men under Li Jue and Guo Si to reinforce Sishui Pass. Once at Hulao Pass, Dong Zhuo ordered L√º Bu to lead the vanguard with 30,000 men and set camp in front of the fortified pass. The coalition decided to send half of their forces to engage Dong Zhuo's forces. Eight coalition warlords‚ÄîWang Kuang, Qiao Mao, Bao Xin, Yuan Yi, Kong Rong, Zhang Yang, Tao Qian, and Gongsun Zan‚Äîeach led their forces towards Hulao Pass under Yuan Shao's command. The first to arrive in Hulao Pass was Wang Kuang, where one of his generals, Fang Yue, volunteered to duel L√º Bu. In less than five rounds, Fang Yue was killed, and L√º Bu charged through Wang Kuang's force, killing several of the routing soldiers. The forces of Qiao Mao and Yuan Yi came to Wang Kuang's rescue. They decided to withdraw 30 li from the pass and set camp there. Soon, the remaining five coalition warlords arrived at the camp, where they discussed and concluded that L√º Bu cannot be defeated by anyone. Just then, L√º Bu's men arrayed outside the coalition camp, and the eight coalition warlords went to meet the enemy. Mu Shun, a general under Zhang Yang, charged towards L√º Bu, but was immediately killed. Wu Anguo, a general under Kong Rong, then proceeded to challenge L√º Bu. They fought for ten rounds, but then L√º Bu slit off Wu Anguo's wrist with his ji. The coalition forces charged out and rescued Wu Anguo, and each side retreated to their own camps. Cao Cao commented that all the eighteen warlords must gather together to discuss a plan to defeat L√º Bu, and that if L√º Bu is defeated, Dong Zhuo would be easy to kill. Just then, L√º Bu came out again to taunt the coalition. This time, Gongsun Zan went to challenge L√º Bu, but had to withdraw after a few rounds. L√º Bu gave chase, but he was distracted by Zhang Fei, who called him \\"a slave with three surnames\\" (‰∏âÂßìÂÆ∂Â•¥; the \\"three surnames\\" refer to L√º Bu's original surname and those of his two foster fathers). L√º Bu then battled Zhang Fei for 50 rounds, with neither gaining an advantage over the other. Following that, Guan Yu, brandishing his Green Dragon Crescent Blade, dashed out to assist Zhang Fei. The three fighters were engaged in another 30 bouts or so when Liu Bei, holding up a pair of swords, also joined in the fray. The three sworn brothers encircled L√º Bu and took turns to attack him from different directions. L√º Bu was unable to defeat all three opponents so he pretended to attack Liu Bei and escaped through the gap when Liu dodged his attack. L√º Bu then fled back to Hulao Pass, with the three brothers hot on pursuit, but they could not catch up with him because of the speed of his horse, the Red Hare. They abandoned the chase after they spotted Dong Zhuo. Zhang Fei attempted to charge onto the fortification to kill Dong Zhuo, but was driven back by a rain of arrows from the pass. The coalition warlords declared the battle won, and received Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei for a celebration of their victory. Historicity There is no historical record of any engagement taking place at Hulao Pass during that period of time. In the novel, Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei participated in the campaign under Gongsun Zan's banner, but the Sanguozhi did not mention Gongsun Zan's involvement in the campaign. Historically, however, there were confrontations between the coalition and Dong Zhuo in which both Dong Zhuo and L√º Bu had participated in personally, with only Sun Jian's forces present on the coalition side. Dong Zhuo's biography in the Book of the Later Han (Houhanshu) stated that L√º Bu was defeated in battle twice by Sun Jian: * The first time was at Yangren (ÈôΩ‰∫∫; believed to be near present-day Wenquan, Ruzhou, Henan), when Dong Zhuo sent L√º Bu and Hu Zhen to attack Sun Jian. L√º Bu and Hu Zhen could not get along with each other, leading to disorder in their army, so Sun Jian used the opportunity to attack them and forced them to retreat.(ÊòéÂπ¥ÔºåÂ≠´Â†ÖÊî∂ÂêàÊï£ÂçíÔºåÈÄ≤Â±ØÊ¢ÅÁ∏£‰πãÈôΩ‰∫∫„ÄÇÂçìÈÅ£Â∞áËÉ°Ëª´„ÄÅÂëÇÂ∏ÉÊîª‰πãÔºåÂ∏ÉËàáËª´‰∏çÁõ∏ËÉΩÔºåËªç‰∏≠Ëá™È©öÊÅêÔºåÂ£´ÂçíÊï£‰∫Ç„ÄÇÂ†ÖËøΩÊìä‰πãÔºåËª´„ÄÅÂ∏ÉÊïóËµ∞„ÄÇ) Houhanshu vol. 72.(Â≠´Â†ÖÁßªÂ±ØÊ¢ÅÊù±ÔºåÁÇ∫ÂçìÂ∞áÂæêÊ¶ÆÊâÄÊïóÔºåÂæ©Êî∂Êï£ÂçíÈÄ≤Â±ØÈôΩ‰∫∫„ÄÇÂçìÈÅ£Êù±ÈÉ°Â§™ÂÆàËÉ°Ëª´Áù£Ê≠•È®é‰∫îÂçÉÊìä‰πãÔºå‰ª•ÂëÇÂ∏ÉÁÇ∫È®éÁù£„ÄÇËª´ËàáÂ∏É‰∏çÁõ∏ÂæóÔºåÂ†ÖÂá∫ÊìäÔºåÂ§ßÁ†¥‰πãÔºåÊ¢üÂÖ∂ÈÉΩÁù£ËèØÈõÑ„ÄÇ) Zizhi Tongjian vol. 60. * The second time was in Luoyang, where Dong Zhuo personally led an army to engage Sun Jian's forces in the area where the tombs of the Han emperors were located.

There is no historical evidence to support the maid's name being \\"Diaochan\\". That name likely referred to the sable (Ë≤Ç; diao) tails and jade decorations in the shape of cicadas (Ëü¨; chan), which at the time adorned the headgear of high-ranking government officials. Battle of Xiapi Guan Yu's three conditions Cao Cao and Liu Bei join forces to attack L√º Bu in Xu Province (covering parts of present-day Shandong and Jiangsu) and defeat him at the Battle of Xiapi. Cao Cao appoints Che Zhou (ËªäÂÜë) as the governor of Xu Province. Liu Bei later breaks ties with Cao Cao and seizes control of Xu Province after Guan Yu kills Che Zhou. Cao Cao leads an army to attack Liu Bei and take back Xu Province. In one battle, Liu Bei and Zhang Fei lead a force to attack Cao Cao's camp but fall into an ambush and are separated during the chaos. Guan Yu, who remained behind to defend Xiapi (Xu Province's capital), is lured out of the city and isolated on a small hill. Cao Cao's forces take control of Xiapi and capture Liu Bei's spouses. Cao Cao sends Zhang Liao to ask Guan Yu to surrender. Guan Yu agrees to surrender, provided the following three conditions are fulfilled: # Liu Bei's spouses are not harmed and are treated well. # In name, Guan Yu surrenders to the emperor and not to Cao Cao. # Guan Yu is allowed to leave and reunite with Liu Bei as soon as he has news of Liu Bei's whereabouts. Cao Cao agrees to the three conditions. Guan Yu serves under him temporarily before leaving to rejoin Liu Bei later.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 24-25. ;Historicity Guan Yu's biography in the Sanguozhi states that Liu Bei launched a surprise attack on Xu Province and killed Che Zhou. He then placed Guan Yu in charge of Xiapi while he moved to Xiaopei. In 200, Cao Cao led an army east to attack Liu Bei and defeated him. Liu Bei fled to join Yuan Shao. Guan Yu was captured by Cao Cao's forces and brought back to Xuchang, where Cao appointed him as a lieutenant-general (ÂÅèÂ∞áËªç) and treated him well.(ÂÖà‰∏ª‰πãË•≤ÊÆ∫ÂæêÂ∑ûÂà∫Âè≤ËªäËÉÑÔºå‰ΩøÁæΩÂÆà‰∏ãÈÇ≥ÂüéÔºåË°åÂ§™ÂÆà‰∫ãÔºåËÄåË∫´ÈÇÑÂ∞èÊ≤õ„ÄÇÂª∫ÂÆâ‰∫îÂπ¥ÔºåÊõπÂÖ¨Êù±ÂæµÔºåÂÖà‰∏ªÂ•îË¢ÅÁ¥π„ÄÇÊõπÂÖ¨Á¶ΩÁæΩ‰ª•Ê≠∏ÔºåÊãúÁÇ∫ÂÅèÂ∞áËªçÔºåÁ¶Æ‰πãÁîöÂéö„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 36. There is no mention of Guan Yu surrendering nor any conditions named by Guan before he agreed to surrender. Guan Yu slays Yan Liang and Wen Chou Before the Battle of Guandu between Yuan Shao and Cao Cao, both sides have already engaged in two skirmishes: the Battle of Boma and Battle of Yan Ford. Yuan Shao sends his generals Yan Liang and Wen Chou to attack Cao Cao's fortress at Boma (ÁôΩÈ¶¨; near present-day Hua County, Henan). During the battle, some of Cao Cao's best warriors, including Xu Huang and Zhang Liao, go forth to take up Yan Liang's challenge but are defeated by him. Cao Cao reluctantly allows Guan Yu to fight Yan Liang and Guan emerges victorious. Wen Chou later comes to avenge Yan Liang but ends up being slain by Guan Yu in a rout. The siege on Boma is lifted as a result.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 25-26. ;Historicity Guan Yu's biography in the Sanguozhi mentions that Yuan Shao ordered Yan Liang to besiege Cao Cao's general Liu Yan (ÂäâÂª∂) at Boma. Cao Cao then sent Zhang Liao and Guan Yu to lead the vanguard force to attack Yan Liang. During the battle, Guan Yu spotted Yan Liang and charged through enemy lines towards him, killed him and took his head. Yuan Shao's other generals were unable to resist the assault and the siege on Boma was thus lifted.(Á¥πÈÅ£Â§ßÂ∞áËªçÈ°èËâØÊîªÊù±ÈÉ°Â§™ÂÆàÂäâÂª∂ÊñºÁôΩÈ¶¨ÔºåÊõπÂÖ¨‰ΩøÂºµÈÅºÂèäÁæΩÁÇ∫ÂÖàÈãíÊìä‰πã„ÄÇÁæΩÊúõË¶ãËâØÈ∫æËìãÔºåÁ≠ñÈ¶¨Âà∫ËâØÊñºËê¨Áúæ‰πã‰∏≠ÔºåÊñ¨ÂÖ∂È¶ñÈÇÑÔºåÁ¥πË´∏Â∞áËé´ËÉΩÁï∂ËÄÖÔºåÈÅÇËß£ÁôΩÈ¶¨Âúç„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 36.

Guan Yu crosses five passes and slays six generals A mural of Guan Yu's \\"Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles\\" (ÂçÉÈáåËµ∞ÂñÆÈ®é) in the Summer Palace, Beijing. Guan Yu slays Bian Xi, portrait at the Long Corridor of the Summer Palace, Beijing A Qing dynasty illustration of the monk Pujing. Guan Yu receives news that Liu Bei is alive and currently in Yuan Shao's camp. He decides to leave Cao Cao with Liu Bei's wives to rejoin his sworn brother. He tries to bid Cao Cao farewell personally before leaving, but Cao Cao does not give him the chance to do so. Frustrated, Guan Yu eventually writes a farewell letter to Cao Cao and leaves. He takes with him none of the luxuries and gifts Cao Cao gave him, except the Red Hare. He even gives up his peerage (Marquis of Hanshou Village) and leaves his official seal behind. Cao Cao's subordinates feel that Guan Yu is rude and arrogant because he left without bidding farewell, so they ask for permission to pursue him, capture him and bring him back. Cao Cao disapproves because he knows that none of them can stop Guan Yu, and he gives orders for the officials along the way to give passage to Guan Yu and his companions. Guan Yu rides beside the carriage carrying Liu Bei's wives and escorts them along the way. The first pass they reach is Dongling Pass (south of present- day Dengfeng, Henan). Kong Xiu, the officer guarding the pass, denies Guan Yu passage because Guan Yu does not have an exit permit with him. Guan Yu then kills Kong Xiu and forces his way through the pass. They reach the city of Luoyang next. The governor Han Fu leads 1,000 men to block Guan Yu. Han Fu's deputy Meng Tan challenges Guan Yu to a duel but ends up being sliced in two. While Guan Yu is fighting with Meng Tan, Han Fu secretly takes aim and fires an arrow at Guan. The arrow hits Guan Yu's arm and wounds him, but Guan Yu pulls out the arrow from his wound, charges towards Han Fu and kills him. The shocked soldiers immediately give way and Guan Yu's party passes through safely. Guan Yu's party arrives at Sishui Pass (north of present-day Xingyang, Henan). Bian Xi, the officer guarding the pass, receives them warmly and invites Guan Yu to a feast at the temple outside the pass. In fact, Bian Xi had ordered 200 men to wait in ambush inside the temple and kill Guan Yu when he gives a signal. Pujing, an elderly monk from the same hometown as Guan Yu, subtly warns Guan Yu about Bian Xi's plot. Guan Yu senses the danger, kills Bian Xi and passes through Sishui Pass safely. Wang Zhi, the governor of Xingyang, adopts a similar scheme to kill Guan Yu. Like Bian Xi, he pretends to welcome Guan Yu and leads them to a courier station, where they will stay that night. After that, Wang Zhi orders his subordinate Hu Ban to lead 1,000 men to surround the station and set it on fire in the middle of the night. Curious to know what Guan Yu looks like, Hu Ban sneaks in and peeps at Guan Yu, who is reading inside his room. Guan Yu notices Hu Ban and invites him in. Guan Yu met Hu Ban's father earlier and has with him a letter from Hu Ban's father addressed to his son. He gives the letter to Hu Ban. After reading his father's letter, Hu Ban changes his mind and decides to help Guan Yu. He reveals Wang Zhi's plot to Guan Yu and secretly opens the city gates for Guan Yu and his companions to leave. Wang Zhi and his soldiers catch up with them a while later but Guan Yu turns back and kills him. Guan Yu's party finally arrives at a ferry crossing on the southern bank of the Yellow River. Qin Qi, the officer in charge, refuses to allow them to cross the river and is killed by Guan Yu in anger. Guan Yu and his party then cross the river safely and enter Yuan Shao's territory. However, they soon realise that Liu Bei is no longer with Yuan Shao and has already left for Runan. Guan Yu and his party then make their way back and are finally reunited with Liu Bei and Zhang Fei at Gucheng. During this journey, Guan Yu meets many men who would become his subordinates and remain loyal to him until his death. They include Liao Hua, Zhou Cang and Guan Ping (whom he adopts as his son).Sanguo Yanyi ch. 26-28. ;Historicity Guan Yu's biography in the Sanguozhi provides a similar account of the reasons for Guan Yu's departure and the events that happened before he left Cao Cao.(ÂàùÔºåÊõπÂÖ¨Â£ØÁæΩÁÇ∫‰∫∫Ôºå ...

Both of them are locked in a duel when Cai Yang (Ëî°ÈôΩ), an officer under Cao Cao, leads his soldiers to attack them.

Portrait at the Long Corridor of the Summer Palace, Beijing Before leaving for Xuchang, Xu Shu recommends Zhuge Liang to Liu Bei and tells him that he needs to recruit Zhuge Liang personally. Accompanied by Guan Yu and Zhang Fei, Liu Bei travels to Longzhong (in present-day Xiangyang, Hubei) to find Zhuge Liang. They arrive at Zhuge Liang's house (described to be a \\"thatched cottage\\"), where a servant tells them that his master is not at home. Liu Bei then asks the servant to pass a message to Zhuge Liang that Liu Bei came to visit him. Several days later, in winter, Liu Bei brings his sworn brothers along with him to visit Zhuge Liang again. This time, the servant leads Liu Bei to his \\"master\\", who turns out to be Zhuge Liang's younger brother, Zhuge Jun. Just as he is about to leave, Liu Bei sees a man approaching and thinks he must be Zhuge Liang, but he turns out to be Zhuge Liang's father-in-law, Huang Chengyan. When winter is over and spring comes, Liu Bei decides to visit Zhuge Liang again, much to the annoyance of his sworn brothers. This time, Zhuge Liang is at home but is asleep. Liu Bei waits patiently until Zhuge Liang wakes up. Zhuge Liang drafts the Longzhong Plan for Liu Bei and agrees to leave home and serve Liu Bei as his strategist.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 37-38. ;Historicity There are no details in the Sanguozhi about how Liu Bei recruited Zhuge Liang.

Both Zhuge Liang and Liu Bei did not know each other at first when the former came to visit the latter. Liu Bei did not pay much attention to Zhuge Liang because he thought that Zhuge Liang was just a typical young scholar. Zhuge Liang remained behind after Liu Bei's other guests left the meeting. Liu Bei did not ask him if he had something to say and continued playing with a gift from one of the guests. Zhuge Liang initiated a conversation with Liu Bei.

Battle of Bowang Battle of Changban Zhuge Liang's mission to Jiangdong Before the Battle of Red Cliffs, Zhuge Liang goes to Jiangdong on a mission to discuss the formation of an alliance between Liu Bei and Sun Quan (i.e. a Sun‚ÄìLiu alliance) to counter Cao Cao. Lu Su introduces Zhuge Liang to the civil officials and scholars serving under Sun Quan. Most of them are in favour of surrendering to Cao Cao. They start debating. Zhuge Liang manages to silence those who challenge him through his eloquent responses to their queries and comments. Insults and taunts are exchanged as well. The officials and scholars who debate with Zhuge Liang include Zhang Zhao, Yu Fan, Bu Zhi, Xue Zong, Lu Ji, Yan Jun and Cheng Bing. Zhang Wen and Luo Tong also want to challenge Zhuge Liang, but Huang Gai shows up and stops the debate.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 43. Lu Su then introduces Zhuge Liang to Zhou Yu. Zhuge Liang, Zhou Yu and Lu Su then have a conversation in Zhou Yu's house. Zhuge Liang says he has a plan to make Cao Cao to retreat without fighting a war: send Cao Cao the Two Qiaos. He also pretends that he does not know whom the Qiao sisters married. When Zhou Yu asks Zhuge Liang for evidence that Cao Cao wants the Two Qiaos, Zhuge Liang says he heard that Cao Cao asked his son Cao Zhi to write a poem, \\"Ode to the Bronze Sparrow Platform\\" (ÈäÖÈõÄËá∫Ë≥¶). Zhuge Liang recites the poem and points out that Cao Cao's desire to have the Qiaos is evident in the poem. An enraged Zhou Yu hardens his decision to go to war with Cao Cao.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 44. ;Historicity The debate between Zhuge Liang and the scholars is not mentioned in any of the involved parties' biographies in the Sanguozhi.

Besides, the poem in Sanguo Yanyi contains seven additional lines which are not present in the historical version recorded in Cao Zhi's biography in the Sanguozhi. to the Bronze Sparrow Platform on Chinese Wikisource.

Zhou Yu tricks Jiang Gan Borrowing arrows with straw boats Borrowing arrows with straw boats (ËçâËàπÂÄüÁÆ≠), portrait at the Long Corridor of the Summer Palace, Beijing Zhou Yu feels jealous of Zhuge Liang's talent and foresees that he will become a threat to Sun Quan in the future, so he tries to think of ways to kill Zhuge Liang. When he asks Zhuge Liang to help him produce 100,000 arrows within 10 days, the latter says he can complete the task in three days. Zhou Yu then asks Zhuge Liang if he is willing to make a pledge to complete the task. Under the pledge, if Zhuge Liang fails to produce 100,000 arrows in three days, he will be executed for his failure. When Zhuge Liang agrees and takes the pledge, Zhou Yu secretly feels delighted because he thinks that Zhuge Liang cannot complete the task in time. On the third day, with help from Lu Su, Zhuge Liang prepares 20 large boats, each manned by a few soldiers and filled with human-like figures made of straw and hay. In the hours before dawn, when there is a great fog, Zhuge Liang deploys the boats and sails towards Cao Cao's camp across the river. He orders the sailors to beat war drums loudly and shout orders to imitate the sounds of an attack. Upon hearing the noises, Cao Cao's troops rush out to engage the enemy but they are unsure of the enemy force's size because their vision is obscured by the fog. They fire volleys of arrows in the direction of the noises and the arrows become stuck in the straw figures. In the meantime, Zhuge Liang enjoys drinks with Lu Su inside the cabin and they sail back when the fog clears. By the time they return to base, Zhuge Liang has acquired more than 100,000 arrows, so Zhou Yu cannot execute him.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 46. ;Historicity This event is not documented in the Sanguozhi and is purely fiction. However, the Weil√ºe mentions a similar incident during the Battle of Ruxu in 213. Sun Quan sailed on a large vessel to observe Cao Cao's base. Cao Cao ordered his archers to fire arrows at Sun Quan's ship. The arrows were stuck to one side of the vessel and the ship was on the verge of overturning due to the weight of the arrows.

When he sees the wind blowing from the northwest, he coughs blood, faints and falls sick. Zhuge Liang visits him and points out the root cause of his sudden illness ‚Äì his worries about the direction of the wind. He claims that he can change the direction of the winds in their favour through a ritual. Zhou Yu then orders his men to set up an altar according to Zhuge Liang's instructions; Zhuge Liang performs a ritual on the altar for three days and three nights. On the third night, the wind changes direction and starts blowing from the southeast. Zhuge Liang leaves immediately as he knows that Zhou Yu will send his men to kill him. As Zhuge Liang foresaw, Zhou Yu sends Ding Feng and Xu Sheng to execute him, but he has already fled on a boat captained by Zhao Yun.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 49.

From a Peking opera performance by Shanghai Jingju Theatre Company on January 17, 2015, in Tianchan Theatre, Shanghai, China. Guan Yu is sent to guard Huarong Trail (believed to be near present-day Dongshan Town, Huarong County, Hunan) and intercept Cao Cao when he passes by after his defeat at the Battle of Red Cliffs. Zhuge Liang is initially reluctant to allow Guan Yu to take up the task because he is worried that Guan might consider the kindness Cao Cao showed towards him many years ago and end up releasing Cao Cao. Guan Yu insists on accepting the mission and claims he has already repaid Cao Cao's kindness by slaying Yan Liang and Wen Chou and lifting the siege on Boma. He makes a pledge to not let Cao Cao off; Zhuge Liang also makes a pledge that he will give his head to Guan Yu if Cao Cao does not show up at Huarong Trail. As Zhuge Liang predicted, Cao Cao reaches Huarong Trail and encounters Guan Yu there. However, Guan Yu decides to spare Cao Cao in consideration of their past dealings, and after taking pity on the plight of Cao Cao's men and Zhang Liao, whom he saved from death at the Battle of Xiapi. He allows Cao Cao and his men to pass through Huarong Trail unharmed. When he returns to camp, he confesses the truth to Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang. Zhuge Liang orders Guan Yu to be executed for failing in his mission but pardons him when Liu Bei intervenes.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 50-51. ;Historicity This incident is not mentioned in the Sanguozhi and is entirely fiction. The Shanyang Gong Zaiji (Â±±ÈôΩÂÖ¨ËºâË®ò) states that after Cao Cao lost the Battle of Red Cliffs, he retreated with his surviving men and passed by Huarong Trail. The path was muddy and difficult to access, so Cao Cao ordered the weaker soldiers to lay the ground with straw and hay so that his horsemen can pass. Many of those weaker soldiers were trampled to death when they became stuck in the mud. When Cao Cao finally got out of the dire situation, he expressed joy so his generals asked him why he was happy. Cao Cao replied, \\"Liu Bei, he's my mate.

Taishi Ci's death Battle of Changsha The Battle of Changsha, also called the Changsha Conflict is a fictional military skirmish described in Chapter 53 of the 14th- century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms that took place in Changsha, in Jing Province, between the warlords Liu Bei and Han Xuan. The battle introduces two major Shu Han generals, Huang Zhong and Wei Yan. Han Xuan, a former subordinate of Liu Biao, controlled the city of Changsha following Liu Biao's death in 208 and Liu Cong's failed succession. Han Xuan and another warlord Jin Xuan seceded from Jing Province following Cao Cao's stalemated conquest of Jing Province Cao Cao, Liu Bei, and Sun Quan all desired Jing Province, and Sun Quan had little of the province except for the southern side of the Yangtze near Xiakou and Chibi. Finding an opportunity to take Jing Province and a few other important locations, Liu Bei dispatched Guan Yu to take Changsha and eliminate Han Xuan. Wei Yan (left) approaches Huang Zhong, who awaits execution. From a 2019 Shao opera performance in Shaoxing. When Guan Yu led his forces towards Changsha, Han Xuan sent his general Yang Ling to meet the enemy, but Yang Ling was killed. Han Xuan then sent Huang Zhong, who fought with Guan Yu. Whilst fighting, both generals developed respect for each other, and did not take opportunities to slay the other. Han Xuan saw this, and ordered Huang Zhong to be put to death. Wei Yan rescued Huang Zhong by cutting down the executioner, then led a revolt to kill Han Xuan. Wei Yan then surrendered the city to Guan Yu. Huang Zhong, Wei Yan and Liu Pan would all become prominent people of Shu Han following their surrenders to Liu Bei. Huang Zhong would become a \\"Tiger general\\" along with Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun, and Ma Chao. He would fight in the Hanzhong Campaign and kill Xiahou Yuan during a clash with Cao Cao's forces at Battle of Mt. Dingjun. Liu Pan would become the magistrate of Changsha for the Shu kingdom. When Wei Yan surrendered, Zhuge Liang ordered him to be executed, but Liu Bei intervened. Zhuge Liang would always suspect Wei Yan, fearing he would again revolt. Indeed, later in Chapter 104, after Zhuge Liang's death in the Battle of Wuzhang Plains, Wei Yan does revolt.  Historicity  Historically, Han Xuan surrendered to Liu Bei as part of the Battle of Jiangling in 208 without conflict, and Wei Yan was one of Liu Bei's personal retainers and rose through the ranks to become a general; he had nothing to do with Han Xuan and Huang Zhong. Liu Bei and Lady Sun's marriage Zhou Yu suggests the \\"beauty scheme\\" (Áæé‰∫∫Ë®à) to Sun Quan to seize control of Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan) from Liu Bei. In the plan, Sun Quan sends L√º Fan to lure Liu Bei to his territory under the pretext of marrying Sun Quan's sister, Lady Sun, to strengthen the Sun‚ÄìLiu alliance. Once Liu Bei arrives, Sun Quan will then hold him hostage in exchange for Jing Province. However, Zhuge Liang foils Zhou Yu's plan, and Liu Bei ends up marrying Lady Sun for real. Liu Bei also manages to leave Sun Quan's territory with his bride and return to Jing Province safely. When Zhou Yu leads his troops in pursuit of Liu Bei, he falls into an ambush by Liu Bei's forces. Liu Bei's men chant: \\"(Zhou Yu)'s brilliant strategy brings peace to the world. He lost both the Lady and his soldiers.\\" (Âë®ÈÉéÂ¶ôË®àÂÆâÂ§©‰∏ãÔºåË≥†‰∫ÜÂ§´‰∫∫ÂèàÊäòÂÖµÔºÅ) Zhou Yu coughs blood and faints.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 54-55. ;Historicity The marriage between Liu Bei and Lady Sun is mentioned in Liu Bei's biography in the Sanguozhi as follows: After Liu Qi died of illness, Liu Bei's subordinates urged him to become the new governor of Jing Province and set up the provincial capital at Gong'an County. Sun Quan felt slightly uneasy so he married his younger sister to Liu Bei to strengthen relations between him and Liu Bei.(Áê¶ÁóÖÊ≠ªÔºåÁæ§‰∏ãÊé®ÂÖà‰∏ªÁÇ∫ËçäÂ∑ûÁâßÔºåÊ≤ªÂÖ¨ÂÆâ„ÄÇÊ¨äÁ®çÁïè‰πãÔºåÈÄ≤Â¶πÂõ∫Â•Ω„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 32. This suggests that the marriage took place in Gong'an County, as Sun Quan sent his sister there to marry Liu Bei, instead of Liu Bei travelling to Sun Quan's territory for the marriage. However, Zhou Yu's biography mentions that Zhou Yu suggested to Sun Quan to have Liu Bei confined in their territory. After Liu Bei assumed governorship of Jing Province, he went to Jing (‰∫¨; present-day Zhenjiang, Jiangsu) to meet Sun Quan. At the time, Zhou Yu told Sun Quan, \\"Liu Bei possesses characteristics of a fierce and ambitious hero. Besides, he also has under him generals with the might of bears and tigers, such as Guan Yu and Zhang Fei. He's definitely not someone who will remain subservient to another lord. I suggest moving Liu Bei to Wu (Âê≥; in present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu), build a palace for him there, and present him with women and gifts to entertain him. We'll then put the two men (Guan Yu and Zhang Fei) each in a different location. If I can use Liu Bei as a hostage and attack (his men) at the same time, our goal (take over Jing Province) will be accomplished. And now yet we carve out land for them as resources, and allow the three men to be together? I'm afraid once the dragon encounters clouds and rain, it'll no longer remain in a pond.\\" Sun Quan considered that Cao Cao was still a threat in the north, so he thought it would be better for him to have more allies (instead of creating hostility between him and his allies). He was also worried that Liu Bei's men might not submit to him, so he rejected Zhou Yu's idea.(ÂäâÂÇô‰ª•Â∑¶Â∞áËªçÈ†òËçäÂ∑ûÁâßÔºåÊ≤ªÂÖ¨ÂÆâÔºåÂÇôË©£‰∫¨Ë¶ãÊ¨äÔºåÁëú‰∏äÁñèÊõ∞Ôºö\\"ÂäâÂÇô‰ª•Ê¢üÈõÑ‰πãÂßøÔºåËÄåÊúâÈóúÁæΩ„ÄÅÂºµÈ£õÁÜäËôé‰πãÂ∞áÔºåÂøÖÈùû‰πÖÂ±àÁÇ∫‰∫∫Áî®ËÄÖ„ÄÇÊÑöË¨ÇÂ§ßË®àÂÆúÂæôÂÇôÁΩÆÂê≥ÔºåÁõõÁÇ∫ÁØâÂÆÆÂÆ§ÔºåÂ§öÂÖ∂ÁæéÂ•≥Áé©Â•ΩÔºå‰ª•Â®õÂÖ∂ËÄ≥ÁõÆÔºåÂàÜÊ≠§‰∫å‰∫∫ÔºåÂêÑÁΩÆ‰∏ÄÊñπÔºå‰ΩøÂ¶ÇÁëúËÄÖÂæóÊåæËàáÊîªÊà∞ÔºåÂ§ß‰∫ãÂèØÂÆö‰πü„ÄÇ‰ªäÁå•Ââ≤ÂúüÂú∞‰ª•Ë≥áÊ•≠‰πãÔºåËÅöÊ≠§‰∏â‰∫∫Ôºå‰ø±Âú®ÁñÜÂ†¥ÔºåÊÅêËõüÈæçÂæóÈõ≤Èõ®ÔºåÁµÇÈùûÊ±†‰∏≠Áâ©‰πü„ÄÇ\\"Ê¨ä‰ª•ÊõπÂÖ¨Âú®ÂåóÊñπÔºåÁï∂Âª£Êî¨Ëã±ÈõÑÔºåÂèàÊÅêÂÇôÈõ£ÂçíÂà∂ÔºåÊïÖ‰∏çÁ¥ç„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 54. This shows that Zhou Yu wanted to confine Liu Bei in Wu and use him as a hostage to control his men (Guan Yu, Zhang Fei and others), but nothing is mentioned about him using Lady Sun as a bait to lure Liu Bei into a trap. Instead, the women mentioned in the plan were used to entertain Liu Bei during his confinement and distract him from his men. Fa Zheng's biography in the Sanguozhi hints that Liu Bei and Lady Sun's relationship was not as romantic as described in Sanguo Yanyi, but rather, Liu Bei was suspicious of Lady Sun and feared her. Zhuge Liang once said, \\"When our lord (Liu Bei) was in Gong'an, he was wary of Cao Cao's influence in the north and fearful of Sun Quan's presence in the east. Even in home territory he was afraid that Lady Sun might stir up trouble.\\"(‰∫ÆÁ≠îÊõ∞Ôºö„Äå‰∏ªÂÖ¨‰πãÂú®ÂÖ¨ÂÆâ‰πüÔºåÂåóÁïèÊõπÂÖ¨‰πãÂº∑ÔºåÊù±ÊÜöÂ≠´Ê¨ä‰πãÈÄºÔºåËøëÂâáÊáºÂ≠´Â§´‰∫∫ÁîüËÆäÊñºËÇòËÖã‰πã‰∏ãÔºõ...„Äç) Sanguozhi vol. 37. Lady Sun's personality was described as follows in Fa Zheng's biography: Sun Quan married his sister to Liu Bei. She was fierce and tough in character, much like her elder brother. She had about 100 female servants, each of them standing on guard and carrying a sword. Every time Liu Bei entered (her room), he felt a chill in his heart.(ÂàùÔºåÂ≠´Ê¨ä‰ª•Â¶πÂ¶ªÂÖà‰∏ªÔºåÂ¶πÊâçÊç∑ÂâõÁåõÔºåÊúâË´∏ÂÖÑ‰πãÈ¢®Ôºå‰æçÂ©¢ÁôæÈ§ò‰∫∫ÔºåÁöÜË¶™Âü∑ÂàÄ‰æçÁ´ãÔºåÂÖà‰∏ªÊØèÂÖ•ÔºåË°∑ÂøÉÂ∏∏ÂáúÂáúÔºõ...) Sanguozhi vol. 37. Zhou Yu's death Zhou Yu's death is mentioned in Chapter 57. In the previous chapter, Zhou Yu comes up with a plan to help Sun Quan seize Jing Province from Liu Bei. He pretends to help Liu Bei attack Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) and asks for passage through Jing Province. When Liu Bei agrees, Zhou Yu feels overjoyed because his true intention is to conquer Jing Province when his army passes through. However, Zhuge Liang sees through Zhou Yu's ruse and sets a trap. Zhou Yu falls into the trap and is surrounded by Liu Bei's forces. He is overwhelmed by fury and falls off his horse. Zhuge Liang later writes a letter to Zhou Yu, asking him to give up on attacking Yi Province and return to Wu instead because Cao Cao might take advantage of his absence to invade Wu. Zhou Yu then writes to Sun Quan and tells the other Wu generals to give their full support to their lord. He faints afterwards, regains consciousness and sighs, \\"If (Zhou) Yu were to be born, why must (Zhuge) Liang exist as well?\\" He dies after repeating that line several times. This is the third time Zhou Yu is infuriated by Zhuge Liang after sustaining an arrow wound at the Battle of Jiangling. The first time was when Liu Bei, acting on Zhuge Liang's advice, seized control of many territories in Jing Province when Zhou Yu and his men were busy fighting with Cao Cao's forces for control of the province. The second time was when Zhuge Liang foiled his \\"beauty scheme\\" (see #Liu Bei and Lady Sun's marriage.) Zhou Yu's condition worsens after each incident and he eventually dies after the third incident.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 56-57. ;Historicity Zhou Yu's biography in the Sanguozhi mentions that Zhou was preparing for a campaign to conquer Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) and Hanzhong when he died of illness at Baqiu (Â∑¥‰∏ò; present-day Yueyang, Hunan).(ÊòØÊôÇÂäâÁíãÁÇ∫ÁõäÂ∑ûÁâßÔºåÂ§ñÊúâÂºµÈ≠ØÂØá‰æµÔºåÁëú‰πÉË©£‰∫¨Ë¶ãÊ¨äÊõ∞Ôºö„Äå‰ªäÊõπÊìçÊñ∞ÊäòË°ÇÔºåÊñπÊÜÇÂú®ËÖπÂøÉÔºåÊú™ËÉΩËàáÂ∞áËªçÈÅìÂÖµÁõ∏‰∫ã‰πü„ÄÇ‰πûËàáÂ•ÆÂ®Å‰ø±ÈÄ≤ÂèñËúÄÔºåÂæóËúÄËÄåÂπ∂ÂºµÈ≠ØÔºåÂõ†ÁïôÂ•ÆÂ®ÅÂõ∫ÂÆàÂÖ∂Âú∞ÔºåÂ•ΩËàáÈ¶¨Ë∂ÖÁµêÊè¥„ÄÇÁëúÈÇÑËàáÂ∞áËªçÊìöË•ÑÈôΩ‰ª•ËπôÊìçÔºåÂåóÊñπÂèØÂúñ‰πü„ÄÇ„ÄçÊ¨äË®±‰πã„ÄÇÁëúÈÇÑÊ±üÈôµÔºåÁÇ∫Ë°åË£ùÔºåËÄåÈÅìÊñºÂ∑¥‰∏òÁóÖÂçíÔºåÊôÇÂπ¥‰∏âÂçÅÂÖ≠„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 54. Nothing is mentioned about Zhuge Liang causing Zhou Yu's death. New Book of Mengde In Chapter 60, Liu Zhang sends Zhang Song as an envoy to meet Cao Cao in Xuchang. Zhang Song ridicules Cao Cao in front of his registrar, Yang Xiu. Yang Xiu shows Zhang Song the New Book of Mengde (Â≠üÂæ∑Êñ∞Êõ∏), a military book written by Cao Cao and based on The Art of War. Zhang Song looks through the book and laughs and says, \\"Even young children in Shu can recite this book, how can it be a \\"new book\\"?

(Cao Cao) plagiarised the book, and people like you are deceived by him.\\"(Ê≠§Êõ∏ÂêæËúÄ‰∏≠‰∏âÂ∞∫Â∞èÁ´•Ôºå‰∫¶ËÉΩÊöóË™¶Ôºå‰ΩïÁÇ∫„ÄéÊñ∞Êõ∏„ÄèÔºüÊ≠§ÊòØÊà∞ÂúãÊôÇÁÑ°ÂêçÊ∞èÊâÄ‰ΩúÔºåÊõπ‰∏ûÁõ∏ÁõúÁ´ä‰ª•ÁÇ∫Â∑±ËÉΩÔºåÊ≠¢Â•ΩÁûûË∂≥‰∏ãËÄ≥ÔºÅ) Sanguo Yanyi ch. 60. Zhang Song then recites the book verbatim to Yang Xiu. When Yang Xiu tells Cao Cao about the incident later, Cao Cao tears the book and burns it. The book was later found in a basin of ginger presented to Cao Cao by the sage Zuo Ci. ;Historicity The Wei Shu (È≠èÊõ∏) mentions that Cao Cao wrote military books and gave them to his generals.(È≠èÊõ∏Êõ∞ÔºöÂ§™Á•ñËá™Áµ±Á¶¶Êµ∑ÂÖßÔºåËäüÂ§∑Áæ§ÈÜúÔºåÂÖ∂Ë°åËªçÁî®Â∏´ÔºåÂ§ßËºÉ‰æùÂ≠´„ÄÅÂê≥‰πãÊ≥ïÔºåËÄåÂõ†‰∫ãË®≠Â•áÔºåË≠éÊïµÂà∂ÂãùÔºåËÆäÂåñÂ¶ÇÁ•û„ÄÇËá™‰ΩúÂÖµÊõ∏ÂçÅËê¨È§òË®ÄÔºåË´∏Â∞áÂæÅ‰ºêÔºåÁöÜ‰ª•Êñ∞Êõ∏Âæû‰∫ã„ÄÇ) Wei Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 1. The New Book of Mengde is mentioned and quoted in Questions and Replies between Tang Taizong and Li Weigong, a dialogue between Emperor Taizong of the Tang dynasty and the general Li Jing.Questions and Replies between Tang Taizong and Li Weigong on Chinese Wikisource. Cao Cao's commentary on The Art of War is still extant and is included in many annotated versions of the book. Battle of Tong Pass Pang Tong's death Battle of Jiameng Pass In 212, Liu Zhang invited Liu Bei into Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) to help him defend against Zhang Lu's forces in Hanzhong. Liu Bei proceeded to Jiameng Pass (in present-day Zhaohua District, Guangyuan, Sichuan) and stationed there. However, Liu Bei and Liu Zhang eventually turned hostile towards each other when Liu Zhang discovered that his follower Zhang Song had been plotting with Liu Bei to seize Yi Province from him. Liu Zhang formed an alliance with Zhang Lu against Liu Bei. Zhang Lu sent Ma Chao to lead an army to attack Liu Bei at Jiameng Pass. There, Ma Chao encountered Zhang Fei and duelled with him. After engaging each other in two long separate fights, neither Zhang Fei nor Ma Chao was able to gain an advantage over his opponent, and they retreated back to their respective camps. Liu Bei did not want either his sworn brother or Ma Chao to get hurt, so he consulted Zhuge Liang. Zhuge Liang suggested that Ma Chao would be of great help to them if he was willing to serve Liu Bei. Hence, Liu Bei sent Li Hui to persuade Ma Chao to switch allegiance to him. Concurrently, Liu Bei also sent people to spread negative rumours about Ma Chao in Hanzhong, causing Zhang Lu to become suspicious of Ma Chao. Ma Chao heard that Zhang Lu was starting to doubt his loyalty and planned to defect to Liu Bei, especially since Liu Bei was a rival of his sworn enemy, Cao Cao. At that time, Liu Bei was besieging Liu Zhang in Yi Province's capital Chengdu, when he received Ma Chao's request to serve him. Liu Bei was pleased and eagerly accepted Ma Chao's assistance, and sent troops and supplies to Ma Chao's camp. Following that, Ma Chao led his army to attack Chengdu from the north. Liu Zhang was shocked because he did not expect Ma Chao to make such a move. Shortly later, Liu Bei's adviser Jian Yong managed to convince Liu Zhang to surrender, and Yi Province came under Liu Bei's control. Ma Chao became one of the Five Tiger Generals under Liu Bei after the latter defeated Cao Cao in the Hanzhong Campaign and declared himself \\"King of Hanzhong\\". ;Historicity The Battle of Jiameng Pass was not documented in the historical text Records of the Three Kingdoms by Chen Shou. There is no mention of a duel between Ma Chao and Zhang Fei. Ma Chao's defection from Zhang Lu to Liu Bei's side is described in Ma Chao's biography as follows: An annotation from the Dianlue in Ma Chao's biography stated: Nothing is mentioned about the roles Zhuge Liang, Yang Song and Li Hui played in Ma Chao's defection. Guan Yu attends a meeting alone armed with only a blade Hua Tuo heals Guan Yu's arm Huo Tuo treats Guan Yu's poisoned arm by scraping the bone (ÂàÆÈ™®ÁôÇÊØí), portrait at the Long Corridor of the Summer Palace, Beijing During the Battle of Fancheng, Guan Yu is injured in the arm by a crossbow bolt coated with poison. The physician Hua Tuo comes to his camp and offers to heal his arm. After diagnosis, Hua Tuo says the poison has already seeped through the flesh into the bone and he needs to perform surgery on Guan Yu's arm. He also tells Guan Yu that he must be blindfolded and his arm must be secured before the surgery can be carried out, but Guan Yu says it is too troublesome and asks him to perform the surgery on the spot. Hua Tuo cuts open the flesh on Guan Yu's arm, exposing the bone, then scrapes off the venom on the bone and stitches up the wound. Guan Yu shows no sign of pain and continues playing weiqi with Ma Liang during the surgery. He thanks Hua Tuo for healing his arm and wants to reward him but the physician declines.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 74-75. ;Historicity Hua Tuo's biography in the Sanguozhi does not specify his year of death, but it is certain that he died before 208. (See #Cao Cao's death for more information.) The Battle of Fancheng took place in 219, some 11 years after 208, so it was not possible for Hua Tuo to be around to heal Guan Yu's arm. However, Guan Yu's biography in the Sanguozhi mentions a similar incident, but without Hua Tuo's involvement. See Guan Yu#Arm injury for details. L√º Meng's death Events after Guan Yu's death In Chapter 77, after Guan Yu died, his spirit roams the land and cries out, \\"Return my head!\\" His spirit comes to Yuquan Hill outside Dangyang and encounters Pujing, the monk who saved his life many years ago at Sishui Pass. Pujing tells Guan Yu's spirit, \\"Now you ask for your head, but from whom should Yan Liang, Wen Chou, the pass guardians and many others ask for theirs?\\" Guan Yu's spirit is enlightened and disappears, but henceforth it manifested itself around the hill and protected the locals from evil. The locals built a temple on the hill to worship the spirit. Pujing is said to have built a grass hut for himself at the southeastern foot of Yuquan Hill in the final years of the Eastern Han dynasty. The Yuquan Temple, the oldest temple in the Dangyang region from where the worship of Guan Yu originated, was built on the exact location of the hut, and its construction was completed only until the Sui dynasty. Sun Quan sends Guan Yu's head to Cao Cao in the hope of pushing the responsibility of Guan Yu's death to Cao Cao. When Cao Cao opens the box containing Guan Yu's head, he sees that Guan Yu's facial expressions resemble those of a living person. He smiles and says to the head, \\"I hope you are well since we last parted.\\" To his horror, Guan Yu's head opens its eyes and mouth and the long beard and hairs stand on ends. Cao Cao collapses and does not regain consciousness until a long time later. When he comes to, he exclaims, \\"General Guan is truly a god from heaven!\\" Then he orders the head to be buried with honours befitting a noble.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 77. Cao Cao's death When Cao Cao starts complaining about splitting headaches in his final days, his subjects recommend Hua Tuo, a physician with remarkable skills, to heal him. Hua Tuo diagnoses Cao Cao's illness to be a form of rheumatism in the skull. He suggests giving Cao Cao a dose of hashish and then splitting open his skull with a sharp axe to extract the pus within. Due to an earlier incident with another physician Ji Ping, who attempted to poison him, Cao Cao is suspicious of any physician. He believes that Hua Tuo intends to kill him to avenge Guan Yu so he orders the physician to be imprisoned. Hua Tuo dies a few days later in prison. Cao Cao dies from his illness not long later.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 77-78. ;Historicity Cao Cao's biography in the Sanguozhi mentions that he died in Luoyang in 220 at the age of 66 (by East Asian age reckoning).(Â∫öÂ≠êÔºåÁéãÂ¥©ÊñºÊ¥õÈôΩÔºåÂπ¥ÂÖ≠ÂçÅÂÖ≠„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 1. Hua Tuo's biography mentions that Cao Cao had Hua Tuo executed when Hua Tuo refused to treat his chronic headaches. Cao Cao regretted killing Hua Tuo because his son Cao Chong died from illness, and he believed that Hua Tuo could have cured Cao Chong. Hua Tuo's biography does not specify his year of death, but it is certain that he died before 208, the year in which Cao Chong died.(‰Ωó‰πãÁµïÊäÄÔºåÂá°Ê≠§È°û‰πü„ÄÇ ...

Battle of Xiaoting Zhang Liao's death Meng Huo captured and released seven times  The Nanman barbarian king Meng Huo rebels against Shu. Zhuge Liang leads an army to pacify the Nanman tribes. Meng Huo is defeated and captured by Zhuge Liang's forces seven times. During the first six times, Meng Huo complains that he is dissatisfied because he was captured by strategy and did not have a chance to fight a real battle, so Zhuge Liang releases him each time to come back for another battle. On the seventh time, Meng Huo feels ashamed of himself and swears eternal allegiance to Shu.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 87-91. ;Historicity Pei Songzhi's annotations to Zhuge Liang's biography in the Sanguozhi contain a line about \\"capture and release seven times\\"(‰∫ÆÁ¨ëÔºåÁ∏±‰ΩøÊõ¥Êà∞Ôºå‰∏ÉÁ∏±‰∏ÉÁ¶ΩÔºåËÄå‰∫ÆÁå∂ÈÅ£Áç≤„ÄÇ) Pei Songzhi's annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 35. but no details are provided.

He was cabinet minister for Civil Aviation and Tourism in 1996, Union Minister of State for Finance from 1999 to 2000 and Union Minister of State for Textiles from 2000 to 2003. He was also one of the first few BJP MPs to be elected from south India, at a time when the Congress party's reach was at its peak. Kumar went on to represent the Mangalore constituency in the Lok Sabha for four successive terms. Earlier in 1983, he was elected as a BJP MLA from Mangalore assembly constituency comfortably defeating sitting MLA from Congress, P. F. Rodrigues, even before he became an MP. Being a staunch loyalist of former Chief Minister of Karnataka B. S. Yeddyurappa, he was elected as the president of the new Karnataka Janata Party. He was the Special representative of the Government of Karnataka to the Union Government in New Delhi. Biography Born in Venur, a small town of erstwhile South Canara in 1951, Kumar earned degrees in science from Sri Mahaveera College, Moodabidri and law from Udupi Law College and held a number of influential positions in a political career that spanned decades. A firm believer of the RSS' Hindutva ideology, Kumar began his political career in the youth wing of Bharatiya Janta Party and later went on to become a Member of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly in 1983. In 1991, he was elected to the 10th Lok Sabha defeating the Congress stalwart Janardhana Poojary, Union Minister of State for Finance during the tenure of Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi. With the rise of the Bharatiya Janta Party in Karnataka, Kumar went on to represent the Mangalore (Lok Sabha constituency) for four successive terms and served as Union Minister, thrice in the Government of India when the Bharatiya Janata Party was in power. He was cabinet minister for Civil Aviation and Tourism in 1996, Union Minister of State for Finance from 1999 to 2000 and Union Minister of State for Textiles from 2000 to 2003. Despite of being a sitting MP, he was denied ticket for 2004 Loksabha election from Mangalore, instead D. V. Sadananda Gowda was preferred. During Yeddyurappa's tenure as chief minister between 2008 and 2011, Dhananjay became one of his closest confidantes. He was known for being staunchly loyal to BJP state president BS Yeddyurappa and was in the news in October 2012 for allegedly making abusive remarks against the central leadership for ousting Yeddyurappa from the Chief Minister's post. BJP, angered by Kumar's criticisms against leaders such L. K. Advani, expelled him. After leaving the saffron party with B. S. Yeddyurappa, a former chief minister of Karnataka, Kumar was instrumental in starting a new political outfit, Karnataka Janata Party. Dhananjay was even made the state president of the short-lived party. Soon Yeddyurappa rejoined the BJP and is now its leader in Karnataka. But, BJP never allowed Kumar, who spit venom against top leaders of party like Advani to rejoin the party. He later joined the Janata Dal (Secular) to contest 2014 Loksabha election from Udupi and lost very badly. He joined the Congress party, the party whom he fought against and defeated earlier. He was unable to actively participate due to ill heath.

Despite critics claiming that the lyrical finesse and aesthetic of the poem did not do justice to the cruelty of the Holocaust, others regard the poem as one that \\"combines mysteriously compelling imagery with rhythmic variations and structural patterns that are both elusive and pronounced\\".Weimar (1974), p. 86 At the same time it has been regarded as a \\"masterful description of horror and death in a concentration camp\\".Glenn (1972), p. 25. Celan was born to a Jewish family in Cernauti, Romania (now Chernivtsy, Ukraine); his parents died in a camp during the Second World War, and Celan himself was a prisoner for a time in a work camp. The poem has reached international relevance by being considered to be one of the most important poems of the post-war period and the most relevant example of Tr√ºmmerliteratur.  Summary  The poem is 36 lines long, with breaks after lines 9, 15, 18, 23 and 26, which would seem to divide it into six stanzas. However critics typically regard it as being in four sections, each of which begins with the image which can be translated as \\"Black milk of dawn.\\"Weimar (1974), p. 91. The speaking voice in the poem is mostly a collective \\"We\\". The structure of the poem has been said to reflect that of a musical fugueOlschner (1989) in that phrases are repeated and recombined, comparably to the musical genre. First section (lines 1‚Äì9) The \\"we\\" of the poem describes drinking the black milk of dawn at evening, noon, daybreak and night, and shovelling \\"a grave in the skies\\". They introduce a \\"he\\", who writes letters to Germany, plays with vipers, whistles orders to his dogs and to his Jews to dig a grave in the earth (the words \\"R√ºden\\" (male dogs) and \\"Juden\\" (Jews) are assonant in German),Weimar (1974), p. 88. and commands \\"us\\" to play music and dance. \\"He\\" uses the phrase \\"your golden hair Margarete\\", (hair, like the \\"black milk\\" becomes a recurrent theme of the poem); this may possibly in the letter that he writes to Germany, although the wording leaves this unclear. Second section (lines 10‚Äì19) The poem repeats many of the images of the first section, but with some changes of word-order. The golden hair of Margarete is now counterpointed with \\"your ashen hair Shulamith\\", and \\"he\\" now grabs his gun, and is described as blue-eyed, while issuing his orders. Third section (lines 20‚Äì26) Again the images are counterpointed and extended. \\"He\\" is now associated with the phrase \\"Death is a master from Germany\\", and in his orders to play music threatens \\"you'll rise to the sky like smoke, you'll have a grave in the clouds\\". Fourth section (lines 27‚Äì36) In a further reworking of the themes and images of the poem so far, it emerges that \\"Death is a master from Germany, his eyes are blue\\", and the \\"he\\" shoots his victims with leaden bullets, and sets his dogs on the victims, leading to their \\"grave in the sky.\\" The final two lines of the poem counterpose \\"your golden hair, Margarete/your ashen hair Shulamith.\\" Origins, composition and publication  \\"It was clear to every reader from the start that [] was concerned with camps and the (The Final Solution to the Jewish Question), made doubly poignant by the circumstance that the author was known to be a Jew from Eastern Europe.\\"Forster (1985), p. 1 However although it has often been assumed to reflect the author's own experiences, Celan himself was never a prisoner in a death camp; the poem reflects more directly the experiences recounted to him. The exact date of composition of the poem is not known; a date of 1944 or 1945 seems to be most likely. Rose Ausl√§nder (photo from 1939) The poem contains direct references, or apparent references, to other contemporary works. The oxymoronic image of \\"black milk\\" appeared in a poem published in 1939 by Rose Ausl√§nder. Ausl√§nder herself is recorded as saying that this usage by Celan was \\"self-explanatory, as the poet may take all material to transmute in his own poetry. It's an honour to me that a great poet found a stimulus in my own modest work\\".Cited in Forster (1985), p. 10 The relationship of \\"\\" to the poem \\"\\" (HIM) by the poet is more problematic. Written in the early 1940s (the exact date is unknown), \\"\\" includes lines about \\"Gretchen's golden hair\\", \\"digging graves in the air\\", \\"playing with snakes\\", and \\"Death, the German Master\\", all of which occur in \\"\\".\\"\\" on celan- projekt website, accessed 2 July 2014; Forster (1985), p. 1, pp. 6‚Äì7 Weissglas (1920‚Äì1979) was like Celan, a native of Cernauti/Czernowitz in the Bukovina, and the two were at school together, and knew each other in the immediate post-war period in Bucharest, when they were also both acquainted with Rose Ausl√§nder. It was probably Weissglas, who had been interned in Transnistria with Celan's parents, who told Celan of his parents' deaths and their circumstances.Forster (1985), p. 1, p. 3 \\"\\" was written in the early 1940s (the exact date is unknown), and was never published. It was part of a typescript collection by Weissglas, ' (God's Mills in Berlin), which however Celan would almost certainly have read.Forster (1985), pp. 3‚Äì4 However, the tone and form of \\"\\" and \\"\\" are completely different. Jean Bollack wrote of \\"\\" that Celan \\"rearranges [the] elements [of \\"\\"] without adding any new ones; the elements are the same, but he manages to create something completely different using them\\".Bollack (2006), p. 47 \\"\\" was first published in a Romanian translation titled \\"\\" (\\"Tango of Death\\") in 1947; Celan's close friend Petre Solomon was the translator.Fesltiner (2001), p. 27 This version was also the first poem to be published under the pseudonym \\"Celan\\", derived from the syllables of \\"Antschel\\", Celan's real name.Bekker (2008), p. xii The original German version appeared in the 1948 Der Sand aus den Urnen, Celan's first collection of poems; but this edition was small, and was withdrawn because of its many misprints. The poem first became well-known when it was included in Celan's 1952 collection, Mohn und Ged√§chtnis. It has since appeared in numerous anthologies and translations. Themes and interpretation Mauthausen Concentration camp, 30 June 1942: an orchestra of inmates Although the work is titled a fugue, there is no literal manner of reproducing the musical form of fugue in words; the title must therefore be taken as a metaphor, the phrases and rhythms of the work parallelling the introduction and repetition of musical themes.Olschner (1989), p. 79 Rhythm is a strong element of the work, which in its Romanian and German typescript versions was called Death Tango;Olschner (1989), pp. 79‚Äì80 the poem is structured to give a strong impression of dactyl and trochee rhythms.Weimar (1974), p. 93 These are brought out in the poet's own reading of the work, which also varies speed, becoming faster at moments of tension and slowing dramatically for the final lines. While the events which emerge for the poem strongly evoke aspects of life (and death) in the concentration camps, other references are more indirect. \\"Margarete\\" may evoke the heroine of Goethe's Faust, whilst \\"Shulamith\\" (the female version of the Hebrew name Solomon), is a figure who appears in the Song of Songs, where she describes herself as \\"black, yet comely\\" (Ch. 1 v. 5). The two figures may thus stand as metaphors for Germans and Jews.Weimar (1974), p. 93 There is extensive evidence of Nazi concentration camp orchestras being created from amongst the prisoners and forced to provide entertainment for their SS gaolers.See \\"The Concentration and Death Camps\\", Music and the Holocaust, accessed 6 July 2014. However, the victims in \\"\\" being forced to make music and dance for \\"Him\\" also recall the exiled Jews in Babylon being asked by their captors to sing (Psalm 137 v. 3; \\"For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion\\"). Moreover, in the specific context of German poetry, they recall the slaves in Heinrich Heine's poem \\"The Slave Ship\\" being forced to dance by the mercenary captain.Forster (1985), p. 11, pp. 17‚Äì18; for a translation of the Heine poem see here (accessed 5 July 2014). The recurrent themes, encoded content and dialogic constructions demonstrate Celan's tendencies towards hermeticism. Influence Bonnie Roos asserts that the poem \\"has become a national symbol in postwar Germany.\\"Roos (2006), p. 29. Nan Rosenthal has noted \\"It was anthologised in readers for [German] high-schools...It was also set to music by numerous German composers and read on television programmes...To commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of Kristallnacht in 1988, \\"Death Fugue\\" was read aloud in the Bundestag\\" (the German Parliament).Rosenthal (1999), p. 88. \\"\\" has been set as a musical work by, among others, the American composers Samuel AdlerWorldCat entry, accessed 6 July 2014 and Aaron Jay Kernis, the Hungarian composer Gy√∂rgy K√≥sa and the Israeli composer Leon Shidlovsky.\\"Death Fugue\\", site of Milken Archive of Jewish music, accessed 5 July 2014. Harrison Birtwistle has set the poem as part of his cycle Pulse Shadows: Meditations on Paul Celan; the setting also contains hints of the poem's original tango associations.Whitall 92003), pp. 159‚Äì165. The German composer Hans-J√ºrgen von Bose has written a version for mixed choir, organ and baritone solo.Details, Schott Music, accessed 6 July 2014. Diamanda Gal√°s composed and sang a piano version of the poem in her 2003 live album Defixiones: Will and Testament. The phrase (\\"Death is a master from Germany)\\" has been used in songs, often in altered form, e.g. by the Black Metal-Band Eisregen (their 2005 album ' contains \\"Der Tod ist ein Meister aus Th√ºringen\\"). The poem is used in a song by German punk band Slime, \\"Der Tod ist ein Meister aus Deutschland\\"., Slime R√ºdiger Safranski titled his biography of Martin Heidegger, who was involved with the Nazi party, .Safranski (1994) The poem's concluding couplet‚Äîin translation, \\"your golden hair Margarete / your ashen hair Sulamith\\"‚Äîwas used as the title of two paintings, ' and ', created in 1981 by the German artist Anselm Kiefer.Roos (2006), pp. 27‚Äì8.

International treaties, such as the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, attempt to maximize the peaceful uses of space and restrict the militarization of space. Space policy intersects with science policy, since national space programs often perform or fund research in space science, and also with defense policy, for applications such as spy satellites and anti- satellite weapons. It also encompasses government regulation of third-party activities such as commercial communications satellites and private spaceflight. Space policy also encompasses the creation and application of space law, and space advocacy organizations exist to support the cause of space exploration. Space law Space law is an area of the law that encompasses national and international law governing activities in outer space. There are currently five treaties that make up the body of international space law. The inception of the field of space law began with the launch of the world's first artificial satellite by the Soviet Union in October 1957. Named Sputnik 1, the satellite was launched as part of the International Geophysical Year. Since that time, space law has evolved and assumed more importance as mankind has increasingly come to use and rely on space-based resources.  Policy by country  Soviet Union  The Soviet Union became the world's first spacefaring state by launching its first satellite, Sputnik 1, on 4 October 1957.  United States  United States space policy is drafted by the Executive branch at the direction of the President of the United States, and submitted for approval and establishment of funding to the legislative process of the United States Congress.Goldman, pp.79‚Äì83. The President may also negotiate with other nations and sign space treaties on behalf of the US, according to his or her constitutional authority. Congress' final space policy product is, in the case of domestic policy a bill explicitly stating the policy objectives and the budget appropriation for their implementation to be submitted to the President for signature into law, or else a ratified treaty with other nations. Space advocacy organizations (such as the Space Science Institute, National Space Society, and the Space Generation Advisory Council, learned societies such as the American Astronomical Society and the American Astronautical Society; and policy organizations such as the National Academies) may provide advice to the government and lobby for space goals. Civilian and scientific space policy is carried out by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, subsequent to 29 July 1958), and military space activities (communications, reconnaissance, intelligence, mapping, and missile defense) are carried out by various agencies of the Department of Defense. The President is legally responsible for deciding which space activities fall under the civilian and military areas.National Aeronautics and Space Act (1958), Sec. 102(b). In addition, the Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration operates various services with space components, such as the Landsat program.Goldman, pp. 91‚Äì97. The President consults with NASA and Department of Defense on their space activity plans, as potential input for the policy draft submitted to Congress. He or she also consults with the National Security Council, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the Office of Management and Budget to take into account Congress's expected willingness to provide necessary funding levels for proposed programs. Once the President's policy draft or treaty is submitted to the Congress, civilian policies are reviewed by the House Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics and the Senate Subcommittee on Science and Space. These committees also exercise oversight over NASA's operations and investigation of accidents such as the 1967 Apollo 1 fire. Military policies are reviewed and overseen by the House Subcommittee on Strategic Forces and the Senate Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, as well as the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee conducts hearings on proposed space treaties, and the various appropriations committees have power over the budgets for space-related agencies. Space policy efforts are supported by Congressional agencies such as the Congressional Research Service, the Congressional Budget Office, and Government Accountability Office.Goldman, pp. 107‚Äì112. =History= landing a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s decade, in response to contemporary Soviet space successes. This speech at Rice University on 12 September 1962 is famous for the quote \\"We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.\\" The early history of United States space policy is linked to the US‚ÄìSoviet Space Race of the 1960s. The National Aeronautics and Space Act creating NASA was passed in 1958, after the launch of the Soviet Sputnik 1 satellite. Thereafter, in response to the flight of Yuri Gagarin as the first man in space, Kennedy in 1961 committed the United States to landing a man on the Moon by the end of the decade. Although the costs of the Vietnam War and the programs of the Great Society forced cuts to NASA's budget as early as 1965, the first Moon landing occurred in 1969, early in Richard Nixon's presidency. Under the Nixon administration NASA's budget continued to decline and three of the planned Apollo Moon landings were cancelled. The Nixon administration approved the beginning of the Space Shuttle program in 1972, but did not support funding of other projects such as a Mars landing, colonization of the Moon, or a permanent space station.Goldman, pp. 84‚Äì90. The Space Shuttle first launched in 1981, during Ronald Reagan's administration. Reagan in 1982 announced a renewed active space effort, which included initiatives such the construction of Space Station Freedom, and the military Strategic Defense Initiative, and, later in his term, a 30 percent increase in NASA's budget. The Space Shuttle Challenger disaster in January 1986 led to a reevaluation of the future of the national space program in the National Commission on Space report and the Ride Report. The United States has participated in the International Space Station beginning in the 1990s, the Space Shuttle program has continued, although the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster has led to the planned retirement of the Space Shuttle in mid-2011. There is a current debate on the post-Space Shuttle future of the civilian space program: the Constellation program of the George W. Bush administration directed NASA to create a set of new spacecraft with the goal of sending astronauts to the Moon and Mars, but the Obama administration cancelled the Constellation program, opting instead to emphasize development of commercial rocket systems. The Vision for Space Exploration established under the George W. Bush administration in 2004 was replaced with a new policy released by Barack Obama on 28 June 2010. In recent years, U.S. space operators and decisionmakers have become increasingly concerned about threats to U.S. space leadership. In the civil sector, this has been driven largely by U.S. dependence on Russia for crew access to the International Space Station (ISS) since the termination of the space shuttle program in 2011. In national security, foreign development of counterspace systems has become a regular feature of public statements by U.S. defense and intelligence officials.Cecil D. Haney, ‚ÄúStatement before the Senate Committee on Armed Services,‚Äù February 27, 2014 This is reminiscent of similar concerns about the Soviet Union‚Äôs space program between the launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957 and the success of the Apollo lunar missions. The threat of Soviet dominance in space turned out to be less formidable than expected, but it continued to drive policy and programmatic decisions for decades, until the Soviet Union ceased to exist.Vedda, James. Space Leadership in Transition, November 2019  Europe  The ESA is an international organization whose membership overlaps with, but is not the same as, that of the EU. The European Space Agency (ESA) is the common space agency for many European nations. It is independent of the European Union, though the 2007 European Space Policy provides a framework for coordination between the two organizations and member states, including issues such as security and defence, access to space, space science, and space exploration. The ESA was founded to serve as a counterweight to the dominant United States and Soviet space programs, and further the economic and military independence of Europe. This has included the development of the Ariane rockets, which by 1985 had captured over 40 percent of commercial launch market in the free world. The ESA budget is split between mandatory and voluntary programs, the latter of which allow individual member nations to pursue their own national space goals within the organization.Goldman, pp. 34‚Äì36. The ESA Director General's Proposal for the European Space Policy states, \\"Space systems are strategic assets demonstrating independence and the readiness to assume global responsibilities. Initially developed as defence or scientific projects, they now also provide commercial infrastructures on which important sectors of the economy depend and which are relevant in the daily life of citizens.... Europe needs an effective space policy to enable it to exert global leadership in selected policy areas in accordance with European interests and values.\\" In the final part of 2010s the ESA has made strong efforts in order to make Europe stronger in the competition for the development of new strategies regarding space policy. Those included a huge increase in ESA's budget promoted by countries such as Italy, France and Germany.Andrea Muratore, Icaro nel XXI secolo, Osservatorio Globalizzazione, 29 February 2020  China  Although Chairman Mao Zedong planned after Russia's Sputnik 1 launch to place a Chinese satellite in orbit by 1959 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC), China did not successfully launch its first satellite until 24 April 1970. Mao and Zhou Enlai decided on 14 July 1967 that the PRC should not be left behind, and started China's own human spaceflight program. The first success came on 15 October 2003 when China sent its first astronaut into space for 21 hours aboard Shenzhou 5. The Ministry of Aerospace Industry was responsible for the Chinese space program prior to July 1999, when it was split into the China National Space Administration responsible for setting policy, and the state-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, responsible for implementation. The China National Space Administration states its aims as maintaining the country's overall development strategy, making innovations in an independent and self-reliant manner, promoting the country's science and technology sector and encouraging economic and social development, and actively engaging in international cooperation.  Russian Federation and Ukraine  The Russian Federation inherited their space programs in 1991 from its predecessor state, the Soviet Union. Russia's civilian space agency is the Russian Federal Space Agency, and its military counterpart is the Russian Aerospace Defence Forces. Ukraine's agency is the State Space Agency of Ukraine, which handles both civilian and military programs. In the 1980s the Soviet Union was considered to be technologically behind the United States, but it outspent the United States in its space budget, and its cosmonauts had spent three times as many days in space as American astronauts. The Soviet Union had also been more willing than the United States to embark on long-term programs, such as the Salyut and Mir space station programs, and increased their investment in space programs throughout the 1970s and 1980s.Goldman, pp. 38‚Äì42. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the 1990s saw serious financial problems because of the decreased cash flow, which encouraged Roskosmos to improvise and seek other ways to keep space programs running. This resulted in Roskosmos' leading role in commercial satellite launches and space tourism. While scientific missions, such as interplanetary probes or astronomy missions during these years played a very small role, although roskosmos has connections with Russian aerospace forces, its budget is not part of the defense budget of the country, Roskosmos managed to operate the space station Mir well past its planned lifespan, contribute to the International Space Station, and continue to fly additional Soyuz and Progress missions. The Russian economy boomed throughout 2005 from high prices for exports, such as oil and gas, the outlook for subsequent funding became more favorable. The federal space budget for the year 2009 was left unchanged despite the global economic crisis, standing at about 82 billion rubles ($2.4 billion). Current priorities of the Russian space program include the new Angara rocket family and development of new communications, navigation and remote Earth sensing spacecraft. The GLONASS global navigation satellite system has for many years been one of the top priorities and has been given its own budget line in the federal space budget.  India  The purpose of India's space program was outlined by Vikram Sarabhai (regarded as the father of the Indian space program): The Department of Space (DoS) is the Indian government department responsible for administration of the Indian space program. It manages several agencies and institutes related to space exploration and space technologies. The Indian space program under the DoS aims to promote the development and application of space science and technology for the socio-economic benefit of the country. It includes two major satellite systems, INSAT for communication, television broadcasting and meteorological services, and Indian Remote Sensing Satellites (IRS) system for resources monitoring and management. It has also developed two satellite launch vehicles, Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV), to place IRS and INSAT class satellites in orbit.

It was closed at the end of the 2009 school year. History Construction of CCNZ began in 1952. In 1955, the LDS Church announced that it would construct a temple in Hamilton. LDS Church president David O. McKay initially went to New Zealand to downsize the building programme. After visiting the project, McKay was so impressed with what he saw and felt he decided to add two more buildings to the school's construction. These buildings were later named the David O. McKay Auditorium and the Matthew Cowley Administration Building.. Page 51. CCNZ and the New Zealand Temple were built on the same 35 hectare site, in what later became known as Temple View, a suburb of Hamilton. Both facilities were built entirely by LDS Church volunteer labour missionaries. CCNZ was dedicated and formally opened on 26 April 1958 by McKay. Clifton D. Boyack was the school's first principal. Construction Foundations were laid for CCNZ in the early 1950s. The first visit to a property in the area occurred in 1950. The mission president, Gordon C.Young, drove out to the area, and when first seeing the site as he drove over a nearby hill where he pictured in his mind white buildings on the property and immediately felt this was the place the LDS Church was to build a school. He arranged to acquire the property the same day. He specifically stated many times that he did not ever see the temple on the property in vision because he had only been given the assignment to find property and also that only the LDS Church president could propose sites for a new temple. Church representatives from Utah came and inspected the property, and members of the church from all over New Zealand slowly moved into the area to work as labor missionaries on the project. Before work commenced on the school, the surrounding property began to be developed, including accommodations for the people who came to work were built, and a social infrastructure was established. Initially, there were only a few people at the site. Much of the surrounding land was peat, and it took some ingenuity to make the land agriculturally productive. The temple foundations were put in place after McKay selected the site at a later date Many of the existing buildings were used as temporary quarters for those participating in construction and administration. Cottages were built to house the building missionaries when they arrived. Dormitory-type accommodations were provided for the single men. Food was sent in from the church members in other parts of the country, and some of it was grown locally. A stream ran across the property behind the men's accommodation and behind their eating house. In the winters it always flooded so the men's accommodation and some of the cottages were usually semi-submerged in water at the time. A young child drowned in the stream so for safety concrete piping was brought in for protection, and to seal the stream. The concrete bricks for the school buildings were manufactured locally by a special crew of building missionaries. There were specialist plumbing, electrical, painting, welding, mechanic and other crews for the construction of the many facilities. Supervisors for these crews were called from the U.S. They came with their families, and helped greatly with the overall communal life of the building missionaries. The building missionaries were exposed to the way the LDS Church did things in the U.S., and this helped facilitate the transition of the LDS Church in New Zealand from its mission status to the stake and ward system. Notable alumni Enrollment The school taught students in New Zealand's educational years nine through thirteen (13- to 18-year-olds). While in operation there were approximately 700 students and 100 faculty/staff members, until its last year, when the student body was 120 students and 50 staff members. A modest tuition was charged but the school is heavily subsidized by the LDS Church. In 2009, approximately 10% of Latter Day Saint high school students in New Zealand attended Church College, with some attending the school away from home as a boarding school. Closure On 29 June 2006, LDS Church leaders announced that CCNZ would cease accepting new students in 2007 and would close at the end of the 2009 school year; in discussing its decision, a church policy to close its private secondary schools when the public school system is able to offer \\"quality education\\" was cited.\\"LDS church phases out New Zealand high school\\", Associated Press, 2006-07-18. Proposed plans After it was closed, LDS Church leaders had planned to demolish parts of the school site and convert it into farmland. These plans were challenged by some of the Temple View community and CCNZ alumni. Robert Cammock, president of the Temple View Heritage Society, proposed that the Temple View community should decide the future of the school. The LDS Church has now indicated that demolition of key buildings is no longer on the agenda and has formally withdrawn its application from the local city council. It has indicated that many more buildings may be saved and several options are now being investigated for future usage. Although some historic buildings were repurposed, much of the college was demolished in 2018 and it was planned to replace it with about 200 houses.

Life  Moses Clark White was born in Paris, Oneida County, New York on July 24, 1819. White matriculated at Wesleyan University in 1842 and graduated in 1845. After graduation from Wesleyan, he spent two years in Yale studying medicine and theology, and sometimes preached in the nearby town of Milford, Connecticut. On March 13, 1847, White married Jane Isabel Atwater of Homer, who came from Cortland County, New York and was then a teacher in the Sabbath School in Rochester, N.Y. left In September 1847 Moses White and Jane, along with Judson Dwight Collins, arrived in Foochow, beginning their missionary work there. Jane, however, fell sick shortly afterwards and finally died of consumption on May 25, 1848, at the age of 26. In 1851, White was married a second time to Mary Seely, who came from Onondaga, New York and also went to Foochow as a missionary. During his seven years in Foochow, Moses White conducted a school for the secular and religious instruction of the Foochow people, and after mastering the local Fuzhou dialect, he translated the Gospel of Matthew, which was the first Christian document ever published in that vernacular. At the same time, White also served as a doctor, studying and treating the toxic effects of opium. Due to his poor health, Moses White was forced to leave Foochow in 1853 for New Haven (his wife Mary also left one year earlier) where he resumed medical studies at Yale and began a medical practice which he continued until the end of his life. He received an M.D. degree from Yale in 1854. In July 1856, he published in Methodist Quarterly Review his summarizing treatise on Fuzhou dialect The Chinese Language Spoken at Fuh Chau.

The village can be reached by car from Visby. The island of F√•r√∂ can be reached by ferry from F√•r√∂sund. F√•r√∂sund is the northernmost town in the municipality of Gotland in Gotland County, about north of Visby. F√•r√∂sund is situated on the seafront overlooking the island of F√•r√∂ and is visited by tourists during the summer, but it is usually a quiet community in the autumn, winter and spring. Until the mid-1900s it was a small quiet resort as well as a ferry terminal for ferries to F√•r√∂. As of February 2017 the Swedish Government is attempting to buy back the former naval port and related facilities, in the face of opposition from private interests including a Russian oligarch, as part of the emergency remilitarization of Gotland in the second half of the 2010s. F√•r√∂sund is also the name of the strait between Gotland's \\"mainland\\" and F√•r√∂.  History  During the Crimean War, the fleet of the alliance opposing the Russian Empire used F√•r√∂sund as their Baltic Sea base. An artillery battery for the defence of the southern part of the inlet to F√•r√∂sund had been built in 1721, on the south shore opposite the Skarv shallows, and a blockhouse housing two 8 pounder cannons was constructed further out on the Bungen√§s. After the Treaty of Nystad in 1721, these fortifications were abandoned. In 1818, F√•r√∂sund's importance as a Naval base was once again brought to light. In 1885, when it seemed like there could be a conflict between Russia and the UK, the area around the town was further fortified by placing a line of naval mines around the harbor. This escalation of the defence was made to indicate that Sweden was determined to maintain its neutrality. Therefore, a battery housing of seven 12 cm muzzle-loading guns was hastily built at the south end of the strait. Later, a similar but smaller battery was built at the north end and finally a third, for heavier artillery, southeast of the first battery. In 1900‚Äì02, the two first batteries were converted and updated with more modern armament. Since 1905, there was a coastal artillery detachment from Vaxholm Coastal Artillery Regiment (KA 1) stationed in F√•r√∂sund where barracks for the unit had been built in 1902‚Äì06. The Gotland Coastal Artillery Regiment (KA 3), established in 1937, started an economic boom in the town including the building of a new shipyard. Prior to the 1950s, the port also served as a submarine base (it remained available as a forward operating location for submarines up until the 1990s). The regiment, however, was dissolved in 2000. , the old military regiment area is demilitarized and used by many companies that have started since the regiment was closed. In February 2017 though it was being reported (initially by the daily business newspaper Dagens Industri) that the government, in the form of the Swedish Fortifications Agency, was attempting to buy back the old military facilities including the port despite competing bids from private interests including the controversial Russian billionaire Vladimir Antonov who wished to procure them for their own purposes. This was part of ongoing efforts to rebuild Gotland's (and by extension, Sweden's) defences in light of the continuing deterioration in regional stability. In January 2018 the Swedish Armed Forces have reportedly bought back the base in a deal under negotiation since February 2017. The purchase faced competition from a Russian oligarch who showed interest in the port, but the sale went to the Swedish Fortifications Agency, which paid 20 million Swedish krona for it, after having sold it for 18 million in 2004. The sale requires government approval before 16 April 2018, and the Swedish Armed Forces are to take the base over on 30 April 2018.

He was mostly known, both professionally and socially, by his middle-name as Francis Hemming. Hemming was a British civil servant and amateur lepidopterist. An expert in biological nomenclature, he served from 1937 to 1958 as Secretary to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature and was founder and editor of the Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature. Over his lifetime he published more than 1,000 scientific papers on Lepidoptera. His manuscripts and other papers are deposited in the Natural History Museum in London and at the Bodleian Library, Oxford. Hemming was educated at Rugby School, and Corpus Christi College, Oxford. During World War I he was severely wounded in 1916, and in 1918 he joined the British Civil Service. He was private secretary to several ministers and was granted the C.M.G. and C.B.E. for his services, especially in the revision of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (often jokingly referred to as the Hemming Code) that was officially adopted in 1958. The genus Nabokovia (Lycaenidae) was named by Hemming in 1960, in honor of the novelist and entomologist Vladimir Nabokov, whose earlier generic name was found by Hemming to be a junior homonym. Nabokov invited Hemming to provide the substitute name. First married to Vera Montague Murray in 1924 (marriage dissolved in 1932) with whom he had one son, Christopher Francis Hemming. Second marriage to novelist Marjorie McLean Firminger (Jam To-Day, 1930) on 1 June 1933, third marriage in 1947 to Margaret Francis Waley Joseph (b. April 29, 1910), with whom he had two daughters, Rachel Cecilia Waley Hemming (b. 1947) and Judith Frances Waley Hemming (b. 1948).

Dating from the end of the 17th and beginning of the 18th century, it was profoundly transformed by the Duke of Castries between 1843 and 1863, under the architects Joseph-Antoine Froelicher and Fran√ßois Cl√©ment Joseph Parent. History H√¥tel de Nogent The h√¥tel was originally built around the end of the 17th century by Jean Dufour, seigneur de Nogent. Typical of residences of this time, it had a courtyard forming a perfect square and two wings projecting off a central body to form a U, all of the same height. Slate-roofed, each of the wings had a passage running through it, with that on the left (preserved today) leading to the kitchens and that on the right to the stables. In the right wing was to be found an antechamber, a grand staircase, a dining room, another room of the stables, and an attic. The left wing also contained a staircase with iron stair rods, three small rooms, another room, and another attic. The central body contained a double-height (i.e. filling the ground and first floors) great hall and four other rooms. Alterations by the marquis de Castries On 27 September 1708, Jean Dufour's widow, Ang√©lique Guyner, sold the h√¥tel to Jean Fran√ßois de La Croix de Castries (1663-1728), first marquis de Castries, who bought it with an inheritance from his uncle the cardinal of Bonzi (?-1703), archbishop of Narbonne. That inheritance also meant he could afford to spend 20,000 livres on rebuilding of the house and expansion of its gardens from 1708 to 1714. The Castries family held onto it until the end of the 19th century. On his death, the building was rented in 1729 to Charles Armand de Gontaut-Biron (1663-1756), for 7,500 livres a year. Embellishments by the marshal de Castries In 1743, the marquis's third son, Charles Eug√®ne Gabriel de La Croix de Castries (1727-1801), future marshal of France, recuperated at the family h√¥tel and installed himself there before his marriage to Gabrielle Isabeau Th√©r√®se de Rozet de Rocozel de Fleury, daughter of the first duc de Fleury. A 1761 inheritance from his uncle the Marshal of Belle-Isle left Charles to with a huge fortune, and allowed him to initiate grand works on the h√¥tel's interior decoration, led by the sculptor Jacques Verberckt. A new gate onto the street was built by Jacques-Antoine Payen in 1762, which may still be seen, and the two wings were linked by a high wall surmounted by a balustrade. In 1778, Adrien-Louis de Bonnieres, duc de Guines (1735-1806), rented part of this mansion, and he died here at the age of seventy-one. Additions by the second duke of Castries During the French Revolution, the h√¥tel was seized as one of the goods of an √©migr√© and assigned to the ministry of war. In 1842, on the death of his father, the second duke of Castries, Edmond Eug√®ne Philippe Hercule de La Croix de Castries (1787-1866) undertook important restoration and transformation work on the building, by then in a poor state, under the direction of Joseph-Antoine Froelicher between 1843 and 1863, then under the direction of his son-in-law, Fran√ßois Cl√©ment Joseph Parent, who directed the works until his death. It was these works that gave the building its present appearance. As early as 1851, the duke of Castries took tenants: the Clermont-Tonnerres et les La Rochefoucauld-Liancourts occupied the left wing; at the beginning of the Second French Empire, the Lestrades, the Saint-Aignans, the Laguiches and the comte de Beaumont all had apartments in the h√¥tel de Castries. After the Castries On the death of the second duke of Castries, the h√¥tel passed to his nephew Edmond Charles Auguste de La Croix de Castries. On his death in 1886, his widow remarried, to vicomte Emmanuel d‚ÄôHarcourt, who sold the h√¥tel de Castries to the Montgermonts. The h√¥tel was therefore lived in by prince Louis de Broglie, the comtesse de la Roche-Aymon, and the comte de Castellane, who rented the ground floor and garden in 1936. In 1946, the Domaines requisitioned the h√¥tel to house the Ministry of Agriculture. Several other ministries later occupied the building, including the Fonction Publique and its present occupiers the Ministry of Housing and Cities.

With his trademark shout \\"Bleah, bleah, BLEAAAHHH!\\" and his inimitable tongue-fluttering \\"Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl-bl-bl-bl-bl- bl...\\", The Cool Ghoul was an icon of Cincinnati television, radio and local pop culture for over four decades. When not donning the makeup and wig on the classic 1970s horror movie show Scream-In, Von Hoene doubled as a news anchor on WXIX, and later hosted other news, radio, and public affairs shows in Cincinnati and northern Kentucky, including Northern Kentucky Magazine, which he was hosting at the time of his death. Character The Cool Ghoul's origins date back to 1961, when Von Hoene worked on a WCPO (now WDBZ) radio show called \\"Bob Smith's Monster Mash\\". Around that time, The Cool Ghoul started appearing in comedy routines Von Hoene wrote for colleague and puppeteer Larry Smith. By 1969, Von Hoene had moved into television, working at the fledgling TV station WXIX in Cincinnati. It was at this time that Von Hoene developed a costume for the character. Initially, the character proved to be a little too scary for children, so Von Hoene altered the character to it more silly than scary. The Cool Ghoul's wig, a bright orange-reddish coiffure, became the trademark for the character. Many years later, Von Hoene was told that it was only the rear half of a wig that costumer Dana Bruce made for a customer who was subsequently killed in a car crash. After the woman's death, the wig had been cut in half - the front from the back - and the front part was reportedly placed on the woman's body in the coffin. Scream-In Early 70s Promo slide for Scream-In on WXIX-TV During the early 1970s, The Cool Ghoul hosted his own Saturday night horror movie show, Scream-In (the name was taken from Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In). The Cool Ghoul's campy but loveable sense of humor endeared him to fans both young and old. The Cool Ghoul had visitors on his show often, including Larry Smith's Hattie the Witch. Von Hoene could do an uncanny vocal impersonation of horror icon Boris Karloff, and so he was also the off-screen voice announcer for the show. Longtime WXIX announcer Greg Eversull claims Von Hoene's Karloff impression was so good, it even fooled a lady who was the real Karloff's private secretary for 30 years. In 1971, Von Hoene released The Cool Ghoul's Phantasmagorical Funky Fonograf Record, featuring a parody of the 1920s standard \\"Has Anybody Seen My Gal?\\" called \\"Ten Foot Two, Eyes Of Glue (Has Anybody Seen My Ghoul)\\". Scream-In ran only three and a half years, but the Cool Ghoul had become so popular that he continued to make numerous public appearances for years, including occasional commercials and annual TV appearances almost every Halloween. As The Cool Ghoul, Von Hoene also took part in various fundraisers in and around Cincinnati with local sports teams. The Cincinnati Reds gave The Cool Ghoul a jersey with the \\"number zero\\". In the early 1980s, Von Hoene took The Cool Ghoul to WCTI-TV in New Bern, North Carolina, earning a new generation of fans in the process. Personal life Von Hoene was a Cincinnati native, raised in Madisonville and lived most of his life in Price Hill, both Cincinnati neighborhoods. He earned a B.A. in history and a M.A. in theater from the University of Cincinnati. His real name and stage name were spelled exactly the same, but pronounced differently; at home it was \\"Haney\\", on the air it was \\"Hane.\\" Dick Von Hoene died of a heart attack at age 63 on February 4, 2004.

Plans for the plane, which was named in honour of Western Australia's 1929 centenary, were drawn to scale on the floor of the Beverley powerhouse which Ford owned. The aircraft made its inaugural flight on 1 July 1930 and was flown for the next 18 months, but after Ford proved unable to provide the authorities with blue prints and technical specifications, it was mothballed in 1933.  Overview  For the next thirty years, the aircraft hung from the roof of the Beverley powerhouse. After Ford's death from a car accident in 1963, the people of Beverley created an aviation museum with the Silver Centenary as the featured piece. In 2006, Ford's grandson Rod Edwards retrieved the plane from the museum to enable restoration, which caused much concern to the people of Beverley. As part of the restoration, Mr Edwards decided to obtain airworthy certification for the plane, and in August 2007 the Silver Centenary received its airworthy certificate 77 years after it was originally built.  Construction  Original plans for the Silver Centenary were sketched in chalk on the floor of the Beverley powerhouse in 1928, and from these plans templates were made. With the help of the local butcher Tom Shackle, the frame was crafted out of spruce and maple timber. Tom's sister Elsie sewed all the fabric for the aircraft. As the plane took shape resembling that of a Tiger Moth, Ford undertook an Australia wide search for an engine. During the Western Australian Centenary Air Race in 1929 a competitor crashed in Baandee 120 km from Beverley, and Ford purchased the undamaged engine for ¬£170. This purchase was mentioned in a Sydney Newspaper which brought the project to the attention of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), who sent WA aviation inspector Jim Collopy to inspect the work: Collopy indicated that Ford would need to register the plane and suggested strengthening of the undercarriage. Ford made the modifications and painted the first part of the aircraft registration on the plane. In June 1930 Ford notified the CAA that the plane was ready for its maiden flight. Piloted by Captain C.H. Nesbitt of Western Air Services, the flight took place on 1 July 1930. The plane was towed from the powerhouse along the main street of Beverley to Benson's paddock, and most of the town turned out to watch, although the shire council voiced its disapproval at Ford for taking such a risk. Flights Arriving at Benson's paddock Nesbitt climbed aboard and started the engine. Originally intending just to taxi around the field, Nesbitt was in the air within few seconds. After flying for 25 minutes Nesbitt landed, later remarking that it felt so right he decided to \\"give it the gun\\". Nesbitt then made series of 10-minute joyflights, first with Ford, then Shackles, followed by Ford's sisters Rita and then Elsie. On 4 July Ford with Nesbitt at the controls flew to Northam to meet up with and escort Amy Johnson and de Havilland to Perth. Receiving the news that Johnson had been delayed in Kalgoorlie, Ford and Nesbitt flew onto Maylands Airport where West Australian airways made hangar space available for the Silver Centenary. When Johnson arrived she inspected the Silver Centenary and expressed disappointment that bad weather prevented her from flying the plane. On 14 July the Silver Centenary returned to Beverley, with the shire council congratulating Ford and offering to assist with any further events. Captain Nesbitt died on 4 October 1930 while flying a Puss Moth to Beverley, where he had intended to demonstrate the Silver Centenary at the Beverley show grounds. The Silver Centenary wasn't flown again until April 1931. During these flights the pilot became concerned about the lack of a complete registration number and contacted the CAA. It was revealed that the Silver Centenary was designated as an experimental and had been restricted to flying only within 5 km of Beverley. Ford was unaware of the restriction until that time and then applied for permission to return the plane to Beverley, which occurred in September 1931. Ford applied to have the aircraft licensed but without blue prints, stress charts and other design documents the CAA refused to grant an airworthy certificate. In December 1931, permission was granted for the plane to be flown to Narrogin for an air show conditional that it didn't carry any passengers during the flight and that it wasn't flown during the show. The return flight to Beverley on 6 December 1931 would become Silver Centenary's last flight for almost 76 years. The log books for the Silver Centenary show that it flew for a total of 9 hours 40 minutes across 21 flights, though many of its flights were not recorded. In 1932, permission was sought to use the plane for mining exploration in the goldfields around Kalgoorlie; this was declined. In 1933 Ford returned the plane to the powerhouse, where it hung from the roof until after his death in 1963. Museum In 1962, the Western Australian Museum expressed an interest in buying the Silver Centenary, but with Ford's death in a motor vehicle accident in 1963, the people of Beverley started the Selby Ford Memorial Fund, the purpose of which was to keep the plane in Beverley as a tribute to Ford. In January 1964, the Silver Centenary was lowered from the roof of the powerhouse and a wall was removed enabling the aircraft to be moved. After being cleaned up, the Silver Centenary was put into storage again until completion of the Beverley Aviation Museum in 1967, where it became the feature piece. There is a wonderful interactive display, complete with a 1:5 scale model, exact replica of the silver centenary plane built in Beverley, located at the Beverley Visitor Centre, 141 Vincent Street Beverley, Western Australia. Restoration Shire Crest, with the Silver Centenary In 2006 Rod Edwards, the grandson of Ford and current owner of the Silver Centenary, decided to restore the aircraft. As part of the restoration he undertook the requirement to obtain an airworthy certificate. Since the plane has become an icon of the shire, Edwards' plans caused concern amongst the locals.

Built in the 10th century, the fortress and the small town it protects were ruled by the lords of Baux for five hundred years, in the thick of the ceaseless conflicts that ravaged Provence. It was also at Les Baux that the most famous minstrels and troubadours of the day sang songs of courtly love to the maidens of the House of Les Baux. In the 15th century, the lords of Baux were superseded by the barons of the Masons des Comtes de Provence. This was a golden age for the Ch√¢teau, before it came under the control of the kings of France.

He was shot while carrying out a raid on a Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) barracks at Rosslea in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland. Green was originally from Derry, Northern Ireland, and had been a commando in the British Army. After returning home to Northern Ireland he became involved with Irish republicanism and joined a small splinter group, Saor Uladh, founded by Liam Kelly and Phil O'Donnell. Kelly had been court-martialed from the Irish Republican Army in 1951 for insubordination and then went on to form the new paramilitary group. Saor Uladh was most active in Kelly's home ground of East Tyrone. The group targeted Customs posts and security force installations, their principal objective being the removal of the border and the reunification of Ireland. On the morning of 25 November 1955, Green was the lieutenant who led the raid at Rosslea, blowing up part of the building and storming the ground floor rooms, opening fire as they entered. In the exchange that followed, Green was shot and seriously injured. He was ferried away from Rosslea across the border to a farmhouse near Tydavnet in north County Monaghan, Republic of Ireland. He died the following morning from his injuries and was buried in a nearby cemetery. References * J.

It was formed from infantry brigade reconnaissance groups on 14 January 1941. All the brigade reconnaissance groups of each infantry corps were formed into reconnaissance battalions, each usually bearing the number of its relevant division. For example, the 43rd Battalion, Reconnaissance Corps (based on the 5th Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment) was the divisional reconnaissance battalion of the 43rd (Wessex) Division.Mills, T.F. Land Forces of Britain, the Empire and Commonwealth 5th Battalion, The Gloucestershire Regiment page. Retrieved 26 November 2007. Initially, coming from infantry units, reconnaissance units used the infantry designations of battalions, companies and platoons. However, from 6 June 1942, the Corps changed to the cavalry descriptions of regiments, squadrons and troops. The Corps became part of the Royal Armoured Corps (RAC) in 1944, still maintaining its own cap badge with two lightning strikes supporting an upright spear. With the end of the war, this number of reconnaissance units was not needed and the Reconnaissance Corps was disbanded in August 1946. Reconnaissance duties reverted to regular armoured units of the RAC. Organisation and equipment A Universal Carrier of the 52nd Reconnaissance Regiment of the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division, Scotland, 10 November 1942. The Reconnaissance Corps was charged with gathering vital tactical information in battle for infantry divisions, probing ahead and screening the flanks of main advances. The training centre was established at Winchester in February 1941, until the home of the Corps moved to Catterick in Yorkshire. Although the Corps was raised from various regular army units, it did not follow that all men would be retained, as potential reconnoiterers were required to take an IQ test and other tests before being accepted. Many failed and were sent to normal infantry battalions, but those who succeeded enjoyed the kudos of belonging to an elite unit and were determined to prove their own worth. Before beginning training with his unit, each man undertook a five-week course with technical units, which determined his role as a driver, wireless operator or mechanic. Most recce men became efficient in two of these roles e.g. driver and operator. During training with a reconnaissance unit, emphasis was placed on both aggressiveness and initiative, as these were the characteristics expected of the men selected for such units, and, as a result, a proud offensive spirit was created, similar to other newly founded units such as The Parachute Regiment. Reconnaissance regiments were organised into a headquarters squadron (including anti-tank, signals and mortar troops) and three reconnaissance (or \\"recce\\") squadrons. Each recce squadron comprised three scout troops and an assault troop. Scout troops were equipped with Bren Gun Carriers and light reconnaissance cars, such as the Humber Light Reconnaissance Car. The assault troops were composed of lorried infantry and were called up when enemy resistance needed to be overcome. Later in the war, more efficient and well-armed armoured cars such as the Humber Armoured Car, Daimler Armoured Car, Staghound and Greyhound augmented the light reconnaissance cars in scout troops.A British Soldier Remembers The Logistics of a Recce Regiment (organisation and vehicles pages).

Camp Bullis provides Base Operations Support and Training Support to Joint Base San Antonio. The camp is named for Brigadier General John L. Bullis,Handbook of Texas, Camp Bullis http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qbc06 Camp Bullis and Camp Stanley make up the Leon Springs Military Reservation. Camp Bullis is used primarily as maneuvering grounds for U.S. Army, Air Force and Marines combat units. It is also utilized as a field training site for the various medical units stationed at Brooke Army Medical Center in nearby Fort Sam Houston. History In 1906 United States military bought over 17,000 acres from all or parts of six ranches. This area was designated the Leon Springs Military Reservation and was to be used as a maneuvers and training area for troops based at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio. Leon Springs was praised for its sparse population and varied terrain.Manguso 1990:5 Use of the new training area began almost immediately. In July and August 1907, the target ranges in present-day Camp Stanley were used for the Southwestern Rifle and Pistol Competition. The first major maneuvers were held in 1908, involving regular army and National Guard infantry, cavalry, and field artillery units.Manguso 1990:11, 17 The first documented firing of artillery occurred in 1909. Mobilization of troops in response to upheavals in Mexico in 1911 led to large-scale maneuvers at the Reservation. With the increased tensions along the United States-Mexico border between 1912 and 1916, activity at the Reservation decreased as troops from Fort Sam Houston were deployed along the border. Activity increased again in 1916, as large numbers of troops were called up for training after the raid of Columbus, New Mexico, by Pancho Villa. Also in 1916, a large remount station was built near Anderson Hill in present-day Camp Stanley (Texas).Manguso 1990:21 In February 1917, the facilities at the reservation were renamed Camp Funston in honor of Major General Frederick Funston. In May 1917 while preparing for World War I, Camp Funston established the First Officers Training Camp (FOTC).Manguso 1990:23 Drills and training at the FOTC included practice marches, target practice, and trench warfare training. Officers of the FOTC graduated in August 1917, after which a Second Series Officer Training Camp began.Manguso 1990:23, 33 In October 1917, Camp Funston was renamed Camp Stanley to avoid confusion with Camp Funston in Kansas; additional land to the south was leased and named Camp Bullis in honor of Brigadier General John L. Bullis.Manguso 1990:33 The Camp Bullis cantonment was located across Salado Creek from the old Scheele Ranch. Training facilities at Camp Bullis included cavalry camps, maneuver grounds, and target ranges.Freeman 1994c: 14 Construction of permanent facilities was limited to a camp headquarters, an administrative building, and spaces for rows of mess halls and tents. The 315th Engineer Regiment of the 90th Division constructed rifle ranges and a pistol range between Hogan Ridge and Salado Creek that could easily accommodate 3,000-4,000 men.Manguso 1990:33 Between World Wars I and II, Camp Bullis grew significantly in size. The leased properties of Camp Bullis and additional adjacent properties were purchased. In addition, 1,760 acres of Camp Stanley, primarily the inner cantonment of present-day Camp Stanley, were transferred to the Chief of Ordnance for the San Antonio Arsenal, which was located in the City of San Antonio to the south. The remaining area, formerly known as the Leon Springs Military Reservation, was transferred to Camp Bullis.Freeman 1994c:58Manguso 1990:47 During this period, infantry and engineering units of the 2d Division and other troop units in the San Antonio area used Camp Bullis. Training and drills by the Citizens Military Training Camp (CMTC) and the Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) also took place at Camp Bullis. Troops took part in target and combat practice, firing Stokes mortars, and maneuvering in regiment-sized units.Freeman 1994c:18 Starting in 1937, the Second Division tested new divisional structures meant to increase mobility and flexibility through mechanization and motorization.Manguso 1990:63 These tests, featured in a 1939 LIFE Magazine issueTIME 14 August 1939:46-47 and employed the use of antitank units and the 6th Infantry Regiment, and lasted through 1939. The resulting concept, known as the triangular division was built around three infantry regiments and gave commanders at each level of organization, from platoon to division, three forces to face enemy units: one to confront the enemy, one to maneuver and outflank the enemy, and one to exploit enemy failures or weaknesses and act as a reserve. In 1939, Army Chief of Staff General George C. Marshall ordered that the triangular division design be adopted for all infantry divisions.Hawkins and Carafano 1997:4 The formal reorganization of the Second Division included the addition of the 38th Infantry Regiment, two artillery battalions, and a change from 75-mm to 105-mm howitzers.Manguso 1990:67 In 1942 and 1943, the triangular division was replaced when the need for tank and other armored units became essential parts of division-sized units.Hawkins and Carafano 1997:5, Appendix C Prior to World War II, Camp Bullis had hosted a number of nonmilitary activities. In 1926, portions of two movies‚ÄîThe Rough Riders and Wings‚Äîwere filmed at the installation.Manguso 1990:57 The Rough Riders was filmed using troops of the 1st and 5th Cavalry regiments as extras. Palmtree Hill, which was stormed by the troops, was planted with palm trees to resemble San Juan Hill in Cuba. The flying fields at Camp Bullis were used in the production of Wings, the winner of the first Academy Award for best picture. In the early 1930s, Camp Bullis was one of many military installations across the country used for the organization of Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) personnel.Freeman 1994c:19 Personnel from the CCC, as well as the Works Progress Administration (renamed Work Projects Administration in 1939 WPA), participated in the construction of some of the camp's facilities during this period.Freeman 1994c:22 As the war in Europe began, more and more troops trained at Camp Bullis. This increased the need for a larger training facility that could accommodate more than one division. Properties to the east along Blanco Road and to the northwest were acquired by condemnation, and additional acreage north of Cibolo Creek was leased.Freeman 1994c:64-65Manguso 1990:67Rogers et al. 1940 The new facilities reflected changes in technology, tactics, and increased range of weapons. In addition, adding more tent slabsManguso 1990:75 increased the capacity of the cantonment area. A prisoner-of-war camp with a capacity for 200 prisoners was established north of the headquarters, and access to the camp was improved by the completion of Military Highway. Division-sized units trained at Camp Bullis until November 1943, after which the army did not activate any new divisions. Smaller units continued to train at Camp Bullis until the end of World War II.Manguso 1990:82 Toward the end of World War II, the Provost Marshal General School, including the Military Police Officer Candidate School, moved to Camp Bullis from Fort Sam Houston.Manguso 1990:82, 89 After World War II there was less demand for the ranges and maneuver areas. The postwar period brought changes in infantry division weaponry that were incompatible with the size and location of the facility. Divisions used late- model M-4 Shermans and M-26 Pershings as well as antiaircraft artillery, which \\"could not be fired safely at Camp Bullis with service ammunition\\"Manguso 1990:93 Other developments at the end of the war made Camp Bullis an ideal facility for different activities. Personnel attached to the Government Tire Test used Camp Bullis and its shop facilities to invent and test tires, fuels, vehicles, and tanks for the military.Freeman 1994c:80-81 Medical training also became increasingly important, as Fort Sam Houston became the new home of the Medical Field Service School. Remote training facilities were set up at Camp Bullis so that personnel could practice field medical skills. Camp Bullis continues to train medical personnel in field procedures, as well as provide training facilities for army, army reserve, air force, and Texas National Guard personnel from the San Antonio area and outside the region. Since 1970, Camp Bullis has transferred 464 acres to the City of San Antonio and Bexar County for parks and roads. Water insecurity As of September 2015 the San Antonio Water System (SAWS) plans an $11 million project to build nearly 4 miles of pipeline to Camp Bullis, Fort Sam Houston, and Lackland Air Force Base as a backup water supply.

The names of these three people form the acronym VIBLANDI which was the definitive name of the helicopter. In July 1936 the Spanish Civil War began, and the construction of the helicopter was interrupted until 1940. In September 1941 the helicopter was completed, with testing commencing in October 1941, with unknown results. During the next years Villamil improved the helicopter, registered three more patents, and continued testing the machine. Photographs show the aircraft with a three-bladed rotor of relatively large diameter with a three-bladed tail rotor above the rear fuselage, most sources describe these photographs as the second prototype, but there is no other evidence to suggest that Villamil built a second airframe.

It was built in 1238-41 by Count Frederick III of Leiningen. The French destroyed it in 1690 and it has lain in ruins since that time.  Location  The castle is located on a foothill of the Haardt on the northeastern edge of the Palatinate Forest. Its eponymous village is grouped around the castle, high above the left bank of the Eckbach at an elevation of about 300 metres above sea level. Near the castle is the Old Vicarage (Alte Pfarrey), which was first recorded in 1524 and which houses a gourmet restaurant today.  History  Its name, like that of its sister castle, Altleiningen five kilometres to the southwest, is derived from the Frankish noble family, the counts of Leiningen, who ruled the territory of Leiningerland. The castle was built following a division of inheritance around 1240 by Count Frederick III of Leiningen. Together with, Battenberg Castle, 1,400 metres to the south, the castle controlled the entrance to the Eckbach valley. Passing between various lines of the family, the castle remained the property of the Leiningens for over 200 years. In 1468, Prince-Elector Frederick the Victorious of the Palatinate became involved in inheritance disputes amongst the Leiningens and seized possession of the castle by force. In 1508, after passing through several intermediate arrangements, an agreement was reached: the castle would be divided between the Bishopric of Worms and the counts of Leiningen-Westerburg. The ruins around 1800, copperplate by Jakob Wilhelm Roux In 1525, during the Peasants' War, the castle was opened to the rebellious farmers without a fight and, having been hosted by Countess Eva (1481‚Äì1543) in a friendly and generous way, the farmers left without causing great damage. Local poet, Paul M√ºnch, described this historical episode in his Palatine poem Die Gr√§fin Eva vun Neileininge. ‚Äì Mundartgedicht Even in Thirty Years' War the castle only suffered minor damage. During the War of the Palatine Succession, however, invading French troops razed the entire site in 1690. Its two owners, Leiningen-Westerburg and the Bishopric of Worms, could not agree to rebuild the castle in the period that followed ‚Äì Leiningen being for, and Worms being against, the idea. In 1767, Charles of Leiningen- Westerburg finally sold the Leiningen half to Worms. In the wake of the French Revolution the castle ruins were seized by secular authorities and passed in 1804 into the hands of the municipality of Neuleiningen, who, sold it just four years. In 1874, Charles Emich of Leiningen-Westerburg bought it back again for his family.  Layout  The stepped gable of the palas in the northwest corner of the castle Parish church of St. Nicholas, the old castle chapel, seen from the castle. The castle is of the so-called quadrangular type, with a rectangular ground plan and defensive towers projecting beyond the curtain walls. Contrary to earlier views, the castle was built to the same pattern as French castles of the early 13th century in the √éle-de-France. However, its design was not copied from an existing castle; rather it combined a French design with local building traditions. Most striking are its four, round towers and the large number of very narrow arrow slits (Schlitzscharten), ‚Äì Test der Schlitzscharten auf Funktionalit√§t for bows and crossbows. These Schlitzscharten are amongst the earliest examples on German soil. Thus, apart from Lahr Castle - of which little remains - Neuleiningen is the oldest quadrangular castle in Germany. The internal elements from the first phase of construction have been totally lost and can only be made out here and there from excavations. The present remains date to the 14th to early 17th centuries. The most striking feature of the castle is the stepped gable of the palas on the north side which, in its present guise, goes back to Landgrave Hesso of Leiningen (before 1435‚Äì1467). In the southeast corner the cellar of the Leiningen-Westerburg residence of around 1508 has survived. This is where the Burgsch√§nke inn was established in the second half of the 20th century. Today, the southeast tower is an observation tower that is open to the public. The two upper storeys of this tower have been turned into a small local history museum that exhibits the stoneware products of an old local factory that closed in 1932, as well as other handicrafts. The local village, which is connected to the castle both geographically and historically, was built around the same time (13th century). The coherence and extent of its historic buildings has only a few parallels in the region.  Sights and culture   Viewing point  The Southeast Tower; today a viewing point From the observation tower of the castle there is an outstanding view of the Upper Rhine Valley to the east, the mountains of the Palatinate Forest to the south and west and the massif of the Donnersberg to the northwest. At the foot of the hill village of Neuleiningen is the hamlet of Neuleiningen-Tal and the neighbouring villages of Gr√ºnstadt-Sausenheim and Kleinkarlbach. In clear weather, there are views of Ludwigshafen, Mannheim, and the Odenwald, and planes may even be seen taking off from Frankfurt Airport. Conversely, at night, the illuminated castle is an impressive sight from the A 6 motorway (Saarbr√ºcken‚ÄìMannheim) immediately to the north. In the direction of Mannheim it appears against the backdrop of the densely populated Rhine valley whilst, 20 km behind the castle silhouette, is the well-lit BASF factory in Ludwigshafen.  Events  Neuleiningen Castle, eastern part of the castle with its tavern Since 2004, the courtyard has been the venue for the Neuleiningen Castle Summer Concerts (Neuleininger Burgsommers). On five Saturdays between June and August, open-air concerts are held here. In 2007 the Castle Wine Festival took place within the castle walls for the first time. Organised by local vintners, it has been established as a regular event.

The hospital was founded by Negro physicians who were practicing in the Baltimore area just a year after the founding of the first Black-owned and operated hospital, Provident Hospital of Chicago. Within two years it moved to a larger site at 413 W. Biddle Street. Provident Hospital was one of the first black medical facilities located in Baltimore. Background An all-Black medical facility was in need in the late nineteenth and twentieth century due to Afro-Americans not being allowed or having limited access to medical attention by other hospitals in the area. The idea of a black hospital was a place where a Negro physician could mature in his craft and ladies could become nurses through a nursing school. The idea of a black hospital came to mind prior to the American Civil War. History After 30 years at the Biddle St. site, the hospital relocated to an even larger site, the former Union Protestant Hospital site at 1514 Division Street (Union Protestant Hospital is now known as Union Memorial Hospital and located in North Baltimore City). In 1970, the final site for Provident Hospital was opened at 2600 Liberty Heights Avenue. In 1986, Provident Hospital merged with Lutheran Hospital to address financial issues. The combined hospitals closed down in 1986 and a year later reopened as Liberty Medical Center in 1987 due to lack of funding.\\" In 1996, Liberty Medical Center merged with Bon Secours hospital as a result of continued financial problems, with the Liberty campus closing for good in 1999. Historic preservation and commemoration The historical archives of the Provident Hospital were given to the Maryland State Archives in May 2011. The Bon Secours Health System, Inc./Provident Hospital Archives Collection (MSA SC 5971) was placed on long-term deposit at the Baltimore City Archives, 2615 Mathews Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21218. Researchers may access the material at the Baltimore City Archives during its regular business hours. Photographs from the collection have been placed on Flickr.com for viewing, commenting, and identification. The Bon Secours Health System commemorated the Provident Hospital after its closing with a historical garden and display of memorabilia on the site on the Liberty Hospital campus. The garden, along both Liberty Heights and Towanda Avenue, commemorates not only Provident Hospital, but also Lutheran Hospital (with which Provident merged), and the Liberty Medical Center. The garden was known as Trinity Gardens and was part of the sale of the Liberty Campus to Baltimore City Community College in 2010. A release from Bon Secours Medical system at the time indicated that BCCC intended to preserve Trinity Gardens.

She had been fatally shot twice and left in a field just off U.S. Route 20 near the Genesee River after running away from her home in Brooksville, Florida earlier that year. For more than three decades, she remained unidentified under the name Caledonia Jane Doe or \\"Cali Doe\\" until January 26, 2015, when police in Livingston County, New York announced her identity 35 years after her death. Alexander was 16 years old when murdered, though her age wasn't clear to investigators at the time. Most potential forensic evidence was washed away by heavy rain on the night she died, but they knew she had come to the Caledonia area from a distant, warmer locale because she had tan lines on her upper body. Advances in technology allowed investigators to make use of rapidly improving and new forensic techniques to evaluate trace evidence they had collected and, following a successful DNA extraction from her remains in 2005 and a palynological analysis of Alexander's clothing, they concluded that she had spent time in Florida, southern California, Arizona, or northern Mexico prior to her death. Later analysis of isotopes in her bones would lend further support to this conclusion. In addition, a portrait was made of her based on a facial reconstruction, in the hopes that someone would recognize her image, and it was uploaded to an online public database in 2010. Identification was achieved based on a combination of factors; in 2014, a renewed search for her by a close high school friend and Alexander's half- sister resulted in the filing of a new missing persons report with police in Hernando County, Florida, as she had not been seen or heard from since the late 1970s. The artist of the reconstructed photo, a moderator at the Websleuths online community, notified the Livingston County Sheriff's Office about a potential match between the two pictures, and in 2015 a follow-up mitochondrial DNA (MtDNA) analysis confirmed a match with Alexander's half- sister based on the DNA results from 2005. Alexander's case was well- publicized in the time she was unidentified, and the Livingston County police continued to process thousands of leads from the public. The investigation stalled in 1980, leading county officials to arrange for her burial as \\"Unidentified Girl\\" at Greenmount Cemetery in Dansville, New York. In 1984, serial killer Henry Lee Lucas confessed to the crime, but his statement was not considered credible. The perpetrator remains unidentified. Background Tammy Jo Alexander was born in Atlanta, Georgia on November 2, 1963, and attended high school in Brooksville, Florida. Pamela Dyson, Alexander's half- sister, believes that Alexander left to escape a turbulent household. Dyson had a different father from Alexander, and, after about age 11, she lived with her paternal grandmother. She said that Alexander's biological father was not really part of the younger girl's life; she grew up with their mother and a stepfather. Their mother had become addicted to prescription medication and was emotionally volatile, erupting into temper tantrums. \\"She did prescription drugs,\\" Dyson said of her mother, Barbara. \\"She was suicidal. I think she had issues back then that they didn't diagnose.\\" Alexander's mother, Barbara Jenkins, had worked as a waitress at a truck stop, and was joined by Alexander when she was a teenager. Alexander had a history of running away in this period. Her friend Laura Nowell said that they had sometimes hitchhiked together with truckers, once traveling all the way to California together. When they got there, Nowell called her parents, and they paid for airline tickets for both girls so they could return to Florida. Jenkins died on January 17, 1998, at the age of 56. Her obituary had listed Alexander as deceased, which the family had assumed to be the case by that time. Until the identification, Dyson believed that her half-sister had made a new life somewhere away from her mother and stepfather. She had hoped that it included a happy household, with a husband and children. \\"I thought she just wanted to go away and start all over,\\" Dyson said.  Death and discovery  Alexander was discovered on the morning of November 10, 1979, by a farmer in Caledonia, New York, southwest of the city of Rochester. The farmer saw red clothing in one of his corn fields near the Genesee River and went to investigate, believing that he had spotted a trespassing hunter. Instead, he found the body of a young woman and notified police soon after. Alexander was fully clothed and showed no signs of sexual assault. Investigators initially ruled that she had died from a severe hemorrhage caused by two gunshot wounds, one to the head over the right eye and one to the back. The wound to the head indicated she had apparently not turned or flinched, a common phenomenon of a headshot, and the entry wound suggested complete surprise. With her pockets turned inside out to indicate that any identification she carried had been removed, the investigators later named her \\"Caledonia Jane Doe\\" or \\"Cali Doe\\" as they worked to identify her. The autopsy by the medical examiner indicated that Alexander had first been shot in the head while next to the road bordering the cornfield, at or near a blood spot found on the ground. She was dragged into the cornfield, where she was shot again in the back and left for dead. Heavy rains on the night of Alexander's death washed away a large portion of potential forensic evidence, such as physical and DNA traces of the perpetrator on her body and clothes. Investigation A facial reconstruction of Alexander that was made in 2010. The artist matched this to a real picture of Alexander (shown above). In the 1980s, John York, who had been one of the first Livingston County deputy sheriffs on the scene in 1979, was elected sheriff. He served in the job until 2013, and ensured that the Cali Doe investigation remained active. Before she was identified, Alexander was estimated to have died between the ages of 13 and 19 (born sometime between 1958 and 1967). She was also estimated to be and . Alexander was described as having brown eyes and wavy, light brown shoulder-length hair that had been lightened in the front about four months prior to her death and was growing out. Her hair appeared to have been dyed from blonde to brown, and her toenails were painted with coral-colored polish. Alexander had visible tan lines from a halter top or bikini, indicating that she may have come from a region with abundant October‚ÄìNovember sunshine, as sun tanning beds were uncommon in the 1970s and Upstate New York was not considered warm or sunny enough for such tanning during that period. There were freckles on the back of her shoulders and acne on her face and chest. The teeth were in natural condition, with no restorations or fillings. It did not appear as if she had ever received dental care. Some of Alexander's permanent first and second molars suffered from severe dental caries (cavities and decay). Consistent with her young appearance, none of her permanent third molars (wisdom teeth) had erupted. Her blood type was A‚àí. Several hours before her death, Alexander had eaten sweet corn, potatoes, and boiled, canned ham. This was possibly from a diner in nearby Lima, where a waitress had seen her eating with an adult man. At the time of exhumation, several of the victim's teeth were sent for mineralogical and forensic isotope analysis. The composition of her teeth could be linked to the composition and mineral content of regional drinking water supplies around North America, allowing investigators to determine where she may have been raised. Early results on the dental 18O/16O isotopic oxygen ratio indicated that she may have spent her early years in the south/southwest region of the United States. Alexander was wearing a red nylon-lined man's windbreaker jacket with black stripes down the arms, marked inside with the label \\"Auto Sports Products, Inc.\\", a boy's multicolored plaid button-up shirt with collar, tan corduroy pants (size 7), blue knee socks, white bra (size 32C), and blue panties. She wore brown ripple-soled shoes. The red Auto Sports Products jacket was produced as a one-time promotional item and could not be traced after distribution. She also wore a silver necklace with three small turquoise stones. The necklace had a homemade appearance and resembled replica Native American jewelry made in the southwestern United States. Attached to her pants' front belt loops were two metal keychains, one shaped like a heart with a key-shaped cutout and inscribed with the words, \\"He who holds the Key can open my heart\\", the other shaped like a key meant to fit the cutout in the heart. The keychains were sold at vending machines along the New York State Thruway, leading investigators to conclude that she and her killer had traveled that route.  Pollen evidence  In 2006, forensic palynology was conducted on the clothing worn by the victim. Paul Chambers, a recently hired investigator in the Monroe County, New York medical examiner's office, asked for and received permission to send her clothing to the Palynology Laboratory at Texas A&M; University. Among the types of pollen found on the clothing by the Texas A&M; researchers were grains from Casuarina (Australian pine, or \\"she oak\\"), Quercus (oak), Picea (spruce), and Betula (birch). The clothing pollen grains were compared to a control sample of pollen grains taken directly from the rural New York site where the body had been found in 1979. Oak grows widely all over the U.S., and spruce and birch grow in New York, among many places in the country. But no oak, spruce, or birch pollen grains were found in the control sample, and neither spruce nor birch trees were found growing near the body dump site. The spruce and birch pollen on the unidentified body came from species common in mountainous areas of California. Australian pine is an invasive genus of tree that grows in a limited number of locations in North America: south Florida; south Texas; parts of Mexico; the campuses of the University of Arizona and Arizona State University; and three regions in California: the North Bay of San Francisco, the San Luis Obispo area, and the San Diego area. The tree cannot survive the autumn and winter seasons in the temperate climate of western New York, where the body was found. Thus, investigators knew that Alexander and her clothing had acquired the Casuarina pollen grains at a location other than the dump site. Researchers believed the southern California and San Diego region to be the best geographical pollen print match location for the grains from the clothing. Based on the pollen evidence and the girl's visible tan lines, forensic researchers suggested that she may have been living in the southwestern United States near San Diego, then traveled (perhaps by hitchhiking) through the Sierra Nevada mountains, where spruce and birch grow, passing through Reno, Nevada, and traveled across the country to upstate New York. A 2012 reexamination of the grains concluded, again, that they could have originated only from California, Arizona, or Florida.  Identification  Alexander was formally identified on January 26, 2015, more than 35 years after her discovery. Laurel Nowell, a close friend in high school from Brooksville, Florida, had started trying to reach Alexander in the 2010s by social media. She eventually reached Alexander's half-sister, Pamela Dyson, of Panama City, who knew that she had often run away from home, but Dyson had not lived with her younger half-sister after about age 11. She learned that no one in her family knew anything of Alexander's whereabouts since the girl had left sometime between 1977 and 1979. An ex-boyfriend of the victim verified he'd last seen her in the spring of 1979. It is believed the victim hitched a ride while working as a waitress at the truck stop owned by her parents. Dyson and Nowell became concerned that Alexander had fallen victim to a crime after leaving home. Dyson said that her mother did report Alexander as missing, but she has since believed that, since Alexander had a history of running away and returning, police may not have taken the case seriously. In August 2014, the Hernando County sheriff's office told them no missing persons report had been filed for her, and promptly filed one. Carl Koppelman, a California artist, came across the \\"missing person\\" report on Alexander as a moderator of the Websleuths online community, where volunteers try to solve cold cases including those of unidentified bodies. In 2010, he sketched the portrait of \\"Caledonia Jane Doe\\" and posted it in the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs). In September 2014, he saw the new listing for Alexander and quickly realized that they were the same person. He emailed the Livingston County Sheriff's Office (with copies sent to the NamUs regional administrator, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), and the Hernando County Sheriff's Office) to tell them of the strong resemblance between the two images. Police arranged to take a DNA sample from Dyson. In January 2015, the Monroe County medical examiner's office found that MtDNA from the unidentified body matched that of Dyson, confirming that the victim was her half-sister. A week later on January 26, 2015, the Livingston County sheriff, Thomas Dougherty, announced at a news conference that Caledonia Jane Doe had been identified after 35 years. Dyson said the family decided to keep Alexander buried in the Greenmount Cemetery in Dansville, New York, planning to hold a service there for her. \\"I'm truly glad for the closure,\\" [Dyson] said. \\"But it hurts to know she died that way. It's terrible, nobody should have to be shot and dragged out into the woods.\\" The Dougherty Funeral Home in Livonia, New York said it paid to have the \\"Jane Doe\\" headstone removed and replaced with one reading \\"Tammy Jo Alexander\\". A public ceremony took place on June 10, 2015, when the new headstone, displaying the victim's name and lifespan, was revealed. Approximately one hundred family and community members attended. Dyson and other members of the Alexander family thanked the police and Livingston community for their caring for Alexander and continued efforts to find her killer. Dyson has since urged family members of missing people to enter the subjects into NamUs, saying that this database was critical in achieving her sister's identification.  Perpetrator  A facial composite of the man seen with Tammy Alexander prior to her murder. Sheriff Dougherty has said the investigation would now focus on finding out who killed Alexander. \\"We've always said one of the biggest parts of solving this case is knowing the victim,\\" he told the media. \\"This case is burning hot ... We're going to be working it harder than ever.\\" Former sheriff York later said that more than 10,000 leads had already been investigated in the case. Alexander was seen with a white male between five feet eight and five feet nine inches tall. He was seen driving a tan station wagon and wore black wire-rimmed glasses. The man was stated to be a \\"person of interest\\" in the case, and police continue to seek his identity. The waitress at the diner, who served the pair on the night of Alexander's death, explained the male companion had paid for the meal. In 1984, serial killer Henry Lee Lucas confessed to the murder of the unidentified girl, without identifying her. Investigators could not find sufficient evidence to support his confession. At one time, a now-retired sheriff speculated Christopher Wilder, known for a span of murdering women in the 1980s, may have been responsible. This theory was rooted in his interest in vehicle racing, and Alexander's jacket was of the same brand of merchandise he was known to purchase. Wilder was killed in a police shootout in 1984 before an interview regarding the Alexander case could take place. Police speculate that the murder weapon the killer used was a .38-caliber handgun. Investigators located a spent slug in the dirt underneath the unidentified girl's body, which they compared forensically to hundreds of other bullets fired from confiscated weapons. Despite investigators' efforts to trace weapons from the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Mexico, the slug has not been matched to a specific gun. The FBI posted billboards throughout the country about Alexander's murder in an attempt to gain new information from the public. By the end of February 2015, the Livingston County Sheriff's Department said they had received many more tips since Alexander's identification, enough to develop a scenario of events that led up to the girl's arrival in Caledonia. A trucker from Tennessee reported what police said was a \\"significant\\" lead after he had heard a radio broadcast detailing the case. In March 2015, the department said that Alexander had ties to a former \\"prison ministry\\" in Young Harris, Georgia, which specialized in working with individuals \\"on probation or parole.\\" By early 2016, the police had identified three male persons of interest who had known Alexander, and took male DNA from her clothing. By November 2016, the FBI had reported that none of the three matched the sample from Alexander's clothing, and continued to receive and investigate new leads in the case.  In the media  In the decades she remained unidentified, the case received national attention. It was featured on such television shows as America's Most Wanted. After her discovery, two news organizations in Rochester, New York, partnered to produce a multi-part podcast in May 2016 detailing Alexander's murder and the ongoing investigation called Finding Tammy Jo. It was hosted by reporters Veronica Volk from WXXI News and Gary Craig from The Democrat and Chronicle, who spent a year co-reporting on the case. They had interviewed potential witnesses, law enforcement, and Alexander's family and friends.

Admissions Wade Deacon has a Public Admissions Number of 300 per year and is oversubscribed. It is situated on Birchfield Road (B5419) between the districts of Farnworth (to the north) and Appleton (to the south) and opposite Victoria Park. Widnes railway station is just north of the school, and Widnes Golf Club is next door to the west. It is in the parish of St John, Widnes. History Grammar school It was formerly two grammar schools - Wade Deacon Grammar School for Boys and Wade Deacon Grammar School for Girls. The school was named after Sir Henry Wade- Deacon CBE, Chairman of Lancashire County Council for four years until January 1931, and was one of seven sons of Henry Deacon, an important local industrialist of the United Alkali Company (now Ineos) and friend of Michael Faraday. He died on 29 July 1932 aged 79, being born on 18 October 1852. He left a will of around ¬£75,000. It was designed by Stephen Wilkinson, the architect of Lancashire County Council. It had room for 550 boys and girls. The grand-designed building was made of Ravenhead and multi-coloured rustic bricks with stone dressings. The floors of the main entrance were made marble terrazzo. The main drive from Birchfield Road was finished with Carnforth gravel. The building included two hard tennis courts. It opened as a single mixed grammar school in September 1931 with grounds of . The school separated into separate gender schools in September 1947, next door to each other, with 400 in the boys' school and 450 in the girls' school. It was administered by the Widnes Committee for Education, part of Lancashire Education Committee, based on Lugsdale Road, and later in the 1960s known as the Widnes Excepted District. The girls' school had 700 girls in 1953, 500 in 1958, and 600 from 1967-74. The boys' school had 450 boys in 1953, 600 in 1960, and 700 from 1964-74. Rugby was an important sport at the boys' school. In April 1974, it came under the jurisdiction of Cheshire Education Committee. Comprehensive It became the Wade Deacon High School in September 1974 for ages 11‚Äì16. The headmaster, Mr Ernest High Smith, came directly from the Kingsway County Secondary School, a secondary modern school on Kingsway, which formed the comprehensive with both grammar schools. He left in December 1978. A levels would be taken at Widnes VI Form College or Halton FE College. In April 1998, it was administered by Halton borough.

In the Westminster system, the head of state or his/her representative has the sole prerogative to appoint a new prime minister upon the resignation, dismissal or death of the incumbent prime minister. Invariably, sitting prime ministers who after an election have no reasonable hope of commanding the confidence of parliament will resign rather than face a certain vote of no confidence. If another party has won a majority government, the prime minister will formally advise the appointment of that party's leader as the new prime minister. There is usually no set minimum or maximum amount of time set aside for the transition to take place, but often the incoming head of government will want two or three weeks to put affairs in order and determine who should get cabinet posts, which itself might require more time especially if recounts involving prospective frontbenchers are underway. Typically, the incoming head of government will spend two or three weeks as prime minister-designate before being formally sworn in as prime minister. The situation is more complicated in case of a hung parliament. By law, incumbent prime ministers always have the right to try to win the confidence of the house in a confidence vote. Often, especially if they do not have the most seats, prime ministers will not attempt to remain in office and will instead relinquish power in favour of the leader of the largest party, in which case they becomes prime minister-designate same as if their party had a majority. On the other hand, if a prime minister in such a situation chooses not to resign, the leader of the largest opposition party will not become the prime minister-designate even if his/her party has the most seats. In the latter case, the prime minister must win a vote of confidence to remain in office. If (s)he is immediately defeated in the house, the head of state in most Westminster systems is often expected to refuse a request to dissolve the house. The leader of the largest opposition party therefore could still become prime minister-designate perhaps several weeks after the general election. The term prime minister-elect is sometimes used as a synonym, but in most circumstances it is technically incorrect: a prime minister is usually appointed by the head of state, and not elected to office by the entire nation, as is the case with some presidential polls. However, it has nonetheless seen common use in the media. Terms such as incoming prime minister and prime minister-in-waiting are also sometimes used, although the latter term is also sometimes used prior to an election for a party leader who is leading in the polls and/or has a meaningful chance of winning, or even more generally at any time between elections in reference to any opposition party leader (regardless of his or her party's perceived electoral prospects) and even for future leadership contenders within the current governing party. Under the broader definition, many prime ministers-in-waiting never actually become prime minister. In some countries the role is specifically covered by legislation, in others convention applies before the chosen leader is sworn in. The Australian Electoral Commission, the government authority responsible for the conduct of elections in Australia, notes that \\"it is usually possible for the Prime Minister-elect to claim victory on the night of the election\\". The media sometimes prematurely refers to someone as a Prime Minister- designate where the broader term of Prime Minister-in-waiting would be more suitable. Common circumstances when this happens include upcoming leadership elections where there is only one candidate and/or a clear majority of eligible voters in the election have pledged to vote for a particular candidate. For example, in the United Kingdom during the 2007 Labour Party leadership election, Gordon Brown was referred to as the Prime Minister- designate even before the Leadership elections had confirmed him in that position. Some reporters have suggested that in such circumstances, the term prime minister-presumptive would be more suitable than either \\"in-waiting\\" or \\"designate\\" since the prospects of accession are typically similar to that of an heir presumptive in a monarchy or a presumptive nominee in a United States presidential election. The title \\"Premier-designate\\" often has the same meaning in governments that use the title \\"Premier\\" to describe a role equivalent to a Prime Minister.  Constitutionally specified roles  In Israel between 1996 and 2001 (when direct prime-ministerial elections were held) the role and duration of the Prime Minister-elect was prescribed by legislation: within 45 days of the publication of the election results (which were published eight days after elections) the Prime Minister-elect would have appeared before the Knesset, presented the Ministers of the Government, announced the division of tasks and the guiding principles of the government's policies, and, after receiving a vote of confidence, enter into office. In 2001, the Knesset voted to change the system of direct prime-ministerial elections and restore the one-vote parliamentary system of government that operated until 1996, approving a reformed version of the original Basic Law: The Government 1968. This new law entered into effect with the January 2003 elections. and In the Solomon Islands, the country's constitution provides a fourteen-day period between the date of the general election and the selection of the Prime Minister. During this period, aspiring candidates for Prime Minister lobby intensely to acquire the numbers needed to win the contest and form the government. The individual successfully voted to form government is the Prime Minister-designate until sworn in by the Governor-General.

The lyrics of the film were also by Habib Tanvir. The film starred Smita Patil, Lalu Ram, Madanlal and Habib Tanvir. Synopsis The film is derived from a classic folk tale, originally narrated by Vijaydan Detha, and interpreted as folk play by Habib Tanvir. The film charts the tumultuous life of a petty thief, Charandas (Lalu Ram). Curiously he is a man of principles ‚Äì an honest thief with a strong sense of integrity and professional efficiency. He makes four vows to his Guru, that he would never eat in a gold plate, never lead a procession that is in his honour, never become a king and never marry a princess, thinking all of them are far out possibilities for him. Later, his guru adds a fifth one - never to tell a lie and sets him of on his life's journey which leads him to a kingdom, where the turn of events make him famous, and eventually he is offered the seat of political power which he has to refuse. Later, the local princess (Smita Patil) gets enchanted by him, and proposes to marry him. This is when his refusal costs him his life. As he is put to death, he illustrates the inherent paradox in human existence, where truthful existence becomes an impossibility, for the truthful and the accidentally truthfuls, alike.

French attempts to invade Ireland in order to destabilise the United Kingdom or as a stepping-stone to Great Britain had already occurred in 1796. The first French Army of England had gathered on the Channel coast in 1798, but an invasion of England was sidelined by Napoleon's concentration on campaigns in Egypt and against Austria, and shelved in 1802 by the Peace of Amiens. Building on planning for mooted invasions under France's Ancien R√©gime in 1744, 1759 and 1779, preparations began again in earnest soon after the outbreak of war in 1803, and were finally called off in 1805. Contrary to popular belief, the invasion was called off before the Battle of Trafalgar. French preparations Inspection of troops at Boulogne, 15 August 1804 Drop Redoubt, part of the Dover Western Heights complex From 1803 to 1805 a new army of 200,000 men, known as the Arm√©e des c√¥tes de l'Oc√©an (Army of the Ocean Coasts) or the Arm√©e d'Angleterre (Army of England), was gathered and trained at camps at Boulogne, Bruges and Montreuil. A large \\"National Flotilla\\"The National Flotilla is also called the \\"Boulogne flotilla\\" in some sources (Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition article \\"Soignies\\") of invasion barges was built in Channel ports along the coasts of France and the Netherlands (then under French domination as the Batavian Republic), right from √âtaples to Flushing, and gathered at Boulogne. This flotilla was initially under the energetic command of Eustache Bruix, but he soon had to return to Paris, where he died of tuberculosis in March 1805. The part of the flotilla built by the Batavian Navy was under the command of vice-admiral Carel Hendrik Ver Huell. Port facilities at Boulogne were improved (even though its tides made it unsuitable for such a role) and forts built, whilst the discontent and boredom that often threatened to overflow among the waiting troops was allayed by constant training and frequent ceremonial visits by Napoleon himself (including the first ever awards of the Imperial L√©gion d'honneur).Chandler, David G. The Campaigns of Napoleon. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1995. , p323 A medal was struck and a triumphal column erected at Boulogne to celebrate the invasion's anticipated success. However, when Napoleon ordered a large-scale test of the invasion craft despite choppy weather and against the advice of his naval commanders such as Charles Ren√© Magon de M√©dine (commander of the flotilla's right wing), they were shown up as ill-designed for their task and, though Napoleon led rescue efforts in person, many men were lost. Cartoon on the invasion, showing a tunnel under the Channel and a fleet of balloons Napoleon also seriously considered using a fleet of troop-carrying balloons as part of his proposed invasion force and appointed Marie Madeline Sophie Blanchard as an air service chief, though she said the proposed aerial invasion would fail because of the winds. (France's first military balloon had been used in 1794 by Jean-Marie Coutelle.) Though an aerial invasion proved a dead-end, the prospect of one captured the minds of the British print media and public. These preparations were financed by the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, whereby France ceded her huge North American territories to the United States in return for a payment of 50 million French francs ($11,250,000). The entire amount was spent on the projected invasion. The United States had partly funded the purchase by means of a loan from Baring Brothers, a British bank, which essentially meant that the British were funding an invasion of themselves.The Louisiana Purchase, Thomas J. Fleming, John Wiley & Sons Inc. 2003, (p.129-130) For his planned subsidiary invasion of Ireland Napoleon had formed an Irish Legion in 1803, to create an indigenous part of his 20,000-man Corps d'Irelande.

John Bull, a national personification of England, holds the head of Napoleon Bonaparte after a conjectured French invasion. 1803 caricature by James Gillray. Though the fleet-test was unsuccessful, Britain continued to be on high alert with defences from invasion. With the flotilla and encampment at Boulogne visible from the south coast of England, Martello towers were built along the English coast to counter the invasion threat, and militias were raised. In the areas closest to France new fortifications were built and existing ones initiated against the 1779 invasion completed or improved. Dover Castle had tunnels added to garrison more troops, the Dover Western Heights were constructed (with a Grand Shaft to deploy its troops from its hilltop site to sea level rapidly should a landing occurWestern Heights ‚Äì Heritage factsheet ‚Äì White Cliffs Country ), and the Royal Military Canal cut to impede Napoleon's progress into England should he land on Romney Marsh. Unfounded rumours of a massive flat French invasion raft powered by windmills and paddle-wheels, a secretly-dug channel tunnel and an invasion fleet of balloons spread via the print media, as did caricatures ridiculing the prospect of invasion. A naval raid on Boulogne was also carried out in October 1804 and British fleets continued to blockade the French and Spanish fleets that would be needed to gain naval superiority long enough for a crossing. Naval plan Before the flotilla could cross, however, Napoleon had to gain naval control of the English Channel ‚Äì in his own words, \\"Let us be masters of the Channel for six hours and we are masters of the world.\\" He envisaged doing this by having the Brest and Toulon Franco-Spanish fleets break out from the British blockade (led at Brest by Collingwood and Toulon by Nelson), and then sail across the Atlantic to threaten the West Indies. This, he hoped, would draw off the Royal Navy force under William Cornwallis defending the Western Approaches. The Toulon and Brest fleets (under Pierre-Charles Villeneuve and Honor√© Joseph Antoine Ganteaume respectively) could then rendezvous at Martinique, quickly sail back across the Atlantic to Europe (losing both these pursuing British fleets en route), land a force in Ireland (as in the two French Revolutionary invasions of Ireland in 1796 and 1798) and, more importantly, defeat what parts of the Channel Fleet had remained in the Channel, take control of the Channel and defend and transport the invasion force, all before the pursuing fleets could return to stop them. This plan was typical of Napoleon in its dash and reliance on fast movement and surprise, but such a style was more suited to land than to sea warfare, with the vagaries of tide and wind and the effective British blockade making it ever more impractical and unlikely to succeed as more and more time passed. Only the Toulon force eventually broke out (on 29 March 1805) and, though it managed to cross the Atlantic, it did not find the Brest fleet at the rendezvous and so sailed back to Europe alone, where it was met by the force blockading Rochefort and Ferrol (where invasion vessels had been prepared), were defeated at the Battle of Cape Finisterre and forced back into port. Therefore, on 27 August 1805 Napoleon used the invasion army as the core of the new Grande Arm√©e and had it break camp and march eastwards to begin the Ulm Campaign. Thus, by the time of the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October, the invasion had already been called off, and so this battle further guaranteed British control of the Channel rather than preventing the invasion. The comment attributed to First Lord of the Admiralty Lord St. Vincent ‚Äì \\"I do not say they [the French] cannot come ‚Äì I only say they cannot come by sea\\" ‚Äì had been proved right.It is attributed to him in a statement by him to House of Lords, though there is no definite evidence he actually said it. Memorial Today, the Boulogne camp's site is marked by a high column (the tallest of such columns in France), built in the 1850s, with a statue of Napoleon on top, panels on the base showing him presenting medals of the L√©gion d'Honneur to his troops and surrounded by railings decorated with the golden French Imperial eagle. The arsenal from the camp is preserved.

Biography He was born in Ybycu√≠ on May 14, 1907, son of Crescencia Cardozo Caballero. He started his music education with the flute player Eloy Mart√≠n P√©rez, in his home town. He continued his studies with Juan J. Rojas and the first instruments that he played were the flute and the guitar. In Asunci√≥n, he joined the Police Band of the Capital, working under the direction of the masters Nicolino Pellegrini and Salvador Dentice. He made artistic tours around countries and cities of the region, finally stopping in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he settled to live and continue his studies with the greatest masters of harmony and compositions and instrumentation, Isidro Maistegui and Gilardo Gilardi. With the Argentinian folk specialist Juan Alfonso Carrizo he began his studies of folk science. During the time of his military instruction he met Eladio Mart√≠nez, who he played with a duet \\"Mart√≠nez-Cardozo\\", which recorded an important quantity of discs for Odeon studios of Buenos Aires where he also performed many presentations at theatres, radios and cultural centers. In 1932, due to the beginning of the Chaco War between Paraguay and Bolivia, the duet \\"Mart√≠nez-Cardozo\\", together with other artists, made successful acting to gather money for the Paraguayan Red Cross. At the end of the war, in Buenos Aires, the Paraguayan Circle is founded, and the \\"Mart√≠nez-Cardozo\\" are active members, and little by little Cardozo Ocampo begins \\"√ëand√© Rog√°\\", an important music work which later will end up being the foundation of \\"Guaran√≠ Folk Group\\" and then \\"Folk Club Rincon Guaran√≠\\". He wrote and directed radio cycles about Paraguayan music and culture by the Radio Argentina of Buenos Aires (between 1948 and 1952). He was the creator of \\"Banda Ocara\\" (1954‚Äì1957) in Asuncion. He organized several Paraguayan music concert cycles leading the Orquesta Estable of L.R.1, Radio Splendid, in the Argentinian capital, for two seasons (1961‚Äì1962). He was Folk teacher of the Institute of Fine Arts Romaro, Buenos Aires, between 1959 and 1965. He was one of the founders of the Argentinian Society of Authors and Composers, having been a member of the Authors and Composers Circle, and from the fusion of both the SADAIC appeared in 1936. This group named him as delegate before the President of the Paraguayan Republic to deal the issuing of a protectionist law of the intellectual properties; the Decree-law number 94 was a result of this, inscribed by the President Federico Ch√°vez. Positions in favor of art Among his many activities in the musical work, the Folk science and the union work in favor of musicians, we can also mention his work as a secretary of APA (Paraguayan Authors Association) member of the Paraguayan Musicians Association, member of the Guaran√≠ Language and Culture Academy, member of the Paraguayan Indian Association, chief of the Folk department of the Paraguayan General Tourism Direction, folk advisor for the Town Hall of Asuncion, honor president of APROFON (Paraguayan Association Phonograms Producers), folk advisor of IFAP (Paraguayan Folk players Association).

His artistic style He dedicated specially to the music composition of folk inspiration on Paraguayan rhythms. His work, of great value, stands out for the popular feeling understanding of the country man, as well as for the sensitivity of the melodic and harmonic treatment, which for the Master, according to his own saying, was \\" a musical honor matter \\".

The 100 point system applies to individuals opening new financial accounts in Australia, including bank accounts or betting accounts. Points are allocated to the types of documentary proof of identity that the person can produce, and they must have at least 100 points of identification to be able to operate an account. The system now also applies to the establishment of a number of official identity documents, such as an Australian passport and driving licence.Transport for NSW - 100 Point Check Additionally, 100 point checking also applies in superannuation. Members are required to provide 100 points of ID when applying to transfer their accumulation funds (receiving monies) to a pension-based fund (paying monies). \\"Reporting entities\\" are required to identify their customers using the 100 point check system. Accounts may be opened, but can only be operated (i.e. withdrawals made) by an identified customer; and an unidentified customer is blocked from making withdrawals. Generally, identification can be transferred from one account to another, so that for instance a person once identified does not need to produce documents again when opening a second account at the same institution. An issue for many Australian organisations is the capture of credit card primary account numbers (PANs), referred to below under the 25 points section as credit cards or EFTPOS cards. This practice is not compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard and must be removed from all 100 point check forms. Documents Primary documents 70 points Only one of the following may be claimed: * Birth certificate * Birth card issued by a registry of births, deaths and marriages * Citizenship certificate * Current passport * Expired passport which has not been cancelled and was current within the preceding two years * Other document of identity, having the same characteristics as a passport including diplomatic documents and some documents issued to refugees Secondary documents 40 points * Document issued by authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs), banks, building societies, credit unions or registered corporations.

The signatory must have been known to the referee for at least twelve months. ** Another financial body certifying that the signatory is a known customer ** Another customer who has been verified as a signatory by the cash dealer ** An acceptable referee (refer to AUSTRAC Guideline No. 3 and Information Circular No. 3) * Any of the following, which must contain a photograph and a name.
