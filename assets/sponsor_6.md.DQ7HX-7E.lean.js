By the end of World War II in Europe, General Graham had flown 73 combat missions in North American P-51 Mustang fighter aircraft and had become an ace 7 enemy aircraft in aerial combat plus 9.5 more while strafing airfields, to his credit, while flying with the 355th Fighter Group. In addition, he had one probable and 10 damaged. He was assistant chief of staff for operations, VIII Fighter Command, from October 1945 until February 1946. After four months as a civilian with the Socony Vacuum Company of Venezuela, he returned to active military duty with the U.S. Army Air Corps in September 1946 as deputy assistant for operations, Tenth Air Force, at Brooks Field. He later served as commander of Reserve training detachments at Brooks and Carswell fields, Texas. In 1947, Graham entered the University of Pittsburgh under the Air Force Institute of Technology program, earning a master of science degree in 1948. In his next two assignments, General Graham was industrial mobilization training consultant to the Union Oil Company of California and the Shell Oil Company. Between September 1949 and December 1954, Graham served as chief of the Target Analysis Division in the Office of the Director of Intelligence at Headquarters U.S. Air Force and then as director of targets in the Directorate of Intelligence, Headquarters Far East Air Forces in Japan, during the Korean War Graham returned to the United States in January 1955 and served first as deputy commander and then from October 1955 as commander of the 31st Strategic Fighter Wing at Turner Air Force Base. As commander, he performed the navigation for his wing's lead element during \\"Operation Left Hook,\\" a Strategic Air Command fighter wing bombing and navigation competition. The 31st Strategic Fighter Wing won the navigation and maintenance trophies and took second place honors among the seven wings entered in the competition. Graham led a series of F-84 Thunderjet jet aircraft \\"Oil Burner\\" missions which demonstrated that nonstop air refueled, day and night long-range deployments in fighter aircraft were practical. In 1958 he led the first nonstop deployment of F-100 Super Sabre aircraft from the United States to Europe, and he was captain of the 31st Tactical Fighter Wing team which won the Tactical Air Command Fighter Weapons Meet and placed second in worldwide tactical fighter weapons competition. In January 1959 he returned to Headquarters U.S. Air Force as chief of the Tactical Division and later was director of operational forces in the Directorate of Operations.

A monk, in 944 he supported the assumption of sole rule by Constantine VII, and was allowed to leave the monastery and enter imperial service. He held a succession of senior military commands, fighting in southern Italy against local rebels and the Fatimids, and in the Balkans against the Magyars. In 963, he tried to oppose the takeover of the imperial throne by the general Nikephoros Phokas by assuming control over Constantinople and arresting his father, Bardas Phokas the Elder. During the ensuing clashes, he was hit on the head by a platter, and died on the next day, 16 August 963.  Life   Origin and the palace coups of 944  solidus of Romanos I with Constantine VII Marianos was the eldest son of the general Leo Argyros, active in the first decades of the 10th century. He had a brother, Romanos Argyros, who in 921 married Agathe, a daughter of Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos (). The Argyroi therefore were counted among the firmest supporters of the Lekapenos regime. Romanos Lekapenos had risen to power in 919 as regent over the young Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos (), whom he married to his daughter Helena. By December 920, his position had become so unassailable that he was crowned senior emperor. To consolidate his hold on power, and possibly aiming to supplant the ruling Macedonian dynasty with his own family, Romanos raised his eldest son Christopher to co-emperor in 921, while the younger sons Stephen and Constantine were proclaimed co-emperors in 924. Christopher died in 931, and as Constantine VII remained sidelined, Stephen and Constantine assumed an increased prominence, although formally they still ranked after their brother-in-law in the college of emperors. However, in 943, the elderly Romanos drafted a will which would leave Constantine VII as the senior emperor following his death. This greatly upset his two sons, who started planning to seize power through a coup d'√©tat, with Stephen apparently the ringleader and Constantine a rather reluctant partner. It is in this context that Marianos Argyros is first mentioned in December 944. At the time, he was a monk, and a confidant of Stephen Lekapenos. According to the 11th-century historian John Skylitzes, he had earlier been honoured and trusted by Romanos, but Marianos nevertheless supported the coup of the Lekapenoi brothers on 20 December, which successfully deposed their father and exiled him to a monastery on the island of Prote. A few weeks later, however, with the support of the populace, Constantine VII managed to sideline the Lekapenoi, who joined their father in exile. It appears that Marianos had changed sides in time, for he participated in the arrest of the Lekapenoi. As a reward, Constantine VII, now sole ruler, freed him of his monastic vows and raised him to the rank of patrikios and the post of Count of the Stable. His abandonment of the monastic habit earned him the nickname \\"Apambas\\" or \\"Apabbas\\" (), whose etymology is unclear.  Command in southern Italy  Map of Byzantine southern Italy (yellow) at the end of the 10th century Marianos then disappears from the scene until he was sent at the head of troops from the themes of Macedonia and Thrace in an expedition to southern Italy, dated by modern scholars to 955. A rebellion that had broken out in the local Byzantine themes of Langobardia and Calabria, involving also the imperial vassal city-state of Naples. The Byzantine expeditionary force encircled and besieged Naples, until the city surrendered. Marianos then took over the governance of the Byzantine provinces of Italy: in 956, he is attested as strategos (governor) of Calabria and Langobardia in a charter of privilege for the monastery of Monte Cassino. At about the same time, following a Fatimid raid on Almeria, war had broken out between the Fatimids and the Umayyad Caliphate of Cordoba. Fatimid sources report that the Umayyads proposed joint action with Byzantium, but Marianos appears to have been focused on suppressing the rebellion rather than engaging in war with the Fatimids. Byzantine envoys even went to the Fatimid caliph, al-Mu'izz, and offered to renew and extend the existing truce. Al-Mu'izz however, determined to expose the Umayyads' collaboration with the infidel enemy and emulate the achievements of his father, refused. The Caliph dispatched new forces to Sicily under Ammar ibn Ali al-Kalbi and his brother al-Hasan ibn Ali al-Kalbi. In spring/summer 956, the Fatimid fleet clashed with and defeated the Byzantine fleet in two battles in the Straits of Messina, followed by Fatimid raids on the Calabrian coast. In the aftermath of these raids, Marianos travelled to the Fatimid court in person, and sought a truce in exchange for the resumption of a payment of tribute and the annual release of prisoners of war taken in the East. Al-Mu'izz agreed to these terms, but warfare resumed soon after, when the Byzantine admiral Basil destroyed the mosque built by the Fatimids at Rhegion and raided Termini. Marianos therefore returned to the Fatimid court in a second embassy in 957, going first through Sicily, where he apparently delivered to the local Fatimid governor, Ahmad ibn al-Hasan al- Kalbi, the agreed tribute. During the reception by al-Mu'izz, Marianos presented a letter by Constantine VII confirming the terms agreed during the first embassy, but this time al-Mu'izz rejected the terms. As a result of the breakdown in these negotiations, Constantine VII sent a massive expedition to Italy under admirals Krambeas and Moroleon, while Marianos commanded the land troops. The Fatimids under the Kalbid brothers al-Hasan and Ammar were victorious over Marianos, but following the arrival of the Byzantine reinforcements the Fatimid fleet left Calabria, only to suffer a shipwreck on its return to Sicily. Marianos is no longer mentioned in Italy after that, although he may have led a third embassy to al-Mu'izz in September 958, which led to the conclusion of a five-year truce between the two powers.  Command in the Balkans and death  In ca. 959/961, he defeated a raid by the Magyars into Thrace, taking many of them prisoner. In connection with this operation, Theophanes Continuatus refers to him as \\"monostrategos of the theme of Macedonia and katepano of the West\\", a position equivalent to that of the Domestic of the Schools of the West, in command of all the \\"western\\" (European) troops. It is unclear, however, whether this means a permanent appointment or was an ad hoc position, i.e. as strategos of Macedonia and temporary overall commander of detachments from the other European themes. The latter is more likely, as it is documented that Leo Phokas the Younger held the post of Domestic of the West, but was fighting against the Arabs in the east at the time. Histamenon of Nikephoros Phokas and Basil II On 15 March 963, Emperor Romanos II () unexpectedly died, leaving his young sons Basil II and Constantine VIII as emperors. The powerful general Nikephoros Phokas (the brother of Leo) decided to seize the throne for himself, but was opposed by the parakoimomenos and guardian of the young emperors, Joseph Bringas. Seeking support, Bringas offered Marianos the high command in the east and potentially even the throne if he would aid him. Marianos first suggested trying to win over Nikephoros Phokas' popular nephew and lieutenant, the strategos of the Anatolics John Tzimiskes. The latter not only refused, but took his letter straight to his uncle, who summoned his armies to Caesarea and had them proclaim him emperor in early summer. As Phokas' army advanced across Asia Minor on Constantinople, Marianos tried to stage a coup in Constantinople with men of the Macedonian regiments and armed prisoners of war. This move was opposed by the populace, resulting in clashes in the streets. The populace became especially enraged when Marianos tried to forcibly remove the Phokades' elderly father, Bardas, from the Hagia Sophia, where he had sought sanctuary, on 15 August. Marianos was reportedly hit on the head by a platter, thrown by a woman from a nearby house roof. Mortally wounded, he died on the next day. Phokas' supporters rapidly prevailed thereafter. Bringas was forced to flee himself to the Hagia Sophia, and on 16 August Nikephoros Phokas was crowned senior emperor as guardian of Basil and Constantine.

He was one of the leaders of the 1819‚Äì1820 rebellion against the Russian Empire and ended his days in exile in the Ottoman Empire.  Family background  Vakhtang was a son of Prince Rostom, a natural son of King David II, by Mariam Mikeladze. Rostom's status of a prince royal was recognized by the Russian Empire after extension of its protectorate over the Kingdom of Imereti in 1804. Vakhtang had a younger brother, Tariel, and probably a sister, Atato. The brothers were also known by the surname Bagration-Davydov, although, in the Russian Empire, the title of Princes Bagration-Davydov was officially confirmed in 1849 to another, Kakhetian line of the Bagrationi dynasty ‚Äî Bagration-Davitishvili. The homonymy has led to some confusion in the genealogical literature as some scholars such as Cyril Toumanoff erred in making Solomon Bagration-Davydov‚Äîa son of Prince Rostom Bagration- Davitishvili‚Äîa son of Rostom, a natural son of King David II of Imereti.  Rebellion  Vakhtang's involvement in politics first became visible in 1819, nine years after the Russians deposed his relative, King Solomon II and annexed Imereti. That year, what initially began as a protest against the Russian government's encroachment on the church in Imereti, escalated into a full-scale rebellion, involving nobles and peasants alike. Vakhtang, joined by other Imeretian royals such as Prince David and Prince Rostom, became one of the leaders of the movement, which quickly spread into neighboring Guria and Mingrelia. The Russian authorities declared him outlaw and ordered his family be placed under arrest. By July 1820, General Velyaminov succeeded in restoring most of Imereti to the Russian rule. The rebel princes withdrew into the mountains of Racha, where their forces were finally defeated. Prince David was killed in battle; Rostom was captured and deported to Russia's interior; Vakhtang fled to the Ottoman Empire, bringing with him his younger brother, Tariel. His mother, wife Dona Lordkipanidze, and daughter Anastasia, were seized by the Russian military and sent to Tiflis.  Exile  Fleeing from Imereti, Vakhtang and Tariel arrived in Akhaltsikhe and eventually settled in Trebizond, the city where Solomon II, the last king of Imereti, ended his days in exile. They lived on a pension granted by the Ottoman government. The Georgian historian Manana Khomeriki found a draft document in the Ottoman Archives in Istanbul, produced after the death of Solomon II in 1815. The document is a sultan's firman confirming a new vassal ruler in Imereti, but the name field is left blank, apparently due to the lack of a suitable candidate at that time. Another Ottoman document, from c. 1821, mentions Vakhtang as khan of Imereti. Khomeriki conjectures that the Ottomans, vying with Russia for influence in western Caucasus, recognized the exiled Imeretian prince as a legitimate ruler of his country. During his exile, Vakhtang was in correspondence with anti-Russian opposition and sought allies in both Turkey and Iran. His brother Tariel (died 1840) appears to have been in the Ottoman military as a high-ranking officer. In his last years, Vakhtang attempted to negotiate with the Russian authorities his safe return to Imereti, but he died, in December 1850, in the small town of Pulathane (now Ak√ßaabat, Turkey). His only daughter, Anastasia, lived in Georgia. His alleged descendants in Turkey, the Haydar-Beys, are poorly documented.

This commentary has been written by Nasir al-Din al-Tusi in defense of the philosophy of Fakhr Razi. Author Abu Ja'far Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, (b. ·π¨us, 17 February 1201/d. Baghdad, 25 June 1274), honored as polymath and vizier, whose significant works in literary, theological and scientific disciplines later earned him the title of Mu'allim al-Thalith, i.e., the third teacher, following Aristotle and Farabi. About Isharat Al-isharat wa al-tanbihat is the last book written by Avicenna and the most prominent one. The book is on logic, natural philosophy and theology and metaphysics. Al-isharat wa al- tanbihat could be considered generally as a later work and therefore an expression of Avicenna's mature thought. Ibn sina advice that book to his disciples as a kind of work book. In this book ibn Sina try to offer suggestion by which he call for his disciples to establish in the right way the conclusions and/or the premises to reach conclusions. In other words, Avicenna doesn't intend to develop fully articulated arguments in Al-isharat wa al-tanbihat. This makes it very abstract and a demanding text for any reader.Shams C. Inati, Ibn Sina's Remarks and Admonitions: Physics and Metaphysics: An Analysis and Annotated Translation, Columbia University Press, 2014, 218pp., ,Reviewed by Jules Janssens, De Wulf-Mansion Centre, KU Leuven The book Sharh Al-isharat wa al-tanbihat or commentary of Al-isharat wa al-tanbihat is a collection of books written by Nasir ad-Din al-Tusi for detailing and defending of Avicenna's work in front of fakhr Razi. According to Hosein Nasr, the influence of Fakhr al-Din al-Razi and his technical discussions of later Islamic philosophy was not recognized until now. Razi had important attack against peripatetic philosophy. This attack manifested in detail in the book of sharh al-Isharat which is written in the criticism of Avicenna's al-Isharat. Nasir al-Din has written the responses that resuscitated Avicennian philosophy. In the fourteenth century, this central debate was carried further by Qubal-Din al-Razi in his al-Muhakamat (Trials), in which he sought to judge between the commentaries of Fakhr al-Din al-Razi and al-Tusi.Nasr, Seyyed Hossein,2006,p.p113-114 this collection until day counted as the most commentary on the book of admonitions and remarks and later men of wisdom had explain and develop it. Avicenna‚Äôs Al-isharat wa al- tanbihat was well known in philosophical circles, and numerous commentaries, glosses, and summaries had been written on it. One of the earliest commentaries was perhaps Shahrastani‚Äôs (d. 445/1153) polemical I'tiqadat 'alkalam al-isarat, to which 'Umar ibn Sahlan as-Sawi (d. ca. 549/1145) eventually wrote a reply. Fakhr al-Din ar-Razi (d. 606/1209) then wrote his famous Sarh al-Isharat and an abridged version of its essential theses, titled Lubab al-Isharat. Sa'd ibn Oasan ibn Hibat Allah (Muhammad) Ibn Kammuna al- Isra'ili (d. 676/1277) wrote a sharh to the al-Isharat. Nasir ad-Din al-Tusi (672/1274) wrote a sharh to the al-Isharat, as well as Hall Mushkilat al- Isharat. Although a number of these scholars knew Persian, these works were all written in Arabic, and no Persian medieval translation of al-Isharat has been recorded by Brockelmann.Roxanne D. Marcotte, Resurrection (ma'ad) in the Persian 'Hayat An-Nufus' of Isma'il Ibn Muhammad Rizi: The Avicennan Background, in Interpreting Avicenna: Science and Philosophy in Medieval Islam (Leiden: Brill, 2004), 213-235 T≈´sƒ´ wrote supercommentaries on RƒÅzƒ´‚Äôs commentary. Their supercommentaries sought to demonstrate a critical distance from RƒÅzƒ´‚Äôs Sharh, rather than a critical distance from Avicenna‚Äôs IshƒÅrƒÅt. Somewhat less aggressively, T≈´sƒ´ levels accusations at RƒÅzƒ´ that RƒÅzƒ´ had earlier leveled at Mas'≈´dƒ´: of offering criticisms presumptuously, of not yet having worked hard enough to understand Avicenna‚Äôs theories and arguments fully and thereby present them fairlym In the preface to his Hall MushkilƒÅt al-IshƒÅrƒÅt, after praising Avicenna extravagantly and singling out the IshƒÅrƒÅt as an expression of Avicenna‚Äôs ideas referred to by Tusi.Robert Wisnovsky / Oriens 41 (2013) 349‚Äì378 Content This seminal work on Peripatetic philosophy established him beyond doubt as the greatest Avicennan philosopher after the master himself. This category of the works include his rebuttals to the criticisms of Ibn Sina by al-Shahrastani‚Äôs al-Musara'at and Razi‚Äôs earlier critical commentary upon Ibn Sina‚Äôs Al-isharat wa al-tanbihat. Known also as Sharh al-isharat, this work, which is a major philosophical masterpiece in both form and content, resuscitated Ibn Sina‚Äôs teachings once and for all in the East. Devoted to expounding the teachings of the master in this work refrained from expressing any views of his own except when it came to God‚Äôs knowledge of the world, where Nasir Al Din accepted the views of Suhraward, which he also knew well. The work became so famous that it in turn became the subject of many later commentaries, the most famous by Qutb al-Din al- Raz.Seyyed Hossein Nasr,2006.p.187 References Islamic philosophical texts 13th-century Arabic books Medieval philosophical literature Avicenna ","title":"Sharh al-isharat"},{"id":"47087865","text":"Rustam Rezoyevich Abdulov (; born 29 March 1973) is a former Russian football player.

His father Robert Clifton Brackins JR. owned a music studio in the Bay Area. During an interview, Brackins discretely recalls being around artists such as Tony Tony Tony while with his father in the studio. Brackins did not, however, begin to take music seriously until his freshman year of high school when he connected with music producer Nic Nac through a mutual friend. The two began working on music together, after discovering Nic Nac's ability to produce instrumentals, and Brackins' ability to create and write lyrics and melodies. After Graduating high school, Brackins attended San Jose State University, but dropped out and moved to Los Angeles, California where he currently resides. Career Brackins musical career began after he formed a band with a group of local friends called \\"Go Dav\\".

He was born in Cambridge and died at Pontardawe, Glamorgan, Wales. The nephew of the mid-Victorian cricketer Alfred Diver, Edwin Diver was primarily a right-handed middle-order batsman, though he was also occasionally used as a wicketkeeper and even more occasionally as a right-arm medium-pace bowler, just once to devastating effect. He also played football as a goalkeeper for the Cambridgeshire county side and for Aston Villa. Surrey cricketer Diver qualified to play cricket for Surrey by residence as a schoolmaster at a school in Wimbledon and played for the county for four years from 1883. In the first three seasons, he played as an amateur. Though to modern eyes his figures do not look out-of-the-ordinary, his early career with Surrey was judged as \\"short but brilliant\\" by the editor of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, Sydney Pardon: in the obituary of Diver in the 1925 edition, Pardon wrote that he had been \\"a most attractive batsman in point of style, with splendid hitting power on the off side\\" and that his success had been instant. In 1884, Diver was awarded his county cap by Surrey and was also selected for some of the most significant first-class matches of the season: the games between a \\"Gentlemen of England\\" side and the Australian touring team and the Gentlemen v Players match at The Oval. Pardon remembered the first match between the Gentlemen and the Australians more than 40 years on and reckoned it as \\"perhaps the most memorable in which he [Diver] ever took part\\". He wrote: > The Australians had to follow on, but they set the Gentlemen 128 to get in > the last innings and against Palmer and Giffen, bowling at the top of their > form on a worn pitch, the task proved a formidable one. Indeed, the > Australians looked to be winning when, with six wickets down and 45 still > required, Diver joined A. G. Steel. Rising to the occasion, they hit off the > runs without being separated. One can remember the finish as well as if the > match had been played last season. Except that Diver put one ball up ‚Äì it > dropped out of reach over Boyle's head at short mid-on ‚Äì the batting was > flawless. Diver's scores in the game were only 4 and 22 not out. In the return match, which the Australians won, his scores were 20 and 0. His trio of representative matches that season were completed with failure to score in either innings in the Gentlemen v Players game. For Surrey, Diver's best season was 1885 when he scored 941 runs in first-class matches and made his only century for the team, an innings of 143 against Oxford University. For the 1886 season, however, Diver went on to the Surrey staff as a professional cricketer: he was less successful as a batsman that season, though he did appear for the Players in the Gentlemen v Players fixture, an unusual distinction having played for the Gentlemen in 1884. He scored 25 runs in his only innings, the final day of the match being lost to rain. He did not stay at Surrey after the end of the season however: a note in The Times at the start of the 1887 season reported that he had returned to Cambridge. Warwickshire cricketer Diver disappears from cricket records for the four seasons after he left Surrey in 1886, and there are no records of him in minor cricket either. He reappeared in 1891 playing for clubs in the Birmingham area, including the Warwickshire Club and Ground team; he also signed as a professional footballer for Aston Villa, appearing in three first-team matches in the 1891‚Äì92 season. In both 1891 and 1892, he played in first-class North v South matches, each time acting as wicketkeeper as well as batsman, and in 1893 he was picked for a \\"Second Class Counties\\" eleven which played a first- class match against the Australians. From 1894, Warwickshire's matches against other first-class cricket teams counted as first-class and the county club began assembling a full professional side: Diver was in the side from the beginning and retired from football to become a professional cricketer again. The first Warwickshire first-class game was a match against Nottinghamshire and Diver was prominent in a Warwickshire victory, though not for the expected reasons. In the Nottinghamshire second innings, Diver took six wickets for 58 runs in 30.3 overs: these were the only wickets Diver took in a first-class career that stretched over 19 years, and he bowled more balls in this single innings than he did in any other complete cricket season. The Birmingham Daily Post was particularly enthusiastic about Diver's bowling. It wrote that he had bowled very well \\"and should be most serviceable as a change bowler this season.\\" It continued: \\"His great height gives him every advantage, and the ball delivered right over comes up very fast from the pitch. He bowls well on the offside to his field, and it will surprise us if he does not obtain a good number of wickets in Warwickshire's county matches.\\" Those hopes were not realised, but Diver settled into an eight-year period in which he was a regular No 3 or middle-order batsman with the Warwickshire side, which competed in the County Championship from the 1895 season. He was not always successful: in 1895, he played in only seven matches and averaged only 12 runs an innings, but later in the 1890s he was the county's leading batsman in some seasons. In 1896, he scored 998 runs at an average of 32.19, and the runs included his first Warwickshire century, an unbeaten innings of 112 made in the match against Essex. In this game he also kept wicket in the absence of the regular Warwickshire wicketkeeper, Dick Lilley, on Test match duty; he also on occasion kept wicket while Lilley's sometimes-effective bowling was used. His best season with the bat in terms of aggregate was 1899, when he scored more than 1000 runs in a season for the only time in his career: 1096 at an average of 29.62. This season produced his highest innings, a score of 184 made out of a total of just 276 on the first day of the match against Leicestershire; Diver had made 121 by lunchtime. It also saw a recall to representative cricket, with an appearance for the Players in the Gentlemen v Players match, though he contributed only seven runs to a total of 647, and selection for a Midland Counties XI against the Australians, when he again failed as a batsman. The 1900 season was not successful for Diver. He scored just 421 runs in 19 matches for an average of 16.19, and passed 50 just twice. A report at the start of the 1901 season indicates that Diver appeared for practice with the Warwickshire team, though it also states that the County Club was in severe financial difficulties. In the event, Diver played in only one match, the away fixture with Surrey at The Oval, and that was the last game of his first-class career. Disappearance and reappearance In November 1901, some explanation for Diver's stuttering end to his cricket career emerged in newspaper reports of a court case in Walsall in which the North Worcestershire Brewery Company petitioned the police court to be allowed to transfer the licence of the Priory Hotel, Walsall, from Diver to his wife, Alice, on account of the fact that Diver had disappeared. Mrs Diver is reported to have told the court that her husband left on 12 November and that \\"she had not the slightest idea that he was going away\\". A hotel guest had told her that Diver had been seen at Queenstown taking a ship for New York, but she had not heard from him since his disappearance. The licence was duly transferred temporarily to Mrs Diver, who was reported to have had \\"considerable experience in the trade\\"; the police insisted that Diver should not be allowed to hold the licence if he reappeared, and Mrs Diver said that she \\"would not allow her husband to live at or take part in the management of the house if he came back\\". A report in February 1902 noted that the transfer of the licence had been made permanent and that Diver's whereabouts were \\"still unknown\\". Diver did not stay disappeared for long. He was formally not re-engaged by Warwickshire for the 1902 season but by August a local newspaper in his home town of Cambridge was reporting that he had been expected to turn out for Cambridgeshire in a fixture against the newly reformed Suffolk side, but had not played; he was described as \\"engaged at Hunstanton\\". In 1903, he was a professional at Newport, Monmouthshire and averaged more than 50 runs per innings in topping the averages. He also played in a minor match for a Monmouthshire side, and continued then to play for the county when it joined the Minor Counties in 1905, right through to the First World War outbreak in 1914, acting as a middle-order batsman and frequently as wicketkeeper. He also played in South Wales sides from 1905 to 1907 that played minor matches against the touring teams from Australia, the West Indies and South Africa.

Inspired by the fantastical stories of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, the Haul was designed by Shannon O‚ÄôHare and built by a crew of volunteers at the Shipyard art space in Berkeley, CA, in 2006. Originally intended to be a ‚Äòmutant vehicle‚Äô for the Burning Man art festival in Nevada, the Haul is made from 75% recycled materials, and measures 24 feet long, 24 feet high, and 12 feet wide. It is built on the base of a fifth-wheel trailer, and the second and third story of the structure pack down into the first for highway towing. When fully built and decked out for exhibition at Burning Man, the Haul is able to propel itself at a top speed of 5 miles per hour and requires a crew of ten people to operate safely (since Victorian houses are notoriously lacking in side- and rear-view mirrors). Currently, the Neverwas Haul makes her home at Obtainium Works, an ‚Äúart car factory‚Äù in Vallejo, CA, owned by O‚ÄôHare and home to several other self-styled ‚Äúcontraptionists.‚Äù  Steampunk Fiction and Art  The Haul is often associated with steampunk, a sub-cultural movement that draws its inspiration from a fusion of Victorian-era science fiction and contemporary technology. True to the alternative histories that are a staple of the steampunk genre, the Neverwas Haul has its origin story in a history that never was, a history in which the Hibernian Empire (not the British Empire) dominated the sociopolitical landscape of the nineteenth century‚ÄîHibernia being an obscure name for Ireland. In this mythology, the Neverwas Haul is the greatest of all the Hauls ‚Äì gypsy vardo-like vehicles driven by Track Banshees ‚Äì itinerant women who use their preternatural mechanical skills to keep their families on the move. The Haul is the primary mode of transport for the Traveling Academy of Unnatural Science, who seek to acculturate the heathens of the Black Rock Desert (where the Burning Man festival is held) by sharing such cultural staples as fine whiskey, Gin and Tonics, and high tea.  Accommodations  The Neverwas Haul consists of three major sections: engine room, command deck, and parlor. The engine room stores extra cargo and seats up to six people. The command deck is dominated by a full size ship's wheel for steering. The controls are a throttle for hydraulic control, and a dead man switch for emergency stops. The parlor is well apportioned: it has a bar, library, veranda, vintage stuffed chairs, and a camera obscura. There are even stairs to the \\"widows walk\\" which has a rooftop view. While many media sources cite the Neverwas Haul as an unusual RV or Winnebago, it is primarily a large overly detailed kinetic art piece.  Media Appearances  Outside of Burning Man, the Neverwas Haul is featured in books, TV and several music videos: * 2018‚Äì2019: The Neverwas Haul was on display at the Lyft Art Park in Las Vegas as part of a revolving display of Burning Man Art pieces. * 2013: A feature of the Vintage Tomorrows book and 2016 documentary about the Steampunk movement and its effect on technology. * 2012: One of the featured art pieces in Abney Park's \\"Steampunk Revolution\\" music video. * 2012: Appeared on Oddities: San Francisco TV Show, Season 01, Episode 04, \\"Holy Hydrocephalic Cow.\\" * 2010: Musician Ren√©e de la Prade tours the Neverwas Haul while singing in Culann's Hounds' \\"Land of Lost Things\\" music video.

She finds the community and infiltrates it by pretending to have forgotten her identity. Alice slowly finds acceptance within the commune and learns that each member has suffered a tremendous loss or trauma, and that the group, despite currently living in joy and harmony, eventually intends to commit mass suicide. One of the residents, Charlie, finds Alice's hidden I.D. card but doesn't expose her lie. The two begin a romantic relationship. After realizing how supported she feels by the group, Alice reveals her identity and pleas the others to let her stay, which they allow.

The show was held in memory of wrestling referee Mark Curtis, who died of stomach cancer at his home in Talbott, Tennessee on September 8, 1999, with the proceeds donated to the Children's Miracle Network.Goodman, Larry. \\"5/7 Mark Curtis Memorial show report.\\" DeclarationofIndependents.net. Ed. Sean McCaffrey. N.p., May. 2005. Web. 5 October 2011. . Many of the Curtis Comes Home participants returned to take part in the 2005 edition. Like the original event, the Mark Curtis Memorial Reunion served as an unofficial reunion show for Smokey Mountain Wrestling where Curtis had served as head referee. Johnson City's Freedom Hall was a monthly venue for the promotion during the early 1990s. One commentator wrote that the venue choice, in addition to the \\"small but enthusiastic\\" crowd, gave the event a nostalgic feel of an SMW show. Six professional wrestling matches, two of which were for championships, were featured on the card. The main attraction on the event card was a tag team match for the Tri-Cities Tag Team Championship with Mick Foley and Shane Douglas, accompanied by former trainer Dominic DeNucci, versus Al Snow and D'Lo Brown managed by Les Thatcher. The championship itself was an \\"unsanctioned title\\" with the four men instead battling for the right to call themselves the \\"best friends\\" of the late Mark Curtis. On the undercard, Terry Taylor defeated Tom Prichard in a standard wrestling match for the Texas Heavyweight Championship. The return of Count Grog, coming out of retirement for a special one-night appearance, was also promoted for the card. The show drew only 350 people, a much smaller number compared to the 1,500 fans that had attended Curtis Comes Home five years earlier. In spite of the low attendance, the show's surprise main event was highly praised. Tim Whitehead of PWInsider.com found the show very enjoyable and that \\"everyone involved deserves praise for volunteering their time for this tribute to a great representative of the best side of the wrestling business\\". Declaration of Independents and WrestleView.com echoed these sentiments but were less enthusiastic about many of the undercard matches. Event Prior to the show, wrestling fans had the opportunity to interact with D'Lo Brown, Dominic DeNucci, Shane Douglas, Mick Foley, Tom Prichard, Al Snow and Terry Taylor in a special autograph and photo session. Johnny Grunge, Sandy Scott and Tracy Smothers were among those scheduled to attend but later cancelled. The show was opened by former Smokey Mountain Wrestling ring announcer Tommy Noe who brought out SMW television announcers Chip Kessler and Les Thatcher as part of the announcing team for the event. The three men were subsequently joined by the rest of the roster for a ten-bell salute to the late Chris Candido, one of SMW's top heel performers during the mid-1990s, and a participant of Curtis Comes Home, who had died the previous week. This was followed by local East Tennessee wrestler Mike Cooper who sang the American national anthem to start the event. Preliminary matches The first match on the card was a battle royal. It featured 12 men including stars from Mark Curtis' home state of Pennsylvania, Lord Zoltan and Preston Steele, as well as Southern wrestlers The Ace Crusader, Count Grog, Dirty Dick Flanagan, Tony Givens, Beau James, Dave \\"The Science\\" Pillman, Dave Renegade, Dan Richards, Super Destroyer and The Hillbillies (Bucky and Cletus). Flanagan scored an upset victory by eliminating Steele to win the battle royal. After the opening match ended, Noe introduced Mick Foley who was returning as a special guest referee. The retired wrestler came to the ring and spoke to the crowd about Mark Curtis, describing his refereeing career in Smokey Mountain Wrestling and World Championship Wrestling, and referencing the Curtis Comes Home show held only a few weeks before his death. He also noted the show's surprisingly small crowd and claimed that a rival promoter, later alleged to be Terry Landell, had torn down flyers promoting the charity show which Foley called \\"a new all- time low for pro wrestling\\". Foley ended his tribute by informing the audience that all the performers on the show were working for free and that \\"there aren't many people [he'd] be willing to work free for, but Mark Curtis [was] one of them\\". Foley then told the crowd that he wanted to publicly acknowledge two men who had greatly influenced his wrestling career. Before he could finish, Al Snow and D'Lo Brown came out to accept this honor. Foley, however, told the WWE superstars that he had not been talking about them. Snow was outraged and claimed that he had come up with the idea for \\"Mr. Socko\\". Foley called this \\"the greatest exaggeration in wrestling history\\" to which Snow answered \\"the only exaggeration would be to call [Foley] a professional wrestler and a snappy dresser\\". At this point, Foley revealed the two men as Dominic DeNucci and Shane Douglas; Curtis, Foley and Douglas had all trained under DeNucci during the 1980s. A heated argument between Foley and Snow ensued setting up a tag team match between the four men, with DeNucci and Les Thatcher as the cornermen, for the kayfabe Tri-Cities Tag Team Championship. The next match of the event was between Eddie Golden and K.C. Thunder. Thunder was accompanied by manager Allan Barrie who taunted the largely Southern crowd under his \\"Duke of New York\\" persona. Golden was able to hit Thunder with his frog splash finisher but Barrie pulled referee Ed Foster out of the ring before he could count the pinfall. While Barrie and Foster argued outside the ring, Thunder struck Golden with brass knuckles and pinned Golden when the referee turned around. Initially declared the winner, Foster found the foreign object on Thunder and awarded the match to his opponent via disqualification. Afterwards, Golden confronted Barrie over his outside interference. As Golden prepared to hit him, Barrie pleaded for mercy pointing out that he was wearing glasses. Golden seemingly relented but then took the manager's glasses off, handed them to the referee, and knocked out Barrie in one punch. The third match of the event saw \\"Ruthless\\" Roger Anderson wrestle Timber the Lumberjack. Anderson's opponent was led by Count Grog, his former manager, who interfered in the bout several times. The two men brawled for eight minutes before Timber brandished an axe wrapped in barbed wire. Anderson kicked the axe into Timber's face and covered him for a three-count. Next was a tag team match with Tim Horner and Cody Michaels facing The Turbanators (Jahid and Saheed) of NWA Blue Ridge. The latter team had won the then vacant tag team championship in Grundy, Virginia the previous night, however, the titles were not on the line. Under the direction of their manager Perry James, The Turbanators employed an anti-American gimmick and ring style similar to The Iron Sheik. They double-teamed Horner for much of the match but Michaels was able to score the winning pinfall when James accidentally hit one of the Turbanators with the team's Iranian flag. In the featured match on the undercard, Terry Taylor pinned Dr. Tom Prichard following a forearm smash to win the Texas Heavyweight Championship. Prichard, a notorious \\"heel\\" in SMW as a member of The Heavenly Bodies, had been cheered as a \\"fan favorite\\" by the crowd. Main event The last match of the night was the main event between Mick Foley and Shane Douglas teaming against Al Snow and D'Lo Brown. Dominic DeNucci and Les Thatcher served as the cornermen respectively. It was announced that both teams were wrestling for the \\"Tri-Cities Tag Team Championship\\", a fictional title representing Johnson City, Kingsport and Bristol, Tennessee, but more importantly deciding who were Mark Curtis' best friends. The bout was a mix of wild brawling and comedy wrestling from both sides. Snow performed an exaggerated version of \\"The People's Elbow\\" while Foley responded with an unsuccessful attempt to do \\"The Worm\\". This was continued by Brown, who mimicked many of Hulk Hogan's signature maneuvers before a near pinfall on Douglas, and concluded with Douglas delivering \\"Stone Cold Stunners\\" (and middle fingers) to both his opponents. At one point in the match, it appeared Snow had legitimately broken his elbow after Foley tossed him out of the ring with a lariat clothesline. The match was temporarily stopped and Foley jumped out of the ring to check on his opponent. Snow revealed he was feigning his injury and rammed Foley's head into the ring post. Foley's team won the match with a double pinfall; Douglas pinned Brown with a belly-to-belly suplex and Foley pinned Snow using Mr. Socko. DeNucci and Thatcher entered the ring in the final moments of the bout and saw the 75-year-old DeNucci score a pinfall as well. Snow blamed his tag team partner for the loss and, as the two began arguing, someone from the front row threw an object into the ring which he used to knock out Brown. The weapon was revealed to be \\"Head\\", an actual mannequin's head Snow had been using in World Wrestling Entertainment. The night concluded with Snow taking the house microphone and telling the audience that Curtis' friends were not only the wrestlers who participated but the fans in attendance. Foley, whose team had \\"won\\" the right to call themselves Curtis' \\"best friends\\", had the last word however. After Snow had returned to the locker room, Foley told the audience \\"yeah...we're all his friends, but I think [Mark Curtis] liked me and Shane a little bit better!\\" Results References External links Mark Curtis Memorial Reunion at Cagematch.net *Mark Curtis Memorial Reunion at Wrestlingdata.com Professional wrestling memorial shows 2005 in Tennessee Johnson City, Tennessee Professional wrestling in Tennessee May 2005 events in the United States 2005 in professional wrestling Events in Tennessee ","title":"Mark Curtis Memorial Reunion"},{"id":"47088395","text":"Dick Boer (born 31 August 1957) is a Dutch businessman.

Zajca Rijeka), commonly referred to as HNK Zajc, is a theatre, opera and ballet house located in Rijeka. Overview The theater tradition in Rijeka is longer than two centuries. The first theater building in this city was erected in 1765, but at the end of the 18th century the construction of the new theater began, which opened in 1805 by renowned Rijeka citizen and trader Andrea Lodovico Adamich. Over the next 80 years the theater life in Rijeka took place in Theater Adamich, filled mostly by performances of Italian and less by German opera and drama groups. However, in the late 19th century several European theaters struck a fire, and in all the cities of the Habsburg Monarchy began to take safety precautions, and Adamich Theatre did not meet the necessary conditions for normal operation. Rijeka municipal dealership decided to demolish the existing theater and build a brand new, modern and contemporary theater to suit Central European standards. In 1883 Rijeka city government, led by the famous mayor Giovanni Ciotti, the grandson of another legendary Lodovico Adamich, decided to raise a grand new theater building of Rijeka. It was decided that the theater will be built on what was then a vast √úrmeny square. The project was commissioned in Vienna, in a specialized studio for theater, with architects Herman Helmer and Ferdinand Fellner. After two years of construction, the opening day of the new Municipal Theatre (Teatro Comunale) was on October 3, 1885. For this occasion, two great operas never before performed were prepared. They were Verdi's Aida and Ponchielli's Gioconda. On that day, the first visitors, numerous guests and invitees could enjoy the impressive theater building, a masterpiece of architecture of his time, whose figural plastic and ornamental work contributed by the famous Venetian sculptor August Benvenuti and ceiling paintings painter Franz Matsch in cooperation with even more famous brothers, Ernst and Gustav Klimt. In its rich history theater in Rijeka changed its name several times. After the Municipal (Teatro Comunale), the Theatre was renamed, in 1913, to Teatro Verdi. However, due to historical and political circumstances (the city of Rijeka, at the time known as Fiume, became a Free State before passing to the Kingdom of Italy in 1924) the Croatian language and Croatian theater artists did not have access to the theater at all until the end of 1945 when, following the example of similar permanent national domestic and foreign theatrical institutions established permanent National Theatre in Rijeka, the Croatian drama, Italian drama and opera and ballet. On October 20, 1946, after passing to Yugoslavia, a show played on its stage in the Croatian language for the first time. It was Ivan Gunduliƒá's Dubravka, directed by Dr. Matko Foteza with Marija Crnobori in the role of Dubravka. It was soon followed by the first performance of an opera and ballet, Zajc's Nikola Subic Zrinjski, conducted by Boris Papandopulo, and the title role sung Milan Pichler. The first play of the Italian drama was Goldoni's Il burbero benefico. In the year 1953 the theater gets a new name after another one composer, but this time the biggest Croatian and a fellow citizen of Rijeka, Ivan Zajc. Since 1991 theater got the status of national theater, and in 1994 its present name, Croatian National Theatre Ivan pl. Zajc. From the historical 1946 to today, with its four artistic branches (Croatian Drama, Italian Drama, the Symphonic Opera and ballet) and more than 50 years of their continuous operation, with its quality performance HNK in Rijeka managed to set high theatrical and artistic criteria and placed itself on the rightful place of one of the by quality leading theaters in Croatia. At the same time, his repertoire today is characterized by performances of drama, opera and ballet classics as well as works of Croatian dramatic and operatic heritage and also first performances of the national acts, especially contemporary. All the major Croatian theaters were built in the second half of the 19th century, including the one in Rijeka - behind Osijek (1865), and before Split (1893) and Zagreb (1895). On 20 March, due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the Croatian National Theatre Ivan pl. Zajc in Rijeka started with an online virtual program Zajc With You on their YouTube channel, as an act responsibility and in solidarity with its audience, citizens of Rijeka and the wider community, especially those most vulnerable ones, either because of their age or because they are \\"on the front line of defense against the virus\\". Some ensembles will not continue their regular and usual work, because it involves gathering of more people, such as orchestras or choirs, and physical contact, such as ballet ensembles. The daily program has the following content and layout: *08:00 AM - Morning selfie poetry - one actor of Croatian or Italian drama reads poetry. *12:00 PM - Aria at noon - a soloist of the opera ensemble performs one aria. *08:00 PM - \\"Zajƒçiƒá\\"(\\"Bunny\\") for a good night - Actors of Croatian and Italian Drama tell children a good night's story. *10:00 PM - Ballet insomnia - a short dance video: ballet practice, solos, choreographic fragments (at a safe distance).

After his defeat in 2008, Hamidi started a campaign to challenge the SEIU 1000's annual financial audits.

Een historische schets van twee bijzondere vrouwenverenigingen in Den Haag. Den Haag, Tesselschade-Arbeid Adelt, 2004. Founded in 1871 under the name Algemeene Vrouwenvereeniging Arbeid Adelt, it was the first nationwide women's organisation in the Netherlands, and the eldest still operating. It split in to the Arbeid Adelt (AA) and Tesselschade in 1872, but reunified in to the Tesselschade-Arbeid Adelt in 1947. History Origin In 1870 women had started to craft and sell products for the Red Cross. Betsy Perk saw this as an opportunity to encourage more women to sell their work. Arbeid Adelt It was founded in 1871 by Betsy Perk under the name Algemeene Vrouwenvereeniging Arbeid Adelt, commonly known as Arbeid Adelt (AA; English: Labour Is Ennobling).Bonnie G. Smith: The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History: 4 Volume Set It was inspired by the debate over women's access to education and different professions, which had been initiated in the Netherlands by Mienette Storm-van der Chijs in the 1860s. The purpose of the organisation was to work for more access to education and professions for women, and to actively support women to support themselves professionally. In October 1871 she founded the 'Algemeen Nederlandsche Vrouwenvereeniging Arbeid Adelt' (General Dutch Women's Association Arbeid Adelt) along with its own magazine, Onze Roeping (Our Calling). The association mostly focused their efforts on unmarried women from the higher classes. In December 1871, an exhibition was organised in Delft where women's crafts could be bought. The names of the makers were presented along the items, which was a new phenomenon and was meant to highlight the fact that these women were craftsmen willing to make profit, too. The exhibition became successful and was even visited by the Dutch Queen Sophie of W√ºrttemberg, who became a patron of the association. Tesselschade In April 1872, the organisation split, and Anna Wolterbeek, Jeltje de Bosch Kemper and Louise Wijnaendt formed their own group, named Tesselschade after Maria Tesselschade Visscher. In April 1872 a fight between board members caused a split within the association. Part of the members decided to found the 'Vereniging Tesselschade', named after Maria Tesselschade Roemers Visscher. This organisation wished to focus more on the support of less-well-off women, who were allowed to sell their works anonymously. This was contrary to what Betsy Perk stood for, as she wanted wealthier women to make a name for themselves by selling products under their own name. The Tesselschade organized the famous Nationale Tentoonstelling van Vrouwenarbeid 1898. Tesselschade-Arbeid Adelt Both associations decided to join forces again in 1947, after a successful exhibition on needlework. Due to discussions about organisational issues the groups didn't actually fuse until 1953. From then on, the association became known as Tesselschade-Arbeid Adelt, and still exists today. TAA, among other things, has several shops throughout the Netherlands where women can sell their articles. The association also has two funds, one for female students (the Betsy Perk-Opleidingsfonds) and one for (retired) craftswomen who can't support themselves anymore (the Zegers Veeckenfonds).

Phylogenetically, the HERV-K group belongs to the ERV2 or Class II or Betaretrovirus-like supergroup. Over the past several years, it has been found that this group of ERVs play an important role in embryogenesis, but their expression is silenced in most cell types in healthy adults. The HERV-K family, and particularly its subgroup HML-2, is the youngest and most transcriptionally active group and hence, it is the best studied among other ERVs. Reactivation of it or anomalous expression of HML-2 in adult tissues has been associated with various types of cancer and with neurodegenerative diseases such as amytrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) is related to mammary tumor virus in mice. It exists in the human and cercopithecoid genomes. Human genome contains hundreds of copies of HERV-K and many of them possess complete open reading frames (ORFs) that are transcribed and translated, especially in early embryogenesis and in malignancies. HERV-K is also found in apes and Old World monkeys. It is uncertain how long ago in primate evolution the full-length HERV-K proviruses which are in the human genome today were created. M.

In 1999 Barbulescu, et al. showed that, of ten HERV-K proviruses cloned, eight were unique to humans, while one was shared with chimpanzees and bonobos, and one with chimpanzees, bonobos and gorillas. Originally, HERV-K was observed by low-stringency hybridization with probes for the mammary tumor virus of the mouse and A particle intracutaneous mouse. In 2015 Grow et al. demonstrated that HERV-K is transcribed during embryogenesis from the eight cell stage up to the stem cell derivation. Furthermore, overexpression of the HERV-K accessory protein Rec (regulator of expression encoded by corf; ) increases IFITM1 levels on the cell surface and inhibits viral infection. HERV-K is called, phylogenetically, a supergroup of viruses. It is the only group that reported to contain human-specific members of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). M. Garcia-Montojo, T.

It is the third novel in his series of a crime solver and sports agent named Myron Bolitar. Plot summary Fade Away is a novel featuring Myron Bolitar, a sports agent, hired by the New Jersey Dragons to find a missing basketball star. Myron and his team of associates, work together to puzzle out the disappearance of Greg Downing, drawing Myron into danger, both physical and emotional. Myron Bolitar is a sports agent and sometimes investigator, called by Clip Arnstein, the owner of the New Jersey Dragons. Clip's star player is missing and he wants Myron to find him. Greg Downing had been Myron's rival throughout their youth and college days. Both had been drafted to play professional basketball, but Greg is the only one that made it. Myron's knee had been injured in what was believed to be a freak accident on the court, and he had never played professionally. Clip wants Myron to take Greg's place on the team, feeling that the other players would be more open with him rather than an investigator. Myron is reluctant yet excited at the same time. Having never had the opportunity to play pro-ball, he is anxious to know if he can make it with the Dragons. Myron investigates Greg's disappearance with the help of his closest friend, Win. The two men discover a mysterious woman had left a message on Greg's answering machine to arrange a meeting the night he vanished. Following leads, Myron discovers the woman has been murdered, and Greg is the main suspect. Initially believing that Greg had a drug problem, Myron discovers that the woman had in fact been blackmailing Greg, though he does not know why. Greg also has a large gambling problem, and Myron thinks that may be what the blackmail involves. Further investigation reveals that the mysterious woman is in fact a fugitive. A member of the Sixties radical group The Raven Brigade, Liz Gorman had contacted Greg after the group had robbed a bank in Arizona several months previously. The investigation takes several twists and turns, involving custody battles between Greg and his wife Emily, a former girlfriend of Myron's, and the assistance of Audrey Wilson, the sports reporter that covers the New Jersey Dragons. Audrey uncovers the real reason that Myron is on the team, and convinces him that the two of them can work together to find Greg. In exchange for sharing information, Audrey agrees not to release the story about Greg disappearing. Audrey discovers that Greg had hired a private investigator to follow Emily. Myron uncovers a video tape of Emily and Maggie Mason, a woman known as Thumper, having sex. Mason has close ties to the team. Myron believes Emily had been set up and can understand her extreme anger at Greg. The murder weapon is discovered in Greg's house, and other evidence that had been in the house vanishes. It is clear that someone is trying to frame Greg for murder, while another person may be trying to protect him. In another development, the blackmailers contact Myron and offer to sell him the information they had offered Greg. Events come to a head when Myron meets up with the leader of the Raven Brigade, Cole Whiteman. He admits that he and Liz Gorman had indeed been blackmailing Greg, but will not reveal with what. Leaving him, Myron meets up with Audrey, and receives a phone call from the blackmailer. The two travel to a remote location and meet with a man in a ski mask. Audrey shoots the man, claiming he was going to kill Myron. Myron confronts her. Audrey had killed Gorman to protect Greg and their unborn child. It had been Audrey that cleaned up the evidence at Greg's house, leaving the murder weapon planted by Emily, as it had not been discovered. The blackmailer at the scene was in fact a homicide detective, part of the set up to catch Audrey. Myron returns to the Arena to confront Clip Arnstein and is handed an audio cassette. On the tape is evidence that Myron's injury so many years ago was not an accident after all. Greg had paid another player to hurt Myron. Though he had not intended for the injury to be career ending, Greg was angry at Myron for having a one-night stand with Emily the night before their wedding. Arnstein had known about the tape from the beginning and could think of no other way to tell Myron. Arnstein wanted Myron to have closure. Myron realizes that though his basketball career was ended, he had created a life for himself, a good life with friends and people that love him. Despite his loss of a career in basketball, he had moved on, becoming successful. Myron still mourned for the chances that he had missed in life, but cherished the chances he had been given.  Major Themes   Friendship  Friendship is a strong theme in the novel. The deep friendship of Myron and Windsor Horne Lockwood III is clearly evident. Myron can depend on Win, no questions asked. The two had met in college, and no matter which directions their lives turn, the friendship remains. Myron is also close friends with Esperanza Diaz, his assistant at MB SportsReps. Myron and Esperanza understand each other in the way that brothers and sisters do. Win and Esperanza both know and understand Myron well, sometimes better than he understands himself. When Myron is given the chance to play professional basketball again, both refuse to attend the games, unwilling to see Myron suffer the loss of the game again. Esperanza feels that Myron will give himself to the game completely, and the loss will crush him. Win has always felt that Myron's injury was intentional, and had never followed up at Myron's request. Still, the thought of seeing Myron on the court would be too much of a reminder for Win to bear. Myron's friendship with Win and Esperanza is enduring and trusting. The three are free to express themselves honestly, without worry of offending each other or losing the true friendship that they share.  Deception  The central plot of Fade Away, is the blackmail of Greg Downing. The blackmailers themselves practice deception, by trying to blackmail many people with the same information. Greg Downing had paid for someone to injure Myron, and the Raven Brigade had discovered this information when they had robbed a bank in Arizona. Clip Arnstein also practices deception when he hires Myron to find Greg. Though Clip is aware of the blackmail, and the proof that Myron's injury was intentional, he does not reveal this to Myron at the outset. Clip is unsure of how to tell Myron the truth, so he orchestrates Myron's discovery of the tape revealing the original plot by Greg. Audrey Wilson's deception is the most dramatic. Though she tells Myron that she is working with him to locate Greg simply as a guarantee to be first with the story, in reality she is also looking for Greg. The blackmail scheme had driven Greg into hiding, and Audrey, in order to protect her husband and unborn child had killed the blackmailer, Liz Gorman. By working with Myron to find Greg, Audrey is also keeping track of the investigation, covering her tracks and protecting Greg when he becomes the prime suspect  Loyalty  Many characters exhibit loyalty throughout the novel. Myron's friends, Esperanza and Win are extremely loyal to him. Though Esperanza shrouds her caring in sarcasm and humor, she is a bit like a guard dog, always watching to make sure Myron is safe. Esperanza deeply dislikes Myron's girlfriend Jessica, because Jessica had left him and broke his heart years before. Even though Jessica has returned and Myron seems to be happy, Esperanza still refers to her as 'the bitch.' Myron does not like the name, but accepts that Esperanza loves him and still hurts for the times that he had suffered. The fact that Esperanza and Win will not attend any of the games Myron plays in also demonstrates loyalty. They are aware that he had been devastated when he was injured and forced to give up the game he loves. Myron is deeply loyal to his girlfriend Jessica. Though Jessica had left him a few years earlier, they had gotten back together. Myron believes in the love they have for each other, even though Esperanza has made it clear that she does not like of trust Jessica, Myron exhibits his loyalty to Esperanza, by allowing her to feel the way that she does, without getting angry at her outbursts. Perhaps the oddest loyalty throughout Fade Away, is Myron's loyalty to Greg. Myron feels a bond with Greg due to the competitive nature of their relationship in their youth and college years. Because of this loyalty, Myron works throughout the novel to find Greg, as well as prove his innocence in the murder of Liz Gorman. This loyalty is misplaced, as Greg is the person who had caused Myron's injury ten years ago, ending his career in professional basketball.  Setting  The novel takes place in many different locations in the New York metropolitan area. The Continental Arena, home of the New Jersey Dragons is located in New Jersey, as is the main character, Myron Bolitar's hometown of Livingston. Myron's office is located in the same building as Locke-Horn Securities in Manhattan. A central location in the novel is the Meadowlands Arena, the home of the New Jersey Dragons, where Myron plays professional basketball for the first time. Much of the novel takes place within the city of New York as well as Greenwich Village. The storyline follows Myron Bolitar as he searches for Greg Downing. Myron travels throughout different areas of the city the outlying suburbs in his search for Greg, as well as trying to find the truth behind the murder of Liz Gorman.  Style   Point of View  The novel is written in the third person, omniscient. For the most part, Myron Bolitar is the main focus, however there are brief passages where his assistant Esperanza is highlighted. Myron, as the main character, is the center of the majority of the novel, however Esperanza is highlighted in order to bring important facts to the readers attention.  Characters   Myron Bolitar  Myron Bolitar is a 32-year-old sports agent and owner of MB SportsReps. Myron lives in his parents basement, but spends most nights at the apartment of his girlfriend Jessica. A former basketball player, Myron was destined to be a star with the Celtics when a career ending injury forced him to give up the game he loved. Myron moved on with his life, getting his law degree and starting the agency, but never lost his love for the game or his desire to play. Myron gets drawn back into the game of basketball when he agrees to help Clip Arnstein find Greg Downing, one of the stars of the New Jersey Dragons. Playing professional basketball is both a thrill for Myron, and difficult at the same time. As much as Myron loves the game, he comes to realize that he does not have what it takes to play pro ball. Following leads into Greg's disappearance, Myron discovers that Greg is being blackmailed. Though at first Myron believes that the blackmail scheme involves Greg's gambling problem, it is revealed that the information the blackmailers possess is much more personal. Ten years earlier, Myron had been injured in what he believed to be a freak accident on the court. In truth, the injury had been set up by Greg Downing in retaliation for Myron having sex with Greg's wife the day before their wedding.  Windsor Horne Lockwood III  Windsor Horne Lockwood III is Myron's best friend. President of the investment firm Locke-Horn Securities, Win is somewhat of an enigma. Wealthy and intelligent, he looks the part of the aristocratic blue blood, however, he is also a loner, letting very few people into his inner circle of friends. Win is very loyal to those whom he considers his friends, Myron being the closest friend he has. The two men had been roommates in college, and have been best friend ever since. Myron runs his sports agency, and Win runs the family firm, and both have been known to work for the FBI undercover. Win stays to himself for the most part and has no close relationships other than Myron. Raised in a world of power and prestige, Win seems not to have developed the personality to become close to people, preferring his lifestyle of one-night stands with no strings attached. Win readily admits to Myron that he is not the person with whom to discuss personal relationships, as he does not have any way to guide himself, let alone anyone else. Myron and Win seem to balance each other. Both are intelligent and care for other people. However, Myron has a conscience, and Win does not appear to have one.  Esperanza Diaz  Myron's right hand 'man' at MB SportsReps, Esperanza is the former star of the Fabulous Ladies of Wrestling, or FLOW. Spotted by a modeling agent at the age of seventeen, Esperanza had finally made a name for herself as Little Pocahontas. Now, working with Myron, Esperanza also attends night school, working toward her law degree. Esperanza and Myron share what seems to be a brother and sister type of relationship. Esperanza holds nothing back with Myron, expressing her opinions freely, with no thought that Myron will be angry. Esperanza is very clear about her feelings toward Myron's girlfriend Jessica, calling her 'the bitch.' Esperanza has never forgiven Jessica for leaving Myron and breaking his heart many years ago. Myron understands this, and though he asks her not to call Jessica names, realizes that Esperanza cares for him deeply. Esperanza is a key character in the novel Fade Away, as it is she that discovers the reason the blackmailers have contacted Greg. Esperanza also shows her depth of caring for Myron when she contact Win immediately in order to protect Myron from discovering what is on the blackmailer's tape.  Jessica  Jessica is Myron's girlfriend and a writer. Myron and Jessica began dating right before Myron was injured ten years ago, forcing him to give up his dream of professional basketball. Though they had broken up previously, they are back together, and though Myron technically still lived in his parents basement, the majority of the time he spent the night at her apartment. Jessica is one of the few people who does not question Myron's taking Greg's place on the Dragons. Though everyone else that knows Myron is worried that he will be hurt when his chance is over, Jessica feels that Myron needs to play, even if only to prove to himself that he can not play the way he used to. It is Jessica's feeling that when Myron was injured he turned to her, crushing their relationship under the weight of his needs.  Greg Downing  A star player on the New Jersey Dragons, Greg disappears, causing Clip Arnstein to hire Myron to find him. Greg has been known to run away from problems before, and as he is in the middle of an ugly custody battle with his ex-wife Emily, the team owner thinks that things may have gotten to be too much for Greg. Myron is hired to find him. Myron feels a bond with Greg, as they had been competitors in their youth and though college. Myron believes that the bond they share had made them both better players. Myron had been injured before his chance to play for the Celtics, but Greg had gone on to become a major star. In his search for Greg, Myron uncovers a blackmail scheme and murder, making Greg the main suspect of the police. Myron proves his innocence in the murder, but discovers that his knee injury was not a freak accident as he had thought for the past ten years, but had been orchestrated by Greg in retaliation for Myron sleeping with Emily the night before their wedding.  Audrey Wilson  Audrey Wilson is the sports writer assigned to the New Jersey Dragons. Audrey seems to catch on to the reason that Myron is actually on the team and convinces him that they should work together to solve the mystery of Greg's disappearance. In exchange for not releasing the information to the public, Myron agrees to share whatever he finds with her. Audrey agrees to use her contacts to find out what she can about Greg's personal life. Audrey is actually using Myron in order to find Greg, her secret lover. Audrey had killed Liz Gorman, the blackmailer, in order to protect Greg and the future of her unborn child.

The Vereeniging voor Vrouwenkiesrecht (Association for Women's Suffrage) was a women's rights organization active in the Netherlands from 1894 to 1919. It was devoted to women's suffrage. It was the main women's suffrage movement in the Netherlands. The Vereeniging changed its name in 1919 and would fuse with another association in 1930 and again in 1949 and still exists today. The Vereeniging had an audience with the Dutch Queen Wilhelmina and wrote letters to members of the Dutch parliament. In 1907 some members of the Vereeniging founded their own association, the Nederlandsche Bond voor Vrouwenkiesrecht (Dutch League for Women's Suffrage), which was more moderate. This was partly done out of disapproval for the more extreme measures English suffragettes used, measures that weren't used by the Vereeniging but weren't condemned by them either. The two associations would fuse together again in 1930. After women's suffrage was achieved in 1919, the Vereeniging changed its name to the Vereniging van Staatsburgeressen (Association of Citizenesses) and kept striving for women to be independent, although the woman's role within the family was still important for the association. The Vereeniging also wrote to organisations to ask for women in high functions. In 1930 the association fused with the Nederlandsche Unie voor Vrouwenbelangen (Dutch Union for Women's Interests) and became the Nederlandse Vereniging voor Vrouwenbelangen en Gelijk Staatsburgerschap (Dutch Association for Women's Interests and Equal Citizenship) and in 1949 it fused with the Nationale Vereniging voor Vrouwenarbeid (National Association for Women's Labour) and became the Nederlandse Vereniging voor Vrouwenbelangen, Vrouwenarbeid en Gelijk Staatsburgerschap (Dutch Association for Women's Interests, Women's Labour and Equal Citizenship). This fusion still exists today. The association published a monthly magazine called Maandblad van de Vereeniging voor Vrouwenkiesrecht, after 1919 called Maandblad van de Nederlandsche Vereeniging van Staatsburgeressen and after 1930 called Maandblad van de Nederlandsche Vereeniging voor Vrouwenbelangen en Gelijk Staatsburgerschap. Chairmembers The association had a head management consisting of 9, 11 or 13 members and a daily management consisting of a president, vice president, secretary and a treasurer, who met in person seldomly, but usually conversed in writing. Men were allowed in the head management, but not in the daily management. Two presidents of the Vereeniging were: * 1894‚Äì1902: Annette Versluys-Poelman * 1903‚Äì1919: Aletta Jacobs Other board members were, amongst others, Wilhelmina Drucker and Mien van Itallie-van Embden.

Unlike the Old Town and the New Town, the area was rebuilt after World War II and includes some of the city's best known historical monuments, including the St. Mary's basilica, Golden Gate, Artus Court, Main City Hall, the Royal Road, Long Lane and Long Market. The Main City is located on the western bank of Mot≈Çawa. It is surrounded by the Old Town to the north, the Stare Przedmie≈õcie to the south, the borough of Nowe Ogrody to the east and the Granary Island to the east, across Mot≈Çawa. It was founded in 1343 by the Teutonic Knights who had conquered the area in 1308. Officially a separate settlement from the nearby city (since then called the Old Town), it was chartered with Kulm Law, and was governed separately until 1457, when king Casimir IV of Poland granted the town with the Great Privilege, uniting the Main City with the Old Town and the suburb of Osiek. From then onwards the Main City shared its history with the rest of Gda≈Ñsk. In 19th century many houses in the largely mediaeval and renaissance part of Gda≈Ñsk received new, Gothic revival fa√ßades in line with a trend in Germany tying this style to \\"German spirit\\". During World War II the Main City was often targeted by Allied bombing raids. It received further damage during and immediately after the Siege of Danzig in the spring of 1945. Altogether, approximately 90% of all buildings in the Main City were destroyed. Despite serious opposition to the idea, in 1949 Polish authorities decided to rebuild the Main City, with most of its historical landmarks. However, instead of reconstructing the city to the way it looked immediately before World War II, various landmarks were restored to historical and quasi- historical forms alluding to their renaissance look, in order to underline the city's ties with Poland, but also to emphasize Gda≈Ñsk's rich multi-cultural tradition, with Flemish, Italian and French influences. In addition, Polish architects got rid of the largely mediaeval dense urban fabric and reconstructed mostly the fa√ßades along the main streets, while annexes, second and third rows of houses with their courtyards were replaced by larger open spaces, in line with contemporary understanding of urban planning.

She worked for the New York Public Library from 1960 until 1985, spearheading the South Bronx Project, an effort to revitalize communities in the Bronx through library workshops and outreach, and also advocating for library services for under served communities, especially speakers of languages other than English. Early life and education L√≥pez was born in Salinas, Puerto Rico in 1925, and spent her childhood in the nearby town of Ponce. in 1935, at the age of 10, she, her younger sister and her mother moved to New York City, where they were reunited with Lillian's older sister, Evalina. L√≥pez graduated from Washington Irving High School in 1944 and enrolled at Hunter College in 1952, earning a B.A. degree in 1959. She enrolled in the Columbia University Library Science program in 1960, and worked as a library trainee with the New York Public Library while she earned her MLS degree. New York Public Library L√≥pez spent her entire career as a librarian working for the New York Public Library system, retiring in 1985 after 25 years of service. She was involved in libraries in Manhattan and in the Bronx, and advocated particularly to increase library services for Spanish-speaking communities. She worked closely with Pura Belpr√©, the first Puerto Rican librarian in the NYPL system, and a children's author and puppeteer. In 1967, she helped to found the South Bronx Project, an outreach program by the NYPL to increase community services for patrons in the borough, with a special emphasis on black, immigrant and other under served populations. The project secured over $200,000 in funding in its first year from the Library Services and Construction Act. In 1972, she became the coordinator of the Special Services Office with the NYPL, a system-wide position that allowed her to implement projects similar to the South Bronx Project in other New York City neighborhoods. In 1979, she became the Bronx Borough Coordinator, a position she held until her retirement in 1985. Labor and education advocacy Throughout her career, L√≥pez was involved with labor advocacy programs, particularly labor rights for women of color. Her elder sister Evalina Antonetty was the founder of the United Bronx Parents, an advocacy and community outreach program that focuses on educational and social services for African-American and Latino students in the Bronx. Like her sister, L√≥pez was also dedicated to creating and providing access to educational resources for Spanish-speakers and other minority groups. Retirement and death L√≥pez retired from her position at the New York Public Library in 1985, after working there for 25 years, and died in 2005 at the age of 80.

History Roving reference as a library service practice was first formalized in the late 1980s and early 1990s. A 1999 report from the International Federation of Library Associations identified several advantages and disadvantages with roving reference in the pre-mobile era. The roving model allowed librarians to engage with \\"the majority of users who have questions in mind [who] do not approach the reference desk for assistance\\". However, libraries reported that some staff were uncomfortable with the practice, and that there were concerns about user privacy. Beginning in the 2000s, librarians used laptops or laptop carts to engage in technology-supported roaming reference. Since the development of mobile technologies, roving reference can be facilitated with the use of such technologies, such as tablet computers, which allow librarians to readily check the online public access catalogue or the library's electronic databases while away from their desk.Smith, Annie; Stevens, Mark (2012). \\"We're Going Mobile: Roving Reference in an Academic Library\\" Utah Library Association.

Early life Born in Calabar, Nigeria, Umotong alongside her family moved to Birmingham, England when she was one year old. She is the youngest of six siblings born to Dr Ben Anefiok and Grace Umotong of Ikono in Akwa Ibom State. She began playing football at the age of five and it was in Primary school where she was spotted by Birmingham City in 2003. She later went to King Edward VI Five Ways School. International career She earned her first call up to the Super Falcons in February, 2015 when coach Edwin Okon invited 36 players to camp to prepare for the 11th All- Africa Games qualifiers, 2016 Olympic Games qualifiers and the 7th FIFA Women‚Äôs World Cup finals. The Economics and Actuarial Science undergraduate at the University of Southampton had to skip the first two weeks of the camp in Abuja due to her studies. On arrival after two weeks, promising Umotong got her first taste of action almost immediately as a late substitute in a warm-up 1‚Äì1 draw against a male academy team, showing true dedication in her quest to make the team for Canada 2015. She followed it up with a goal when she came on for 20 minutes in another tune-up match against Nigeria Women Premier League side, Confluence Queens, before becoming the first Portsmouth player to feature in a full international after making her 33-minute debut for Nigeria in the first leg of their All-Africa Games qualifier against Mali in Bamako. She was eventually named in the 23-player list for the World Cup in Canada but did not feature in any of Nigeria's three group matches as the African Champions failed to progress to the knockout stage. In January 2019 at the Four Nations Tournament in China, Umotong scored her first goal for the Super Falcons. She emerged from the substitute's bench to register the final goal in a 4‚Äì1 win over Romania. \\"One of the stand-out moments of my career,\\" she said. Club career Umotong's phenomenal first season (2014‚Äì15) at Portsmouth has opened the path for her international career, after her goal scoring exploits led the FA Women's Premier League Southern Division side to win their seventh successive Hampshire County Cup and the league title, while narrowly missing out on promotion to the FA Women's Super League 2. With 29 goals in 25 league and cup matches, Umotong emerged top goal scorer for Pompey. Brighton & Hove Albion against Manchester United in February 2019 In February 2016, Umotong left Portsmouth for FA WSL 2 club Oxford United. Oxford manager Les Taylor was pleased with the signing: \\"Ini is a striker who possesses both power and pace.\\" She had scored 25 goals for Portsmouth during the first part of 2015‚Äì16. With Oxford Umotong continued to score regularly, finishing FA WSL 2 top-goalscorer with 13 goals in 19 appearances, before adding four goals in seven appearances in the FA WSL Spring Series. After a transfer to Brighton & Hove Albion in July 2017, Umotong scored eight league goals to help the Seagulls finish second in the re-branded second tier (now known as the FA Women's Championship). When Brighton successfully bid for a franchise in the top division, Umotong was one of the club's existing players to be kept on. She hailed the influence of Brighton coach Hope Powell, crediting the former England manager with a dramatic improvement in her game. Personal life Before becoming a full-time footballer with Brighton, Umotong combined her football career with her studies for an Economics degree at the University of Southampton. She graduated with first-class honours and claimed to have been inspired by Eniola Aluko.

A regular embedding of codimension one is precisely an effective Cartier divisor.  Examples and usage  For example, if X and Y are smooth over a scheme S and if i is an S-morphism, then i is a regular embedding. In particular, every section of a smooth morphism is a regular embedding. If operatorname{Spec}B is regularly embedded into a regular scheme, then B is a complete intersection ring. The notion is used, for instance, in an essential way in Fulton's approach to intersection theory. The important fact is that when i is a regular embedding, if I is the ideal sheaf of X in Y, then the normal sheaf, the dual of I/I^2, is locally free (thus a vector bundle) and the natural map operatorname{Sym}(I/I^2) to oplus_0^infty I^n/I^{n+1} is an isomorphism: the normal cone operatorname{Spec}(oplus_0^infty I^n/I^{n+1}) coincides with the normal bundle. A morphism of finite type f:X to Y is called a (local) complete intersection morphism if each point x in X has an open affine neighborhood U so that f U factors as U overset{j}to V overset{g}to Y where j is a regular embedding and g is smooth. For example, if f is a morphism between smooth varieties, then f factors as X to X times Y to Y where the first map is the graph morphism and so is a complete intersection morphism.  Non Examples  One non-example is a scheme which isn't equidimensional. For example, the scheme : X = text{Spec}left( frac{mathbb{C}[x,y,z]}{(xz,yz)}right) is the union of mathbb{A}^2 and mathbb{A}^1. Then, the embedding X hookrightarrow mathbb{A}^3 isn't regular since taking any non-origin point on the z-axis is of dimension 1 while any non-origin point on the xy-plane is of dimension 2.  Virtual tangent bundle  Let f: X to Y be a local-complete-intersection morphism that admits a global factorization: it is a composition X overset{i}hookrightarrow P overset{p}to Y where i is a regular embedding and p a smooth morphism. Then the virtual tangent bundle is an element of the Grothendieck group of vector bundles on X given as: :T_f = [i^* T_{P/Y}] - [N_{X/P}]. The notion is used for instance in the Riemann‚ÄìRoch-type theorem.  Non-noetherian case  SGA 6 Expo VII uses the following weakened form of the notion of a regular embedding, that agrees with the usual one for Noetherian schemes. First, given a projective module E over a commutative ring A, an A-linear map u: E to A is called Koszul-regular if the Koszul complex determined by it is acyclic in dimension > 0 (consequently, it is a resolution of the cokernel of u). NB: We follow the terminology of the Stacks project. Then a closed immersion X hookrightarrow Y is called Koszul-regular if the ideal sheaf determined by it is such that, locally, there are a finite free A-module E and a Koszul-regular surjection from E to the ideal sheaf. (This complication is because the discussion of a zero-divisor is tricky for Non-noetherian rings in that one cannot use the theory of associated primes.)

Abramson at the University of Richmond and Van Veen at Wake Forest. They began by posting silly photos of themselves as well as jokes, links, and other amusing material they collected from emails circulating among college students. Within three months the site was receiving over 600,000 visitors per month and $8,000 in monthly revenue. In under a year they received a buyout offer from an Internet company called eFront for $9 million, most of which would have been financed with stock shares. Abramson and Van Veen refused the offer and continued to grow the company themselves. In 2001 they added Jakob Lodwick, a student at Rochester Institute of Technology, and Zach Klein, a friend of Van Veen's from Wake Forest.‚ÄúBusiness at Collegehumor.com Is No Joke,‚Äù Fox News, June 15, 2006. By the time the group graduated from college the site had earned more than $100,000 and the partners still owned 100 percent of their business, which at that time was attracting 2 million viewers a month. The group moved the company to San Diego briefly before settling in New York City in 2004, where they set up shop in a 4,800 square-foot loft in TriBeCa. By 2005 the site was receiving 6-8 million unique visitors each month and was generating over 5 million dollars per year in advertising and T-shirt sales. In 2006 Abramson and company sold 51% of Connected Ventures, CollegeHumor's parent company, whose properties include CollegeHumor, Vimeo and BustedTees, to Barry Diller‚Äôs IAC/InterActiveCorp for a reported $20 million.Anthony Ha, ‚ÄúT-Shirt Crowdfunding Site TeePublic Funds 22 Designs In Its First Week,‚Äù TechCrunch, March 22, 2013.

The T-shirt designs are submitted by artists, designers, and celebrities, and are curated through crowdsourcing. In October 2018, TeePublic was acquired by Redbubble, a global online marketplace based in Australia, for US$41 million.

It was rushed into release on 30 January, following the international box-office success achieved by its predecessor, the initial mondo film, Mondo Cane, which premiered in Italy ten months earlier, 30 March 1962.Posters, lobby cards, publicity photographs and other images associated with the 1963 Italian entertainment documentary Women of the World The English language print was narrated by Peter Ustinov. Following the pattern set by the original concept and consisting mostly of leftover footage from the first film, Women of the World is, again, a series of travelogue vignettes which provide glimpses into the lives of its title subjects, with the intention of shocking or surprising Western film audiences.Goodall pg. 22 However, unlike the previous film which had no specific central subject matter, but rather presented a kaleidoscopic display of shocking content, the second film was marketed as directly promising a titillating display of feminine flesh and intriguing as well as exotic sexual practices. As with the first film, despite its claims of being a genuine documentary, a number of the depicted scenes are either staged or creatively manipulated.Kerekes pp. 113‚Äì114 Vignettes Israel, Iwa Island, Australia At the start, feminine ability to distract men is emphasized by the roving eyes of servicemen who, wearing their dress uniforms during a festive march down city streets, cannot avert their eyes from the legs, bosoms and faces of the beautiful girls lining the streets. Staying with the military theme, Israeli women soldiers, serving alongside their male counterparts, are shown enjoying nude bathing and then, thousands of kilometers in another direction, Roger Hopkins, a retired Scotsman who once held the rank of colonel, is visited on tropical Iwa Island, 200 km [130 miles] from mainland New Guinea, where he lives with his 84 \\"wives\\", who are aged from about 13 to 18, and their 52 children. On another warm island, off the coast of Australia, the absence of women causes some, many, or most members of the island's male population to act out the roles of seductive mermaids.\\"The B Movie Cult Specializing in Horror Cult and Expolitation: Women of the World (1963, Paolo Cavara, Gualtiero Jacopetti, Franco Prosperi (Wednesday, November 10, 2010)\\" Paris, Ravenna, Sweden, Papua New Guinea, China Turning the focus on Europe, French summer behavior is also shown to elevate the temperature, as July celebrations of Bastille Day in Paris include passionate public kissing among strangers in the streets. Then, to Italy where, in the city of Ravenna, the military statue of 15th century condottiero Guidarello Guidarelli is the object of endless kisses from visiting women who stand in line for the privilege. In a brief look at women's subservient roles in religion, Sweden's sole female minister is shown conducting mass, and then the focus is back in Paris to observe cabarets welcoming homosexuals and lesbians. Returning to the faraway jungles of Papua New Guinea, homosexual tribesman preen while decorating themselves, while the tribeswomen are shown doing endless chores. Back in France, on the nudist √éle du Levant, bodies are fully on display, while in China, women, afraid of sun rays injuring their skin, take outdoor baths while wearing light gowns.Kohler, Will. \\"Gay Propaganda from the Past: 1963 ‚Äì Gualtiero Jacopetti's 'Women of the World' ‚Äì Video\\" (Back2Stonewall We're Here, We're Queer, F@#king Deal with It!, November 1, 2012) New Guinea, Sardinia, Cannes Film Festival, Hollywood, Japan, Malaysia On to New Guinea again, where local women are shown attempting to make their skin less dark by bathing in mud. On the large Italian island of Sardinia, funeral services are enhanced by a paid display of female grief, while back on tropical islands, Tahitian women launch into sensual dance routines. Then, another look at France, as starlets participate in an annual routine at the Cannes Film Festival by stripping down to the briefest of bikinis as they pose and parade for photographers, while their American counterparts in Hollywood are shown marking time in wait for their big break by taking any available employment, such as running an elevator or pumping gas. A photographer takes endless photographs of innumerable women so that he can merge their characteristics into one perfect specimen, while Japanese women seek perfection in surgical enhancements for their breasts and wide-open eyes so that they may resemble women from the \\"West\\". In America, rubber \\"falsies\\" which make breasts appear larger, are a very big industry.

In the South of Italy, sexual activity takes place immediately after the marital vows are pronounced, while the same region's women who died \\"dishonored\\" are not allowed to be interred in marked graves. In Australia, bowls are played on the lawn of a Sydney cemetery by the Sporting Widows Association and, in America, the car is the favorite venue for young women to lose their virginity, a specially built tree house in Honolulu is a popular place for honeymooners to spend their first night and, in Las Vegas dude ranches, cowboys make a habit of visiting and comforting/entertaining women who go there to finalize their divorces.Gibron, Judge Bill. \\"The Mondo Cane Collection\\" (DVD Verdict, November 17, 2003) Japan, Washington, New York, Singapore, Hong Kong, Kenya, Borneo, Arabian desert, New Zealand, Switzerland, Middle East, Lourdes In Japan, dangerous diving for seaweed and pearls is done by women while, in America, powerful women are seen at work ‚Äî United States Treasurer Elizabeth Rudel Smith who inspects the Bureau of Engraving each day and a New York-based female bank president who chairs a meeting of the bank's directors. Back in Southeast Asia, the \\"Sisterhood of the Night Butterflies\\" in Singapore gives thanks for enjoying prosperity during the cycle of business activity, and prostitution in Hong Kong is combatted by female police officers. Faraway and exotic locations are visited as Masai tribe members are baptized by nuns working as missionaries in Kenya, a European fashion pageant appears baffling to native women, tattoos are imprinted upon women in the Borneo jungle, while plastic surgeons cut into the flesh of European women who aspire to improve their appearance. In the Arabian desert, women in Bedouin tribes hold similar hopes as they rub creamed camel effluvia into their facial skin. Childbirth ritual among New Zealand's MƒÅori involves dangerous feats of daring which the men perform while the mothers of their children are giving birth. Remaining with the topic of birth, a clinic in Switzerland is shown giving instructions in painless labor. Women in an Arab conflict zone risk their lives by running into battlefields to collect shrapnel which they sell for scrap metal, collecting small amounts of money to feed their children. At the end, children deformed by the drug Thalidomide are shown with their suffering mothers, while other crestfallen mothers travel to Lourdes as pilgrims to beseech God for their children's cure.Gibron, Bill. \\"The Mondo Cane Collection (1962‚Äì1971) ‚Äì Pop Matters Film Review\\" (1 December 2003) Dedication to Belinda Lee During the opening credits as well as the sequence highlighting the Cannes Film Festival, clips are shown from the Festival's 1955 appearance of English ingenue and leading actress in Italian exploitation films Belinda Lee, who died two years earlier, in a March 1961 auto crash which also injured the film's writers/producers Gualtiero Jacopetti,\\"R.I.P.: Gualtiero Jacopetti 4 September 1919, Tuscany ‚Äì 17 August 2011, Rome\\" (A Wasted Life, Monday, August 22, 2011) with whom she was involved in a personal relationship,\\"Beauty Lies in the Eye of the Beholder: Belinda Lee\\" and Paolo Cavara.

The mall was originally developed by Home Savings and Loan Association, which sold the shopping center to Desert Plaza Partnership. In the early 1980s, Desert Plaza Partnership sold the property to DeBartolo Corporation which expanded and revamped the mall to accommodate more shops. Subsequently, sales declined prompting major retailers to close down business at the Desert Fashion Plaza. In 2002, John Wessman of Wessman Development bought the property and proposed a significant redevelopment on the whole site. Demolition began to take place in 2013, and shops, restaurants, and a six-story hotel have opened on part of the site with more planned. Former anchor tenants in the mall were Saks Fifth Avenue, I. Magnin, and Bank of America. The mall was used as the set for the fictional S'wallow Valley Mall in the 2012 comedy film, Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie. ‚ô¶ Download (Downloadable PDF file) History The site of the Desert Fashion Plaza was formerly a resort hotel named the Desert Inn opened and operated by Nellie Coffman, an early settler of Palm Springs. After Nellie's death in the 1950s, sons George Roberson and Earl Coffman, who had continuously assisted Nellie in the operation of the Inn, sold it in 1955 to actress Marion Davies. By April 1956, there were plans for a $4.5 million, five story hotel and shopping center on the site. The project would have originally included a swimming pool, a Las Vegas-style restaurant, and a theater for both Broadway plays and cinema films during the winter and summer seasons, respectively. The hotel itself would accommodate 200 rooms and suites, along with a parking space for 1,000 cars. Victor Gruen and Associates were to be the architects to design the project, with Joseph Bliti of New York being contracted for the proposed construction. The proposed center was scheduled for completion by November 1957. However, the plans never came to fruition due to Davies's health deteriorating at the time. Davies eventually sold the land for $2.5 million to developers Samuel Firks and George Alexander in 1960. Alexander and Firks originally envisioned an eight-story hotel that would accommodate 300 rooms and a 1,600 parking space facility for a proposed $4 million. Plans for redeveloping the Desert Inn fell, which prompted the Alexander Construction Company to focus more of using the property for commercial use instead. On November 14, 1965, Alexander and his spouse Mildred, alongside with their son Robert and his wife Helene, were all killed when their plane impacted shortly after taking off from Palm Springs International Airport. The plane was expected to reach Hollywood-Lockheed Air Terminal, but the plane lost control while in flight and collided into the Chocolate Mountains region near Indio, California. All plans for redeveloping the old site were dropped. Operation After Alexander's death, Home Savings and Loan Association obtained the Desert Inn property in 1966. That same year, developer Joseph K. Eichenbaum released a statement on plans of constructing a multi-million dollar commercial center on the old site. Architect Charles Luckman was commissioned to design the new shopping mall. Demolition of the Desert Inn began in August 1966. The Desert Inn Fashion Plaza was officially opened to the public on October 16, 1967 with the grand opening of a 20,000 square-foot I. Magnin, which represented the retailer's return to Palm Springs after its 1933‚Äì1942 presence with a resort shop at the El Mirador Hotel. A month before the mall opened, Luckman and Leonard R. Lockhart, first vice president of Home Savings and Loan Associates, were both honored by Southern California Edison for the all-electrical design. In 1969, Joseph Magnin Co. broke ground on a 26,000 square foot department store in the mall. The new store would anchor at the corner of North Palm Canyon Drive and Andreas Road, and was set to open in September the same year. San Francisco- based architects, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, would design the store, along with contractors Diversified Builders, Inc. In addition, 12 other major establishments also opened up in the new mall since the past two years, including: Bank of America, Belmont Savings & Loan, P'iddlers Three Restaurant, Stuard's Sahara, Silverwoods, Islamania, Michael's, Robert Sands Hairstyling, Master's Candies, Village Card & Gift Shop and Orange Julius. In 1978, Home Savings and Loan Associates sold the Desert Inn Fashion Plaza to Desert Plaza Partnership. The group compromised Arthur Gilbert, David Blum and Gerson Fox; three partners that were based in Los Angeles. Expansion During the 1980s, major shopping destinations such as Palm Desert Town Center and the El Paseo Shopping District were growing rapidly in Palm Desert, California. National chains also opened up businesses throughout the Palm Desert area. Because of this, most local shops that were in the central hub of Palm Springs began to shift away into other areas that were also seeing growth. This situation prompted Desert Plaza Partnership to focus on plans of expanding the mall. In 1983, Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. announced an agreement with Desert Plaza Partnership to renovate the Desert Inn Fashion Plaza for $42 million. The Ohio-based corporation planned to enlarge the mall to accommodate more tenants, a six-story hotel, and underground parking. Meanwhile, the local redevelopment agency was authorized to help developers acquire the additional property needed for the potential project. In 1984, redevelopment took place by first razing historic-period buildings on the site, and setting up the new section on top. At the same time, Joseph Magnin announced that they would close their remaining 24 stores, including the one in Palm Springs due to bankruptcy. The mall was officially opened on November 16, 1985 under the new name of Desert Fashion Plaza. I. Magnin and Saks Fifth Avenue would serve as the main anchors of the newly-redeveloped mall, as well as a hotel called Maxim's Paris Suite Hotel. Decline Despite the success from the new stores that were opened, it wasn't enough to fulfill the traffic of shoppers. In the years to come, retail sales declined and by 1991, Silverwoods men's clothing and Marie Callender's moved out of the still partially vacant Desert Fashion Plaza. Hyatt Regency Suites bought the hotel management and renamed it as Hyatt Palm Springs. In 1992, R.H. Macy & Co. closed the Palm Springs location of I. Magnin after several years in operation citing that their store was not a ‚Äúsuitable location\\" at the Desert Fashion Plaza. In 1995, developer Mark Bragg, a former adviser to Ronald Reagan, and the ever-present Eddie DeBartolo Jr. teamed up to pass a measure which approved card clubs at three sites: two controlled by Bragg, and the third at DeBartolo's Desert Fashion Plaza mall. Palm Springs voted a ballot by a 2-to-1 margin for the gambling establishment. At a cost of $13.5 million, Phoenix-based Arizona Partners became the new owners of Desert Fashion Plaza. Arizona Partners planned on expanding the Desert Fashion Plaza to over 350,000 square feet and removing the roof to make the mall open-air. The main entrance was to be an open air plaza with outdoor dining, shops, and gather places, plus a 3,000-seat cinema and a 2,400 seat live theater; the project would have been renamed The Promenade. The first phase of the project would begin in mid-1998 and be completed sometime at the end of the year. By the beginning of 1999, about 75% of the tenants inside the mall were closed down. At the same time, San Diego- based Excel Legacy Corporation scrapped Arizona Partners's concepts and proposed its own project. Developer MBK Southern California Ltd. would design the center. Their decision was to bulldoze the whole mall and replace it with an open air plaza. Proposed tenants included Saks, a two-story multiplex theater, a food court, gourmet market, restaurants and various specialty shops. However, the concept was never realized and decided to sell the mall for an asking price of $25 million. In 2000, the Agua Caliente Development Authority, a subsidiary of the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians, planned on purchasing and redeveloping Palm Springs‚Äô Desert Fashion Plaza by discussion through Palm Springs city officials and the director of the Palm Springs Desert Museum. Agua Caliente made the decision to not to buy the property. Developer John Wessman purchased the Desert Fashion Plaza and initially planned a Spanish-Mediterranean plaza on the site. Simultaneously, Saks Fifth Avenue closed down their location and moved to a new store in the El Paseo shopping district down in Palm Desert. At the same time, the attacks on September 11, 2001 caused the project to slow down. Demolition and Redevelopment In 2011, it announced that workers were to begin the process of removing the large tent behind the mall, which removed in several phrases with the first stage. It is an agreement between development and the city of Palm Springs.https://kesq.com/news/2011/03/08/first-phase-of-desert-fashion- plaza-redevelopment-begins/ After more than a decade since the mall sat empty, redevelopment finally moved forward on February 7, 2013 with the demolition of the mall. The large, vacant property would be turned into an outdoor shopping center with new shops, restaurants, and a six-story hotel. Wessman pledged that demolition of the plaza would take just four months, and that 90% of the materials would be recycled.https://la.curbed.com/2013/1/4/10289178/desert- fashion-plaza-overhaul-bringing-three-new-blocks-of-retail Before construction commenced in the middle of the same year, a lawsuit was filed by Frank Tysen, a member of the Citizens for a Sustainable Palm Springs, and owner of Casa Cody Bed & Breakfast. Tysen and his group were suing because it believes the city did not follow the proper protocol when it came to a petition that was submitted. The petition asked the city to place a portion of the concept on a ticket. However, the city of Palm Springs opted out of the deal saying that the redevelopment action was considered as administrative, and not legislative action. In April 2014, the court denied the halt of the project. The mall was demolished in 2014 and the area will be mixed-use buildings lining traditional downtown city streets. A Kimpton Hotel (De Rowan) opened in 2017 on the southeast portion of the site, the first part to be built on again.https://www.palmspringsca.gov/home/showdocument?id=33582 This area also has an H&M; and other shops and restaurants.https://www.latimes.com/travel/deals/la-tr-palm-springs- hotels-20171022-story.html References Shopping malls in Riverside County, California Buildings and structures in Palm Springs, California Shopping malls established in 1967 1967 establishments in California 1992 disestablishments in California Defunct shopping malls in the United States Buildings and structures demolished in 2013 Demolished buildings and structures in California ","title":"Desert Fashion Plaza"},{"id":"47089321","text":"The French brig Observateur, which was launched in 1800 for the French Navy, was a Vigilant-class 16-gun brig, one of six built to a design by Pierre-Alexandre-Laurent Forfait. The Royal Navy captured her in 1806 and took her into service as HMS Observateur. She participated in two actions, one for the French Navy and one for the Royal Navy, and one campaign before she was laid up in 1810. The Navy did not succeed in selling her until 1814. French service The French Navy commissioned Observateur in 1802 and by 4 October 1802 she was under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Bonamy, having sailed from Havre to Newfoundland protecting French fisherman, and then returning to Brest.Fonds Marine (1780‚Äì1804), p. 270. Then between 8 April 1803 and 13 September, still under the command of Bonamy, by now a capitaine de fr√©gate, Observateur returned from Saint-Domingue to Brest, cruised to the region around Santa Maria Island, and then returned to Corogne, finishing at Ferrol.Fonds Marine (1780‚Äì1804), p. 287. On 28 January 1806 Observateur was under the command of Lieutenant de vaisseau Jean Croizƒó and part of the Ferrol squadron. She sailed with the combined fleet from Ferrol to Cadiz.Fonds Marine (1805‚Äì1826), p.331. Then between 1 March and 4 April, Observateur sailed from Cadiz to Cayenne. She was in company with her sister-ship Argus, under the command of Lieutenant de vaisseau Yves-Fran√ßois Taillard, the senior commander. On 3 March they encountered a British corvette in the Atlantic.Fonds Marine (1805‚Äì1826), p.349. Argus was eager to escape and abandoned Observateur. Observateur sailed less well and a single-ship action ensued, during which she suffered several casualties, both dead and wounded. Neither side was able to prevail, and though Observateur lost her bowsprit while attempting to board the British vessel, the British vessel did not pursue her advantage that evening. Next morning combat resumed, but at a distance and the British vessel withdrew, freeing Observateur to make for Santa Cruz de Tenerife. Although Observateur was unable to determine the name of her adversary, despite retaining a British flag that had somehow fallen aboard during the boarding attempt, Croiz√© was able to determine that she was a three-master armed with 26 guns. On 6 March, as Observateur approached the port a British lugger approached and a new engagement ensued. Fortunately, the governor of Teneriffe sent out another brig and two schooners to chase the lugger off and escort Observateur to safety. Observateur spent 40 days there refitting before she sailed again for Cayenne where she met up again with Argus. Capture On 9 June 1806 the frigate , in company with , captured Observateur after a chase and a slight exchange of gunfire. Observateur, of 16 guns, though pierced for 20, had a crew of 104. She had left Cayenne on 15 March provisioned for a cruise of four months and in company with the French brig Argus, but had not taken anything. Several days prior to the engagement Croiz√© had taken ill; he had, therefore, relinquished command to his second- in-command, enseigne de vaisseau Robert-Henri Debernes. One problem confronting Observateur was that although she carried four British 12-pounder carronades in addition to her twelve 4-pounder guns, the only shot she had for the 12-pounders were actually for 8-pounders. British service The Royal Navy immediately took her into service as HMS Observateur. Admiral John Poer Beresford, chief of the Halifax station, wrote that the officers of the yard there spoke so highly of Observateur that he commissioned her there under Lieutenant the Honourable George Alfred Crofton (acting). Beresford gave Crofton a complete crew of officers and men and instructed him to sail to Bermuda to search for Argus. Venelia, Eldridge, master, arrived at Bermuda on 19 July 1806. She had been sailing from New York to Martinique when Observateur detained her.Lloyd's List (LL) 29 August 1806, n¬∞ 4077. A week later the American vessel Huntress, Dodge, master, arrived at Bermuda also. She had been sailing from New York to New Orleans when Observateur detained her.LL 9 September 1806, n¬∞4080. Lastly, in December, Observateur detained and sent into Bermuda Eliza, Gardner, master, which had been sailing from Cap Francois to Saint Bartholomew.LL 30 December 1806, n¬∞4113. In February 1807 Commander William Love replaced Crofton. However, on 17 December Observateur was under the command of Commander Charles Claridge when she captured Mars. In January 1808 Lieutenant John Lawrence took command; he received his promotion to Commander in March. Later that year Commander Richard Smith replaced Lawrence. Lieutenant Frederick Wetherall (or Weatherall) took temporary command in December 1809. On 13 December Observateur was off Antigua and in company with Junon when they sighted four unknown ships heading west towards Guadeloupe. Both British vessels turned to intercept, with Observateur in the lead. Wetherall identified the four as frigates rather than merchantmen and signaled this information to Junon, Observateur then cleared for action. When the two British ships were within long range, Observateur fired a warning shot and both she and Junon moved to close with the lead frigate preparatory to engaging them. However as the British ships approached, the lead frigate ran up a Spanish flag, shortly followed by the British Red Ensign. Believing the unknown ships to be Spanish allies, Wetherall and Shortland reduced sail and Junon moved to come alongside the lead frigate to permit Captain Shortland to exchange greetings with her captain. When Junon was close, the lead frigate suddenly hauled down her Spanish and British flags and raised the French ensign. The following three frigates followed suit, and all four opened fire on Junon at short range. Junons crew were taken by surprise; a ragged retaliatory broadside struck two of the French ships but caused little damage. Junon herself received broadsides to her port, starboard and stern and quickly became indefensible; her crew surrendered after French soldiers boarded her. A total of 15 British sailors were killed and 44 wounded, including Shortland. Observateur fired upon the French when the engagement began but Junons capture was too swift for her to directly assist Junon. Instead, Wetherall made sail and escaped to the west. The French frigates were Clorinde, Renomm√©e, Loire and Seine, en route to Guadeloupe with supplies and reinforcements for the colony. Overall command rested with Captain Dominque Roquebert aboard Clorinde. Roquebert's logs indicate he had not initially intended to engage the British, and had raised the Spanish flag in the hope that they would leave his ships alone. However, when Junon and Observateur drew near, Roquebert decide to continue with the ruse of the false flag to lure the British into range of all four French vessels at the same time. The French suffered 80 casualties, including 34 killed. All casualties were from among the crews of Clorinde and Renomm√©e which had come alongside Junon during the battle. Seine and Loire had engaged the British ship from the rear and had not come under fire from either Junon or Observateur. Wetherall sailed to Marie Galante where he advised Admiral Alexander Cochrane that the French had captured and burnt Junon. On 18 December arrived and informed Cochrane that two of the frigates he was seeking were anchored some three leagues NW of Basse-Terre. Cochrane immediately set out in , together with a number of other vessels. There Cochrane found that Captain Samuel James Ballard in had a squadron in place and was preparing to attack Seine and Loire, anchored in Anse √† la Barque (\\"Barque Cove\\"). The British attack was successful in that the French abandoned Seine and Loire and set fire to them. Observateur participated in the capture of Guadeloupe in January and February 1810. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Guadaloupe\\" to all surviving participants of the campaign. George, Lovell, master, was sailing from Boston to Havana when Observateur detained her. George arrived in Bermuda on 26 March 1810.n¬∞4462.. Observateur was temporarily under the command of Commander Henry Jane (acting). Jane was appointed to the sloop on the Halifax station on 10 May 1810,Marshall (1831), Vol. 3, Part 1, p.223. and Wetheral remained in command until November. By end-October Observateur was at Sheerness. Fate Observateur arrived at Deptford on 4 November 1810, where she was laid up. The Principal Officers and Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy offered the \\"Observateur Brig, 310 Tons\\" for sale on 27 November 1811. She did not sell on that date, nor on several later occasions in 1814. The Navy finally sold her for ¬£640 on 1 September 1814.

ABC Family promoted the finale with the slogan \\"#facetoface\\", which served as an indication that the mysterious villain \\"A\\" would be revealed in the mid-season finale. In the episode, Alison, Aria, Emily, Hanna, Spencer and Mona finally uncover the true identity of \\"A,\\" who turns out to be CeCe Drake, and they learn why she has been tormenting them. In addition, the episode includes a time jump, as the Liars return to Rosewood after being away for five years. \\"Game Over, Charles\\" was watched by 3.09 million viewers and garnered a 1.4 rating, making it the most-watched episode of the sixth season, and the most-watched episode since the fourth season finale \\"A Is for Answers,\\" up from the previous episode.  Plot  At the prom, Aria (Lucy Hale), Emily (Shay Mitchell), Hanna (Ashley Benson), Spencer (Troian Bellisario) and Sara Harvey (Dre Davis) meet Mona (Janel Parrish), who reveals that she has been following Alison (Sasha Pieterse) all night to protect her. Mona locates Alison's phone at the Carissimi Group building, and the girls head to the company's headquarters. There, Spencer breaks into a restricted room after Sara remembers a specific date meaningful to Charles, which is the code for unlocking the door. While the girls enter the room, Sara refuses to accompany them. They discover a hologram which monitors a live feed of the room that Alison has been taken to. As the girls witness Alison discovering Jason and Mr. DiLaurentis's unconscious bodies, they realize she's alone with \\"A,\\" who is revealed to be CeCe Drake (Vanessa Ray). With everyone in the DiLaurentis family present, CeCe begins to tell them her story. She reveals that she was born as a boy named Charles DiLaurentis. When she was eight years old, she gave Alison a bath, but accidentally dropped her in the scalding water. Kenneth saved Alison, but Charles was admitted to Radley as a consequence. According to CeCe, as a child she asked her mother to purchase her dresses, but Kenneth despised his son for being feminine, so he used the bathtub incident as an excuse to send him away. Jessica paid a visit to Charles as often as she could, in an attempt to make him feel less alienated. When Charles was 12 years old, Bethany Young pushed Toby's mother, Marion Cavanaugh, off Radley's roof. However, Bethany blamed Charles for Marion's homicide, and everyone believed her word due to Charles sporting a dress at the time of the incident and refusing to be seen in it. Jessica paid off Darren Wilden (Bryce Johnson) to make sure Mrs. Cavanaugh's death was ruled a suicide. Charles was diagnosed with intermittent explosive disorder (IED), although this was actually an accurate diagnosis for Bethany. For the next two years, Charles was heavily medicated with tranquilizers, but he was let out to attend his fake funeral. After the funeral at Aunt Carol's, Jessica finally accepted Charles as her daughter and took her back to Radley, renamed Charlotte. Charlotte dedicated herself to math as a way to escape reality. She did so well in her studies that she was allowed to attend classes at the University of Pennsylvania. She thought going to school would be fun, but it was easy for her since she already knew what she was being taught. One day, she called in a bomb threat to cancel classes. She used the opportunity to go to Rosewood High for yearbook picture day, where she met Jason, whom she began dating under the CeCe Drake alias in order to get closer to her family. Jessica didn't know that CeCe Drake and Charlotte were the same person until the day the DiLaurentises were leaving for Cape May. Although initially angered at her children's incestuous relationship, Jessica allows Charlotte to go on vacation with the rest of the family. In Cape May, Charlotte became close friends with Alison and even planned to tell her they were related. However, Bethany found out about Mrs. D's affair with her father, thus ruining Charlotte's opportunity to tell her sister the truth. On Labor Day Weekend, Bethany stole Charlotte‚Äôs clothes and snuck out of Radley to murder Jessica at the DiLaurentis property. This led to Charlotte accidentally bashing Alison in the head with a rock that night, believing she was Bethany. Jessica buried Alison out of panic and paid Wilden to take Charlotte back to Radley. Back at the Carissimi Group, Mona tearfully admits that she hit Bethany that night and mistook her for Alison, since they both had blonde hair and were wearing the same clothes. The medical staff at Radley took away Charlotte's privilege to occasionally leave Radley, but, once Mona was admitted to the sanitarium, Charlotte took advantage of her drugged up state and manipulated her into telling her everything she had done as \\"A\\". After Charlotte was released from Radley, she moved to Rosewood, where she purposely met the Liars, and began hating the girls due to their relief over Alison's disappearance. Charlotte kept seeing Alison in the Red Coat and thought she was going crazy at first. So, in order to lure Alison out, she planned the Thornhill Lodge party. She sent a decoy Red Coat to go in her place and confuse the Liars. The decoy Red Coat unmasks herself as Sara Harvey. Alison and the Liars are shocked by this and Charlotte says Sara was Red Coat when she needed her to be. Charlotte's intentions were to lure Alison out of hiding, but Shana set fire to the lodge. Nonetheless, Sara and Alison rescued the girls, thereby giving Charlotte the much needed confirmation that her sister was alive. She killed Wilden to protect Alison, since he would've never allowed her to return to Rosewood, and sent Sara to his funeral, costumed as the Black Widow, to ensure he was deceased. Before Charlotte fled to New York, she snuck home to say goodbye to her mother, only to find her lifeless body lying in the DiLaurentises' backyard. Following her mother's passing, she saw the events in New York as the perfect opportunity to end the \\"A\\" game and begin a new life in Paris, but eventually came back, due to her addiction to power. Sara, dressed as Red Coat, sets a bomb to detonate inside Radley as part of Charlotte's final plan to kill her family and herself. The Liars arrive in time for Spencer to disable the bomb while Emily punches Sara for betraying her. Charlotte runs towards the roof and attempts to commit suicide. However, the Liars arrive in time to persuade her not to do so, and Charlotte, instead, declares the end of her reign as A.  Three Months Later  On Labor Day weekend, the five Liars stand outside Alison's house, with their cars all packed and ready to leave for college. The girls hug each other as they say goodbye, not realizing leaving would be so hard.  Five Years Later  Alison is working as a teacher at Rosewood High. As she writes the name \\"Mrs. Rollins\\" on a classroom board, she is interrupted by Aria, Hanna, Emily, and Spencer, who rush into her classroom to inform her that an unknown male is pursuing her.  Production  \\"Game Over, Charles\\" was written and directed by showrunner I. Marlene King, which serves as King's second writing credit of the sixth season, and the fifth directed episode of the series. King began writing the mid-season finale, the \\"summer finale\\", which will be titled \\"Game Over, Charles\\", on May 12, 2015. Filming began on June 9, 2015 and ended on June 18, 2015. King revealed the title of the episode on March 25, 2015, after revealing the title of the premiere, which was \\"Game On, Charles\\". ABC Family promoted the finale on Twitter with the slogan \\"#FAceToFace\\" indicating the reveal of 'A' in the mid-season finale. On June 4, 2015, it was announced by King on Twitter that the actor/actress who will play 'A' had been told that they were going to be 'A' in the show. The episode featured the song \\"How Does It Feel\\" by MS MR. The episode focuses on the reveal of 'A' as the Liars and Alison discovers who their tormentor is and why they became 'A'. Executive producer Oliver Goldstick revealed in an interview that the first half of the sixth season, would contain 10 episodes instead of 12, like the previous seasons and will deal almost exclusively with the mystery of Charles DiLaurentis and every unanswered \\"A\\" mystery question since the start of the show. King said that \\"This is our chance to finally end this great and wonderful story.\\" In an interview with Entertainment Online, I. Marlene King said that the sixth season \\"is about answers and closure for all of them. It is an ending to the story that we started so long ago, but it's a very fast- paced ending to the story.\\" King revealed that the Liars will graduate in the mid-season finale, and it will feature a five-year time jump to when the Liars are finished with college. Goldstick commented that \\"We‚Äôve been talking about [the time jump] for years.\\" Goldstick said in regards to the threats by 'A' and the time jump, that ‚ÄúIt gives us an opportunity to see what was the gift of ‚ÄòA.‚Äô What was the gift of ‚ÄòA‚Äô that edified all of these girls in different ways?‚Äù Marlene King expressed her excitement in an interview with Entertainment Tonight to tell more grown-up stories for the characters as she said that the actresses had \\"outgrown the teenager years\\". Lucy Hale commented on the five-year time jump as she said ‚ÄúWe couldn‚Äôt have asked for anything better.\\" Shay Mitchell also commented on how the show is going to be different, as she also added that \\"This feels like a new beginning\\". As a regard to who 'A' is going to be, King said \\"We knew that Mona was the original \\"A,\\" but we didn't know how long we were going to be able to go to sustain that story before we gave her up to the audience. We knew there was going to be a \\"Big A\\" to follow that story up, and we stayed true to those characters.\\" King revealed in an interview with BuzzFeed that because of the frustration from the audience, the final 'A' reveal was moved from the series finale to the sixth season mid-season finale. She continued saying that \\"The fans have been really patient, and I feel like we pushed them as far as we could.\\" The story of Charles was pitched by King to the writer's room after the end of the second season, after the reveal of Mona as 'A'. King said - Joseph Dougherty, executive producer, expressed his concern over the amount of material the writers had to deal with in the first half of the sixth season in order to reveal who 'A' is when crafting the first ten episodes. He continued to call the season four finale \\"the previous high-water mark for maximum signal-to-noise information.\\" King revealed in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter that \\"lots of people\\" have correctly guessed A's identity\\", but noted that fans would still be shocked to learn A's motives for living a life devoted to stalking. \\"The 'who' has been guessed, but the 'how' and 'why'? Not so much.\\" Troian Bellisario said in an interview that \\"it was thrilling to watch this mysterious actor \\"really stretch their legs\\" as 'A' in Tuesday's summer finale. \\"They were just fantastic. I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt be more specific, but that was the best part of this episode.\\"  Reception   Broadcasting  \\"Game Over, Charles\\" premiered on ABC Family on August 11, 2015. It was watched by 3.09 million viewers and acquired a 1.4 rating in the 18-49 demographic, making it the most watched episode of the sixth season, and the most watched episode since \\"A Is for Answers\\", the fourth season finale, which aired in March 2013. It was up from the previous episode, the penultimate episode \\"Last Dance\\", which was watched by 2.03 million people.  Reviews  Vanessa Ray's (pictured) performance in this episode was critically acclaimed, and earned her a Teen Choice Award. The episode deeply divided fans, since some viewers expressed considerable dissatisfaction in regards to CeCe Drake's motives for becoming the show's primary antagonist as well as Sara Harvey's reveal as the third Red Coat and Black Widow. Critics were generally unfavorable towards the episode, though particular praise was given to Vanessa Ray's performance and the inclusion of a transgender storyline. The episode currently holds a 5.2/10 rating on TV.com and a 4.7/10 rating on IMDb. Morgan Glennon from Buddy TV wrote that it was not the show's best finale \\"by a long shot\\". \\"It's nice to get the answers to most of the show's big questions [...] but the revelations come so fast and so furious that some of the big moments have no time to land. [...] This gives these moments no time to breathe and takes some of the power out of these giant revelations.\\" Nick Campbell of TV.com had mixed opinions on the episode. Although he described it as \\"an episode that fulfilled its promises,\\" finding that CeCe as A was \\"a solution that fits\\" and Sara Harvey as Red Coat \\"added up beautifully,\\" Campbell noted that it was \\"a flashback to cornier times.\\" He was ultimately dissatisfied with the conclusion of the game, which \\"felt like a relic. It's an artifact.\\" He also criticized the mass of information given, which \\"may have been tough to analyze\\". He thought the reactions of the Liars to the reveal \\"made little sense\\" as \\"they all turned to mush\\". The A.V. Club reviewer LaToya Ferguson wrote that the choice of having CeCe Drake being A/Charles was \\"the best decision\\" instead of choosing Wren. To her, it could have turned out worse, alluding to Gossip Girl's reveal. Ferguson applauded Vanessa Ray's emotional performance \\"reminding the audience (and characters) why they were drawn to CeCe in the first place\\". She highlighted how Cece manages to make her wrongdoings acceptable, almost redeeming herself. She wrote that Ray \\"absolutely carries this episode on her back, in a way very few secondary characters could.\\" While she described the episode as \\"quite sweeping\\", she felt it was impossible to compare it to previous ones because the Liars only acted as \\"tertiary characters\\", which was unusual. Writing for The Washington Post, Bethonie Butler agreed that the identity of A made more sense than Gossip Girl's reveal, although it was, in her opinion, obvious and disappointing. Further, with regards to the flash-forward, Butler wrote: \\"it‚Äôs kind of odd to spend all that time in high school, only to breeze through college and land abruptly into adulthood.\\" Writing for SpoilerTV, Gavin Hetherington wrote of mixed feelings brought about by the mid-season finale, saying \\"you know when you just don't feel fully happy with something and you just have that little leftover feeling of disappointment? What I love and hate about this show is that it makes me feel like this a lot and I always seem to have mixed feelings when it comes to sharing my opinions on an episode. This was a good, dramatic summer finale but I think the thing I'm most disappointed about was that most of it was just standing and talking.\\" He elaborated and said, \\"As much as I wasn't shocked to the core about CeCe being A, I do like that she is as her story makes sense and her connections to the girls.\\" Paul Dailly of TV Fanatic enjoyed the episode, writing that the reveal \\"surprisingly lived up to the hype. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, it was a bit rough around the edges, but it all made sense and for the first time in ages. [...] We have solid answers and the show is heading off in an exciting direction!\\" He concluded, saying: \\"It was an interesting conclusion that's rebooted the show in a lot of ways. Entertainment Weekly's Isabella Biedenharn deemed the reveal \\"satisfying\\", saying she did not understand people's disappointment and that Wren or one of the Liars \\"would have made no sense\\". Biedenharn called Vanessa Ray \\"fantastic\\" and \\"compelling\\". She opined that the episode, \\"the biggest in PLL history\\", deserved at least two hours. Vanessa Ray won a Teen Choice Award for Choice TV Villain for her performance in this episode.

The Naval Service Diving Section specialises in underwater diving tasks for the Naval Service, and since its formation in the early 1960s has become Ireland's most advanced diving team, aiding other state agencies in various specialist roles. Roles The main roles of the NSDS are:- * Search and recovery * Underwater survey * Explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) * Underwater engineering * Military diving training The NSDS will reportedly be developing a Mine Counter Measures capability to protect sea lanes. Organisation The Diving Section was officially established in 1964 when Commodore Joe Deasy (then a lieutenant) brought back skills he learned from the British Royal Navy to the Irish Naval Service. During the mid-1980s, the diver training course was set up at Haulbowline Naval Base, Cork Harbour, and since then over 1,400 Naval Service men and women have applied to join the elite unit, with just 150 succeeding (a pass rate of just 9.3%), all men. Each year around 50 Naval Service personnel apply to join the unit, roughly 15 of these are selected for the 11-week Naval Diving Course and on average just 5 complete it. The course is conducted during the winter months to prepare divers for the harshest conditions. Each diver needs to undertake 17 separate training courses to stay current on the section's equipment. The NSDS operates a 24-hour on-call capability, ready to respond rapidly to any tasking around the state. The NSDS is the only International Diving Schools Association (IDSA) accredited diving school in Ireland. The Naval Service Diving Section provides specialised training and certification for the special operations unit of the Irish Defence Forces, responsible for the provision of air and combat diving technique training for the Army Ranger Wing (ARW) Combat Diving Section. The NSDS conducts EOD and explosive ordnance reconnaissance (EOR) training alongside diving units of the Royal Navy and Royal Canadian Navy. Domestic operations In 1973, the NSDS was involved in its first high- profile operation during the interception of the Claudia, a vessel importing arms for the Provisional IRA. In 1979, the section was tasked to assist during the Whiddy Island disaster, in which the oil tanker Betelgeuse exploded in Bantry Bay claiming the lives of 50 people. In 1985, they were was tasked with the search and recovery operation of Air India Flight 182, which came down off the south-west Irish coast in the deadliest terrorist bombing in aviation history, resulting in the deaths of 329 people. Two of the divers involved in that operation were awarded Distinguished Service Medals (DSM). Overseas operations NSDS teams have been involved in \\"Operation PONTUS\\" from 2015 onward, aboard Irish Naval Service vessels in the Mediterranean Sea as part of the European Union's humanitarian response to the European migrant crisis.

Keplinger was 17 when she wrote the novel, which was released on June 7, 2011.Site Search Hachette Book Group A film based on the novel, also entitled The DUFF, was released in 2015. The film was a success, and only had a budget of $8.5 million. A companion novel Lying Out Loud was released on April 28, 2015 and is set in the same world as The DUFF. Summary High school student Bianca Piper, along with her friends Casey Blithe and Jessica Gaither, frequent a teen lounge called the Nest. One January night as Casey and Jessica are dancing, another student named Wesley Rush, who has a reputation as a womanizer, approaches Bianca. He explains that he wants people to see him talking with her, because she is the ‚ÄúDuff,‚Äù the Designated Ugly Fat Friend, and a connection with her will bring other, more attractive women to him. Disgusted, Bianca finds her friends and leaves. A few nights later, however, Wesley approaches Bianca at the club again after Bianca had a particularly bad day, and Bianca spontaneously kisses Wesley in order to distract herself from her problems. Bianca‚Äôs mother Gina, a self-help lecturer, has been disappearing for longer and longer periods of time on her business trips, and one day she sends Bianca‚Äôs father, Mike, divorce papers. This drives Mike Piper to start drinking again and to demolish the living room, and when Wesley plans to come to Bianca‚Äôs house to work on an English paper together on the novel The Scarlet Letter, Bianca suggests going to Wesley‚Äôs house instead so that no one finds out about her parents‚Äô divorce. In Wesley‚Äôs room Bianca kisses him again and ends up sleeping with him. She insists, however, that she hates him, and he continues to address her as ‚ÄúDuffy.‚Äù Bianca does not tell Casey or Jessica about sleeping with Wesley, or about her parents‚Äô divorce. In school, Jessica says that her older brother Jake is coming to visit, and Bianca remembers an ill-fated affair she once had with Jake. The stirring of this memory prompts her to approach Wesley again for distraction, and soon she starts a casual relationship with him, sleeping with him every few days. She tells him about Jake Gaither, but refuses to tell Jessica or Casey anything and begins to avoid them, though she eventually talks about her parents‚Äô divorce. On Valentine‚Äôs Day, Bianca‚Äôs longtime crush Toby Tucker begins to pay attention to her, and Gina Piper comes to discuss the divorce with Bianca‚Äôs father. This causes Mike to relapse into alcoholism. One day at school Bianca‚Äôs car will not start in the afternoon, and so Wesley gives her a ride. Bianca meets Wesley‚Äôs sister Amy and their grandmother, and learns about Wesley‚Äôs own family troubles. When they go to Bianca‚Äôs house, a drunken Mike calls Bianca a \\"whore\\", and Bianca ends up going back to Wesley‚Äôs house and telling him all about her parents‚Äô divorce. After spending the night with Wesley, Bianca calls Casey and asks for a ride home, and on the way Bianca tells Casey about her relationship with Wesley (as well as the ‚ÄúDuff‚Äù concept). Bianca admits that she has feelings for Wesley, and she wonders if she is in love with him. Mike Piper stops drinking and starts attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Bianca makes up with Jessica and Casey and avoids Wesley altogether, and Toby Tucker asks Bianca out. Toby and Bianca begin dating, but Wesley takes to following Bianca around, leaving her notes, even sending her flowers. On Toby‚Äôs suggestion, Bianca reads Wuthering Heights. Unexpectedly, she sees her situation between Wesley and Toby as analogous to Catherine Earnshaw‚Äôs situation, between Heathcliff and Edgar Linton. Bianca also realizes that her status as a ‚ÄúDuff‚Äù is illusory and unimportant, since other people sometimes act as the odd one in a group and later become popular or successful. She vows to stop judging people, since she wishes to avoid judgment from others. Finally, Toby takes Bianca on a date to the Nest but notices Wesley staring at her, and Toby reveals that he does not feel chemistry with Bianca and is hoping to get back together with his ex- girlfriend, Nina. Toby and Bianca part amicably, and Bianca joins Wesley at the Nest, requesting that they begin dating like normal people. Development Keplinger first heard the term \\"Duff\\" in her high school: > \\"The DUFF\\" started as a joke her senior year when Keplinger, who graduated > from McLean County High School in 2009, first heard the phrase DUFF, or > Designated Ugly Fat Friend. Shortly after Christmas, she walked into the > cafeteria one morning. A girl at her table was talking about guys calling > her friend \\"the DUFF.\\" Keplinger didn't know what that meant, so when they > told her, \\"I had these three thoughts,\\" she said. \\"First, 'that's really > funny.' Second, 'that's really mean.' Third, 'that's me. I'm the DUFF.\\" > \\"I realized every person thinks they're the DUFF in their group,\\" she said. > Jokingly, she told her friends she would write a book called \\"The DUFF.\\" Keplinger also said in a webcast: > I started writing the book, because I thought I was the DUFF of my group of > friends. But the more I wrote, and the more I began talking to my friends > about what I was writing, I realized that every girl has felt like the DUFF > at some point or another. Every girl - and maybe boys too - has felt like > the least attractive person in the room at some time. So we're not alone in > that. It's a lesson that I had to learn, and it's a lesson that Bianca has > to learn too. Reception Andrea Simakis of The Plain Dealer, wrote that the novel \\"gives off a whiff of promise, like a pleasing sample scent you spray on your wrist at Sephora. It's only hours later, when the odor has become cloying, that you're glad you didn't buy.\\" She admits that it has \\"some dead-on dialogue, deft writing and entertaining snark,\\" but concludes that \\"the only true longing in this novel will be from the reader, pining for the clever innocence of Clueless.\\" Amanda Tew of The Florida Times-Union was more complimentary. She wrote, \\"I loved the main character and the chemistry she shared with Wesley and her BFFs. Every girl can easily relate to Bianca - we all have felt like the DUFF at some point.\\" She warned, however, \\"I can't recommend it for all ages. It's a little heavy on sexual content and might give younger girls the wrong idea about appropriate behavior.\\" The Guardian gave it a positive review: \\"Although The DUFF contains steamy scenes and a love triangle sure to keep the pages turning, Keplinger addresses more serious themes, too: body image, alcoholism and the sacrifices of friendship. She also has a knack for writing in an authentic teen voice. This very much keeps the book alive.\\" Film A movie adaptation, starring Mae Whitman as Bianca and Robbie Amell as Wesley and directed by Ari Sandel, was released in 2015.

The attacks continued into 28 June, with the last remaining ISIL militant being killed on the following day. The attacks resulted in 223‚Äì233 civilians dead, as well as 35‚Äì37 Kurdish militiamen and at least 79 ISIL assailants. It was the second-largest massacre committed by ISIL since it declared a caliphate in June 2014. Background The People's Protection Units (YPG) captured Koban√™ on 19 July 2012. Since July 2012, Koban√™ has been under Kurdish control, while the YPG and Kurdish politicians anticipate autonomy for the area, which they consider part of Rojava. After similar less intense events earlier in 2014, on 2 July the town and surrounding villages came under a massive attack from fighters of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. On 16 September, ISIL resumed its siege of Koban√™ with a full-scale assault from the west and the south of the city. The Koban√Æ Canton was attacked by ISIL militants for several months. In September 2014, ISIL militants occupied most of Koban√Æ Canton, seizing more than 100 Kurdish villages. As a consequence of the ISIL occupation, up to 200,000 Kurdish refugees fled from Koban√Æ Canton to Turkey. In the captured villages, ISIL militants committed massacres and kidnapped women. ISIL militants, however, were not able to occupy the entire canton, as the YPG and YPJ forces managed to defend the city of Koban√Æ and a few nearby settlements. After a few weeks of \\"neutrality\\", the US-led coalition began to target ISIL forces in Koban√Æ with a larger number of airstrikes, beginning on 5 October 2014. This move aided the YPG/YPJ in forcing ISIL to retreat from numerous parts of the city. The YPG reportedly forced ISIL to retreat from most of Koban√Æ on 26 January 2015, thus lifting the siege. On 27 January 2015, YPG-led fighters had retaken the entire city of Koban√Æ. Since then, the city was under YPG control. During May and June 2015, the YPG, FSA, and allied forces captured huge swaths of territory in northern Syria, taking territory across the western Al-Hasakah province and the Tell Abyad region, linking the Kurdish Jazira and Koban√Æ Cantons. Massacre The attack began on 25 June 2015, when fighters from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant detonated three car bombs in Koban√Æ, close to the Turkish border crossing. Kurdish forces and the Syrian government claimed the vehicles had entered the city from across the Turkish side of the border, an action denied by Turkey. An estimated force of 80‚Äì100 ISIL militants carried out the attack. ISIL fighters in five vehicles entered Kobani under cover of darkness in the early hours of Thursday, June 25, disguised themselves as Kurdish security forces, before infiltrating the city and shooting civilians with assault rifles and RPGs. ISIL also committed a massacre in the village of Barkh Butan, about 20 kilometres south of Koban√Æ, executing at least 23 Syrian Kurds, among them women and children. A Kurdish spokesman told the media on the next day that the militants were still pinned in three locations in the city of Kobani, including a field hospital. More than 100 hostages were reported being held by ISIL fighters or were trapped due to the crossfire. The battle in Koban√Æ city continued to rage for another 3 days, during which most of the ISIL attackers were killed, with 1 militant captured by the YPG, and only 7 escaping to Turkey. During the afternoon of 29 June, the last remaining ISIL militant in Koban√Æ city was shot and killed. Casualties Over 164 people were initially reported dead and 200 injured, making the attack one of the largest killings of civilians in the North of Syria. The final death toll of the attack was 223+ civilians, with over 300 injured. Responses ‚Äì Redur Xelil, the spokesman of the People's Protection Units (YPG), said that \\"Daesh (Isis) is carrying out a collective suicide attack, not to control Kobani or occupy it, but to kill the largest possible number of civilians\\". ‚Äì according to CNN Turk news channel, Erdogan told a business group at a Ramadan-fast-breaking dinner that \\"No one has the right to portray Turkey as being on the same line as terrorism... after these reprehensible attacks, we see that circles close to the separatist organization, in other words, the political party, have undertaken a slanderous defamation campaign that knows no principles, morality nor bounds that targets our nation,\\" referring to the HDP accusations. *Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey) ‚Äì \\"The Turkish government has supported ISIL for years.

Yamada as addressing rape in Deuteronomy ,Yamada (2008), p. 22 presenting three distinct laws on the issue. The passage is as follows: Yamada opines that Deuteronomy 22:23-24, which commands punishment for the woman if the act takes place in the city, was not about rape, but adultery, because the woman was already considered to be the reserved property of a future husband. He also argued that although the laws treat women as property, \\"the Deuteronomic laws, even if they do not address the crime of rape as sexual violence against a woman as such, do provide a less violent alternative for addressing the situation.Yamada (2008), pp. 22-24  Deuteronomy in historical biblical authorities  Many modern translations interpret Deuteronomy 22:28-29 as referring to a case of rape.  Other instances  There are several other passages in the Old Testament, including Genesis 34, Numbers 31:15-18, Deuteronomy 21:10-14, Judges 19:22-26, and 2 Samuel 13:1-14, which depict rape or have been interpreted as discussing rape by numerous scholars, including Wil Gafney and Phyllis Trible.Trible (1984), p. 5 In Genesis 34, Dinah is abducted by Shechem in a passage that is often interpreted as rape.Rapoport (2011), page 94 In Numbers 31:15-18, Moses, after exacting revenge on the Midianites, commands his army to kill all the boys and every non-virgin woman while telling them to \\"save for [themselves]\\" every virgin woman,\\" a phrase which has been interpreted as a passage depicting rape. Judges 19:22-26 depicts Gibeah and the Levite Concubine, in which a man sends out his concubine to a group of angry men, where they gang rape her.Title = Power and Marginality in the Abraham Narrative (Second Edition)  Author = Hemchand Gossai  Pub = Pickwick Publications  pg = 79 Afterwards, the man cuts up the body of his concubine into twelve pieces and sends them to the Twelve Tribes of Israel. 2 Samuel 13:1-14 involves the rape of Tamar.Trible (1984), pp. 37-38  Analysis In The Bible Now, Richard Elliott Friedman and Shawna Dolansky write \\"What should not be in doubt is the biblical view of rape: it is horrid. It is decried in the Bible's stories. It is not tolerated in the Bible's laws.\\"  Genesis  = Genesis 19 = Jan Wellens de Cock, Lot and his daughters. Genesis 19 features an attempted gang rape. Two angels arrive in Sodom, and Lot shows them hospitality. However, the men of the city gathered around Lot's house and demanded that he give them the two guests so that they could rape them. In response to this, Lot offers the mob his two virgin daughters instead. The mob refuses Lot's offer, but the angels strike them with blindness, and Lot and his family escape. Genesis 19 goes on to relate how Lot's daughters get him drunk and have sex with him. A number of commentators describe their actions as rape. Esther Fuchs suggests that the text presents Lot's daughters as the \\"initiators and perpetrators of the incestuous 'rape'.\\" Gerda Lerner has suggested that because the Hebrew Bible takes for granted Lot's right to offer his daughters for rape, we can assume that it reflected a historical reality of a father's power over them. = Genesis 34 = Shechem's rape of Dinah in Genesis 34 is described in the text itself as \\"a thing that should not be done.\\" Sandra E. Rapoport argues that \\"The Bible text is sympathetic to Shechem in the verses following his rape of Dinah, at the same time that it does not flinch from condemning the lawless predatory behavior towards her. One midrash even attributes Shechem's three languages of love in verse 3 to God's love for the Children of Israel.\\"Rapoport, pp. 103-104 She also put forth that \\"Shechem's character is complex. He is not easily characterized as unqualifiedly evil. It is this complexity that creates unbearable tension for the reader and raises the justifiably strong emotions of outrage, anger, and possible compassion.\\"Rapoport, p. 104 Susanne Scholz writes that \\"The brothers' revenge, however, also demonstrates their conflicting views about women. On the one hand they defend their sister. On the other hand they do not hesitate to capture other women as if these women were their booty. The connection of the rape and the resulting revenge clarifies that no easy solutions are available to stop rapists and rape-prone behavior. In this regard Genesis 34 invites contemporary readers to address the prevalence of rape through the metaphoric language of a story.\\"Scholz (2000), pp. 168-169 In a different work, Scholz writes that \\"During its extensive history of interpretation, Jewish and Christian interpreters mainly ignored Dinah. [‚Ä¶] in many interpretations, the fraternal killing is the criminal moment, and in more recent years scholars have argued explicitly against the possibility that Shechem rapes Dinah. They maintain that Shechem's love and marriage proposal do not match the 'scientifically documented behavior of a rapist'.\\"Scholz (2010), pp. 32-33 Mary Anna Bader notes the division between verses 2 and 3, and writes that \\"It is strange and upsetting for the modern reader to find the verbs 'love' and 'dishonor' together, having the same man as their subject and the same woman as their object.\\"Bader (2006), p. 91 Later, she writes that \\"The narrator gives the reader no information about Dinah's thoughts or feelings or her reactions to what has taken place. Shechem is not only the focalizor but also the primary actor‚Ä¶The narrator leaves no room for doubt that Shechem is the center of these verses. Dinah is the object (or indirect object) of Shechem's actions and desires.\\"Bader (2006), p. 92 Shechem seizes Dinah Sandra E. Rapoport regards Genesis 34 as condemning rape strongly, writing, \\"The brothers' revenge killings of Shechem and Hamor, while they might remind modern readers of frontier justice and vigilantism, are an understandable measure-for-measure act in the context of the ancient Near East.Rapoport (2011), pp. 127-128 Scholz argued that \\"The literary analysis showed, however, that despite this silence Dinah is present throughout the story. Indeed, everything happens because of her. Informed by feminist scholarship, the reading does not even require her explicit comments.\\"Scholz (2000), p. 168 Frank M. Yamada argues that the abrupt transition between Genesis 34:2 and 34:3 was a storytelling technique due to the fact that the narrative focused on the men, a pattern which he perceives in other rape narratives as well, also arguing that the men's responses are depicted in a mixed light. \\"The rape of Dinah is narrated in a way that suggests there are social forces at work, which complicate the initial seal violation and will make problematic the resulting male responses. [‚Ä¶] The abrupt transition from rape to marriage, however, creates a tension in the reader's mind‚Ä¶the unresolved issue of punishment anticipates the response of Simeon and Levi.\\"Yamada (2008), p. 45  Genesis 39  In Genesis 39, a rare Biblical instance of sexual harassment and assault perpetrated against a man by a woman can be found. In this chapter, the enslaved Joseph endures repeated verbal sexual harassment from the wife of his master Potiphar. Joseph refuses to have sex with her, as he has no right to do so and it would be a sin against God (Genesis 39:6-10). Potiphar's wife eventually physically assaults him, demanding that he come to bed with her and grabbing at his clothing (Genesis 39:12). Joseph escapes, leaving the article of clothing with her (different translations describe the article of clothing as, for example, Joseph's \\"garment,\\" \\"robe,\\" \\"coat,\\" or even simply \\"clothes\\"). Potiphar's wife then tells first her servants, and then her husband, that Joseph had attacked her (Genesis 39:13-18). Joseph is sent to prison (Genesis 39:19-20), where he remains until his God-given ability to interpret dreams leads the Pharaoh to ask for his help (Genesis 41:14).  Numbers 31  :\\"\\"Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the people went to meet them outside the camp. But Moses was furious with all the military commanders who had returned from the battle. ‚ÄúWhy have you let all the women live?‚Äù he demanded. ‚ÄúThese are the very ones who followed Balaam‚Äôs advice and caused the people of Israel to rebel against the LORD at Mount Peor. They are the ones who caused the plague to strike the LORD‚Äôs people. Now kill all the boys and all the women who have slept with a man. Only the young girls who are virgins may live; you may keep them for yourselves.\\"  Deuteronomy  =Deuteronomy 2021= Deuteronomy 20:14 indicates that all women and child captives become enslaved property: Deuteronomy 21:1014 states: This passage is grouped with laws concerning sons and inheritance, suggesting that the passage's main concern is with the regulation of marriage in such a way as to transform the woman taken captive in war into an acceptable Israelite wife, in order to beget legitimate Israelite children. Caryn Reeder notes, \\"The month-long delay before the finalization of the marriage would thus act in part as a primitive pregnancy test.\\" It The idea that the captive woman will be raped is supported by the fact that in passages like Isaiah 13:16 and Zechariah 14:2, sieges lead to women being \\"ravished\\". M.I. Rey notes that the passage \\"conveniently provides a divorce clause to dispose of her (when she is no longer sexually gratifying) without providing her food or shelter or returning her to her family. . . . In this way, the foreign captive is divorced not for objectionable actions like other (Israelite/Hebrew) wives but for reasons beyond her control.\\" David Resnick praises the passage for its nobility, calling it \\"evidently the first legislation in human history to protect women prisoners of war\\" and \\"the best of universalist Biblical humanism as it seeks to manage a worst case scenario: controlling how a conquering male must act towards a desired, conquered, female other.\\" He argues that after the defeat of her nation in war, marrying the victors \\"may be the best way for a woman to advance her own interests in a calamitous political and social situation.\\" By treating her as a wife, rather than as a slave, the law seeks to compensate for the soldier's having \\"violated her\\" by his failure to procure her father's approval, which was precluded by the state of war. =Deuteronomy 22= Deuteronomy 22:22 states: This passage does not specifically address the wife's complicity, and therefore one interpretation is that even if she was raped, she must be put to death since she has been defiled by the extramarital encounter. Deuteronomy 22:25-27 states: Deuteronomy 22:28-29 states: Tarico was critical of Deuteronomy 22:28-29, saying that \\"The punishments for rape have to do not with compassion or trauma to the woman herself but with honor, tribal purity, and a sense that a used woman is damaged goods.\\" Exodus 22:16-17, while not explicitly mentioning sexual assault, is similar to this verse. It mentions how the father of the woman can turn down this offer of marriage. Cheryl Anderson, in her book Ancient Laws and Contemporary Controversies: The Need for Inclusive Bible Interpretation, discusses an anecdote about a student, who, when exposed to the passages in Deuteronomy, said that \\"This is the word of God. If it says slavery is okay, slavery is okay. If it says rape is okay, rape is okay.\\"Anderson (2009), p. 3 Elaborating on this, she states in response to these passages, \\"Clearly, these laws do not take into account the female's perspective. After a rape, [the victim] would undoubtedly see herself as the injured party and would probably find marriage to her rapist to be distasteful, to say the least. Arguably, there are cultural and historical reasons why such a law made sense at the time. [‚Ä¶] Just the same, the law communicates the message that faith tradition does not (and should not) consider the possibility that women might have different yet valid perspectives.\\"Anderson (2009), p. 3-4 Richard M. Davidson regarded Deuteronomy 22:28-29 as a law concerning statutory rape. He argued that the laws do support the role of women in the situation, writing, \\"even though the woman apparently consents to engage in sexual intercourse with the man in these situations, the man nonetheless has 'afflicted/humbled/violated her'. The Edenic divine design that a woman's purity be respected and protected has been violated. [‚Ä¶] Even though the woman may have acquiesced to her seducer, nonetheless according to the law, the dowry is 'equal to the bride wealth for virgins' (Exodus 22:16): she is treated financially as a virgin would be! Such treatment upholds the value of a woman against a man taking unfair advantage of her, and at the same time discourages sexual abuse.\\" Regarding 22:25-27, Craig S. Keener noted that \\"biblical law assumes [the woman's] innocence without requiring witnesses; she does not bear the burden of proof to argue that she did not consent. If the woman might have been innocent, her innocence must be assumed,\\" while Davidson added, \\"Thus the Mosaic law protects the sexual purity of a betrothed woman (and protects the one to whom she is betrothed), and prescribing the severest penalty to the man who dares to sexually violate her.\\" Robert S. Kawashima notes that regardless of whether the rape of a girl occurs in the country or the city, she \\"can be guilty of a crime, but not, technically speaking, a victim of a crime, for which reason her noncomplicity does not add to the perpetrator's guilt.\\"  Judges  The Levite finds his concubine dead on his doorstep. Art by Gustave Dor√©. Trible devotes a chapter in Texts of Terror to the rape of the concubine in the Book of Judges, titled \\"An Unnamed Woman: The Extravagance of Violence\\". About the rape of the concubine itself, she wrote, \\"The crime itself receives few words. If the storyteller advocates neither pornography or sensationalism, he also cares little about the women's fate. The brevity of this section on female rape contrasts sharply with the lengthy reports on male carousing and male deliberations that precede it. Such elaborate attention to men intensifies the terror perpetrated upon the woman.\\"Trible (1984), p. 56 After noting that differences in the Greek and Hebrew versions of the Bible make it unclear whether or not the concubine was dead the following morning (\\"the narrator protects his protagonist through ambiguity\\"),Trible (1984), pp. 59-60 Trible writes that \\"Neither the other characters nor the narrator recognizes her humanity. She is property, object, tool, and literary device. [..] In the end, she is no more than the oxen that Saul will later cut in pieces and send throughout all the territory of Israel as a call to war.\\"Trible (1984), p. 61 Scholz notes the linguistic ambiguity of the passage and the variety of interpretations that stem from it. She wrote that \\"since this narrative is not a 'historical' or 'accurate' report about actual events, the answers to these questions reveal more about a reader's assumptions regarding gender, androcentrism, and sociopolitical practices than can be known about ancient Israelite life based on Judges 19. [‚Ä¶] Predictably, interpreters deal differently with the meaning of the story, depending on their hermeneutical interests.\\"Scholz (2010), pp. 139-144 Yamada believes that the language used to describe the plight of the concubine make the reader sympathize with her, especially during the rape and its aftermath. \\"Thus, the narrator's elaborate description of the woman's attempt to return to the old man's house highlights for the reader the devastating effects of the preceding night's events, emphasizing her desolate state. The woman's raped and exhausted body becomes a symbol of the wrong that is committed when 'every man did what was right in his own eyes.' The image of this woman struggling to the door demands a response from the participants in the story.\\"Yamada (2008), p. 90  2 Samuel  = 2 Samuel 11 = Some scholars see the episode of David's adultery with Bathsheba in 2 Samuel 11 as an account of a rape. David and Diana Garland suggest that: > Since consent was impossible, given her powerless position, David in essence > raped her. Rape means to have sex against the will, without the consent, of > another ‚Äì and she did not have the power to consent. Even if there was no > physical struggle, even if she gave in to him, it was rape. Other scholars, however, suggest that Bathsheba came to David willingly. James B. Jordan notes that the text does not describe Bathsheba's protest, as it does Tamar's in 2 Samuel 13, and argues that this silence indicates that \\"Bathsheba willingly cooperated with David in adultery.\\" George Nicol goes even further and suggests that \\"Bathsheba's action of bathing in such close proximity to the royal palace was deliberately provocative.\\" = 2 Samuel 13 = Amnon and Tamar, unknown artist In 2 Samuel 13, Tamar asks her half- brother Amnon not to rape her, saying, \\"I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.\\" Kawashima notes that \\"one might interpret her remarkably articulate response as mere rhetoric, an attempt to forestall the impending assault, but the principle of verisimilitude still suggests that David, as patriarch of the house, is the legal entity who matters\\" when it comes to consenting to his daughter's union with Amnon. When, after the rape, Amnon tells Tamar to leave, she says, \\"There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me\\", indicating her expectation, in accordance with the conventions of the time, is to remain in his house as his wife. In The Cry of Tamar: Violence Against Women and the Church's Response, Pamela Cooper-White criticizes the Bible's depiction of Tamar for its emphasis on the male roles in the story and the perceived lack of sympathy given to Tamar. \\"The narrator of 2 Samuel 13 at times portrays poignantly, eliciting our sympathy for the female victim. But mostly, the narrator (I assume he) steers us in the direction of primary interest, even sympathy, for the men all around her. Even the poignancy of Tamar's humiliation is drawn out for the primary purpose of justifying Absalom's later murder of Amnon and not for its own sake.\\"Cooper-White (1995), p. 29 She opined that \\"Sympathy for Tamar is not the narrator's primary interest. The forcefulness of Tamar's impression is drawn out, not to illuminate her pain, but to justify Absalom's anger at Amnon and subsequent murder of him.\\"Cooper- White (1995), p. 30 Cooper-White also states that after the incestuous rape, the narrative continues to focus on Amnon, writing, \\"The story continues to report the perpetrator's viewpoint, the thoughts and feelings after the incident of violence; the victim's viewpoint is not presented. [‚Ä¶] We are given no indication that he ever thought about her again‚Äîeven in terms of fear of punishment or reprisal.\\"Cooper-White (1995), p. 31 Trible allocates another chapter in Texts of Terror to Tamar, subtitled \\"The Royal Rape of Wisdom.\\" She noted that Tamar is the lone female in the narrative and is treated as part of the stories of Amnon and Absalom. \\"Two males surround a female. As the story unfolds, they move between protecting and polluting, supporting and seducing, comforting and capturing her. Further, these sons of David compete with each other through the beautiful woman.\\"Trible (1984), p. 26 She also wrote that the language the original Hebrew uses to describe the rape is better translated as \\"He laid her\\" than \\"He lay with her.\\"Trible (1984), p. 34 Scholz wrote that \\"Many scholars make a point of rejecting the brutality with which Amnon subdues his [half-]sister,\\" going on to criticize an interpretation by Pamela Tamarkin Reis that blames Tamar, rather than Amnon, for what happened to her.Scholz (2010), p. 39 Regarding the rape of Tamar in 2 Samuel, Rapoport states that \\"Amnon is an unmitigatedly detestable figure. Literarily, he is the evil foil to Tamar's courageous innocence. [‚Ä¶] The Bible wants the reader to simultaneously appreciate, mourn, and cheer for Tamar as we revile and despise Amnon.\\"Rapoport (2011), p. 352 Regarding the same passage, Bader wrote that \\"Tamar's perception of the situation is given credibility; indeed Amnon's lying with her proved to be violating her. Simultaneously with increasing Tamar's credibility, the narrator discredits Amnon.\\"Bader (2006), p. 147 Trible opined that \\"[Tamar's] words are honest and poignant; they acknowledge female servitude.\\"Trible (1984), p. 33 She also writes that \\"the narrator hints at her powerlessness by avoiding her name.\\" Similarly, Yamada argues that the narrator aligns with Tamar and makes the reader sympathize with her. \\"The combination of Tamar's pleas with Amnon's hatred of his half-sister after the violation aligns the reader with the victim and produce scorn toward the perpetrator. The detailed narration of the rape and post-rape responses of the two characters makes this crime more deplorable.\\"Yamada (2008), p. 114  Prophetic books  Both Kate Blanchard and Scholz note that there are several passages in the Book of Isaiah, Book of Jeremiah, and Book of Ezekiel that utilize rape metaphors.Scholz (2010), p. 181 Blanchard expressed outrage over this fact, writing \\"The translations of these shining examples of victim- blaming are clear enough, despite the old-fashioned language: I'm angry and you're going to suffer for it. You deserve to be raped because of your sexual exploits. You're a slut and it was just a matter of time till you suffered the consequences. Let this be a lesson to you and to all other uppity women.\\" Scholz discussed four passages‚ÄîIsaiah 3:16-17, Jeremiah 13:22 and 26, Ezekiel 16, and Ezekiel 23.Scholz (2010), p. 182 On Isaiah, Scholz wrote that there is a common mistranslation of the Hebrew word p≈çt as \\"forehead\\" or \\"scalp\\". Also often translated as \\"genitals\\", Scholz believes that a more accurate translation of the word in context is \\"cunt\\".Scholz (2010), p. 182-183 Regarding Jeremiah, Scholz wrote, \\"The poem proclaims that the woman brought this fate upon herself and she is to be blamed for it, while the prophet sides with the sexually violent perpetrators, viewing the attack as deserved and God as justifying it. Rape poetics endorses 'masculine authoritarianism' and the 'dehumanization of women,' perhaps especially when the subject is God.\\"Scholz (2010), p. 184 Scholz refers to both passages in Ezekiel as \\"pornographic objectification of Jerusalem.\\"Scholz (2010), p. 188 On Ezekiel 16, she wrote, \\"These violent words obscure the perspective of the woman, and the accusations are presented solely through the eyes of the accuser, Yahweh. God speaks, accuses his wife of adultery, and prescribes the punishment in the form of public stripping, violation, and killing. In the prophetic imagination, the woman is not given an opportunity to reply. [‚Ä¶] God expresses satisfaction of her being thus punished.\\" Regarding Ezekiel 23, a story about two adulterous sisters who are eventually killed, she decries the language used in the passage, especially Ezekiel 23:48, which serves as a warning to all women about adultery. \\"The prophetic rape metaphor turns the tortured, raped, and murdered wives into a warning sign for all women. It teaches that women better obey their husbands, stay in their houses, and forgo any signs of sexual independence. [‚Ä¶] This prophetic fantasy constructs women as objects, never as subjects, and it reduces women to sexualized objects who bring God's punishment upon themselves and fully deserve it.Scholz (2010), p. 191 Amy Kalmanofsky opined that Jeremiah 13 treats the naked female body as an object of disgust: \\"I conclude that Jer 13 is an example of obscene nudity in which the naked female body is displayed not as an object of desire, but of disgust. In Jer 13, as in the other prophetic texts, Israel is not sexually excited by having her nakedness exposed. She is shamed. Moreover, those who witness Israel's shame do not desire Israel's exposed body. They are disgusted by it.\\" Conversely, Corrine Patton argued that \\"this text does not support domestic abuse; and scholars, teachers, and preachers must continue to remind uninformed readers that such an interpretation is actually a misreading\\" and that \\"the theological aim of the passage is to save Yahweh from the scandal of being a cuckolded husband, i.e. a defeated, powerless, and ineffective god. [‚Ä¶] It is a view of God for whom no experience, not even rape and mutilation in wartime, is beyond hope for healing and redemption.\\" Regarding Ezekiel 16, Daniel I. Block wrote that \\"the backdrop of divine judgment can be appreciated only against the backdrop of his grace. If the text had begun at v. 36 one might understandably had accused God of cruelty and undue severity. But the zeal of his anger is a reflex of the intensity of his love. God had poured out his love on this woman, rescuing her from certain death, entering into covenant relationship with her, pledging his troth, lavishing on her all the benefits she could enjoy. He had loved intensely. He could not take contempt for his grace lightly.\\" F. B. Huey, Jr., commenting on Jeremiah, wrote, \\"The crude description is that of the public humiliation inflicted on a harlot, an appropriate figure for faithless Judah. It could also describe the violence done to women by soldiers of a conquering army. [‚Ä¶] Jeremiah reminded [Israel] that they were going to be exposed for all to see their adulteries.\\"  See also  *Marry-your-rapist law#Antiquity until 1900 *Susanna, a biblical figure subjected to sexual harassment  References  ;Works cited   Sexuality in the Bible Biblical law Bible- related controversies Christianity and women Judaism and women Rape Hebrew Bible topics ","title":"Rape in the Hebrew Bible"},{"id":"47089795","text":"DD Manipur is a state owned TV channel telecasting from Doordarshan.

He graduated from Phillips Academy in 1817 and Yale College in 1821. He began the study of theology at Andover Seminary in 1822, but in 1824 transferred himself to New Haven and finished his studies with the first class which received instruction in the Theological Department of Yale College. He was also for nearly two years, from 1824 to 1826, a tutor in the college. He was ordained at Springfield, Mass, May 10, 1826, as a missionary, and in the following September embarked for the East, under the direction of the Boston Female Society for the promotion of Christianity among the Jews. He spent about two years in laboring in Smyrna and Istanbul, and then returned to the U. S.

He was widely known for portraying prominent historical scientists during some of his lectures; dressing in costume and speaking in character to entertain and inform his students. A 1953 Guggenheim fellow, he wrote several books and more than 200 scientific papers. His research focused on eyes and vision in animals, especially the parietal eye or \\"third eye\\" of vertebrates, as well as animal embryology. He served as chairman of the UC Berkeley Department of Zoology for over 10 years, was elected president of the Western Society of Naturalists and American Society of Zoologists, and was a fellow of the California Academy of Sciences. Eakin was born in Florence, Colorado, and grew up in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He initially studied at the University of Tulsa, planning a career in the clergy, before switching to zoology, earning a bachelor's degree and doctorate at UC Berkeley. After postdoctoral studies in Germany under Hans Spemann he returned to UC Berkeley as a faculty member, where he would teach for over 40 years, earning awards and recognition for his teaching before retiring with highest faculty honors. Early life and education (1910‚Äì1936) Richard Eakin was born on May 5, 1910, in Florence, Colorado, to parents Marshall and Mary Elizabeth Eakin. He attended high school in Tulsa, Oklahoma, graduating in 1927. He initially planned to go into the clergy, enrolling in the University of Tulsa and studying subjects such as theology and Greek for two years, before deciding to pursue zoology. In 1929, Eakin moved to Berkeley, California to attend UC Berkeley. He earned his A.B. in 1931, then enrolled in graduate school under J. Franklin Daniel, an ichthyologist and embryologist. For his dissertation, Eakin studied the development of salamander and frog embryos, earning a PhD in zoology in 1935. From 1935 to 1936 he worked in Germany as a postdoctoral scholar in the laboratories of embryologists and Nobel laureate Hans Spemann. On August 8, 1935, Eakin married Mary Mulford, daughter of Walter Mulford, a Berkeley professor of forestry. Career (1936‚Äì1977) Upon his return to UC Berkeley in 1936, Eakin was appointed instructor of zoology, becoming assistant professor in 1940 and full professor in 1949. He was assistant dean of the College of Letters and Science from 1940 to 1943, and chairman of the Department of Zoology from 1942 to 1948, and again from 1952 to 1957. As an administrator he helped found the university's Bodega Marine Laboratory, Sagehen Creek Field Station, and Cancer Research Genetics Laboratory. In 1956 he published a history of zoological research at Berkeley spanning the period from the university's 1868 founding through 1956, followed by a 1988 companion article covering the intervening 32 years. Research The third eye (frontal organ) of a frog, seen between the regular eyes. Eakin was known for his research of animal eyes and photoreceptor cells, especially the parietal eye (the so-called \\"third eye\\") and associated pineal gland of vertebrates. He was persuaded to study the parietal eyes of reptiles by his colleague Robert C. Stebbins, and the two published several articles on the parietal eye of western fence lizards. Eakin, alone or with colleagues, published many other papers on the anatomy and function of reptilian parietal eyes and similar structures in amphibians. Eakin's 1973 monograph, The Third Eye, was received as comprehensive and detailed enough for biologists, yet in a style approachable to non-scientists or undergraduates. He also studied amphibian development and was recognized as a skilled and early practitioner of electron microscopy. Eakin received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1953, and the Boston Museum of Science's Walker Prize in 1976. He authored or co-authored over 200 scientific papers, was elected president of the Western Society of Naturalists in 1949 and American Society of Zoologists in 1975, and was a fellow of the California Academy of Sciences for 52 years. \\"Great scientists speak again\\" In 1970, in order to combat boredom and absenteeism in his introductory zoology course, Eakin gave his first lecture in character, appearing unannounced in full costume and makeup as William Harvey, the 17th- century physician who made the first complete descriptions of blood circulation. His portrayals of historic scientists, including Charles Darwin, Louis Pasteur, and Gregor Mendel, often involved elaborate wigs, makeup, costumes, and props, aided by professional makeup artists and drama teachers- his portrayal of Darwin required up to three hours of makeup, wig, and beard preparation. His lectures were popular with students from the start and attracted international attention, with profiles in publications such as LIFE, Der Spiegel, and the International Herald Tribune. He gave guest lectures at universities nationwide, and in 1975 compiled the text of his lectures, along with photographs, diagrams, and stage directions, into a book, Great Scientists Speak Again. Eakin typically gave six lectures in character during a course, with each \\"guest lecturer\\" introducing particular concepts. The figures portrayed, in order of appearance during a typical course, were: *William Harvey (1578‚Äì1657) *William Beaumont (1785‚Äì1853) *Hans Spemann (1869‚Äì1941) *Gregor Mendel (1822‚Äì1884) *Louis Pasteur (1822‚Äì1895) *Charles Darwin (1809‚Äì1882) Eakin considered his impersonation of Spemann to be his most authoritative, due to knowing him personally from working in his lab in Germany, helping translate a book of his into English, and becoming good friends. Eakin was recognized for his teaching long before he first donned a wig: in 1963 he was the first recipient of Berkeley's Senior Citation for Distinguished Teaching and in 1968 received the Outstanding Teaching Award from the Associated Students of the University of California. Later years (1977‚Äì1999) Eakin retired in 1977 and was honored with the Berkeley Citation, the highest honor given to Berkeley faculty. He continued to periodically perform his lectures in character until 1988, and also taught embryology at several historically black colleges and universities in the southern U.S., including Tougaloo College, Mississippi; Talladega College and Tuskegee University, Alabama; and Fisk University in Tennessee. Eakin was a member of the First Congregational Church of Berkeley for over 60 years, where his first wife, Mary Mulford Eakin ‚Äì ordained by the United Church of Christ ‚Äì was associate minister. He co-authored a history of the church in 1999. In a 1981 interview, Eakin stressed that matters of faith and science should be kept separate ‚Äì as he did in his own life as both a Christian and a scientist ‚Äì and that proponents of teaching creationism alongside evolution in public schools should similarly recognize the differences. \\"The great concepts of justice, mercy and love- science cannot test them or write a formula\\", he said, \\"They are human beliefs and are outside the realm of science.\\" His first wife Mary, with whom he had three children (one of whom died prior to 1956), died in 1980. He later remarried Barbara Nichols, a former professor at the University of California, San Francisco. Eakin died on November 25, 1999, at his home in Danville, California, at the age of 89. He was survived by his wife Barbara, a son and daughter from his first marriage, and two stepdaughters. Books  (with James M.

History On the abbey site in 1127 a priory was founded by Affligem Abbey, to whom Godfrey I of Louvain had given the land on the Vlierbeek two years previously. In 1163 or 1165 the priory was elevated to the status of an abbey. The Benedictines cultivated the surrounding land, and played a great role in the spiritual and intellectual development of the area. Over the next few centuries they worked almost constantly on the abbey complex, having often to repair or rebuild what had been destroyed by fire or conflict. In 1170 a stone church in Romanesque style replaced the first church, which was made of clay. In 1572 the abbey was burnt down by the troops of William of Orange. The reconstruction of the abbey was spread over two periods. The first lasted from 1642 to c. 1730. The second, under the direction of Laurent-Beno√Æt Dewez, lasted from 1776 to 1796. During the occupation by the French Revolutionary army the abbey, like all other monasteries, was suppressed in 1796, and the monks were expelled. The buildings and contents were sold off in 1798. Jan Antoon de Becker of Louvain, brother of one of the monks, became the new owner. In 1801 the abbot and some of the monks returned, but a full revival of the community did not succeed, and the last monk of Vlierbeek died in 1838. After the creation of the municipality of Kessel-Lo in 1828 the abbey church became the parish church for the whole of it. In 1877 the parish of Blauwput was separated. In 1900 Boven-Lo also became an independent parish. From that point the former abbey church became the parish church of the parish of Vlierbeek. In 1830 de Becker donated the church to the churchwardens and in 1837 he made a further gift to them of the remaining abbey buildings. Some were demolished, others rented to individuals. Vlierbeek remained rural until World War II. After the war the population and construction increased rapidly and a school (the \\"abbey school\\") was built there. In early 1970 the province of Brabant bought the remaining rural area round the abbey in order to prevent the neighbourhood from being parcelled out in building plots. This area was expanded to form the Kessel-Lo province estate.ProvincieDomein Kessel-Lo For more than 60 years Chiro Vlierbeek, a Catholic youth group, has used the abbey buildings.Chiro Vlierbeek Abbey church The Neo-classical abbey church was designed by the well-known architect Laurent-Beno√Æt Dewez (1731-1812). The central part is octagonal and is crowned by a cupola. The openings have various geometric forms such as semi-circle or a trapezium. The interior is severe and light. The monks' choir terminates in a square tower with an octagonal skylight. Churchyard In the churchyard are burial monuments of prominent persons, including the professors Alberdingk-Thijm (1827-1904), Emiel Vliebergh (1872-1925), Mgr. Pieter-Jozef Sencie (1865-1941) and student leader Jef Vanden Eynde (1879-1929). Visits Every weekend a mass is celebrated in the church. Apart from this the church is accessible to visitors, and the abbot's lodgings are accessible on special occasions. The other buildings are private property.

File:Figner Alexandr Samoilovich.jpg Aleksandr Samoilovich Figner (Alexandre Figner, ) (1787‚Äî1813) was a Guards colonel of the army of the Russian Empire, known as the organizer of partisan units during the 1812 Napoleonic invasion of Russia and later of Germany. After the Russian army left Moscow after the battle of Borodino, he received permission to act independently as a partisan. He entered the city and committed sabotage there. According to some stories, he even planned to kill Napoleon. After that, he gathered a detachment of lagging soldiers and deserters and began to attack the retreating units of the Grande Arm√©e. His detachment became a notable force and participated in the capture of the General Augereau brigade near Lyakhovo. Figner managed to create a resounding glory for himself, becoming the most famous partisan leader at that time. He was distinguished by a passion for dressing up for reconnaissance among enemy units. During the War of the Sixth Coalition, he was sent to Danzig for espionage and agitation among the local population. He was distinguished by cruelty towards captured French, unusual even among the partisans of that time. Another famous partisan, Denis Davydov, severely criticized him for this. Figner often gave prisoners to the peasants for laceration and liked to kill prisoners himself with his favorite air gun. But he tried to use captured Spaniards and Italians for his own purposes. During the Truce of Pl√§switz he formed from them the so- called \\"Vengeful Legion\\" with the help of which he hoped to overthrow the king of Italy or Westphalia. After the retreating of the main forces he tried to wage his own war in Westphalia (he hoped to provoke an uprising of the local population against the French). But he was defeated, and the units recruited from the prisoners showed themselves poorly. He came to his death swimming over the Elbe, while trying to break an encirclement by Napoleonic troops at Dessau. It is believed that he could be one of the prototypes of Fedor Dolokhov, a partisan leader in Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace, although the count Fyodor Ivanovich Tolstoy, also known as the \\"American\\", is considered a more likely candidate.

Son of Richard and Joanna (Prindle) Peet, was born in Bethlehem, Connecticut, Nov. 19th, 1794. He began to teach a district school at the age of 16, and persevered until he had earned money enough for a two years' course at Phillips Academy, Andover. He graduated from Yale College in 1822. On leaving college his intention was to devote his life to the Christian ministry, but an invitation to teach in the American Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb, at Hartford, Conn., gave him the opportunity to discover and develop his rare fitness for what was then a new profession. His life was thenceforwards devoted to the cause of deaf-mute education. For nearly nine years he continued in Hartford, and was then appointed Principal of the N. Y. Institution for the Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb, in New York City. Entering on this office in Feb., 1831, he fulfilled its duties for more than thirty-six years, for fourteen of them being President of the Board of Directors. The degree of LL.D. was conferred on him in 1849 by the Regents of the University of the State of New York, and that of PhD. by the National Deaf-mute College in 1871. Under his care the N Y. Institution rose to be much the largest of its kind in the world, and one of the most successful. He published a series of elementary text-books for the use of deaf-mutes, and wrote numerous papers on deaf-mute education and kindred topics. In 1867, Dr. Peet retired from the active labors of his position, retaining the title of Emeritus Principal, and serving as one of the Board of Directors until his death. For the last few years of his life he suffered from rheumatic affections, which finally reaching the region of the heart induced congestion of the lungs. He died within two hours after the opening of the New Year, 1873. Dr. Peet married three times. His first wife, Margaret Maria Lewis, daughter of Rev. Isaac Lewis, D.D., to whom he was married Nov. 27th, 1823, died Sept. 23d, 1832, leaving three sons, who became able and accomplished teachers of the deaf and dumb. The two younger, Edward and Dudley (the latter a graduate of Yale in 1852), died in 1862 ; and the eldest (Yale, 1845) has succeeded to his father's office. Dr. Peet married, in 1835, Miss Sarah Ann Smith, a daughter of Matson Smith, M.D., who died Dec. 30th, 1864. His third wife, Mrs. Louisa P. Hotchkiss, to whom he was married Jan. 15th, 1868, survived him. The number of the American Annals of the Deaf and Dumb for April, 1873, is a memorial of his life and services.

I. planus can only be found in marine deposits on the Pacific Rim, especially the west coast of the United States.Yabumoto, Y. and Uyeno, T. (1994), Late Mesozoic and Cenozoic fish faunas of Japan. Island Arc, 3: 255‚Äì269. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1738.1994.tb00115.x Teeth belonging to I. planus can reach lengths of 2.0 in (5.0 cm), and are often found in the Temblor Formation of Bakersfield, California.Malchow, A. 2009. MIOCENE SHARK TOOTH HILL LOCALITY, KERN COUNTY, CALIFORNIA. Geological Society of America North- Central Section - 43rd Annual Meeting (2-3 April 2009) Description Isurus planus exists only around the Pacific Rim areas, including Australia, Japan, the eastern coast of Russia, Oregon, California, and Mexico, while being most common in Southern California, especially at Sharktooth Hill near Bakersfield, California. With teeth up to two inches long, I. planus would probably be around the size of a modern great white shark and most likely preyed upon the fish, pinnipeds, and smaller cetaceans of its time. Teeth Isurus planus teeth are somewhat similar to those of other mako sharks, especially the extinct species Cosmopolitodus hastalis and Isurus desori. Adult upper teeth are generally 2‚Äì4 cm long with an unserrated cutting edge and no lateral cusplets. True to its name, each tooth is \\"hooked\\", the point of which is shifted away from the middle axis, in the direction of the corners of the mouth. In this, the teeth of I. planus and I. desori differ from C. hastalis. I. desori teeth are much more heterodonic than I. planus and their roots are more uneven in thickness and shape, with more narrow builds and rounder lobes, somewhat making the appearance of a heart. But the crowns of the lower teeth of this species are described to be more straight and identical to the lower teeth of C. hastalis.Ciampaglio, C., Ricketts,D. Miocene Madness: Fossil Finder ID and Information Guide. Bakersfield, California. Buena Vista Museum of Natural History. The hooked teeth, which probably would be efficient for gripping prey, would suggest a diet of smaller and medium-sized animals. Classification Isurus planus is believed to be descended from the narrow- form of the broad-tooth \\"mako\\" Cosmopolitodus hastalis,but the genus name Isurus may be invalid if this lineage is true, as C. hastalis is believed to be a breakaway from the original Isurus lineage. Therefore, the genus name of I. planus would actually be Cosmopolitodus or Carcharodon (a study by Ehret et al. (2012) suggested that C. hastalis may belong to the genus Carcharodon). However, this has never been addressed, and the original genus name Isurus has been retained. Note: the broad-form C. hastalis is labeled as C. xiphodon.

Financing Geothermal projects in Myanmar use an estimated break even power cost of 5.3-8.6 U.S cents/kWh or in Myanmar Kyat 53-86K per kWh. This pegs a non-fluctuating 1$=1000K, which is a main concern for power project funding. The main drawback with depreciation pressures, in the current FX market. Between June 2012 and October 2015, the Myanmar Kyat depreciated by approximately 35%, from 850 down to 1300 against the US Dollar. Local businesses with foreign denominated loans from abroad suddenly found themselves rushing for a strategy to mitigate currency risks. Myanmar‚Äôs current lack of available currency hedging solutions presents a real challenge for Geothermal project financing.  History  On 1 October 1951, Electricity Supply Board (ESB) was organized under the Ministry of Industry. On 16 March 1972, it was changed as Electric Power Corporation (EPC).

Initially a supporter of James Byrnes, he opposed Byrnes for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly seat of Parramatta in 1869. Unsuccessful on that occasion, he won election in 1872. Taylor immediately resigned as he had received conflicting legal advice as to whether his contract to supply articles to a destitute institution disqualified him from office. He was elected unopposed at the May 1872 by- election. He was re-elected in 1874, but resigned in 1876 after he was referred to the Committee of Elections and Qualification as to whether he had a contract with the government.

United States, 576 U.S. 591 (2015), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled the Residual Clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act was unconstitutionally vague and in violation of due process. Background Armed Career Criminal Act The Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) was a part of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 that was enacted to impose tougher sentences in illegal firearms cases on defendants who have previously been convicted three or more times for \\"violent\\" felonies. defined a \\"violent felony\\" as an act that threatens \\"use of physical force against the person of another,\\" \\"is burglary, arson, or extortion,\\" \\"involves use of explosives,\\" or \\"otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\\" The last part of this definition became known as the \\"residual clause.\\" Case History Samuel James Johnson was a lifelong criminal and active white supremacist who, starting in 2010, was monitored by the FBI due to his involvement in suspected terrorist groups. Over the years, he revealed to undercover agents his plans to carry out terrorist attacks, as well as his illegal supply of weapons. In 2012, he was indicted on multiple counts of being a felon in possession of firearms and ammunition. Johnson pleaded guilty to the weapons charges and was sentenced under the ACCA's residual clause to a statutory minimum of 15 years for having three prior \\"violent felony\\" convictions, one of which was possession of a sawed-off shotgun.Johnson v. United States, . Arguments Johnson's lawyers argued that mere possession of a sawed-off shotgun does not qualify as a \\"violent felony\\" as described under the residual clause. In 2013, an appeal to the Eighth Circuit upheld the decision by the District Court to sentence Johnson to 15 years in accordance to the ACCA.United States v. Johnson, The Supreme Court of the United States originally granted the case certiorari to decide if the state law banning possession of a sawed-off shot gun qualified as a \\"violent felony\\" under the residual clause. The case was initially argued on November 5, 2014, but the Court asked the parties to reconvene and directly address the question of whether or not the residual clause was unconstitutionally vague. The case was reargued on April 20, 2015. Opinions Majority Justice Scalia wrote the opinion of the Court, which determined the residual clause to be in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Scalia described the statute as a \\"failed enterprise\\" that invited \\"arbitrary enforcement.\\" He declared that individuals are unconstitutionally deprived of due process when they are convicted under \\"a criminal law so vague that it fails to give ordinary people fair notice of the conduct it punishes.\\" The Court had raised the specter of unconstitutional vagueness in two prior cases regarding the residual clause‚ÄîJames v. United States and Sykes v. United States‚Äîthat \\"honed in on the imprecision of the phrase 'serious potential risk'\\". However, \\"neither opinion evaluated the uncertainty introduced by the need to evaluate the riskiness of an abstract ordinary case of a crime.\\" Noting that \\"[d]ecisions under the residual clause have proved to be anything but evenhanded, predictable, or consistent\\", the Court decided that \\"[s]tanding by James and Sykes would undermine, rather than promote, the goals that stare decisis is meant to serve.\\" The Court held that the residual clause was unconstitutionally vague, overruling the contrary holdings in James and Sykes. Concurrences Justices Kennedy and Thomas wrote separate opinions concurring in judgment, but disagreeing that the residual clause of ACCA is unconstitutionally vague. Dissent Justice Alito dissented, arguing that the court could and therefore should interpret the residual clause in a narrower way that meets constitutional standards. He also found the circumstances of Johnson's sawed-off shotgun conviction, it being in his possession during a drug deal in a public parking lot, could have met even a narrow interpretation of the clause.

Jawshan means \\"steel plate\\" or \\"mail\\" and thus the name of the prayer refers to Muhammad‚Äôs heavy armor in battle. According to Muslims, God taught the prayer to him as a protection from injuries in war, instead of hard armor. The prayer was codified by Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin and mentioned in Balad al-Amin.  History  The Islamic prophet Mohammed used hard and heavy armor during fighting in the war. Because of the tightness of his armor, his body was injured. According to Muslims, during the war, the angel Jibra'il (Gabriel) came and brought him a message from God, teaching prayer to Muhammad to protect him from bad events. Jibra'il said: \\"O‚Äô Muhammad! Your God conveys his salutations to you and has said to take this coat of armor and to recite it as this is a protection for you and your Ummah.\\" The prayer became his armor to protect him against injuries. The name of the prayer was taken from Muhammad‚Äôs heavy armor (Jawshan) in the battle.  Text  The context of the prayer was written by Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al- Abidin and came to him from his great grandfather Muhammad by word of mouth. Afterwards, a narrator and faqih of Shia Islam, Ibrahim ibn Ali A‚Äômeli Kafa‚Äômi, mentioned the Jawshan Kabir context in book Balad al-Amin. The Jawshan Kabir prayer contains 100 parts. 25 of these parts start with I entreat You by Your Name. Names of God are recited after the phrase. In all, the supplication comprises 250 names of Allah and 750 attributes of Allah and request from Allah. For this reason, the Jawshan Kabir prayer is known as Ism- e-A‚Äô·∫ìam, i.e., the greatest name (of God). A same phrase is repeated at the end of each part. The meaning of this sentence is \\"Praise be to Thee, there is no God but Thee, The Granter of all Succor (Mercy!, Mercy!), Protect us from the Fire, O Lord.\\"  Part of the Jawshan Kabir Prayer  ÿßŸÑŸÑŸéŸëŸáŸèŸÖŸéŸë ÿ•ŸêŸÜŸêŸë€å ÿ£Ÿéÿ≥Ÿíÿ£ŸéŸÑŸè⁄©Ÿé ÿ®Ÿêÿßÿ≥ŸíŸÖŸê⁄©Ÿé €åŸéÿß ÿ≠ŸéŸÜŸéŸëÿßŸÜŸè €åŸéÿß ŸÖŸéŸÜŸéŸëÿßŸÜŸè €åŸéÿß ÿØŸé€åŸéŸëÿßŸÜŸè €åŸéÿß ÿ®Ÿèÿ±ŸíŸáŸéÿßŸÜŸè €åŸéÿß ÿ≥ŸèŸÑŸíÿ∑ŸéÿßŸÜŸè €åŸéÿß ÿ±Ÿêÿ∂ŸíŸàŸéÿßŸÜŸè €åŸéÿß ÿ∫ŸèŸÅŸíÿ±ŸéÿßŸÜŸè €åŸéÿß ÿ≥Ÿèÿ®Ÿíÿ≠ŸéÿßŸÜŸè €åŸéÿß ŸÖŸèÿ≥Ÿíÿ™ŸéÿπŸéÿßŸÜŸè €åŸéÿß ÿ∞Ÿéÿß ÿßŸÑŸíŸÖŸéŸÜŸêŸë ŸàŸé ÿßŸÑŸíÿ®Ÿé€åŸéÿßŸÜŸê ÿ≥Ÿèÿ®Ÿíÿ≠ÿßŸÜŸéŸÉŸé Ÿäÿß ŸÑÿß ÿßŸêŸÑŸáŸé ÿßŸêŸÑÿßŸë ÿßŸéŸÜŸíÿ™Ÿé ÿßŸÑŸíÿ∫ŸéŸàŸíÿ´Ÿé ÿßŸÑŸíÿ∫ŸéŸàŸíÿ´Ÿé ÿÆŸéŸÑŸêŸëÿµŸíŸÜÿß ŸÖŸêŸÜŸé ÿßŸÑŸÜŸëÿßÿ±Ÿê Ÿäÿß ÿ±Ÿéÿ®ŸêŸë English translation of the part is: I entreat You by Your Names: ::O the All-Kind and Caring, (Who manifests Himself with His Mercy and is inclined (even) toward those who turn away from Him,) ::O the All-Bounteous and Favorng, ::O the Supreme Ruler and All- Requiting (of good and evil), ::O the All-Forgiving and Demonstrating, ::O the All-Proving and Demonstrating, ::O the Absolute, Eternal Authority, ::O the All-Glorified, Who is absolutely free from all deficiencies and imperfections and from doing anything wrong or in vain, ::O He Whose help is always sought, ::O the Owner of all bounty and goodness and eternal exposition, (Who nourishes his creature with His infinite blessings, and who communication His decrees to all His creatures in the most perfectly eloquent way,) ::O He Whose protection is sufficient against all fear and danger, All-Glorified are You; there is no deity but You! Mercy! Mercy! Save us from the Fire!  Recitation  Muslims often read the Jawshan kabir in Laylat al-Qadr in Ramadan but some Hadiths recommend reading it at the beginning of Ramadan. Imam Ali said to his son, Husayn ibn Ali, to memorize and write this supplication on his kafan (burial shroud). Also, there are several hadiths from the prophet Muhammad that state that whoever recites this prayer will receive rewards in the world and Akhirah. Abbas Qumi wrote the prayer in his book Mafatih al-Janan.  Writing  According to the book of Urwath al-Wutha of Mohammed Kazem Yazdi, writing Dua Jawshan Kabir (as well as writing the whole of Quran and Du'a Jawshan Sagheer) on the shroud is deemed as a Mustahab practice;Yazdi, Urwat al-Wuthqa, Vol. 2, P.76 it has also been mentioned through Husayn ibn Ali that it is permissible to write Jawshan Kabir and Jawshan Saqeer on the shroud, but, in order not to be Najis, it is better not to write on the parallel or lower of Awrah.Lawame' Sahebqerani, Vol. 2, P.230  See also  * Jawshan Sagheer * Du'a Nudba * Du'a al-Faraj * Ramadan * Du'a al-Baha * Supplication of Abu Hamza al-Thumali * Mujeer Du'a * The supplication of opening * Dua Ahd  References  Shia prayers Salah terminology Islamic terminology Ramadan ","title":"Jawshan Kabir"},{"id":"47090723","text":"John Wheeler (7 December 1853 - 18 April 1915) was an Australian politician who was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly between 1889 and 1891.

In post-colonial Burma, the Office of the Auditor General was initially established in 1948 under the Parliament's Auditor General Act of 1948, which provided for the appointment of the Auditor General. In 1974, the Pyithu Hluttaw passed the Council of People‚Äôs Inspectors Law, which repealed the 1948 law and merged all auditing agencies, except the Controller of Military Accounts, into a centralised agency, the Central Accounts Office, in January 1974. On 27 September 1988, the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), which had recently seized power, appointed an Auditor General and Deputy Auditor General, under Order No. 7/88, and repealed the 1975 Law under Order No. 5/88 and the Auditor General Law of 1988. On 8 March 1994, the State Law and Order Restoration Council replaced the Accounting Law, which established an Office of the Auditor General of the Union (OAG) that acts as the Secretariat of the Myanmar Accountancy Council, the nation's professional accountancy body. OAG's functions are currently governed by the 2008 Constitution of Myanmar (Burma) and the Auditor General of the Union Law of 2010, which repealed the 1988 law. Thein Htaik died and a new Auditor General, U Myo Myint, was appointed to the position in 2016.

Gameplay The Amiga, Atari ST and Macintosh versions are different from the original 8-bit game, bearing similarity in its graphical style and gameplay to the 1991 game Gods. The final section of the game involves riding on back of an undead dragon. Plot Stormlord has succeeded in his mission to free the realm's fairies, but failed to slay the wicked Queen Bahd, who managed to escape and vanished. Eventually, after many years of peace and harmony, Bahd has returned, this time in league with Satan himself. With his help, she has again kidnapped the fairies, and so Stormlord has to return and finish the job he originally set out to do. His task is to locate, free and then deliver the imprisoned fairies from Satan's Palace, through the Pits of Hell and the Enchanted Forest, to the devil-ridden skies of Heaven, where he can use the amassed power of the rescued fairy-folk to defeat the forces of evil once and for all.

Lincoln Manor is located within the Richmond District, in the Northwest portion of San Francisco. Lincoln Manor is bounded by 36th Avenue to the East, 38th Avenue to the West, Clement Street to the North, Geary Boulevard to the South, and is bisected by Shore View Avenue.http://propertiessanfrancisco.com/Neighborhoods/district1.htm Its single-family generally large detached homes were developed between approximately 1914-1916 by Lyon & Hoag as a so-called \\"restricted residence park,\\" built by the S.A. Born Building Company, builders of West Clay Park and Sea Cliff. Lincoln Manor was promoted by its developers as a residence park with ocean views facing south instead of west. The enclave abuts Land's End, Lincoln Park, and the Legion of Honor, and is close to Sea Cliff, the Balboa Street shopping district, and the Katherine Delmar Burke School. Architectural style As a San Francisco Chronicle article described in 2004, Lincoln Manor's \\"detached, stucco and wood-sided, two-story Edwardian villas with small front lawns, mix classical friezes with Arts and Crafts exposed roof rafters.\\" A number of the model homes were designed by architect Ida McCain, who designed hundreds of homes in San Francisco in the 1910s, which made her one of the most prolific female architects from the 1910s to the 1930s. McCain went on to design a handful of other homes in Lincoln Manor, including the home of prominent real estate developer Stephen A. Born, who developed Lincoln Manor and lived in the neighborhood at the corner of 38th Avenue and the alley known as \\"Auto Drive\\". The San Francisco Chronicle also attributed to architect McCain the four residences starting on the corner of 38th Avenue and Shore View Avenue heading north on 38th Avenue, which originally were the residences of Frederick J.

The hurricane originated from a tropical depression that formed near Dakar, Senegal, on September 6. Traversing the Atlantic Ocean, the cyclone struck the Lesser Antilles, Puerto Rico, and the Bahamas as a powerful hurricane. Early on September 17, the storm made landfall near West Palm Beach, Florida, as a Category 4 hurricane on the modern day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. Thereafter, it moved further inland across the Southeastern United States and became extratropical over North Carolina on September 20, before the remnants lost their identity over Ontario on September 21. Along the east coast of Florida, the most severe damage was reported from Miami to Fort Pierce, particularly in Palm Beach County. In West Palm Beach, one of the most severely affected coastal cities, a total of 1,711 houses were destroyed and 6,369 others suffered damage, which left about 2,100 families homeless. Additionally, the hurricane demolished 268 businesses and affected 490 others. There were four deaths, and severe damage totaling just under $13.8 million (1928 USD). At Palm Beach, which had many houses owned by wealthy individuals, approximately 1,500 houses and 500 businesses were damaged. Damage totaled around $10 million. Inland, many communities on the southern and eastern shores of Lake Okeechobee, such as the cities of Belle Glade, Canal Point, Chosen, Miami Locks (today Lake Harbor), Pahokee, and South Bay, were ravaged by flooding after storm surge resulted in water pouring out of the shallow lake over the small dikes. Numerous structures were swept away or destroyed, and at least 2,500 people drowned. Overall, the hurricane left at least $25 million in damage. Background A tropical depression developed just offshore the west coast of Africa on September 6. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm later that day, shortly before passing south of the Cape Verde Islands. Further intensification was slow and halted by late on September 7. However, about 48 hours later, the storm resumed strengthening and became a Category 1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. The system reached Category 4 intensity before striking Guadeloupe on September 12. Around midday on September 13, the storm strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane, peaking with maximum sustained winds of 160 mph (268 km/h). About six hours later, the system made landfall in Puerto Rico; it was the only recorded tropical cyclone to strike the island as a Category 5. After emerging into the Atlantic, the storm weakened slightly, falling to Category 4 intensity. It began crossing through the Bahamas on September 16. Early on September 17, the storm made landfall near West Palm Beach, Florida, with winds of 145 mph (235 km/h). While crossing Florida, the system weakened significantly, falling to Category 1 intensity late on September 17. It curved north-northeastward and briefly re-emerged into the Atlantic on September 18, but soon made another landfall near Edisto Island, South Carolina, with winds of 85 mph (140 km/h). Early on the following day, the system weakened to a tropical storm and became extratropical over North Carolina hours later. After World War I, South Florida experienced a land boom. The land boom brought new construction and large population increases, with the number of residents in West Palm Beach quadrupling between 1920 and 1927. A New York Times article from 1925 noted that the development in Florida \\"yields no parallel\\". However, the land boom began faltering after the 1926 Miami hurricane and real estate scams. Inland, the communities along the shore of Lake Okeechobee were mostly an agrarian society. Agricultural productivity rapidly took hold in the area due to the rich, black muck soil. Prior to the 1928 hurricane, Lake Okeechobee was surrounded by a mud dike averaging in height. The southwest side of dike was breached during the 1926 Miami hurricane, devastating Clewiston and Moore Haven and drowning as many as 300 people.Barnes p. 120 Since 1924, the Florida Legislature attempted to secure authorization and funding for flood control around Lake Okeechobee. However, according to Congressman Herbert J. Drane, little had been done to mitigate a similar disaster. Preparations In the days prior to the storm, several forecasters declared that there was virtually no chance of the hurricane making landfall in Florida. Richard W. Gray, chief meteorologist at the Weather Bureau office in Miami, predicted on September 12 that the storm would move westward and eventually dissipate over the Yucat√°n Channel.Kleinberg, p. 49 However, the hurricane instead moved northwestward after striking Puerto Rico. On September 14, a newspaper noted that there \\"seemed to be a tendency toward a curve east-ward,\\" meaning that a landfall in Florida was highly unlikely.Kleinberg, p. 53 A. J. Mitchell of the Jacksonville Weather Bureau office stated that \\"the storm no longer threatens the lower East Coast of Florida.\\", while Gray declared it \\"improbable that it [the hurricane] will affect the east coast of Florida.\\" Mariano Guti√©rrez- Lanza of the Jesuit observatory in Belen, Cuba, agreed and noted that Cuba and Florida should not be concerned by the hurricane. However, that same day, a weather report received by a wireless station in Jupiter indicated that Florida would indeed experience \\"some or all of the storm.\\"Kleinberg, p. 60 Although the local newspapers such as The Palm Beach Post began acknowledging on September 15 that the hurricane may strike Florida, Gray remained entirely confident that the storm would not make landfall and instead predicted that winds would reach only .Kleinberg, p. 61 However, Gray still issued storm warnings from Miami to Titusville and also advised that \\"every precaution should be taken in case hurricane warnings should be found necessary on the east Florida coast.\\" Early on September 16, a hurricane warning was issued from Miami to Daytona Beach, with Gray predicting that the storm would make landfall near Jupiter. The agency advised residents to enact precautions for the hurricane, citing the potential for strong winds and waves. Throughout the day, hurricane warnings were also posted for the west coast from Punta Rassa to Apalachicola, and after the storm recurved, hurricane warnings were extended along the east coast to Jacksonville. Despite the perceived improbability of landfall in the days preceding the storm's passage, the West Palm Beach chapter of the American Red Cross began preparing for the storm.Kleinberg, p. 52 Dr. William J. Buck, likely the only doctor between Pahokee and Moore Haven and also president of the Belle Glade town council and the founder of the town's American Legion post, was skeptical of the Weather Bureau's predictions of the storm missing South Florida. He and his legionnaires warned residents in the Lake Okeechobee region of the approaching cyclone.Kleinberg, pp. 61‚Äì62 At South Bay, Frank Schuster made several car trips to save 211 people by transporting them to higher ground. The Seminoles at the Brighton Seminole Indian Reservation in Glades County evacuated to higher ground after observing retreating wildlife.Mykle, p. 132 Hours before the storm made landfall, many in the communities surrounding Lake Okeechobee either crowded into a house or evacuated to the building they believed was securest, such as the Belle Glade Hotel, the Glades Hotel, and Henry Martin's store in Belle Glade, with the Glades Hotel sheltering 20 people and the Belle Glade Hotel having nearly 150 refugees.Mykle, pp. 157‚Äì158 About 500 people in Lake Worth were sheltered inside the Gulf Stream Hotel during the storm. In West Palm Beach, food and thousands of candles, kerosene lamps, and boards were sold on September 16. A number of residents boarded up their homes and then secured their ornamental trees and plants.Mykle, p. 135 At the building then being used as the Palm Beach County Courthouse, approximately 500 people sought shelter inside.Kleinberg, p. 75 In Jupiter, 20 people sought refuge in a grocery store, while 25 others stayed at a newly constructed elementary school. A number of African Americans took shelter in a school building in West Jupiter. Impact Aftermath of the hurricane in southern Florida Strong winds struck southern Florida as the hurricane moved ashore, with three unofficial reports of 100 mph (160 km/h). In Miami to the south of the center, winds reached 78 mph (126 km/h), and farther south, Key West reported winds of only . The eye at landfall was wide, and after moving inland crossed Lake Okeechobee, where a calm was reported for 30 minutes. Winds at Canal Point, adjacent to the lake, were estimated as high as 160 mph (255 km/h); the anemometer blew away after reporting sustained winds of 75 mph (120 km/h). The pressure at Canal Point dropped to 942 mbar (27.82 inHg). The lowest pressure north of Lake Okeechobee was 966 mbar (28.54 inHg) in Bartow, and along the west coast, winds reached in Tampa. Overall, property damage was estimated at $25 million. It is estimated if a similar storm were to strike as of the year 2002, it would cause about $16 billion in damages. The cyclone remains one of three Atlantic hurricanes to strike the southern mainland of Florida with a central pressure below 940 mbar (27.76 inHg), the others being the 1926 Miami hurricane and Hurricane Andrew of 1992. Because of well-issued hurricane warnings, residents were prepared for the storm, and the number of lives lost in the coastal Palm Beach County was only 26. However, it is estimated that there were at least 2,500 deaths, primarily in the areas surrounding Lake Okeechobee. Around 75% of the fatalities were migrant farm workers, making identification of both dead and missing bodies very difficult; as a result of this, the count of the dead is not very accurate. The Red Cross estimated the number of fatalities at 1,836, which was taken as the official count by the National Weather Service for many years (and exactly equal to the official count for Hurricane Katrina). Older sources usually list 3,411 as the hurricane's total count of fatalities, including the Caribbean. However, in 2003 the United States death count was revised as \\"at least\\" 2,500, making the Okeechobee hurricane the second-deadliest natural disaster in United States history behind the Galveston Hurricane of 1900; a mass grave at the Port Mayaca Cemetery east of Port Mayaca contains the bodies of 1,600 victims of the hurricane. In addition to the human fatalities, 1,278 livestock and 47,389 poultry were killed, respectively. Agricultural was impacted significantly, with the storm destroying what may have been the largest \\"citrus crop in the history of the industry\\". Approximately 6% of oranges and 18% of grapefruit were ruined, respectively. Harvesting the remaining crops was delayed until mid-October due to inundated groves.Neely, p. 285 Communications also suffered severely. Throughout the state, 32,000 households were left without telephone service and 400 poles were broken and about 2,500 others leaning.Neely, p. 282 Then-Governor of Florida John W. Martin estimated that 15,000 families were left homeless in Palm Beach County alone. Additionally, about 11,500 families would need to be \\"re-established\\". Homestead to Lake Worth Storm destruction left in Pompano Beach The storm produced nearly of rainfall in the vicinity of Homestead, leaving high water that damaged some truck crops and shrubbery. In Miami, sustained winds reached ,Mykle, p. 94 generally confining damage to awnings, plate-glass windows, trees, and vegetation, while interrupting electrical and telegraph services. Heavy rainfall damaged some homes and offices and left some streets in southern Miami impassable. The Florida East Coast Railway Station in Hallandale Beach was nearly destroyed. Windows and roofs were damaged in Hollywood and Fort Lauderdale, but damage was minor overall. At the latter, the storm downed power lines, telephone wires, and trees, and destroyed car garages. Winds also deroofed some buildings. Storm surge and abnormally high tides inundated portions of coastal roads in the vicinity of Las Olas Boulevard, though little damage occurred to the roadways themselves. The hurricane caused two fatalities in the city. The roadway along the coast to the north of Fort Lauderdale was covered with sand. The recently constructed Pompano Theater in Pompano Beach was severely damaged. The Kester Building, a drug store, and a grocery store also suffered impact. Nearly all small frame houses were destroyed in Deerfield Beach, while several citizens estimated that at least 50% of homes were demolished. The town's post office, depot, and an entire business block were also destroyed. A freight train was blown off its tracks. An eight year old boy drowned in a ditch near where his family sought refugee, while 51 additional people were injured throughout Broward County. In Boca Raton, longtime resident and husband of former mayor Jones Cleveland \\"J.C.\\" Mitchell, Floy Mitchell, recalled that almost all buildings suffered some degree of damage, with nearly a third of the structures demolished. A total of 32 homes were damaged, while 4 businesses were demolished and 25 others were severely damaged. At the Cloister Inn, windows were shattered and the roof was damaged. Across the street from the Cloister Inn, 32 freight cars belonging to a train along the Florida East Coast Railway were tossed by the wind into a nearby ditch. A short distance to the north, a warehouse and a building occupied by a restaurant and a store were flattened. One death occurred in Boca Raton.Kleinberg, p. 245 At the Japanese community known as Yamato, several frame homes were demolished, while a store was severely damaged. In Delray Beach, four churches suffered severe damage and the Alta Repp and Seacrest hotels both lost a portion of their roof. A total of 277 homes were demolished, while 750 other dwellings were impaired, leaving about 350 families homeless. Additionally, 77 businesses were damaged and 19 businesses suffered destruction, including an ice plant, a dry cleaner, a mill works plant, and businesses adjacent to the Masonic Temple. The bridge across the Intracoastal Waterway was mostly intact; this was the only passable bridge between Delray Beach and West Palm Beach. The storm left four fatalities and just over $1 million in damage.Kleinberg, p. 244 One death occurred after a woman was struck by a falling chimney, while another person died when his house collapsed. A report compiled by The Palm Beach Post on September 17 noted that \\"several others, mostly negroes, were killed\\", but listed only one death for Delray Beach on September 18. St. Andrew's Episcopal Church In Boynton Beach, 15 people were injured by a roof collapse while taking refugee in the auditorium of a high school. First United Methodist Church was destroyed, along with its records. Eighteen businesses suffered complete destruction, while thirty-four others were damaged. A total of 46 dwellings were destroyed, with another 255 impaired. The hurricane caused approximately $1 million in damage. Under the bridge across the Intracoastal Waterway, two barges were driven under the structure, causing it to move upward by almost . In Lantana, all houses were badly damaged, while the Florida East Coast Railway Station was destroyed. The bridge crossing the Intercoast Waterway was moved off its turntable and twisted sideways into the water, while the approaches and tresses were wrecked. One death occurred in the city after a man suffered from exposure and succumbed to his condition on September 27. In Lake Worth, a damage survey shortly after the storm indicated that the hurricane destroyed 600 homes and damaged 1,500 other dwellings, leaving about 700 people homeless., Overall, less than 10% of homes escaped damage.Koontz, p. 225 Approximately 50 businesses were wrecked and 200 others received damage ‚Äì roughly 75% of buildings in the business district. Several additional buildings were demolished, including a sporting goods store, St. Andrew's Episcopal Church, and First Presbyterian Church. The Oakley Theater was nearly destroyed, with the roof and walls crushed. Strong winds deroofed the Gulf Stream Hotel and severely damaged the fifth and sixth floors, while storm surge left portions of the lobby with up to of sand. Damage at various locations in Lake Worth Other severely damaged buildings in the city included the Scottish Rites Cathedral, the Masonic Temple, a hotel, a car dealership, an investment company, and the auditorium of Lake Worth Community High School. Additionally, the Old Lake Worth City Hall was partially destroyed. Along the northwest corner of the building, the exterior wall in its entirety collapsed, while the north tower was destroyed and the bay at the northeastern side of the building was removed. The roof suffered complete destruction. As a result, Lake Worth was without a functional center for city government. A temporary city hall was established at the Lauriston building. Additionally, nearly of the bridge across the Intracoastal Waterway collapsed, leaving the bridge \\"virtually beyond repair.\\" Damage in Lake Worth reached approximately $4 million, which included about $400,000 in damage to city properties. Three deaths occurred in Lake Worth, two from illnesses related to exposure to the storm; the other was a man who suffered from apoplexy, blamed on excessive exertion in the aftermath of the hurricane. The city of Greenacres, incorporated only two years earlier, was almost completely wiped out during the hurricane in 1926 and was virtually destroyed again by this storm. Two deaths occurred in Greenacres. At Loxahatchee Groves, almost every dwelling was knocked off their foundations. Along the coast, there were only minor washouts between Delray Beach and Briny Breezes, where a few homes suffered slight damage. However, the area north of Briny Breezes to just south of the Lake Worth Casino, was \\"completely washed away\\". In South Palm Beach, the Mirimar Inn was nearly destroyed. Its roof was torn off and blown into nearby houses. The structure itself was \\"twisted\\" and appeared irreparable. West Palm Beach to Jupiter Damage in West Palm Beach In the week leading up to the hurricane, West Palm Beach observed of precipitation, at least of which fell during the storm. Among the buildings destroyed include a furniture store, pharmacy, warehouse, hotel, school, and an ironworks, while many other structures were unroofed. All of the theaters in the city were damaged. The Kettler Theater, the first theater built in West Palm Beach, suffered severe damage, totaling about $125,000. The Arcade and the Stanley likewise were badly impaired, but the Stanley quickly reopened by October. Additionally, the Flamingo was destroyed, with only walls remaining standing, \\"and precious little of them.\\" Skylights at the county courthouse shattered, flooding the Criminal Court of Record rooms.Mykle, p. 77 Many of the buildings that collapsed were wooden-frame, while the few concrete-built structures remained standing.Mykle, p. 170 Only one business on Clematis Street - the main business thoroughfares of West Palm Beach - escaped serious damage. Because the hospital was partially destroyed, a temporary hospital was set up in the Pennsylvania Hotel. However, the hotel itself was damaged; the chimney crashed through 14 floors, causing about $60,000 in damage. The fire station also collapsed, though the fire bell remained intact. At the city library, then located at City Park (now known as Flagler Park), more than half of the books were destroyed and the floor was covered with about of water and mud. Winds shattered a skylight at city hall, damaging bookkeeper records. Damage at the Dixie Court Apartments Banyan Boulevard (then known as First Street), considered the auto row of West Palm Beach, was reduced to \\"a mass of debris.\\" Only two buildings remained standing on the north side of the street between Dixie Highway and Olive Avenue, owning to the frail construction of the business buildings in that section of the city. The roof and equipment in The Palm Beach Post building were damaged after the chimney fell. However, The Palm Beach Post was able to publish a newspaper.Kleinberg, p. 133 At the Palm Beach Times, the building was partly demolished, causing the company's machines to be damaged by rain. Despite the damage, the Palm Beach Times also published a short edition on the afternoon of September 17. The Central Farmers Trust Company, the only bank in the city, was deroofed and flooded. The Comeau Building, which has been listed as a National Register of Historic Place since 1996, suffered severe damage to its roof tiles; they were subsequently replaced. Prior to the storm, the American Legion building was designated as the headquarters for the Red Cross, but the building was severely damaged, forcing the Red Cross to set up its relief post at another building. At Palm Beach High School, then located where the Dreyfoos School of the Arts stands today, the clock tower collapsed.Kleinberg, p. 83 Most buildings at Saint Ann's Catholic Church were deroofed, including the rectory and school facilities, while the Bradley Hall Towers were destroyed. Rainfall entering the buildings damaged furniture, plastering, and vestments. Flamingo Park was among the worst hit areas of the city. Many homes suffered \\"untold damage\\", while a shopping center on Lake Avenue experienced near complete destruction. In contrast, the El Cid and Northwood neighborhoods were mainly inflicted with only \\"superficial\\" impact. Many streets in Vedado were blocked by fallen pine trees. At Bacon Park, the area west of Parker Avenue was desolate. The L. Van Son House, proclaimed as \\"one of the most unusual landmarks\\", was demolished. Destruction south of the courthouse In the African American section of the city, where most dwellings were built of discarded material, many homes were damaged. On one street, only two houses did not lose either their walls or roof. Walls and cars were cartwheeling down the streets. During the storm, about 100 people ran to a trash incinerator, a concrete- reinforced building.Mykle, p. 171 A few of the local Black churches suffered significant damage. Tabernacle Missionary Baptist Church lost many bricks on its front facade and much of the metal grillwork around the entrances, while the building itself was deroofed. Payne Chapel AME Church, then located at Banyan Boulevard and Tamarind Avenue, was destroyed by the storm. St. Patrick's Catholic Church received about $40,000 in damage.Kleinberg, p. 132 Waves washed up mounds of sand and debris across Banyan Boulevard, Clematis Street, and Datura Street, to Olive Avenue. According to county coroner T. M. Rickards, the streets were \\"shoulder-deep in debris. The suffering throughout was beyond words.\\" A total of 1,711 homes were destroyed and damaged 6,369 others suffered damage, leaving about 2,100 families homeless. Additionally, the hurricane demolished 268 businesses and impacted 490 others. There was severe damage totaling just under $13.8 million and eleven deaths, with one from being fatally struck by debris. At the Southern Bell office in West Palm Beach, a barometric pressure of , the lowest recorded in the history of the United States at the time.Kleinberg, pp. 80‚Äì81 Storm damage in Palm Beach Likewise, there was also severe wind damage in Palm Beach. A few buildings constructed by Henry Flagler, such as The Breakers, the Royal Poinciana Hotel, and Whitehall were damaged. At the Royal Poinciana, the hotel's botanical garden, which contained hundreds of exotic trees and plants, was almost completely destroyed. The golf club suffered severe roof damage, while the course was flooded with several inches to several feet of water. Waves inundated and swept away the foliage and trees at the house of J. Leonard Replogle. Edward T. Stotesbury's estate suffered severe damage and looked like \\"a forest at the front during the war.\\" Rodman Wanamaker's house, known as \\"La Guerida\\" and later the \\"Winter White House\\" during the presidency of John F. Kennedy, suffered heavy damage during the storm. The Alba, Billows, New Palm Beach, and Royal Daneli hotels all suffered water damage, while the Alba Hotel was also deroofed. Nearby, the Rainbow Pier only received structural damage to its railings, though the pier office was blown away. Rain entered the building occupied by Hatches, inc., damaging about 50% of the merchandise. Two bridges on State Road 80 were washed out. The Florida East Coast Bridge lost its railing, but remained partially opened to traffic. Approximately 1,500 houses and 500 businesses were damaged in Palm Beach. Damage totaled around $10 million. Damage to the Premier Hotel in Lake Park (then Kelsey City) Offshore Palm Beach, two Coast Guard cutters from Fernandina Beach, 188 and 230, encountered rough seas generated by the hurricane. Their skippers and crews painstakingly moved the ships into Lake Worth through an inlet. Several holes were punctured in 188 and the ship lost its rudder, while 230 lost its steering gear and about of keel.Mykle, p. 83 Heavy rainfall in Westgate flooded Okeechobee Road. In Riviera Beach, the storm destroyed 500 homes and impacted another 1,000. About 100 businesses were demolished and 50 others suffered losses. Overall, damage in Riviera Beach reached approximately $750,000. The bridge linking Riviera Beach to Singer Island across the Intercoastal Waterway was partly destroyed. Kelsey City, now known as Lake Park, was inflicted with similar impact. During the storm, many residents sought refuge in city hall, which was nearly destroyed by the storm. However, it was later repaired and has been listed as a U.S. National Register of Historic Places since 1981. The gymnasium and auditorium collapsed. Throughout the city, 200 homes were completely wrecked and 300 others were damaged. A total of 75 businesses were destroyed and an equal number suffered impact. The cost of damage in Kelsey City totaled $1 million. In Jupiter, the hurricane destroyed 50 dwellings and impacted 425 others. A total of six businesses were demolished and thirteen others suffered damage. Storm surge left water waist- deep in some areas. A pavilion near the ocean was swept away. Some boathouses were washed off their foundations and then smashed. A boat at the boathouse near the Florida East Coast Railroad bridge was swept out of the building. Nearby, the Loxahatchee River reached at the railroad trestle. In addition to causing damage to homes and businesses, strong winds also toppled telephone poles and overturned cars. Seventeen windmills were demolished at the Pennock Plantation. Two towers were knocked over at the Naval Radio Station Jupiter Inlet. At the Jupiter Inlet Lighthouse, the mortar was reportedly \\"squeezed ... like toothpaste\\" between the bricks during the storm, swaying the tower off the base.Barnes p. 129 The lighthouse keeper, Captain Seabrook, and his son, Franklin, worked to keep the light on during the storm after the electricity went out. After the generator failed to work, they hand-cranked the light's mantle. The building formerly used as a Weather Bureau Office was destroyed. Nearby, six people died after a house was demolished. Six other fatalities occurred west of Jupiter after a school where people sought shelter collapsed.Neely, p. 133 Damage in Jupiter totaled approximately $900,000. Lake Okeechobee region Approximate area of the flood. Note: The Palm Beach County label is misplaced. North of Canal Point has been in Martin County since 1925. Inland, the hurricane wreaked much more widespread destruction along the southeast and north coasts of Lake Okeechobee. Residents had been warned to evacuate the low ground earlier in the day, but after the hurricane did not arrive on schedule, many thought it had missed and returned to their homes. In the weeks prior to storm, heavy rainfall caused the lake to rise between August 10 and September 10 and filled nearby canals and ditches. Additionally, precipitation from the hurricane itself caused Lake Okeechobee to rise further.Barnes p. 130 When the worst of the storm crossed the lake, the south-blowing wind caused a storm surge to overflow the small dike that had been built at the south end of the lake. The resulting flood covered an area of hundreds of square miles with water that in some places was over 20 ft (6 m) deep. Houses were floated off of their foundations and dashed to pieces against any obstacle they encountered. Most survivors and bodies were washed out into the Everglades where many of the bodies were never found. Agricultural losses in the area surrounding Lake Okeechobee were also significant, with virtually all crops destroyed and over 150 tractors suffering damage. On Kreamer Island, many residents received information about the storm when it was too late to evacuate. In some homes, 20‚Äì30 people sought shelter inside and later stood on tables and chairs to remain above the water. Most of the homes were swept away into rows of pine trees and others more than half a mile (0.8 km) away. Despite this, only one person drowned on the island.Barnes p. 131 Residents of Torry Island also did not have ample time to prepare for the storm. They attempted to evacuate, but the causeway was already inundated, forcing twenty-three people to seek refuge in a packinghouse. Floodwaters entered the building, forcing the occupants into the rafters. However, the building was eventually pushed into a nearby canal. Ten people drowned, but thirteen others survived by clinging to a barge or tree tops, while one woman tied herself to a telegraph pole. Others that survived were swept far away from where the building once stood. A teenage boy was carried from the packinghouse to the Everglades Experiment Station in Belle Glade ‚Äì a distance of about .Barnes p. 132 On Ritta Island, a number of people who successfully climbed to the roof of their houses died after being struck by trees or bit by water moccasins.Davis, p. 296 Belle Glade suffered the most deaths of any city by far, with 611 fatalities confirmed. After the dike at Lake Okeechobee failed, water reached at least above ground in portions of Belle Glade.Will, p. 41 At the Glades Hotel, water entered the lobby and rose so rapidly that the last two people to reach the second floor nearly drowned in the stairwell. The Glades Hotel was the only building in the city left intact.Will, p. 35 The first floor of the Belle Glade Hotel was also flooded, forcing the occupants up to the second floor. They were then exposed to the wind and rain after the roof blew off. Nearby, a building containing a restaurant, a furniture store, and a drugstore was deroofed; the 20 to 30 occupants inside fled to the Glades Hotel.Will, pp. 39‚Äì40 Further east, water reached in height at Everglades Experiment Station. The crops in the surrounding area, which were used for experiments, were completely ruined.Kleinberg, p. 120 There, a sustained wind speed of was observed before the anemometer was destroyed. Winds deroofed all buildings except two bungalows, one of which sheltered 40 people, and the service house for the greenhouse. A garage, two labor cabins, and a five-room bungalow were demolished, as was a portion of the greenhouse.Kleinberg, p. 107 The city of Pahokee, mostly situated atop a ridge, resembled an island due to surrounding high water. Low-lying areas quickly flooded, with several rows of homes swept away, including at Bacom Point and areas near the Pelican River.Mykle, p. 176 Many of the deaths in the city occurred when the storm surge that had moved up the river retreated.Mykle, p. 237 At the height of the storm, dwellings on the ridge began washing away, with nothing remaining on the west side of the ridge.Mykle, p. 197 Overall, approximately 75% of buildings and homes in the city were destroyed, with the bank and school house being \\"probably the only two buildings left standing in any substantial condition.\\" A total of 153 deaths were confirmed in Pahokee. Newspapers such as The Palm Beach Times initially reported about 450 deaths at Pelican Bay, located between Belle Glade and Pahokee. However, Everglades News editor Howard Sharp noted that the death toll was \\"not understandable to the persons familiar with the region\\" and that \\"there is no 'village of Pelican Bay'\\".Will, p. 68 Canal Point and Port Mayaca were likely inundated with only of water, sparing the cities significant damage. One death occurred in the former,Kleinberg, p. 99 caused by a man who experienced \\"heart trouble\\" following the destruction of his home. In South Bay, nearly all houses were destroyed and several buildings were unroofed. The structures not suffering any damage floated away. Many boats and barged in the canal were \\"resting at all angles.\\", some of which were sunk or disabled, while many homes were washed to the banks of the canal. The streets were littered were broken lumber. Debris such as the remains of custard apple trees, twisted metal roofing, and wood were piled against the bridges.Mykle, p. 183 At least 160 fatalities occurred in the city, while the American Red Cross indicated 247 deaths. Throughout the 1920s, Okeelanta suffered several floods and muck fires. Finally, the town was flooded severely during the storm and was subsequently abandoned. Bean City was nearly completely destroyed during the hurricane; only one home remained standing and at least a dozen people perished. But the city was eventually rebuilt by founder Arthur Wells. Sebring Farms was reduced to piles of rubber, with only four tall royal palm trees left standing.Neely, p. 220 Only six people in the town survived.Neely, p. 195 The hotel at Miami Locks (today known as Lake Harbor) was the sole structure to survive the storm.Neely, p. 221 The bodies of many dead animals were resting on the canal banks.Mykle, p. 184 Ninety-nine people died in that town.Neely, p. 123 In Chosen, only two people managed to escape a house that sheltered nineteen people. At Henry Martin's store, the building lost its roof during the storm, forcing the occupants to move into the restroom. A house that was full of people floated about half a mile (0.8 km) from its original location. The occupants were unaware that the house was moving until it collided with a railroad embankment.Barnes pp. 132‚Äì133 Twenty three people died in Chosen. As the rear eyewall passed over the area, the flood reversed itself, breaking the dikes along the northern coast of the lake and causing a similar but smaller flooding. Route 98, then known as Conner's Highway, was closed until January, when the bridge across the Onosohatchee River at Taylor Creek was replaced after the original bridge was carried about upstream during the storm. In Okeechobee County, homes along the lake were destroyed by the storm surge, while dwellings within the city of Okeechobee were severely impacted or demolished by winds of at least . However, brick and concrete-structured dwellings received little damage. A number of three-story business buildings collapsed during the storm. Almost all roads were left impassable, while communications were nearly wiped out. Overall, 27 deaths occurred in Okeechobee County. Along the southwestern shore of Lake Okeechobee, the towns of Clewiston and Moore Haven were both flooded, but much of the damage to houses was due to strong winds. In the former, the railroad tracks were ripped and reduced to \\"a twisted ribbon of steel\\". Floodwaters persisted for several weeks, greatly impeding attempts to clean up the devastation. On October 23, over five weeks after the storm, Florida National Guard Major B. M. Atkinson reported of standing-water along the side of the roads to Belle Glade, Okeechobee, and South Bay.Neely, p. 287 Elsewhere Rainfall totals associated with the hurricane In Fort Myers, property damage was slight, limited mostly to scores of small boats and fishing smacks along the waterfront. The Cuban schooner Isabel Alvado sank offshore Boca Grande. The crew, who were immigrants, were rescued by the Coast Guard and later deported. In Martin County, a bridge connecting Stuart and Palm City was severely damaged and closed to traffic as a result. A temporary ferry service across the St. Lucie River was established and operated until repairs to the bridge were complete in the summer of 1929. One fatality was reported in Stuart. In the 1920s, there were plans to build a Hollywood-esque city featuring a movie studio called Picture City. These plans were canceled following the 1928 hurricane and subsequent economic collapse. Throughout Martin County, five deaths and about $4 million in damage occurred, primarily to citrus crops. In Fort Pierce, most of the impact was confined to the waterfront areas. A warehouse, fish houses, docks, and a bridge across the Indian River were destroyed, while several other buildings were unroofed. Damage in the city totaled about $150,000. In the interior areas of Central and North Florida, impact was mainly confined to agricultural losses, particularly citrus, though wind damage occurred to structures. Between Sebring and Lake Wales, 200 telephone poles were toppled, while 60 other telephone poles were knocked down. In Bartow, business building windows were shattered and signs were knocked down, while several roofs and chimneys also suffered damage. One death was reported in Bartow. Winds gusting up to lashed Lakeland. Many trees were uprooted and several buildings were impacted, including the hospital and a number of businesses. At Florida Southern College (FSC), the north side of the gymnasium collapsed while other buildings on campus were damaged to a less degree. The trees in the citrus grove surrounding FSC lost much of their fruit. Overall, Lakeland suffered about $50,000 in damage. Throughout Polk County, 10% of oranges and about 50% of grapefruit were lost, respectively, with the vast majority of groves losing 60% to 75% of grapefruit. Nearly all cigar factories in Tampa were closed after wind and rain drove too much moisture into the buildings. In St. Petersburg, a large section of the roof of a car garage was removed. Otherwise, impact was primarily limited to tree branches falling onto electrical wires. Along the Gulf Coast of Florida, telephone lines were reported downed as far north as between Brooksville and Dade City. Offshore, the fishing smack Wallace A. McDonnell was beach near Piney Point, though all of the crew survived. In Orlando, impact to properties was described as slight. The storm left one death in Orange City. Light damage to citrus was reported in Lake and Orange counties. with only about 10% of the crop lost in the former. Winds up to impacted the Jacksonville area, resulting in minor damage at Jacksonville Beach. Aftermath Damage and flooding along a street in Lake Worth In the immediate aftermath of the storm, available cots and blankets were set up in the churches, courthouses, public buildings, schools, warehouses, and other buildings that would be designated as a shelter. The Gulf Stream Hotel in Lake Worth was converted into a hospital. A total of 1,274 people slept in shelters in West Palm Beach on September 17. With the need for additional cots and blankets, a request for them was sent to the United States Army, which promptly sent 2,000 cots and 1,000 blankets from Fort McPherson in Georgia to relief centers in Belle Glade, Boynton Beach, Canal Point, Jupiter, Kelsey City, Pahokee, Riviera Beach, and West Palm Beach. Many other cots and blankets were later transported to the area. A number of winter residents allowed their homes to be used as shelters. Dr. W. A. Claxton, chief of the Miami Department of Public Welfare, requested antitoxin, typhoid serum, and at least 200 tetanus serums. The Florida Department of Health granted the request. Of the inoculations distributed, there were 10,349 for typhoid, 1,025 for smallpox, and 337 for tetanus. A health bulletin issued on September 28 indicated that due to vaccinations and other efforts by state and local health departments, there was \\"no outbreak of typhoid, malaria, influenza, or any other communicable diseases, and we do no anticipate any.\\" Overall, 210 doctors and 78 nurses worked in the disaster area, each accumulating more than 50 hours of service. Olive Street in West Palm Beach Many other individuals and organizations contributed to relief efforts. A group of men with trucks were dispatched northward from Miami to clear trees and other debris from the roads. They worked quickly enough to reach West Palm Beach by the night of September 17. Early on September 18, a train leaving Miami carried 20 doctors and 20 nurses to West Palm Beach. At least 100 people were brought to Miami for medical treatment. In addition to trains, supplies were transported to Palm Beach County by 93 vehicles making an average of 553 trips per day and 51 trucks recording a mean of 206 trips daily. Thirty-eight motor boats and 4 airplanes also delivered supplies. On September 23, then-Governor of Georgia Lamartine Griffin Hardman offered aid to Florida, urging his state to assist \\"in every possible way.\\" On November 18, every Catholic church in the United States contributed a portion of their offering, with $84,200 in aid given to Florida and Puerto Rico. Masonic lodges throughout the United States collectively donated more than $107,000.Kleinberg, p. 131 Colonel E. R. Bradley, one of the wealthiest residents of Palm Beach and owner of a casino in the town, donated $10,000. J. P. Morgan gave also $10,000 to the Red Cross. Then-gubernatorial candidate Doyle E. Carlton contributed $10,000 on September 20 after surveying the damage.Kleinberg, p. 154 A creamery in West Palm Beach quickly distributed 1,400 gallons of milk.Kleinberg, p. 137 In Miami, WQAM hosted a telethon on September 22, which also included live entertainment from a Shriners band at a park amphitheater. The event collected about $1,000 for the victims of the storm. The city of Miami also donated 2 tanks of chlorine, 20 barrels of disinfectant, 24 lanterns, and 5,000 paper cups. City council members of San Francisco, which suffered from a devastating earthquake in 1906, agreed to donate $10,000 to South Florida without discussion. Issaquena County, Mississippi, among the most ravaged by a Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, also contributed money. Although many railroad stations south of Kelsey City were damaged, train service was restored on the morning of September 17.Kleinberg, p. 135 Railroad companies provided free fare to storm victims until October 4, a service used by 1,427 people. After that day, the Red Cross paid for the transportation of people who were destitute. Looting became a serious issue in the aftermath of the storm, especially in Palm Beach and West Palm Beach. In the latter, Police Chief Frank H. Matthews ordered a sunset-to-sunrise curfew, unless a person had a pass or permit signed by Matthews or his assistant, or if \\"an extreme emergency demands it\\". The Red Cross would also issued passes. Day and night, militia members and personnel of 124th Infantry Regiment of the Florida Army National Guard patrols the streets of West Palm Beach. On September 19, Governor Martin summoned all Florida National Guard members to serve in other functions as well as patrolling against looting.Kleinberg, p. 156 Several mansions in Palm Beach were robbed, including very expensive paintings stolen at one home. Martial law was declared on September 19, but rescinded the following day. Checkpoints were ordered by Palm Beach County Sheriff Robert C. Baker along the main highways at Lake Worth and Jupiter. At the south shore Lake Okeechobee communities, Dr. Buck took charge. Because no vehicles were operable, roads flooded, and minimal food and water supplies, Buck ordered nearly 100 women and children to walk to West Palm Beach ‚Äì a distance of ‚Äì seen as their best chance for survival. After several miles, the women and children were eventually met by ambulances from West Palm Beach. Dr. Buck also delegated fellow American Legionnaires and recruited other volunteers to clear the roads in the vicinity of Lake Okeechobee. By the afternoon of September 20, the roads were cleared from Belle Glade to the agricultural station, Chosen, and South Bay.Kleinberg, p. 142 Later, in collaboration with United States Coast Guard members from Fort Lauderdale, the road between Belle Glade and Pahokee was cleared, where debris was piled as high as .Kleinberg, p. 145 Dr. Buck also ordered some men to break into the ice house, which would be a source of freshwater. Woodlawn Cemetery in West Palm Beach Governor John W. Martin, along with Florida Attorney General Fred Henry Davis, chief engineer Fred C. Elliott, and Florida Adjutant General Vivian B. Collins, assessed the disaster area in the communities along Lake Okeechobee beginning on September 22. After the conclusion of the tour, Martin telegraphed every mayor in Florida to aid the victims of the storm and apologized for not issuing that appeal sooner. Martin also described the scene: With nearly 3,000 telephone poles damaged or snapped and 32,000 service outages, Southern Bell and AT&T; quickly began work on restoring telephone service, sending workers from their centers in Atlanta and Jacksonville, respectively. The companies shipped about 225 tons of copper wire and 20 rail cars full of poles and switchboards. The Southern Bell office in Delray Beach was nearly destroyed, causing workers to move the service center to a nearby building.Kleinberg, p. 134 By the morning of September 18, water service was restored in the central sections of West Palm Beach and was expected to expand to other areas of the city quickly.Kleinberg, p. 157 In Palm Beach, about fifty men shoveled sand off Ocean Boulevard and cut down damaged palm trees with crosscut saws.Kleinberg, p. 159 On September 19, then-Mayor of West Palm Beach Vincent Oaksmith issued a \\"no work, no food\\" order, effectively stating that all able-bodied men should work toward relief efforts.Kleinberg, p. 158 The Delray Beach City Council issued a similar order.Kleinberg, p. 138 Initially, rebuilding in West Palm Beach was slow. City Manager A. E. Parker issued a public notice that stated \\"Because of the grave emergency now existing and the great need for shelter, it has not been deemed wise to insist upon building permits for necessary repairs.\\" Many severely damaged buildings were declared \\"public menaces\\" and condemned for demolition, effective on October 23. On September 20, the West Palm Beach City Commission held a special session that allowed the City Treasurer to authorize an in advance requisition payment of $50,000 to the Red Cross. Also on the agenda was an anti-price gauging measure, which would fine individuals up to $500 and imprison them for a maximum of 30 days if they sold items above the pre- September 16 price.Kleinberg, p. 161 In the aftermath of the hurricane in coastal Florida, it became apparent that well-constructed buildings with shutters had suffered practically no damage from winds that caused serious structural problems to lesser buildings. Buildings with well-constructed frames, and those made of steel, concrete, brick, or stone were largely immune to the winds, and the use of shutters prevented damage to windows and the interior of the buildings. Coming on the heels of the 1926 Miami hurricane where a similar pattern had been noticed, one lasting result of the 1928 storm was improved building codes. A destroyed auto dealership on the coast. Red Cross Many chapters of the Red Cross in Florida took in refugees, donated goods and supplies, or otherwise provided assistance to storm victims, including the cities of Arcadia, Fort Myers, Haines City, Jacksonville, Sarasota, Sebring, St. Petersburg, Tampa, and Winter Haven, as well as Dade (today Miami-Dade), Indian River, Polk, St. Lucie, and Volusia counties. In Dade County, the Miami Red Cross Citizens Relief Committee was established. It provided aid for victims of the storm by transporting \\"hundreds of loaves of bread, gallons of milk, pounds of coffee and sugar, blankets, cots, and medical supplies.\\" The Red Cross, in collaboration with the Extension Division of the United States Department of Agriculture, provided seeds, fertilizer, feed, and gasoline and oil for farmers suffering severe losses. About 150 Fordson tractors were disabled by water damage to their ignitions or other parts. The Ford Motor Company, the manufacturer of the tractors, sent two trucks of parts and two mechanical experts from their plant in Jacksonville. Additionally, the Palm Beach County Farm Loan Fund. After collecting about $100,000, farmers were eligible for $300 loans with at a 5% interest rate. The Red Cross established 22 canteens and emergency feeding centers. By October 28, 10,172 families registered and applied for aid with the Red Cross, about two-thirds of whom resided in Palm Beach County. Many donations to the Red Cross in New York came after New York City mayor Jimmy Walker and President Calvin Coolidge bought a full-page advertisement in The New York Times. Overall, individual contributions to the Red Cross reached almost $5.9 million, while the organization itself spent about $50,000 on relief efforts. Red Cross expenditures included about $121,200 for agricultural supplies and equipment, $39,800 for boarding and lodging of storm victims, $157,300 for building and repairs, $137,000 for clothing, $66,800 for grants to local chapters, $115,500 for family aid and service registration, $115,000 for field expensive, $40,000 for food, $83,200 for general tool and equipment expenses, $346,300 for household goods, $5,000 for the junior red cross, $71,800 for medical services, $60,300 for relief camps, $45,900 for rescue work, $11,000 for the transportation of storm victims, and $19,900 for other miscellaneous expenses. The Red Cross was criticized for claims of skimping on aid given to some people and even racial discrimination. Some large families reportedly received as little as $2.Kleinberg, p. 170 In Delray Beach, a woman who completely lost her home, said she was given only \\"a few old pieces of clothes and a few cans of tomatoes and potted meat and a small can of milk for myself and kids.\\" Grace Campbell, a chair of a workers committee, was quoted in The Chicago Defender stating that only 20% of relief was being dispersed to African Americans.Kleinberg, p. 171 A rumor circulated, which even garnered sympathy from Governor Martin, that a black man named Levi Brown was eating ham in a mess tent and was struck in the head and shoulder with an ax by a Red Cross worker, told him \\"ham was not for niggers.\\" Brown himself admitted that he was actually assaulted with a meat cleaver in a restaurant.Kleinberg, p. 173 The claims of partiality were refuted by the Red Cross, the Salvation Army, and Mary McLeod Bethune in a telegraph to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).Kleinberg, p. 172  Burial of bodies  The mass burial site in West Palm Beach The death toll was by far highest in the economically poor areas in the low-lying ground right around Lake Okeechobee, such as Belle Glade, Chosen, Miami Locks, Pahokee, and South Bay. Around 75% of the fatalities were among migrant farm workers, most of whom were African American. The African American men were ordered at gunpoint to collect bodies. One man was shot for refusing to do so. Despite Prohibition laws at the time, those searching and collecting bodies were given rations of bootleg whisky, which was provided by a local rum-runner. Pioneer Lawrence E. Will stated that \\"without the stimulated effect of the whiskey ration, it is doubtful if many would have the stamina to continue.\\"Barnes, p. 137 The body collectors were given gloves that were regularly disinfected. They would tie usually about half a dozen bodies together by the ankle and then load them onto trucks. After a truck departed, the men would then receive their ration of whisky. This process continued day and night until October, while the search for bodies continued until November 1.Neely, p. 277 Due to racial segregation at the time, the coffins provided were used for the white victims, most of whom received a proper burial at Woodlawn Cemetery in West Palm Beach. The bodies of the African Americans who were killed and some of those whose race could not be identified were disposed of by other means. Some were burned in funeral pyres, while many were placed into mass graves, including about 1,600 in Port Mayaca, 674 at the pauper's cemetery, at least 22 in Miami Locks (now known as Lake Harbor), 28 in Ortona, and 22 in Sebring. There were also unconfirmed reports of bodies buried at Loxahatchee. After the burials were complete, then-Mayor of West Palm Beach Vincent Oaksmith proclaimed an hour of mourning on October 1 for those who died during the storm. A funeral service was hosted by several local clergymen and attended by about 3,000 people, including educator Mary McLeod Bethune. A memorial was placed at Woodlawn Cemetery in memory of the victims of the storm, but no such marker was placed at the pauper's cemetery. During the next several decades, the mass African American burial site in West Palm Beach was largely forgotten by the public. The city later sold the property, which switched ownership over the years. In 1991, the property was owned by a private individual when the Sankofa Society conducted a blessing ceremony at the site, well-publicized by the local media. Around that time, Robert Hazard, a resident of West Palm Beach, established the Storm of '28 Memorial Park Coalition Inc. to fight for recognition of the black victims of the storm. In December 2000, the city of West Palm Beach purchased the land back for $180,000. Plans for construction of a memorial began. The site was designated a U.S. National Register of Historic Places and a historical marker was added in 2003 during the 75th anniversary of the hurricane. The inequity has caused ongoing racial friction that still exists. The effects of the hurricane on black migrant workers is dramatized in Zora Neale Hurston's novel Their Eyes Were Watching God. Economic aftermath The Florida land boom was effectively ended by the hurricane. The region was pushed into economic turmoil even before the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the initial stages of the Great Depression. Potential investors and buyers were skeptical about purchasing land in the area. As a result, property values plummeted. In West Palm Beach, for example, real estates costs dropped 53 percent to $41.6 million (1930 USD) between 1929 and 1930 and further to only $18.2 million (1935 USD) by 1935. Prior to the Wall Street Crash of 1929, several hotels in the area declared bankruptcy, attempted to find new investors, or changed names and management. The arrival of the Mediterranean fruit flies in 1929 also contributed to the nearly complete destruction of tourism and citrus in South Florida ‚Äì two vital economic industries in the region. The federal and state government would spend approximately $7 million (1929 USD) in eradication efforts. There were foreign and domestic bans on the importation of fruits and vegetables from Florida. Programs established by the New Deal and efforts by Florida governors in mid and late 1930s, particularly David Sholtz, brought relief to the economic slump, but the region remained in an abysmal financial state until the onslaught of American involvement in World War II. Because of the collapsing economic boom and the publicity surrounding the corrupt real estate deals, the severity of the disaster in Southeast Florida was downplayed. The Tampa Tribune owner Peter O. Knight described the situation as \\"trivial\\".Will, p. 83 The Tampa Board of Trade sent a telegraph to the United States Chamber of Commerce in Washington, D.C., on September 17, informing them that the damage had been \\"exaggerated\\". The board even considered protesting news agencies that write \\"exaggerated\\" reports and warned that there would be requests for retraction. Knight was harshly criticized for marginalizing the disaster, with Palm Beach County Red Cross Chairman Howard Shelby responding with a telegraph stating, \\"If you serve as a spokesman for the entire state, won't you kindly make a personal visit here?\\", while the Okeechobee News called Knight \\"a jackass\\".Kleinberg, p. 164 Herbert Hoover Dike A sign advertising the initial completion of the Hoover Dike To prevent a recurrence of disasters such as the Okeechobee hurricane and the 1926 Miami hurricane, the Florida Legislature created the Okeechobee Flood Control District during its 1929 session, following a recommendation by U.S. Senator Duncan U. Fletcher, among other members of the state's congressional delegation. The Okeechobee Flood Control District authorized to cooperate with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in flood control undertakings. Proposals on other ways to prevent a recurrence of the 1926 and 1928 hurricanes were advanced, including \\"build[ing] a wall down there and keep the military there\\" in order to prevent further settlement in the area or constructing a dike.Will, p. 102 In January 1929, Fred C. Elliott explained during a Congressional hearing that because no state funds were available and state law did not allow for the construction of a dike, Congress was petitioned for funding and authorization. Bror G. Dahlberg, Congressmen Herbert J. Drane and William J. Sears of Florida's 1st and 4th congressional districts respectively, Fred Henry Davis, former Congressman Walter F. Lineberger from California, and U.S. Senator Park Trammell of Florida also testified. Drane stated that he had attempted since 1924 to bring about flood control. After President Herbert Hoover's visit to the area in February 1929, the Corps drafted a new plan which provided for the construction of floodway channels, control gates, and major levees along Lake Okeechobee's shores. A long term system was designed for the purpose of flood control, water conservation, prevention of saltwater intrusion, and preservation of fish and wildlife populations. Congress approved the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1930, signed into law by President Hoover on July 3, 1930. Former President Herbert Hoover speaking at the dedication ceremony in Clewiston for the completion of the dike in 1961 After the initial completion of the dike, Congress reported in 1943 that total expenditures reached at least $23 million (1943 USD), $19 million of which was for the original construction.Will, p. 110 The dike was expanded further after flooding during a series of intense hurricanes in the late 1940s, such as the 1947 Fort Lauderdale hurricane, as well as the passage of the Flood Control Act of 1948. The dike was complete in 1961. A ceremony held in Clewiston on January 12, 1961, included a speech from former President Herbert Hoover. Since its completion, the dike almost completely encloses the lake.Will, p. 109 The only gap is at Fisheating Creek ‚Äì the mouth located in Glades County near Lakeport ‚Äì where the dike turns inland and parallels the stream on both sides for several miles, leaving Fisheating Creek as the only remaining free-flowing tributary of Lake Okeechobee.Lodge, p. 113 Since at least the 1990s, concerns related to the dike's stability have grown in response to studies indicating long term problems with \\"piping\\" and erosion. Leaks have been reported after several heavy rain events. Proposed solutions to the dike's problems have included the construction of a seepage berm on the landward side of the dike, with the first stage costing approximately $67 million (2008 USD). Several refurbishment projects occurred throughout the years. More recently, from 2007 to 2016, the Army Corps of Engineers spent $500 million (2016 USD) on improvements, including building of a reinforcement wall inside the dike. In August 2016, the Army Corps of Engineers proposed a $830 million (2016 USD) plan to revamp the dike, today considered one of the United States' most at risk of failing.

When Yeung refuses to give in, and threatens to kill Cho on the spot, the soldiers declare that Yeung must release Cho in the morning, or else the entire town will be killed. Two of the soldiers' commanders worry about Cho, and attempt to lead a squad in a rescue mission at night, to attack the prison and set Cho free, but the militia members successfully repel them. The richest man in town, Mr Liu, who recently hired private security guards, sends them to murder Yeung and his best friend, so he can take control of the town and set Cho free. While Yeung's friend is killed, Yeung manages to defeat Liu's men. When Yeung tries to arrest Liu, the entire town protests and pleads with Yeung to liberate Cho, and thereby spare the town from massacre. Yeung does not wish to comply, and resigns instead, and disbands the militia. However, in the morning, when Cho's soldiers arrive and free him, they begin plundering the entire town and killing civilians indiscriminately. Yeung, his wife, and his few remaining followers fight back by bombing the soldiers' camp, setting traps within the town, and arming the surviving townsfolk so they can retaliate. In the end, Cho is killed, and when his father leads the main army in a revenge mission against Pucheng, it happens that Pucheng's own army returns and defeats Cho's father in a pitched field battle. Cho's father personally dies. Law and order is restored for a time, while the film goes on to question the privileges of the upper class and the true nature of justice even today.

It is hypohamiltonian, which means that it does not itself have a Hamiltonian cycle but every graph formed by removing a single vertex from it is Hamiltonian. It is also planar. History Hypohamiltonian graphs were first studied by Sousselier in Probl√®mes plaisants et d√©lectables (1963). In 1967, Lindgren builds an infinite sequence of hypohamiltonian graphs. He first cites Gaudin, Herz and Rossi, then Busacker and Saaty as pioneers on this topic. From the start, the smallest hypohamiltonian graph is known: the Petersen graph. However, the hunt for the smallest planar hypohamiltonian graph continues. This question was first raised by V√°clav Chv√°tal in 1973. The answer is provided in 1976 by Carsten Thomassen, who exhibits a 105-vertices construction, the 105-Thomassen graph. In 1979, Hatzel improves this result with a planar hypohamiltonian graph on 57 vertices : the Hatzel graph. This bound is lowered in 2007 by the 48-Zamfirescu graph.

It was published for the first time in the November, No.11 issue of Oktyabr magazine and released as a book by Gosizdat in 1930. The play premiered at the People's House's Drama Theatre, in Leningrad on January 30, 1930. The \\"6-act drama with the circus and the fireworks\\" (according to the subtitle), satirizing bureaucratic stupidity and opportunism under Joseph Stalin, evoked strong criticism in the Soviet press, particularly from the Russian Association of Proletarian Writers. Background Mayakovsky started working upon The Bathhouse right after his return to Moscow from France on 2 May 1929. As well as its predecessor, The Bedbug, this one in retrospect is seen as a logical continuation of Mayakovsky‚Äôs late 1920s satirical cycle; several of its themes and sub-plots have been taken from the shorter poems of 1926-1929. \\"[The play's] political agenda is fighting the narrow-mindedness, opportunism, bureaucratism, and paving the way for heroism, the tempo increase, for the Socialist perspectives,\\" the author told Literaturnaya Gazeta in a 1929 interview. History The Bathhouses rough version was finished in September 1929, but Mayakovsky continued to make changes to the text while performing the play at public recitals. On 22 September he read the play at home to a circle of friends, the next day at the meeting of the Meyerhold Theatre's Arts and politics council. Speaking at the discussion which followed, Vsevolod Meyerhold extolled The Bathhouse, rating it as high as the best work of Moliere, Pushkin and Gogol. \\"[This play] is the greatest phenomenon in the history of the Russian theatre, but we have to applaud Mayakovsky the poet, who's given us the pieces of prose, written as masterfully as the poetry... Without any doubt, Mayakovsky starts [with it] the whole new epoch.\\" The Council's resolution unanimously recommended the play to be produced at the theatre. According to the contract, signed on 5 October, Mayakovsky‚Äôs function at the theatre was to be the director's assistant. Judging by the drawings the author made of Pobedonosikov and Optimistenko characters, he also planned to work as a designer. More public recitals followed: on 27 September (at home in Moscow), 12 October (the State Academic Chapel hall, Leningrad), 13 October (Moskovsky-Narvsky House of Arts, Leningrad), 20 October (Press House, Leningrad), 25 October (Polytechnic Museum), 27 October (the Press House, Moscow). Mayakovsky performed for the workers‚Äô audiences in factories, including Moscow's 1st Exemplary Typography (30 October), Krasny Luch (9 November), Proletary (4 December) and Icarus (28 December). Speaking to the audience of the Moscow 1st Typography on 30 October, Mayakovsky commented upon the question of whether the play has been now fully complete: \\"I never regard any of my work as complete and final 'monument to myself', as it were. I firmly believe in the creative forces of the working class, I come to [the workers' audience] get some help regularly... I receive criticism of different sort, and try to find use for all of these critical remarks.\\"Makarov, V., Zakharov, A., Kosovan, I. Commentaries to The Bathhouse. The Works by Vladimir Mayakovsky in 6 volumes. Ogonyok Library. Pravda Publishers. Moscow, 1973. Vol.VI, pp.315-318 On 20 December Mayakovsky read The Bathhouse at the Narkompros' repertoire committee and took part in the discussion that followed. Serious problems with censorship arose, though, and the play was approved for production only on 9 February 1930, on condition that some of the episodes would be \\"softened\\". All the while Mayakovsky, deeply involved in the rehearsals at the Meyerhold Theatre, was changing the text of the play continuously. Not all these changes have made their way into the printed edition of the play; the manuscript of this extended stage version of the text has been lost. Productions Director Vsevolod Meyerhold rated the play exceptionally high. In March 1930 he tried to defend Mayakovsky, whom Pravda accused of supporting the Leftish slant The play premiered on 30 January 1930 at the People's House's Drama theatre in Leningrad, directed by Meyerhold's student Vladimir Lyutze, with Boris Babochkin in the leading role. Among those present was Mikhail Zoshchenko, who in 1933 remembered: \\"The play was received with deadly coldness. Not a burst of laughter, not a single clap in the course of the first two acts. Never in my life have I witnessed a flop so heavy.\\"Zoshchenko, Michail. The Popular Art Almanac. Leningrad, 1933, p. 7 The Bathhouse premiered at the Meyerhold Theatre on 16 March 1930, with Maxim Shtraukh as Pobedonosikov and Zinaida Reich as the Phosphorescent Woman. The musical score for the show was written by Vissarion Shebalin. One of the junior cast members (playing reporter Momentalshchikov) was Valentin Pluchek who in 1953 produced The Bathhouse at the Moscow Satire Theatre. Again, the audience remained largely unmoved. Actor Igor Ilyinsky remembered in 1958: \\"I saw Vladimir Vladimirovich at the Meyerhold Theatre premier... After the performance which was received not particularly well by the public, Mayakovsky, who felt [his failure] acutely, stood in the lobby all by himself, looking each and every person who was leaving the theatre straight into the eye.\\" On 17 March The Bathhouse was shown at the Leningrad's Tovstonogov Bolshoi Drama Theater, directed by Pavel Weisbrem, with Sergey Balashov as Pobedonosikov. All three productions evoked stormy criticism in the Soviet press (a lone exception being the 8 April 1930 Pravda article by V.Popov- Dubovskoy). Such hostile reaction dealt a heavy blow to the author and apparently contributed to his submerging into deep depression. The Bathhouse was performed ‚Äì by the Meyerhold Theatre during its tour in Povolzhye (1930), and the Tovstonogov Theatre in Belorussia and Ukraine (1930), but by 1931 the play has been dropped from both theatres repertoire, as, after its author's suicide the four-year 'silent obstruction' campaign got started in the Soviet press, which Lilya Brik put a dramatic end to in 1935 with her daring personal letter to Stalin. On 19 July 1951, on the day of Mayakovsky's 58th birthday, the Ruben Simonov-produced version of the play (featuring Igor Ilyinsky as Pobedonosikov) was broadcast on the Soviet Radio. Its massive success had a snowball effect, several major productions followed in 1952-1953 which marked the \\"second birth\\" of The Bathhouse in the Soviet theatre. Characters * Pobedonosikov, the chief of the Directing the Coordination process department. * Polya, his wife * Pont Kitch, the foreigner (‚Üì) * Optimistenko, Pobedonosikov's secretary * Isak Belvedonsky, portraitist, naturalist, batalist * Momentalshchikov, reporter * Nochkin, embezzler * Chudakov, inventor * Velosipedkin, light cavalry man * Madame Mezalyansova, interpreter * Foskin, Dvoikin and Troikin, workers * Ivan Ivanovich, minor official * The Phosphorescent Woman * The chairman of the House Committee (‚Üë) Pont Kitch's speeches look like indecipherable nonsense, but they are an elaborate linguistic experiment in which the English phrases are compiled with the phonetically similar Russian words. The translator Rita Rait who helped Mayakovsky, remembered in her memoirs: \\"Mayakovsky said: 'We have to come up simultaneously with an English word and the Russian one, constructed on the base of it. For example, 'is very well' in Russian would be 'i zver revel' ('and a beast was roaring') [...] Thus from 'do you want' emerged 'dui Ivan' ('blow, Ivan'), 'plenty' turned into 'plyunte' ('spit'), 'just mean' - into 'jasmine', 'I understand' - into 'Indostan' ('Hindustan'), 'I say if' - into 'Aseyev' (the surname). Some words were used in their Russian transcriptions: 'sleep' - 's lip' ('from linden-trees'), 'to go' - 'tugo' ('tight'), 'swell' - 'svel' ('brought together')...\\"Rait, Rita. For Mayakovsky. Memoirs and Articles. Goslitizdat. Leningrad, 1940, p. 125. Synopsis In 1930 the inventor Chudakov creates the Time machine, but experiences great difficulties, having to face the Soviet bureaucracy, mainly in the face of Pobedonosikov, an archetype bureaucrat. The Phosphorescent Woman arrives from 2030 (sent by the Institute of Studying of the History of Communism) and invites to her time and space every single person who's got at least some virtue. As the expedition starts into the Communist future, Pobedonosikov and other 'baddies' get thrown off the Machine, ejected by the Time itself. Critical reception RAPP, who led the 1930 anti-Bathhouse campaign All three premiere performances of The Bathhouse in Leningrad and Moscow evoked stormy criticism in the Soviet press. According to Krasnaya Gazeta, the issue of bureaucratism in it was \\"handled... superficially and one-sidedly,\\" the play's fantasies being \\"abstract and bloodless.\\" \\"The audiences remained emotionally cold and were indifferently trying to follow the plot which in itself occasionally is muddled,\\" wrote a reviewer.Krasnaya Gazeta, 31 January 1930, the evening edition In his bid to expose this vice, Mayakovsky \\"failed to provide the class analysis of the bureaucratism‚Ä¶ The People House's Drama Theatre's production by V. Lyutse proved to be uninventive and only aggravated the author's fallacies,\\" Leningradskaya Pravda (2 February) argued. \\"Boredom rules in the People's House at the performance of The Bathhouse by Mayakovsky. You just sit there and wait until all this ends. The audience is cold as ice... The play's main issue, bureaucratism, is approached in a primitive way, and no flight of fantasy can save this politically vapid thing... The production (director Lyutse) has failed to improve the play, engaged in experimenting with form for the form's sake, without much thought for content,\\" wrote Smena on 5 February. On 9 March, a week before the Moscow premiere, Pravda published Vladimir Yermilov's article \\"On the Petty Bourgeois Leftism in our Fiction\\" where, on the strength of just one published fragment he accused the author of supporting \\"the Leftish slant\\". Meyerhold in the 13 March issue of Vechernyaya Moskva defended Mayakovsky and his play. On 17 March Yermilov in an article called \\"Three Mistakes of Comrade Meyerhold\\" reinstated his position. Mayakovsky responded by coming up with a slogan hung in the theatre's hall during the performance, which read: \\"You won't steam off the bureaucrats' hordes at once / There won't be bathhouses, or soap enough / Besides, bureaucrats are being supported / by critics like Yermilov\\". The RAPP leadership demanded that the slogan should be removed, and it was. Yermilov was mentioned in Mayakovsky's suicidal note as the one he would have liked to \\"see through this raw with.\\"In 1953 Yermilov conceded he'd \\"failed to recognize the positive aspects of Bathhouse.\\" - Yermilov, V., Some Problems of the Soviet Drama. Sovetsky Pisatel, Moscow, 1953, pp. 43, 44 The 16 March performance at the Meyerhold Theatre was followed by the second wave of criticism in the Soviet press. On 21 March Rabochaya Gazeta wrote: > It is impossible to believe in Mayakovsky's dream because he himself does > not believe in it himself. All these \\"time machines\\" and \\"phosphorescent > women\\" are nothing but a noisy twaddle. And his scornful attitude towards > our reality in which he sees nobody but the ignorant chatterboxes, > narcissistic bureaucrats and the 'passers-by', is quite telling...

In Serbia, they mainly began with 1, 2 or 3, in Croatia 4 or 5, in Slovenia 6, Bosnia 7, in Montenegro 8 and in Macedonia 9. On 1 October 1993, the +38 code was broken up and the first digit of each area code integrated into each country's new country code (for example, Macedonia's (now North Macedonia) country code became +389). The numbers were also changed in some countries. For example, the Skopje's call prefix (091) 12 3456 became (02) 12 3456, then (02) 312 3456. Serbia and Montenegro, however, shared the +381 code until 2006, when Montenegro was given the +382 code by its independence. The +388 code was not used by Montenegro, but for the European Telephony Numbering Space. The +380 code was assigned to Ukraine. After negotiations, in 2015 the +383 code was assigned to Kosovo, which until then had used Serbian, Monegasque and Slovenian telephone networks. The +384 code remains unassigned. Exchange codes could not begin 0 or 9 due to the trunk prefix and emergency numbers, respectively.

Solis is a member of a prolific Puerto Rican boxing family, his brothers being former WBA and Ring Magazine world Bantamweight champion Julian Sol√≠s, former WBC world Junior Lightweight title challenger Rafael Solis and Santos Solis, who once fought Wilfred Benitez as a professional and went ten rounds with him. He is from Caimito, Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico. Professional boxing career Kiko Solis made his professional boxing debut on February 19, 1972 at the Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan, defeating the also debuting Samuel Feliciano by first-round knockout. He followed that initial victory with an April 15 points win over Lecardo Millan, another debuting fighter. On May 13, Solis tasted defeat as a professional for the first time, when facing debutant Santiago Rosas, who outpointed him over four rounds at San Juan. A rematch with Rosas was held in Ponce on July 8, and Solis was knocked out in round four. Solis took off almost a year after the second loss to Rosas but re-emerged in the last seven months of 1973 fighting five times during that span, going 3-1-1 in those bouts, defeating 1-5 Gilberto Mendez on May 12 by a fourth-round knockout at the Country Club Stadium in Carolina, debuting Rolando Martinez by six-round decision at Isabela on July 14, and 8-2 Enrique Alonso by a ten-round decision November 30 at San Juan. He lost to 3-5-1 Tony Tris by split eight-round decision on August 21 in San Juan, and drew (tied) with Adriano Marrero, who'd later challenge Antonio Cervantes for the Colombian's WBA world Junior Welterweight title, over eight rounds at San Juan on October 24. Solis' two 1974 bouts were significant because they were against Benjamin Ortiz, another Puerto Rican and who also fought multiple world class fighters. For their first bout, Ortiz came in with a 13-7 record. On March 3, Solis outpointed Ortiz over six rounds in San Juan, but on their rematch, June 26, Ortiz, by then 14-9, avenged that loss by a ten-round decision at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum also in San Juan. Kiko Solis' 1975 professional boxing campaign included four bouts, in which he went 1-2-1 with one knockout. On April 12, he dropped a ten-round decision in San Juan to 14-4-2 local prospect Santos Luis Rivera; on July 28, he beat the mismatched Benito Estrella, 0-5-1, by knockout in round eight at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum; on September 20 he made his first fight abroad when losing by knockout in eight rounds to undefeated, 9-0 Oscar Arnal at the Nuevo Circo in Caracas, Venezuela and on November 17, he drew over ten rounds with 8-14 Andres Torres in San Juan. Solis had four bouts in 1976, each against the same opponent: he and trial horse Francisco Cruz met on January 3, January 18, April 5 and June 5, each time at San Juan. Cruz was 5-10 before their first match, 5-11 before their second, 5-12 before their third and 5-14 before their fourth. Each time Solis won by ten-round decisions. Solis only had two bouts in 1977, but they were important ones: on July 11, he outpointed 28-1, world ranked Hector Medina over ten rounds at San Juan. This win propelled him to a top-ten ranking among the Featherweights by the WBA. The win against Medina allowed Solis to have a chance at fighting former WBA world Featherweight champion Alexis Arguello, who'd later add two more world titles and be inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame. Arguello was by this time attempting to win a world Junior Lightweight title and was 51-4 coming into their fight. Solis went up in weight to the Junior Lightweight division for this bout, held at Somoza Stadium in Managua, Nicaragua on December 18. Solis was dropped twice in round five, the fight being stopped shortly thereafter. On January 28, 1978, as part of the Arguello-Alfredo Escalera I's undercard, Solis faced Panamanian Diego Alcala, 27-10-2, with view of facing the Arguello-Escalera bout's winner for the WBC world Junior Lightweight title, in a fight held at Bayamon, Puerto Rico. Alcala, however, outpointed Solis over ten rounds. Solis then returned to the Featherweight division, where he had a pair of points wins over two debutant fighters, Frank Morales in eight rounds on February 14 at San Juan, and Frank Moncada over ten rounds on August 26 at Carolina. After this, Solis was given his world title chance. World title fight On November 27, 1978, Solis found himself challenging Eusebio Pedroza, a world-traveling World Boxing Association's Featherweight champion of the world, in a 15-round bout for the Panamanian's world championship at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan. Solis gave a good account of himself against the 19-3 Pedroza, winning a few rounds on each of the three judges' scorecards, but he still lost a unanimous, albeit relatively close, decision after 15 rounds by the scores of 147-144, 148-141 and 147-145, all in favor of Pedroza, who'd later join Arguello in the International Boxing Hall of Fame as a member. Solis followed his title try with three more losses, to form a four fight losing streak. Among them, he lost to 22-9-2 Abdul Bey on June 12, 1979 at the Blaisdell Center in Honolulu, Hawaii-his first fight in the United States-an October 19 loss to 10-0 Patrick Ford for the Fecarbox regional Featherweight title at Georgetown, Guyana by ten-round decision, and a ten-round split decision defeat to 21-2 Mike Ayala at the Madison Square Garden's Felt Forum in New York, New York on November 23 (in 1986 his brother Julian would also lose a ten-round split decision to Ayala). Enrique Solis returned his name to the winning column on his next fight, when he faced Felix Trinidad Sr. on December 18 in San Juan, knocking out the former Puerto Rican national Featherweight titlist in round nine. Solis took 1980 off but returned in 1981 to defeat 9-7-3 Heriberto Olivares by a ten-round decision in San Juan, after which he was granted a shot at the USBA's Super Featherweight title against the undefeated, 17-0 John Verderosa. The Verderosa-Solis bout took place on June 4, 1981, also at the Felt Forum in New York. Solis lost a twelve-round unanimous decision and decided to retire afterwards. He returned for one fight in 1983, losing to 12-2-1 Margarito Marquez on January 14 by fourth-round knockout at Chicago, Illinois. This was Solis' last fight as a professional boxer. Solis had a record of 16 wins and 14 losses, with 4 knockout wins.

Roach was involved in high explosives physics research connected with the Manhattan Project and later with NICAP and the Condon Committee as part of ufology. Biography Roach was born in Jamestown (now known as Jamestown Charter Township), Ottawa County, Michigan, fifteen miles southwest of Grand Rapids to his optometrist father Richard Franklin Roach (1878-1939)Roach, Musings, p. 11. and his mother, a housewife, Ingeborg \\"Belle\\" MathildeRoach, Musings, p. 15. Torgerson (1878-1957). Franklin Roach died two days before reaching age 88. Franklin was a Boy Scout as a youth reaching the rank of First Class while participating in a Scout Troop in Wheaton, Illinois under the direction of his father who was its Scoutmaster. Roach attended in 1919-1921 his first two years of secondary education at Wheaton High SchoolThe site of the original Wheaton Grade School and Wheaton High School housed in the same physical building constructed in 1874 and in operation with classes in 1876 is now known as Longfellow Elementary School in Wheaton, Illinois. in Wheaton, Illinois. This was followed by his final two years with graduation in 1923 from Benjamin Franklin High School in Los Angeles, California while residing in the Highland Park region of that city from 1921-1923. Roach had three siblings: Laurance (c1909/1910-1993), Alice (-1995), and Richard (-1982). Roach is buried in Boulder, Colorado. Rayleigh Unit The Rayleigh Unit is a unit of photon flux used to measure the radiance of air glow, atmospheric phenomena like auroras, and integrated starlight of various forms in space. The Rayleigh Unit was first proposed in 1956 by Donald M. Hunten, Franklin E. Roach, and Joseph W. Chamberlain and named by them for Robert John Strutt, 4th Baron Rayleigh (1875‚Äì1947) who first discovered the glow of the night sky. The symbol for the unit is R, also like the unrelated Roentgen unit. Fulbright Scholar Franklin Roach spent a year in Paris in 1951-2 on a Fulbright Fellowship investigating night-sky research.Obituary, Osterbrock, BAAS, p. 1609. Roach also worked with a European pioneer, Daniel Barbier, in this same field. Encounter with Struve Roach, who had a gentle personality, worked early in his career with Otto Struve. Struve had an abrasive personality, and spared no words upon his victims. Struve encouraged the removal of the existing Director of Yerkes Observatory and facilitated his own appointment to the same position, despite Frost originally inviting Struve to come to Yerkes when Struve at that time only spoke Russian and was destitute in Turkey and Greece after escaping the Russian Revolution. On July 1, 1932 Struve succeeded Edwin Brant Frost as Director of Yerkes Observatory. Roach, a graduate student at Yerkes in an office on that date, had the following encounter with Struve while measuring a spectogram authorized by the existing Director Frost earlier that morning: *Version in Yerkes:Osterbrock, Yerkes, p. 131.From communication (letter?) of Roach to Osterbrock, dated May 30, 1991, as noted in Yerkes book.Œ≤ Lyrae = Beta Lyrae. *Version in Musings:Roach, Musings, pp. 77-78.Frost was well loved in the community and is still remembered to this day; Struve is not. Frost had allowed Roach to review the spectrum of Beta Lyrae as, probably unbeknownst to Roach, Frost had studied this particular star and wrote a paper on it which was published in 1895 earlier on in Frost's career. Book Contributions Roach wrote most or contributed in part to several important books. Two elucidating on the subject of airglowAirglow as a term involves three types. During the day airglow is known as \\"dayglow\\"; at night as \\"nightglow\\"; or in connection with the gegenschein as either \\"counterglow\\" or \\"countershine\\" as part of the zodiacal light. would serve as foundation volumes in the field of upper atmosphere science: Aurora and Airglow edited by B. M. McCormac, and The Light of the Night Sky. Another one with a scientific approach to ufology in the early 1970s would serve as a foundation volume for that field of exploratory science: UFO's: A Scientific Debate edited by Carl Sagan and Thornton Page. On the general front, he would write the chapter \\"Aurora and Airglow\\" in the Scientific American book The Planet Earth for the popular audience. The Light of the Night Sky While still associated with \\"Rutgers, The State University\\" in Newark, New Jersey and the University of Hawaii in Honolulu, Hawaii Roach served as the principal author, along with co-author Janet L. Gordon (then working for and associated with the Bernice P. Bishop Museum in Honolulu), in a successful book which served as an important early volume in the series Geophysics and Astrophysics Monographs. Gordon proofread and edited Roach's work, and wrote the historical sections to provide further context. Gordon was married with Roach later in 1977. The volume was published in December 1973 and became the fourth volume in this international series of fundamental monograph textbooks on the subjects of geophysics and astrophysics. Roach's and Gordon's volume was entitled The Light of the Night Sky and dealt with the subject of the composition of the lighted sky itself in the topical subject area \\"the light of the night sky\\" (LONS). It gave scientific presentations with a fundamental overview of the atmospheric processes and interstellar physics involved, especially on Earth's nightside. The preface was prepared in August 1973 and Roach was still writing later chapters in September. Topics discussed included the dark adaptation of the eye, star counts and the distribution of starlight over the sky, the polarization of the \\"Zodiacal Light\\", and the study of \\"The Gegenschein\\". Further discussions concerned whether the nightglow was a static or dynamic phenomena, the sources or causes of nightglow, the photochemical reactions in Earth's upper atmosphere, the appearance of the nightglow from space in Earth's exosphere and geocorona. The book also dealt with the polar aurora, auroral arcs, the varying brightness of the \\"Nightglow Layer\\" depending on zenithal distance, dust-scattered starlight, the diffuse galactic light, dust in the interplanetary and interstellar environment concerning the \\"Zodiacal Dust Cloud\\", and interstellar dust. The text ended with a summation concerning the cosmic light between galaxies and the contemplative topic of cosmology. Awards Gold Medal. Becoming a world authority in auroral studies and airglow, Franklin travelled to Washington, D.C. in early 1961 to be honored as the recipient of the Gold Medal of the U.S. Department of Commerce for his \\"outstanding contribution to upper atmosphere physics by means of studies of optical emission from the night sky\\".Eloise Blakslee Roach notation; Roach, Musings, p. 156.

The adjacencies between regions of this map form the Poussin graph, partially four-colored with the outer region uncolored. The blue‚Äìyellow and blue‚Äìgreen Kempe chains (yellow and green lines) connect the outer region's neighbors, so Kempe would swap colors in the left red‚Äìyellow chain and the right red‚Äìgreen chain (red lines), allowing the outer region to be red. As the blue‚Äìyellow and blue‚Äìgreen chains cross, this color swap would cause the upper yellow and green regions to both become red, producing an invalid coloring. In graph theory, the Poussin graph is a planar graph with 15 vertices and 39 edges. It is named after Charles Jean de la Vall√©e-Poussin.

Bookshelves in the mosque library. Imam Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab Mosque (also called the Qatar State Mosque) is the national mosque of Qatar. It is named after Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, a Sunni Muslim preacher, scholar and theologian from the Najd region in central Arabia, founder of the Islamic doctrine and movement known as Wahhabism. The mosque was opened in 2011, with the Emir of Qatar presiding over the occasion. Architecture The mosque is built in traditional Arab style with modern features. The mosque covers a total area of 175,164 sq.m. As many as 11,000 men can offer prayers in the air-conditioned central hall of the mosque and the adjacent special enclosure is spacious enough for 1200 women. There are three main doors and 17 side entrances to the mosque. As many as 28 large domes cover the central hall while 65 domes cover the outer quadrangle. On the whole the mosque can hold a congregation of 30,000 people. Controversy In 2012, the mosque banned children from entering the mosque during tarawih prayers in the month of Ramadhan. This resulted in parents arguing with security staff. A female worshiper accompanying a toddler complained that they were turned away from sunset prayers (when the mosque was fairly empty). When she protested, she was offered a prayer rug and shown to a corner near the ablution room, but was still not allowed to go upstairs to pray. Male worshipers had similar complaints. In 2013 the ban was reinstated, causing further outrage among mosque attendees. Mohamad al-Arefe said that Syria jihad is incumbent and did apologia for the militant Islamist group al-Nusra Front, visiting the Imam Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab Mosque. Zaghloul El-Naggar engaged in 9/11 denial and spoke twice in the Imam Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab Mosque.

On 2 October 2013 at the Imam Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab Mosque, Sa'ad Ateeq al-Ateeq again called for their destruction of Christians and Jews and called for Muslims and Islam to be exalted. On February 2014 the Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs (Qatar) tweeted that the Imam Muhammad ibn Abd al- Wahhab Mosque was hosting another sermon by al-Ateeq. On 6 July 2014 during Ramadan, al-Ateeq preached at the Imam Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab Mosque. on 9 July 2014 al-Ateeq also gave another Ramadan sermon at the Imam Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab Mosque. Sa'ad Ateeq al-Ateeq has called for the destruction of Shias, Christians, Nusayris (Alawites), and Jews and called for Muslims and Islam to be exalted in the Imam Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab Mosque on January 2015. This was advertised on the website of the Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs (Qatar) and on the official Twitter account of the Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs (Qatar) His January 2015 sermon in the Imam Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab Mosque was advertised by al-Ateeq on his twiter. The Foundation for Defense of Democracies The Daily Beast, and Foreign Policy magazine have run articles on Al-Ateeq and his views, with Foreign Policy having compiled a large documentation of his government sponsored activities at this Mosque. In 2017 there has been a request published on the Saudi Arabian newspaper Okaz signed by 200 descendants of Ibn Abd al-Wahhab to change the name of the mosque, because according to their statement \\"it does not carry its true Salafi path\\", even though most Qataris adhere to Wahhabism.

The package helped to decrease the infant mortality rates (IMR) in Finland and the goal is that the Thula Baba Box would be able to do the same in South Africa. History The Thula Baba Box project was initiated by Stellenbosch parents Ernst Hertzog and Frans De Villiers. They came up with the idea to develop a Maternity package, similar to the kit granted by the Finnish social security, and to introduce it into the newly proposed national health insurance system of South Africa by 2020. Package The box contains baby products, information brochures on babies, baby clothes, washing items, basic medicine, toys, and other items. The box further doubles up as a cot the newborn baby can sleep in. It is aimed at providing a safe sleeping environment for the baby. It has been shown that providing the infant with his/her own bed, instead of sleeping with the parent, helps reduce the risk of death due to suffocation or falling in between the mattress and the headboard. African relevance Many African women and their newborns do not have access to health care during the early postnatal period, putting them at an increased risk of illness and death. Each year, 310,000 fewer newborns would die in Africa and many maternal deaths could be preventable if coverage of postnatal care reached 90 percent of women and babies. With the Thula Baba Box adapted to the South African context it can serve as solid basis for other African nations to re-invent their own versions. South African health targets South African health targets for 2014 include: :* Reducing child mortalities to less than 20 deaths per 1,000 live births :* To decrease the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) to 100 or less per 100 000 live births The Thula Baba Box has the potential to aid the Health Care system achieving these targets in the future. Baby Boxes in popular culture In 2015, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, William and Kate, were given a Baby Box by the Finnish government in celebration of the birth of their second born child, Baby Charlotte. Future A study into the potential social benefits of rolling out the Thula Baba Box is currently underway in the Western Cape, South Africa. The study, which is funded by the private sector and taken on board by the Department of Economics at the University of Stellenbosch, aims to assess the effects on maternal and infant health. The study focuses on mainly the lower-income families of the Western Cape. Detailed design work are expected to proceed once study work has been concluded. It is expected that the Thula Baba Box will be introduced to new mothers at state funded clinics and hospitals in the Western Cape within the next three to five years.

Waterkasteel (Dutch \\"Water Fortress\\") was the northernmost defense of Batavia (now Jakarta), Dutch East Indies. It was located on the west end of the Sunda Kelapa pier. Because of its location, the fort was also known as \\"Hornwerk\\". History The location of the Waterkasteel is visible in the bottom of the map of 18th-century Batavia. The objective of this fortress construction was to provide defense at the entrance of Ciliwung because the anchor points had been moved far away from the fortress due to the formation of shoals in front of the estuary and the widening of the coastline. Construction of the fortress began in 1741, improvements were made later on. In 1745, the fortress was laid on a foundation made of hull-remains soaked in mud. This foundation was not strong enough to hold the fortress walls, and therefore in 1750 this structure was refurbished and reconstructed. In 1776 it was decided to demolish the Waterkasteel. In 1819, the last vestiges of the Waterkasteel was demolished. Construction The Waterkasteel fortress, alternatively called \\"Hornwerk\\", is a relatively small fortress of approximately 142.9 meter in length and 101.5 meter in width. It was made of coral reef, equipped with barracks, armed forces, and a number of cannon. There were 50 spots for cannons along the top of the fortress wall and eight semi-circular lookout towers, which was called \\"Rondeel\\" by local missionary pastor, Johan Maurits Mohr. The fortress contains no buildings. The fort is connected to the mainland by a bridge on the south side of the fortress, This entrance is actually an extension of the west pier embankment (Ciliwung River Embankment). On the southeast bastion, there are two rectangular plots identified as having been the fortress commander's residence and the troop barracks.

She is a winner of the Prix Carbet de la Cara√Øbe et du Tout-Monde. Early life Fabienne Kanor was born in Orl√©ans, France on 7 August 1970. Her mother was a nursing assistant and her father worked in the French post and telegraph office. She obtained degrees in modern literature and sociolinguistics at the University of Orl√©ans and Tours, and went on to study in Paris under Romuald Fonkoua. Her master's thesis was titled La Probl√©matique de la terre dans la litt√©rature antillaise. Career Following her studies, Kanor took up a job at a communications company. At this time she wrote her first novel, which remained unpublished. She then worked as a journalist for television (La Cinqui√®me, Paris Premi√®re, France 3 and Canal France Internationale), radio (Radio France Internationale and Radio Nova), and press (Nova Magazine). These roles allowed her to concentrate on fiction, and also develop as a filmmaker. Between 2001 and 2003, she directed a series of documentaries on black women, including Jenny Alpha, C√©saria Evora and Mimi Barth√©l√©my. Kanor lived for two years in Saint-Louis, Senegal, during which she wrote and published her novel D'Eaux douces. This won the Prix Fetkann! in 2004. Her second novel, Humus, appeared after her sojourn in Benin. This book was inspired by an anecdote in the logbook of a captain of a slave ship in 1774, which reported that fourteen women jumped into the sea rather than proceed into slavery. Ren√©e Larrier noted that \\"Kanor's polyphonic text is part of a series of recent works dealing with women's resistance to involuntary servitude.\\" Between the two novels, she and her sister V√©ronique Kanor began making films. La Noiraude was the first of a planned trilogy of medium-length films, and it explored the trials and tribulations faced by Caribbean people in Paris. It was broadcast on France 2 and RFO, and received well at various film festivals. The second instalment in the trilogy, C'est qui L'Homme, was broadcast on France 2 in 2009. This examined gender dynamics in relationships and the position assigned to women by their male partners. In 2008, Kanor collaborated with Emmanuelle Bidou on Janb√© dlo: une histoire antillaise, a documentary that traced the three stages of Caribbean emigration to France from the perspective of families. In 2011, Kanor participated in the International Writing Program's Fall Residency at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, IA. Kanor's 2014 book Faire l'aventure was praised as a \\"rare book\\", an \\"odyssey of disillusion\\", a chilling exploration of the undocumented life of an illegal immigrant and the \\"venomous relations between white and black people\\".

She is not treating her objects in the usual self-made, rough, unwelcoming way ‚Äì she has a relationship of the best possible care which defines the initial situation, unfolding a network of possible meanings.*Christopher Roth and Georg Diez, Aylin Langreuter, Jovis Verlag, Berlin, 2011, She found herself always lingering between applied and fine arts, producing applied art which you can't apply and design with no practical function, but abstraction of function, making minimal invasive changes that render an object's reality into fiction: the transcendence of the inanimate into something that has psychological or moral conditions. Interested in shape and order, she has always looked for unlikely places. She experimented with the tension that results from tampering with order, reversing it, abstracting it to the point where the result loses all connection with its basis. This way the beauty, the absurdity, or even the humor of an objects gains a new kind of visibility that was lost before the profanity of its function. The observer‚Äôs challenge would be the translation: she considers that only the context of Art, the undemanding, unencumbered space of an exhibition, facilitates the chance of a change of perspective, where in the function-free environment, the gaze meets the object in a way that gives it another life ‚Äì or even: a life.*Andreas Neumeister, Function Follows Fairytale, Blumenbar Verlag, Munich, 2010, Each of her objects presentation is an integral part of the work itself. To achieve this she sometimes \\"borrows\\" from others. She sometimes uses quotations, text fragments, photographs, the peculiarity of a given space, light, graphic elements. It is sometimes this interdisciplinary interaction itself what creates the context that makes the piece work. In a world whose language you don't understand, you have to use whatever you have to make yourself understood.*Lecture on Belgrade Design Week 2013, Aylin Langreuter and Christophe de la Fontaine  Quotations  \\"For the longest time I had the naive notion that art had to be universally and intuitively understood. That any venture into explanation would destroy that effect. That a like mind would recognize the meaning ‚Äì if such existed- and beauty of each piece and with that maybe be able to trace the process that led me to it. And even though I wizened up fast to the universal demand for explanation and clarification, I still hope that sometimes it will work that way.\\"''  Solo exhibitions  * \\"Rundgang\\" (\\"Circuit\\") public exhibition of several works in private apartments, Munich 1998 * \\"Rechne mit Deinen Defekten\\" (\\"Recon with your defects) light-installation, Akademiegalerie, Munich 1999 * \\"No 3\\", olfactoric installation, Maximiliansforum, Munich, 2002 * \\"Namenszug\\" (\\"Inscription\\"), \\"84-69-100\\" Galerie Wittenbrink, Munich 2003 * \\"Werkschau\\", Wittenbrink F√ºnfH√∂fe, Munich 2003 * \\"Erster Teil\\" (\\"Part One\\")catalogue presentation and exhibition, Wiensowski & Harbord, Berlin 2004 * \\"Erster Teil\\" (\\"Part One\\") catalogue presentation and exhibition, Galerie Wittenbrink, Munich 2004 * \\"Lassolicht\\", Neoninstallation, Wittenbrink F√ºnfH√∂fe, M√ºnchen 2005 * \\"nichtmehr/nochnicht\\", RSVP, M√ºnchen 2006 * \\"Sachbilder\\", Galerie Wittenbrink, M√ºnchen 2006 * \\"nichtmehr/nochnicht\\", Westwerk, Hamburg 2006 * \\"F√∂rderkoje\\", Art Cologne, K√∂ln 2007 * \\"√úberblick\\", Sebastian Fath Contemporary, Mannheim * \\"Wiedervorlage\\", Galerie Wittenbrink, Munich, 2008 * \\"Also ob\\", Wittenbrink F√ºnf H√∂fe, Munich, 2009 * \\"function follows fairytale\\", Spazio Rossana Orlandi, Milano, 2010 * \\"function follows fairytale\\", Michelle Nicole Fine Arts, Zurich, 2010 * \\"function follows fairytale\\", catalogue presentation, Villa Stuck, Munich, 2010 * \\"Blindlights and Neonetchings\\", catalogue presentation and exhibition, Galerie Wittenbrink, Munich 2012  Other projects  * \\"Access to Success\\" ( in cooperation with Lea Schmidbauer) conceptual art project, Rieger City, Munich, 2000 * \\"Confession of Depression\\", conceptual art project, Zerwirkgew√∂lbe, Munich 2004 * \\"\\"Davos\\", Installation for the presentation of Patricia Urquiola Rosenthal Service, International furniture fair, Milano, 2008 * \\"bead chain hoods\\", masked ball of the artist group Rothstauenberg, Zurich, 2008 * \\"Monsters\\", living gures for the art project \\"80/81\\" of Christopher Roth and Georg Diez edited by Patrik Frey, Berlin, Zurich and R /India References * Petra Shmidt, The Design Label Dante, Form Design Magazine, August 2014 * Chiara dal Canto, Modern fairytale, Belle, November 2014 * Luigina Bolis, Jump, Corriere della Sera Living, October 2014 * Petra Shmidt, The Design Label Dante, Form Design Magazine, August 2014 * Oliver Herwig, Du bist der Boss, Manual, February 2014 * Lecture on Belgrade Design Week 2013, Aylin Langreuter and Christophe de la Fontaine * Christopher Roth and Georg Diez, Aylin Langreuter, Jovis Verlag, Berlin, 2011, * Heike Endter, Neonstiche, Galerie Wittenbrink, M√ºnchen, 2011 * artist info Aylin Langreuter, about Aylin Langreuter * Andreas Neumeister, Function Follows Fairytale, Blumenbar Verlag, Munich, 2010, * Catalogue Erster Teil, Blumenbar Verlag, Munich, 2004, * damit bin ich gemeint (www.damitbinichgemeint.de), published by Wahnsinn und Methode GmbH, M√ºnchen, 2002 German conceptual artists Women conceptual artists 1976 births Living people 21st-century women artists ","title":"Aylin Langreuter"},{"id":"47091788","text":"Kelley Elizabeth Johnson (born May 6, 1993) is an American nurse, TV host and beauty pageant titleholder.

She competed as one of 15 finalists in the 2014 Miss Iowa pageant on a platform of \\"Raising Awareness About the Importance of Early Cancer Detection\\" and piano playing as her talent. She was a top-10 finalist for the statewide title. Miss America 2016 In November 2014, returning to her state of origin, Johnson was awarded a crown that allowed her to move on to the next round in the competition. She entered the state pageant at Denver's Ellie Caulkins Opera House in June 2015 as one of 26 qualifiers. Johnson's competition talent was a monologue which was correlated to her experience with a patient she had met with Alzheimer's disease. Her platform is \\"The Health Initiative PLUS: Prevent, Live, Uncover, Study\\". Johnson won the competition on Saturday, June 20, 2015, when she received her crown from outgoing Miss Colorado titleholder Stacey Cook.

On September 17, 2015, Johnson appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show to discuss her on-stage question and answer, suggesting DeGeneres should be on the ten-dollar bill and her decision to perform a monologue about nursing for her talent. After her interview, Johnson received $10,000 from Shutterfly to help pay for her tuition for nurse anesthetist school. Miss USA 2018 On December 3, 2017, Johnson was crowned Miss California USA 2018 after representing Redondo Beach in the competition by outgoing titleholder India Williams.

Ichhenodi basically revolves around a story of two sisters, Meghla and Adrija, and how they entangle themselves in a relationship with their love interest, Anurag. Meghla, who finds the essence of her life in music, is fond of her elder sister Adrija, and loves her above anyone else. The sisters get caught up in a love triangle making their life go upside down. Meghla is proud of her elder sister Adrija as she is a smart, beautiful girl, who is a topper as well when it comes to study. However, Adrija despises her since childhood and hates her after she comes to know that Meghla is not her own sister but adopted. Adrija begins to love Anurag madly but Anurag falls in love with the simple and docile Meghla, and her passion for music. Meghla refuses him and tries to convince him to marry Adrija but circumstances compel them to marry each other. Adrija creates many misunderstandings to destroy the marital life of Meghla and Anurag, but their love conquers every time. Adrija even goes to the extent of trying to kill Meghla on many occasions, but in vain. In frustration, she pushes Anurag from a cliff, who is then saved by Tua, also a passionate singer. Anurag loses his memory in the accident and is named \\"Vikram\\" by Tua and her family. Tua starts loving Vikram, without knowing his past. Adrija now marries Piklu, Anurag's cousin and enters his family to torture Meghla and makes her life hell by instigating Malobika against her, rendering Meghla responsible for Anurag's supposed death and portrays Meghla as a cheap and characterless girl in the eyes of the family members.

Life  Della Architettvra. Illustration. Apart from being introduced into building and painting young Antonio Rusconi studied mathematics at the University of Padua under Giovanni Battista Memmo and Niccol√≤ Tartaglia. Extensively consulting Vitruvius‚Äô \\"Ten Books on Architecture\\" while he was constructing a novel type of watermill Antonio became aware of many grave technical errors within the work‚Äôs early Renaissance editions and commentaries. Finally Pietro Lauro, who had rendered Leon Battista Alberti‚Äôs ‚ÄúDe Architectura‚Äù into the vernacular, convinced Rusconi to set out with a translation of his own. The text was finished until 1552 and illustrated with more than three hundred supplementary woodcuts. Earlier, Rusconi had already provided the illustrations for Lodovico Dolce‚Äôs version of the Ovidian ‚ÄúMetamorphoses‚Äù. Yet, since then countless treatises on architecture and commentaries on Vitruvius (e.g. by Daniele Barbaro, Gicaomo Vignola and Andrea Palladio) were being published, Rusconi‚Äôs Venetian editors, Giolito and Tommaso Porcacchi, saw no benefit in printing another title on the subject. Together with Palladio Rusconi draughted the \\"Palazzo municipale\\" (Brescia) in 1562, they also took part in rebuilding the Doge's Palace after the fire of 1577 and constructing the Palazzo Grimani. Nevertheless throughout his life Rusconi‚Äôs main occupation was that of a hydraulic engineer for the Republic of Venice. After having fallen gravely ill in 1575 Giovan Antonio died in 1579.Cf.

Rusconi's \\"Della Architettura\\"  Rusconi‚Äôs ‚ÄúVitruvius‚Äù was only printed after his death in 1590 by the son of his former editor Giolito. Although the latter recognised the value of Giovan Antonio‚Äôs xylographies he considered his translation and annotations as outdated, and thus a strange ‚ÄúVitruvius without Vitruvius‚Äú was published:Cf. Bedon 1996, p. XII: ‚Äûquesta strana edizione vitruviana senza Vitruvio, senza traduzione, senza autore.‚Äú Just about 160 of originally 300 woodcuts were compiled with extracts from Fra Giocondo‚Äôs and Cesariano‚Äôs translations of Vitruvius‚Äô treatise.

At least eight preparatory sketches, gouaches and watercolors of the work have survived, though Portrait of an Army Doctor is one of the only major oil paintings of the period.Peter Brooke, Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1915, from Le Cubisme en majest√©, Albert Gleizes, exhibition catalogue, Mus√©e Picasso, Barcelona; Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts, Lyon, 2001 As other wartime works by Gleizes, Portrait of an Army Doctor represents a break from the first phase of Cubism. These wartime works mark \\"the beginning of an attempt to preserve specific and individual visual characteristics while experimenting with a radically different compositional treatment in which broad planes, angled from the perimeter, meet circles.\\" (Robbins, 1964) Rather than based on the analysis of volumetric objects, the artist strove toward synthesis; something that originated in unity.Peter Brooke, Albert Gleizes: For and Against the Twentieth Century, Yale University Press, 2001, Portrait of an Army Doctor‚Äîearlier forming part of the collection of art dealer L√©once RosenbergAm√©d√©e Ozenfant, Charles-√âdouard Jeanneret (Le Corbusier), La peinture moderne, √âditions G.

The work forms part of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Founding Collection.Solomon R. Guggenheim Founding Collection It was gifted to the museum by Solomon Guggenheim in 1937 (the year of the formation of the foundation). The painting is in the permanent collection of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City. Description Golden section, or Section d'Or (yellow lines), quarter grid (grey lines) and principle geometric structure lines (white lines). Portrait of an Army Doctor is an oil painting on canvas with dimensions inscribed Alb. Gleizes, Toul 1914, lower right. An early photograph of the work shows the inscribed date as 1914‚Äì15. Gleizes's works from this period, just as those of the early 1920s, are \\"characterized by dynamic intersections of vertical, diagonal, horizontal and circular movements\\", writes art historian Daniel Robbins, \\"austere in touch but loaded with energetic pattern.\\" Gleizes brings into practice an effect reminiscent of Divisionist theory via the incorporation of colored squares within three sections of the canvas, one of which is composed of alternating pigments of contrasting blues and reds. The use of blue, white and red in the overall composition recall the colors of the French flag. Such a display of patriotism was not uncommon among the Cubists, even leading up to the war. French flags can be seen in the works of Roger de La Fresnaye; Fourteenth of July, 1913-14 (Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, TX),Roger de La Fresnaye, Fourteenth of July, 1913-14 and The Conquest of the Air, 1913 (Museum of Modern Art, New York).Roger de La Fresnaye, The Conquest of the Air, 1913, 235.9 x 195.6 cm, Museum of Modern Art, New York√âchos artistiques de la conqu√™te de l‚Äôair : Roger de la Fresnay et la modernit√©Eric Hild-Ziem, MoMA, From Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009 The Cubo-Futurist Gino Severini, too, included the French flag in his 1913 painting Train of the Wounded, 1913.Gino Severini, Train of the Wounded, 1913, includes the French flag While not depicting the flag itself, wartime works by Jean Metzinger dominantly exhibit blues and reds, along with army green, in such works as Soldat jouant aux √©checs (Soldier at a Game of Chess), 1914‚Äì15, Smart Museum of Art, and Femme au miroir (Lady at her Dressing Table), April 1916. Albert Gleizes, 1915, Retour de Bois-le-Pr√™tre, wood engraving, 39 x 50 cm, published in Le mot, n. 20, 1 July 1915 In 1915 Gleizes published an article in Jean Cocteau's patriotic review, Le Mot in which he attacks critics who accuse the new tendencies in art of being unpatriotic. The final issue of Le Mot includes a sketch by Gleizes based on wounded soldiers returning from a battle at Bois le Pr√™tre.C‚Äôest en allant se jeter √† la mer que le fleuve reste fid√®le √† sa source, Le Mot, Paris, vol. I, no. 17, 1 Mai 1915Le Mot, n. 20, 1 July 1915, in Gallica, Biblioth√®que nationale de France Despite its descriptive title, the subject matter of Portrait of an Army Doctor has practically disappeared. The canvas is no longer analyzed or structured geometrically according to the golden ratio, though the armrest of the chair is treated as the beginning of a Fibonacci spiral. The masses of the composition are arranged in quasi- equilibrium. The center of the sitter face is the superior vertex of a triangular construct that extends toward the outer edges of the canvas. The intersection of the two arcs that compose the shoulders is centered on the vertical axis. The source of light is undetermined, or omnidirectional, just as the vantage point of the artist, in accord with the Cubist principle of 'simultaneity' (or multiple perspective): \\"a succession of descriptive aspects of the external world... by giving a multiple series of appearances, each one seen in its own perspective\\", writes Gleizes, \\"a succession of descriptive states. Waking up, this eye lurched from one point of view to the other, jumped back again, and was again thrown into a state of excitement.\\"Albert Gleizes, Painting and Representational Perspective, Lecture dated Paris, 22 March 1927, given in the Carnegie Foundation for the French Intellectual Union and published by √âditions Moly Sabata 1927. Republished in Puissances du Cubisme, Eds Pr√©sence, Chambery, 1969. Translation Peter Brooke Cubism, with its new geometry, its dynamism and multiple view-point perspective, not only represented a departure from Euclid's model, but it achieved, according to Gleizes and Metzinger, a better representation of the real world: one that was mobile and changing in time. For Gleizes, Cubism represented a \\"normal evolution of an art that was mobile like life itself\\".

Guggenheim Museum, New York > Multiple perspective was in itself a protest against painting defined as an > art based on space, that is to say, static.

Breaking up the plane into surfaces of > different sizes reduced to geometrical forms. Sometimes certain indications > of figures appear in this assemblage, obtained with the help of a few lines > and several suggestive points. (Gleizes, 1927) While depth perception and perspective have been subdued to a large extent, the primary structural lines appear to recede or converge toward a multitude of vanishing points located at infinity. Though, unlike those of classical perspective, these vanishing points are not placed on a given horizon (a theoretical line that represents the eye level of the observer), nor do they allow the viewer to reconstruct the relative distance of parts or features of an object. Rather, they are placed on various horizons. The viewer is observing a non-linear scene where the picture plane is not parallel to any of the scene's multiple axes, giving the appearance of different forms of calculated perspective. Surfaces appear to overlap creating a sense of occlusion, but the resulting information is insufficient to allow the observer to recreate depth of field. By removing these optical cues, the geometrical method of perspective used to create the illusion of form, space and depth since the Renaissance, the artifice of an illusionistic trickery as Metzinger called it,Jean Metzinger, Le Cubisme √©tait N√©: Souvenirs par Jean Metzinger (Cubism was Born), Pr√©sence, Chamb√©ry, 1972. (This text written by Jean Metzinger was supplied to the publisher Henri Viaud by Metzinger's widow Suzanne Phocas). Translation Peter Brooke Gleizes's aim was to arrive at what he perceived as 'truth', the constructive essence of the physical world. > So, now that we are in possession of the means (and I firmly believe that we > are) we must pitilessly reject the image of the Renaissance that is > addressed exclusively to the senses, but, at the same time, we should not > fear, should the occasion present itself, an image determined by geometry, > by the square, the right angle, because it, in its nature, corresponds to > the higher stages.

A beauty achieved through a > mathematical order can only have a relative life; the universal kaleidoscope > cannot be fitted into the framework of a system...\\" (Gleizes, c.1916, letter > addressed to ) From 1914 to the end of Gleizes's New York period‚Äîhowever nonrepresentational‚Äîworks by the artist continued to be shaped by his personal experience, by the conviction that art was a social function, susceptible to theoretical formulation, and imbued with optimism. Gleizes's nonrepresentational paintings and those with an apparent visual basis existed side by side, differing only, writes Daniel Robbins, in \\"the degree of abstraction hidden by the uniformity with which they were painted and by the constant effort to tie the plastic realization of the painting to a specific, even unique, experience.\\" Background Jean Metzinger, 1914‚Äì15, Soldat jouant aux √©checs (Soldier at a Game of Chess), oil on canvas, 81.3 x 61 cm, Smart Museum of Art Many of the leading Cubists were mobilized at the outset of the First World War: Georges Braque, Fernand L√©ger, Duchamp-Villon, Roger de La Fresnaye, and Jean Metzinger,Christopher Green, Cubism and its Enemies, Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916-1928, Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 1987, pp. 13-47, 215 yet despite the radical interruption, they were able to continue producing styles of Cubism that extended beyond pre-war attitudes. Cubism evolved as a result of both nationalistic pressures and from the evasion of the atrocities of war. There came the need to diverge further away from the representation of things. As the divide between art and life grew, the need for a process of distillation (a process of purification) became increasingly ubiquitous across the spectrum of Cubist activity. Orderly qualities and autonomous purity became a prime concern.Christopher Green, Late Cubism, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009 This tendency toward wholesale geometric abstraction from 1914 through the mid-1920s has been linked to broader ideological shift towards conservatism in both French society and culture. Metzinger served very close to the front during World War I, as a medical aide, and was possibly with his surgical automobile when he painted Soldier at a Game of ChessThe Art of JAMA: Covers and Essays from The Journal of the American Medical Association, Volume 3, M. Therese Southgate, Oxford University Press, Mar 17, 2011 (though evidence suggests the work may have been painted prior to his mobilization).Correspondance √©chang√©e entre L√©once Rosenberg et Jean Metzinger, 25 May 1916, Biblioth√®que Kandinsky, Centre de documentation et de recherche du MNAM/Cci, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris (Metzinger mentions the paintings as titled Joueur d'√©checs) However, very few of his works represent scenes associated with war. And rather than delving into the actual carnage of war, this painting evokes an idealized theory of war. Instead, his interest is captured by mathematical rationality, order, his faith in humanity and modernity. The war, however, is very present in this work, by the presence of the soldier and his engagement with chess, simultaneously an intellectual game and a battle. Fernand L√©ger, 1916, Soldier with a pipe (Le Soldat √† la Pipe), oil on canvas, 130 x 97 cm, Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, D√πsseldorf This period of profound reflection contributed to the constitution of a new mindset; a prerequisite for fundamental change. The flat surface became the starting point for a revaluation of the fundamental principles of painting. Rather than relying strictly on the intellect, the focus placed on the immediate experience of the senses, on the idea according to Gleizes, that form, 'changing the directions of its movement, will change its dimensions', while revealing the \\"basic elements\\" of painting, the \\"true, solid rules - rules which could be generally applied\\".Albert Gleizes, L'Epop√©e, written in 1925, published in Le Rouge et le Noir, 1929.

English translation, The Epic, From immobile form to mobile form by Peter Brooke Fernand L√©ger was mobilized in October 1914, and served as a sapper close to the front in Forest of Argonne. He drew the various activities of his comrades during his free time, with virtually no possibility of working on canvas. Between the autumn of 1914 and 1917 he was able to produce only one work on canvas, Soldier with a pipe (Le Soldat √† la Pipe).Carolyn Lanchner, Fernand L√©ger, Jodi Hauptman, Matthew Affron, Fernand L√©ger: Exhibition, The Museum of Modern Art, New York, February 15-May 12, 1998, The Museum of Modern Art, 1998], Unlike the \\"Impressionism of form\\" and dissection of the subject by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, Gleizes attempted to create a synthetic art that incorporated social values. He strove to capture the absolute 'order' and 'truth' of his subject, believing in the Universality and superiority of rhythmic harmonies over subjective responses. These values had preoccupied the artist since his years at the Abbaye de Cr√©teil, a self-supporting collective of artists and writers he co-founded during the fall of 1906 with Alexandre Mercereau, Ren√© Arcos, Henri-Martin Barzun, and Charles Vildrac.Barzun, Henri-Martin, L'Ere du Drame, Essai de Synth√®se Po√©tique Moderne, Figui√®re, 1912 Mobilization Toul, Caserne Mar√©chal Ney, c. 1915, where Gleizes was stationed during his mobilization Gleizes had been conscripted at the outset of the war (August 1914) and sent to the garrison town of Toul, close to the Eastern front (120 km from Sainte- Menehould, where his close friend Jean Metzinger was mobilized) to serve in the 167e r√©giment d'infanterie (from which the 367e r√©giment d'infanterie was formed). He was stationed in the Caserne Mar√©chal-Ney (Plateau Saint-Georges), attached to the Service de Sant√© des Arm√©es, in the infirmary of the unit.Christian Briend, Revue des Mus√©es de France, N¬∞ 4, 2008 Upon giving his name to the receiving sergeant he was asked if he had any relation to the Cubist painter. When Gleizes answered that he was the Cubist painter he was told to step aside. Sergeant (soon to become a well-known paleontologist) happened to be an avid enthusiast of modern art. Shortly thereafter Gleizes was assigned the role of providing entertainment for the troops. His experience with artistic and literary activities at the Abbey of Cr√©teil and the Association Ernest Renan, along with his connection to the distinguished author and actor Maxime L√©ry, may have helped secure the post. His close associates at the garrison included Carlos Salzedo, a harpist responsible for musical activities; the dentist Th√©o Morinaud, and early childhood friend from Courbevoie and possibly the subject of several pairings by Gleizes, including l'Homme au Balcon (Man on a Balcony), Philadelphia Museum of Art. Also stationed at Toul were the painters Georges Valmier, Paul Colin, and the composer Florent Schmitt. Gleizes activities as artistic and literary impresario at the fortress included monologues reciting classical, romantic and Symbolist poetry by Paul Fort, Jules Laforgue, Tristan Corbi√®re, Arthur Rimbaud and St√©phane Mallarm√©.

Guggenheim Museum Gleizes' mobilization was an obstacle to his production of artwork, though he was able to work on small scale, and ultimately produced one relatively large piece, Portrait of an Army Doctor. > The painter Gleizes, who wrote a book on Cubism, writes to a friend: \\"From > Toul, advanced outpost on the Eastern border, I am sending you this card. > There is no question of Cubism at the moment or simultanism. When will we > speak of it again? When will we do it again? Soon I hope, and with the glory > of having crushed the German felony, having extirpated the Prussian Hydra > and to be able to return freely in French Alsace-Lorraine forever. I have > absolute confidence in your effort, your mission.\\" (Gleizes, > L'Intransigeant, August 1914)L'Intransigeant, Nos Echos, La Bo√Æte aux > lettres, 31 August 1914, p. 2, National Library of France An admirer of his work, his commanding officer‚Äîthe regimental surgeon portrayed by Gleizes in this painting‚Äîmade arrangements so that Gleizes could continue to paint while mobilized at Toul. This work, painted at the outset of the Crystal Cubist period, was a precursor to Gleizes's abstract paintings of 1915‚Äì16. Portrait of an Army Doctor consists of broad, overlapping planes of brilliant color, dynamically intersecting vertical, diagonal, horizontal lines coupled with circular movements. This painting, along with his Portrait de Florent Schmitt, Le Chant de guerre (Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum), according to Gleizes, represented a break from both 'Cubism of analysis', and from the representation of volume undertaken during the first period of Cubism. He was now on a path that lead to 'synthesis', with its starting point in 'unity'.Albert Gleizes, Souvenirs: le Cubisme, 1908-1914, La guerre, Cahiers Albert Gleizes, Association des Amis d'Albert Gleizes, Lyon, 1957, p. 15. Reprinted, Ampuis, 1997, written during the First World War This unity, and the highly crystalline geometricized materialization consisting of superimposed constituent planes, ultimately referred to by the French poet and art critic Maurice Raynal as Crystal Cubism, would soon be described by Gleizes in La Peinture et ses lois (1922‚Äì23), as 'simultaneous movements of translation and rotation of the plane'.Peter Brooke, Painting and Its Laws, Albert Gleizes, La peinture et ses lois, Ce qui devait sortir du Cubisme, Paris 1924 The synthetic factor was taken furthest of all from within the Cubists by Gleizes. Basing himself on his 1915 abstractions, Gleizes sought to clarify his methods further in La Peinture et ses lois, deducing the fundamental principles of painting from the picture plane, its proportions, the movement of the human eye and the universal physical laws. These theoretical postulates, later referred to as translation-rotation, according to Robbins, rank \\"with the writings of Mondrian and Malevich as one of the most thorough expositions of the principles of abstract art, which in his case entailed the rejection not only of representation but also of geometric forms\\". Many drawings, gouaches and watercolors were realized by the artist in and around Toul. He kept the landscapes and portrait sketches in a drawer, until one day they were discover by a private (a miner) who removed them all only to tack them on the wall with toothpicks for an exhibition. Gleizes remarked that educated or cultured soldiers had more difficulty with his paintings than those with little or no intellectual pretensions. Portrait d'un m√©decin militaire generated mixed responses. The Professor of Physiology from the Faculty of Nancy in charge of the infirmary at Toul, Dr. Lambert, was more enthusiastic about his portrait by Valmier than that of Gleizes: > The portrait that he [Valmier] made of the Doctor was excellent, a very good > likeness that remained in the classical idiom. But for myself, I wanted to > remain faithful to Cubism and not to play games with my own convictions. So > the portrait I envisaged was a little surprising for the good doctor's > habits of mind. He did not conceal his way of thinking, but he let me do > what I wanted. I made of him, from memory, a large number of drawings in > pencil, in pen and ink, in ink wash. I made a series of watercolors and > gouaches. When he saw them, the model was pretty shaken. When my studies > seemed to be ready, I did the oil painting. I painted the portrait in the > Marshall Ney's room. I nailed a canvas I had ordered from Nancy to the wall > and got down to work. When it was finished, it received the approval of my > friends, the unsophisticated ones, who were all able to recognise Dr. > Lambert perfectly well. The others were divided. As for the interested > party, he refused, definitely, but amicably, to take possession of it. To > please me, he only accepted the final little gouache which I had used for > the execution of the canvas. (Albert Gleizes, Souvenirs, c. 1942)Denise > Bazetoux, Georges Valmier: Catalogue raisonn√©, Paris, 1993, p.45, No. > 23Albert Gleizes, Souvenirs, unpublished manuscript, Mus√©e National d‚ÄôArt > Moderne, Paris, c.1942-1943, p.7Stephen Ongpin Fine Art, St. James‚Äôs London Doctor Mayer Lambert (1870-1943), Professor of Physiology, Faculty of Nancy The Portrait d'un m√©decin militaire, commissioned by Dr. Lambert, is \\"impressive\\" writes art historian Peter Brooke: :\\"Although Gleizes tells the story lightheartedly, it is a serious, almost tragic painting, in which the subject (the poor Dr. Lambert) has almost disappeared‚Äîreduced to a presence rather than a likeness‚Äîin a construction in which vertical parallel lines, and therefor a static, monumental character, prevail. Together with the second Portrait of Florent Schmitt (the Chant de guerre), it could be described as the furthest point reached by this Cubism striving towards the laws of the 'object'‚Äîthe properties of the picture space itself‚Äîbut still taking the 'subject'‚Äîthe thing represented‚Äîas its starting point.\\" (Brooke, 2001, p. 46) Shortly thereafter, Jean Cocteau asked Gleizes to design the set and costumes for the William Shakespeare play, A Midsummer Night's Dream, along with Valmier. Demobilization Albert Gleizes, Portrait d'un m√©decin militaire reproduced on the cover of the Gleizes catalogue raisonn√©, Vol. 1, Somogy, 1998, Paris Gleizes was demobilized, with the help of his soon to be wife Juliette Roche, in September 1915. Gleizes published an article in Ricciotto Canudo's Montjoie entitled Cubisme et la tradition. It was through the intermediary of Cuando that Gleizes met the artist Juliette Roche. She was a childhood friend of Jean Cocteau and the daughter of an influential politician of the 3rd Republic, Jules Roche.Fondation Gleizes, Chronologie During the months of autumn, following his demobilization in 1915, Gleizes married Juliette Roche and moved to New York. There they were met by Carlos Salzedo, Francis Picabia, Man Ray, Marcel Duchamp, and Jean Crotti (who would eventually marry Suzanne Duchamp). Marcel Duchamp had emigrated to New York several months earlier after being judged physically unfit for his service in the military. Shortly after his arrival, Gleizes, accompanied by Salzedo, frequented jazz clubs in Harlem. With all it had to offer, New York had a strong impact on the artist's production, leading to abstract works virtually free of visual subject matter. Many works by Gleizes painted at Toul between 1914 and 1915 were auctioned in New York, for the occasion of the late John Quinn exhibition and sale of modern and ultra-modern art at the American Art Galleries, conducted by Bernet and Parke, with a catalogue published by American Art Association, New York, 1927.Paintings and sculptures, The renowned collection of modern and ultra-modern art formed by the late John Quinn Recent exhibitions Le cubisme, 17 October 2018 to 25 February 2019, Centre Pompidou, the first large-scale exhibition devoted to Cubism in France since 1973, with over 300 works on display.

During her time in Berlin with the State Theatre company she also made regular guest appearances at the Deutsches Theater, the Lessing Theater and the Schiller Theater, working with leading directors such as Heinz Hilpert and Bertolt Brecht. She married the orchestral conductor Hermann Scherchen in 1927:Hermann Scherchen, Biography, theaterwissenschaft.ch, in German, Retrieved 27 July 2015 they separated soon afterwards, but not amicably. She had affairs, including one with Carl Zuckmayer who referred to her as the Lithuanian vixen on account of her apparent vitality. In 1931 M√ºller married Hans Lohmeyer, the Lord Mayor of K√∂nigsberg.Hans Lohmeyer, Deutsche Biography, (in German), Retrieved 27 July 2015 In January 1933, the Nazi Party took power and systematically switched Germany over to a one-party dictatorship. M√ºller's husband was not a member of the Nazi Party and was suspended from his mayoral duties. Gerda M√ºller also retired to private life during the twelve Nazi years, possibly due to a severe lung infection. Other sources indicate that a stage ban was imposed on her in connection with complications following the non-consensual ending of her earlier marriage with Hermann Scherchen. After the war, the eastern part of Berlin was part of a larger Soviet occupation zone. The Deutsches Theater reopened in September 1945 under the leadership of Gustav von Wangenheim, and Gerda M√ºller was a member of the company. Between 1945 and her death in 1951 she played a succession of leading roles. Shortly before she died she headed the cast in Brecht's Mother Courage.

Built as a cotton plantation in the Antebellum South, it was farmed using the forced labor of African American slaves. After the American Civil War of 1861-1865, freedmen farmed it. From the 1890s to the 1910s, it used convict laborers and employed immigrants from Northern Italy, many of whom were subject to peonage. They were later replaced by black sharecroppers. The plantation was closed down and it was broken up in the 1940s. Nowadays, only a historical marker reminds Lake Village residents and visitors of its history. Antebellum South The land belonged to Native Americans, followed by the French, until Emperor Napoleon sold it to the United States as a result of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. By 1819, the Arkansas Territory was established. A year later, in 1820, slavery became the law of the land as a result of the Missouri Compromise. The land near modern-day Lake Village in Chicot County, Arkansas was acquired in the 1820s and 1830s by Abner Johnson, a planter from Kentucky.Donald P. McNeilly, Old South Frontier: Cotton Plantations and the Formation of Arkansas Society, Fayetteville, Arkansas, University of Arkansas Press, 2000, p. 39Marc R. Matrana, Lost Plantations of the South, Oxford, Mississippi: University Press of Mississippi, 2009, pp. 40-43 Johnson served as the Sheriff of Chicot County from 1830 to 1834.Charlie Daniels, Jennifer Hughes, The Historical Report of the Arkansas Secretary of State 2008, Fayetteville, Arkansas: University of Arkansas Press, 2009, p. 346 His plantation spanned 2,200 acres, with 42 African American slaves working in the cotton fields. By 1836, the Arkansas Territory had become a state of the United States of America. In 1840, the plantation was acquired by Elisha Worthington for US$60,000. Worthington also agreed to give 250 bales of cotton to Johnson annually for the next ten years. Alongside the land and several buildings, Worthington purchased 42 of Johnson's slaves in the transaction. He built a dock on the Mississippi River to facilitate the transportation of cotton. During the American Civil War of 1861-1865, the plantation was badly damaged by Union forces. Worthington moved his slaves and livestock to Texas from 1862 to 1865, and let his two mulatto children, including his son James W. Mason, take care of the land. On June 5, 1864, Union forces invaded the plantation to disrupt landings on the Mississippi River by the Confederate States Army. Meanwhile, on June 5‚Äì6, the Battle of Old River Lake, also known as the Battle of Ditch Bayou, took place not far from the plantation. By 1865, it had been declared \\"abandoned land\\" by the Freedmen's Bureau. Even though Worthington was pardoned by President Andrew Johnson, he decided to sell his plantation, partly due to the loss of his workforce, the dwindling price of cotton, and his worsening health. Reconstruction In 1866, Worthington sold the plantation to Robert P. Pepper of Kentucky. Two years later, in 1868, it was acquired by Major William Starling of the William Starling Company,Biographical and Historical Memoirs of Mississippi, Gretna, Louisiana: Pelican Publishing, 1999, Part 2, p. 819 through inheritance. In 1881, the plantation was acquired by John C. Calhoun II, the grandson of John C. Calhoun, and his brother, Patrick Calhoun. The brothers were seen as prominent financiers and builders of the \\"New South\\".John N. Ingham, Biographical Dictionary of American Business Leaders, Santa Barbara, California: Greenwood Publishing Group, Volume 1, 1983, pp. 124-125 Together, they founded the Calhoun Land Company, and attempted to bring former slaves back to their old plantations. John C. Calhoun II testified before the United States Senate Committee on Education and Labor in September 1883, explaining that his goal was to empower freedmen to save and become self-sufficient tenants. The testimony was so well-received that it was published by civil rights leader Timothy Thomas Fortune in his 1884 Black and White: Land, Labor, and Politics. In reality, while some freedmen managed to become tenants, other were sharecroppers, or even wage laborers. By the mid-1880s, the Calhoun brothers decided to sell the plantation, partly because of the flood of 1882. Convict laborers and Italian immigrants By 1886, it was acquired by the New York banker Austin Corbin as repayment of debt incurred by Calhoun. Corbin built a mansion, called Corbin House, and moored his boat, Austin Corbin, on Lake Chicot. He added a railroad from the cotton fields to the cotton gin to save time and boost production. He also established a telephone line to Greenville, Mississippi, the county seat of nearby Washington County, Mississippi, home to the cotton industry. However, most freedmen refused to work for Corbin, because he was not a Southerner but a carpetbagger. In 1894, Corbin entered into an agreement with the state of Arkansas to use convict laborers. He was given 250 convicts, who picked cotton on the plantation. The profits were split between Corbin and the state. With the help of Emanuele Ruspoli, 1st Prince of Poggio Suasa, who served as the Mayor of Rome from 1892 to 1899, Corbin brought Italian immigrants led by Pietro Bandini to work on the plantation. The immigrants came from Marche, Emilia and Veneto, setting sail from Genoa and arriving in New Orleans, Louisiana. They lived in a house on their own twelve-and-a-half acre lots of cotton, which they were obligated to pay back over the next twenty years, with an annual rate of five percent. Each immigrant picked the cotton on his own lot, which Corbin agreed to purchase. When Corbin died in 1896, many Italians stayed on the plantation. Moreover, Prince Ruspoli visited the plantation in 1896. In December 1898, Corbin's heirs leased the plantation to Hamilton R. Hawkins, Orlando B. Crittenden, Morris Rosenstock, and Leroy Percy. Percy, a prominent planter from Greenville, Mississippi, suggested that European peasants were more industrious than blacks. However, the businessmen were accused of \\"peonage.\\" In 1907, after hearing many complaints from immigrants, Edmondo Mayor des Planches, the Italian ambassador to the United States, visited the plantation. As he explained in his 1913 report, Attraverso gli Stati Uniti per L'Emigrazione Italiana, he was unimpressed by Percy's rosy rewriting of reality. Shortly afterward, Mary Grace Quackenbos, an attorney with the US Department of Justice, visited the plantation to look into repeated reports of peonage. In her report, she agreed that it was practised and added that only prosecution could put an end to it. Not surprisingly, Percy disagreed with her and suggested that the Italian immigrants could save a lot of money from their labor. Albert Bushnell Hart, a professor of history at Harvard University, agreed with Percy. Congressman Benjamin G. Humphreys II agreed with them and argued that immigrants could pay off their debts by selling their cotton. limited economic opportunities in Northern Italy caused not much to be done to support Quackenbos's views. Prosecution was stopped in its tracks, possibly because of Percy's friendship with US President Theodore Roosevelt with whom he had hunted bears on his Smedes Plantation, in Mississippi. Over the years, many of the Italian workers moved to St. James, Missouri, Irondale, Alabama and Tontitown, Arkansas. Others moved to Birmingham, Alabama, where they worked in coal and iron mines. Sweet Hope (Guernica Editions, 2011), a historical novel by Mary Bucci Bush, tells the story of Italian immigrants working on a Mississippi Delta cotton plantation in the early 1900s. It is based on the experiences of Bush's grandmother, who worked on the Sunnyside Plantation as a child. Sharecroppers and dissolve By the 1910s, the Italians were replaced by black sharecroppers. In 1920, the plantation was acquired by W.H. and J.C. Baird. Four years later, it was acquired by the Kansas City Life Insurance Company at an auction. In 1935, they leased it to the Arkansas Rural Rehabilitation Corporation. The plantation was visited by the Federal Writers' Project in the late 1930s. The plantation was finally broken up, as tracts of land were sold to individual buyers from 1941 to 1945, in the midst of World War II. Nowadays, only a historical marker reminds residents and visitors of its lost history.

History  Several months after the loss of the B√ºhl-Stollhofen Line, work began on the Ettlingen Line on the orders of the commander of the Rhine Army, George Louis of Brunswick-L√ºneburg. The line was reinforced during the War of the Polish Succession (1733‚Äì1738) by the introduction of watercourses that could be impounded, but in 1734 French troops broke through them and they were subsequently destroyed, but then rebuilt in 1735. Thereafter they lost their military significance.  Location  The line, which flanks from the Malscher Landgraben, lies between the Black Forest and the Rhine meadows south of where the city of Karlsruhe is today. Remains of the fortified line with their breastworks and a redoubt may still be seen southwest of Karlsruhe near a heath settlement, running for a distance of around 500 metres in the forest of Hardtwald. In the woods of Rheinstetten, an even longer section of the line is still visible.

Life Troy was born on 10 March 1827 in Essex County, Virginia. His mother was a free black woman and she married, then bought and set free, her husband. Troy became a confirmed Christian at the age of 13, although he was discriminated against in church because he was an African American. He was baptized into the Baptist church, but he was surprised to hear that the deacons and the church pastor were giving sermons to justify their own personal trade in slaves. The pastor would sell members of his own congregation. Troy and his wife left Virginia in disgust in March 1848, and moved to Cincinnati. In his new home, Reverend Troy was said to be the only \\"slave preacher\\" who was qualified to preach when he started. He was first a pastor at a church in Amherstburg in southern Canada, before settling in nearby Windsor, Ontario. In 1853 he held prayer meetings that led to the laying of a foundation stone for a church in Windsor in 1858. Troy founded the \\"First Baptist Church\\" in Windsor although the first local Baptist church had been established a few years before. Troy published a book of stories taken from the lives of slaves who had escaped from the United States to Canada. His book has been cited by historians as counter-evidence to the idea that slaves escaped and were smuggled across America by white activists. Troy gives examples of slaves who escaped north without the aid of the Underground Railroad. He described how John Hedgeman was helped to freedom by black slaves and free people, who risked arrest for assisting those escaping north to Canada. Troy traveled to Britain to raise funds for his church, where he gave lectures to anti-slavery societies. He traveled with William M. Mitchell, and was mentioned in the latter's book.The Under-Ground Railroad, William M. Mitchell, retrieved 25 June 2015 Troy also traveled throughout Europe, Jamaica and Haiti.\\"Rev. Dr. William Troy Laid to Rest\\", The Richmond Planet, Richmond, Virginia, 25 November 1905. Retrieved on 15 July 2015. In 1866 Troy relocated to Richmond, Virginia, where he spent nine months preaching and giving lectures. In 1867 he accepted a call to become the pastor of Richmond's Second Baptist Church. He resigned his pastorate in 1874 to found the Moore Street Industrial and Mission School and the Moore Street Baptist Church. In 1880 he was again called to be pastor of the Second Baptist Church, which calling he later resigned to found the Sharon Baptist Church. Family William Troy was married to Sidney Blackburn on 18 October 1847 in Essex County, Virginia.\\"Virginia, Marriages, 1785-1940,\\" database, FamilySearch, William Troy and Sidney, 18 Oct 1847 : accessed 16 July 2015; citing Essex County, Virginia, reference P260 en 2; FHL microfilm 31,275.

Troy, Mrs. Nannie Walker and one other son, of Newport News, Virginia.At the end of his life Troy resided with his daughter Annie in Camden.

Law was fired after issuing an injunction to temporarily halt the deportation of three foreign nationals. Eames issued an injunction in an unsuccessful attempt to temporarily halt Law's deportation. Eames was in Australia at the time and his visa was cancelled, preventing his return to Nauru. In the same month, the application fee for visas for foreign journalists was raised from $200 to $8000. In May and June 2014, Waqa suspended 5 of the 7 members of Nauru's Opposition from Parliament indefinitely. Three of the MPs, Mathew Batsiua, Kieren Keke and Roland Kun, were suspended in May 2014 for making comments to international media critical of the government and the alleged breakdown of the rule of law. Another two, Sprent Dabwido (a former president) and Squire Jeremiah were suspended a month later for behaving in an unruly manner. In June 2015, Jeremiah, Dabwido, and Batsiua were arrested and Kun had his passport cancelled amid claims that they had been trying to destabilise the Government by talking to foreign media. 19 people were charged with unlawful assembly and other offences following a protest outside the Parliament of Nauru on 16 June 2015. 3 pleaded guilty and the District Court sentenced 2 to imprisonment for 3 months and the 3rd to 6 months imprisonment. The Supreme Court of Nauru allowed an appeal, finding that the sentences were manifestly inadequate and increased them to 14 months and 22 months imprisonment. The High Court of Australia quashed the decision and remitted it to the Supreme Court \\"differently constituted, for hearing according to law.\\" The charges against Jeremiah, Dabwido, and Batsiua had a long and complex history. On 21 June 2018 Justice Geoff Muecke in the Supreme Court of Nauru ordered Nauru to pay their costs of defending the charges, in the amount of $224,021.90. Nauru did not pay this amount and on 13 September 2018 Justice Muecke ordered a permanent stay of the proceedings against them., unreported 13 September 2018, Supreme Court of Nauru. The Nauru government is appealing this decision to the Nauru Court of Appeal and will be heard by Michael Scott, the former Chief Justice of Tonga, John Muria, the Chief Justice of Kiribati and Nicholas Kirriwom, a judge of the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea.

It is most noted for its bespoke timepieces manufactured for the European Nobility in the 19th century.  Company Founder  Franciszek Czapek was a Czech-born, Polish master watchmaker who arrived in Geneva, Switzerland in May 1832. Soon after, he gallicised his name, thus becoming Fran√ßois Czapek. In 1834 he created the firm Czapek & Moreau with local Swiss watchmaker Moreau, from Versoix. Fran√ßois Czapek married (October 22, 1836) Marie, the daughter of clock and watchmaker Jonas Pierre Fran√ßois Gevril de Carouge (1777‚Äì1854). Czapek was the author of the first book on watchmaking ever published in the Polish language \\"Remarks on the watchmaking for the use of the watchmakers and the public\\" (S≈Ç√≥w kilka o Zegarmistrzowstwie ku u≈ºytku zegarmistrz√≥w i publiczno≈õci). The work was printed in 1850 in Leipzig.  Patek, Czapek & Cie. (1839-1845)  On May 1, 1839, Antoni Patek and Fran√ßois Czapek established a six-year partnership in Geneva under the name of Patek, Czapek & Cie. This partnership produced some exceptional watches which are part of important horological collection (King Farouk Collection, Patek Philippe Museum) or auctions (Antiquorum, Christies, Bonhams, Sotheby's). Czapek was head of watchmaking (‚ÄúFinisseur‚Äù) while Patek led the sales and the Company. As of July 1840, the firm came gradually to employ a half-dozen workmen. Several were Poles: Lilpop from Warsaw; Henryk Majewski from Lw√≥w; Siedlecki and Friedlein from Krak√≥w. Approximately 200 watches were produced yearly. After the dissolution, Patek established Patek Philippe & Co. with the new partner Adrien Philippe. Czapek founded Czapek & Cie. also with a new partner, Juliusz Gruzewski.  Czapek & Cie. (1845)  1850s Czapek & Cie advertisement In 1845 Francois Czapek founded Czapek & Cie. with a new partner, Juliusz Gruzewski (1808‚Äì1865), a close friend of French Emperor Napoleon III (1808‚Äì1873). Czapek's new company flourished. He became watchmaker to the Court of the Emperor Napoleon III ('Fournisseur de la cour - Purveyors to the Imperial Court\\") and had an Atelier in Geneva, a shop in Paris, Place Vendome 28 (established 1850), and another in Warsaw (established 1854). In 1855, Czapek & Cie. started supplying its watches to Emperor Napoleon III. Juliusz Gruzewski, Czapek's partner, was a personal friend of the Emperor a fact which no doubt allowed him to become watchmaker to the Imperial Court, supplying many of the watches that were given by him as diplomatic gifts. Czapek's clientele has included Khedive Ismail Pasha of Egypt and the House of Golitsyn. For unknown reasons, the company supposedly changed hands around 1869, possibly due to the illness or death of Czapek. Czapek's date of death is unknown. However a stem-winding pocket calendar watch (illustrated) contains a French inscription on the case inside translating as \\"Former Establishment Czapek and Company / No. 10630 / A. Chaillet Successor / 84 Rue du 4 Septembre / Paris\\". In another area it is inscribed \\"1876 / Rudzicki\\". This indicates that the business continued for some period after Czapek's departure. Historic Watch Gallery Image:czapek01.jpgAn open-face pocket watch Czapek & Cie., 18 karat gold Image:czapek02.jpgBack cover open, movement cover with engraved name of the watchmaker, serial No.10630, and (probably) the name of the store for which it was made. Image:czapek04.jpgWatch movement Image:czapek06.jpgBack cover with insignia Czapek & Cie.‚Äôs Renaissance (2011 - ) In 2011, Xavier de Roquemaurel, a luxury marketing consultant and watch lover, Harry Guhl an art expert, and S√©bastien Follonier, a watchmaker, came together to revive Czapek. The company was reestablished on October 21, 2011, by creating a first model, a design study Czapek Chronograph. The Company was relaunched and its development funded by an unprecedented equity campaign in November 2015, raising over 2 million CHF and bringing together more than 100 watch lovers and entrepreneurs from around the world. In an effort to remain as faithful as possible to Czapek's spirit and style, they created the first model of the collection based on the design of Czapek pocket watch No 3430 dating back to the 1850s. They adapted the ‚Äòface‚Äô design to modern standards and sizes and created a proprietary caliber, SXH1, in collaboration with Swiss movement maker Jean- Fran√ßois Mojon of Chronode, inspired by the original movement of the pocket watch. The architecture of the movement with its double open ratchets and double spring barrels is a modern interpretation of the original movement of the 1850s pocket watch, delivering the same 7-day power reserve. As a further homage to the history of Czapek & Cie, they named this first collection, ‚ÄòQuai des Bergues‚Äô, which was the address on the Rhone banks of his first Atelier in Geneva.

During the archaeological excavations in Sardinia, more than 500 of these bronze statuettes have been discovered, mainly in places of worship like the holy wells and the so-called megara temples but also in villages and nuraghes. Several statues were also found in excavations carried out in central Italy and precisely in Etruscan tombs of the 9th-8th century BC. Probably obtained with the lost wax technique, they can measure up to 39 cm. They represent scenes of everyday life of the nuragic people, depicting characters from various social classes, animal figures, warriors, chiefs, divinities, everyday objects and ships. Archaeologists have not been able yet to date the figures accurately: they were allegedly made between the IX¬∞ century BC and the VI¬∞ century BC; however, the recent discoveries at Orroli and at Ballao of fragments of bronze statues dating from the XIII¬∞ century BC have called into question their effective date. Arcaehologist Ralph A. Gonzalez dated the earliest types of bronze statuettes to the 12-11th century BC.

A chartaque in Eppingen. A carved wooden watchkeeper near the entrance to the Eppingen chartaque. The Eppingen lines () were a fortified defensive line, which stretched from Wei√üenstein near Pforzheim via M√ºhlacker, Sternenfels, Eppingen to Neckargem√ºnd in southern Germany. It had a total length of 86 kilometres.  Purpose  The French king, Louis XIV. (the \\"Sun King\\") made claims to the inheritance of Liselotte of the Palatinate (Elizabeth Charlotte). She had married Duke Philip of Orleans, the brother of Louis XIV. This conflict resulted in the War of the Palatine Succession. The Eppingen lines were built between 1695 and 1697 under Margrave Louis William of Baden, also known as \\"Turkish Louis\\", using socage labour, in order to prevent French raids during the Palatine succession crisis (1688‚Äì1697). Louis William of Baden understood the geographical advantage and the need for a state line of defence (Landesdefensionslinie). The location of the Eppingen lines had the benefit that the terrain could be held even against a stronger enemy. File:HGM Ludwig Wilhelm von Baden Baden.jpg\\"Turkish Louis\\" File:Louis XIV of France.jpgLouis XIV, the \\"Sun King\\"  Design  The bulwark consisted of a roughly 40-metre-wide Verhack, an abatis of branches and logs that was followed by a roughly 2.5-metre-deep ditch. The spoil from the ditch was used to build a rampart behind the ditch. The ditch and bank system of the Eppingen lines was guarded by watchtowers, called chartaques. A chartaque was a tower-like blockhouse with a plan measuring 6√ó6m and a height of about 12 metres. File:Chartaque 5.JPGModel of the original fortifications  Situation of the civilian population  Civilians from Durlach and Baden were forced to work on the construction of the defences. These so-called schanzers came from the area in front of the Eppingen lines and were thus at the mercy of French forces. The French army threatened to raze villages if schanzen were built. The German generals, for their part, threatened executions if the population did not assist with building the defences. Thus the people who lived in front of the lines often had to suffer twice as much.http://www.ploync.de/reisen/359-deutsche-verteidigungslinie-wachtuerme- auf-den-eppinger-linien-mit-bildern.html  Modern day reconstructions  Examples of the typical wooden watchtowers have been reconstructed and may be seen today at Eppingen () and M√ºhlacker (). In 1988 a 12.5-metre-high wooden observation tower was built at the Waldschanz south of Niefern-√ñschelbronn near . In the south, near Pforzheim, the line is linked to the Black Forest lines. The Eppingen Lines Way (Eppinger-Linien-Weg), a footpath, runs along the course of the defensive lines and through parts of the Stromberg- Heuchelberg Nature Park. It has display boards with information about the historic monument. The way is marked with a stylised symbol of a chartaque.

At one point during the attack, Rizvanoviƒá got out of the vehicle and stabbed passers-by. He was later arrested by police.  Attack  On 20 June 2015, a vehicular attack occurred at 12:15 p.m. in the center of the Austrian city of Graz. Alen Rizvanoviƒá, the driver, intentionally killed and injured pedestrians and cyclists by hitting them with a green SUV-type Daewoo Rexton, which he was driving at an estimated speed of up to per hour. According to a spokesperson, the rampage started in Zweiglgasse, where one victim died. Rizvanoviƒá then drove through the city, passing over the Sch√∂naugasse bridge and entering Herrengasse, where he killed two more people. He then crashed into a caf√© seating area in the Hauptplatz (main square), where an event related to the 2015 Austrian Grand Prix was being held. During his attack, Rizvanoviƒá jumped briefly out of his car, ran up to an elderly couple in front of a grocery shop, and stabbed them with a knife, wounding the man severely. He then drove to a police station at Schmiedgasse and was arrested by police without resistance. A witness compared the sounds of chairs and tables being knocked over by the vehicle to a \\"gunfight\\". The attack lasted for five minutes. Sixty ambulances and four helicopters were sent to transport injured victims to hospitals.  Victims  Three people were immediately killed in the attack and a total of 36 others, including three children, were wounded, six of them seriously and one critically. All of the casualties were hit by Rizvanoviƒá's car, with the exception of a couple, who were stabbed by Rizvanoviƒá when he got out of the car.  Perpetrator  Alen Rizvan Rizvanoviƒá, was 26-year-old when he carried out the attack. At the age of four he had fled along with his parents to Austria during the Bosnian War as a refugee and he later became an Austrian citizen. Rizvanoviƒá eventually found employment as a truck driver. He was under a restraining order filed on 28 May, which kept him away from the home of his wife and two young children following a domestic violence report being filed against him a month prior. As a result of the restraining order, police revoked Rizvanoviƒá's weapon's licence and confiscated a semiautomatic firearm and ammunition belonging to him. The motive was not immediately clear, but a few hours after the attack, police ruled out any religious or ideological motives. When he was arrested, Rizvanoviƒá claimed that he felt persecuted by \\"Turks\\". On 23 June, a remand was imposed on him. The previous day, it was reported by Austrian newspaper Die Presse that the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counterterrorism is \\"interested in Rizvanoviƒá\\". There are claims that Rizvanoviƒá had shifted to a stricter interpretation of Islam. Prior to the attack, he had more than 2,500 followers on Twitter, many of them from Arab countries and at least one a suspected neo- Nazi, but he deleted all of the tweets and messages on his online accounts, except for one, which indicated that the crime was premeditated and not the deed of a mentally ill person. Conviction Perpetrator was tried and convicted in 2016.  Reactions  A place for condolences in the Herrengasse, in front of the Grazer Stadtpfarr Church (22. June 2015).

Therefore, it is considered the second novel of a series.Amazon.com website, at https://www.amazon.com/dp/0316211222 . Plot This book has two plots. The primary plot concerns a serial killer who targets newlyweds on their honeymoons. FBI agent John O'Hara (who was central to the first book of this series) works this case, trying to determine who the killer is and why the killer targets particular newlyweds, but in a seemingly random manner. The second plot involves O'Hara personally, but he does not know this until another FBI agent, Sarah Brubaker, brings the matter to his attention.

He was born in Bellingen into a large Catholic family. He fought in the Boer War as part of the 2nd New South Wales Mounted Rifles, arriving in South Africa in April 1901. He returned to New South Wales in June 1902, and in 1903 married Kathleen Carney, settling at Raleigh. Here he became involved in the labour movement, running unsuccessfully as the Labor Party candidate for Raleigh in the 1907 state election. In 1910 he moved to Sydney after the death of his wife, and began work as a wharf labourer. He ran as an independent social democrat for the seat of Pyrmont in the 1910 state election. McCristal became active in the local Wharf Labourers' Union, forming an association with Billy Hughes who remained its secretary while serving in federal parliament. He enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force at the outbreak of World War I, serving in the 1st Light Horse Regiment. He arrived in Egypt in December 1914 and also served at Gallipoli, where he was wounded in August 1915. He was evacuated, and the shrapnel in his legs made further active service impossible. He was returned to Australia to serve as an army recruiter, arriving in Melbourne in April 1916. This occupation was short-lived and he was discharged on health grounds in June. In 1916, on his return from the war, McCristal had become President of the Sydney Wharf Labourers' Union, and became a campaigner against conscription. He was involved in expelling his former friend Hughes from the union, and the union submitted his name as a potential Labor candidate for Hughes' vacated seat of West Sydney at the 1917 federal election; he lost to Con Wallace, who went on to win the seat. McCristal remained active in the anti-conscription campaign, and in August 1917 he was arrested and charged with sedition following a meeting at the Sydney Domain, in which he called the King and parliamentarians \\"parasites\\". Convicted on 16 November 1917, he was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment, which he served at Goulburn Gaol. On his release McCristal became involved with the Industrial Socialist Labor Party, running as its candidate for the seat of Cook in 1919. He also contested the 1921 West Sydney by-election. In 1922 he became NSW president of the Waterside Workers' Federation, and ran again for the ISLP in the state election of that year. Back in the official Labor fold by 1925, he contested Ryde at the state election, and in 1934 he ran as the Lang Labor candidate for the federal seat of Cowper against Earle Page. During this period he was in court three times: once in 1922, when he was fined ¬£10 for encouraging a strike; again in 1932, when he was acquitted of causing bodily harm after a conflict with a sub-tenant; and finally in 1933, when he unsuccessfully sued the Sun for libel regarding its account of the 1932 case. In 1937 he was again endorsed as the Labor candidate for Cowper, but the executive refused to endorse him and he left the Labor Party for good. He contested the 1943 federal election for the \\"Soldier Citizens and War Workers Labour Party\\", running in the seat of West Sydney. He ran for Oxley in the 1944 state election for the Australian Labor Movement, and in 1947 contested Marrickville. He now became associated with the Australian Republican Party, a group supporting a United States-style republic for Australia. He contested the 1949, 1951, 1954, 1955 and 1958 federal elections and the 1950, 1953, 1956 and 1962 state elections, as well as a 1954 by-election for the state seat of Leichhardt. By now he was generally polling very small totals. McCristal attracted some attention in 1952 when he attended the funeral of his old foe Hughes, who he said had \\"contributed much to Labor's cause and been a great Australian\\". He contested his last election in 1962 at the age of 81, and died at Repatriation General Hospital at Concord. He had contested twenty-one elections unsuccessfully over a period of fifty-five years.

Fireboats in San Diego have been operated on San Diego Bay by the city of San Diego, California since the early 20th century, as well as by the Port of San Diego since its creation as a quasi-governmental agency serving the entire Bay in 1962. City of San Diego Fire-Rescue Department The city's first fireboat, the Bill Kettner, was named after San Diego's Congressional Representative William Kettner. The vessel was built by the city's own firefighters in their own workshop. She was commissioned in 1919. The Point Loma II, a small patrol vessel with a modest pumping capacity, served from 1957 to 1977. She had a single water cannon, only capable of pumping 1,200 gallons per hour. The Bill Kettner was retired in 1961, when she was replaced by the Shelter Island. The Shelter Island had two water cannon, capable of pumping 2,000 gallons per minute and 1,000 gallons per minute. A third vessel, the Harbor Island, was also put into service. She had a single water cannon, capable of pumping 2000 gallons per minute. The Shelter Island and Harbor Island are named after \\"islands\\" (actually peninsulas) in the San Diego Bay. On June 26, 2015, a new high speed vessel christened the Marine 3 began operation by the San Diego Lifeguard Department. San Diego Lifeguard Services is a unit of the San Diego Fire- Rescue Department. The vessel is equipped for both search and rescue and firefighting duties. It is equipped with infrared and other sensors, for helping to find missing sailors and lost boats. The two water cannon, each capable of pumping 12,000 gallons per minute, can be remotely controlled from the cabin. The lifeguard department's previous rescue and fire vessel had just a single water cannon, capable of pumping only 500 gallons per minute. The vessel cost $1 million, and its projected life is 25 years. San Diego Harbor Police The San Diego Harbor Police is the law enforcement authority for the Port of San Diego. It provides uniformed police services as well as marine firefighting. The department has an area of responsibility that includes the San Diego Bay shorelines of the cities of San Diego, National City, Chula Vista, Imperial Beach, and Coronada. Harbor Police officers are cross-trained in law enforcement and firefighting. On November 22, 2010, the city accepted two new fireboats, to be operated by the San Diego Harbor Police, that were paid for by a port security grant from the federal Department of Homeland Security. The two new vessels each have three water cannon. They replaced three older and less capable vessels, that had been in service for 35 years. In 2011 the City of San Diego agreed to accept three more vessels, under another grant from the Department of Homeland Security. The five identical vessels are MetalCraft FireStorm 36 fireboats and are capable of approximately 2,200 gallons per minute.

During her time in Jamaica La Havas played music for her family alongside dancehall and reggae producer Stephen McGregor (known under his production name Di Genius), who would later go on to produce the majority of the songs on Blood. Besides Stephen McGregor, La Havas worked with a variety of other producers, including Matt Hales. The song is a rhythm and blues tune with jazz and doo-wop that grows slowly, and pinpoints the voice of the singer. The arrangement of the song takes a backseat, while the production has a \\"canned sound for the verses\\", before starting the choruses. Horns, gospel-choir style supporting vocals, piano and brass complete the composition.

The film is based on Susannah Cahalan's memoir Brain on Fire: My Month of Madness and stars Chlo√´ Grace Moretz, Jenny Slate, Thomas Mann, Tyler Perry, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Richard Armitage. The film follows a New York Post writer who begins to suffer a mysterious illness. After being evaluated extensively by many doctors, she was diagnosed to be psychotic. She would have been committed to psychiatric ward in a hospital and probably died of encephalitis, if it weren't for the efforts and skills of a Syrian-American neurologist (Souhel Najjar). He empathized with her case, was able to diagnose and treat her rare illness. Principal photography began on July 13, 2015, in Vancouver, British Columbia. It had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 14, 2016. The film was released on Netflix on June 22, 2018.  Plot  21-year-old Susannah Cahalan (Chlo√´ Grace Moretz) is a writer for The New York Post who lives with her new boyfriend Stephen (Thomas Mann). Susannah becomes suddenly ill, initially showing symptoms of a common flu like a cough and fatigue, but later begins presenting strange behaviour while in a trance state, such as hearing people say things they haven't said and hypersensitivity to loud noises. Over time, her behaviour becomes more and more erratic. Finally, Susannah suffers a seizure and seeks medical treatment. The doctor consulted is adamant it is down to Susannah partying too much, working too hard and not getting enough sleep. She moves in with her mother Rhona (Carrie-Anne Moss) and, after an emotional outburst, suffers another seizure, and is taken to a clinic where she undergoes an MRI. Susannah also believes she may have bipolar disorder due to her severe mood changes. Rhona struggles to care for Susannah, and she later moves in with her father Tom (Richard Armitage) and his new fianc√©. During dinner one night, she becomes violent towards them while suffering another outburst, and her parents demand she is hospitalized despite the MRI, EEG, and all other tests showing normal results. In the hospital, one the doctors informs Susannah's parents she could have schizophrenia, and says that if her behaviour does not improve, she will be transferred to a psychiatric hospital. Susannah gradually becomes catatonic, and Dr. Souhel Najjar (Navid Negahban) is asked to help in investigating her case. He has Susannah draw a clock; she draws it with all of the numbers (1‚Äì12) on the right side of the face, leading Najjar to believe that the right hemisphere of her brain is swollen and inflamed. Najjar has her undergo a brain biopsy in order to take cells from her brain for diagnosis. Following the biopsy, it is found that Susannah has a rare disease called anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, a brain inflammation, which Najjar describes as \\"brain on fire\\". Najjar begins treatment, which leads to a slow but full recovery of her cognitive abilities. Seven months later, Susannah is back at work. She presents her first written piece since her recovery to her boss Richard (Tyler Perry). It is well received, and he asks her to start writing a book about her experience, which she later titles 'Brain on Fire'. Before the credits, text on screen confirms Susannah Catalan was the 217th person to be diagnosed with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, but her memoir has helped people all over the world, leading to thousands being diagnosed and treated since. She and Najjar remain close friends.

Scattered throughout the island, along with the Giants' grave and the megaron temples, they testify to the deep religiosity of the Nuragic populations. These temples were a place of pilgrimage and ceremonies: it is believed that at certain times of year the various nuragic populations of the area gathered together in their vicinity. The oldest temples were built in the style of the nuraghe, with blocks of stone not perfectly squared; over time they were built with a greater accuracy. The most common type is composed of a circular well built with blocks of stone, which was accessed by steps that descended to water level.Pozzi Sacri, il portale sardo They are a clear example of the architectural mastery of the nuragics and evidence of their reverence for water sources. In the past it was thought that they were built between the eighth and sixth centuries BC; the latest findings, however, have led archaeologists to estimate that the temples date from the time when there was a close relationship between the Mycenaean kingdoms, Crete and Sardinia (around 1300 BC). An almost certain dating comes from recent excavations in the Holy Well of Funtana Coberta, near Ballao, which lack completely Iron Age nuragic ceramics, while there are finds from the Aegean. The Well of Ballao was probably built in the late Bronze Age and abandoned some centuries later.

It was built in 1715 by the Order of Saint John as one of a series of coastal fortifications around the Maltese Islands. Until recently, the redoubt was used as a police station. History Briconet Redoubt was built in 1715 as part of the first building programme of coastal batteries and redoubts in Malta. It formed part of the defences of Marsaskala Bay, which also included the large St. Thomas Tower and Battery and the now-demolished ≈ªonqor Tower. The redoubt viewed from the rear Briconet Redoubt's structure is typical of most other coastal redoubts built in Malta. It consists of a pentagonal platform having short flanks, and a rectangular blockhouse sealing off the gorge. Unlike other redoubts, the gorge and flanks have high boundary walls pierced by musketry loopholes. These were built to defend the redoubt from a landward attack, since it is overlooked by high ground. Construction of the redoubt cost 768 scudi. These were paid by the knight Giovanni Battista Briconet, and the redoubt was named in his honour. The redoubt was initially garrisoned by militia from ≈ªejtun, and it was armed with two cannons. Present day View of the redoubt with one of the modern structures visible Today, Briconet Redoubt is still intact and in good condition, being one of the best preserved redoubts in Malta. A few modern modifications have been made, such as the opening of a small doorway on one of its faces to enable access from the modern road. The redoubt is surrounded by modern buildings, including Marsaskala's parish church, which have completely blocked its relation with the sea. Until the early 21st century, Briconet Redoubt was used as the Marsaskala Police Station, until this was moved to an irregular structure in a garden next to the church. Today, the redoubt is a Grade 1 national monument and it is also listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands.

The term was coined by Herbert Read in 1952 in his description of the work of the eight British artists represented in the \\"New Aspects of British Sculpture\\" exhibition at the Biennale di Venezia of 1952.  Venice  The eight artists who exhibited \\"New Aspects of British Sculpture\\" in the British pavilion at the Biennale di Venezia of 1952 were Robert Adams, Kenneth Armitage, Reg Butler, Lynn Chadwick, Geoffrey Clarke, Bernard Meadows, Eduardo Paolozzi and William Turnbull. All were under 40, with years of birth ranging from 1913 to 1924, and of a younger generation than established British sculptors such as Barbara Hepworth and Henry Moore. A large bronze by Moore, Double Standing Figure, stood outside the British pavilion, and contrasted strongly with the works inside. Unlike the smoothly carved work of Hepworth and Moore, these were angular, jagged, rough-textured or spiky. They were more linear and open; Philip Hendy compared Butler's sculptures to three-dimensional drawings. Many of the sculptures in the pavilion were of human or animal figures, and several showed the influence of the continental sculptors Germaine Richier and Alberto Giacometti, works by whom had been shown at the Anglo-French Art Centre in London in 1947. The British sculptures were seen as reflecting the angst, the anxieties and the guilt of the immediate post-War period, with the recent memory of the War, the Holocaust and Hiroshima, and the fear of nuclear proliferation and the effects of the Cold War. In his catalogue description, Herbert Read wrote: Read's quotation \\"scuttling across the floors of silent seas\\" is from The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock by T.S. Eliot and is a reference to Crab, a sculpture by Bernard Meadows in the exhibition. Read's words were widely quoted, and despite the differences in style and technique between the eight artists, they came to be known as the Geometry of Fear group.  Reception  The Geometry of Fear exhibition was well received, both within and outside Britain. Alfred Barr, the former director of the New York Museum of Modern Art, spoke highly of the sculptors and bought work by three of them ‚Äì Robert Adams, Reg Butler and Lynn Chadwick ‚Äì for the museum; he described the exhibition as \\"the most distinguished national showing of the Biennale\\". All eight sculptors achieved rapid recognition and career success in the 1950s. In 1953 Butler won the international competition to design the monument to the Unknown Political Prisoner, chosen over more than two thousand entries including submissions by Naum Gabo and Barbara Hepworth; the prize was ¬£4500, enough at the time to buy a large house. In 1956 Lynn Chadwick won the Grand Prize for Sculpture at the Biennale di Venezia of that year, selected over C√©sar, Giacometti and Richier. Within a decade the Geometry of Fear group had fallen from view. In the 1960s British sculpture was dominated by the abstract, particularly that associated with Anthony Caro and his circle at Saint Martin's School of Art. Figurative expressionism and post-war angst were out of style. Butler's eighteen-metre Unknown Political Prisoner was never executed; he, like Adams, Clarke and Meadows, essentially disappeared. Chadwick and Armitage were neglected in Britain but had some following in other countries, while Paolozzi and Turnbull began to work in different styles and remained in the public eye.  Other artists  While the Geometry of Fear group initially consisted only of the eight sculptors who exhibited in Venice in 1952, and never had any of the characteristics of an art movement, other artists have been associated with it, or thought to have been influenced by it. These include, among others, the sculptors Ralph Brown, Anthony Caro (in his early work), Robert Clatworthy, Hubert Dalwood, Elisabeth Frink, George Fullard, John Hoskin and Leslie Thornton, and the painter John Berger. The post-War paintings of Francis Bacon and Graham Sutherland share some of the Atomic Age anxieties of the Geometry of Fear sculptors. References  Further reading  * Herbert Read (1952).

Symbolic reset On 6 March 2009 in Geneva, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton presented Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov with a red button with the English word \\"reset\\" and the Roman alphabet transliteration of the Russian Cyrillic alphabet word –ø–µ—Ä–µ–≥—Ä—É–∑–∫–∞ (\\"peregruzka\\"). It was intended that this would be the Russian word for \\"reset\\" but actually was the word for \\"overload\\". (The correct translation would be –ø–µ—Ä–µ–∑–∞–≥—Ä—É–∑–∫–∞ [\\"perezagruzka\\"].) Additionally, the button switch was the type commonly used as an emergency stop on industrial equipment. Substantive reset Russian President Medvedev and U.S. President Obama in Honolulu, Hawaii, November 2011 Prior to the reset, US-Russia relations had been hurt by the 2008 Russo-Georgian diplomatic crisis in Ossetia and the Russo-Georgian War, leading to Immediate Response 2008 by the Bush administration. In private, several Obama administration officials expressed doubts about the reset and were concerned that it was overly optimistic, particularly Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and U.S. ambassador to Russia John Beyrle. In July 2009, Russian president Dmitry Medvedev announced that U.S. forces and supplies could pass through Russian airspace on their way to Afghanistan. On 17 September 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama announced that the U.S. was dropping the Bush Administration's plan to build a missile defence shield in Eastern Europe. Russia had viewed the planned missile shield as a military threat. Vladimir Putin said the decision was \\"correct and brave\\". In March, 2010, the U.S. and Russia agreed to reduce their nuclear arsenals. In May 2010, major powers including the U.S., China and Russia agreed on sanctions against Iran. Three days later, the Obama Administration cancelled sanctions against the Russian state arms export agency, which had been sanctioned for exporting arms to Iran. In response to the adoption of the Magnitsky Act in 2012, the Russian government denied Americans adoption of Russian children and issued a list of US officials prohibited from entering Russia. At the 2015 Munich Security Conference, Vice President Biden specified the substantive progress, and setbacks: Subsequent deterioration of relations As early as the March 2014 censure of Russia by the United Nations over the Russian annexation of Crimea, the days after ousted pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych fled Ukraine, the reset was described in the press as \\"failed\\". Stated reasons included the Russian annexation of Crimea, the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine, and lack of Russian cooperation with the U.S. on Syria. Former Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs Adam Rotfeld stated that the reset showed \\"weakness\\". Jeb Bush also called the reset a failure, stating that Russia had \\"invaded Ukraine\\", which Russia had not done prior to the reset. He said that Putin was a \\"bully\\" and that \\"nuanced\\" behavior by the U.S. towards Putin tended to \\"enable bad behavior.\\" Russia denied that it had sent troops into Ukraine. However, Hillary Clinton defended the reset as a \\"brilliant stroke\\", pointing to the Russian agreement to sanctions against Iran and permission to fly over its territory to supply joint NATO troops in Afghanistan. In October 2014, Medvedev said that a reset of relations with the U.S. was \\"impossible\\", and that relations had been damaged by \\"destructive\\" and \\"stupid\\" Western sanctions against Russia. The sanctions had been imposed because of the Ukraine crisis and the shooting down of flight MH17, which Western powers said was the result of a missile fired from rebel-controlled territory. In April 2015, CNN reported that \\"Russian hackers\\" had \\"penetrated sensitive parts of the White House\\" computers in \\"recent months.\\" It was said that the FBI, the Secret Service, and other U.S. intelligence agencies categorized the attacks \\"among the most sophisticated attacks ever launched against U.S. government systems.\\" In April 2016, two Russian jets flew over the US destroyer USS Donald Cook almost a dozen times, American officials said. At one point the jets were so close - about 9m (30ft) - that they created wakes in the water around the ship. The jets had no visible weaponry and the ship took no action. This sharp decline in relations has been termed Cold War II by some.

As a two-year-old she showed progressive form, winning two minor races before finishing second in the May Hill Stakes and third in the Fillies' Mile. In the following year she ran poorly on her seasonal debut but won then won a minor stakes race before ending her racing career with a win in the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot. She was then retired from racing. She had little success as a broodmare, producing only two minor winners. Background Kissing Cousin was a bay mare with a small white star and a white sock on her left hind leg bred in Ireland by her owner Sheikh Mohammed. She was from the first crop of foals sired by Danehill a sprinter who won the Cork and Orrery Stakes and the Haydock Sprint Cup in 1989. Danehill went on to become and exceptionally successful breeding stallion producing the winners of more than a thousand races, including one hundred and fifty-six at Group One/Grade I level. Among his best offspring are Duke of Marmalade, Dylan Thomas, Rock of Gibraltar, George Washington and North Light. Her dam First Kiss won two minor races as a three-year-old in 1986 and was the granddaughter of Pistol Packer, a leading racemare who won the Prix de Diane and finished second in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. She was also a distant relative of Noblesse who won The Oaks and later became an influential broodmare. The filly was sent into training with Henry Cecil at his Warren Place stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career 1993: two-year-old season As a two-year-old, Kissing Cousin showed little early promise, finishing unplaced in maiden races at Newbury in May and Nottingham in June. In July, she recorded her first success when winning a six furlong maiden at Haydock Park Racecourse and followed up two weeks later in a minor race at Thirsk winning by six lengths at odds of 4/6. On her next appearance, the filly was moved up in class and distance for the Group Three May Hill Stakes over one mile at Doncaster Racecourse on 9 September. Ridden by Michael Roberts, she started the 5/2 joint-favourite and led for most of the way before being overtaken in the final furlong and was beaten two lengths into second place by the Michael Stoute trained Hawajiss. Later in the month she was moved up to the highest class for the Group One Fillies' Mile at Ascot Racecourse and started the 7/1 third favourite in the eleven-runner field. Roberts again sent her into the lead from the start and she maintained her advantage until the final furlong when she was overtaken and finished third behind Fairy Heights and Dance To The Top. The tactics were repeated when Kissing Cousin ended her season in the Rockfel Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse in October. She led till the last quarter mile but tired in the closing stages to finish sixth of the nine runners behind the Luca Cumani-trained Relatively Special. 1994: three-year-old season Kissing Cousin made her first appearance as a three-year-old in the seven furlong Fred Darling Stakes (a trial race for the 1000 Guineas) at Newbury on 15 April. Ridden for the first time by Mick Kinane she raced in second before fading in the last quarter mile and finished last of the seven runners behind Bulaxie. The filly missed the 1000 Guineas and reappeared in a minor stakes race at Leicester Racecourse on 23 May in which she was ridden by Willie Ryan. Starting at odds of 3/1 in a four-runner field she took the lead from the start and drew away in the last quarter mile and drew away in the last two furlongs to win by twenty lengths from Miss Kristin. On 15 June, Kissing Cousin was moved back up to Group One class for the 145th running of the Coronation Stakes over one mile at Royal Ascot. With Kinane in the saddle, she started at odds of 13/2 (having been backed down from 20/1 on the morning of the race) in a nine-runner field, with the 1000 Guineas winner Las Meninas being made the 9/4 favourite. The other contenders included Relatively Special, Mehthaaf (Irish 1,000 Guineas), Lemon Souffle, Prophecy and the unbeaten Zafaaf. Kinane sent the filly into the lead from the start and she maintained her advantage into the straight ahead of Lemon Souffle and the French-trained outsider Eternal Reve. In the final furlong Kissing Cousin was strongly challenged by Eternal Reve but ran on \\"gamely\\" to win by a short head, with Mehthaaf two and a half lengths back in third ahead of Lemon Souffle. After the race Henry Cecil commented \\"She's very genuine but she just has her days. I told Sheikh Mohammed that she would either win or finish last. I haven't worked out any plans for her, but at least she's won a Group One, even if she never wins anything else\\". Kissing Cousin never raced again and was retired at the end of the year. Breeding record After her retirement from racing, Kissing Cousin became a broodmare for her owner's Darley Stud. She produced at least five foals and two minor winners between 1996 and 2001: *Greetings, a bay filly, foaled in 1996, sired by Rainbow Quest. Unraced. *Patruel, bay filly, 1997, by Rainbow Quest. Won one race. *Kissinger, colt, 1998, by Nashwan. Unraced. *Realism, bay colt (later gelded), 2000, by Machiavellian. Won ten flat races and one hurdle race. *Houbara, dark bay or brown colt (later gelded), 2001, by Octagonal. Failed to win in five races. Pedigree *Like all of Danehill's offspring Kissing Cousin is inbred 4 √ó 4 to the mare Natalma. This means that she occurs twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

It was well-received, mainly due to its innovative graphic style, and was followed two years later by a sequel.  Gameplay  The player takes the role of \\"Mugsy\\", an American gangster. The aim of the game is for Mugsy to become \\"the most powerful gang leader in the city\\". In each 'turn' of the game, which represents one year, decisions must be made about how much money should be spent on weapons and ammunition to fight other gangs, how many business from which he should attempt to extract protection money, and how much bribery of local law enforcement should take place. The game was marketed as a \\"interactive video comic strip\\"; it was highly visual, with graphics (produced using the software house's own title, Melbourne Draw) intended to be similar to comic book drawings. Information was presented to the player in the form of dialogue between on-screen characters, such as Mugsy himself, and an unnamed assistant. At each decision point, the player enters text into a 'speech bubble' dialogue box. There was no real plot or narrative arc within the game as a whole; each year's activities were essentially the same, with the same decisions being required to be made by the player. However, there was a small arcade element, which was triggered in the event that one of Mugsy's rivals orders a contract killing on him. When this happened, the player controls Mugsy directly, and must shoot the assassins who are sent after him before Mugsy gets shot too many times himself. Release The title was heavily publicised in the year of its release, with at least 26 advertisements in the trade press, many of them 2-page spreads. The release of the game was preceded by a promotional campaign including actors dressed as gangsters visiting the offices of some computing magazines. It was originally released in 1984 in the UK, by Melbourne House. It was later re-released in Spain by Iveson Software SA. It was priced at ¬£6.95 in the UK, and 1900 pesetas for the Spanish re- released version. In 1986, it was included in a compilation of titles called 'Off The Hook', aimed at raising money to combat drug addiction.  Reception  Reviews of the Spectrum edition were very positive; Your Sinclair's \\"Joystick Jury\\" rated it a \\"hit\\", citing its impressive graphics, and a structure that, while logical, provided a high level of replayability, as each game ended differently. It was also the winner of a Crash Reader's Award for \\"Best Strategy and Simulation\\". The magazine commented positively on the graphics, partly because the visual style was \\"suited to a game set in the roaring twenties\\"; this was despite \\"Mugsy\\" having to take place before 1919, since that is when its sequel, Mugsy's Revenge, begins. Legacy A sequel, Mugsy's Revenge was published two years later, and ported to the Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC.

It is found in shallow waters in the Caribbean Sea where it is a common species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". Description Fire corals are colonial coral-like organisms that secrete calcareous skeletons. Colonies of Millepora complanata have an encrusting base and thin upright plates or blades growing to a height of about . The surface of the blades is smooth and the outer margins irregular, with many stumpy protrusions. This fire coral is pale brown or cream coloured, with white tips to the blades. The feeding and defensive polyps are hair-like and project through fine pores on the surface of the blades. Contact with this fire coral by bare skin can cause a severe stinging sensation. Distribution and habitat Millepora complanata has a widespread distribution in the Caribbean Sea and is a relatively common species on reefs in shallow water at depths down to about . It often grows in areas with vigorous water movement and turbid waters, and is tolerant of siltation. Biology Growing at San Salvador Island, Bahamas Some of the polyps of Millepora complanata are dactylozooids with hair-like processes and stinging cells that detect the presence of zooplankton and help entrap it. Other polyps are gastrozooids and their chief function is the ingestion of food for the colony. Copepods form the main part of the diet. The soft tissues of M. complanata contain zooxanthellae, symbiotic photosynthetic dinoflagellates. These provide much of the organic carbon needed by the fire coral. The reproduction of fire corals is complex and involves an alternation of asexual and sexual generations. The encrusting parts of the coral expand by the growth of stolons, and the edges of blades expand by sympodial growth. Sexual reproduction involves a sessile polyploid stage and the budding off of planktonic medusae. Broken off fragments of coral blades can successfully reattach to the substrate and M. complanata is one of the first coral species to recolonise damaged reefs. Millepora complanata is susceptible to coral bleaching, a process by which stressed corals expel their zooxanthellae and turn white. In a mass bleaching event in the Caribbean in 1998 caused by thermal stress, both M. complanata and the closely related Millepora alcicornis were affected but M. alcicornis more severely so. Many colonies were killed but some, especially colonies of M. complanata, recovered and regained their colour over the course of a few months.
