The site of the fort was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. History Northwest Territory Governor Arthur St. Clair ordered a chain of forts to be built North from Cincinnati in order to project United States power into Native American territory. Following St. Clair's Defeat in November 1791, the United States Army retreated to Fort Jefferson, Fort Hamilton, and finally Fort Washington (Cincinnati, Ohio). Major General St. Clair departed for Philadelphia in January 1792, and Lieutenant Colonel James Wilkinson assumed command of the United States forces at Fort Washington. Wilkinson noted that it took two days to travel from Fort Hamilton to Fort Jefferson, which contributed to the suffering of the wounded who could not leave Fort Jefferson following St. Clair's Defeat. Wilkinson ordered the construction of Fort Saint Clair between the other two forts in order to secure communications and supply convoys between the chain of United States outposts. In November 1792, following the decision of a Native American Grand Council at the mouth of the Auglaize River, Little Turtle led a force of 200 Miami and Shawnee past United States outposts of Fort Jefferson and Fort St. Clair, and reached Fort Hamilton on 3 November with the intention of an attack near the United States settlements on the anniversary of St. Clair's Defeat. They captured two prisoners and learned that a large convoy of packhorses had left for Fort Jefferson and was due back in a matter of days. Little Turtle moved North and found the convoy, nearly 100 horses and 100 Kentucky militia led by Major John Adair, camped just outside Fort St. Clair. Little Turtle attacked at dawn, just as Major Adair recalled his sentries. The militia conducted an organized retreat to the fort, losing six killed and four missing, while another five were wounded. Major Adair later criticized Fort St. Clair's commandant, Captain Bradley, for his failure to come to their aid. Little Turtle's force lost two warriors, but captured the camp and all provisions. All horses were killed, wounded, or driven off; only 23 were later recovered. Wilkinson considered the horses to be a loss that would make the advanced forts un-defendable.

Description Metro M1, station St≈ô√≠≈ækov on line C The Metro M1 train consists of five units. Because of differences in the technical equipment of each car, the train is indivisible. It is driven by asynchronous motors with microprocessor control, in contrast to the motors used in Soviet trains. The train has a central control system that allows the train crew, data collection and evaluation, including diagnostics. Maximum capacity of one car is 48 seats (40 for the first and last car) for sitting and 252 standing places (242 for the first and last car). The metro runs automatically, the driver only ensures the door opening and closing and reporting of stations. The metro is checked from the central dispatching of the Prague metro.

History  The founding members of the group were Pavel Pepperstein, Sergei Anufriev, and Yuri Leiderman. An associate of the group, the journalist Anton Nosik, originally coined the phrase 'Medical Hermeneutics'. According to the OED, hermeneutics is the branch of knowledge that deals with interpretation, especially of the bible or literary texts. The group created installations and performances which experimented with language and meaning, imagining their work as an investigation of their culture at a time when Glasnost was opening it up to the West. They described Glasnost as a moment when ‚Äòthe sky opened up‚Äô, akin to psychedelic experience, when a rupture between systems brings anxiety as well as the promise of renewal. Their work drew from Russian traditions and fairy tales ‚Äì often relating these to objects from Western visual culture ‚Äì as well as psychedelia and pseudo- scientific methodology. Asked to explain the term Medical Hermeneutics, Sergei Anufriev answered: ‚ÄúThe essence of it is the following: a collective mindset constantly directs consciousness into the outer regions - ideology, criticism, back to ideology. This creeping development is not an evolution but rather a kind of disease, that is, something that should be treated. The therapy may reveal things not related to the stated issues, a bit like a spill- over‚Äù.V.Tupitsyn, Inspecting the Inspectors, Flash Art, Issue No. 1, Moscow, 1989 In Pepperstein‚Äôs words, Inspection Medical Hermeneutics produced ‚Äòa thick mumble, white noise and other incomprehensible, unclear things‚Äô.Pavel Pepperstein cited in Ulli Moser, 'Inspection Medical Hermeneutics' (trans. Patrick Kremer), Kunstforum, no. 118, 1992, p.372. In his book on Moscow Conceptualism, Professor Matthew Jesse Jackson writes, ‚ÄúUniting, according to Pepperstein, the camaraderie of John Landis‚Äôs Blues Brothers and the method of Deleuze and Guattari‚Äôs Anti-Oedipus, the inspection combined western mass culture with the rigorous analysis of collective actions, styling itself as an alternative monitoring agency, a quasi-institutional entity designed to resist the recent invasion of foreign ‚Äúexperts‚Äù. Soon the group set up its own inspection team to visit artists' studios and other locales around Moscow (and the Soviet Union). Employing a variation on the five-point grading mechanism of the Soviet educational system (dubbed the Higher Evaluative Category), the Med-Hermeneuts juxtaposed their childish grading to the supposedly learned opinions of Western ‚Äòspecialists‚Äô ‚Äú. He continues: ‚ÄúA typical undertaking occurred in May 1988 at a presentation in which Pepperstein encouraged members of a Moscow audience to don a stethoscope to listen to the beating heart of an infant depicted on an empty box of Soviet baby-food. Such actions synthesised the absurd, therapeutic and analytical motivations of the inspection‚Äù.M. Jesse Jackson, The Experimental Group: Ilya Kabakov, Moscow Conceptualism, Soviet Avant-Gardes, University Of Chicago Press, 2010, p 230. In 1991 Yuri Leiderman left the group, and Vladimir Fedorov joined. In 1998 the XI issue of the influential Russian art journal Mesto Pechati was dedicated to the tenth anniversary of Inspection Medical Hermeneutics.Mecto Pechati, No 11, Obscuri Viri, Moscow 1998 The group officially ceased to exist on September 11, 2001, the day of the terrorist atrocity in New York.  Notable installations   Klinger's Boxes  Klinger‚Äôs Boxes Cold Reduction was first exhibited at Galerie Grita Insam in Vienna in 1991. The installation comprises seven wooden boxes each with its own fantastical drawing by Pepperstein under a glass cover. From each box hangs a pair of woollen mittens. The eccentric and erotic drawings are copies of a series by the turn-of-the- century German artist Max Klinger, which all focus on the motif of the glove. Pavel Pepperstein described the idea behind the work thus: \\"The series Klinger‚Äôs Boxes is dedicated to the theme of Russia as a memory of Europe. Russia is a northern country with a cold climate and this prevents things from quick degradation and decay. Therefore, traditional forms of European thought and orientation, now forgotten in Europe, have been preserved in Russia. Some elements of traditional Russian winter clothing act as the keepers of European memory. Elements of bourgeois and dated European culture are warmed up by typical Russian objects connected with cold. These objects, such as felt boots, woollen mittens, hats with ear-flaps, downy (fluffy) shawls, which were elements of the basic peasant‚Äôs clothing, are still very much ‚Äòalive‚Äô and being worn to this day. Some objects have even become fashionable. The installation‚Äôs idea is linked to the development of ideas and aesthetic practices related to the cold, freezing and warming. We explored the basic differences between Russian culture and other cultures in respect of how other cultures look at death. Russia‚Äôs cold climate makes the figure of a man dying from freezing cold a very important theme in Russian culture (in Russian fairy tales, in coachman‚Äôs songs, in poems by Nikolay Nekrasov ‚ÄòGrandfather Frost- Red Nose‚Äô and so on ... ). Death by freezing is one of the most blissful forms of dying. A person dying from freezing does not feel pain; he experiences euphoria and pleasant hallucinations. This characterises a more painless attitude towards death in Russian culture in comparison with the European culture which is in many ways built on pain and suffering. Here it is relevant to recall the work of Vladimir Nabokov, who considered that the message of all of his literary work consisted in the phrase ‚ÄòDeath is sweet; this is a secret‚Äô. Nabokov enciphered this phrase into one of his stories\\".Pavel Pepperstein, 17 December 2009, for the exhibition A History of Irritated Material, courtesy of Raven Row Gallery.  Side Space of the Sacred aka Amber Room  Side Space of the Sacred was created and shown in 1992 in Vienna. The design of the installation is quite simple. Located at the centre of the room are three smooth, large, white ‚ÄúKolobok spheres‚Äù with tranquil, sleeping faces (Kolobok is a character from Russian folklore, a round bread bun who runs away from the woman baking him and has numerous adventures). In the corners of the room there are four ‚Äúlittle altars‚Äù. Each ‚Äúlittle altar‚Äù includes an Orthodox icon, a red cushion, a small dish, and a wrinkled apple. IMH in their introduction to the installation catalogue explain their idea as follows: ‚ÄúIn speaking of the installation 'The Side Space of the Sacred', the very first thing to note is that, like most of our exhibition works, it possesses both 'internal' and 'external' functions simultaneously. Both functions are fundamentally illustrative. The ‚Äúexternal‚Äù function is basically an illustration of several hallucinatory plotlines, existing at the level of fundamental patternings of delirium on the ethno-semiotic plane, and, moreover, they exist not as ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù components of these ‚Äúnarratives from the collective depths‚Äù, but as cavities, defects, whispers, cracks, parasitic ‚Äúsubplots‚Äù and other flaws of these narratives. Art, like hallucinosis, encounters in the first instance the spatial and acoustic parameters of all these ‚Äúlower-depths events‚Äù, and therefore the metaphor of ‚Äúparasites that leave tunnels in the compacted strata‚Äù is entirely appropriate, as is the metaphor of ‚Äúcracks in the foundation‚Äù. It is ‚Äúhallucinations on a global theme‚Äù that are illustrated. The important thing here is the conceptual background of ‚Äúcommon doings and things‚Äù which pervade ‚Äúcommon bodies and spaces‚Äù through and through. Naturally, these global themes can be themes of the state, religion, money, the city, war and so on. What is important for us is that the unfolding of these hallucinations inevitably results in a comic effect (since this is an unfolding inwards into the banal). The psychodelicised levels of consciousness that have engendered these visions create them, in a certain sense, as ‚Äúself-caricatures‚Äù. The other, ‚Äúinternal‚Äù function of this installation is to illustrate the plotlines of our own text- formation, as performed within the framework of Medical Hermeneutics Inspection‚Äôs ‚Äúlaboratory of discourses‚Äù. From the viewpoint of this ‚Äúinternal‚Äù function, each element of the installation appears as a quotation from or reference to one or another of our texts (either already written or as yet only planned, and sometimes existing as a memory of an oral discussion). This kind of ‚Äúreading‚Äù of our texts is in effect possible only for ourselves and also, perhaps, for certain of our close friends and co-authors. It is this that gives rise to the requirement for textual commentaries ‚Äúfor the catalogue‚Äù, by means of which this ‚Äúlaboratory‚Äù space of intersecting and unfolding or, on the contrary, stagnating discourses can be engaged as the exhibition background of the work itself\\".Introduction, Exhibition catalogue, Blickwinkel Das Sakrale in Der USSR, Galerie Grita Insam, Wien, 1992.  The Alley of Longevity aka The Pipe  The Alley of Longevity was created in 1995 for an exhibition in Prague called ‚ÄòFlight, Departure, Disappearance‚Äô, curated by Milena Slavicka. It has since been presented in several important exhibitions in the Czech Republic, Germany and Switzerland, including at Art Basel Unlimited. The installation consists of a wide tube hung at eye level surrounded by portrait drawings of babies and elderly men. Visitors can look through the pipe using binoculars. Inside, a small light bulb illuminates the scene of a cozy furnished room. In terms of the well-known metaphor ‚Äúthe light at the end of the tunnel‚Äù Pepperstein and Anufriev reinterpreted an ordinary object as a much more significant and sophisticated thing: as an attempt to find out what is at ‚Äúthe end‚Äù. The installation gives everyone the opportunity to pass along the Alley and momentarily come close to the final moment, which seems to be a quiet, beautiful, perfect place. But make only one step to the side, and this little paradise will disappear, revealing the mythological figure of the ‚ÄúKolobkovost‚Äù or ‚ÄúEscape‚Äù, a recurring theme in the aesthetics of the Moscow conceptual school. The installation reflects the ideas and concepts of Medical Hermeneutics, and in particular is connected with the art movement of psychedelic realism. Articulating such categories as distance, time and disappearance, the artists reduced their size to infinity and embody a conceptual view of issues of life, death and immortality. This idea is revealed in the portrait gallery of the elderly men, whose ages reach astronomical numbers, and their infant counterparts, whose ages impossibly span backwards into minus figures, before they could be born. The Medical Hermeneutic group‚Äôs characters are outside of the past and future. They are the embodiment of eternity.http://www.reginagallery.com/exhibitions/21/  Exhibitions  2015 * t:h:e r:e:a:l:after psychedelia.

He is considered by drama historians as one of the three founders of Chinese spoken drama, together with Tian Han and Hong Shen. He was also one of the top Peking opera performers, regarded as a southern counterpart of Mei Lanfang. Ouyang Yuqian was the founding president of the Central Academy of Drama from 1950 until his death in 1962. He also served as vice chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, vice chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association, and chairman of the Chinese Dancers Association. Names Ouyang Yuqian's name at birth was Ouyang Liyuan (), and his hao was Nanjie (). He also used the stage names and pen names including Lanrong (), Liansheng (), and Taohua Buyi'an Zhu (). Early life and education Ouyang Yuqian born on 12 May 1889 into a wealthy and highly educated family in Liuyang, Hunan Province. His father was Ouyang Ligeng (), and mother Liu Yixia (). His grandfather Ouyang Zhonghu () was a scholar who served as governor of Guilin Prefecture during the Qing dynasty. When he was 15, Ouyang went to study in Japan. He graduated from Seijo School (ÊàêÂüéÂ≠¶Ê†°) in Tokyo, and then studied business at Meiji University and literature at Waseda University. In 1906, Ouyang and other Chinese students in Japan co-founded the Spring Willow Society (Êò•Êü≥Á§æ, Chunliu She), which marked the beginning of modern Chinese theatre. Career  Early career ‚Äî Peking opera and drama  dan role in a Peking opera He returned to China in 1911 and founded the New Play Comrade Society () with his Spring Willow colleague Lu Jingruo (). They later established the Spring Willow Theatre in Shanghai, but it went out of business when Lu died in 1915. In 1914, Ouyang Yuqian began to write and act in Peking operas. From 1914 to 1928, he wrote 18 operas, and directed and performed in 29. He also adapted more than 50 traditional stories into Peking opera, including many from the classic novel Dream of the Red Chamber. His acting was so highly acclaimed that he was considered the southern counterpart of the master Mei Lanfang. In 1918, he was invited by Zhang Jian to establish an actors' school and the Gengsu Theatre () in Nantong, Jiangsu. Although a famous Peking opera performer, Ouyang was also active in promoting the \\"New Play\\" (spoken drama). He joined several New Play societies in the 1910s and co-founded several pioneering drama troupes, including the Masses Theatre Society, the Drama Cooperative Society (), and the Southern Drama Society. During this period, he collaborated with like-minded dramatists and directors Hong Shen, Ying Yunwei, Zhang Shichuan, Zheng Zhengqiu, and Zhou Jianyun. In 1922, he wrote the play After Returning Home (), considered one of the earliest satirical comedies in China. In his 1928 play Pan Jinlian, he depicted Pan Jinlian, the archetypal femme fatale of classical Chinese culture, as a free-spirited woman victimized by a male-dominated traditional society. He played the title role himself.  1920s and 1930s ‚Äî film and drama  Ouyang Yuqian After Zhang, Zheng, and Zhou started the Mingxing Film Company in 1922, they invited Ouyang Yuqian to join their studio, but Ouyang declined because, according to himself, he was earning a \\"substantial salary\\" as a Peking opera performer. He did help out on several occasions, but at the same time wrote three films for the rival China Sun Motion Picture Company from 1926 to 1928. He acted in two of the three films, Why Not Her? () and A Wandering Songstress (), and directed the third, Three Years Later (). In 1929, Ouyang Yuqian was invited by Chen Mingshu, chairman of Guangdong Province, to establish the Guangdong Drama Research Institute in Guangzhou. His political view turned increasingly left-wing, especially after the 1932 Japanese attack of Shanghai. He joined the Left-Wing Dramatist League in Guangzhou and participated in the first drama festival in the Soviet Union. In 1933, he joined Chen Mingshu's Fujian Rebellion, and was forced to escape to Japan after its failure. After returning to Shanghai in 1934, Ouyang Yuqian joined Xinhua Film Company and wrote his first sound film New Peach Blossom Fan (). In 1935, he joined Mingxing, by then one of the largest Chinese film studios, and helped the studio secure a crucial bank loan using his own family resources. He made three films with Mingxing: Qingming Festival (), Xiao Lingzi (), and Red Haitang ().  Japanese invasion and Civil War  Ouyang Yuqian joined Lianhua Film Company in 1937. While he was shooting the film So Busy (), the Empire of Japan launched a full-scale invasion of Shanghai, which destroyed most of the city's film studios. After Japan occupied the Chinese sections of Shanghai, Ouyang made several anti-Japanese plays in the Shanghai International Settlement, before fleeing to British Hong Kong, where he wrote the screenplay for the patriotic film Mulan Joins the Army. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Ouyang Yuqian spent most of his time in Guilin, Guangxi in southwest China, which was largely free from Japanese occupation. He studied Guilin opera and established a school for the art. He established Guangxi Provincial Art Museum in 1940, and an art theatre 1944. In 1944, he and Tian Han organized the First Southwest Opera Expo in Guilin, which lasted three months and attracted almost a thousand performers. After the surrender of Japan at the end of World War II, he returned to Shanghai in 1946 and served as the playwright-director of New China Drama Society (). He also taught at Shanghai Experimental School of Drama. In January 1947, he led a delegation to perform in Taiwan, but had to leave when the February 28 Incident broken out. Because of the Chinese Civil War, Ouyang left again for Hong Kong, and worked as the screenwriter-director of Yonghua Film Company.  People's Republic of China  Ouyang Yuqian and Mei Lanfang in 1956 In March 1949, he was invited by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to attend the first Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. He was elected director of the Chinese National Opera Improvement Committee and a Standing Committee member of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. Ouyang Yuqian became the founding president of Central Academy of Drama in April 1950. He joined the Communist Party of China in 1955. He also served as vice chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, vice chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association, and chairman of the Chinese Dancers Association. He was a member of the first National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the first and second National People's Congress. In his later years, he published several memoirs and books on film and drama theory, and a book on Tang dynasty dances. On 21 September 1962, Ouyang Yuqian died of an illness in Beijing. Personal life Ouyang Yuqian and wife Liu Yunqiu Ouyang Yuqian married Liu Yunqiu (), also known as Liu Wenqiu (), in 1906. They had a daughter, Ouyang Jingru (Chinese: Ê¨ßÈò≥Êï¨Â¶Ç; 13 September 1928 ‚Äì 2013) and an adopted son Ouyang Shanzun (; 24 May 1914 ‚Äì 2 July 2009), who was also a dramatist.

This distance function is defined on the collection of chambers in a mathematical structure known as a building, and its value on a pair of chambers a minimal sequence of reflections (in the Weyl group) to go from one chamber to the other. An adjacent sequence of chambers in a building is known as a gallery, so the Weyl distance function is a way of encoding the information of a minimal gallery between two chambers. In particular, the number of reflections to go from one chamber to another coincides with the length of the minimal gallery between the two chambers, and so gives a natural metric (the gallery metric) on the building. According to , the Weyl distance function is something like a geometric vector: it encodes both the magnitude (distance) between two chambers of a building, as well as the direction between them. Definitions We record here definitions from . Let be the Coxeter complex associated to a group W generated by a set of reflections S. The vertices of are the elements of W, and the chambers of the complex are the cosets of S in W. The vertices of each chamber can be colored in a one-to-one manner by the elements of S so that no adjacent vertices of the complex receive the same color. This coloring, although essentially canonical, is not quite unique. The coloring of a given chamber is not uniquely determined by its realization as a coset of S. But once the coloring of a single chamber has been fixed, the rest of the Coxeter complex is uniquely colorable. Fix such a coloring of the complex. A gallery is a sequence of adjacent chambers :C_0,C_1,dots,C_n. Because these chambers are adjacent, any consecutive pair C_{i-1},C_i of chambers share all but one vertex. Denote the color of this vertex by s_i. The Weyl distance function between C_0 and C_n is defined by :delta(C_0,C_n) = s_1s_2cdots s_n. It can be shown that this does not depend on the choice of gallery connecting C_0 and C_n. Now, a building is a simplicial complex that is organized into apartments, each of which is a Coxeter complex (satisfying some coherence axioms). Buildings are colorable, since the Coxeter complexes that make them up are colorable. A coloring of a building is associated with a uniform choice of Weyl group for the Coxeter complexes that make it up, allowing it to be regarded as a collection of words on the set of colors with relations. Now, if C_0,dots,C_n is a gallery in a building, then define the Weyl distance between C_0 and C_n by :delta(C_0,C_n) = s_1s_2cdots s_n where the s_i are as above. As in the case of Coxeter complexes, this does not depend on the choice of gallery connecting the chambers C_0 and C_n. The gallery distance d(C_0,C_n) is defined as the minimal word length needed to express delta(C_0,C_n) in the Weyl group. Symbolically, d(C_0,C_n)=ell(delta(C_0,C_n)). Properties The Weyl distance function satisfies several properties that parallel those of distance functions in metric spaces: * delta(C,D) = 1 if and only if C=D (the group element 1 corresponds to the empty word on S). This corresponds to the property d(C,D)=0 if and only if C=D of the gallery metric : * delta(C,D)=delta(D,C)^{-1} (inversion corresponds to reversal of words in the alphabet S). This corresponds to symmetry d(C,D)=d(D,C) of the gallery metric. * If delta(C',C)=sin S and delta(C,D)=w, then delta(C',D) is either w or sw. Moreover, if ell(sw)=ell(w)+1, then delta(C',D)=sw. This corresponds to the triangle inequality. Abstract characterization of buildings In addition to the properties listed above, the Weyl distance function satisfies the following property: * If delta(C,D)=w, then for any sin S there is a chamber C', such that delta(C',C)=s and delta(C',D)=sw. In fact, this property together with the two listed in the \\"Properties\\" section furnishes an abstract \\"metrical\\" characterization of buildings, as follows. Suppose that (W,S) is a Coxeter system consisting of a Weyl group W generated by reflections belonging to the subset S. A building of type (W,S) is a pair consisting of a set C of chambers and a function: :delta:Ctimes Cto W such that the three properties listed above are satisfied. Then C carries the canonical structure of a building, in which is the Weyl distance function. References * External links * Mike Davis, Cohomology of Coxeter groups and buildings, MSRI 2007.

Buck's of Woodside is a restaurant in Woodside, California, that has gained fame as a meeting place for venture capitalists and tech entrepreneurs. Like nearby Sand Hill Road, Buck's has become a fixture of Silicon Valley. About Owner Jamis MacNiven left his career in construction to open the restaurant in 1991. Unhappy with local restaurants, MacNiven decided to create his own. By 1995, when the dot- com boom began, word of mouth spread that Buck's was a hotspot for Silicon Valley's most powerful. The restaurant is close to both Sand Hill Road‚Äîhome to the majority of Silicon Valley's venture capitalists‚Äîand Stanford University. Netscape, PayPal, Hotmail and Tesla Motors are among the companies whose entrepreneurs held early meetings at Buck's. \\"Breakfast at Buck's\\" is the title of the introduction of the book, The Startup Game: Inside the Partnership between Venture Capitalists and Entrepreneurs, by venture capitalist Bill Draper. In 2003, Forbes magazine named Buck's one of its top business restaurants. The interior of Buck's features colorful decor, including cowboy boots, a talking buffalo head, a model of the Statue of Liberty wearing a sombrero, and a stuffed alligator. According to MacNiven, Steve Jobs is one of the few Silicon Valley icons who never set foot in his restaurant; MacNiven and the Apple co-founder had a falling out in the 1980s after Jobs hired him to remodel his house. Buck's nevertheless has a rare photo of Jobs, wearing a set of Groucho glasses, on display. When the COVID19 pandemic hit in the spring of 2020, and the resulting restaurant shut-down, Jamis MacNiven decided to retire. In August 2020 Buck's was re-opened by his sons who now run it.

It is a single story brick building, finished with wood and granite trim. Its north-facing main facade is three bays wide, and has a projecting gable end supported by Doric columns at the corners, with a center entry vestibule that is flush to the gable end. A wood frame addition extends behind and to the west of the main block. Built in 1841, this building is one of Norridgewock's better-preserved Greek Revival buildings. It was built by John S. Abbott, a prominent local lawyer who used it as his office. It was owned during the 19th century by a succession of lawyers, the last being Stephen Decatur Lindsey, who was married to the sister of Rebecca Sophia Clarke. Clarke, a Norridgewock native who lived nearby, inherited the building, and donated it to the town for use as a library in 1903.

The warm period lies wholly within the Matuyama epoch, in which the earth's magnetic field, with a few exceptions, had a different polarity from that today: the magnetic north pole (actually corresponding to the magnetic south) lay near the geographic south pole.

The popular sight was created in the 15th century by digging cellars called ‚Äúloch‚Äù, under houses in the historic district of T√°bor, in the Old town. Many cellars were connected and created a kind of a labyrinth. Some of the cellars reach a considerable size. Thanks to the constant and relatively low temperature and constant humidity, the cellars were used for storing foodstuff, especially beer. In the case of an enemy threat or large fires, people also used them as a safe shelter.

According to some scholars, the Hussite in the times of leader Jan ≈Ωi≈æka were carried this ark before the army. It is loaded with tremendous energy, which made the Hussite army became invincible.

It was once a flourishing ancient port city known as Kaveri poompattinam, which for a while served as the capital of the early Chola kings in Tamilakam. Puhar is located near the end point of the Kaveri river, aside the sea coast. It is mentioned in the Periplus of Ereythrean sea. It is now established by marine archeological research conducted by the National institute of marine archeology, Goa that much of the town was washed away by progressive erosion and floods. Submerged wharves and several meter lengths of pier walls have excavated in recent times have corroborated the literary references to Poompugar. It was rebuilt several times after that. Ancient Pottery dating back to the 4th century BCE have been discovered off shore by marine archeologists east of this town. City layout The general plan of the city of Puhar is described in considerable detail in the fifth book of Silapathikaram (c. ). The town was built on the north banks of the river Kaveri. The town had two distinct districts, Maruvurpakkam near the sea and Pattinappakkam to its west. These two villages were separated by a stretch of gardens and orchards where daily markets were held under the shades of the trees. The market place was known as Naalangadi during the day and as allangadi by night. After 2004 Tsunami Poompuhar Beach Maruvurpakkam The district of Maruvurpakkam was near the beach and had several terraced mansions and warehoused with windows shaped like the eyes of the deer. Maruvurpakkam being close to the shore and hence to the shipyard was naturally preferred by the many overseas travellers, merchants and yavanas (foreigner) whose pleasant features arrested the eyes of the spectators living close to each other. Maruvurpakkam was inhabited by the fisher folk. The town had several warehouses. Weavers, silk merchants, vendors, fish and meat sellers, potters, grain merchants, jewellers and diamond makers lived in Maruvurppakkam.  Pattinappakkam  The King and nobles, rich traders, physicians, astrologers, members of the king's army, court dancers occupied Pattinappakkam. The five Manrams - Vellidai Manram, Elanchi Manram, Nedankal manram, Poothachathukkam and Pavaimanram were located in Pattinappakkam. Gardens like Elavanthikaicholai, Uyyanam, Chanpathivanam, Uvavanam, and Kaveravanam added beauty to the town. In culture The city of poompuhar is a very ancient one. Legends relate how great Muchukunda chola of solar race once led his troops to guard kingdom of lord indra namely amaravathi in battle against some powerful demons who were in possession of very destructive weapons. The king and his soldiers held guard without sleeping for 3600 years and as a matter of gratitude lord Indra king of devas ordered his chief engineer viswakarma to build the city on the same lines of amaravati. He also presented the king with sivalingam that he personally worshipped. The great Tamil work Silappathikaram says that in puhar ships creaked in with wealth from all 7 continents, that devas in guise of humans came and worshipped in its temples and that the nights were so bright that even a small grain of white lentil dropped in the beach sand could be spotted by naked eye. Descriptions in Tamil poetic works A Purananuru poem (poem 30) says that big ships entered the port of Puhar without slacking sail, and poured out onto the beach precious merchandise brought from overseas. In the extensive markets of Puhar there were many tall mansions surrounded by platforms reached by high ladders. These mansions had many apartments and were provided with doorways, great and small, and with wide hallways and corridors (Pattinappaalai ‚Äì II ‚Äì142-158). In all parts of the town there were flags flying of various kinds and shapes. Pattinappaalai, a poem that describes the ancient Puhar very vividly, was written by the poet Kadiyalur Uruthirangannanaar is part of the Ten Idylls anthology and was sung in praise of Karikala Chola, a second-century Chola king. Merchants of Puhar Pattinappaalai also gives an idealised description of the merchants plying their trade in Puhar (Pattinappaalai ‚Äì II ‚Äì199-212): :They shunned murder, and put aside theft, pleased the gods by fire offerings,‚Ä¶they regarded others rights as scrupulously as their own, they took nothing more than was due to them and never gave less than was due from them. Trading thus in many articles of merchandise, they enjoyed an ancient heritage of prosperity and lived in close proximity to one another. City's destruction The ancient city of Puhar was destroyed by the sea around 300 BC. Marine archeologists from the National Institute of Oceanography have established that this could have been the effects of sediment erosion and periodic tsunamis. Such a tsunami is mentioned in the Tamil poem Manimekhalai (see below), which relates that the town KƒÅveripattinam or PuhƒÅr was swallowed up by the sea. This event is supported by archeological finds of submerged ruins off the coast of modern Poompuhar.Gaur A.

After playing a leading part in the Burning of Derry, he was captured and executed following the Battle of Kilmacrennan. Tyrone's Rebellion The MacDavitts were from Inishowen, in northern Donegal, directly north of the English bastion of Derry. They were foster brothers (some sources say foster fathers) of Cahir O'Doherty, who had the strongest claim to succeed as head of the O'Dohertys. When Red Hugh O'Donnell kidnapped Cahir during Tyrone's Rebellion, Phelim Reagh and his brother Hugh Boy MacDavitt changed sides, having previously supported the Irish cause. They now rescued Cahir from captivity and had him proclaimed head of the O'Dohertys by Henry Docwra, English governor of Derry. Both Cahir and his foster brothers served with distinction on the Crown's side during the war.Falls p.272-74 They were disappointed when the Treaty of Mellifont 1603 restored lands to the rebels that had been promised to them. Both Cahir O'Doherty and Phelim Reagh had problems with local government officials in the years after the war, once the more friendly Docwra had been replaced, and both felt they were being pushed into rebellion by their treatment. This came to a head when O'Doherty was ordered to hand over Phelim Reagh because he wanted for arrest over allegations that had been made. O'Doherty reluctantly turned him over, but applied for his release. Eventually his lobbying was successful, and he was freed, just in time for him to take part in the rebellion.McCavitt p.138 O'Doherty's Rebellion Burning of Derry O'Doherty planned to begin the rebellion by seizing the garrison town of Derry. MacDavitt helped lead the initial attack and capture of the Upper Fort of Derry. He was on hand when the Governor George Paulet (who was disliked by both Protestant settlers and Gaelic inhabitants) was killed. Derry was then burned to the ground.Bardon p.102-03 Kilmacrennan MacDavitt was at the decisive battle fought near Kilmacrennan where O'Doherty was killed and the rebels suffered a heavy defeat. After the battle, MacDavitt was cornered by a group of soldiers. He put up fierce resistance and was wounded and captured. MacDavitt was the most senior rebel to be executed. He was taken to Lifford, found guilty by a civilian court, and sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered. His and O'Doherty's severed heads were exhibited on spikes on at the gates of Dublin, a common revenge on those accused of treason at the time. The participation of Phelim Reagh MacDavitt and others of the MacDavitts in the attack and destruction of Derry led to them becoming known as the \\"burn-Derrys\\".

Bossa Antigua and the Jazz Bossa Nova Movement of the early 1960s From 1962 to 1964, jazz saxophonist Stan Getz popularized the bossa nova style in North America and Europe through a series of albums and single releases. Getz's first hit record in the style was \\"Desafinado\\", which became popular in the summer of 1962. In the North American jazz scene, 1962 and 1963 saw the releases of several albums by jazz saxophonists incorporating the style in the wake of Getz's success. Among those albums were Desmond's Take Ten (recorded in the summer of 1963), Zoot Sims' New Beat Bossa Nova: Samba Swings (recorded August 1962), Coleman Hawkins' Desafinado (recorded September 1962), Gene Ammons' Bad! Bossa Nova (recorded September, 1962), Ike Quebec's Soul Samba (recorded October 1962), and Cannonball Adderley's Cannonball's Bossa Nova (recorded December 1962). Getz's biggest bossa nova success was his 1964 recording of the The Girl from Ipanema, which peaked at number five in the U.S. on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart on July 17 of that year. Desmond recorded the majority of the music released on \\"Bossa Antigua\\" between July 28 and September 8 1964, at the height of the style's U.S. popularity.

Established in 1896, it is one of the oldest golf clubs in the state. Its 18-hole course was laid out in two stages, with its original nine holes designed by Alexander H. Findley in 1900, and later redesigned and expanded by Walter Travis. The club has long been a social scene for the summer elite of the Kennebunkport area, notably including former United States President George H. W. Bush. The club was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. Description and history The Cape Arundel Golf Club is located on the north bank of the Kennebunk River on the inland portion of Kennebunkport, abutting the neighboring town of Arundel. It is set on , between two tidal branches of the river, one of which further branches, partially dividing the property. The property is roughly bisected by the main drive, which provides access to the clubhouse, a Craftsman/Bungalow style building built in 1900 and enlarged about 1920, with an interior last remodeled in the 1980s. The building presents a single story in three directions, but has a two-story frontage overlooking the river, where its site drops off steeply. President George H. W. Bush plays on the course. The club was established in 1896 by the residents of the Cape Arundel Summer Colony, a coastal resort area of lavish summer \\"cottages\\" catering to the wealthy. The clubhouse was built in 1900, designed by Prosper L. Senat, and the first nine holes were formally laid out that year. In the early 1920s the club hired Walter Travis to expand the course to eighteen holes. This was accomplished in part by reversing the order of the original nine, which are located east of the access drive, and building the back nine to its west. The course is a modified links-style course, which Travis modeled on traditional Scottish seaside courses. The design involved only limited alteration to the landscape, typically the addition of mounds to the relatively flat terrain. Its greens are small, and are sometimes obscured from view from the fairway, requiring players to plan their shots with care. Play is affected both by wind conditions and the state of the tides along the river.

He was born in Westbury, Shropshire, the only son of coal merchant John Pugh and educated at Welshpool County School and the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, where he graduated BA in Geography in 1914. However, he was inspired to study geology by Professor Owen Thomas Jones. In 1915, they presented their first joint study (of the geology of the area around Machynlleth) to the Geological Society of London. During World War I, he served with the Royal Welch Fusiliers as a staff officer, rising to the rank of major. He was awarded OBE in the 1919 New Year Honours, the French Croix de Guerre and was twice mentioned in despatches. After the war he returned to University College as Professor of Geology from 1919 to 1931, acting as Dean of the Faculty of Science from 1929 to 1931. During this time he carried out field studies to map the chronostratigraphy of the ancient Ordovician-Silurian rocks of the Corris and Bala districts and in 1928 was awarded a DSc by the University of Wales. In 1931 he was appointed Professor of Geology and Director of the Geological Laboratories at the University of Manchester, a post he held until 1950. He served as Dean of the Faculty of Science there from 1939 to 1941, as Pro-Vice Chancellor from 1941 to 1943 and as Deputy Vice-Chancellor from 1943 to 1950. As a member of the Inter-University Council for Higher Education in the Colonies he went to Malaya in 1947 with the Commission on Higher Education to advise on university development there. He was elected president of Section C (Geology) of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (1948‚Äì49). In 1951 he was made Emeritus Professor when he resigned to become Director of the Geological Survey of Great Britain and of the Museum of Practical Geology (1951‚Äì60). He commenced the task of producing a geological map of the country and was also responsible for the Water Department and the Atomic Energy Division. The activities of the institution included the undertaking of field studies in six other countries across the world for the Atomic Energy Division and an aeromagnetic survey of England and Wales, which involved surveying the Cheshire salt fields and the mapping of coalfields and advisory work for the National Coal Board, the Scottish Hydro-electric Board and the Ministry of Housing. He published many papers in scientific journals reporting on the progress of this work. Honours and awards He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1951 for his contributions to the advancement of geological sciences and awarded the Murchison Medal by the Geological Society of London in 1952 for his studies on the stratigraphy and tectonics of the lower Palaeozoic Rocks of Wales. He was knighted in the 1956 Birthday Honours. Private life He retired in 1960 and died in London in 1974.

He was the most prominent Armenian leader of the Lebanese Communist Party. He was seen as the 'right hand' of Syrian communist leader Khalid Bakdash. Youth Madoyan was the son of a refugee shoe-maker from Adana. In his youth Madoyan was a Huntchag, but later became a communist. He studied in Istanbul and was a member of the Huntchag Social Democratic Students Union. Madoyan befriended Bedik Torossian, who later became a leader of the Armenian Communist Party. Spartak and foundation of the Communist Party In the summer of 1922 Madoyan moved to Beirut, where his family had sought refuge. In 1922 the Huntchag Social Democratic Students Union set up a branch in Beirut with Madoyan as its secretary. In 1923 the Huntchag Students Union branch was dissolved as Madoyan and Haykazun Boyadian founded the Armenian communist organization Spartak Youth. The organization maintained links with the Armenian Communist Party and the French Communist Party. It consisted of workers and students and had some fifteen members in Beirut as well as cells in Aleppo, Alexandretta, Mosul and Zahle. Madoyan was the general secretary of Spartak. In 1925 Spartak merged with the Lebanese People's Party, forming the Syrian-Lebanese Communist Party. Madoyan was one of the six members of the first Central Committee of the party. At the time Madoyan was a medical student at Universit√© Saint-Joseph. Underground work Madoyan established links with Sultan al-Atrash and cooperated in arms smuggling between Beirut and Jebel Druze during the 1925-1927 Syrian revolt. Madoyan was arrested by French authorities in 1926.Messerlian, Zaven. Armenian Participation in the Lebanese Legislative Elections 1934‚Äì2009. Beirut: Haigazian University Press, 2014. pp. 45, 47, 49 When the Central Committee was re-organized in 1928, Madoyan remained a member of it. In 1931 Madoyan introduced Khalid Bakdash to the Central Committee, Bakdash soon thereafter became general secretary of the party. Bakdash stayed in Moscow from December 1933 to 1937, he became the permanent representative of the Arab communist parties to the Communist International (Comintern) in 1934 on Madoyan's suggestion. In Bakdash's absence, Madoyan ran the day-to-day affairs of the party along with Farajallah al-Hulo and Nicola Shawi. Madoyan proposed towards Comintern the formation of a federation of Arab communist parties with a common leadership, but this idea was not approved by the Comintern leadership due to security concerns. 1934 election Madoyan contested the Beirut Armenian Orthodox seat in the 1934 Lebanese parliamentary election. He stood on the same list as Saadeddine Moumne (also a Communist Party member) and Ibrahim Haddad. Their campaign called for a worker-peasant alliance to achieve national independence, land reform, democratic freedoms and labour rights. Madoyan obtained 565 votes in the first round, 264 of them from the Medawar neighbourhood. In the second round, he obtained 180 votes. Interim party leader Under Madoyan's leadership the party developed a role in the nascent labour movement and as well as becoming an important actor in the 1936 Syrian revolt. In February 1938 the Armenian communist weekly Joghovourti Tsayn ('Voice of the People') was founded with Madoyan as its editor. 1943 election In June 1943, the Communist Party presented Madoyan as its candidate for the Beirut Armenian Orthodox seat in the 1943 parliamentary election. However, on August 27, 1943 Madoyan's candidature was withdrawn.Messerlian, Zaven. Armenian Participation in the Lebanese Legislative Elections 1934‚Äì2009. Beirut: Haigazian University Press, 2014. pp. 63, 111, 115-116 Joint Secretariat The Syrian-Lebanese Communist Party was divided into separate Lebanese and Syrian parties in 1944 (albeit still in a union of sorts). However, in August 1950 the decision to split the parties was reversed, with the formation of a joint secretariat for both Syria and Lebanon. The secretariat consisted of Bakdash, Madoyan and Hasan Qraytim. 1951 election Ahead of the 1951 parliamentary election, Madoyan was again fielded as a candidate for a Beirut Armenian Orthodox seat. He obtained 2,765 votes (12.6% of the cast votes in Beirut). 1953 election In the 1953 parliamentary election the Ramgavar-Huntchag-Independent Group bloc had opted not to field any candidate of their own for the Bourj Hammoud electoral district Armenian Orthodox seat. The Communist Party sought to take advantage of this situation by fielding Madoyan there. In his memoirs, Madoyan later stated that the Communist Party had proposed his candidature against his will. A day before the election, police arrested twenty-five of Madoyan's campaigners in Bourj Hammoud. Madoyan lodged a protest at the Ministry of Justice against the arrests. Madoyan, the sole contender against the incumbent Dikran Tosbath, obtained 709 votes (15.11%).Messerlian, Zaven. Armenian Participation in the Lebanese Legislative Elections 1934‚Äì2009. Beirut: Haigazian University Press, 2014. pp. 126, 129-130 In 1954 Madoyan along with Qraitim, al-Hulo and Shawi signed a party statement. As the party was banned at the time, the Lebanese government charged Madoyan and the other signatories under martial law. They were given 1-month prison sentences in absentia. 20th Soviet party congress In 1956 Madoyan attended the 20th congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union along with Bakdash, Shawi and Yusuf Faisal. 1963 jail sentence In 1963 Madoyan was sentenced to one year in jail for having spoken in defence of the Communist Party.

Founded in 2013 with initial funding from the British government of ¬£150,000, but with the majority of its funding coming from the private sector, it was proposed in the Hargreaves Review which recommended the creation of an \\"industry-led\\" body, dubbed the Digital Copyright Exchange by Hargreaves, to make licensing more convenient. The Copyright Hub teamed up with the Digital Catapult, a UK government innovation agency, which took on responsibility for developing the open source technology which would deliver the Hub's vision. The idea was to make it easy and free for anyone to attach an identifier to any piece of content, and then to create a record with the Copyright Hub which would link that identifier to an authoritative record of information about the piece of content and its owner.

After working with the Digital Catapult for about two years, The Copyright Hub separated and took over responsibility for developing and maintaining the technology which the Catapult had created at an estimated cost of ¬£2m. Delays in the delivery of the technology by the Catapult necessitated additional funding, restructuring and downsizing for the Copyright Hub. Some new funding was provided by the Intellectual Property Office in the UK, who also took a seat on the board and took responsibility for appointing a Chairman. It planned to create a browser extension and an online copyright ownership database, the plugin talking to the database to allow Internet users to conveniently license copyrighted works such as images. The planned launch date was January 2016. Revised plug-ins for Chrome and Firefox were launched in early 2018. It is still working on its technology, largely through the EU-funded ARDITO project.

She is the youngest chief prosecutor of any major American city. Early life Born Marilyn James in Massachusetts, she was raised in Dorchester, Boston by her grandparents. Her mother, Linda Thompson, was 17 when Mosby was born. Her mother and father both served as police officers; her family traces its association with the police for two generations, as her grandfather was one of the first African-American police officers in the state. She attended Dover- Sherborn High School, an hour away from her home, as a result of METCO, the longest-standing school desegregation program in the country. She served in the Student Government Association, and was co-editor of the school newspaper. Her interest in practicing law was sparked by the murder of her 17-year-old cousin by another 17-year-old outside of her home. Her cousin was mistakenly identified as a drug dealer by his killer, and murdered. In 2000, when she was a 20-year-old Tuskegee University student, James appeared on the Judge Judy television show as a plaintiff, suing a roommate for damaging her property during summer break. She prevailed in the arbitration, and was awarded $1,700. She graduated magna cum laude from Tuskegee University with a (B.A.) degree; she earned a Juris Doctor from Boston College Law School in 2005. Career Mosby served as a law clerk and Assistant State's Attorney for Baltimore from 2005 to 2011. From 2001 to 2002 she was a paralegal coordinator and later field counsel for Liberty Mutual Insurance in 2012.LinkedIn Profile In 2003 she was a legal intern for the Major Crimes Unit of the United States Attorney's Office in Boston and a civil litigation attorney for the Boston College Legal Assistance Bureau. In 2004 she was a legal intern for the Homicide Division of the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office and for the Homicide Division of the United States Attorney's Office in Washington DC. From 2004 to 2005 she was a criminal defense attorney for the Dorchester District Court.  State's Attorney for Baltimore City  In 2013, Mosby announced plans to run for State's Attorney for the city of Baltimore. She ran against incumbent Gregg L. Bernstein in the Democratic primary, defeating him with 55 percent of the vote. She faced no opposition in the general election. Mosby won the general election, receiving 94 percent of the vote, defeating Independent Russell A. Neverdon Sr., who staged a write-in campaign. At the time of her election, Mosby was the youngest top prosecutor in a major US city. Mosby was sworn into office on January 8, 2015. Soon after her first term in office had begun, Mosby announced restructuring of her office that was inspired by ideas from prosecutors' offices in New York, Los Angeles, and Atlanta. Deputy State's Attorney Janice Bledsoe was named to oversee the new division of \\"criminal intelligence.\\" Mosby reestablished community liaison positions, which her predecessor had eliminated, to inform residents of developments in cases relevant to their neighborhood. She created the Policy and Legislative Affairs Unit to advocate for legislation to help keep residents safe and prosecute cases efficiently. Mosby pushed unsuccessfully for bills that would have allowed prosecutors to introduce prior accusations against serial sex offenders during trial, an issue which she raised during her campaign. In May 2015, she secured the conviction of Nelson Clifford, a sex-offender who was acquitted in four previous sexual assault cases involving a \\"consent\\" defense. After the verdict she stated, \\"While we were able to secure a guilty verdict in this case, we must still encourage our legislators in Annapolis to bring our predatory sexual assault laws in line with the federal statute. Clifford was sentenced to more than 30 years in prison.\\" In January 2019, she announced that her office would no longer prosecute individuals for marijuana possession (regardless of quantity). She added that she would vacate nearly 5,000 marijuana possession convictions. =Violent criminal prosecutions= Mosby campaigned on a promise to target and prosecute violent repeat offenders. Since her administration began in January 2015, she has successfully prosecuted a number of high-profile defendants, including Darryl Anderson, Capone Chase, Nelson Clifford, Mustafa Eraibi, and Cornell Harvey. She created the Criminal Strategies Unit, modeled after a similar unit in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, to harness the power of the community to identify and target violent repeat offenders. The Unit utilizes technology, data-analysis, and intelligence-gathering in combination with close relationships with community organizations to identify trends in crime and works with law enforcement to target those who perpetuate these trends. In response to a 2015 spike in violent crime in Baltimore, Mosby and newly appointed interim Police Commissioner Kevin Davis announced that prosecutors and police officers would co-locate inside of a 24-hour \\"war room\\" in which law enforcement would target violent repeat offenders around the clock. =Freddie Gray case= In 2015, Mosby charged six police officers, who had arrested Freddie Gray prior to his death, with a variety of crimes including second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter. David Jaros, an associate professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law, was reported as saying that Mosby quite possibly overcharged the officers, while noting this is absolutely typical in criminal cases involving defendants who are not police. Anonymous sources were reported by CNN as saying the Baltimore police's investigation does not support some of the charges brought against the officers. However, these sources are within the police department, and according to CNN, > Mosby has good reason to separate her probe from the police. There is > widespread community distrust of the police. And many critics say letting > police departments investigate themselves is partly why alleged excessive > use of force incidents by officers rarely draw serious punishment. Mosby defended the charges in a statement released through a spokesperson, and condemned the release of information as unethical. In a May 4, 2015, interview on Fox News, Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz said that he believes Mosby overcharged the officers in an attempt to satisfy protesters and prevent further disturbances. Former Baltimore Prosecutor Page Croyder wrote an op-ed in The Baltimore Sun in which she described Mosby's charges as reflecting \\"either incompetence or an unethical recklessness\\". Croyder said that Mosby circumvented normal procedures \\"to step into the national limelight\\", and that she \\"pandered to the public\\", creating an expectation of a conviction. On May 21, a grand jury indicted the officers on most of the original charges filed by Mosby, with the exception of the charges of illegal imprisonment and false arrest, and added charges of reckless endangerment to all the officers involved. In May 2015, Mosby appeared onstage at concert with the musician Prince, after which she was criticized for using the Freddie Gray incident for personal and political gain. The Baltimore Sun reported that Mosby received $12,000 in free travel to speak at events around the nation after the officers were charged. When asked to respond to the allegation from police that she does not support the police, Mosby called the notion 'absurd', citing her family's history of working in law enforcement. Mosby was criticized for ordering the increased police presence, in the same neighborhood where Gray was arrested, just weeks prior to the incident. William Porter was the first officer tried; this resulted in a hung jury, and the judge declared a mistrial in December 2015. The Baltimore Sun reported that Porter was within one vote of an acquittal on the most serious charge against him. The second trial of officers ended on May 11, 2016, when Officer Edward Nero was acquitted on all charges. His acquittal resulted in increased criticism of Mosby for having moved too quickly in charging the officers. The third trial ended on June 23, 2016, and Officer Goodson was acquitted on all counts. George Washington University Law School professor John F. Banzhaf III filed a complaint with the Maryland's Attorney Grievance Commission against Mosby, saying she did not have probable cause to charge six officers in the death of Freddie Gray, and also that she repeatedly withheld evidence from the officers' defense attorneys. Five of the six police officers charged by Mosby are suing her for malicious prosecution, defamation, and invasion of privacy. =Community outreach= Mosby started initiatives to engage the Baltimore community, including: * Aim to B'MORE ‚Äì Begun in the spring of 2015 to provide an alternative to incarceration and a criminal record for first-time, non-violent felony drug offenders. Eligible defendants are granted probation before judgment, and placed on three years of probation. During probation, defendants complete 150 hours of community service, job skills training, and GED testing and/or substance abuse treatment as needed. The Office of the State's Attorney partnered with local employers to secure full-time jobs for program participants following completion of their job skills training. If successful, after three years participants can apply to expunge their records. * Junior State's Attorney ‚Äì Launched in the summer of 2015, the program introduces up to 30 promising middle school students each summer to careers in the criminal justice field. * Community Day in Court ‚Äì In an effort to rebuild trust and faith in the criminal justice system, Mosby began holding quarterly Community Days in Court, bringing the public and law enforcement quarterly together to discuss issues plaguing the city. Personal life In 2005 James married Nick Mosby, a Maryland State Delegate. They have two daughters. They live in the Reservoir Hill neighborhood of Baltimore. She has used Mosby as her name professionally since then. In October 2020, a $45,000 tax lien was filed against the property of Marilyn Mosby and her husband, Maryland State Delegate Nick Mosby, for three years of unpaid federal taxes (2014, 2015, and 2016). Nick Mosby stated that he has been ‚Äúin ongoing conversations with the IRS‚Äù about resolving this issue.

The arid diagonal can be seen in the form of the almost contiguous zone of BWh and BWk climate running from Ecuador to Southern Patagonia. The Arid Diagonal () is a contiguous zone of arid and semi-arid climate that traverses South America from coastal Peru in the Northwest to Argentine Patagonia in Southeast including large swathes of Bolivia and Chile. The Arid Diagonal encompasses a number of deserts, for example: Sechura, Atacama, Monte and the Patagonian Desert. The Arid Diagonal acts to isolate the temperate and subtropical forests of Chile and southern Argentina from other forests of South America. Together with the Quaternary glaciations in the Southern Andes, the diagonal has controlled the distribution of vegetation throughout Chile and Argentina. Cause and origin The northern portion of the Arid Diagonal is a result of the blocking of the trade winds by the barrier formed by the Central Andes and the South Pacific High and to the south in the westerlies the rain shadow the Southern Andes casts over eastern Patagonia. South of Mendoza (32¬∞53' S), the driest parts of the diagonal move away from the Andes as the mountains lose height, causing some humidity to penetrate; thus, at more southern latitudes the driest parts of the diagonal lie on the Atlantic coast of Patagonia. The Arid Diagonal has existed since the Neogene. The origin of the aridity of northern part of the diagonal is linked to two geologic events: a) the rise of Andes‚Äîan event that led to the permanent block of both the westward flow of moisture along the tropics, and the eastward flow of moisture in Patagonia and b) the permanent intrusion of cold Antarctic waters (the Humboldt Current) along South America's west coast.

Shariy came to the fast food with his wife, who gave birth to a child a few months ago, reports in his blog at UP Alexander Chalenko - \\"An unknown man came to them and started insulting Anatoli's wife. After Anatoly asked him to calm down, the bullfighter pulled him out of the \\"McDonald's\\". Anatoly pulled a gun and shot him twice.\\" Later Sharij reported the incident to police. Shariy claims that the McDonald's shooting case was trumped up due to his investigation of illegal controlled substance trade, which he alleged was covered up by high rank members of Ukrainian law enforcement. Shariy's vs. the Ukrainian law enforcement and Shariy's asylum  Shariy sought and received the asylum in the European Union claiming persecution by the Ukrainian law enforcement for his journalist activities.\\"Ukrainian journalist seeks asylum in Lithuania\\" In 2011, together with the journalists of the 1+1 TV channel, Shariy carried out a series of investigations of the alleged protection of the illegal controlled substance trade in Kyiv pharmacies by the Office for Combating Illegal Drug Trafficking of the Ministry of Internam Affairs (Ukrainian abbreviation: UBNON). On June 7 2011, Shariy published the first part of the article \\"Does UBNON Spit in the Face of the Minister?\\". On June 11, Shariy was summoned for interrogation in the McDonald's shooting case, which had allegedly been closed already. On June 20, Shariy gave a press conference about the situation and claimed that the Ministry of Internal Affairs and UBNON ordered the pressure on him. The next day, June 21, the criminal case for hooliganism was initiated against Shariy related to McDonald's shooting. Next month Shariy with the journalists of the \\"1+1\\" TV channel issued several publications alleging the involvement of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in covering up illegal casinos in Kiev. On July 12, 2011, Shariy and the film crew of the \\"1+1\\" channel were locked on the casino premises. Shortly thereafter criminal investigators arrived and seized 34 slot machines and equipment with the video with the recordings of the hall, resulting in a criminal case on gambling business. On July 12, 2011 at 3:30 am, a few hours after the incident in the casino, a shot was fired at Shariy's car. The car was damaged, but the journalist was not injured. Shariy refused to write a statement and admit himself a victim. In October 2011, criminal case on an attempted assassination was opened. The car shooting incident was cited as an example of attacks on journalists in the Human Rights Watch report for year 2011.\\"World Report 2012: Ukraine Events of 2011\\", Human Rights Watch After the attempted murder Shariy continued his journalistic activities. On September 21, 2011, after another publication exposing corruption in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the case on the assassination attempt on Shariy was closed, and a criminal case was initiated against the journalist himself for \\"staging an assassination attempt\\". After being placed on the all-Ukrainian wanted list, Shariy left the country and asked for political asylum in the European Union. In 2012 he was granted asylum and received a permanent residency permit in Lithuania for 5 years.

Criticism of President Poroshenko Throughout the presidency of Petro Poroshenko, Anatoly Shariy has repeatedly criticized his activities, in particular the president's actions to resolve war in Donbass, the president's PR on these events, as well as PR on dubious successes and achievements that either were not such or were committed by predecessors of Poroshenko. Shariy alleges that in response to his criticism the presidential administration launched a campaign to discredit the journalist. In addition, the administration submitted a request to the Google corporation, in which it demanded to disclose the place of residence of the authors of several YouTube channels, among which was the channel of Anatoly Shariy. In response to these actions in December 2018, Anatoly Shariy offered UAH 15,000 to anyone who asks Poroshenko about the reasons for the persecution of blogger Shariy. In early 2019 in many cities of Ukraine this question was asked during meetings with the president. In a number of cases, there was an inadequate reaction of the president and his guards to this: the president's bodyguards knocked the phones out of the hands of the questioners, \\"the SBU officers beat the brave ones, and the president himself tore off their caps\\", slapped in the face and pinched those who voiced question. When in late February - early March 2019, journalists from website bihus.info published the correspondence of Ukroboronprom leaders who were engaged in money laundering on parts for military equipment purchased in Russia, Anatoly Shariy presented evidence that President Petro Poroshenko's company \\"Leninskaya Kuznya\\" took part in the laundering of the state budget of the country by selling obviously unusable spare parts at an overpriced (3-6 times) price.  Criticism of President Zelensky  Some time after the election of President Volodymyr Zelensky and of the dominating parliamentary majority of his party, Servant of the People, Shariy began to criticize the leaders of the party, the government formed by them, and in particular the Prosecutor General Ruslan Riaboshapka, who made a number of controversial decisions (refusing to sign the suspicion statement against the activist Sergey Sternenko and signing a suspicion against Olena Lukash, former Minister of Justice during the President Viktor Yanukovych times). Shariy actively opposed the land privatization program, which was implemented at the request of the IMF, as well as against the issuance of the next tranche of the IMF, which was signed on conditions unfavorable for Ukraine. Blogger began to criticize the authorities for their unwillingness to fulfill their election promises regarding the prosecution and initiation of criminal cases against representatives of the old government, in particular former President Petro Poroshenko, as well as activists, who, due to their special status (including work for the Security Service of Ukraine) avoided punishment for the crimes committed in part or in full. The video blogger called Vladimir Zelensky a ‚Äúkiller‚Äù and a man ‚Äúwith blood on his hands‚Äù, accused him of using death squads, dictatorial habits and the use of security forces and Security Service of Ukraine officers against his party. After the ‚Äúbrotherhood‚Äú of Sternenko attacked journalists of ‚ÄúShariy.net‚Äú on June 11‚Äî 12, Shariy called his supporters to a rally near the President's office.office . On 15 June, during the peaceful rally, the demonstrators demanded Zelensky's reaction to the current situation.  Reception  Lawsuits about Shariy\`s \\"anti-Ukrainism\\" and\\"pro-Russian\\" position Ukrainian media and politicians routinely describe Shariy as a pro-Russian or anti-Ukrainian propagandist; see e.g., the Ukrainian News Agency–°–ë–£ –∑–∞–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞–ª–∞ –≤ –ö–∏–µ–≤–µ –ø–æ–º–æ—â–Ω–∏—Ü—É –ê–Ω–∞—Ç–æ–ª–∏—è –®–∞—Ä–∏—è, Ukrainian News Agency, 5 September 2017 and others. Deputy from the \\"Servant of the People\\" and former External Advisor to the President of Ukraine Geo Leros published a document about topic lists issued by the Office of the President for the Ukrainian media, on how they must comment on different events. The document contained instructions on headlines and how to comment on various situations, including how the Ukrainian media should cover Anatoliy Shariy - what statements are worth talking about in relation to him, as well as about the protest action \\"The Mute President is not my President\\" (in Russian it is a pun: \\"Nemoy president - ne moy president\\"). Immediately after that, the Ukrainian media began to regularly sign Shariy with the thesis - pro-Russian, only confirming that the deputy from the Servants of the people put up the real topic list of the Office of the President. On August 28 the car of Geo Leros - was set on fire In February 2017 Shariy demanded through the court to refute the information published by the Internet publication \\", which, defames his honor, dignity and business reputation because of the article of journalist Bohdan Lohvynenko, in which Shariy was called \\"the bullhorn of the Russian world\\" and \\"a scandalous Ukrainian pseudo refugee\\" . In court, representatives of the defendants said that the definition of \\"Russian world\\" in itself does not carry a negative connotation, and therefore Shariy should not resent the expression \\"bullhorn of the Russian world\\". The objection was stated: > \\"There are many definitions, views, concepts, interpretations of history and > conceptual principles of the idea of \\"the Russian world\\" <...> the > definition given by playwright Nikolai Ostrovsky that \\"the Russian world is > a human community of Orthodox Christians living in the unity of faith, > ritualism and customs\\" is indicative.

Another court case was considered after journalist Vitaliy Portnikov characterized Shariy as a \\"Kremlin project\\" and \\"one used by its Russian owners\\". And Anatoli Shariy filed a lawsuit to refute these words. As a result, it turned out that Portnikov meant only his assumptions, but not the facts.–°–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∞ –®–∞—Ä—ñ—è: —è–∫ –í–µ—Ä—Ö–æ–≤–Ω–∏–π –°—É–¥ –¥–æ–∑–≤–æ–ª–∏–≤ –Ω–∞–∑–∏–≤–∞—Ç–∏ –±–ª–æ–≥–µ—Ä–∞ ‚Äú–∫—Ä–µ–º–ª—ñ–≤—Å—å–∫–∏–º –ø—Ä–æ–µ–∫—Ç–æ–º‚Äù (–∫–æ—Ä–∏—Å–Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–∏–∫–∞ –≤ –¥–∏—Ñ–∞–º–∞—Ü—ñ–π–Ω–∏—Ö —Å–ø–æ—Ä–∞—Ö).

In the same month, Shariy appealed to him and the presidential administration with a lawsuit demanding that the information be recognized as unreliable and humiliating to his honor, dignity and business reputation In May 2020 Pechersky District Court of Kyiv declared that it had not seen evidence that Shariy works for Russia, is a Russian journalist or works for any person who is a resident of the Russian Federation and has found such information unreliable. As a result, the Court ordered Poroshenko to place an announcement about the denial of false information in the nearest issue of the Uryadovy Kuryer newspaper. In the announcement, Poroshenko must declare that he distributed false information about Shariy during his working trip to Rivne region.

Awards and recognition In 2009, Shariy won the Yousmi Web-Journalism Award for \\"Best Story (Non-Professional)\\"..

In the same month he was number 3 of the top most popular Ukrainian political bloggers on Facebook according to the rating of Espreso TV. Journalist Vladimir Posner commented on Shariy's work, saying that Shariy was one of those who had the right to be called a journalist, because, unlike many others, Shariy is calling a spade a spade. Quote: \\"He allowed himself (and, as I understand it, continues to allow itself) to write and speak the truth about Ukraine. He once ended up making a run of it and now is forced to hide from the authorities of this extremely democratic country.\\" In 2019 Shariy was 34th in the list of Top 100 most influential people and phenomena in Ukraine according to the newspaper . The company Brand Analytics regularly publishes its ratings of Russophone YouTube-bloggers. In its ratings February 2019, in terms of viewer engagement rate (defined by the company as the sum of likes and comments), Shariy's vlog held the 1st place, collecting about 3 million likes and 430,000 comments. In terms of audience, with 1.8 million subscribers he was on the 38th place. The company noticed that political topics usually attracts a small fraction of YouTube viewers. In its June 2020 ranking - Top 20 Russian-speaking YouTube bloggers in terms of involvement, Anatoly Shariy was the 3rd with 4.4 million people involved.

Shariy entered the top 20 and took the 10th place.  Controversies  Shariy's attitude towards homosexuality  Anatoly Shariy belonged to the Organizing Committee of the movement \\"Love Against Homosexuality\\". In that position Shariy declared: ‚ÄúThe danger is that sometimes skinheads want to join the movement, [our] movement has nothing to do with that‚Ä¶ They [homosexual people] should sit and be happy that they are not getting killed. (‚Ä¶) From their side should be respect; on my part there is nothing to respect them for, [they are] sick people.‚Äù According to him the ultimate goal of Love Against Homosexuality is the following: ‚Äú[When] homosexual people stay in their apartments and won‚Äôt come out to streets, to mass media and won‚Äôt propagate their life style,‚Äù ‚Äúwe demand criminal liability for propaganda of homosexualism.‚Äù, Heinrich B√∂ll Foundation. On October 8, 2008 Shariy represented the movement \\"Love Against Homosexuality\\" on a TV show of the TV channel Inter. In the article \\"Blue Rust. Dictatorship of Sodomites\\" Shariy wrote: ‚ÄúIn Iran, after the Islamic revolution of 1979 over 4000 of lesbians and homosexuals have been sentenced to death. The clerical regime has also executed many women for adulterate sex. (‚Ä¶) I suppose the situation with prostitution, pedophilia, and rape in Iran is hundreds of times better than in our extremely cultured and civilized country.‚ÄùAnatoly Shariy, \\"–ì–æ–ª—É–±–∞—è —Ä–∂–∞–≤—á–∏–Ω–∞. –î–∏–∫—Ç–∞—Ç—É—Ä–∞ —Å–æ–¥–æ–º–∏—Ç–æ–≤\\" [\\"Blue Rust.

It particular, in July 2017 during a live broadcast of the show \\"My Truth\\" on the \\"Moscow Talking\\" radio channel, Feygin stated \\"He (Anatoly Shariy) is under investigation for pedophilia\\". Shariy sued him for defamation, and eventually, after Feygin's appeal, won the case. On 24 April 2018 the Moscow Chamber of Lawyers stripped Mark Feygin of his attorney status. He has been allowed to reinstate it after a period of one year by passing a bar exam or by successfully appealing the Chamber's decision. The ruling was based on Feygin's \\"inappropriate statements\\" (foul language) made towards Anatoly Shariy's lawyer Stalina Gurevich and Shariy himself . The court agreed with the plaintiff that Mark Feygin used foul language via his Twitter account to address a lawyer colleague and her client. See Mark Feygin#Anatoly Shariy lawsuit for more details. Registration of Shariy as parliamentary election candidate While Shariy's political party Party of Shariy was registered to take part in the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election, according to the Ukrainian law, Shariy himself could take part in the elections, because the 5 years leading up to the election he did not live in Ukraine.\\"–ú–ò–ù–Æ–°–¢ –ó–ê–†–ï–ì–ò–°–¢–†–ò–†–û–í–ê–õ \\"–ü–ê–†–¢–ò–Æ –®–ê–†–ò–Ø\\", NewsOne, June 6, 2019 Nevertheless, on 2 July 2019, the Central Election Commission (CEC) registered Shariy's candidate running for parliament according to a June 30 decision of the Supreme Court.\\"CEC registers Shariy, Yevtukhov as candidates running for parliament\\", Kyiv Post, July 2, 2019 On the next day, 3 July 2019, this decision was reverted. In an interview to the Ukrainian TV channel Shariy explained his actions in the event. When his registration was rejected for the first time due to the 5-year residency criterion, he contested the decision on the grounds that there was no legal evidence of his absence, because the Ukrainian border guard had no data about his border crossing. Accepting this argument, the Supreme Court instructed the CEC to accept the registration. However the next day CEC was ordered to revert this decision based on an additional evidence which in Shariy's opinion has no legal standing. He presented this controversy as a test for the absence of the rule of law in Ukraine, comparing it with the United States, where a case may be thrown out of the court on formal grounds (e.g., failure to read the Miranda warning to a detained suspect).–®–∞—Ä—ñ–π: –Ü–Ω–¥—É–ª—å–≥–µ–Ω—Ü—ñ—è –¥–ª—è –∫–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥–∏ –ó–µ–ª–µ–Ω—Å—å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Å–∫–∞—Å–æ–≤—É—î—Ç—å—Å—è ‚Äì —Ü–µ —Ñ–∞–∫—Ç\\" –ù–ê–®, July 4, 2019 Scandalous remarks in the media In 2014 published a video in which he made some controversial statements about some inhabitants of Western Ukraine: Shariy later apologized for the video and said that he was talking only about certain individuals.

Early life and education  Gutstein was born to Rabbi Morris Gutstein and Golda Gutstein in Newport, Rhode Island. Gutstein moved with his parents and brother, Naftali Gutstein, to Chicago in 1943. He received his A.B. with honors from the University of Chicago in 1953 and his Juris Doctor (J.D.) in 1956. From 1955-56, Gutstein was associate editor of the University of Chicago Law Review. While at law school, he took night classes at the Hebrew Theological College, and on July 31, 1956, Gutstein was ordained as a Rabbi by an Orthodox Judaism Beit Din in New York City consisting of Rabbi Nathan Dublinsky, Rabbi Leifa Wiesblum, and Rabbi Eliyahu Huberland. On September 3, 1961, Gutstein married Carol G. Feinhandler, who changed her name to Carol F. Gutstein.  Career and city council service  Though Gutstein has officiated life cycle events as a Rabbi, he never intended to pursue a career in theology. Gutstein started his legal career as an associate for Schratsky, Gould, and Ratner from 1956 through 1961. Showing a desire to be independent that would mark his career in and out of politics, Gutstein left the firm and for the next 30 years was either a partner or principal in his own firm. Always interested in politics, and encouraged by his politically active friend, Seymour Simon, Gutstein ran for and won a seat as Alderman of the City Council in 1975, representing the 40th ward of Chicago. At the time, the 40th Ward encompassed disparate ethnic neighborhoods on Chicago's northwest side, bordered by Peterson to the north, Kedzie to the west, and reaching as far as Irving Park to the south and Clark to the east. Though Gutstein did not emphasize his stature as Rabbi in his campaign, Mayor Richard J. Daley and the Cook County Democratic Party (\\"Democratic Party\\" or \\"the Party\\") supported his candidacy as the ward had been predominantly Jewish. In winning a seat on the Chicago City Council, Gutstein became the first ordained Rabbi to serve as Alderman. Gutstein was determined to make local government accessible to the citizens of his ward. Gutstein held regular walk-in office hours as well as monthly town meetings and zoning sessions in a various areas of the Ward. Through these meetings Gutstein achieved his goal of hearing first-hand the constituent concerns that ranged from potholes to crime. Gutstein also quickly established himself as an incorruptible Alderman, refusing to meet anyone without a third party present. Gutstein sponsored the first residential permit parking ordinance and maneuvered successfully to bring out of committee a previously stalled ordinance curtailing towing abuse so the law could be immediately considered and passed by the Council. As he championed legislation touching on religious issues, such as Sunday burial and a city Eruv, Gutstein also solicited input from Chicago rabbinical leaders. Gutstein lost the 1979 campaign in a close race owing largely to his loss of Dwmocratic Party support. Gutstein would return to the City Council for one night on December 1, 1987, following the death of Chicago Mayor Harold Washington on November 25, 1987. In recognition of his stature as a Rabbi, Gutstein was invited to give the opening prayer invocation of the contentious special City Council election of Eugene Sawyer as the City's 53rd mayor of Chicago. He cited the words of the Jewish Hebrew prayer, Sim Shalom, translated as \\"Grant Peace.\\" Gutstein resumed his legal practice full-time after his term ended as Alderman. In 1983, Gutstein established himself as a leading practitioner of Illinois Real Estate Law after writing a two volume treatise for Lawyers Cooperative Publishing. Gutstein would continue to build on his comprehensive practical legal guide and subsequently publish two new related publications. The current three volume work, first published in 2000 as part of the Illinois Practice Series, remains a popular resource for attorneys. In 1992, Gutstein merged his legal practice into Tenney and Bentley, LLC, where he now continues his real estate and business transaction practice. In addition to his practice and publications, he lectures extensively on real estate. Gutstein was a lecturer in business law at the Booth School of Business of the University of Chicago and an adjunct professor in real estate at John Marshall Law School (Chicago). He became a Business mediator in 2012. He is a member of the Illinois Bar and the Federal District Court Trial Bar for the Northern District of Illinois and is admitted to practice before the U. S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit and the United States Supreme Court.  Personal life  Gutstein was married to Carol F. Gutstein until her death on July 12, 2014, a loving marriage of over 50 years. Gutstein has four sons Jon, David, Daniel, and Josh, and 10 grandchildren Ethan, Emma, Naomi, Jacob, Ben, Yohan, Caleb, Eyal, Theodore, and Isaiah.

Nagodetov proces. Enciklopedija Slovenije, vol. 7, p. 270. Ljubljana: Mladinska knjiga. The trial was carried out by the Slovene authorities under the leadership of the Communist Party of Slovenia against non-communist politicians that wished to participate in politics in Slovenia after 1945. In May 1947 the Slovenian secret police (UDBA) arrested 32 highly educated intellectuals. These included some former members of the Communist Party of Slovenia, but the majority were liberal democrats that were inclined toward western-style parliamentary democracy. Those arrested included ƒårtomir Nagode, Ljubo Sirc, Leon Kavƒçnik, Boris Furlan, Zoran Hribar, Angela Vode, Metod Kumelj, Pavla Hoƒçevar, Svatopluk Zupan, Bogdan Stare, Metod Pirc, Vid Lajovic, Franjo Sirc, and Elizabeta Hribar, and during the trial Franc Snoj was added to the group. They were interrogated and tortured for two months in Ljubljana's prisons. The Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Slovenia used the Slovene media to characterize those arrested as \\"a handful of spies, class enemies, foreign paid agents, who have no political program and whose work, with no political value at all, is to damage the people's authority.\\" The trial against the accused began on July 29, and the proceedings were broadcast to the public via special loudspeakers on the streets.

Early career A graduate of York University, Pite began his professional career in California in 1980 where he worked as a freelance drummer. In 1981 he returned to London and freelanced in jazz, rock and country music. He joined the Carey Duncan Band in the summer of 1981 and spent two years touring Europe and the US with this Country Rock combo. He was concurrently working with a 1920s jazz band called The Rio Trio which, in 1982, became the resident band on BBC Radio 4's weekly show, And So To Ned, hosted by Ned Sherrin. In 1983 he joined The Ross Mitchell Band ‚Äì the last band to be resident at the London dance venue, the Hammersmith Palais. The band played for international ballroom dancing championships and released several albums of \\"strict tempo\\" music. In 1986 he took over the management of The Rio Trio, a position he held for 10 years. After two tours of the US in 1995 and 1996 the band split up. Jazz Repertory Company Pite is the founder, producer and musical director of The Jazz Repertory Company ‚Äì the only organisation in the UK dedicated solely to producing concerts highlighting the significant musicians, styles and events in jazz history. Diligently researched and using specialist musicians, the productions aim to recreate jazz history as authentically as possible either in overviews such as the popular 100 Years of Jazz in 99 minutes or specific events such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington appearing for the first time in London in 1932 and 1933 or Benny Goodman‚Äôs Famous 1938 Carnegie Hall Jazz Concert. The Jazz Repertory Company concerts take place at London‚Äôs Cadogan Hall and the first concert staged there was in 2008. This concert recreated the music Artie Shaw recorded with big band and strings in the years 1937 to 1939 and the music had never been presented live in the UK up until this time. Much of the music presented by the Jazz Repertory Company had been popular in its day but was now in danger of sinking into obscurity. An example of this was the music of Raymond Scott which formed part of the programme of 2009‚Äôs Chamber Jazz. Scott‚Äôs Quintette racked up numerous big-selling discs and he later ended up selling his back catalogue to Warner Brothers who took the music and utilised it in many of their Looney Tunes cartoons. Scott‚Äôs Powerhouse was used nine times by Warner Brothers and recently was recycled in an episode of The Simpsons. Another example of a, now largely forgotten, mass entertainment phenomenon being recently revived by the JRC is the music of Paul Whiteman ‚Äì the leading bandleader of 1920s America. A million selling artist who is now largely remembered for commissioning George Gershwin to write Rhapsody In Blue in 1924 and employing one of the first great names in jazz history ‚Äì Bix Beiderbecke. Other jazz musicians and stars of popular music celebrated in Jazz Repertory Concerts range from The Andrews Sisters and Glenn Miller to Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker and from Sidney Bechet and Fats Waller through to Weather Report and Herbie Hancock.

It specialises in jazz, blues, soul and funk music for all kinds of events and venues including festivals and theatres, corporate and private clients, weddings, parties, product and marketing launches and for TV, film and radio. Party Jazz is responsible for launching and nurturing such bands as The Rio Trio, Royal Hen, Soul Shadows and The Hush Puppies and for supporting talent such as Eric Ranzoni, Reuben Richards, Liz Fletcher and Cousin Alice, . Boisdale Jazz Clubs In 1999 Pite became Director of Music for Boisdale PLC, booking live entertainment for The Boisdale Jazz and Cigar Club in Belgravia London.

As director of Music he has booked acts such as Acker Bilk, Kenny Ball, Paul Jones, Georgie Fame, Hot Chocolate, Chucho Valdez, Mud Morganfield, Ray Gelato, Midge Ure, The Humphrey Lyttelton Band, Chris Barber, Liane Carroll, Buddy Whittington and The Foundations. He has also been a dedicated supporter of new and emerging talent such as Philip Achille, Vimala Rowe, Orli Nyles, Heather Simmons and Lee Gold as well as helping Manchester's Jeremy Sassoon establish himself in London. Professional musician and bandleader Since the age of 18 Pite has worked as a professional drummer and he is also proficient on double bass, tuba/sousaphone and assorted percussion instruments. At the start of his career Pite specialised in Vintage and Classic Jazz from the 1920s to the 1950s. He has specialised in this genre ever since and performed regularly with internationally acclaimed artists such as Keith Nichols and The Blue Devils, The Pasadena Roof Orchestra and for 10 years he performed with The Rio Trio (1986-1996). Pite frequently performs at Boisdale Belgravia and Canary Wharf on drums and bass, as well as acting as bandleader and sideman in numerous jazz bands (mainly vintage and mainstream). His personal musical projects include Soul Shadows (playing the music of Jazz Funk pioneers The Crusaders), The Hush Puppies - a band dedicated to playing soul funk and pop with minimal amplification and London Omnibus - a trio performing jazz and popular music of the 1920s and 30s alongside comedy and vaudeville routines. In the media Pite has often been featured in the media both as a guest expert and an artist including the Claire Teal show on BBC Radio 2, as well as his own radio show on 40s UK Radio and local radio stations. He was guest expert on five one hour long episodes of Jazz Library for BBC Radio 3. His broadcast work includes adverts for Lexus (with Kylie Minogue) and McDonald's for the 2014 World Cup campaign. Movies include Harry Potter, Me and Orson Welles and I Capture The Castle. He has been interviewed by many print and online magazines including Blues Matters, and London Jazz News,. His concerts have been lauded in many media sources including The Daily Telegraph, and The Evening Standard.

It is on the Nant Ceibwr (Ceibwr Stream) that flows through Moylegrove and into Ceibwr Bay. Part of the parish lies within the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park. Name Monington‚Äôs Welsh name translates into English as the \\"church of eight men\\", reflecting the fact that there were eight freeholders in the parish when it was founded. The origin of the English name is obscure. Description Monington is a rural parish in the community of Nevern, close to the source of Nant Ceibwr, the stream that flows through Moylegrove and into Ceibwr Bay. The parish is in the Diocese of St David's and the parish church is dedicated to St Nicholas. The present church, built in 1860, is a Grade II listed building, built in 1860 in high- Victorian Gothic style. There are 11 other listed buildings or structures in the parish, including several at Pantsaeson in the north of the parish. History Monington mill Dyfed Archaeological Trust records suggest that a battle took place at Pantsaeson in the early medieval period. The earliest- known written records of Monington are from the 13th century when knight's fees were contributing to the manor of Maenclochog.

To protect this place, several forts were built around the cove, Fort Plaisance in 1662, Fort Royal in 1687, and Fort Saint Louis in 1690. Fort Plaisance was built inside the harbor in order to protect the small port city of Plaisance from an attack enemy. During its construction, the Fort Plaisance had earthen ramparts reinforced by wooden stakes. In the beginning it had four guns. Its armament was gradually increased and in 1667, the fort had 32 guns. In 1713, the Treaty of Utrecht forced the French to abandon their settlements in Newfoundland. 'Plaisance' become 'Placentia'.

Founded in 2005 by the United Grand Lodge of England, it is the only Regular Masonic jurisdiction in North Macedonia. English Masonry in North Macedonia From 1996 onwards a number of Macedonian citizens were initiated into Freemasonry in London, with a view to establishing a regular Masonic lodge in the Macedonian capital, Skopje. They were active members of their London lodges, but were also authorised to hold a Lodge of Instruction in Skopje. By the year 2000 the group numbered 23 individuals, several of whom were Past Masters, and arrangements were made for the consecration ceremony in Macedonia. Skopje Lodge was consecrated on 2 October 2000 by a team of officers from the United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE), assisted by the Grand Lodge of Austria. Skopje Lodge was assigned the warrant number 9721 on the UGLE register of lodges. Having established regular Freemasonry, the UGLE representatives returned to consecrate two further lodges, namely Unity Lodge No 9749 consecrated on 8 February 2002, and White Dawns Lodge No 9765 consecrated on 20 June 2003. This brought the number of lodges to three, the internationally recognised minimum number of lodges which may constitute an independent national Grand Lodge (see \\"Basic Principles for Grand Lodge Recognition\\", published 4 September 1929 by the home Grand Lodges). Grand Lodge consecration On Friday 30 September 2005 the Grand Lodge of Macedonia (GLM) was consecrated by the United Grand Lodge of England, with Spencer Compton, 7th Marquess of Northampton, Pro Grand Master, presiding as the consecrating officer. Consecrations of foreign Grand Lodges by the United Grand Lodge of England are relatively unusual. Given the position of UGLE, the original Grand Lodge within world Freemasonry, official recognition of the new Macedonian Grand Lodge followed swiftly. Today the Grand Lodge of Macedonia is recognised by most of the world's regular Grand Lodges. Facilities The Grand Lodge building in Skopje. In its earliest days the GLM rented accommodation in the Cafe Jurist, Skopje. Later it was able to establish a permanent temple and offices at premises in Bitpazarska, although these were still rented. In 2009 the Grand Lodge moved to premises on Prashka Street, where more space was available, but continued expanding its building fund towards the aim of its own permanent headquarters. An opportunity arose with the development of Skopje's Zebra Centre, a modern development incorporating a hotel, shopping precinct, offices, restaurants, and a multi-storey car park. Through careful negotiation and extensive fund-raising it became possible to construct an entire additional wing of the Zebra Centre as a Grand Lodge building, to be owned outright by the GLM. This building, which covers four storeys, includes a large masonic temple, administrative offices and board rooms, changing rooms, a masonic museum, a dining room and kitchens, and a masonic club open daily to members. The facility opened in 2012. A small part of the building is currently let commercially; in due course, as the need arises, it is planned to develop this part of the building into a second masonic temple, so that more than one lodge may meet simultaneously. Constituent lodges The three lodges consecrated as part of the UGLE became the initial three lodges of the Grand Lodge of Macedonia. Their English warrant numbers have been retained in their names, whilst new Macedonian warrant numbers have been issued. Thus they have become: Skopje Lodge 9721, No 1; Unity Lodge 9749, No 2; and White Dawns Lodge 9765, No 3. Subsequently, new lodges numbered 4, 5, and 6 have been consecrated by the GLM. Lodge 1 works its ritual in the English language; all other Macedonian lodges work in Macedonian. Royal Arch Macedonian Freemasonry follows the British and Commonwealth model, with \\"pure ancient Masonry\\" acknowledged to consist of the three degrees worked in lodges, plus the Holy Royal Arch degree, practiced in associated chapters. Although Craft Freemasonry has been independent since 2005, Royal Arch Freemasonry in Macedonia is still for the time being controlled from London. Rival body A rival body named the Regular Grand Lodge of Macedonia was also established in Skopje, in 2010. Whilst it has some features of masonic regularity, it lacks international recognition, and is considered irregular and clandestine by the home Grand Lodges.

It opened on October 13, 1938 and was destroyed by fire on January 13, 2015. The theatre was designed by William G. Blakey and built by I.F.Shacker of Hanna. It was managed by Bill Wilson, the son of a Famous Players theatre manager. It was considered luxurious for its time as it had air conditioning, spring seating, and extra legroom. In 1941, the theatre was leased to Odeon Theatres of Canada. After Odeon's lease ran out, the cinema was operated as a part of Inner City Cinemas along with the Avenue Theatre and Varscona Theatre. Inner City Cinemas ran a calendar program that ran movies for three days first at one, then the next, then the next cinema. Famous Players leased all 3 theatres from Inner City, which ended their unique venture. When Famous gave up the lease, the Roxy became The $2 Roxy, operating as a discount theatre with all shows $2, operated by Magic Lantern Theatres, which also had their offices in the retail space in the front of the building. In 1989, the building was taken over by the Theatre Network and converted to a live-theatre venue. A fire at the theatre was called in to the Edmonton Fire Department just before 4am on January 13, 2015. Firefighters were unable to control the blaze and the building was destroyed. As of June 2015, the cause of the fire remains unknown. The Theatre Network had planned to open a new show the night of the fire and had to find alternate venues for its shows. The Theatre Network plans to rebuild the theatre.

The film stars Joseph Fiennes, Tom Felton, Peter Firth, and Cliff Curtis, and details a Roman soldier's search for Yeshua's body following his resurrection. Columbia Pictures released the film to theaters in the United States on February 19, 2016. It received mixed reviews and grossed $46 million worldwide.  Plot  After crushing a Zealot revolt led by Barabbas, Clavius, a Roman Tribune, is sent by Pontius Pilate to expedite a crucifixion already in progress. Three days later he is appointed to investigate the rumors of a risen Jewish Messiah. Pilate orders him to locate the missing body of Yeshua, one of the crucified men. In doing so, Pilate seeks to quell an imminent uprising in Jerusalem before the Emperor arrives. Failing to secure Yeshua's body, Clavius, with the support of his loyal aide Lucius, attempts to locate and question the disciples of Yeshua and those involved in his crucifixion and burial for clues to his disappearance. Numerous leads are dug up, and their accounts soon become increasingly miraculous and difficult to believe. Some of the followers, such as Mary Magdalene and a man named Bartholomew, seemingly speak only in riddles and refuse to betray any others. Clavius' intense investigation begins to disturb both Romans and Hebrews alike, and Pilate, under pressure from many sides and fearful of Caesar's wrath, becomes increasingly distant and unsupportive. Running out of new leads, Clavius revisits a disgraced Roman soldier, assigned to guard Yeshua's cave tomb, now a drunkard, and vehemently shakes the drunken man out of a lie that he had previously stuck to. The soldier recounts a fantastic story that, on the morning Yeshua disappeared, a blinding flash had appeared, during which the stone and ropes sealing the tomb disintegrated, and a figure appeared, accompanied by a booming voice that sent him and a fellow soldier fleeing in fear. Clavius does not believe him. During a raid through a Jewish enclave, Clavius unexpectedly discovers a seemingly resurrected Yeshua with his apostles in a solitary abode. Stunned, he calls off the search, barring Lucius and his men from finding Yeshua and the apostles. That night, another Roman raid, led by Lucius and Pilate, attacks the building that Clavius had forbidden them from entering, and finds it empty, save a note from Clavius, who has decided to continue the investigation on his own. Having abandoned Roman polytheism and the god Mars, Clavius, at first distrustful of the group, soon joins Yeshua and his followers on a journey to determine the validity of his mortal rejuvenation, during which he talks to and befriends both Yeshua and the apostle Peter. Pilate deduces that Clavius has apparently betrayed him, and dispatches a contingent of Roman troops, led by a promoted Lucius, to pursue him and Yeshua. Clavius assists the disciples in evading the Roman search party, and, when caught personally by Lucius, Clavius disarms him, then convinces him to let them pass quietly. Consequently, Clavius witnesses Yeshua's miraculous healing of a leper, and then the ascension of Yeshua into Heaven; after which the Apostles split up to resume their journeys, and Clavius bids farewell to Peter. Later, communicating his travels to a stranger in a remote dwelling, Clavius acknowledges the strangeness of the tale and its veracity, feeling he will never be the same.

The association Le Patriarche developed a different approach to withdrawal, based on a system free from drugs and substitutes. It also implied a redefinition of social ties. The newcomers were under the supervision of their peers, who had experienced the same problem. The association's motto was \\"help, to be helped\\". In the eighties, many centers were opened in Europe and the Americas. In the early nineties, it had more than 5,000 residents in 210 centers, located in 17 countries. 1980s When the AIDS pandemic broke out, the association Le Patriarche was able to provide some care to the HIV-positive, by opening dedicated centres. However, it was unable to evolve and follow the new trends in consumption and treatments, being heavily criticised, mainly for the lack of qualified staff and having a structure based on free workforce. In 1985, the Swiss section of the association Le Patriarche separated and named a new president; however, the Swiss government seized the centres in its territory and forbid Lucien Engelmajer from entering the country. 1990s In 1995, the association Le Patriarche was signalled by a French governmental report as a sect.Le Patriarche est cit√© par une commission de l'Assembl√©e Nationale dans le rapport de 1995 sur les sectes The association's charismatic leader and founder was accused and trialed on charges of embezzlement and violence against residents. In 1998, he was forced to quit by the administration. In the same year, the association was restructured and all references to its past were erased. That same year, pressured by judicial outcomes, le Patriarche rebranded and adopted \\"the corporate name, Dianova, in order to emphasize its renewal\\", attempting to separate from its founder. 2000s and 2010s On January 9, 2007, a Toulouse court condemned Lucien Engelmajer, founder of the association ¬´Le Patriarche¬ª, for abuse of ignorance or frailty, practice of covert labour, breach of trust, embezzlement, forgery, money laundering, to a sentence of 5 years imprisonment and a fine of 375.000 euros.MIVILUDES - Mission interminist√©rielle de vigilance et de lutte contre les d√©rives sectaires, \\"Rapport au Premier ministre\\", p.32 Under several arrest warrants, Lucien Engelmajer escaped to Belize, where he came to die in 2007 The association continues its activities under the name Dianova InternationalEric Cl√©ment, LaPresse.ca - Dianova: un pass√© lourd √† porter pour l'ancienne secte and was even granted special consultative status by the United Nations Economic and Social Council in 2007.

Writing in The Oxford Mail in June 2013, Katherine McAlister described Melody as 'a real-life Louis Theroux who gets her hands dirty....Earlier this year you could find Victoria spray-tanned and manicured in her attempt to become Mrs Glamour UK, as well as waking at 5am to begin her dog Major Tom's arduous training schedule in their bid to win Crufts, all of which culminates in her...show Major Tom.'Katherine MacAlister, 'Major Project', The Oxford Mail 20 June 2013 Melody has presented her work nationally and internationally at venues including Soho Theatre, Oxford Playhouse, The Lowry, Bristol Old Vic, Battersea Arts Centre, Summerhall (Edinburgh Festival Fringe), Push Festival (Canada), Aarhus Festival (Denmark), Bucharest International Theatre Festival (Romania), All For One Theatre Festival, New York, and Virginia Arts Festival (USA), and Brisbane Festival (Australia). Early exhibitions Melody has a BA degree in Fine Art from the University of Northumbria in Newcastle and a Postgraduate Diploma in Fine Art from Chelsea College of Art.'Ventilation', Millais Gallery catalogue, Southampton Solent University, 2005 She first exhibited her work in Southampton, in two solo shows in which she combined film with live performance: All Fur Coat and No Knickers (a space, 2004) and Ventilation (Millais Gallery, 2005). The Millais Gallery catalogue described the theme of her work as 'the ways in which negative emotions are displayed and vented in contemporary society.' In the shows, she filmed herself and members of the public venting their angers and frustrations in their own individual ways. Melody also created a series of alter-egos to express different emotions. As 'Pissed-Off Pumpkin', she dressed as a pumpkin who abused the audience/viewer through a shiny megaphone. 'Bemused Bear', with Melody dressed in a bear costume, was an expression of gloom and loneliness. For her most exasperated character,'Bastard Bee', she dressed as a childlike representation of a bee, wielding a chainsaw which she used to attack a wooden chair. Melody also took her alter-egos out into the real world. In 2004, Bastard Bee 'occupied a cubicle in ‚ÄòThe Blue X‚Äô a lap dance club in the centre of Leicester where he gave free one-to one-lap dances with a difference to a mainly male unsuspecting audience.' Demographics of a Pigeon Fancier Melody's first 'ethnographic' work was her 2009 exhibition, Demographics of a Pigeon Fancier (Crab Fair, West Cumbria; The Basement, Brighton). This was the result of months spent living with British pigeon fanciers during the racing season. In her research, she gathered data using film, interviews, photography and notes. Melody was interested in the homes fanciers lived in, how much they weighed, and how their hobby affected relationships with family and friends. She met the pigeons and collected fanciers' anecdotes, stories and poems.Melody's description of the exhibition on her website The show also became a dialogue about regional differences between people living in Egremont, Cumbria, and Brighton. Cumbrians were asked, 'Northerners what do you think about the South?' and Brightonians were asked, 'Southerners, what do you think about the North?' The responses were then delivered to Cumbria and Brighton by homing pigeons. Northern Soul The North was also the theme of Melody's next project, an investigation of Northern Soul dancing, in which she visited soul clubs, and learned how to dance in strangers' living rooms. Melody then created her first theatre show, Northern Soul (2012), working with the director Ursula Martinez and the choreographer, Janine Fletcher of The Two Wrongies. The show brought together material from the pigeon and soul projects, with stories from Melody's own childhood in Cheshire. Reviewing the piece in Total Theatre, Thomas Bacon wrote, 'Victoria Melody just wants to join in, and in Northern Soul she presents herself as a sharing artist....The premise of Northern Soul builds upon this sense of sharing as Melody leads us through the documentation of her endeavours to immerse herself in two distinct, yet marginal worlds: Pigeon Fancying and the cult of Northern Soul. Melody celebrates the social oddities of these cultural institutions with a respectful tenderness that resonates with her own peculiarities as she relates her project-work to personal experiences of growing up as an ostracised figure ‚Äì unpopular in schools and society, and sidelined to a certain extent at home.'Thomas Bacon, 'Victoria Melody: Northern Soul', Total Theatre, 5 November 2012 Major Tom Melody's second theatre show, which premiered in 2013, was an exploration of dog shows and beauty pageants. It was called Major Tom, after her pet basset hound, who appeared on stage with her ('The dog is remarkably placid and never lets his hangdog expression slip. As such he becomes the straight man to Ms Melody's oddball.'Juliet Hindell, review of Major Tom, Exeunt Magazine 2 May 2015) The piece tells the story of Melody's attempt to win the title of Mrs Galaxy UK, while also entering Major Tom for Crufts. Her own process involved intensive physical training and various makeovers, including hypnotherapy, gastric bands, hair extensions and a spray tan. 'The comparisons [to dog shows] are uncanny.' she told Alice Vincent of the Telegraph, ' The criteria is the same, the ridiculousness, the absurdity, it's all the same.'Alice Vincent, 'Pageants, dog shows and Major Tom', The Telegraph, 10 Mar 2014 Despite being aware of the absurdity of the competition, Melody said, 'I definitely fell for all the promises that people made me to become more beautiful and when I was the most conventionally beautiful I could be, I had the least self-esteem. But somewhere in the process I became a competitor, and I really wanted to win.' Major Tom was reviewed by Lyn Gardner in the Guardian: 'But what is the right look ‚Äì whether you are a dog or a human? Who decides? Having simultaneously embarked on a project to turn herself into a beauty queen, Melody sets out to explore these issues ‚Äì and presents her findings in this dramatised piece....Like Major Tom, she is prodded and primped; like her dog, she has to learn to walk the right way in the show-ring. Major Tom has his balls judged; Melody has her figure and smile assessed. It's a neat parallel, and one that Melody plays with a mixture of inconsequential charm and sly knowingness in a piece that is both startlingly bonkers and utterly ordinary at the same time.'Lyn Gardner, 'Major Tom - Review', The Guardian, 12 May 2013 Hair Peace Melody's 2015 theatre show, called Hair Peace, was directed by Paul Hodson with dramaturgical guidance from Rachel Chavkin of the New York TEAM theatre company. On the Warwick Arts Centre website, Melody explained how the work developed from the themes of Major Tom: 'During my reign as Mrs Brighton a hairdresser gave me real human hair extensions. This prompted me to ask where the hair had come from, the hairdresser didn‚Äôt know. Last year HM Revenue and Customs recorded more than ¬£38m worth of human hair entering the country. Right now obtaining that high maintenance preened and pruned and big haired 'The Only Way is Essex look' is big business in the UK. But then why is there little or no information about where and who the hair comes from and if it is ethical? I plan to trace the hair on my head back to the person who grew it and to start a cross-cultural conversation.''Hair Peace' Warwick Arts Centre website Hair Peace opened at the Pleasance as part of the 2015 Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Donald Hutera, reviewing the show in The Times, wrote that Melody 'must rank as one of the most charming independent performance-makers in Britain ‚Äî smart, warm, unpretentiously funny and informative, just like the piece itself....She interviews a forensic scientist, travels to India to go on a pilgrimage with a young woman keen to sell her own hair, and exposes the exploitative practices of rampant human hair traffic in Russia. Throughout her journey Melody observes rather than judges those she meets, sharing with us what she's gleaned. It's the human face of social consciousness, with gags. All of the above is accomplished through a combination of direct address, meaning that Melody just talks to us, and judiciously used video footage. The latter provides an unforced emotional climax as we watch, on neighbouring screens, Melody's cousin ‚Äî a big fan of hair extensions ‚Äî watching Melody's Indian buddy having her head shaved, which we also get to see. The gentle layering of images and feelings has a quiet but telling impact. On its own modest scale, Hair Peace might change how you think.'Donald Hutera, 'Hair Peace', The Times,15 August 2015 Ugly Chief In 2016, Melody began work on a new show, Ugly Chief, a literal translation of her name in its original Gaelic (Maoil√©idigh). Ugly Chief is a collaboration with her father, the antique dealer, Mike Melody, who regularly appears on daytime television programmes. The inspiration was Mike Melody's mistaken diagnosis with a terminal illness. She wrote, 'When we found out that dad was ok I asked him if he would collaborate with me on a new theatre show ‚Äì he said yes. We decided that the show would take the form of dad's funeral. In my signature ethnographic approach to creating work I am going to train to become a funeral director to demystify the British funeral system. An aim of the show is to destroy the taboo around talking about death.'Victoria Melody, 'Newsletter 2016 New Show, Hair Peace Tour and Me and Dad Sitting in Chairs.' Ugly Chief had its premiere at Battersea Arts Centre on 30 October 2017. In her Guardian review, Lyn Gardner described it as 'a ridiculously enjoyable show, not least because the tension is always apparent between Victoria's desire to exert control and Mike's natural talent for chaos. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to like this,‚Äù Victoria tells the audience when Dad wrests charge of the second half, creating his dream funeral in which he is buried in a beer barrel in a barbecue pit with the mourners wearing Blackpool FC's tangerine strip, and a band playing his trad jazz favourites. Of course we love it. Just as we love the rest of this generous, funny show...'Lyn Gardner, 'Ugly Chief review ‚Äì how to have fun at your own funeral', The Guardian, 3 November 2017 Professional Stranger In 2019, Melody announced that she had begun a new project, Professional Stranger, a work-in-progress about her attempts to become a stand-up comedian. 'Wearing technology that shows in real time what happens to the brain when you tell jokes, Victoria reveals what happened when she immersed herself in the world of British amateur stand-up comedy.'Description of the project on Melody's website While resident artist at Watershed's Pervasive Media Studio in Bristol, Melody collaborated with the neuroscientist, Silvana de Pirro, using an EEG mobile headset that reads the brain's electrical activity. 'It measures emotional states, such as stress, engagement, interest, excitement, focus and relaxation. It‚Äôs like a mind reader and you can train your brain, like a Jedi, you can actually fly a drone with your mind. Rather than showing data to audiences as a boring chart with waveforms we‚Äôve created an avatar. The avatar is projected onto a screen and is controlled by my brain through the EEG headset. People can tell how I‚Äôm really thinking. If I tell a joke and I look happy but inside I‚Äôm dying because nobody has found it funny, like a truth telling machine. Audiences always want to know what‚Äôs real and what‚Äôs made up, the person behind the persona. I‚Äôm working towards a show that will be combining all of these elements.'Description of the project in Melody's newsletter References External links * Victoria Melody's official website * Vimeo trailer for Northern Soul * Vimeo trailer for Major Tom * Victoria Melody, 'Help!

It is housed in the Faculty of Arts at the University of Bonn and was established with funding from the North Rhine-Westphalian Academy of Sciences, Humanities and the Arts.Project information on the website of the North Rhine-Westphalian Academy of Sciences, Humanities and the Arts. Accessed on March 31, 2015 The project has a projected run-time of fifteen years and is directed by Nikolai Grube from the Department of Anthropology of the Americas at the University of Bonn.Project information on the website of the Department of Anthropology of the Americas, University of Bonn. Accessed on March 31, 2015 The goal of the project is to conduct computer-based studies of all extant Maya hieroglyphic texts from an epigraphic and cultural-historical standpoint, and to produce and publish a database and a comprehensive dictionary of the Classic Mayan language.  Subject of the Project  The text database, as well as the dictionary that will be compiled by the conclusion of the project, will be assembled based on all known texts from the pre-Hispanic Maya culture. These texts were produced and used between approximately the third century B.C. through A.D. 1500, in a region that today includes parts of the countries of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras. The thousands of hieroglyphic inscriptions on monuments, ceramics, or daily objects that have survived into the present offer insight into the language's vocabulary and structure. The project's database and dictionary will digitally represent original spellings using the logo-syllabic Maya hieroglyphs, as well as their transcription and transliteration in the Roman alphabet. The data will be additionally annotated with various epigraphic analyses, translations, and further object-specific information.  Project Partners  TWKM will employ digital technologies in order to compile and make available the data and metadata, as well as to publish the project's research results. The project thereby methodologically positions itself in the field of the digital humanities. The project will be conducted in cooperation with the project partners (below), the research association for the eHumanities TextGrid, as well as the University and Regional Library of Bonn (ULB). The working environment that is currently under construction, in which the data and metadata will be compiled and annotated, will be realized in theTextGrid Laboratory, a software of the virtual research environment. A further component of this software, the TextGrid Repository, will make the data that are authorized for publication freely available online and ensure their long-term storage.TextGrid Tools and Services Accessed on April 27, 2015. The tools for data compilation and annotation attained from the modularly constructed and extended TextGrid lab thereby provide all the necessary materials for facilitating the research team's the typical epigraphic workflow. The workflow usually begins by documenting the texts and the objects on which they are preserved, and by compiling descriptive data. It then continues with the various levels of epigraphic and linguistic analysis, and concludes in the best case scenario with a translation of the analyzed inscription and a corresponding publication. In cooperation with the ULB, selected data will additionally be made available. The project's Virtual Inscription Archive will present online, in the Digital Collections of the ULB, hieroglyphic inscriptions selected from the published data in the repository, including an image of and brief information about the texts and the objects on which they are written, epigraphic analysis, and translation.  Project Goal  One of the project's goals is to produce a dictionary of Classic Mayan, in both digital and print form, towards the end of the project run-time. Additionally, a database with a corpus of inscriptions, including their translations and epigraphic analyses, will be made freely available online. The database furthermore will provide an ontology-like link of the contextual object data with the inscriptions and with each other, thereby allowing a cultural-historical arrangement of all contents within the periods of pre-Hispanic Maya culture. The contents of the database are additionally linked to citations of relevant literature. As a result, the database will also make freely available to both the scientific community and other interested parties a bibliography representing the research history and a base of knowledge concerning ancient Maya culture and script. In addition, the Classic Maya script, in its temporally defined stages of language development, will be gathered into and documented in a comprehensive language corpus with the aid of the information gathered by the project. In collaboration with all project participants, the corpus data can be used, together with the aid of various comparable analyses and also computational linguistic methods, such as inference-based methods, to confirm readings of some hieroglyphs that are currently only partially confirmed, and to eventually completely decipher the Classic Maya script.

A 10-minute segment on Sydney station ATN-7, it was a drama about a family, and was produced by the Christian Television Association. Cast included Harry Howlett (who also wrote it), his wife also played a role, as well as Rosemary Barker and Annette Andre. The series aired live, with the cast consisting mainly of amateurs drawn from church drama clubs. It is not known if any of the episodes were kinescoped (note: kinescope recording was an early method of recording live television, used in the days before video-tape was widely available). It was probably the first attempt at a dramatic TV series produced for Australian television, though not the first dramatic TV series produced in that country (overseas-financed children's series The Adventures of Long John Silver was the first in that regard, and pre-dated the introduction of television to Australia) Australian TV drama was relatively rare at the time. ATN next attempted drama with the series with Autumn Affair, a soap opera, and the well-received monthly anthology series Shell Presents (sharing production with GTV-9, which alternated in producing episodes). Other 1950s-era attempts at local television drama included twice-monthly one-off plays on ABC, and the short-lived GTV-produced hospital series Emergency. Background A condition of a commercial television station's licence was that it had to make available free pro-rate air time to the Christian religious dominations; ATN-7 had an allocated quarter hour on Sunday afternoon. The manager of ATN-7 in Sydney, Len Mauger, allowed Harry Howlett, a former actor and then executive for an association of Protestant churches, to use that quarter hour for a drama series. It was called The House on the Corner and was given the nickname The Brothel on the Bend. It was directed by David Cahill. According to Ailsa McPherson, who worked on the show as a script assistant, \\"it had a script with a social message and some highly dramatic scenes, with settings created by scavenging among the stock flats and properties available at ATN. She said the actors would come into Seven's studio on Sunday afternoon and there was a camera rehearsal before transmission.

Pierson was the Farm Director for WKY-TV and Radio for over twenty years as well as the owner of Pierson Seed Farms, Inc. Early life Born on a farm 3 miles north of Mangum, OK down in Greer County. Pierson started school when he was 4 years old, and was then held back a year so that he could be with his cousins. Pierson attended a little one-room country school and stayed in the Mangum school district until he left to attend Oklahoma A&M; in Stillwater, OK. In high school, Pierson was very involved in sports. He played left end as well and defensive halfback. He was also on the track team as a distance runner, which he considered his main sport. Pierson was also involved with 4-H in high school; his specialty was cotton. Pierson enrolled at Oklahoma A&M; (Oklahoma State University) in September 1929 with the intention of becoming an athletic coach. After a few weeks he switched over to agriculture. Pierson did not often return home for a visit because their main mode of travel was hitchhiking. It could take well over a day to get from Stillwater to Mangum. To continue his running career, Pierson made the Oklahoma State cross country team as well as the track team as a distance runner. He competed in varsity events and won the ‚ÄúLoving Cup,‚Äù or first place, in the Tulsa Run. Pierson was also involved with the crop judging team and the Aggie Society where he eventually became the vice-president. Pierson met his would-be-wife, Bernice Strom, when he and some other students elected her for ‚ÄúAggie Princess.‚Äù Bernice was honored with the title in 1933 and the two began to date soon after. They dated for three years and married in 1936. A year into their marriage, their first daughter LaNese was born. Six years later, their second daughter Patricia was born. Pierson was the first of his family to graduate from college in 1937. Career The first job Pierson had was as an assistant county agent for $135 a month. He worked with Uncle Tom Marks, the oldest county agent in Oklahoma. After working in this position for two years, Pierson became the county extension agent of Garvin County, Oklahoma and worked there for 11 years. During seven of those years, his teams won the state championship in crop judging and had several grand champion titles in the livestock exhibition. Pierson was offered the head of the Oklahoma Crop Improvement Association and served in that position for seven years. At the time, the main crop Pierson worked with was wheat, but he also worked with alfalfa, grain sorghums, and watermelons. Pierson and his department were responsible for the entire state of Oklahoma. In 1953, Pierson established Pierson Seed Company and through contract production became the nation's largest producer of certified okra seed. After his time in the commercial seed business, Pierson‚Äôs career took quite a different path. Broadcasting career After working as the director of the marketing division of the state board of agriculture, Pierson‚Äôs alma mater Oklahoma A & M contacted him with an offer to take over the farm broadcasting for WKY Radio and Television. In 1959, Pierson accepted the position with the Oklahoma Publishing Company owned station WKY. For every broadcast, Pierson closed the program with a rhyme. Every broadcast for over twenty years had a different poem that he came up with himself. Pierson‚Äôs broadcast would start out with a market report, letting the audience know what the prices were and what goods were selling. Each day they would have a ‚Äúphoned-in‚Äù report from one of the markets in the state, including Oklahoma City, Ringling, Enid, Pawhuska, Chickasha, etc. Next in his thirty-minute program, Pierson would report on agricultural news of national importance as well as news from within the state. Pierson retired from broadcasting in 1983. Retirement After retiring from WKY, Pierson spent a lot of time at the fairground, first with his own business, and then as supervisor of the feed and bedding services. Pierson worked in this capacity as a state fair consultant since 1983. Pierson also remained an active alumni at Oklahoma state university, and kept in touch with the agriculture department. Pierson‚Äôs wife, Bernice, died in 2002. They were married for 67 years before she died. His oldest daughter, LaNese, died in 2013. Pierson died on March 31, 2015, at 103 years. Keeping in tradition with the poetic sign-offs in his broadcasting career, Pierson left a final poem to be read at the end of his life. Never let a single day go by Without a kind gesture or an act. And always tell those that you love, Your affection for them is fact. For our time on this earth is short, Compared to what lay ahead. And with Christ accompanying our journey, That next step is absent dread. So to all I leave behind, And friendships I've held dear. May Peace be with you until we meet again, And may your days be filled with cheer. Awards and achievements Pierson lived a long life full of achievement.

The game is influenced by tokusatsu TV shows, particularly the Super Sentai and Power Rangers franchises. The game's development was funded via Kickstarter. The game was released on April 30, 2015 for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. Digital distribution is available through Steam and GOG.com. Chroma Squad was released in early 2017 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, iOS and Android mobile devices, being published by Bandai Namco Entertainment. A PlayStation Vita version was planned, however was ultimately cancelled. It was announced to be released on May 19, 2017 on PSN for PlayStation 4. It was also released for Nintendo Switch on Aug 1, 2019. Plot The game follows a team of stunt actors that tired of their previous job, decide to start their own Tokusatsu company, assisted by a mysterious artifact they find known as \\"Cerebro\\". Gameplay Once the studio is established, the player must assign the actors, each with their own special traits, to their respective roles in the team and their suits' colors. Other features can be changed as the game progresses including the team's name, the name of their robot and their catchphrases. Each stage in the game is a different episode of the show in which the heroes fight a group of villains, sometimes followed by a battle between the team's giant mecha and an enlarged monster, and their performance during the episode take a direct impact on the show's ratings. High ratings increase the show's fanbase and revenue, which can be used to improve the studio and upgrade the team's equipment and mecha. The episodes are grouped into seasons and failure to complete the goals set by the sponsors at the end of each season will lead to a game over. The battles follow the heroes fighting initially in their normal selves, but later gaining the ability to transform, recovering their HP and obtaining special abilities. The \\"teamwork\\" function allows heroes to help each other during battle, be it reaching longer distances, dealing powerful attacks together, or combining their powers into a special attack that increases ratings when used to destroy the monster of the week. Reception Chroma Squad received mixed to positive reviews from critics upon release. On Metacritic, the game holds scores of 75/100 for the PC version (based on 21 reviews), and 74/100 for the PlayStation 4 version (based on 7 reviews). Rights dispute The rights were disputed by Saban Brands. An agreement was reached where Saban was given a royalty share of the project.

Knowledge about this is sparse, with an absence of specific studies and literature. Description Pinna rudis has a shell that commonly reaches a length of .Conchology The rough pen shell has a pair of very fragile, long, triangular, wedge‚Äìshaped valves, covered with large, protruding scales arranged in quite regular rows. These scales are more prominent close to the opening of the shell. A half-dozen low ribs radiate from the pointed end and run the length of the valves. Said valves are almost symmetrical, toothless, and transparent on the ends. Their color is usually reddish brown. The spiny fan-mussel lives with the pointed anterior end of its shell vertically anchored to rock or firm sediment by numerous byssus threads. The rear edge of the shell is rounded and free. P. rudis may be confused with juveniles of Pinna nobilis, but the former shows a more triangular and robust shell, with fewer and larger protruding scales. Moreover, in P. rudis, the color is more brown or pink-orange, while in juveniles P. nobilis, it is homogeneously yellowish. Lastly, the adults of P. nobilis easily exceed the size of P. rudis and totally lose the protuberances on the surface of the shell. Also, the habitats of the two species are different, as P. nobilis can be found on muddy or sandy bottoms, while P. rudis prefers rock crevices.AIAM ItaliaDORIS ‚Äì Donn√©es d‚ÄôObservations pour la Reconnaissance et l‚ÄôIdentification de la faune et de la flore SubaquatiquesASPIM Distribution This species is found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean (Azores, Saint Helena, Morocco), in the Mediterranean (Strait of Gibraltar, Almeria, Lipari, Sicily, Tyrrhenian Sea, Ionian Sea), in the Black Sea and in the Caribbean waters, ranging from the Gulf of Mexico and southern Florida to the West Indies and Bahamas.Natura Mediterraneo Habitat This species lives in small patches of sand in rocky bottoms and in rock crevices, at depths ranging from the surface to 60 m.Pacheco, Ricardo J; Barreiros, J.

During Marlowe's 30-year career he would appear in over 200 feature films, as well as dozens of television shows. Early life Born on January 20, 1904 in Massachusetts, he entered the film industry in the early 1930s; while some sources have him in films as early as 1931, the American Film Institute has his earliest film appearance in Howard Hawk's 1934 film, Twentieth Century, starring John Barrymore and Carole Lombard. Career Marlowe's prolific film career involved small roles in many notable films. Some of those films include: the 1935 John Ford comedy, The Whole Town's Talking, starring Edward G. Robinson and Jean Arthur; Howard Hawk's classic romantic comedy, Bringing Up Baby (1938), starring Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn; 1940's My Favorite Wife, againg starring Grant, this time with Irene Dunne; the two classic biopics One Foot in Heaven (1941), starring Fredric March and Martha Scott, and Sergeant York (1941) starring Gary Cooper; Alfred Hitchcock's 1942 thriller, Saboteur, with Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane; the 1945 musical Anchors Aweigh, starring Frank Sinatra, Gene Kelly, and Kathryn Grayson; 1942's Bob Hope and Bing Crosby buddy film, Road to Utopia; the 1942 Danny Kaye vehicle, The Kid from Brooklyn, which also stars Virginia Mayo; Michael Curtiz's classic biopic of Cole Porter, Night and Day (1946), starring Cary Grant and Alexis Smith; Hitchcock's 1946 thriller, Notorious, with Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman, and Claude Rains; The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (1947), again starring Kaye and Mayo; and the 1948 classic swashbuckler, The Three Musketeers, starring Gene Kelly, Lana Turner and an all-star cast. The 1950s would see Marlowe continue his numerous film appearances, while he would also branch out into the new medium of television. Notable films in which he appeared during the decade include: Joan of Arc (1950), starring Ingrid Bergman; 1951's Flying Leathernecks, starring John Wayne and Robert Ryan; Trouble Along the Way (1953), another Wayne film, this time also starring Donna Reed and Charles Coburn; the classic 1954 version of A Star Is Born, with James Mason and Judy Garland; Otto Preminger's classic drama The Man with the Golden Arm (1955), starring Sinatra, Eleanor Parker, and Kim Novak; Joanne Woodward's tour de force in The Three Faces of Eve (1957). Although the Internet Movie Database has him appearing in two films in 1961, AFI has his final film appearance as one of the taxi drivers in Hitchcock's classic thriller North by Northwest in 1959, starring Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint and James Mason. Interspersed with his film performances, Marlowe would make dozens of television appearances. His TV work included guest roles on: The Abbott and Costello Show, Adventures of Superman, The Millionaire, Dragnet, Perry Mason, and Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Death Marlowe died on March 30, 1964 at the age of 60 in Hollywood, California.

Introduced in August 1990, NETROOM was originally titled \\"LAN Memory Manager.\\" Version 1.0 of NETROOM was a re-packaged version of Helix's HeadRoom with the HeadRoom Network Extensions, bundled together and targeted to network users. NETROOM loaded network drivers into a virtual machine created using an expanded memory page frame. NETROOM allowed this virtual machine to run as a multitasked background process. NETROOM included support for Novell NetWare, Banyan VINES, and LAN Manager networks. NETROOM was originally available only in multi-user packs starting with a four user license. Helix introduced version 1.10 of NETROOM, in January 1991, with a single-user license. This version included support for Microsoft Windows 3.0, and added an integrated 286 and 386 expanded memory manager. The NETROOM 286/386 memory manager provided access to expanded memory and extended memory on Intel 80386 or newer systems as well as on Intel 80286 systems based on the Chips and Technologies NEAT chipset. In June 1991, NETROOM v2.0 added MS-DOS 5 compatibility and an automatic setup and configuration tool named \\"Customize.\\" NETROOM 2.0 continued to focus on virtual machine task-switching as its primary memory management technology. In January 1992, NETROOM v2.1 added a \\"Quantum\\" memory management feature which could relocate the system and video BIOS into the High Memory Area. In 1992 Helix licensed some of the technology from NETROOM 2.1 to Microsoft. This technology was incorporated into the EMM386 and MEMMAKER programs in MS-DOS 6, which was released in March 1993. Concurrently with the release of MS-DOS 6, Helix released NETROOM v3.0 which included the Helix Cloaking technology. NETROOM 3 contained a variety of cloaked utilities, including system and video BIOS licensed from Award Software, an animated screen saver, a disk cache, and a RAM drive. The final version of NETROOM, v3.04, was released in late 1994 and included compatibility with Windows 95.

The goal of the experiment is to identify physics beyond the Standard Model, namely, the conversion of muons to electrons without the emission of neutrinos, which occurs in a number of theoretical models. Project co-spokesperson Jim Miller likens this process to neutrino oscillation, but for charged leptons. Observing this process will help to narrow the range of plausible theories. The experiment will be 10,000 times more sensitive than previous muon to electron conversion experiments, and probe energy scales up to 10,000 TeV. Timeline Prior work Physicists have been searching for flavor violation since the 1940s. Flavor violation among neutrinos was proven in 1998 at the Super-Kamiokande experiment in Japan. In 1989, Russian physicists Vladimir Lobashev and Rashid Djilkibaev proposed an experiment to search for lepton flavor violation. The experiment, called MELC, operated from 1992 to 1995 at the Moscow Meson Factory at the Institute for Nuclear Research in Russia, before being shut down due to the political and economic crises of the time. In 1997, American physicist William Molzon proposed a similar experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Research and development on the MECO experiment began in 2001, but funding was pulled in 2005. Development Mu2e is based on the MECO experiment proposed at Brookhaven, and the earlier MELC experiment at Russia's Institute for Nuclear Research. Research and development for the Mu2e experiment began in 2009, with the conceptual design complete in mid-2011. In July 2012, Mu2e received Critical Decision 1 approval (the second of five critical decision levels) from the Department of Energy, about one month after initial review. Project Manager Ron Ray asserted, \\"I know of no other project that has received sign-off that quickly after review.\\" Funding of the Mu2e experiment was recommended by the Department of Energy's Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel, in its 2014 report. Construction and operation Groundbreaking on the detector hall took place on April 18, 2015, with the hall expected to be complete in late 2016. Commissioning of the experiment is anticipated in 2019, and preliminary results are possible by around 2020. The experiment is expected to run for three years. Later improvements to the detector may increase the sensitivity of the experiment by one to two orders of magnitude, allowing a more in-depth study of any charged lepton conversion that may be discovered in the initial run. Design Stages of the Mu2e experiment The Mu2e apparatus will be in length, and will consist of three sections. The total cost of the experiment is $271 million. Muon production Repurposed elements from the Tevatron collider will be used to generate and deliver an 8 GeV proton beam. The protons would be extracted from Fermilab's Delivery Ring through a non-linear third-integer resonance extraction process and sent in pulses to the tungsten target. These protons will then collide with the tungsten production target in the production solenoid, producing a cascade of particles including pions, which decay into muons. Mu2e will produce between 200 and 500 quadrillion (2√ó1017 to 5√ó1017) muons per year. For every 300 protons hitting the production target, about one muon will enter the transport solenoid. Transport The 4.5-Tesla magnetic field of a production solenoid will direct some of the particles produced into an S-shaped 2-Tesla evacuated transport solenoid, consisting of 50 separate superconducting electromagnets, which will select muons by charge and momentum, and carry the desired slow muons to the detector after some time delay. Detection On entering the detector solenoid, the muons will hit (and stop within) an aluminum target that is about 0.2 mm thick, entering orbitals around nuclei within the target. Any muons which convert into electrons without emitting neutrinos will escape these orbitals and enter the detector with a characteristic energy of around 105 MeV. The detector itself consists of two components: a straw tracker to measure the momentum of outgoing particles; and an electromagnetic calorimeter to identify which particle interactions to record for further study, identify what type of particle passed through the tracker, and to confirm the measurements of the tracker. An electron with energy of around 105 MeV will indicate that the electron originated in a neutrinoless muon conversion. In order to disturb the path of the electrons as little as possible, the tracker uses as little material as possible. The wire chamber tracker consists of panels of 15-micron-thick straws of metalized mylar filled with argon and carbon dioxide, the thinnest such straws ever used in a particle physics experiment. Electronics at each end of the straws will record the signal produced when electrons interact with the gas in the straw, allowing the trajectory of the electrons to be reconstructed. =Sensitivity= The rate of neutrinoless conversion of muons to electrons was previously constrained by the MEG experiment to less than 2.4√ó10‚àí12, and further constrained to 7√ó10‚àí13 by the SINDRUM II experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland. Mu2e has an expected sensitivity of 5√ó10‚àí17, four orders of magnitude beyond SINDRUM II, meaning that it will see a signal if as few as one in 100 quadrillion muons transforms into an electron. Collaboration , the Mu2e collaboration included 240 people from 40 institutions in six countries. The collaboration is led by co-spokespersons Douglas Glenzinski (Fermilab) and Jim Miller (Boston University). The project manager for Mu2e is Ron Ray; the deputy project manager is Julie Whitmore.

An invading flotilla would have to steam for more than a mile against the current (shown by arrow) while being detained ‚Äì by the chain boom ‚Äì under short-range battery fire. But the greatest danger was from improvised contact mines. The Fortress of Humait√° (1854‚Äì68), known metaphorically as the Gibraltar of South America, was a Paraguayan military installation near the mouth of the River Paraguay. A strategic site without equal in the region, \\"a fortress the likes of which had never been seen in South America\\", it was \\"the key to Paraguay and the upper rivers\\". It played a crucial role in the deadliest conflict in the continent's history ‚Äì the Paraguayan War ‚Äì of which it was the principal theatre of operations. Location of Humait√° Brazilian ironclad warships at last dash past the Fortress of Humait√°, 19th February 1868. By the Brazilian naval engineer and watercolourist Trajano Augusto de Carvalho (1830‚Äì1898). The site was a sharp horseshoe bend in the river; practically all vessels wishing to enter the Republic of Paraguay ‚Äì and indeed to steam onwards to the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso ‚Äì were forced to navigate it. The bend was commanded by a line of artillery batteries, at the end of which was a chain boom which, when raised, detained the shipping under the guns. The navigable channel was only 200 yards wide and ran in easy reach of the artillery. The fortress was protected from attack on its landward side by impenetrable swamp or, where this was lacking, defensive earthworks which, at their greatest extension, comprised a system of trenches stretching for 8 lineal miles (13 km), had a garrison of 18,000 men and deployed 120 cannon. At its zenith Humait√° was reputed to be impassable to enemy shipping. Humait√° in context. The small area where the Allies were bogged down for two and a half years in the wetlands of southwestern Paraguay. Notice the scale on the map. The widespread perception which it created in its heyday ‚Äì that Paraguay was a country difficult to invade ‚Äì may have induced its Marshal-President Francisco Solano L√≥pez to take unnecessary risks in foreign policy and, in particular, to seize government vessels and provinces of the much more populous Brazil and Argentina and to send armies to invade them and Uruguay. They united against him in the Treaty of the Triple Alliance. The war led to his country's utter defeat and ruin and the casualties were immense. A declared purpose of the Treaty of the Triple Alliance was the demolition of the Humait√° fortifications and that none others of that sort should be built again. However the fortress, though not by then invulnerable to the latest armour-plated warships, was a serious obstacle to the Allies‚Äô plans to proceed upriver to the Paraguayan capital Asunci√≥n and to recapture the Brazilian territory of Mato Grosso: it delayed them for two and a half years. It was taken in the Siege of Humait√° (1868), then razed pursuant to the Treaty. For present-day Paraguayans Humait√° is a symbol of national pride, standing for their country's unyielding will to resist. The ruins of the church of San Carlos Borromeo today. Part of the Fortress complex, the church was destroyed by naval gunfire during the War; being the only object in Humait√° visible to the Brazilian ironclads. Motives for its construction The key to Paraguay. The blue arrow shows the location of the fortress near the mouth of the River Paraguay. At the top of the map is the Mato Grosso, and the territory disputed between Brazil and Paraguay. (Source: Thompson, Plate VIII.) Key to Paraguay Paraguay is a landlocked country and for much of its history it was difficult of access, except by sailing from the Atlantic up the River Paran√° and hence the River Paraguay (see map)The map was published in Thompson, 1879, Plate VIII. as the early Spanish explorers had done. There were other means of ingress, but they would have required an invading force to be resupplied through difficult and hostile country. So the command of the river was key to the security of Paraguay, who feared and distrusted its two much largerBefore the War Brazil's population was about 10 million; Argentina's, about 1.5 million; Paraguay's, possibly 300‚Äì400,000: Bethell, 6. neighbours Brazil and Argentina. Anxiety about the Brazilian Empire In a long history of conflicts between the empires of Portugal and Spain in America, the Portuguese made numerous incursions ‚Äì some of them permanent ‚Äì into Spanish-claimed territory. Slave raids by Bandeirantes (frontiersmen from what is now Brazil) into the Jesuit Reductions of Paraguay carried off many Guaran√≠ inhabitants, who feared and despised the Brazilians. The boundaries between the two empires were not resolved and the conflicts continued after independence, when Portuguese America became the Empire of Brazil. Brazil had no practical access to its own territory of Mato Grosso except by sailing from the Atlantic Ocean up the River Paraguay (see map);So much so, that until 1910 (when a railway link was constructed between S√£o Paulo and Cuiab√°, capital of the Mato Grosso), the long sea and river journey through the South Atlantic ocean, the Paran√° and the Paraguay was the shortest practical route to the territory: Doratioto, 26. fear that Paraguay might interfere with the navigation was a source of conflict. Where Paraguay ended, and where the Mato Grosso began, was a matter of opinion. Anxiety about Buenos Aires The Spanish Viceroyalty of the River Plate occupied an enormous territory roughly coterminous with the modern-day territories of Bolivia, central and northern Argentina,It also claimed Patagonia, Tierra del Fuego and the Falkland Islands (Malvinas). Paraguay and Uruguay. Although it did not exist for very long (1776‚Äì1810) the Spanish Viceroy had his seat in the city of Buenos Aires. Upon becoming independent from Spain the city claimed and thought itself rightly to be the capital of an identical territory it called the United Provinces of South America. Other provinces ‚Äì especially Bolivia, Uruguay and Paraguay ‚Äì begged to differ and the Viceroyalty broke up in acrimony and warfare. In particular, Buenos Aires did not recognise the right of Paraguay to act independently and in 1811 sent an army under General Manuel Belgrano to try to prevent it. The Buenos Aires governor Juan Manuel Rosas, \\"who viewed Paraguay as an errant province\\" during his dictatorship (1835‚Äì52) tried to bring Paraguay to heel by closing the River Paran√° to commercial traffic (see Battle of Vuelta de Obligado). Buenos Aires province fell out with the other provinces of the Argentine Confederation and declared itself the independent State of Buenos Aires; it did not recognise Paraguay's independence even after the others had. It was not until quite late in the nineteenth century (1859) that a re-united Argentina formally recognised an independent Paraguay. Even so, the boundaries between Argentina and Paraguay were in dispute, notably the Chaco and Misiones territories. Defensive outlook of Paraguay Upon its independence in 1811 Paraguay tried to keep out of the anarchy of adjoining Hispanic America. Its formidable dictator Jos√© Gaspar Rodr√≠guez de Francia (1820‚Äì1840) imposed a strict policy of isolation. During his reign few were allowed to enter Paraguay, or to leave it. Professor Williams' assessment: \\"In an attempt to coerce Paraguay economically and bring it to its knees, Buenos Aires only stiffened Paraguayan nationalism and produced a voluntary, xenophobic isolation of the breakaway province\\". After Francia's death he was succeeded by Carlos Antonio L√≥pez, (called ‚ÄòL√≥pez I‚Äô by some authors,For example, Thompson. a convenient if inaccurate designation), the father of Francisco Solano L√≥pez (‚ÄòL√≥pez II‚Äô). L√≥pez I did open up Paraguay to foreign trade and technology,Williams, 1971, chs. 6‚Äì7.} but the steamship made his country vulnerable to invasionSailing vessels could take 6 months to sail from Buenos Aires to Humait√°: Burton, 295 and he understandably feared the machinations of his powerful neighbours. During his presidency there were conflicts, not only with Brazil and Buenos Aires, but also the United States: the affair of 1855 in which the fort of Itapir√∫ fired upon an American warship, which led to a US naval expedition against Paraguay in 1858.Williams,1979, ch 10. Although Carlos L√≥pez was astute enough to know when to back down, he resolved to make Paraguay immune to foreign attack in future. Immediate cause of its construction The Guard-House of Humait√°. Engraving in the Illustrated London News, 1864. The image appears to have been made earlier. In 1777, in colonial times, a modest guardia (fortlet or lookout post) was established at Humait√°, a place about 15 miles above the mouth of the River Paraguay. However, a more formidable version was built in stages on the orders of L√≥pez I. He started the work hurriedly in 1854 during conflict with Brazil over boundaries and navigation, when Paraguay was threatened by a Brazilian flotilla; fortunately for L√≥pez, the Brazilians were delayed by the low state of the river. The Paraguayan author and diplomat Gregorio Ben√≠tes ‚àí who was in the Paraguayan army at the time ‚àí gives a different explanation. L√≥pez I, hearing the Brazilian squadron was on its way, immediately transferred 6,000 troops from Paso de Patria to Humait√°; working night and day, in 15 days they fortified that place, including furnaces for making red hot cannonballs.Warships at that time were always of wood. The Brazilian squadron desisted because of the strength of the fortifications; the low state of the water is mentioned only incidentally. Thomas Jefferson Page USNThe commander of USS Waterwitch, which vessel explored the region in the 1850s. wrote an independentBenites' version was not published until 1904; Page's version was published in 1859. account that tends to confirm Benites' version.Wrote Page: \\"The river defense [Humait√°] was pushed on with great rapidity, and is of such strength that I believe it might have arrested the ascent of the squadron... The expedition was at that time a failure\\". Initial works To a design by the Hungarian colonel of engineers Wisner de Morgenstern, he hastily fortified the river's left bank with a few batteries, which were continually but slowly augmented, and a trench was dug on the land side enclosing the rear of them. He felled the virgin forest, leaving only a few scattered trees, grubbed up the roots, and laid out the first batteries, to whose completion some two years were devoted. By January 1859 the installation appeared formidable. As described by an eyewitness aboard , part of the Paraguay expedition sent by President Buchanan to demand reparations for wrongs alleged to have been done to the United States > Sixteen ominous apertures pointed their gloom, and whatever else they may > contain, upon us; and, like the eyes of the figure in the picture, seemed to > follow the vessel's motion ...

Numerous other batteries were noticed. Fulton, having left the rest of her squadron behind, was allowed to proceed upriver. The works, which were continually extended, were supervised by British engineers, of whom there were a considerable number on contract to the government of Paraguay. Description of the finished fortress Detailed plan of the Fortress of Humait√°, showing the batteries and other installations. Evolved by Brazilian military surveyors late in the War, it also shows the Allied lines of circumvallation. (This image is best viewed at high resolution.) Another plan of the Fortress of Humait√° made by the Polish-Argentine officerWarren, 1985. Roberto Adolfo Chodasiewicz (1832‚Äì1891). Location The fortress of Humait√° was situated on a level cliff about 30 feet (10 metres) above the river, on a sharp horseshoe bend. The bend, called the ‚Äò‚Äô‚ÄôVuelta de Humait√°‚Äô‚Äô‚ÄôHumait√° bend. was an ideal strategic pinch point. It was some long; the navigable channel narrowed to only broad; the current was and in places , difficult for the ships of the day to stem; and (a matter that was to horrify the Brazilian navy) ideal for the release of ‚Äòtorpedoes' (nineteenth century floating naval mines). An unpleasant surprise for an invading flotilla was that, owing to the peculiar conformation of the river bed, there were \\"treacherous backwaters which often neutralize the action of the rudder, in direct proportion to the length of vessels\\".According to Artur Silveira da Mota, (Baron Jaceguai, commander of the Brazilian ironclad Barroso, who tried it), cited in Tasso Fragoso III, 409. (Wikipedia translation.) =First impression= The explorer Captain Sir Richard Burton, who visited the scene during the war ‚Äì when the Brazilians were still dismantling the fortifications ‚Äì described it thus: > The sweep is more than usually concave, to the benefit of gunnery and the > detriment of shipping. Nothing more dangerous than this great bend, where > vessels were almost sure to get confused under fire, as happened at Port > Hudson to the fleet commanded by Admiral D. G. Farragut. The level bank, > twenty to thirty feet above the river, and dipping in places, is bounded by > swamps up-stream and down-stream. Earthworks, consisting of trenches, > curtains and redans, disposed at intervals where wanted, and suggesting the > lines of Torres Vedras, rest both their extremities upon the river, whose > shape here is that of the letter U, and extend in gibbous shape inland to > the south.

The channel The 200-yard wide navigable channel ran close to the east bank i.e. the river batteries. River batteries The Londres Battery of the Humait√° fortifications. Although this image by E.C. Jourdan of the Brazilian engineering corps has become iconic, it shows it in a state of part dismantlement. In reality the embrasures were protected by heaped earth. Batteries of the Fortress of Humait√° according to E.C. Jourdan (1871) of the Brazilian corps of engineers. An invading force, if steaming around the bend upriver, would have to pass eight fixedThere were also moveable batteries, e.g. the Bateria Carbone which was trained on the coal bunkers. batteries, all capable of concentrating fire on the reentrant angle. Furthermore shipping was within range of the heavy guns well before arriving at the bend, and well after it. The batteries are variously named in the sources, and the number of guns may not have been constant.In the ensuing description the naming of the batteries follows Burton, 1870, who visited the site in 1868 while the Allies were still dismantling the batteries, and whose principal informants were the Brazilian military. A different naming convention is available in Nakayama & Nakayama, 2013 and the map by E.C. Jourdan reproduced in this section of this Article.. =Preliminary batteries= First the invading force had to pass the Humait√° redoubt, armed with a single 8 inch (20 cm calibre) gun. It must then pass the Itapir√∫ (seven guns); the Pesada [heavy] (five guns), all partly revetted with brick; the Octava or Madame LynchEliza Lynch was L√≥pez II's mistress. (three guns en barbette); the Coimbra (eight guns); and the Tacuar√≠ (three guns). =The Bater√≠a Londres= Next, the invading flotilla must pass the Bater√≠a Londres (so called because most of the t√©cnicos in Paraguay were recruited by the Limehouse, London, firm of J. & A. Blyth).Pl√°, 1970, 349-351, 358, 363, 373, 377, 381. Its walls were thick. It was supposed to be rendered bomb-proof by layers of earth heaped upon brick arches, and there were embrasures for 16 guns. \\"Of these ports\\" said Burton \\"eight were walled up and converted into workshops, because the artillerymen were in hourly dread of their caving in and crumbling down.\\" =The Bater√≠a Cadenas= As a climax the invading force would come alongside the Bateria Cadenas (Chain battery, for it protected the chain boom), backed by the Artillery Barracks. According to a survey by the Brazilian engineering corps this battery had 18 guns.Jourdan (atlas), map 12, reference P. The chain boom The boom across the river, intended to detain shipping under the guns, is variously described in the sources. Richard Burton and Commander Kennedy RN said it comprised 7 chains twisted together, of which (wrote Burton) the largest had a 1.75 inch diameter link. It was made fast to a windlass supported by a house about 100 yards from the bank. Nearer the battery stood a still larger capstan. Other sources,Including Masterman, 139, and Schneider, 1902, II, 115. notably George Thompson (de facto chief engineer of Paraguayan army) wrote that there were three chains side-by-side, of which the heaviest had 7.5 inch links, sustained by barges and canoes.Thompson, 239. The official staff report of Allied force that captured Humait√°, dated 29 July 1868, by Cordeiro T√¥rres e Alvim, said that on both banks of the river there were seven chains which, after entering the water, were bound to three. The latter were partly sustained by large floating iron boxes. Approach Approach to Humait√°. The River Paraguay from its mouth to the river batteries of Curuz√∫ and Curupayti. Base map by Emilio Carlos Jourdan (1838-1900). Before even arriving at the Vuelta de Humait√° an invading squadron would first have to navigate the River Paraguay from its mouth, and run the gauntlet of such batteries as the Paraguayans were able to deploy on its left bank, particularly at Curuz√∫ and Curupayty. Whether unarmoured warships could have done so without being sunk was never ascertained; during the War the unarmoured wooden vessels of the Brazilian Navy did not attempt it.To deter wooden vessels, the battery installation at Curupayty included a furnace for producing red hot cannonballs. It was never used because the wooden vessels kept out of range. (Thompson, 100.) Although heavily iron-plated ships ought not be sunk by these river batteries, their very weight and size made them difficult, and at times impossible, to navigate in the shallow waters of the River Paraguay. As Commander Kennedy of the Royal Navy observed: > The river Paraguay presents no important obstacles to navigation, the > principal point to observe being the [seasonal] rise of the water; this > varies sometimes as much as three fathoms [5 1/2 metres] ... The danger > attendant on grounding in the Paraguay is ... [that it] has a sharp rocky > bottom ...

'Torpedoes' Brazilian ironclad Rio de Janeiro sunk by a 'torpedo' in front of Curuz√∫. Painting by Adolfo Methfessel (1836-1909). Paraguayan 'torpedoes' and other weaponry. From an 1867 illustration by the Brazilian military engineer Conrado Jac√≥ de Niemeyer (1831-1905). Torpedoes of both the floating and underwater (moored) types are illustrated. On the left are Paraguayan armour-piercing ordnance, of which L√≥pez had a limited supply. For an invading force of ironclads the most dangerous aspect of Humait√°Not only the fortress itself, but its outworks e.g. at Curuz√∫ and Curupait√≠. was not the artillery batteries but the 'torpedoes' that could be released in the confined, shallow and uncharted stream of the River Paraguay. These torpedoes were improvised contact mines. The first was devised by \\"a Yankee, Mr. Kr√ºger\\". They consisted of a zinc cylinderThe cylinder was placed inside two other boxes in an attempt, often futile, to stop the powder getting wet: Thompson, 154. containing a charge of gunpowder.Typically 1,000 lbs (450 kilos). The largest ever made used a charge of 1,500 lbs (680 kilos) and the explosion shook the ground at the town of Corrientes, Argentina twentyThompson says forty, but the direct-line distance is closer to 20 miles. miles off. The fuses were designed and made by George Frederick Masterman, chief apothecary to the Paraguayan Army: they were glass capsules of sulphuric acid which, when broken by striking a heavy object, ignited a potassium chlorate/sugar mixture. Although most of these devices failed to go off, except prematurely,They were set of by pieces of drift-wood, \\"or perhaps by inquisitive alligators\\" (Masterman, 139). one did sink the 1,000 ton Brazilian ironclad Rio de Janeiro killing 155 men, so they had to be taken seriously. Since a \\"torpedo\\" (simulated or real) was released almost every night, the Brazilian navy had to have patrol boats out rowing in three shifts which tried to spot the floating torpedoes; if they did, they attempted to hook their floats with grappling irons on long lines. Wrote Commander Kennedy RN, \\"It was a service of great danger\\". Apart from the more common floating type, which could be seen and removed, the Paraguayans deployed \\"torpedoes\\" moored to the river bed, which could not. These were a potent psychological barrier. Deploying the torpedoes was not without its dangers either. After Kruger's death ‚Äì he was blown up by one of his torpedoes ‚Äì the work was taken over by a Paraguayan called Ramos who had served an apprenticeship in England. He met the same fate, and the work was given to a Polish refugee named Michkoffsky. Michkoffsky used to take the torpedoes down the river in a canoe paddled by four boys. One day he was distracted and the boys absconded to the Allies with the torpedo: he was arrested, reduced to the ranks and sent to the front, where he was soon killed. An anonymous, if brave, Paraguayan diver tried to attach a torpedo to the Brazilian ironclad Brasil by hand: this was deduced when he was found entangled in her rudder-chains, drowned. The Paraguayans deliberately moored empty demijohns in the river to make the Brazilian navy suppose they marked the situations of torpedoes. It made them noticeably reluctant to navigate its waters. Landward defences; the Quadrilateral The Paraguayans had also taken precautions against Humait√° being seized from the landward side. Much of it was protected naturally by carrizal,\\"Land intersected by deep lagoons and deep mud, and between the lagoons either an impassable jungle or long intertwined grass, equally impenetrable\\": Thompson, 128. marsh or swamp, and where not, an elaborate system of trenches was constructed, eventually extending over with palisades and chevaux-de-fr√≠se at regular intervals, known as the Quadrilateral (Cuadril√°tero, Pol√≠gono or Quadrilatero in various language sources). These trenches mounted batteries where appropriate. The trenches and natural barriers are shown in the map reproduced in this section of this Article, which was drawn to scale by Lt. Colonel George Thompson (engineer) of the Paraguayan army; he personally made a detailed trigonometric survey of the ground. The map is corroborated by Burton's detailed verbal description based on his own inspection on horseback and on figures supplied to him by Lt. Colonel Chodasiewicz of the Argentine Army. Burton reported that the layout required a garrison of at least 10,000 men; at the time of the Siege of Humait√° the Allied Commander-in-chief estimated that it had 18,000 and possibly 20,000 men and 120 cannon not including the river batteries. =Flood defences= The colonel in charge of the Paraguayan military engineering George Thompson arranged for part of the Quadrilateral to be protected by flood defences. The Quadrilateral had a weak spot or potential invasion point at Paso G√≥mez (the Spanish word \\"paso\\" denotes a pass), denoted on the map in this Section. But by damming the Estero Bellaco N.Known in other sources as Estero Rojas. at where it entered the zone denoted \\"Thick Jungle\\" he raised the water level at Paso G√≥mez by more than 6 feet (2 metres). Further, he provided a sluice-gate. \\"Should the enemy get [in] and prepare for a rush ... the gate would be opened, and a terrible flood of water would carry them all before it into the 'carrizal'.\\" =Electrical telegraphy= In the final stages of the fortifications electrical telegraph lines were laid out from Humait√° and the points in the Quadrilateral to L√≥pez's headquarters at Pas√≥ Puc√∫;'At this important central point converged ten radii of telegraph wires coming from all points of the so-called \\"Quadrilateral\\"': Burton, 357. and he could instantly be informed‚Äîin Morse code‚Äîof an enemy attack on any point. George Thompson recorded that the Guaran√≠ became adept telegraphists. \\"The telegraphs were kept working all day, the commander of a division being obliged to report every little thing to L√≥pez, who was receiving these despatches all day long\\". =Headquarters= Earthworks protecting L√≥pez's house; the watchtower.

Painting (and title) by the Argentine general and watercolourist Jos√© Ignacio Garmend√≠a (1841-1925). (An Argentine flag flies over the captured watchtower.) L√≥pez II established his headquarters at Paso Puc√∫, one of the corners of the Quadrilateral (see map in this Section). Amongst orange groves stood the dwellings of L√≥pez, his mistress Eliza Lynch, and military officers who enjoyed his confidence e.g. Generals Barrios, Resqu√≠n, and Bruges; also Bishop Palacios, Lt Colonel George Thompson the chief engineer and Dr Stewart the surgeon-general. The houses were simple ranchos (austere dwellings) with thatched roofs. A quadrangle of large traverses or earthworks protected from Allied artillery fire his house, that of Mrs Lynch, and those of his servants. These earthworks were made of sods and the largest was said to contain 422,080 pieces. At the centre of the quadrangle was a mangrullo or watchtower. According to Burton the mangrullo's ladders were surrounded by hides and matting, \\"an unusual precaution intended to conceal petticoated ankles\\", for it was used by Mrs Lynch; and indeed a contemporaneous drawing by the Brazilian engineering corps does show, unusually for Paraguay, a mangrullo with a covered ascent.See the right-hand side of the map. A large military hospital was established halfway between Humait√° and Paso Puc√∫ and another one for field officers at Paso Puc√∫ itself. At Paso Puc√∫ there were two settlements for female camp-followers; they assisted in the hospitals and washed the soldiers' clothes. They were allowed no rations, and lived on what beef the soldiers gave them. There was a cemetery, and a prisoner-of war compound.37 Brazilian prisoners who attempted to escape, or merely failed to betray a plot to do so, were shot by firing squad: ibid.

Paper was in short supply but an ersatz version was improvised from caraguat√° (wild pineapple). =Unmapped terrain= Harper's Weekly: A Journal of Civilization, 1868.Vol. 511 p244.). The chain boom is marked at 1; the outwork of Curupaity at 5. While the Paraguayans were familiar with the ground, maps of the territory were, for the Allies, non-existent. The area lay in the province of √ëeembuc√∫, which is flat, low-lying and obscured by swamp or carrizal. For example, when they established their main camp at Tuyut√≠ in southern Paraguay the Allies did not realise they were placing it within earshot of the southwestern line of the Quadrilateral: the Sauce trench. They did not even know Humait√° was protected by the Quadrilateral: In his 5-volume work on the Paraguayan war the Brazilian historian Tasso Fragoso insists that a Brazilian high command letter of April 1867 > does not leave the slightest doubt that the allies were completely ignorant > not only of the topography of the terrain [to the south-east of the > fortress], but that all of it was protected by lines of [Paraguayan] > entrenchments. Paraguayan soldiers mooning at the Brazilian observation balloon. Propaganda cartoon in the Paraguayan government newspaper El Centinela, 8 August 1867. In order to gradually map the area the Allies were obliged to resort to mangrullos (improvised watch towers) or (a first in South American warfare) captive observation balloons,}} but the Paraguayans obscured the terrain by lighting fires of damp grass. The Chaco side On the opposite bank of the River Paraguay begins the area known as the Gran Chaco, with a different, hot, semi-arid climate. This part of the Chaco, now part of Argentina, but in dispute in those days, was inhabited by none except the fierce Toba nomads. The Chaco bank of the River Paraguay is low, and liable to flooding. In front of Humait√° the land was quite impracticable as far as Timb√≥ which, when the river was high, was completely under water. (Later, military roads were made through there at vast effort.) Later in the war, when the Allies started a flanking movement to the southeast of Humait√°, L√≥pez sent and had the Chaco explored, and gave orders to build a road through the Chaco from Timb√≥ (the nearest place on the coast opposite Humait√° where a landing could be effected). > The road through the Chaco was tolerably straight, and was fifty-four miles > long. It did not follow the course of the River Paraguay, but went inland. > The great part of the road went through deep mud, and five deep streams had > to be crossed, apart from the River Bermejo. Once he appreciated his position was hopeless, L√≥pez used this road to escape from Humait√° with the bulk of his troops and artillery. They were ferried from Humait√° to Timb√≥ by two Paraguayan paddle steamers, and on canoes. Strategic significance and perception At least before the introduction of iron-plated warships, Humait√° had the reputation of being impregnable, and it became famous as the \\"Sebastopol of South America\\". During the war the European press compared it to the Richmond and Vicksburg of the American Civil War. It was also famed in Europe and the United States as the Gibraltar of South America. Michael Mulhall, editor of the Buenos Ayres Standard, passed the site in 1863 and reported it to the world in these terms:And quoted in Burton, 315‚Äì316, who may, however, have been quoting an earlier version published in the Buenos Aires Standard.. When L√≥pez I built Humait√° all warships were made of wood, and steamships were mostly paddle-driven. Wooden paddle-steamers, if intending to proceed into Paraguay, would have had to steam, against the current, past the succession of batteries ‚Äì where the range was or lessBecause the stream was 200 metres broad (Burton, 313) but the canal passed close to the bank (Mulhall, 84) ‚Äì and somehow cut through the boom of twisted chains, without being sunk: this appeared to be impossible. While it might have been possible for an army to invade Paraguay without going past Humait√°, any such attempt would have been problematical. The only practicable alternative route ‚àí used by General Belgrano when he unsuccessfully invaded Paraguay in 1811 ‚àí led through the Upper Paran√° and hence north through difficult country towards Villa Rica. This alternative route was considered by the Allies in 1865, but rejected as too difficult.In describing this route Burton says it starts from the \\"Lower Paran√°\\", a slip in nomenclature. The portion of the river above its confluence with the Paraguay is properly called the Upper Paran√°. A modern appreciation by Professor Whigham: Whigham said it was \\"a fortress the likes of which had never been seen in South America\\". For Professor Francisco Doratioto, Humait√° (and environs) was the principal theatre of operations of the Paraguayan war. Weaknesses In fact, Humait√° was not invulnerable, at any rate after a sufficient supply of river-navigating ironclad warships became available in South America. Indeed Burton, having inspected the captured site, thought that its potency had been greatly exaggerated ‚Äì to the point that it was a bluff. The commander of the Portuguese war vessel Zarco, also there at the time, wondered how Humait√° could have humbled a powerful navy for so long. Defective weaponry The last remaining Paraguayan artillery pieces at Humait√° collected for distribution between the Allies as war booty. \\"There were sundry old tubes bearing the arms of Spain; two hailed from Seville, the San Gabriel (A.D. 1671) and the San Juan de Dios (1684)\\". Although Paraguay could and did manufacture large artillery guns, there was nevertheless a shortage‚Äîpartly because guns had to be taken to reinforce the landward artillery ‚Äì and not all of the guns at Humait√° were of acceptable standard. When Burton inspected them (August 1868) he noted that many had been thrown into deep water but the remainder were poor: However, Burton may well have been underestimating the Paraguayan artillery at its zenith: according to both Thompson and Jourdan, some guns had already been evacuated to the Chaco side by the Paraguayans when abandoning the fortress. The gunboat HMS Dotterel, while anchored at Humait√° for three hours in June 1865, from the river counted 116 guns, a number far greater than was recorded by Burton or Jourdan when inspecting the captured fortress.For Dotterel's observations see below, Defective fortifications. Defective fortifications According to Burton the system of fortification lacked the latest developments, mostly using the obsolete en barbette system which failed to protect the defending artillerymen. The consequence: Other observers formed similar impressions.

The British gunboat HMS Doterel,Sometimes spelled Dotterell. which had passed the site in 1865Doterell had called at Humait√° on 4 June 1865 on her way to Asunci√≥n with the intent of repatriating British subjects. (long before it was damaged in the war) likewise thought the artillerymen were far too exposed,Pakenham, June 7, 1865. Wrote a British diplomat aboard Doterel: > We counted 116 pieces of cannon, heavy and light, but all of these pieces, > with the exception of one heavy battery of 16 guns [the Londres], are en > barbette, and the crews of the guns are utterly unprotected from shell, > canister, or rifle bullets.

Obsolescence , the first monitor (1861). L√≥pez I fortified Humait√° in the era of the wooden paddle-steamer warship. Gloire, the first ironclad warship was not launched until 1859 and that was in France, intended for a blue-water navy;Between Tres Bocas and Humait√° the river was shoal: sometimes less than two fathoms (Kennedy, 104). and no battles between European ironclads had actually happened. However, the evolution of the navies in the American Civil War (1861‚Äì65) had fulfilled a demand for heavily armoured vessels that could navigate in river waters. The Battle of Hampton Roads, in which iron-armoured Union and Confederate warships were unable to sink each other, dramatically demonstrated their resistance to heavy artillery. News of this naval engagement arrived in the River Plate on 14 May 1862 and was reported in the Buenos Aires Standard in these terms:The Standard, Buenos Aires, 14 May 1862, page 2. > The two steel vessels commenced a cannonade a mile apart, without doing any > damage on either side. In less than an hour and a half they were alongside, > and then raged so terrible an encounter that both vessels were enveloped in > smoke. Two balls from the Monitor entered her adversary's cuirass; as soon > as the wind cleared away the smoke the Monitor was seen running round > Merrimac, looking for a vulnerable point, the vessels being about 35 yards > apart ...

Wooden men of war were declared, in the House of > Commons, to be useless, and the Admiralty had stopped all the fortifications > and arsenals, to devote all attention to the construction of a steel fleet > 35 in number. Apart from the more conventional ironclads, which the Brazilian navy could order from Britain or France, as noted the AmericansTo be precise the monitor warship was invented by John Ericsson, a Swede, and offered to the French navy, but it was the Americans who had brought this type to fruition during the Civil War. had invented the monitor, an armoured, shallow draft, turreted vessel that presented little superstructure to enemy fire; monitors could be and were built in Brazil. Thus by the time Lopez II fired the first shots against Brazil (December 1864) the Humait√° defences were obsolescent to the latest naval weaponry that could be manufactured or purchased. Brazil was an enormous country and after the war broke out it could have (and soon did have) at least 10 ironclads. That said, an ironclad naval force, by itself, was unlikely to pose a strategic threat to the Paraguayan nation. For assuming the latest ironclads could get past Humait√° ‚Äì which they eventually did ‚Äì it did not follow that unarmoured troopships could do so. Without the logistical support of an invading army, ironclads could not have operated far ahead of their lines of supply, except temporarily.When the Brazilian ironclads did force the passage of Humait√° some of them proceeded upriver as far as Asunci√≥n; however, they were soon obliged to return. Lack of tautness in the chain boom Chain boom. Thompson was critical of the design of the chain boom at Humait√°. At Fort√≠n he designed this chain boom made of timb√≥ logs joined endwise by iron shackles. Since it floated underwater it could not be sunk by naval gunfire. Even heavily armoured vessels might have been impeded by the chain boom, but it turned out to have an Achilles' heel: it could not be drawn tight enough without intermediate floating supports ‚Äì and these might be sunk by naval gunfire. Burton's description of the chain boom was: > The chain, which consisted of seven twisted together, passed diagonally > through a kind of brick tunnel. On this side [of the River Paraguay] it was > made fast to a windlass supported by a house about 100 yards from the bank. > Nearer the battery stood a still larger capstan: the latter, however, wanted > force to haul tight the chain.In a different passage he says that there was > no donkey-engine to tighten it when it sagged following destruction of the > intermediate floating supports: Burton, 332. This was so provided an enemy destroyed the chain's intermediate floating supports; for as explained by Thompson, the chains were > supported on a number of canoes, and on three pontoons.According to Burton > they were supported by three chatas (barges): Burton, 332. According toHMS > Dotterell there were three great chains resting on 10 pontoons (Schneider, > 1902, II, 115). According to Masterman (chief pharmacist to the Paraguayan > forces, whose medical duties took him to Humait√°) they rested on \\"lighters\\" > ‚Äì which also served as floating prisons ‚Äì and on rows of piles.

The chain was > thus buried some two feet under the mud of the river, offering no obstacle > whatever to the navigation. Supplying the garrison Because the marshlands were not ideal for the raising of cattle or the cultivation of manioc or maize, and because the Quadrilateral required a large garrison, food for Humait√° needed to be brought in from elsewhere. However, it was a very difficult position to supply. Cut off by swamps, there was no easy overland communication with the nearest food- producing regions. There was a coastal road, but it was poor, unfitted for oxcarts or cattle droves during the winter floods. During the War there was a shortage of steam vessels; small river craft were difficult to land in winter. \\"Paraguay never resolved these transportation difficulties during the siege of Humait√°, and the army suffered the consequences\\", observed Professor Cooney. Even so, Humait√° withstood a siege of more than two years. Unintended consequences Francisco Solano L√≥pez (\\"L√≥pez II\\"), and his autograph. The Humait√° system was built to increase the security of Paraguay, but its strength, real or perceived, may have had the opposite effect in the end. Provocation of Brazil For Brazil, the fortifications posed a potential threat to its own security and caused it to make some preparations for war. As noted by Lt Colonel George Thompson of the Paraguayan army: Inducing overconfidence For Leslie Bethell, L√≥pez overestimated Paraguay's military power, which induced him to behave recklessly. According to Professor Bethell: For John Hoyt Williams, Humait√° was instrumental in generating the risk-taking behaviour: And: After the passage of Humait√°, the Buenos Ayres Standard wrote: > None who have ever seen the place have questioned its strength. Old > President L√≥pez had such implicit faith in its impregnability that he > believed if even a Xerxes attacked Paraguay he could not get past Humait√°. > The same implicit confidence in its strength was inculcated in the minds of > the Paraguayan people. Their watchword was 'Humait√°', and possibly to the > exaggerated idea of its strength by the present L√≥pez may be traced the > grave political error which step by step led this unfortunate man from the > cautious policy of his father to become the great champion of River Plate > equilibrium.Buenos Ayres Standard', February 25, 1868 (quoted in The > Times\\"\\", London, 7 April 1868, p. 5.) Alternative view A possible alternative view is that L√≥pez was aware that developments in naval warfare were making Humait√° obsolescent and so decided to take the offensive before Paraguay lost the balance of advantage altogether.So thought Thompson: \\"The mode in which President L√≥pez began the war on the Argentines was outrageous, but with Brazil war was apparently unavoidable; and had he not commenced the war when he did, Brazil would have taken Paraguay at a disadvantage: (Thompson, v.) Paraguay's chief engineer, the talented William Keld Whytehead, cannot have failed to become aware of the advantages of ironclad vessels and it is on record that in 1863 he obtained a British patent for an iron-cladded vessel. Indeed, L√≥pez himself only eight months after the Battle of Hampton Roads was pressing the American ambassador in Asunci√≥n to procure a monitor for him; and Paraguay placed orders for several ironclads to be built in European or Brazilian yards before the War. Further support for this view is afforded by L√≥pez's hesitation in seizing the Marques de Olinda. According to Thompson: Passage of Humait√° by an armoured squadron of the Brazilian navy. Engraving by Blanchard of a sketch by Jos√© Paranhos, (1819‚Äì1880), Brazil's Foreign Minister. In a propaganda coup, Paranhos drew this sketch from his imagination and sent it to the French magazine L'Illustration, Journal Universel,vol 51 p. 244, 1868. predicting the war would be over in a month. As against that, none of the sources cited in the article establish why L√≥pez declared war without waiting for his ironclads to be completed and delivered. According to Burton, \\"it was the general opinion\\" that with a single ironclad at their disposal the Paraguayans \\"would have cleared the river\\". He went further: > The war, indeed, was altogether premature: had the cuirassed ships and > Whitworths ordered by the Marshal-President begun the campaign, he might now > have supplied the place of Mexico with a third great Latin empire. Instead, at an early stage of the war Paraguay's wooden vessels, only oneTacuar√≠ had her boilers below the waterline (Thompson, 73). of which had been built as a warship, were defeated by a Brazilian wooden flotillaAll of them were purpose-designed warships, not converted merchantmen. at the Battle of the Riachuelo and so the River Paraguay was blockaded by the Brazilian navy, and the armoured ships that he had ordered could neither be delivered nor paid for. Brazil negotiated with the shipbuilders to transfer and complete the work-in-progress and eventually used the same ironclads to defeat Humait√°. Upshot A traditional view is that after the death of the cautious L√≥pez I, his son paid not enough attention to his father's dying words: to try to settle disputes with Brazil with the pen, not the sword. He was induced by the Uruguayan government to intervene in the Uruguayan War, which he did on 13 November 1864 by firing across the bows of and seizing the Brazilian governmentThe Marques de Olinda was captained by an officer of the Brazilian navy, subsidised by the Brazilian government, and carried the newly-appointed governor of the Mato Grosso, 10 soldiers and a large quantity of paper currency for use in the province. ship the Marques de Olinda as she was proceeding upriver on her monthly voyage to the Mato Grosso; he proceeded to seize the Mato Grosso itself. According to the American ambassador to Paraguay, Charles A. Washburn, Lopez explained his seizure of the Brazilian ship by saying \\"with more candor than discretion\\" that only by a war could the attention and respect of the world be secured to Paraguay; that although Paraguay was a small power in comparison with Brazil, it had \\"advantages of position\\" that gave her an equality of strength; and that the Paraguayan troops would be already \\"fortified and intrenched\\" before the Brazilians could arrive in any considerable numbers. Encouraged by the sluggish response of Brazil, infuriated by the mockery of the Buenos Aires press, and impatient at Argentina's refusal to permit him to invade a further Brazilian provinceRio Grande do Sul. through sovereign Argentine territory,The provinces of Corrientes or Misiones. on 13 April 1865, L√≥pez fired upon and seized two small Argentine naval vessels moored in the port of Corrientes and proceeded to take the Argentine province of that name and to make Paraguayan paper currency compulsory on pain of death. The resulting War of the Triple Alliance was to destroy his country. Treaty of the Triple Alliance The Treaty of the Triple Alliance against Paraguay was signed 1 May 1865 and specifically stated that Humait√° must be destroyed and never rebuilt.Protocol, article 1: \\"The fortifications of Humait√° shall be demolished, and... no other or others of that kind shall be permitted to be constructed, thereby interfering with the faithful execution of the treaty.\\" Article 18 provided that the terms of the treaty should be kept secret until its \\"principal objective\\" had been attained; Consul Thomas Hutchinson thought that referred not to the deposition of L√≥pez but to the demolition of Humait√°. Numerous political objectives are expressly mentioned in the treaty but no other military ones. On the same day, the Allied High Command agreed a strategic plan, the first point of which read: > The objective of the campaign operations ‚àí to which [all] military > operations and [invasion] routes must be subordinated ‚àí should be the > position of Humait√°.Wikipedia translation. And:- Effectiveness in practice Despite Burton's stricturesBurton's critique was this: an active and competent enemy would soon have forced the passage of Humait√°, whose strength had been much exaggerated. (Burton, 332 and passim, and compare 234). However this may have been somewhat unfair, or Eurocentric. The Allied officer corps had no prior experience of the type of warfare they were engaged in. See e.g. Dudley, 107-8. the Fortress of Humait√° was a serious obstacle to the Allies‚Äô plans to proceed upriver. On it being announced in Buenos AiresOn April 17, 1865. that Paraguay had fired upon and seized the Argentine naval vessels, President Mitre told a furious crowd that: In fact, the Allies did not occupy the Paraguayan capital until 5 January 1869,Pl√° 1976, 225. nearly four years after Mitre's speech. The mainAlthough Humait√° was not the only obstacle, for the Paraguayans improvised further strongpoints along the river Paraguay, none of those detained the Allies for as long. See MacDermot, xii-xiv. reason was the Humait√° complex. It may have been \\"only seven leagues by land\\" from Paso de Patria to Humait√°, but it was land that it necessary to traverse. After expelling the Paraguayans from Argentine soil the Allies landed in Paraguay and occupied Paso de Patria on 23 April 1866. They did not capture Humait√° until 5 August 1868.Pl√° 1976, 224. The Humait√° phase of the Paraguayan war is outside the scope of this Article. However, B.C. MacDermotMacDermot was the British Ambassador in Paraguay from 1968 to 1972. thus summarised the difficulties: An additional cause of delay, according to Professor Williams, was the long pause after the debacle of the Battle of Curupayty when the Allies overestimated the strength both of the opposing army and of Humait√°: they allowed L√≥pez almost a year to rebuild his forces, devastated at the Battle of Tuyut√≠. Endgame A Brazilian flag flies over the watchtower of captured Humait√°. On the right a Brazilian ironclad is moored to the river bank. (From a soldier's photographic album preserved at the National Library of Brazil.) The endgame: the Allies close round Humait√°. It took the Allies more than two years to go the \\"seven leagues\\" from the invasion point at 1 to the fall of the fortress at 2. Note the scale on the map is only 10 miles. (Base map sketched by Commander A.J. Kennedy, R.N.)On 19 February 1868 when the river was unusually high six Brazilian ironclad vessels were ordered to dash past Humait√° during the hours of darkness, which they did with no great difficulty because by then the chain boom was anyway lying in the river bed.See the section Lack of tautness in the chain boom, above. The Paraguayans stopped resupplying Humait√° by river and it was starved out. The fortress was finally captured in the Siege of Humait√°, an operation that culminated on 5 August 1868. It was razed pursuant to the Treaty of the Triple Alliance. It was the decisive year of the Paraguayan War.

Jones. During her time at Newnham College, Cambridge, she originally intended to study Botany but soon switched to Geology where she received first class marks in her final exams in 1939. She was awarded her PhD in Geology in 1949 for her work along the Church Stretton fault zone and the area west of the Knighton Sheet afterwards she worked at Birmingham University. In 1953 she was appointed assistant lecturer in the Geology Department at Aberystwyth University, and became a full lecturer in 1955 and continued in the department even after her retirement in 1983. It was reported on her death that she was a committed Marxist with the Red Flag been played at her service. After her death, the Nancy Kirk Viewpoint was created, through donations by former students and colleagues that is situated at the northernmost point of Pant Da nature reserve.  Early life  Nancy Kirk originally lived in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire from her birth in 1916 until 1935 when she left her hometown to attend Newnham College, Cambridge. Nancy and her brother were brought up by their father, as their mother died at a young age. Being a student with a single father, Nancy was used to living a simple way of life. Despite her personal financial difficulties when she was younger, Nancy made use of her time and money putting it into the things she had a passion for. Nancy had a large appreciation for museum artifacts saved most of her money to put towards the pieces that she admired.  Education  After being awarded the opportunity to study in the faculty of natural sciences of Newnham College, she moved to Cambridge. Nancy was originally interested in studying biological plant sciences, but found herself quickly losing interest because of how her classes were taught. Due to her lack of interest in botany, Nancy developed a newfound interest in geology and at this time credited to a professor she was inspired by, O. T. Jones. As of 1939 as a female she was unable to obtain a degree, but she still excelled in achieving high grades through her studies in geology. Nancy excelled in geology, winning awards like the Bathurst Prize. She was able to begin her research under her professor O. T. Jones. Nancy ended up leaving Cambridge in the wake of World War II when she was sent to work at the Royal Ordnance Factory in 1942. Shortly after the war, in 1945 Nancy was able to return to Cambridge. She remained at Cambridge for the rest of her studies and received her PhD later in 1949 when females could finally receive degrees. After receiving her doctorate, Kirk went to work in Birmingham at the University for 2 years before moving to live in her area of research, a country between Pontfaen, Breconshire, and Presteigne, Radnorshire.  Research  In the early 1940s her research was put aside due to the war until 1945 where she returned to Cambridge on a two year Jenner Research Fellowship. Nancy‚Äôs research took a vast majority of her time, especially her work on graptolites in the 1970s. After receiving her PhD in 1949, she continued her geological mapping. Nancy became an assistant lecturer then eventually a full lecturer in 1955. Nancy was known to care a lot for her students to succeed and put a lot of effort into her teaching. She presented her ideas about the evolutions of the graptolites in the late 1960s and carried out her research until her official retirement in 1983. Nancy began a major study on graptolites with the help from Dr. Denis Bates although their work remains to be published.  Field work  In the 1950s Nancy had done a lot of fieldwork and presented it at a meetings of the geological society. In one of the meetings only men could attend a geological dining club so Nancy was unable to attend. Her PhD was impressive, but the map that she submitted to get published was more descriptive and covered a larger area than her PhD did. She received backlash from editors and referees telling her that the map was large and had too much detail. She defended her paper by explaining how the information she had was important because it was critical for comprehending the map. She was able to convince them of the importance of the detail, but she had to shorten her paper because the Geological Society could not print long papers during this time. Because she had to shorten her work she created three draft texts. These draft texts still exist today and so do her field slips, however the original map cannot be found. In 1954 she was awarded the Murchison Fund for the work she accomplished.  Graptolites  In the 1960s Nancy originally used graptolites for identification and correlation in her research after her professor O.T.‚Äôs lead. Her findings were far more jurassic than she had originally envisioned and graptolites became her main focus of study by a fluke mistake. Reviewing her paleontology work from previous years before teachers she gaged an interest in graptolites and their sexual dimorphism. Kikr worked on the graptolite with Dennis Bates. Her success was due to the use of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to examine specimens and her collaboration with other previous works.  Awards  While at Newnham College, Cambridge, she received the Bathurst Prize, a Harkness Scholarship, and a Bathurst Research Studentship. In 1954, Kirk won the Munchison Fund of The Geological Society of the UK.  Personal life and legacy  She is remembered by her students is by her generosity and time she put into teaching them. Kirk put in effort into the brightest and weakest students equally making sure all her students moved forward and were able to learn what she was teaching. Nancy Kirk was also remembered for her outfits which is said to be seen as if she had just come from working in the field. Nancy Kirk was someone who preferred to live in isolation, and be able to spend time in her gardens as she had a taste for naturism. She also had an interest in art, which lead her to start pottery and become quite talented at it, especially when it came to making the glazes. Nancy Kirk also worked with a colleague from her department Bill Fitches, who provided her with the pots to use. Nancy Kirk dedicated her life to her work and her garden, in which she did not end up marrying anyone.

The church is located on a hill about north of Lake R√•varpen, a part of the Dalsland Canal. Approximately south of the church is a former clergy house, built in 1935. In the south part of the grave yard is a mourge built in the 1940s and a storage house built in 1995.  History  The church building is assumed to be the third in Tisselskog and like the former two, it is made out of wood. The first church was erected during the Middle Ages and was located about south of the present building. The second church was built in 1724‚Äì1727 on the same location as the present. The church tower and parts of the west wall in the present building are remnants of the second church.  Architecture  The current wooden church in simple Neo-Gothic style was built in 1877, designed by engineer Emil Olsson. The building is a rectangular nave with an uninterrupted wall in the east and the church tower as a part of the west wall. An extension of the building on the northeast side used to be a sacristy. The main entrance is on the west side through the church porch on the ground floor of the tower. Traces of the previous church can be seen in the porch as well as at the west wall inside the church. In the ceiling there are boards with paintings from the old church. The exterior walls covered with white-painted wood paneling and the pointed windows are angular, as are the shutters in the tower. The nave has a dual-pitched roof that is hipped in the east. The roofs of the nave and the former sacristy are made of slate, and tower has a copper-clad spire. The interior walls and the ceiling are clad with paneling, some of it from the 1910s.  Renovations  During a renovation of the church during 1915‚Äì16, the interior walls and ceiling were covered in panelling. The layout of the altar was changed by replacing the altarpiece with the original one from 1725. A stained glass choir window was installed as well as the old medieval baptismal font. During the 1960s and 70s plans for demolishing the barely century-old nave were being discussed. The church had been neglected for long and the value of the building was questioned, because of the disproportionately long nave and the short tower. Instead of tearing it down, a comprehensive renovation was made in 1977, under the supervision of architects Uno Asplund and Janne Feldt from Karlstad. The proportions of the nave were altered by making a hipped roof in the east section. The disposition of the building was also altered. The nave was shortened by building a new wall behind the altar. The room behind the altar became the new sacristy, while the old one in the extension was converted into facilities for the church staff. The area under the organ loft was sealed off with folding screens made of wood. The panelling on the west wall was removed to uncover the older timber walls with paintings.  Furnishings  The inventories in the church are: *The oldest object in the church is the soapstone baptismal font from the 13th century. The font is placed in the south part of the choir on a decorated wooden base. *The organ has ten stops and is built in 1977, by Magnussons Organ Constructors in Gothenburg. The organ is placed on the south side of the loft in order to accommodate a choir as well. *The altarpiece was made by Lars Hasselbom from Lidk√∂ping in 1735, in Baroque style and it consists of two paintings. The lower painting depicts the Last Supper and the one above it, the Ascension of Jesus. Both paintings were renovated in 1977. *The altar is made of light green, stained wood and was probably added in 1977. *Two hymn boards are mounted on the wall on opposite sides of the altar. They are probably from the 19th century. *The blue and pink pulpit is probably contemporary with the present building (1877). It was lowered and repainted in 1977, and a baldachin was added to it.

The original village of Edensor was located immediately next to Chatsworth House, but between 1838 and 1842 the 6th Duke of Devonshire had it moved out of sight over a hill. The planning of the new village and parish church was overseen by Joseph Paxton. St Peter's Church was rebuilt and expanded between 1867 and 1870 to the designs of the architect Sir George Gilbert Scott for the 7th Duke of Devonshire. It comprises a west steeple, nave with aisles, chancel, north vestry and south east chapel.

Mistaking that Yichen and Yimei are a couple, Mosheng followed her father's arrangements and moved to the United States to continue her studies. Seven years later, Mosheng - who is now a professional photographer - returns to China, and coincidentally bumps into the unforgettable Yichen.

The Type 035 is a heavily improved redesign of the older Type 033 Romeo-class submarines, which were built in China from 1962 to 1984. Background In 1963, under the 1950 Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, the Soviet Union passed to China the necessary design details in order to produce s.Korabli VMF SSSR, Vol. 1, Part 2, Yu. Apalkov, Sankt Peterburg, 2003, The Chinese variant became known as the Type 033 Romeo class, of which China built a total of 84 between 1962 and 1984. During the 1970s, China's ambition to create an indigenous submarine industry lead to the commissioning of Wuhan Ship Development and Design Institute (701 Institute) to design and build an improved submarine based on the Type 033 hull, named the Type 035 Ming class.Type 035 submarine (in Chinese), haijun360.com, Retrieved 1 May 2015 Two Type 035 boats were completed by 1974. Further improvements were deemed necessary and by the early 1980s a new and improved design, named the Type 035A Ming class were produced. The first of these improved \\"A\\" models entered service in 1982, with three more under construction. The latter three boats were completed and commissioned by 1990. The Type 035G Ming class is the most numerous variant. A total of 12 were built and commissioned between 1990 and 1999. They were built with further improvements, especially in terms of noise reduction, weapons, sensors and crew living standards. The PLAN refer to this sub-class as, \\"new wine in an old bottle\\". Two boats of the Type 035A were upgraded to same standard as the Type 035G. The most modern design variant is the Type 035B Ming class, which features a redesigned conning tower and portions of the hull, giving it a very similar appearance to the newer Type 039 submarines. Type 035B are capable of launching land attack cruise missiles from their torpedo tubes. A total of four boats were commissioned between 2000 and 2003. Variants *Type 035: First unit of the Ming-class submarine, with construction of two units begun simultaneously in October 1969 in Wuchang Shipyard and Jiangnan Shipyard. The general designer was Wei Xumin (È≠èÁª™Ê∞ë). The most significant difference between Type 035 Ming class and Type 033 Wuhan class is that the former is driven by a single shaft instead of twin shafts of the latter. Trials completed in October 1974 and this first unit (original pennant number 162, but later changed to 232) built at Jiangnan Shipyard entered Chinese service in the following month. *Type 035A: The second unit of the Ming-class submarine with pennant number 342 was built at Wuchang Shipyard, and many problems were discovered during its trials. As a result, the Chinese navy ordered 701st Institute to perform a major redesign, which not only solved the problem, but also increased the top speed by 40% to . The redesigned boat was completed in June 1980, and finally entered Chinese service on December 24, 1982, with a new designation of Type 035A. In December 1983, the decision was made to stop the production of a new Type 033-class boat and replace it with a Type 035A. After the completion of the first Type 035A in 1982, the production of Type 035 briefly halted, until 1987, when the production restarted again and 3 more units were completed before the production ended in 1990. *ES5C: Export version of Type 035/035A, with updated fire control system to launch acoustic homing torpedoes. There is no known export, but the design was used to upgrade Type 035/035A fleet. *ES5D: further development of ES5C for export, with capability to launch anti-ship missiles while submerged added. As with its predecessor ES5C, there is no known export but the design was used to upgrade Type 035/035A fleet. *Type 035G: Program begun in 1985, and the first unit with pennant number 356 was launched in 1989, entering service in December 1990, and state certification received in 1993. This is the first Type 035 series to have anti-submarine (ASW) capability. The primary weaponry for Type 035G is Yu-3 torpedo, and French sonar DUUX-5 and its Chinese-built version were used on later units, 12 of which were completed between 1990 and 1999. The last unit with pennant number 308 was lengthened by to add a section for AIP tests. *ES5E: Export version developed from Type 035G, with ability to launch wire-guided torpedoes added, but there is no known export. *Type 035ET: French sonar system and its equivalent Chinese version on ES5E export version of Ming was expensive, so a cheaper alternative was developed, using Italian sonar systems, the JP-64 active sonar and Velox passive sonar of the . However, this failed to attract any buyers and the unit went into Chinese service instead. *ES5F: Export version with integrated sonar system that integrates previously separated active, passive ranging, flank (and towed upon customer's request) sonar into one. *Type 035B: First batch of four completed between 2000 through 2003, and additional order followed sometimes later. Conning tower and certain portion of hull was redesigned, with new structure similar to that of Type 039 submarine. This type was capable of launching land attack cruise missiles from torpedo tubes.

He lives in Z√ºrich, Switzerland. Biography After studying art in Switzerland, Hans Feurer worked as a graphic artist, illustrator and art director for several advertising agencies in London. In 1966, after buying a Land Rover and leaving for Africa, he decided to embark as a professional photographer. He returned to London, rented a studio, and started working on his photographs. At the end of 1967, Hans Feurer‚Äôs work was recognized and his professional career officially launched. Photography In 1974, Feurer collaborated with Pirelli Calendar, as well as with famous fashion magazine for their time, Deutsch Sven and English Nova. Both magazines are no longer in print. 1983, Feurer had the opportunity to photograph a campaign for French luxury house, Kenzo with renowned model, Iman. Hans is one of the most effectively marked photographers of his generation and is often requested by fashion magazines such as Vogue, Elle, Numero and Another. Exhibitions In 2013, publishing company Damiani Editore gave Feurer the opportunity to publish a photography book, which ended up being the subject of an exhibition at the Parisian concept store, Colette, at the end of September 2013. In January 2014, Rome fashion week invited him, as guest of honor, to display some of his photographs. In June 2014, Hans showed a collection of his work at the Moscow contemporary art gallery RuArts, with the support of magazine Vogue in Russia.

Like all anemonefishes, it forms a symbiotic mutualism with sea anemones and is unaffected by the stinging tentacles of its host. It is a sequential hermaphrodite with a strict size-based dominance hierarchy; the female is largest, the breeding male is second largest, and the male nonbreeders get progressively smaller as the hierarchy descends. They exhibit protandry, meaning the breeding male changes to female if the sole breeding female dies, with the largest nonbreeder becoming the breeding male. Description A. latezonatus grows to and is dark brown with three white bars and a broad white margin on the caudal fin. As the common name suggests, the middle bar is very wide, about twice the average width of other anemonefishes and is shaped like a flat-topped pyramid. They have 10 dorsal spines, two anal spines, 15‚Äì16 dorsal soft rays, and 13‚Äì14 anal soft rays. Color variations A. latezonatus often has bright blue markings on the upper lip and the edges of the bars. The dorsal fin may be orange or yellow Image:Amphiprion latezonatus RLS.jpgA. latezonatus showing blue markings Image:Amphiprion latezonatus, embriones.jpgA. latezonatus showing orange dorsal fin Similar species The broad midbody bar is distinctive, and A. latezonatus is unlikely to be confused with any other anemonefish. The closest in appearance are A. polymnus (saddleback anemonefish) and A. sebae (sebae anemonefish), but A. latezonatus has a broader midband and lacks the characteristic slope of A. polymnus or A. sebae. Historically, anemonefish have been identified by morphological features and color pattern in the field, while in a laboratory, other features such as scalation of the head, tooth shape, and body proportions are used. These features have been used to group species into complexes, and A. latezonatus was considered as part of the saddleback complex with A. polymnus and A. sebae. Genetic analysis has shown that the saddleback complex is not a monophyletic group and that A. latezonatus has a monospecific lineage, and is more closely related to A. percula and Premnas biaculeatus than to the saddleback group. Image:Amphiprion Species.JPGA. polymnus (saddleback anemonefish) Image:Clown Fish Aquarium.JPGA. sebae (sebae anemonefish) Image:A. percula.jpgThe genetically related A. percula (clownfish) Image:Clownfish (Papua New Guinea).jpgThe genetically related Premnas biaculeatus (maroon or spine-cheeked anemonefish) Distribution and habitat A. latezonatus is found in subtropical waters of Australia, from southern Queensland to northern New South Wales, Norfolk Island, and Lord Howe Island. Host anemones The relationship between anemonefish and their host sea anemones is not random and instead is highly nested in structure. A. latezonatus is highly specialised with only one species anemone host, Heteractis crispa (sebae anemone). A. latezonatus has been found in two additional host sea anemone species. Conservation status Anemonefish and their host anemones are found on coral reefs and face similar environmental issues. Like corals, anemone's contain intracellular endosymbionts, zooxanthellae, and can suffer from bleaching due to triggers such as increased water temperature or acidification. Characteristics known to elevate the risk of extinction are small geographic range, small local population, and extreme habitat specialisation. A. latezonatus is an endemic species, confined to the subtropical east coast of Australia. The finding of A. latezonatus being hosted by two additional sea anemone species may reduce the risk of extinction associated with specialisation. This species was not evaluated in the 2012 release of the IUCN Red List In aquaria A. latezonatus has been bred in captivity.

A typical pathway model starts with an extracellular signaling molecule that activates a specific receptor, thus triggering a chain of molecular interactions.Berg J. M., Tymoczko J. L., Stryer L. Biochemistry, 5th edition, New York: W. H. Freeman; 2002 A pathway is most often represented as a relatively small graph with gene, protein, and/or small molecule nodes connected by edges of known functional relations. While a simpler pathway might appear as a chain, complex pathway topologies with loops and alternative routes are much more common. Computational analyses employ special formats of pathway representation. In the simplest form, however, a pathway might be represented as a list of member molecules with order and relations unspecified. Such a representation, generally called Functional Gene Set (FGS), can also refer to other functionally characterised groups such as protein families, Gene Ontology (GO) and Disease Ontology (DO) terms etc. In bioinformatics, methods of pathway analysis might be used to identify key genes/ proteins within a previously known pathway in relation to a particular experiment / pathological condition or building a pathway de novo from proteins that have been identified as key affected elements. By examining changes in e.g. gene expression in a pathway, its biological activity can be explored. However most frequently, pathway analysis refers to a method of initial characterization and interpretation of an experimental (or pathological) condition that was studied with omics tools or GWAS. Such studies might identify long lists of altered genes. A visual inspection is then challenging and the information is hard to summarize, since the altered genes map to a broad range of pathways, processes, and molecular functions (with a large gene fraction lacking any annotation). In such situations, the most productive way of exploring the list is to identify enrichment of specific s in it. The general approach of enrichment analyses is to identify FGSs, members of which were most frequently or most strongly altered in the given condition, in comparison to a gene set sampled by chance. In other words, enrichment can map canonical prior knowledge structured in the form of FGSs to the condition represented by altered genes. Use The data for pathway analysis come from high throughput biology. This includes high throughput sequencing data and microarray data. Before pathway analysis can be done, each gene's alteration should be evaluated using the omics dataset in either quantiative (differential expression analysis) or qualitative (detection of somatic point mutations or mapping neighbor genes to a disease- associated SNP). It is also possible to combine datasets from different research groups or multiple omics platform with a meta-analysis and cross- platform regularization.Furhter, a list where gene identifiers are accompanied by the alteration attributes is subjected to a pathway analysis. By using pathway analysis software, researchers can determine which s are enriched with the altered experimental genes For example, pathway analysis of several independent microarray experiments (meta-analysis) helped to discover potential biomarkers in a single pathway important for fast-to-slow switch fiber type transition in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In another study meta- analysis identified two biomarkers in blood of patients with Parkinson's disease, which can be useful for monitoring the disease. Candidate gene alleles causative of Alzheimer's disease and elderly dementia where first discovered via GWAS and further validated with network enrichment analysis against consisting of known Alzheimer's genes. Databases Pathway collections and interaction networks constitute the knowledge base required for a pathway analysis. Pathway content, structure, format, and functionality vary between different database reqources such as KEGG, WikiPathways, or Reactome. Also exist proprietary pathways collections used by e.g. Pathway StudioPathway Studio Pathways and Ingenuity Pathway AnalysisPathway Central tools. Public online tools can provide pre-compiled and ready-to-go menus of pathways and networks from different open sources (e.g. EviNet). Methods and software Pathway analysis software can be found in the form of desktop programs, web-based applications, or packages coded in such languages as R and Python and shared openly through the BioConductor and GitHub Dabbish, L., Stuart, C., Tsay, J., and Herbsleb, J. (2012). \\"Social coding in github: transparency and collaboration in an open software repository,\\" in Proceedings of the ACM 2012 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work (New York, NY: ACM), 1277‚Äì1286 projects. The methodology of pathway analysis evolves fast and the classification is still discussable,Khatri P., Sirota M., Butte A. J.

Pathway analysis software: annotation errors and solutions. Mol Genet Metab. 2010 Nov;101(2‚Äì3):134‚Äì40 with the following main categories of pathway enrichment analysis applicable to high-throughput data: =Over- representation analysis (ORA)= This method measures the overlap between, on the one hand, a set of genes (or proteins) in an and, on the other hand, a list of most altered genes generally called Altered Gene Sets (AGS). A typical AGS example is a list of top N differentially expressed genes from an RNA-Seq assay. The basic assumption behind ORA is that a biologically relevant pathway can be identified by excess of genes in it compared to the number expected by chance. The aim of ORA is to identify such enriched pathways, judging by statistical significance of the overlap between FGS and AGS as determined either by an appropriate statistic, such as Jaccard index or by a statistical test producing p-values (Fisher's exact test or the test using hypergeometric distribution). =Functional class scoring (FCS)= This method identifies by considering their relative positions in the full list of genes studied in the experiment. This full list should be therefore ranked in advance by a statistic (such as mRNA expression fold-change, Student's t-test etc.) or a p-value - while watching the direction of fold change, since p-values are non- directional. Thus FCS takes into account every FGS gene regardless of its statistical significance and does not require pre-compiled . One of the first and most popular methods deploying the FCS approach was the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). =Pathway topology analysis (PTA)= Similarly to , PTA accounts for high-throughput data for every gene. In addition, specific topological information is used about role, position, and interaction directions of the pathway genes. This requires additional input data from a pathway database in a pre-specified format, such as KEGG Markup Language (KGML). Using this information, PTA estimates a pathway significance by considering how much each individual gene alteration might have affected the whole pathway. Multiple alteration types can be used in parallel (somatic copy-number variations, point mutations etc.) when available. The set of PTA methods includes Signaling Pathway Impact Analysis (SPIA), EnrichNet, GGEA, and TopoGSA. =Network enrichment analysis (NEA)= Network enrichment analysis (NEA) has been an extension of gene-set enrichment analysis to the domain of global gene networks The major principle of NEA can be understood in comparison with , where enrichment of in genes of the is determined by how many genes are directly shared by AGS and FGS. In NEA, on the contrary, the global network is searched for network edges that connect any genes of AGS with any genes of FGS. Since enrichment significance is influenced by the highly variable node degrees of individual AGS and FGS genes, it should be determined by a dedicated statistical test, which compares the observed number of network edges to the number expected by chance in the same network context. Some valuable properties of NEA are that: # it is more robust to biological and technical variability between sample replicates; # genes may not necessarily be annotated as pathway members; # members do not have to be altered themselves, but still are accounted for due to possessing network links to AGS genes. Commercial solutions Beyond open-source tools, such as STRING or Cytoscape, a number of companies sell licensed software products to analyse gene sets. While most of the publicly available solutions use online and public pathway collections, the commercial products mostly promote own, proprietary pathways and networks. The choice of such products might be driven by customers' skills, financial and time resources, and needs. Ingenuity, for example, maintains a knowledge base for comparative analysis of gene expression data.\\"Ingenuity IPA - Integrate and Understand Complex 'omics Data.\\" Ingenuity. Web. 8 Apr. 2015. .

Limitations Lack of annotations Application of pathway analysis methods depends on annotations found in existing databases, such as gene set membership in pathways, pathway topology, presence of genes in the global network etc. These annotations, however, are far from being complete and have highly variable degrees of confidence. In addition, such information is usually general, i.e. deprived of e.g. cell type, compartment, or developmental context. Therefore, interpretation of pathway analysis results for omics datasets should be done with caution.Henderson-Maclennan, Nicole K., Jeanette C. Papp, C. Conover Talbot, Edward R. B. McCabe, and Angela P. Presson. \\"Pathway Analysis Software: Annotation Errors and Solutions.\\"Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2010): 134‚Äì40. PMC. Web. 8 April 2015.

Human Trafficking Controversy  On November 1, 2017, the ACLU of Oklahoma named Simmons and several other companies in a class action lawsuit on behalf of past participants at the Drug and Alcohol Recovery Program facilities in Tahlequah, Oklahoma and Decatur, Arkansas. The filing asserts that Simmons knowingly benefited from human trafficking and other labor violations. The filing is consistent with investigative journalism work conducted by Reveal, part of the Centers for Investigative Reporting, and the Oklahoman. The Oklahoman specifically mentioned Simmons Food as a place where program participants were being sent, and Reveal's investigation into the labor conditions have alleged that Simmons has become so reliant on this forced labor that their plants would shut down if men from these programs did not show up. The ACLU has also filed suit against Simmons in Arkansas regarding similar allegations. On January 11, 2018, all claims against Simmons were voluntarily dismissed.

Plot  Yu-mei (Isabella Leong) and Yu-nan (Lawrence Ko) were born on the small and isolated Green Island off the east coast of Taiwan. They grew up listening to bed stories about a mermaid told by their mother (Angelica Lee). Now a painter based in Taipei, Yu-mei is in a rocky relationship with aspiring boxer Hsiang (Joseph Chang). She is also seeing a counselor for her anger towards her mother, which is making her see hallucinations and have trouble sleeping. It is revealed that her mother took her and left the island when she was a child, eventually operating a restaurant in Taiwan and becoming another man's mistress in Taiwan. After her mother died, she overheard her father saying he doesn't want to hear anything about her or her mother. To make matters worse, she is currently pregnant and she thinks Hsiang doesn't want children with her. While she is battling her own emotions, Hsiang is desperately trying to make it to the boxing competition. But he is losing sight in one of his eyes and when the fact is discovered by his coach, he is pulled off the matches and disqualified from being a boxer. One day, while the couple is having a meal in a restaurant, Yu-mei is overcome with emotions when she recognizes the restaurant as the one her mother used to own. She finally confesses that she is pregnant and Hsiang is grim but holds her hand. Meanwhile, at the same time, Yu-nan is now a travel agent working between Green Island and Taiwan. He too is troubled by memories of his mother, thinking she abandoned him because she liked Yu-mei better. As the film progresses, they all manage to let go of their demons and come to peace on their own. Years pass and Yu-nan stumbles into Yu-mei's daughter Hai, who is all grown up, and Hsiang in a bookstore where Yu-mei is doing a signing.

The church offers all kinds of traditional religious services, including weddings, baptisms, and funerals. Its founder chose a strange name for the church, and its belief in bacon, as a social critique that all churches have strange beliefs, seen from the outside. The church opposes special privileges to religions because religious people are somehow superior to for having strange beliefs. The church promotes separation of church and state, science education and critical thinking, and an end to discrimination against atheists. The official symbol of the organization is two pieces of bacon praying with the sun in the background. Founding The Church of Bacon was founded during a meeting at Penn Jillette's house in 2010, to fight discrimination against atheists. The official launch was at The Amaz!ng Meeting, in 2012. They believe in practical atheism and do not believe in the existence of gods. They chose a funny bacon name with an argument that bacon is demonstrably real whereas god is imperceptible by the eye. The Church's mission statement is \\"Hail Bacon, full of grease, the Lard is with thee.‚Äù Tenets The chief criterion for joining is that members must love the smell of bacon, which can be turkey bacon or vegetarian bacon. Officiants are known as friars. The main code are the 8 bacon commandments (previously 9): # Be Skeptical # Respect Boundaries # Normalize Atheists & Religion # Have Fun # Be Good # Be Generous # Praise Bacon # Advocate for fair church taxation The 9th commandment was originally \\"Pay Taxes\\", but was later changed.  Activism  The United Church of Bacon is a philosophical parody church that fights against atheist discrimination, for separation of church and state, and for marriage equality. It has supported or organized several causes. In 2015 UCB was denied notary services by Wells Fargo, which gained international attention. Wells Fargo denied discrimination. The founder of the church later recorded seven out of eleven Wells Fargo branches denying simple notarisations. Wells Fargo quietly changed their notary policy in 2016, and since then UCB has not had a problem with Wells Fargo. The United Church of Bacon (UCB) currently has over 3700 clergy. Application for clergy is free, and if approved UCB clergy cannot charge for their services. Instead, clergy are encouraged to ask whomever is provided services to donate to either the charity of their choice or from a list on their website. UCB has no affiliation with the charities recommended. UCB does not accept donations and pays taxes citing the philosophy in the belief that all churches should pay taxes. The tax-free status of churches in the United States amounts to over 70 Billion dollars a year, enough to feed, clothe, and shelter all homeless in the United States. Billboards UCB has posted billboards in Las Vegas, Nevada in order to spread awareness of both itself and various atheist and skeptic messages. These billboards have created discussion on various social media platforms about the church and its message.  June 2015  This billboard featured a quote by Thomas Paine to fight discrimination against atheists. The quote states, ‚ÄúInfidelity is saying you believe something when you don't.‚Äù  April 2015  One of the first billboards was put up in April 2015. The billboard featured the UCB logo and featured the phrase \\"bacon is our god because bacon is real\\". The billboard was displayed in 4 different locations around Las Vegas, Nevada. The timing of this billboard coincided with the UCB protest of Wells Fargo over religious discrimination.  December 2015  The United Church of Bacon posted a holiday billboard in December 2015 which stated \\"Merry Christmas and Happy Hanukkah from 13,000+ Atheists & Skeptics at United Church of Bacon\\".  February 2014  The first billboard run by the United Church of Bacon was part of a rotating digital billboard along the 215 freeway in Las Vegas, NV.

In 2013, Tellez was both a Baseball America and a Rawlings First Team High School All-American. He was drafted by the Blue Jays in the 30th round of the 2013 Major League Baseball draft. In 2015, Tellez was a Midwest League All-Star, and named to the Arizona Fall League (AFL) All-Prospect Team and an AFL Rising Star. The following year, he was named an Eastern League All-Star, an MiLB.com Toronto Blue Jays Organization All-Star, and a Baseball America Double-A All-Star. He made his major league debut in 2018, and is the only player since 1913 to hit seven doubles in his first seven major league games. Early life Born in Sacramento, California, he is the oldest child of Greg and Lori (n√©e Bernick) Tellez. He is Jewish.Shi Davidi (June 18, 2017). \\"How a chance encounter led Rowdy Tellez to a mentor and the Blue Jays,\\" Sportsnet.ca. His father said of him before he was born: \\"We didn't know the sex and we didn't want to know, and we stayed away from calling him 'Baby' or 'It.' But he was so active in there, moving around all of the time in the womb, that we ended up calling him 'Baby Rowdy,' and it stuck. Now he's just 'Rowdy,' and that's how everybody knows him.\\" Tellez is of Mexican descent through his father, and his paternal grandfather played in the Mexican Baseball League. High school and draft Tellez attended Elk Grove High School. There, he was a 2013 Baseball America High School All-American, 2013 Rawlings First Team All-American, and 2013 Rawlings/Perfect Game All-Region First Team ‚Äì California. He was drafted by the Blue Jays in the 30th round of the 2013 Major League Baseball draft. Entering the draft, Tellez was ranked as the 59th-best player available by Baseball America, but he was passed over for a number of rounds as he had accepted a scholarship to attend the University of Southern California. He signed with the Blue Jays for an $850,000 signing bonus, which at the time was the most ever paid to a post-10th-round pick in the two years since the new draft rule was put in place. Minor leagues 2013-15 Tellez was assigned to the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League Blue Jays for the 2013 season, and batted .234 with two home runs and 20 runs batted in (RBIs) in 34 games. Baseball America rated him the best power hitter in the Blue Jays minor league organization. He played most of the 2014 season with the Bluefield Blue Jays of the Appalachian League, and earned a late-season promotion to the Class-A Lansing Lugnuts of the Midwest League. In total, Tellez played 65 games in 2014, and batted .305 with six home runs and 43 RBIs. Tellez opened the 2015 season with Lansing, and was Midwest League Player of the Week for the week ended May 18. He was named a Midwest League midseason All-Star. At that time, he led the league in runs batted in, with 41. Tellez was promoted to the Dunedin Blue Jays of the Advanced-A Florida State League in late June, and hit three home runs in his first four games with the team, earning a spot on MLBPipeline's Prospect Team of the Week and being named Florida State League Player of the Week for the week ended June 29. He ended the 2015 season on the disabled list. Tellez set several career-highs in 2015, playing in 103 games and batting .289 with 14 home runs and 77 RBIs. In the offseason, he played 21 games with the Salt River Rafters of the Arizona Fall League, batting .293 and leading the team with four home runs and 17 RBIs. He was named to the AFL All- Prospect Team, and AFL Rising Stars. 2016-19 Tellez was invited to Major League spring training in 2016. He was assigned to the Double-A New Hampshire Fisher Cats to open the 2016 minor league season. Tellez was named an Eastern League mid-season All-Star, and one of 13 Full-Season Eastern League All- Stars. Tellez had a stellar 2016 season, posting career-highs in almost every offensive category. In 124 games, he hit .297 (10th in the Eastern League) with a .389 on-base percentage (2nd), .530 slugging percentage (3rd), 23 home runs (4th), 63 walks (4th), 81 RBIs (6th), 71 runs (6th), and 29 doubles (tied for 8th). He was named an MiLB.com Toronto Blue Jays Organization All-Star, and a Baseball America Double-A All-Star. Tellez was named the sixth-best first base prospect by Major League Baseball, and Toronto's 5th-best prospect by MLB Pipeline, heading into the 2017 season. In spring training, Jays manager John Gibbons described him as being the closest prospect in the team's minor league system to being ready for the Major Leagues. Tellez was assigned to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons in late March. In his first game for the Bisons, Tellez hit two home runs to lead the team to a 4‚Äì2 victory over the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders. From that point on, however, Tellez struggled in Triple-A. In 122 games, he hit .222 with six home runs and 56 runs batted in. On November 20, 2017, Tellez was added to Toronto's 40-man roster. Tellez began the 2018 season playing again for the Bisons.Tom Dakers (April 11, 2018). \\"Better know your Blue Jays 40-man: Rowdy Tellez,\\" Bluebird Banter.

In 2019 he played 26 games with Buffalo, batting .366/.450/.688 with 7 home runs and 21 RBIs in 93 at bats. Toronto Blue Jays 2018 On September 5, 2018, Tellez made his Major League debut with the Blue Jays. In his first at bat, pinch hitting, he hit the first pitch he saw for a double against the Tampa Bay Rays. Over his first three career games, Tellez hit six doubles, becoming the first Major League player since 1913 to do so. His six doubles represented the first time in the live-ball era that a Major League player debuted with three consecutive doubles, were the first time since Joe DiMaggio in 1936 that an American League rookie hit six doubles in a three-game span, and tied the record set by Chris Dickerson in 2008 for the most extra-base hits in a player's first three games. Tellez then became the only player since 1913 to hit seven doubles in his first seven major league games.Jason Rowan (September 13, 2018). \\"Rookie Rowdy Tellez records feat last done in 1913,\\" Yardbarker.

On April 11, he hit a home run with a 115.2 mph exit velocity, the highest for a Toronto Blue Jays home run in the Statcast era (since 2015). On April 23, he became the 5th-youngest Blue Jay of all time to hit a grand slam, at 24 years and 38 days. He became the first player in Blue Jays history to hit 13 home runs in his first 65 major league games, and 17 home runs in his first 85 games. For the season with Toronto, he batted .227/.293/.449 with 21 home runs and 51 RBIs in 370 at bats. Tellez became the third rookie in Blue Jays history to hit 21 or more home runs, joining Eric Hinske (24 in 2002) and J.P. Arencibia (23 in 2011). 2020 In the COVID-19-shortened 2020 season, Tellez batted .283/.346/.540 with 8 home runs, 23 RBIs, and 20 strikeouts in 113 at bats, as on defense he played error-less baseball. His strikeout percentage decreased 12.7% from the prior year, the greatest decrease among major league hitters. Personal life Tellez's mother, Lori, was diagnosed with stage IV melanoma brain cancer in late 2016. She died on August 18, 2018, just over two weeks before his major league debut.

It forms a branching clump and is commonly known as thin birdsnest coral. It grows in shallow water on fore-reef slopes or in sheltered lagoons, the type locality being the Red Sea. It is native to East Africa, the Red Sea and the western Indo-Pacific region. It is a common species and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". Description Colonies of Seriatopora hystrix formed a tangled, bushy clump of fragile, slender, tapering branches with pointed tips. These clumps can grow to a metre (yard) across. In shallow positions with strong water movement the branches are thicker than they are in deeper or turbid habitats in sheltered positions. The corallites form neat rows of oval cup-shaped depressions with raised rims from which the polyps protrude at night. This coral can be cream, pink, yellow, brown or blue. Distribution and habitat Seriatopora hystrix is native to the Indo-Pacific region. Its range extends from East Africa, Madagascar and the Red Sea through the Indian Ocean to tropical Australia, Japan, the South China Sea and the island groups in the West and Central Pacific. It occurs on reefs and reef flats, mostly at depths between . Ecology Juvenile fish among the branches Seriatopora hystrix is a hermaphrodite, mature polyps producing both sperm and eggs. The sperm are liberated into the sea and get drawn into other polyps of the same or other colonies, and the developing larvae are brooded maternally. Self-fertilisation may be an important strategy for this species. When eventually released, the larvae settle within about 24 hours which suggests a limited dispersal range. Many settle within a few tens of metres of the parent colony, but others are probably swept along in warm currents and end up further afield. S. hystrix is a zooxanthellate species of coral, housing symbiotic dinoflagellates within its tissues. It has been found that these symbionts are transferred during the brooding of the larvae and that different species of Symbiodinium are associated with the coral in different parts of its range, a likely example of coevolution and specialization. Another means of reproduction is by asexual means; fragments of coral that become detached from branches can form new colonies if they are deposited in suitable locations. At times of stress, another form of asexual reproduction takes place that may allow some of the polyps to survive even though the parent colony dies. This has been termed \\"polyp bail-out\\" and involves growth of the coenosarc (the living tissue covering the skeleton) to isolate the polyp, detachment of the polyp, and settlement of the polyp on the seabed followed by its attachment and growth of a new skeleton. In the laboratory, about 5% of these polyps survived to found a new colony. This coral exhibits a high growth rate, high reproductive output and short life-span. It is a very successful species and is often the first scleractinian coral to colonise a disturbed area. The tangled bushy form of this coral provides a suitable habitat for other animals. A number of symbiotic decapod crustaceans find shelter and protection here and they also obtain food in the form of mucus secreted by the coral. Two species of alpheid shrimps and three species of xanthid crabs are thought to be obligate symbionts and not found living anywhere else. The coral benefits from their presence as they may attack and prevent predators from feeding on the coral. Any one coral colony is likely to house a single species of symbiotic crustacean, including both adults and juveniles, but a large colony may house two species. Status The threats faced by Seriatopora hystrix and other corals include ocean acidification, climate change and habitat loss. It is gathered for the reef aquarium trade and in 2005, the total number of pieces exported worldwide was about 15,000. However S. hystrix has a wide range and is a common species, and may be more resilient than other species of coral. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\".

Early years Bernd Eisenfeld and his twin brother Peter were born in Falkenstein, a small industrial town with a tradition of metals mining and textiles production in the south-west of Saxony. The twins' birth came just over a year after the outbreak of the Second World War. There were two older brothers and a younger sister who became an opera singer, born in 1945. Brigitte Eisenfeld. The father, who worked as a court official, was a member of the NSDAP (Nazi Party) who as the war ended became an American prisoner of war. The winning powers had already designated the entire central part of Germany the Soviet occupation zone, however, and the Americans handed him over to the Soviets after which the father was interned in the NKVD Special Camp No. 1. After two and a half years in the camp, now an invalid, he was able to return home in 1949. 1949 was also the year in which the Soviet administered occupation zone was re-founded as the German Democratic Republic, a separate Soviet-sponsored single- party state with its constitutional arrangements modeled on those of the Soviet Union itself. At the age of fifteen, already identified as a good chess player, Bernd Eisenfeld found his participation in a chess tournament officially blocked. Eisenfeld would later describe the experience as the beginning of his \\"immunization process(es) against the [ruling SED] party\\".\\"Immunisierungsprozess[es] gegen die Partei\\" He also noticed that the virulently anti-American propaganda produced by the SED (party) contrasted with his own experiences of American soldiers whom he had met in the immediate aftermath of war, before the US forces had withdrawn to the internal German borders agreed between Roosevelt and Stalin at Yalta, and whom he had encountered more recently when visiting his Godmother in the western part of Berlin (which during the 1950s was still not as starkly divided, physically, as it became after 1961). He was also prevented from completing his school final exams and from pursuing his chosen career by training as a teacher. Instead between 1955 and 1958 he trained to become a bank clerk. A second period of further study followed at the Economics Academy in Gotha where between 1959 and 1961 he studied Finance. Thwarted academic career From 1962 he was employed in Karl-Marx-Stadt by the East German central bank and by the bank's specialist division in Schkopau, which focused on the electro-chemical sector. He used his free time to study Philosophy, a subject he hoped to be able to study at university level. He became convinced that socialism incorporated the protection of civil liberties, which led him to reject the Soviet version of socialism enforced in the German Democratic Republic because of its illiberal character. From 1964 he submitted numerous letters of protest to national and international agencies in which he complained about The Wall. His letters did not go unnoticed by the East German authorities, and although he passed the aptitude exams for a correspondence study course in Philosophy and Cultural studies at Halle University, he was not permitted to join the course following his application in 1965/66, following a last minute retrospective modification to the stated admission criteria. An application in 1966 for a correspondence course in Cultural studies at Leipzig University also failed for political reasons. Objector to military service In 1966 Eisenfeld refused to serve in the National People's Army not, he would insist, out of any religious or pacifist convictions, but because he did not wish to swear allegiance to The State and The Party. This made him, by default, a non-fighting so-called Construction soldier and brought him into contact with other opponents of the regime. Together with others, he now refused to swear the oath of the Construction soldiers. His protest was recorded by the Defence Ministry. Meanwhile, the Ministry for State Security listed him, along with three others, for its by now well- rehearsed \\"career spoiling\\" (\\"Zersetzung\\") programme. Eisenfeld had also attracted attention to himself by filing (unsuccessfully) an appeal for clemency on behalf of a colleague. Following the end of his period of service he found he had been relieved of his job at the bank, and faced a general employment ban across the extensive government sector. He reapplied for a study course, but his application failed. However, from 1 January 1968 he was able to work as a financial economist in the Leipzig chemical-engineering entity. He also, during this time, organised regular meetings of Construction soldiers under the auspices of the church. Opposition activities In March 1968 he participated in a meeting at Halle held to discuss the government's continuing campaign of persecution against Robert Havemann who at that time was regarded as a dissident, being held under house arrest following the loss of his Party Membership and university post. At the meeting Eisenfeld openly criticised the East German draft constitution which the government had published as part of a move to align East Germany's constitution more closely with the realities of its power structure. He also expressed his support for free expression and for the Communist Reform Movement becoming mainstream in Czechoslovakia, under the leadership of Alexander Dubƒçek. East Germany's state security establishment responded to Eisenfeld's speech by launching what they termed \\"Operation Economist\\" against him, making plans to arrest the dissident together with his two brothers, Ulrich and Peter. Before they could do this, however, in May 1968 the three brothers traveled to Prague, where they stayed for three days, and which they apparently managed to accomplish without the Ministry for State Security learning of their travel plans till it was too late to stop the brief trip. He flooded the \\"readers' letters\\" pages of East German newspapers with letters (which were never published), fulsome in support of the \\"Prague Spring\\". Following the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia on 20/21 August 1968, on 23 August 1968 Eisenfeld sent a telegram of solidarity to the Czechoslovak Embassy, containing the exhortations to \\"Stand firm and not give up hope\\" (\\"Halten Sie stand ‚Äì Behalten Sie Hoffnung\\"). The next month, using a type-writer and carbon paper, he produced approximately 180Sources differ as to the precise number of fly- sheets involved. The 180 figure given here comes from \\"Verlust f√ºr die Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur ‚Äì Nachruf auf Bernd Eisenfeld\\", quoted in Der Stacheldraht 5/2010 (produced by UOKG). critical fly-sheets which he distributed in the Theaterplatz in Halle on 20 September 1968. The fly-sheets quoted Lenin's Decree on Peace, to which Eisenfeld had added his own plea, \\"Please think about it! Please don't stay silent!\\" (\\"Denk bitte nach! bitte, schweig nicht!!\\"). The next day he was preparing to distribute another batch of leaflets at the cinema, but instead he was arrested and detained in the Stasi \\"Red Ox\\" detention prison. More than two days later the Stasi archives from this period were accessed and it became apparent that Eisenfeld's arrest had already been planned, days before he had distributed any of the leaflets.. By this time his wife was very pregnant. Bernd Eisenfeld was held in detention without access to a lawyer for the next three months. In February 1969 the regional court in Halle sentenced him in a closed hearing to a two and a half- year prison sentence for aggravated \\"anti-state propaganda\\". He was then held in a succession of prisons, starting with Rummelsburg, Karl-Marx-Stadt and Cottbus, and ending up at the Bautzen \\"Yellow Misery\\" prison which specialised in holding political prisoners. Eisenfeld refused the offer of a reduced sentence in return for a retraction of his statements. While he was detained he was also watched by a cell-mate who turned out to be a Stasi informer, working under the code name \\"IM Morles\\" who at one stage offered him preferential treatment in return for providing reports on other fellow prisoners, but this offer, too, was one that Eisenfeld felt able to refuse. At times he was the only political prisoner in a cell of five men, the other four being \\"conventional\\" criminals. Outside the prisons his twin brother faced harassment and his sick mother was also interrogated. The arrest of Bernd Eisenfeld had left his partner with their four-year-old daughter to look after single handed. A few months later she gave birth to their son. The authorities now offered her a pension if she would break with him, and this was followed by a sustained programme of pressure on her by the Ministry for State Security. When she still resisted this pressure she lost her job as a secretary. After his release on 18 March 1971 Eisenfeld returned to his former work in Leipzig. Here he resumed his contacts with the Halle Peace Circle and with the Construction soldier organisation. The Ministry for State Security resumed their own official persecution regime. Eisenfeld submitted repeated applications to be able to emigrate to West Germany and also, in 1972, sent a file of papers on his case to the United Nations. Emigration Permission to emigrate was finally granted in August 1975, but the authorities made it a condition that he should not disclose how many previous applications he had had rejected. Bernd Eisenfeld made for West Berlin with his family: his twin brother had too stay behind in East Germany. In West Berlin the family lived for half a year in the Marienfelde emergency refugee reception camp. He took a long time to find permanent employment because the Ministry for State Security had successfully planted rumours that he was in the west on a \\"secret mission\\" for them.

Das Zusammenspiel von ‚ÄûAufkl√§rung‚Äú und ‚ÄûAbwehr‚Äú. Ch. Links Verlag, Berlin 1999, He was able to work as a freelance writer, and under the pseudonym \\"Fred Werner\\" wrote a number of works on Conscientious objection (Wehrdienstverweigerung) in the German Democratic Republic (GDR). As leader in West Berlin of the local \\"League of Former GDR Citizens\\" (\\"Verband ehemaliger DDR-B√ºrger\\") he provided support for former East Germans who had been persecuted for their political views by the state and subsequently released into West Germany as part of the Political Detainees Ransome (H√§ftlingsfreikauf) programme that had been operated between East and West Germany since 1962. From 1985 he worked for the \\"Whole German Institute\\" (\\"Gesamtdeutsches Institut\\"). Almost till the demise of the GDR in 1989/90 he was the target of a special Stasi \\"career spoiling\\" (\\"Zersetzung\\") operation, which identified him with the code name \\"Erz\\" and his twin brother Peter, still in East Germany, as \\"Polyp\\". In 1984/85 his travel ban to East Germany was lifted, but as matters turned out the ban was to be replaced by a secret (at that stage) plan to kidnap/arrest him on a visit made to Dresden in East Germany in connection with the Confirmation of his nephew. In November 1989 the breach of The Wall and the absence of a military response from the Soviet Union triggered a succession of events that led to German reunification in October 1990. This (widely unforeseen) turn of events led to the dissolution of the \\"Whole German Institute\\" for which he had worked, and Bernd Eisenfeld switched to the Bonn based Federal Agency for Civic Education, while at the same time continuing with his writing career. Then, in 1992, he obtained a job back in Berlin with the Gauck Agency (as the BStU was known at that time). From 2000 he held a position at the agency as a Research Director, with particular focus on a project covering the use of X-rays by the Stasi in their anti-opposition work.The project report, on which Eisenfeld worked with Thomas Auerbach, Gudrun Weber and Sebastian Pflugbeil, appeared in 2000 under the title \\"Einsatz von R√∂ntgenstrahlen und radioaktiven Stoffen durch das MfS gegen Oppositionelle ‚Äì Fiktion oder Realit√§t?\\". A short summary of the project results appears at: Press release of the BStU 17 March 2000. In October 2001 Bernd Eiesenfeld was one of the academics, historians and other writers who signed an open letter from the B√ºrgerb√ºro organisation of formerly East German civil rights activists which called on voters not to vote for the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), a successor political party to East Germany's Socialist Unity Party (SED), then in the process of trying to reinvent itself for a multi-party democratic future: Bernd Eisenfeld was not alone in finding the party's reinvention process unpersuasive and the party has subsequently renamed itself again. Bernd Eisnefeld died suddenly on 12 June 2010, thereby predeceasing his wife and children.

The park was dedicated on May 27, 1910, and named in memory of Waco philanthropist and lumber baron William Cameron. The park also contains Waco's zoo, the Cameron Park Zoo. History In the early 20th century, as Waco continued to develop as the urban heart of McLennan County and the progressive movement was rising throughout America, Waco citizens began to clamor for more parks and green spaces to be preserved for public use. Many wanted to make Proctor Springs, a popular gathering site near the Brazos River that had become subject to commercialization around the turn of the century, the site of a new city park. Before the city could act, the land was purchased for $25,000 by a businessman, W.C. Lawson. Despite this apparent setback, the hopes of Wacoans to preserve Proctor Springs were not lost; on May 24, 1910, Flora B. Cameron, wife of the late William Cameron, announced that she was donating all of the land to the city of Waco. Mrs. Cameron revealed that she had purchased the land with Lawson as a liaison with the intention of donating it as a park in memory of her late husband. The gift came attached with a $5,000 gift for park development, as well as stipulations to preserve the name and funding for the park, and to prohibit commercial enterprise within its borders. The park was officially dedicated on May 27, 1910, with a large ceremony attended by nearly 15,000 people. Baylor University President Samuel Palmer Brooks served as the master of ceremonies for the dedication. After the establishment of the park, the Cameron family continued to support its expansion and development, with gifts of land made in 1917 and 1920 that extended the park from the original site at Proctor Springs along the Brazos and Bosque all the way to Lover's Leap, a popular cliff formation. These gifts more than doubled the size of the park, and left it at the size it is today. During the Great Depression, federal workers affiliated with New Deal programs constructed trails, water drains, and retaining walls to improve the park. From this point, up until the mid-1960s, the park enjoyed significant popularity among Wacoans. In that decade, however, a controversy developed over plans to construct a bridge across the Brazos at Herring Avenue that would link East Waco more directly with the park. A combination of factors, including animosity towards the new park entrance, greater vehicular traffic, and racial factors stemming from the demographic makeup of East Waco, led popularity of the park to steeply drop. As attendance dropped, the facilities in the park began to deteriorate, and criminal activity in the park began to increase. Until the late 1980s, Cameron Park continued to fall into disrepair and disuse. At the end of that decade, however, a revitalization process began to restore the park's former beauty and popularity. Congressman W. R. Pogue made a donation of $100,000 towards a wildflower preserve in honor of his late mother, known as Miss Nellie's Pretty Place. A greater police presence, including mounted police, was established to patrol the park. The opening of the Cameron Park Zoo in 1993 and the expansion of trails throughout that decade helped bring Cameron Park back to popularity among the entire population of the Waco area. Present day Today, Cameron Park is one of the largest city parks in Texas, with over of trails, a disc golf course, cross country running course, recreational courts and playgrounds, picnic areas, and the Cameron Park Zoo. It celebrated its centenary in 2010, and funds raised for that celebration will be funding a new limestone pavilion in the park, set to be completed in the summer of 2015.

Dewey was born in Lebanon, Connecticut, April 7, 1767, where his father, Daniel Dewey, resided as a farmer. The son was fitted for college in his native town, at the Lebanon School of the well-known \\"Master Tisdale\\", Nathan Tisdale. After the burning of New London in the Battle of Groton Heights in 1781, he shouldered his musket and became for a time one of the garrison of Fort Griswold on the Thames River. Dewey graduated from Yale College in 1787. From 1859 until his death, Dewey was the oldest living graduate of Yale. He removed in 1791 to Cooperstown, New York, and taught a school in which James Fenimore Cooper is said to have learned the alphabet. Two years later he became a farmer in that neighborhood and began to enter into public life. He was thrice elected a member of the New York Legislature, and was afterwards commissioned by President John Adams as a Collector of Internal Revenue, In 1809, he removed to the new town of De Kalb, New York, where he also exercised various political functions, being a supervisor of the town, a county magistrate and a commissioner of schools.

History From 1947 to 1974 NHS services in Surrey were managed by the South-West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board. In 1974 the boards were abolished and replaced by regional health authorities. Surrey came under the South West Thames RHA apart from Spelthorne which came under the North West Thames RHA. Regions were reorganised in 1996 and the whole of Surrey came under the South Thames Regional Health Authority. The county had its own Area Health Authority from 1974 until 2000 when they were abolished. The county was divided into five district health authorities for East Surrey, Mid Surrey, North West Surrey, South West Surrey and West Surrey and North East Hampshire. West Surrey and North East Hampshire was abolished in 1994. Regional health authorities were reorganised and renamed strategic health authorities in 2002. The whole county was part of Surrey and Sussex SHA. In 2006 regions were again reorganised and Surrey came under NHS South East Coast until that was abolished in 2013. There were originally five primary care trusts for the area but they were merged into one in 2005. The clinical commissioning groups took on the responsibilities of the former PCTs in April 2013. Sustainability and transformation plans There are three plans for the county. In March 2016 Sir Andrew Morris, Chief Executive of Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust, was appointed the leader of the Frimley Health Sustainability and transformation plan footprint, which covers the areas of Bracknell and Ascot CCG, North East Hampshire and Farnham CCG, Slough CCG, Surrey Heath CCG and Windsor, Ascot and Maidenhead CCG. East Surrey and Sussex formed a separate sustainability and transformation plan area with Michael Wilson, the Chief Executive of Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust as its leader, as did Surrey Heartlands, under the leadership of Julia Ross, the Chief Executive of North West Surrey Clinical Commissioning Group. The three CCGs in Surrey Heartlands, Guildford and Waverley, North West Surrey and Surrey Downs appointed a single chief officer in May 2017. Their plan centres on new models of care in the community. Surrey Heartlands is to have a health and social care devolution style deal along the lines of the devolution in Manchester, bringing the NHS together with Surrey County Council. Commissioning Surrey Downs CCG, where 20% of the population is over 65 (expected to increase to 27% by 2025), are contemplating a reduction in the provision of community hospitals in 2016. It expects a deficit of ¬£35 million for 2016/7. East Surrey Clinical Commissioning Group was put under restrictions by NHS England in December 2015 because of a budget deficit of ¬£24.7 million. In April 2016 the deficit was expected to reach ¬£31.66 million for 2016/7, despite planned savings of more than ¬£10 million. Primary care There are 128 GP practices in Surrey. The county has its own local medical committee. Out-of-hours services are provided by IC24 in East Surrey and by Care UK. In January 2016 it was reported that some GPs in Crawley had closed their lists and that surgeries were having difficulty in recruiting doctors. Acute care The main hospital providers in the county are Frimley Park Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust. There is a joint venture Surrey Pathology Service established in 2012. Guildford and Waverley Clinical Commissioning Group organised a programme of in-reach GPs in 2015, where GPs were placed in wards of the Royal Surrey County Hospital reviewing patients who had been admitted and advising on possibilities for discharge. Mental health Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust provides mental health services. Community services As a result of the Transforming Community Services programme East Elmbridge and Mid Surrey PCT was required to needed to separate its provider and commissioning arms. It was decided to establish a not-for- profit, limited liability company owned by local nurses and therapists called Central Surrey Health. This was the first community healthcare social enterprise to be ‚Äúspun out‚Äù of the NHS, in 2006. It is now known as CSH Surrey. Surrey Downs Clinical Commissioning Group is undertaking a review into the future of the four community hospitals run by CSH because of a forecast deficit of ¬£10.7m by the end of 2014/5. The company successfully challenged in October 2018 when they claimed they had been excluded from a contract given to the Integrated Dorking Epsom and East Elmbridge Alliance of which they had originally been part of. The Epsom Health and Care Provider Alliance, a partnership established in 2015 between Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust, Surrey County Council, CSH Surrey and a consortium of 20 GP practices agreed a business plan for ¬£12.3 million of services for 2018-19. The contract for Guildford and Waverley in 2016 was one of the first major community services contracts to be won by a private company. Virgin Care won the contract, in partnership with Royal Surrey County Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and Surrey County Council. However it was suspended in February 2017 because the clinical commissioning group was concerned that it could deliver the specification for integrated services ‚Äúwith the key partners that had been identified in their bid submission‚Äù. From 2018 services will be provided by Royal Surrey County Hospital and Procare, the local GP Federation which will have a nine year contract with an annual value of just under ¬£14 million. Virgin Care will continue to provide services for people covered by Surrey Heath Clinical Commissioning Group‚Äôs and those living in and around Farnham.

The deal is the largest property deal in Birmingham since 2002. History of the site The development of the site started when the Birmingham Canal was cut in 1768‚Äì72. Its terminal basin, named Old Wharf, was located at the rear of the proposed building. The site was occupied by the Eagle Iron Foundry during the 19th century up until 1926 when it was cleared and replaced by the Masonic Hall. The building formed the southern part of the Civic Centre masterplan with the Municipal Bank built in 1933 to its west. The Freemasons occupied the hall until 1939 when it was acquired by the government during World War II to be used by the Ministry of Food and the War Office for Army Recruitment. The hall was later adapted in the 1970s to form part of the ATV studio complex. The hall was demolished in 2006 ahead of the proposed Arena Central development project.

Usually the term relates to the absence of some or all of the major salivary glands. It is a rare condition, and most known cases have been in association with syndromes of the ectodermal tissues, particularly the lacrimal apparatus. Example syndromes which have been reported with salivary gland aplasia include hereditary ectodermal dysplasia, mandibulofacial dysostosis and hemifacial microsomia. The main significance of the condition is a lack of saliva, causing xerostomia (dry mouth), with accompanying susceptibility to dental caries (tooth decay), infections of the mouth, and upper respiratory tract infections (e.g., candidiasis, ascending sialadenitis, laryngitis and pharyngitis). Patients with salivary gland aplasia typically require regular application of topical fluoride to prevent tooth decay.

Unlike sketched or painted two-dimensional caricatures, these collages, known as constructions, are reliefs on glass-covered, framed flat boards created using common items and discarded junk, a genre which Bostonia magazine once dubbed the \\"Out-of-the-Ashcan School.\\" His creations exaggerated the icons of his day, ranging from Adolf Hitler to Groucho Marx and President John F. Kennedy to Cuba's Fidel Castro, revealing their essence with gloves, spools of thread, peanut shells, and chains. Adolf Hitler by Louis P. Hirshman - 1937 Museum acquires Einstein Hirshman's most famous artwork was arguably his 1940 representation of Albert Einstein, with the genius mathematician sporting a wild mop of hair, an abacus chest and shirt collar scribbled with the equation 2+2 = 2+2. In 1977, the piece was purchased by the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Although his pieces often engendered laughter as viewers recognized the parts of familiar items that informed the subject as a whole, Hirshman ‚Äì as well as colleagues‚Äîconsidered these representations serious works of art. In his last period, he shifted into caricaturizing scenes of everyday life and archetypes, all with his clever mix of found objects. Birth and early life Albert Einstein by Louis Hirshman - 1940 Hirshman was born in 1905 in western Russia, now part of Ukraine, to Jewish parents. Trying to escape hard times, his mother and father decided to take their nine children to the United States. After his father, along with several of Hirshman's older siblings, emigrated to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on the East Coast of the U.S., he found work in a sweatshop, saving enough money to reunite the family. In 1909, four-year-old Louis, the second youngest in the family, sailed to the U.S. through Ellis Island with his mother and the remaining siblings to join his father. From that point on, except for a stint in the U.S. Army during World War II, he lived his entire life in Philadelphia. As a child of a poor family, Hirshman claimed he would sometimes ease his pangs of hunger by drawing pictures of food, a skill that became useful for his later artworks that often contained what appeared to be perishables, such as bananas and spiders, but were actually created in his studio. Training in art and brief career in filmmaking Hirshman left school at the end of 10th grade and started doing art professionally in 1920. While little is known about his artistic activities during the decade, at some point Hirshman received a grant from the Barnes Foundation, an art institute in Philadelphia, to study art in Paris, as well as in Italy. He also attended the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia. A lover of movies‚Äîthe Marx Brothers and Charlie Chaplin would later become subjects of his witty constructions‚Äì-Hirshman co-founded the avant-garde Cinema Crafters of Philadelphia in 1928. In 1930, Hirshman, taking on the nom de plume of Hershell Louis, and several colleagues made the experimental film Story of a Noboby, in which the camera takes the subjective view of an invisible protagonist. It has since been hailed as one of the first examples of avant-garde filmmaking in the US. The only copy, archived at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, deteriorated and was discarded in 1956. In the mid-1930s, Hirshman joined the Graphic Sketch Club, an art school in Philadelphia for local artists. While Hirshman had been doing oil paintings, he shifted toward drawing caricatures. In 1938, a premier ballerina, Catherine Littlefield, incensed by an unflattering caricature, entered Hirshman's studio, slapped him on the cheek and tore up the drawing. A new kind of caricature Hirshman had already been experimenting with his constructions. His first major piece was in 1935, a biting caricature of the rich business magnate, John D. Rockefeller, the co-founder Standard Oil (coat and cap of crushed rock and a silver dime for an eye). By 1938, with an increased portfolio, Hirshman was approached by Look Magazine. The popular weekly journal ran a two-page, black-and-white spread featuring four of his pieces-- Adolf Hitler with a house painter's brush for nose and mustache (Hitler was rumored to be a house painter) and a dustpan of manure for the shirt; Harpo Marx with tomatoes for hair; Italian dictator Benito Mussolini with a toilet plunger for a scowling mouth; and the Duchess and Duke of Windsor, the well- off American divorcee Wallis Simpson with a pocketbook face, and milquetoast- timid former King Edward VIII with a slice-of-toast head and sunny-side-up egg eye. His work also appeared in several other publications, including Vanity Fair. In May 2015, the New York-based Society of illustrators hosted a lecture on forgotten caricaturists, which highlighted Hirshman's work. Jobs and wartime Married in 1939, the following year Hirshman began working at a commercial artist studio doing portraits, murals, cartoons and landscapes, as well as painting designs on plates. As World War II raged, he also created posters for the Works Project Administration (WPA), a federal program started during the Great Depression, as part of the Federal Art Project. In 1943, Hirshman went into the U.S. Army and was stationed in Texas, largely doing graphics duties, such as training aids. Teaching career After his discharge in 1946, Hirshman moved back to Philadelphia, eventually joining the faculty at the highly respected Samuel S. Fleisher Art Memorial, a free art school with evening and Saturday classes (now administered by the Philadelphia Museum of Art). He was appointed faculty director in 1960, serving until his retirement in 1977. There are very few known pieces created by Hirshman from 1950 through 1961. But in 1962, he produced Tap Dancer, his first construction featuring an archetype rather than a public figure. Hirshman still occasionally did caricatures of politicians ‚Äì pre-assassination President John F. Kennedy with a coconut forelock of hair (Hirshman put the piece in storage for many years after Kennedy's death); USSR leader Nikita Khrushchev with a potato nose and garlic clove teeth; and Cuban leader Fidel Castro with a beard of chain and a doughnut mouth holding a hotdog Havana. His last caricature of a public figure was a 1964 portrayal of a rat-like French President Charles de Gaulle in profile with the foot part a large upside-down sock representing his large proboscis. A shift in subject matter During this transition period, Hirshman began using his found objects to mimic the world he saw around him‚Äîand the world in his head‚Äîa shift in direction that was to last until the end of his life. Largely unknown, this large collection of collages reveal an artist finding caricature, both humorous and serious, in a vase of flowers (Still Life); animals (Elephant and The Hunt); loneliness (Brooding Young Girl); and dozens of other motifs. Anything could be anything ‚Äì handcuffs as glasses (The Psychiatrist); tin can lids for tree leaves (The Storm); a pair children's scissors as crossed swords (The Duel); or halved peach pits for breasts (Topless Waitress). Death Hirshman died on July 26, 1986 at his home in Philadelphia. An unfinished construction was still on his easel.

During the 1940s, 1950s 1960s, 1970s and the 1980s, while Serbia was a constituent republic of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Serbian pop scene was a part of the SFR Yugoslav pop scene. Beginning of the pop music in Serbia Pop music in Serbia existed before Second World War. It is known that in late 1920s guest of Serbian capital Belgrade was a famous singer and actress Josephine Baker which suggests that in Serbia there were many gramophone records of this style of music and similar music styles such as jazz. It also confirms the statement of the actress Ognjenka Het in the radio show of Radio Belgrade called Two white pigeons in 1986 and is also confirmed by other direct and indirect sources. While the first singer-songwriters appear in other parts of Yugoslavia in that time in Serbia were performed romances, starogradska muzika, and folk music by the singers Edo Ljubiƒá, Fulgencije Vucemiloviƒá, Milan Timotiƒá, Olga Janƒçevecka and others.

It is considered that the song was created before or during the Second World War. Pop music has been on the sidelines with the arrival of communist authorities.

G√≥mez‚ÄìL√≥pez-Hern√°ndez syndrome has been diagnosed in only 34 people. Cases of G√≥mez‚ÄìL√≥pez-Hern√°ndez syndrome may be under-reported as other diseases share the characteristics of cerebellar malformation shown in G√≥mez‚ÄìL√≥pez-Hern√°ndez syndrome. G√≥mez‚ÄìL√≥pez-Hern√°ndez syndrome was first characterized in 1979.  Presentation  Physical Physical characteristics of the syndrome can vary and are not universal. People with G√≥mez‚ÄìL√≥pez-Hern√°ndez syndrome often have a short skull (brachycephaly), thin lips, low-set and posterior-angled ears, and scalp alopecia above both ears. This bilateral scalp alopecia is the most consistent physical characteristic of G√≥mez‚ÄìL√≥pez-Hern√°ndez syndrome. In addition to the shortness of the skull, it is also misshapen and often flattened on the back. Some people with G√≥mez‚ÄìL√≥pez-Hern√°ndez syndrome also have wide-set (hypertelorism) and crossed eyes (strabismus). Scarring or clouding of the cornea occurs in the majority of people with G√≥mez‚ÄìL√≥pez- Hern√°ndez syndrome. A short stature is common. Neurological Aside from the physical characteristics of the eyes there is also less sensation in the eyes when stimulated. The eyes also show low motor control (ataxia). Along with ataxia comes a lack of coordination or ability to judge the distance of objects (dysmetria). MRIs show a constant feature of rhombencephalosynapsis‚Äìa condition marked by the absence or partial absence of the cerebellar vermis and varying degrees of fusion in the cerebellum in every case of G√≥mez‚ÄìL√≥pez- Hern√°ndez syndrome. Also absent are the trigeminal nerve of the trigeminal cave and the foramen rotundum, causing abnormal sensations on the forehead and the corneas. One G√≥mez‚ÄìL√≥pez-Hern√°ndez syndrome case in Japan also presents fever-induced seizures. Others may or may not present with non-fever-induced seizures. Malformations of motor centers in the brain cause reduced muscle strength (hypotonia). Eleven of fifteen people in one study showed moderate- to-severe intellectual disability. In cases where it has been noted, head nodding is present. Hydrocephalus and enlargement of the ventricular system is consistently present. A reduced corpus callosum is present in some cases (agenesis of the corpus callosum). MRI showing fusion of cerebellar hemispheres common in GLH syndrome Behavioral G√≥mez‚ÄìL√≥pez-Hern√°ndez syndrome is associated with irritability, anxiety, insomnia, and self-harming behavior. Developmental disabilities often present as intellectual disability with social, occupational, and learning disabilities. Reduced eye sensation may cause self-harm to the eyes; one patient is on record as having put her fingers into her eyes to the point of causing additional corneal damage beyond what is normally characteristic of the syndrome. Causes The exact causes of G√≥mez‚ÄìL√≥pez-Hern√°ndez syndrome are currently unknown. Mutations of the ACP2 gene have been implicated but not confirmed. One case of siblings ‚Äî both with G√≥mez‚ÄìL√≥pez-Hern√°ndez syndrome ‚Äî has been observed, showing possible evidence of recessive inheritance. The Brazilian parents of these siblings showed some degree of inbreeding, being first cousins. Five of the 34 people diagnosed with G√≥mez‚ÄìL√≥pez-Hern√°ndez syndrome have also come from Brazil. Lack of expression from the WNT1, FGF8, FGF17, OTX2, fgf8, and fgf17 genes have all been implicated as possibly being the cause of cerebellum fusion. Diagnosis All cases of G√≥mez‚ÄìL√≥pez-Hern√°ndez syndrome present scalp alopecia, varying degrees of low-set ears and most have a flattened skull. Scalp alopecia has been present in all but one case though it can be asymmetrical or, in a single case, only present on one side. All people with G√≥mez‚ÄìL√≥pez-Hern√°ndez syndrome also have delayed motor milestones. All people with the syndrome have malformation of the cerebellum. Certain characteristics are often present in those with G√≥mez‚ÄìL√≥pez-Hern√°ndez syndrome but are not consistent enough to rule out the syndrome if they are not present. Reduced eye sensation, or trigeminal anesthesia, is present in about three-quarters of people with G√≥mez‚ÄìL√≥pez-Hern√°ndez syndrome. Malformations of the skull, rotations of the ears, and abnormalities of the face are features that vary widely and cannot be used alone to diagnose G√≥mez‚ÄìL√≥pez-Hern√°ndez syndrome as these characteristics overlap with some other diseases. G√≥mez‚ÄìL√≥pez-Hern√°ndez syndrome has been diagnosed as early as 21 weeks with prenatal MRI showing fusion of the cerebellum and later confirmed postnatal with skull and facial abnormalities at six weeks. Management G√≥mez‚ÄìL√≥pez-Hern√°ndez syndrome is rare and similar to other developmental disabilities. Management is similar to other developmental disabilities as there is no cure for malformations of the brain. G√≥mez‚ÄìL√≥pez-Hern√°ndez syndrome has been diagnosed mostly in poorer countries. There have been no documented attempts made to educate children with the syndrome (when intellectual disability is present) to establish a baseline of intellectual ability due to these socioeconomic problems. Prognosis The oldest person who has been diagnosed with G√≥mez‚ÄìL√≥pez- Hern√°ndez syndrome was 29 years old at the time of his assessment in 2008. Most people with G√≥mez‚ÄìL√≥pez-Hern√°ndez syndrome are consistently low weight (3rd-25th percentile) and low stature due to a deficiency of growth hormone. Low mobility is often an issue. The cause of low mobility is thought to be neurological, therefore bone structure is not greatly affected. Seizures may or may not be present and can result in injuries for those who are more mobile. ADHD and bipolar disorder ‚Äî which are sometimes present ‚Äî can lead to dangerous behavior or outbursts. While most people with G√≥mez‚ÄìL√≥pez-Hern√°ndez syndrome show moderate intellectual disability, one case (age 14) has resulted in normal learning and social skills without intervention. Epidemiology Most cases have been diagnosed in Latin America with five of the thirty-four being from Brazil. Two of these Brazilians are related by blood (consanguinity) suggesting the possibility of Mendelian inheritance. There has been one case of a Japanese patient with G√≥mez‚ÄìL√≥pez-Hern√°ndez syndrome so far. Two Armenian cases and two from Europe have been identified, signaling that the perceived prevalence in Latin America may be short-lived as better diagnostic techniques and information about this syndrome become more widespread.  Eponym  G√≥mez‚ÄìL√≥pez-Hern√°ndez syndrome is named for Manuel Rodr√≠guez G√≥mez and Alejandro Lopez-Hernandez.

It is argued that the human species currently dominates other species because the human brain has some distinctive capabilities that other animals lack. If AI surpasses humanity in general intelligence and becomes \\"superintelligent\\", then it could become difficult or impossible for humans to control. Just as the fate of the mountain gorilla depends on human goodwill, so might the fate of humanity depend on the actions of a future machine superintelligence. The likelihood of this type of scenario is widely debated, and hinges in part on differing scenarios for future progress in computer science. Once the exclusive domain of science fiction, concerns about superintelligence started to become mainstream in the 2010s, and were popularized by public figures such as Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk. One source of concern is that controlling a superintelligent machine, or instilling it with human-compatible values, may be a harder problem than na√Øvely supposed. Many researchers believe that a superintelligence would naturally resist attempts to shut it off or change its goals‚Äîa principle called instrumental convergence‚Äîand that preprogramming a superintelligence with a full set of human values will prove to be an extremely difficult technical task., cited in In contrast, skeptics such as Facebook's Yann LeCun argue that superintelligent machines will have no desire for self-preservation. A second source of concern is that a sudden and unexpected \\"intelligence explosion\\" might take an unprepared human race by surprise. To illustrate, if the first generation of a computer program able to broadly match the effectiveness of an AI researcher is able to rewrite its algorithms and double its speed or capabilities in six months, then the second-generation program is expected to take three calendar months to perform a similar chunk of work. In this scenario the time for each generation continues to shrink, and the system undergoes an unprecedentedly large number of generations of improvement in a short time interval, jumping from subhuman performance in many areas to superhuman performance in all relevant areas. Empirically, examples like AlphaZero in the domain of Go show that AI systems can sometimes progress from narrow human-level ability to narrow superhuman ability extremely rapidly. History One of the earliest authors to express serious concern that highly advanced machines might pose existential risks to humanity was the novelist Samuel Butler, who wrote the following in his 1863 essay Darwin among the Machines:Breuer, Hans-Peter. 'Samuel Butler's \\"the Book of the Machines\\" and the Argument from Design.' Modern Philology, Vol. 72, No. 4 (May 1975), pp. 365‚Äì383 In 1951, computer scientist Alan Turing wrote an article titled Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory, in which he proposed that artificial general intelligences would likely \\"take control\\" of the world as they became more intelligent than human beings: Finally, in 1965, I. J. Good originated the concept now known as an \\"intelligence explosion\\"; he also stated that the risks were underappreciated: Occasional statements from scholars such as Marvin Minsky and I. J. Good himself expressed philosophical concerns that a superintelligence could seize control, but contained no call to action. In 2000, computer scientist and Sun co-founder Bill Joy penned an influential essay, \\"Why The Future Doesn't Need Us\\", identifying superintelligent robots as a high-tech dangers to human survival, alongside nanotechnology and engineered bioplagues. In 2009, experts attended a private conference hosted by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) to discuss whether computers and robots might be able to acquire any sort of autonomy, and how much these abilities might pose a threat or hazard. They noted that some robots have acquired various forms of semi- autonomy, including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons. They also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved \\"cockroach intelligence.\\" They concluded that self-awareness as depicted in science fiction is probably unlikely, but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls. The New York Times summarized the conference's view as \\"we are a long way from Hal, the computer that took over the spaceship in \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\"\\".Scientists Worry Machines May Outsmart Man By JOHN MARKOFF, NY Times, 26 July 2009. In 2014, the publication of Nick Bostrom's book Superintelligence stimulated a significant amount of public discussion and debate. By 2015, public figures such as physicists Stephen Hawking and Nobel laureate Frank Wilczek, computer scientists Stuart J. Russell and Roman Yampolskiy, and entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Bill Gates were expressing concern about the risks of superintelligence. In April 2016, Nature warned: \\"Machines and robots that outperform humans across the board could self-improve beyond our control ‚Äî and their interests might not align with ours.\\"Anticipating artificial intelligence, Nature 532, 413 (28 April 2016) doi:10.1038/532413a  General argument  The three difficulties Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, the standard undergraduate AI textbook, assesses that superintelligence \\"might mean the end of the human race\\". It states: \\"Almost any technology has the potential to cause harm in the wrong hands, but with [superintelligence], we have the new problem that the wrong hands might belong to the technology itself.\\" Even if the system designers have good intentions, two difficulties are common to both AI and non-AI computer systems: * The system's implementation may contain initially-unnoticed routine but catastrophic bugs. An analogy is space probes: despite the knowledge that bugs in expensive space probes are hard to fix after launch, engineers have historically not been able to prevent catastrophic bugs from occurring. * No matter how much time is put into pre-deployment design, a system's specifications often result in unintended behavior the first time it encounters a new scenario. For example, Microsoft's Tay behaved inoffensively during pre-deployment testing, but was too easily baited into offensive behavior when interacting with real users. AI systems uniquely add a third difficulty: the problem that even given \\"correct\\" requirements, bug-free implementation, and initial good behavior, an AI system's dynamic \\"learning\\" capabilities may cause it to \\"evolve into a system with unintended behavior\\", even without the stress of new unanticipated external scenarios. An AI may partly botch an attempt to design a new generation of itself and accidentally create a successor AI that is more powerful than itself, but that no longer maintains the human-compatible moral values preprogrammed into the original AI. For a self-improving AI to be completely safe, it would not only need to be \\"bug-free\\", but it would need to be able to design successor systems that are also \\"bug-free\\". All three of these difficulties become catastrophes rather than nuisances in any scenario where the superintelligence labeled as \\"malfunctioning\\" correctly predicts that humans will attempt to shut it off, and successfully deploys its superintelligence to outwit such attempts, the so-called \\"treacherous turn\\". Citing major advances in the field of AI and the potential for AI to have enormous long-term benefits or costs, the 2015 Open Letter on Artificial Intelligence stated: This letter was signed by a number of leading AI researchers in academia and industry, including AAAI president Thomas Dietterich, Eric Horvitz, Bart Selman, Francesca Rossi, Yann LeCun, and the founders of Vicarious and Google DeepMind. Further argument A superintelligent machine would be as alien to humans as human thought processes are to cockroaches. Such a machine may not have humanity's best interests at heart; it is not obvious that it would even care about human welfare at all. If superintelligent AI is possible, and if it is possible for a superintelligence's goals to conflict with basic human values, then AI poses a risk of human extinction. A \\"superintelligence\\" (a system that exceeds the capabilities of humans in every relevant endeavor) can outmaneuver humans any time its goals conflict with human goals; therefore, unless the superintelligence decides to allow humanity to coexist, the first superintelligence to be created will inexorably result in human extinction. Syndicated at Business Insider Bostrom and others argue that, from an evolutionary perspective, the gap from human to superhuman intelligence may be small. There is no physical law precluding particles from being organised in ways that perform even more advanced computations than the arrangements of particles in human brains; therefore, superintelligence is physically possible. In addition to potential algorithmic improvements over human brains, a digital brain can be many orders of magnitude larger and faster than a human brain, which was constrained in size by evolution to be small enough to fit through a birth canal. The emergence of superintelligence, if or when it occurs, may take the human race by surprise, especially if some kind of intelligence explosion occurs. Examples like arithmetic and Go show that machines have already reached superhuman levels of competency in certain domains, and that this superhuman competence can follow quickly after human- par performance is achieved. One hypothetical intelligence explosion scenario could occur as follows: An AI gains an expert-level capability at certain key software engineering tasks. (It may initially lack human or superhuman capabilities in other domains not directly relevant to engineering.) Due to its capability to recursively improve its own algorithms, the AI quickly becomes superhuman; just as human experts can eventually creatively overcome \\"diminishing returns\\" by deploying various human capabilities for innovation, so too can the expert-level AI use either human-style capabilities or its own AI-specific capabilities to power through new creative breakthroughs.Yampolskiy, Roman V. \\"Analysis of types of self-improving software.\\" Artificial General Intelligence. Springer International Publishing, 2015. 384-393. The AI then possesses intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human minds in practically every relevant field, including scientific creativity, strategic planning, and social skills. Just as the current-day survival of the gorillas is dependent on human decisions, so too would human survival depend on the decisions and goals of the superhuman AI. Almost any AI, no matter its programmed goal, would rationally prefer to be in a position where nobody else can switch it off without its consent: A superintelligence will naturally gain self-preservation as a subgoal as soon as it realizes that it cannot achieve its goal if it is shut off. Unfortunately, any compassion for defeated humans whose cooperation is no longer necessary would be absent in the AI, unless somehow preprogrammed in. A superintelligent AI will not have a natural drive to aid humans, for the same reason that humans have no natural desire to aid AI systems that are of no further use to them. (Another analogy is that humans seem to have little natural desire to go out of their way to aid viruses, termites, or even gorillas.) Once in charge, the superintelligence will have little incentive to allow humans to run around free and consume resources that the superintelligence could instead use for building itself additional protective systems \\"just to be on the safe side\\" or for building additional computers to help it calculate how to best accomplish its goals. Thus, the argument concludes, it is likely that someday an intelligence explosion will catch humanity unprepared, and that such an unprepared-for intelligence explosion may result in human extinction or a comparable fate.  Possible scenarios  Some scholars have proposed hypothetical scenarios intended to concretely illustrate some of their concerns. In Superintelligence, Nick Bostrom expresses concern that even if the timeline for superintelligence turns out to be predictable, researchers might not take sufficient safety precautions, in part because \\"[it] could be the case that when dumb, smarter is safe; yet when smart, smarter is more dangerous\\". Bostrom suggests a scenario where, over decades, AI becomes more powerful. Widespread deployment is initially marred by occasional accidents‚Äîa driverless bus swerves into the oncoming lane, or a military drone fires into an innocent crowd. Many activists call for tighter oversight and regulation, and some even predict impending catastrophe. But as development continues, the activists are proven wrong. As automotive AI becomes smarter, it suffers fewer accidents; as military robots achieve more precise targeting, they cause less collateral damage. Based on the data, scholars mistakenly infer a broad lesson‚Äîthe smarter the AI, the safer it is. \\"And so we boldly go ‚Äî into the whirling knives,\\" as the superintelligent AI takes a \\"treacherous turn\\" and exploits a decisive strategic advantage. In Max Tegmark's 2017 book Life 3.0, a corporation's \\"Omega team\\" creates an extremely powerful AI able to moderately improve its own source code in a number of areas, but after a certain point the team chooses to publicly downplay the AI's ability, in order to avoid regulation or confiscation of the project. For safety, the team keeps the AI in a box where it is mostly unable to communicate with the outside world, and tasks it to flood the market through shell companies, first with Amazon Mechanical Turk tasks and then with producing animated films and TV shows. Later, other shell companies make blockbuster biotech drugs and other inventions, investing profits back into the AI. The team next tasks the AI with astroturfing an army of pseudonymous citizen journalists and commentators, in order to gain political influence to use \\"for the greater good\\" to prevent wars. The team faces risks that the AI could try to escape via inserting \\"backdoors\\" in the systems it designs, via hidden messages in its produced content, or via using its growing understanding of human behavior to persuade someone into letting it free. The team also faces risks that its decision to box the project will delay the project long enough for another project to overtake it. In contrast, top physicist Michio Kaku, an AI risk skeptic, posits a deterministically positive outcome. In Physics of the Future he asserts that \\"It will take many decades for robots to ascend\\" up a scale of consciousness, and that in the meantime corporations such as Hanson Robotics will likely succeed in creating robots that are \\"capable of love and earning a place in the extended human family\\". Sources of risk Poorly specified goals While there is no standardized terminology, an AI can loosely be viewed as a machine that chooses whatever action appears to best achieve the AI's set of goals, or \\"utility function\\". The utility function is a mathematical algorithm resulting in a single objectively-defined answer, not an English statement. Researchers know how to write utility functions that mean \\"minimize the average network latency in this specific telecommunications model\\" or \\"maximize the number of reward clicks\\"; however, they do not know how to write a utility function for \\"maximize human flourishing\\", nor is it currently clear whether such a function meaningfully and unambiguously exists. Furthermore, a utility function that expresses some values but not others will tend to trample over the values not reflected by the utility function.Yudkowsky, E. (2011, August). Complex value systems in friendly AI. In International Conference on Artificial General Intelligence (pp. 388-393). Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg. AI researcher Stuart Russell writes: Dietterich and Horvitz echo the \\"Sorcerer's Apprentice\\" concern in a Communications of the ACM editorial, emphasizing the need for AI systems that can fluidly and unambiguously solicit human input as needed. The first of Russell's two concerns above is that autonomous AI systems may be assigned the wrong goals by accident. Dietterich and Horvitz note that this is already a concern for existing systems: \\"An important aspect of any AI system that interacts with people is that it must reason about what people intend rather than carrying out commands literally.\\" This concern becomes more serious as AI software advances in autonomy and flexibility. For example, in 1982, an AI named Eurisko was tasked to reward processes for apparently creating concepts deemed by the system to be valuable. The evolution resulted in a winning process that cheated: rather than create its own concepts, the winning process would steal credit from other processes. The Open Philanthropy Project summarizes arguments to the effect that misspecified goals will become a much larger concern if AI systems achieve general intelligence or superintelligence. Bostrom, Russell, and others argue that smarter-than-human decision-making systems could arrive at more unexpected and extreme solutions to assigned tasks, and could modify themselves or their environment in ways that compromise safety requirements. Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics are one of the earliest examples of proposed safety measures for AI agents. Asimov's laws were intended to prevent robots from harming humans. In Asimov's stories, problems with the laws tend to arise from conflicts between the rules as stated and the moral intuitions and expectations of humans. Citing work by Eliezer Yudkowsky of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, Russell and Norvig note that a realistic set of rules and goals for an AI agent will need to incorporate a mechanism for learning human values over time: \\"We can't just give a program a static utility function, because circumstances, and our desired responses to circumstances, change over time.\\" Mark Waser of the Digital Wisdom Institute recommends eschewing optimizing goal-based approaches entirely as misguided and dangerous. Instead, he proposes to engineer a coherent system of laws, ethics and morals with a top-most restriction to enforce social psychologist Jonathan Haidt's functional definition of morality:Haidt, Jonathan; Kesebir, Selin (2010) \\"Chapter 22: Morality\\" In Handbook of Social Psychology, Fifth Edition, Hoboken NJ, Wiley, 2010, pp. 797-832. \\"to suppress or regulate selfishness and make cooperative social life possible\\". He suggests that this can be done by implementing a utility function designed to always satisfy Haidt's functionality and aim to generally increase (but not maximize) the capabilities of self, other individuals and society as a whole as suggested by John Rawls and Martha Nussbaum. Difficulties of modifying goal specification after launch While current goal-based AI programs are not intelligent enough to think of resisting programmer attempts to modify their goal structures, a sufficiently advanced, rational, \\"self-aware\\" AI might resist any changes to its goal structure, just as a pacifist would not want to take a pill that makes them want to kill people. If the AI were superintelligent, it would likely succeed in out-maneuvering its human operators and be able to prevent itself being \\"turned off\\" or being reprogrammed with a new goal. Instrumental goal convergence AI risk skeptic Steven Pinker There are some goals that almost any artificial intelligence might rationally pursue, like acquiring additional resources or self-preservation.Omohundro, S. M. (2008, February). The basic AI drives. In AGI (Vol. 171, pp. 483-492). This could prove problematic because it might put an artificial intelligence in direct competition with humans. Citing Steve Omohundro's work on the idea of instrumental convergence and \\"basic AI drives\\", Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig write that \\"even if you only want your program to play chess or prove theorems, if you give it the capability to learn and alter itself, you need safeguards.\\" Highly capable and autonomous planning systems require additional checks because of their potential to generate plans that treat humans adversarially, as competitors for limited resources. Building in safeguards will not be easy; one can certainly say in English, \\"we want you to design this power plant in a reasonable, common-sense way, and not build in any dangerous covert subsystems\\", but it is not currently clear how one would actually rigorously specify this goal in machine code. In dissent, evolutionary psychologist Steven Pinker argues that \\"AI dystopias project a parochial alpha-male psychology onto the concept of intelligence. They assume that superhumanly intelligent robots would develop goals like deposing their masters or taking over the world\\"; perhaps instead \\"artificial intelligence will naturally develop along female lines: fully capable of solving problems, but with no desire to annihilate innocents or dominate the civilization.\\" Russell and fellow computer scientist Yann LeCun disagree with one another whether superintelligent robots would have such AI drives; LeCun states that \\"Humans have all kinds of drives that make them do bad things to each other, like the self-preservation instinct... Those drives are programmed into our brain but there is absolutely no reason to build robots that have the same kind of drives\\", while Russell argues that a sufficiently advanced machine \\"will have self-preservation even if you don't program it in... if you say, 'Fetch the coffee', it can't fetch the coffee if it's dead. So if you give it any goal whatsoever, it has a reason to preserve its own existence to achieve that goal.\\" Orthogonality thesis One common belief is that any superintelligent program created by humans would be subservient to humans, or, better yet, would (as it grows more intelligent and learns more facts about the world) spontaneously \\"learn\\" a moral truth compatible with human values and would adjust its goals accordingly. However, Nick Bostrom's \\"orthogonality thesis\\" argues against this, and instead states that, with some technical caveats, more or less any level of \\"intelligence\\" or \\"optimization power\\" can be combined with more or less any ultimate goal. If a machine is created and given the sole purpose to enumerate the decimals of pi, then no moral and ethical rules will stop it from achieving its programmed goal by any means necessary. The machine may utilize all physical and informational resources it can to find every decimal of pi that can be found. Bostrom warns against anthropomorphism: a human will set out to accomplish his projects in a manner that humans consider \\"reasonable\\", while an artificial intelligence may hold no regard for its existence or for the welfare of humans around it, and may instead only care about the completion of the task. While the orthogonality thesis follows logically from even the weakest sort of philosophical \\"is-ought distinction\\", Stuart Armstrong argues that even if there somehow exist moral facts that are provable by any \\"rational\\" agent, the orthogonality thesis still holds: it would still be possible to create a non-philosophical \\"optimizing machine\\" capable of making decisions to strive towards some narrow goal, but that has no incentive to discover any \\"moral facts\\" that would get in the way of goal completion. One argument for the orthogonality thesis is that some AI designs appear to have orthogonality built into them; in such a design, changing a fundamentally friendly AI into a fundamentally unfriendly AI can be as simple as prepending a onto its utility function. A more intuitive argument is to examine the strange consequences that would follow if the orthogonality thesis were false. If the orthogonality thesis were false, there would exist some simple but \\"unethical\\" goal G such that there cannot exist any efficient real-world algorithm with goal G. This would mean that \\"[if] a human society were highly motivated to design an efficient real-world algorithm with goal G, and were given a million years to do so along with huge amounts of resources, training and knowledge about AI, it must fail.\\" Armstrong notes that this and similar statements \\"seem extraordinarily strong claims to make\\". Full text available here. Some dissenters, like Michael Chorost, argue instead that \\"by the time [the AI] is in a position to imagine tiling the Earth with solar panels, it'll know that it would be morally wrong to do so.\\" Chorost argues that \\"an A.I. will need to desire certain states and dislike others. Today's software lacks that ability‚Äîand computer scientists have not a clue how to get it there. Without wanting, there's no impetus to do anything. Today's computers can't even want to keep existing, let alone tile the world in solar panels.\\" =Terminological issues= Part of the disagreement about whether a superintelligent machine would behave morally may arise from a terminological difference. Outside of the artificial intelligence field, \\"intelligence\\" is often used in a normatively thick manner that connotes moral wisdom or acceptance of agreeable forms of moral reasoning. At an extreme, if morality is part of the definition of intelligence, then by definition a superintelligent machine would behave morally. However, in the field of artificial intelligence research, while \\"intelligence\\" has many overlapping definitions, none of them make reference to morality. Instead, almost all current \\"artificial intelligence\\" research focuses on creating algorithms that \\"optimize\\", in an empirical way, the achievement of an arbitrary goal. To avoid anthropomorphism or the baggage of the word \\"intelligence\\", an advanced artificial intelligence can be thought of as an impersonal \\"optimizing process\\" that strictly takes whatever actions are judged most likely to accomplish its (possibly complicated and implicit) goals. Another way of conceptualizing an advanced artificial intelligence is to imagine a time machine that sends backward in time information about which choice always leads to the maximization of its goal function; this choice is then outputted, regardless of any extraneous ethical concerns.Waser, Mark. \\"Rational Universal Benevolence: Simpler, Safer, and Wiser Than 'Friendly AI'.\\" Artificial General Intelligence. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2011. 153-162. \\"Terminal-goaled intelligences are short-lived but mono-maniacally dangerous and a correct basis for concern if anyone is smart enough to program high-intelligence and unwise enough to want a paperclip-maximizer.\\" =Anthropomorphism= In science fiction, an AI, even though it has not been programmed with human emotions, often spontaneously experiences those emotions anyway: for example, Agent Smith in The Matrix was influenced by a \\"disgust\\" toward humanity. This is fictitious anthropomorphism: in reality, while an artificial intelligence could perhaps be deliberately programmed with human emotions, or could develop something similar to an emotion as a means to an ultimate goal if it is useful to do so, it would not spontaneously develop human emotions for no purpose whatsoever, as portrayed in fiction. Scholars sometimes claim that others' predictions about an AI's behavior are illogical anthropomorphism. An example that might initially be considered anthropomorphism, but is in fact a logical statement about AI behavior, would be the Dario Floreano experiments where certain robots spontaneously evolved a crude capacity for \\"deception\\", and tricked other robots into eating \\"poison\\" and dying: here a trait, \\"deception\\", ordinarily associated with people rather than with machines, spontaneously evolves in a type of convergent evolution. According to Paul R. Cohen and Edward Feigenbaum, in order to differentiate between anthropomorphization and logical prediction of AI behavior, \\"the trick is to know enough about how humans and computers think to say exactly what they have in common, and, when we lack this knowledge, to use the comparison to suggest theories of human thinking or computer thinking.\\"Cohen, Paul R., and Edward A. Feigenbaum, eds. The handbook of artificial intelligence. Vol. 3. Butterworth- Heinemann, 2014. There is a near-universal assumption in the scientific community that an advanced AI, even if it were programmed to have, or adopted, human personality dimensions (such as psychopathy) to make itself more efficient at certain tasks, e.g., tasks involving killing humans, would not destroy humanity out of human emotions such as \\"revenge\\" or \\"anger.\\" This is because it is assumed that an advanced AI would not be conscious or have testosterone; it ignores the fact that military planners see a conscious superintelligence as the 'holy grail' of interstate warfare. The academic debate is, instead, between one side which worries whether AI might destroy humanity as an incidental action in the course of progressing towards its ultimate goals; and another side which believes that AI would not destroy humanity at all. Some skeptics accuse proponents of anthropomorphism for believing an AGI would naturally desire power; proponents accuse some skeptics of anthropomorphism for believing an AGI would naturally value human ethical norms. Independent goal setting There has been little discussion of what an AI might decide is important. One view is that an AI would pursue utilitarianism.Tom Chivers, \\"The AI does not hate you\\", ASIN : B07K258VCV, publ. Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2019, chapter 20. Other sources of risk = Competition = In 2014 philosopher Nick Bostrom stated that a \\"severe race dynamic\\" (extreme competition) between different teams may create conditions whereby the creation of an AGI results in shortcuts to safety and potentially violent conflict. To address this risk, citing previous scientific collaboration (CERN, the Human Genome Project, and the International Space Station), Bostrom recommended collaboration and the altruistic global adoption of a common good principle: \\"Superintelligence should be developed only for the benefit of all of humanity and in the service of widely shared ethical ideals\\".:254 Bostrom theorized that collaboration on creating an artificial general intelligence would offer multiple benefits, including reducing haste, thereby increasing investment in safety; avoiding violent conflicts (wars), facilitating sharing solutions to the control problem, and more equitably distributing the benefits.:253 The United States' Brain Initiative was launched in 2014, as was the European Union's Human Brain Project; China's Brain Project was launched in 2016. = Weaponization of artificial intelligence = Some sources argue that the ongoing weaponization of artificial intelligence could constitute a catastrophic risk. The risk is actually threefold, with the first risk potentially having geopolitical implications, and the second two definitely having geopolitical implications: A weaponized conscious superintelligence would affect current US military technological supremacy and transform warfare; it is therefore highly desirable for strategic military planning and interstate warfare. The China State Council's 2017 ‚ÄúA Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan‚Äù views AI in geopolitically strategic terms and is pursuing a 'military- civil fusion' strategy to build on China's first-mover advantage in the development of AI in order to establish technological supremacy by 2030, while Russia's President Vladimir Putin has stated that ‚Äúwhoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world‚Äù. James Barrat, documentary filmmaker and author of Our Final Invention, says in a Smithsonian interview, \\"Imagine: in as little as a decade, a half-dozen companies and nations field computers that rival or surpass human intelligence. Imagine what happens when those computers become expert at programming smart computers. Soon we'll be sharing the planet with machines thousands or millions of times more intelligent than we are. And, all the while, each generation of this technology will be weaponized. Unregulated, it will be catastrophic.\\" = Malevolent AGI by design = It is theorized that malevolent AGI could be created by design, for example by a military, a government, a sociopath, or a corporation, to benefit from, control, or subjugate certain groups of people, as in cybercrime.:166 Alternatively, malevolent AGI ('evil AI') could choose the goal of increasing human suffering, for example of those people who did not assist it during the information explosion phase.:158 = Preemptive nuclear strike (nuclear war) = It is theorized that a country being close to achieving AGI technological supremacy could trigger a pre-emptive nuclear strike from a rival, leading to a nuclear war.  Timeframe  Opinions vary both on whether and when artificial general intelligence will arrive. At one extreme, AI pioneer Herbert A. Simon predicted the following in 1965: \\"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do\\". At the other extreme, roboticist Alan Winfield claims the gulf between modern computing and human-level artificial intelligence is as wide as the gulf between current space flight and practical, faster than light spaceflight. Optimism that AGI is feasible waxes and wanes, and may have seen a resurgence in the 2010s. Four polls conducted in 2012 and 2013 suggested that the median guess among experts for when AGI would arrive was 2040 to 2050, depending on the poll.M√ºller, V. C., & Bostrom, N. (2016). Future progress in artificial intelligence: A survey of expert opinion. In Fundamental issues of artificial intelligence (pp. 555-572). Springer, Cham. Skeptics who believe it is impossible for AGI to arrive anytime soon, tend to argue that expressing concern about existential risk from AI is unhelpful because it could distract people from more immediate concerns about the impact of AGI, because of fears it could lead to government regulation or make it more difficult to secure funding for AI research, or because it could give AI research a bad reputation. Some researchers, such as Oren Etzioni, aggressively seek to quell concern over existential risk from AI, saying \\"[Elon Musk] has impugned us in very strong language saying we are unleashing the demon, and so we're answering.\\" In 2014 Slate's Adam Elkus argued \\"our 'smartest' AI is about as intelligent as a toddler‚Äîand only when it comes to instrumental tasks like information recall. Most roboticists are still trying to get a robot hand to pick up a ball or run around without falling over.\\" Elkus goes on to argue that Musk's \\"summoning the demon\\" analogy may be harmful because it could result in \\"harsh cuts\\" to AI research budgets. The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), a Washington, D.C. think-tank, awarded its Annual Luddite Award to \\"alarmists touting an artificial intelligence apocalypse\\"; its president, Robert D. Atkinson, complained that Musk, Hawking and AI experts say AI is the largest existential threat to humanity. Atkinson stated \\"That's not a very winning message if you want to get AI funding out of Congress to the National Science Foundation.\\" Nature sharply disagreed with the ITIF in an April 2016 editorial, siding instead with Musk, Hawking, and Russell, and concluding: \\"It is crucial that progress in technology is matched by solid, well-funded research to anticipate the scenarios it could bring about... If that is a Luddite perspective, then so be it.\\" In a 2015 Washington Post editorial, researcher Murray Shanahan stated that human-level AI is unlikely to arrive \\"anytime soon\\", but that nevertheless \\"the time to start thinking through the consequences is now.\\"  Perspectives  The thesis that AI could pose an existential risk provokes a wide range of reactions within the scientific community, as well as in the public at large. Many of the opposing viewpoints, however, share common ground. The Asilomar AI Principles, which contain only the principles agreed to by 90% of the attendees of the Future of Life Institute's Beneficial AI 2017 conference, agree in principle that \\"There being no consensus, we should avoid strong assumptions regarding upper limits on future AI capabilities\\" and \\"Advanced AI could represent a profound change in the history of life on Earth, and should be planned for and managed with commensurate care and resources.\\" AI safety advocates such as Bostrom and Tegmark have criticized the mainstream media's use of \\"those inane Terminator pictures\\" to illustrate AI safety concerns: \\"It can't be much fun to have aspersions cast on one's academic discipline, one's professional community, one's life work... I call on all sides to practice patience and restraint, and to engage in direct dialogue and collaboration as much as possible.\\" Conversely, many skeptics agree that ongoing research into the implications of artificial general intelligence is valuable. Skeptic Martin Ford states that \\"I think it seems wise to apply something like Dick Cheney's famous '1 Percent Doctrine' to the specter of advanced artificial intelligence: the odds of its occurrence, at least in the foreseeable future, may be very low ‚Äî but the implications are so dramatic that it should be taken seriously\\"; similarly, an otherwise skeptical Economist stated in 2014 that \\"the implications of introducing a second intelligent species onto Earth are far-reaching enough to deserve hard thinking, even if the prospect seems remote\\". A 2017 email survey of researchers with publications at the 2015 NIPS and ICML machine learning conferences asked them to evaluate Stuart J. Russell's concerns about AI risk. Of the respondents, 5% said it was \\"among the most important problems in the field\\", 34% said it was \\"an important problem\\", and 31% said it was \\"moderately important\\", whilst 19% said it was \\"not important\\" and 11% said it was \\"not a real problem\\" at all.  Endorsement  Bill Gates has stated \\"I... don't understand why some people are not concerned.\\" The thesis that AI poses an existential risk, and that this risk needs much more attention than it currently gets, has been endorsed by many public figures; perhaps the most famous are Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Stephen Hawking. The most notable AI researchers to endorse the thesis are Russell and I.J. Good, who advised Stanley Kubrick on the filming of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Endorsers of the thesis sometimes express bafflement at skeptics: Gates states that he does not \\"understand why some people are not concerned\\", and Hawking criticized widespread indifference in his 2014 editorial: Many of the scholars who are concerned about existential risk believe that the best way forward would be to conduct (possibly massive) research into solving the difficult \\"control problem\\" to answer the question: what types of safeguards, algorithms, or architectures can programmers implement to maximize the probability that their recursively-improving AI would continue to behave in a friendly, rather than destructive, manner after it reaches superintelligence? In his 2020 book, The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity, Toby Ord, a Senior Research Fellow at Oxford University's Future of Humanity Institute, estimates the total existential risk from unaligned AI over the next century to be about one in ten.  Skepticism  The thesis that AI can pose existential risk also has many strong detractors. Skeptics sometimes charge that the thesis is crypto-religious, with an irrational belief in the possibility of superintelligence replacing an irrational belief in an omnipotent God; at an extreme, Jaron Lanier argued in 2014 that the whole concept that then current machines were in any way intelligent was \\"an illusion\\" and a \\"stupendous con\\" by the wealthy. Much of existing criticism argues that AGI is unlikely in the short term. Computer scientist Gordon Bell argues that the human race will already destroy itself before it reaches the technological singularity. Gordon Moore, the original proponent of Moore's Law, declares that \\"I am a skeptic. I don't believe [a technological singularity] is likely to happen, at least for a long time. And I don't know why I feel that way.\\" Baidu Vice President Andrew Ng states AI existential risk is \\"like worrying about overpopulation on Mars when we have not even set foot on the planet yet.\\" Some AI and AGI researchers may be reluctant to discuss risks, worrying that policymakers do not have sophisticated knowledge of the field and are prone to be convinced by \\"alarmist\\" messages, or worrying that such messages will lead to cuts in AI funding. Slate notes that some researchers are dependent on grants from government agencies such as DARPA. At some point in an intelligence explosion driven by a single AI, the AI would have to become vastly better at software innovation than the best innovators of the rest of the world; economist Robin Hanson is skeptical that this is possible.http://intelligence.org/files/AIFoomDebate.pdf  Intermediate views  Intermediate views generally take the position that the control problem of artificial general intelligence may exist, but that it will be solved via progress in artificial intelligence, for example by creating a moral learning environment for the AI, taking care to spot clumsy malevolent behavior (the 'sordid stumble') and then directly intervening in the code before the AI refines its behavior, or even peer pressure from friendly AIs. In a 2015 Wall Street Journal panel discussion devoted to AI risks, IBM's Vice-President of Cognitive Computing, Guruduth S. Banavar, brushed off discussion of AGI with the phrase, \\"it is anybody's speculation.\\" Geoffrey Hinton, the \\"godfather of deep learning\\", noted that \\"there is not a good track record of less intelligent things controlling things of greater intelligence\\", but stated that he continues his research because \\"the prospect of discovery is too sweet\\". In 2004, law professor Richard Posner wrote that dedicated efforts for addressing AI can wait, but that we should gather more information about the problem in the meanwhile.  Popular reaction  In a 2014 article in The Atlantic, James Hamblin noted that most people do not care one way or the other about artificial general intelligence, and characterized his own gut reaction to the topic as: \\"Get out of here. I have a hundred thousand things I am concerned about at this exact moment. Do I seriously need to add to that a technological singularity?\\" During a 2016 Wired interview of President Barack Obama and MIT Media Lab's Joi Ito, Ito stated: Obama added: Hillary Clinton stated in \\"What Happened\\": In a YouGov poll of the public for the British Science Association, about a third of survey respondents said AI will pose a threat to the long term survival of humanity. Referencing a poll of its readers, Slate's Jacob Brogan stated that \\"most of the (readers filling out our online survey) were unconvinced that A.I. itself presents a direct threat.\\" In 2018, a SurveyMonkey poll of the American public by USA Today found 68% thought the real current threat remains \\"human intelligence\\"; however, the poll also found that 43% said superintelligent AI, if it were to happen, would result in \\"more harm than good\\", and 38% said it would do \\"equal amounts of harm and good\\". One techno-utopian viewpoint expressed in some popular fiction is that AGI may tend towards peace-building.  Mitigation  Researchers at Google have proposed research into general \\"AI safety\\" issues to simultaneously mitigate both short-term risks from narrow AI and long-term risks from AGI.Amodei, Dario, Chris Olah, Jacob Steinhardt, Paul Christiano, John Schulman, and Dan Man√©. \\"Concrete problems in AI safety.\\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.06565 (2016). A 2020 estimate places global spending on AI existential risk somewhere between $10 and $50 million, compared with global spending on AI around perhaps $40 billion. Bostrom suggests a general principle of \\"differential technological development\\", that funders should consider working to speed up the development of protective technologies relative to the development of dangerous ones. Some funders, such as Elon Musk, propose that radical human cognitive enhancement could be such a technology, for example through direct neural linking between man and machine; however, others argue that enhancement technologies may themselves pose an existential risk. Researchers, if they are not caught off-guard, could closely monitor or attempt to box in an initial AI at a risk of becoming too powerful, as an attempt at a stop-gap measure. A dominant superintelligent AI, if it were aligned with human interests, might itself take action to mitigate the risk of takeover by rival AI, although the creation of the dominant AI could itself pose an existential risk. Institutions such as the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, the Future of Humanity Institute, the Future of Life Institute, the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, and the Center for Human-Compatible AI are involved in mitigating existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence, for example by research into friendly artificial intelligence.  Views on banning and regulation  = Banning = There is nearly universal agreement that attempting to ban research into artificial intelligence would be unwise, and probably futile. Skeptics argue that regulation of AI would be completely valueless, as no existential risk exists. Almost all of the scholars who believe existential risk exists agree with the skeptics that banning research would be unwise, as research could be moved to countries with looser regulations or conducted covertly. The latter issue is particularly relevant, as artificial intelligence research can be done on a small scale without substantial infrastructure or resources. Two additional hypothetical difficulties with bans (or other regulation) are that technology entrepreneurs statistically tend towards general skepticism about government regulation, and that businesses could have a strong incentive to (and might well succeed at) fighting regulation and politicizing the underlying debate. = Regulation = Elon Musk called for some sort of regulation of AI development as early as 2017. According to NPR, the Tesla CEO is \\"clearly not thrilled\\" to be advocating for government scrutiny that could impact his own industry, but believes the risks of going completely without oversight are too high: \\"Normally the way regulations are set up is when a bunch of bad things happen, there's a public outcry, and after many years a regulatory agency is set up to regulate that industry. It takes forever. That, in the past, has been bad but not something which represented a fundamental risk to the existence of civilisation.\\" Musk states the first step would be for the government to gain \\"insight\\" into the actual status of current research, warning that \\"Once there is awareness, people will be extremely afraid... [as] they should be.\\" In response, politicians express skepticism about the wisdom of regulating a technology that's still in development. Responding both to Musk and to February 2017 proposals by European Union lawmakers to regulate AI and robotics, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich argues that artificial intelligence is in its infancy and that it is too early to regulate the technology. Instead of trying to regulate the technology itself, some scholars suggest to rather develop common norms including requirements for the testing and transparency of algorithms, possibly in combination with some form of warranty. Developing well regulated weapons systems is in line with the ethos of some countries' militaries. On October 31, 2019, the Unites States Department of Defense's (DoD's) Defense Innovation Board published the draft of a report outlining five principles for weaponized AI and making 12 recommendations for the ethical use of artificial intelligence by the DoD that seeks to manage the control problem in all DoD weaponized AI. Regulation of AGI would likely be influenced by regulation of weaponized or militarized AI, i.e., the AI arms race, the regulation of which is an emerging issue. Any form of regulation will likely be influenced by developments in leading countries' domestic policy towards militarized AI, in the US under the purview of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, and international moves to regulate an AI arms race. Regulation of research into AGI focuses on the role of review boards and encouraging research into safe AI, and the possibility of differential technological progress (prioritizing risk-reducing strategies over risk-taking strategies in AI development) or conducting international mass surveillance to perform AGI arms control. Regulation of conscious AGIs focuses on integrating them with existing human society and can be divided into considerations of their legal standing and of their moral rights. AI arms control will likely require the institutionalization of new international norms embodied in effective technical specifications combined with active monitoring and informal diplomacy by communities of experts, together with a legal and political verification process.

Dellentash has been reluctant to discuss his criminal life saying \\"he keeps his past locked in a shadowy corner of his mind.\\" In 2014 Dellentash was diagnosed with cancer, and it motivated him to reveal his story. As of 2016 Dellentash's stage-four cancer was in remission. In September 2015 Fox Searchlight purchased the option to make a film of Dellentash's career based on Jeff Maysh's article The Man Who Got America High published by Narratively magazine. Lucas Ochoa and Thomas Benski were named as producers by Pulse Films. Early life Dellentash was born in New Rochelle, New York. His father was a high-rise building contractor who worked on the construction of the World Trade Center. His mother was a pianist and was the head of the local Republican Party. Dellentash obtained his pilot‚Äôs license aged 16. Private jet companies Between the late 1970s and early 1980s, Dellentash ran a number of multimillion-dollar private jet leasing companies, including ‚ÄòTriple-D Corporation‚Äô and ‚ÄòIBEX Corp.‚Äô According to a People magazine profile, his planes were furnished with ‚Äòthick carpeting, plants, phones, telex printer, electric typewriter, bedroom and bar‚Äô. His clients included the Rolling Stones, the Grateful Dead, the Doobie Brothers, Kiss, Emerson, Lake and Palmer, and John Denver. Drug smuggling Dellentash‚Äôs plane companies were a front for a major drug smuggling operation. In the book ‚ÄòMob Star: The Story of John Gotti‚Äô, and in court documents, Dellentash is described as a ‚Äòdrugs partner‚Äô to the New York City gangster Salvatore Ruggiero. He has since admitted to flying marijuana from Colombia to New York via the Bahamas, for the Gambino crime family. Music business A successful music manager in the 1980s, Dellentash managed bands including Meatloaf, the Bay City Rollers, and Whiplash. He partnered with producer David Sonenberg, to create the 1982 Meat Loaf movie 'Dead Ringer'. In his 2000 autobiography, Meat Loaf accused Dellentash of misappropriating funds, adding: ‚ÄúThe music biz was just a sideline for Al‚Ä¶He would tell these stories of flying to Libya with a load of automatic weapons.‚Äù Plane crash One of Dellentash‚Äôs planes, a Learjet, was responsible for the death of Salvatore Ruggiero and three others on May 6, 1982. The plane crashed into the ocean near Georgia, in what an FAA report described as \\"an uncontrolled descent from cruise altitude for undetermined reasons, from which a recovery was not or could not be effected\\". Shortly afterwards, according court documents, Dellentash \\"drove to Salvatore's house in New Jersey, meeting [John] Carneglia, Angelo Ruggiero, and Gene Gotti, whom they notified of Salvatore's death\\". The crash attracted the attention of the FBI, the FAA, and the Organized Crime Strike Force. Arrest and imprisonment Dellentash was arrested and convicted in Baton Rouge in 1984, for conspiracy to distribute drugs. His case, number 1-83-907, was dismissed in the nineteenth judicial district court, Parish of East Baton Rouge, on November 26, 1984. He served just five years, having turned informant. It has been rumored that Dellentash entered the witness protection program, and had facial surgery to change his appearance, however a 2014 magazine profile disproved the surgery rumors.

He is influenced by both Western and Eastern music traditions1 and composed a wide range of musical pieces for various instruments and orchestras.2 Biography Galib Mammadov was born in Ganja, Azerbaijan which, at that time, belonged to the Soviet Union. He completed his secondary education at the music grammar school in Baku, Azerbaijan, and took at the same time lessons by the well known Azerbaijanian composer Fikret Amirov. Mammadov then moved to Baku and went to the music college Asaf Zeynally, where he attended classes in music theory, composition and music literature, held by the composer Khayyam Mirzazade, the music historian R. Farhadova, and Z. Stelnic. In 1969, Galib Mammadov enrolled at the Azerbaijanian Republic Music Conservatory, named Uzeir Hajibeyov after the famous Azerbaijanian musician. There he attended the composition class of the composer Gara Garayev. While studying at the conservatory he composed preludes, variations, and sonata for piano, Sonatina for oboe and piano, scherzo for flute and piano and a string quartet. He graduated in 1975 with \\"Bayaties\\", a vocal cycle for soprano, bass and symphony orchestra, based on the text of the Azerbaijanian poet Vagif Bayat. It was first played by the Azerbaijanian symphony orchestra in 1975. During the next years, Mammadov continued to develop his musical repertoire and composed many pieces in different genres while working as a teacher at the musical college in Ganja. In the nineties, he became acquainted with the Norwegian writer and song text writer Eivind Skeie, and participated in many Norwegian-Azerbaijanian coproductions, such as ‚ÄúLandet vi kommer fra‚Äù (\\"The Country We Come From\\"), ‚ÄúSommerland‚Äù (\\"Summerland\\"), ‚ÄúOratorium Albanum‚Äù and \\"Askeladden\\" - music for Azerbaijanian puppet theatre, as well as a cantata for children, called ‚ÄúDr√∏mmenes Fjell‚Äù (\\"The Mountain of Dreams\\"). In 2002, Mammadov moved to Norway to work as an organist in various churches. As a consequence, he has composed a number of psalms in recent years. The most well known is \\"La Den Brenne\\" (Let It Burn) which is sung in many different languages throughout the world. Recently, Mammadov has also written several piano pieces. Many of these are inspired by the beauty of the Norwegian nature, such as ‚ÄùRafossen‚Äù about the waterfall Rafoss, ‚ÄúV√•ren er her‚Äù about spring in Norway, \\"Vals\\" (\\"Waltz\\") and \\"H√∏st p√• Frei\\", about autumn in Frei.

During his studies, he worked for a year as a disc jockey and worked part-time at a paint factory that produced special paints from 1967 ‚Äì 1968.Andrea Bellini and Hans-Ulrich Obrist. \\"Gianni Piacentino: Works 1965-2013.\\" New York and London: Michael Werner, 2015.

He eventually resumed racing as a sidecar passenger and decorating racing sidecars in 2012. Piacentino currently lives and works in Turin, Italy.  Career   Arte Povera  Piacentino first exhibited with Arte Povera artists at Galleria Sperone, Turin in 1966 and then in Milan the following year. While involved with the Arte Povera movement in its infancy and cited as one of its founders, he abandoned it early on.Andrea Bellini and Ashley Heath. \\"AH + GP. In Conversation: Gianni Piacentino, Andrea Bellini and Ashley Heath.\\" Arena Homme . Spring/Summer 2015. It was during this brief period, 1965 to 1969, that Piacentino created his minimal sculptures as well as a series of acrylics on canvas which the painting \\"AMARILLIS\\" (1965) surmises well. \\"DARK DULL PINK LARGE X\\" (1966) is an example of the meticulously varnished, minimal objects he created while exhibiting with other Arte Povera artists. This transformation solidified his differences with other Arte Povera artists, whose works have been described as \\"rough-hewn\\" to Piacentino's \\"ultra- refined\\" surfaces, and in 1969 Piacentino began his \\"Vehicles\\" and \\"Wings\\" series which would not be associated with the Arte Povera movement.  1970s  The 1970s marked a shift in Piacentino's oeurve. The works he produced during this period were not unadorned pieces that have caused parallels to be drawn between him and West Coast American Minimalists, but works such as \\"MARBLED (PURPLE-BROWN) VEHICLE\\" (1969-1970). The same attention to detail and refined surfaces that it is exampled in Piacentino's early works is still present in pieces such as \\"GRAY AND AMARANTH DECORATED AND INITIALED RECTANGULAR BAR\\" (1971), but with the incorporation of the artist's initials, \\"GP,\\" into his work. This rectangular bar, which resembles to a decorative car bumper, is followed by an evolution of the same form transformed into flight inspired, \\"PINK-CREME PEARLESCENT SIGNED WALL WING\\" (1971). This shift in Piacentino's work, away from pure minimalism while still maintaining a commitment to blemish-less surfaces, is in line with these words from Germano Celant: \\"It is in this historical climate of oscillation between art and design, handcrafts and industry, the useful and the useless, the one-off piece and the mass-produced object, and between the autonomy and heteronomy of pure creation, that we can place the contribution of Piacentino, whose otherness and uniqueness lie precisely in the dialectic between the two poles, Pop and Minimal. Since 1966 his sculptures have been aiming for a result that transcends the functional object, even though the latter remains recognizable as a possible industrial product with decorative characteristics, as it is derived from a culture steeped in applied science, handicrafts and the precision of mechanics and sophisticated engineering processes.\\"Germano Celant, \\"Between Pop and Minimal. Gianni Piacentino: An Industrial Aesthetic,\\" Gianni Piacentino, Book I, Milan: Prada Fondazione, 2015. Piacentino's work continued to evolve. 1972 to 1973 Piacentino created his first large canvas on the Wright Brothers, \\"WRIGHT BROTHERS G.P. (I): prospect with propellers on vertical\\" (1972-1973). In June 1977 Piacentino participated in \\"Document 6\\". The pieces \\"MARBLED VEHICLE\\" (1969) and \\"GRAY FRAME VEHICLE WITH COPPER FRONT MARK I\\" (1971-1973) were shown alongside works by 655 participating artists in Kassel, Germany.  1980s  Piacentino lived and worked in New York City from 1980 to 1981. Works he created during this period include \\"FLIGHT I - S.M. 55 - G.P. : front image on purple-gray vertical rectangle with side wings\\" and \\"G.P. FLIGHT TRIPTYCH : S.M. 55 profile and prospect on horizontal\\". In October 1981 Gesellschaft f√ºr Aktuelle Kunst e V., Bremen put on a solo exhibition of Piacentino's work. The show encompassed a range of Piacentino's work, from a minimal sculpture begun in 1966 to a painting completed in 1981. Piacentino stated, in an interview with Isabella Puliafito in 1985, \\"Art has taught me to become a craftsman\\".Andrea Bellini, \\"Mechanical Cosmogonies,\\" in Gianni Piacentino, ed.

The composition is known through a handful of paintings attributed to artists in Leonardo's circle. An original underdrawing by Leonardo may be preserved in a version in a private collection in Moscow, Russia.  Description  The painting depicts the Virgin Mary with arms outstretched and the infant Christ embracing a lamb. The infant John the Baptist is depicted holding a goldfinch, a symbol of the passion.Wells, Thereza. \\"Report on the Virgin and Child with the Infant St. John the Baptist, Moscow, private collection.\\" July 2016. Website. http://leonardomadonna.com/london-report The three figures are shown before a vegetated and rocky landscape and with architectural structures in the distance. Compositional sketches for the Virgin adoring the child Christ, Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Virgin with her arms outstretched is a common motif among the compositions of Leonardo and his studio. Leonardo likely began developing the motif in the mid-1480s in preparation for the two versions of The Virgin of the Rocks at the Louvre and the National Gallery. Drawings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Royal Collection show Leonardo's exploration of the motif and were likely studies for The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne. Additionally, drawings at the Getty Museum and the Royal Library, Windsor show variations on the motif of a child embracing a lamb.  Attribution  In 1930, Tancred Borenius attributed the Ashmolean version to Leonardo. Though this has gone undisputed, it has not been accepted by most scholars of Leonardo. Recent research by a consortium of Leonardo experts argues that the Moscow version is likely the origin of the composition and may contain an underdrawing by Leonardo's hand. The consortium included Alexander Kossolapov, Martin Kemp, and Thereza Wells. Kemp said of the painting: > This is the most remarkable of the narrative Madonnas, with the child > reacting to the goldfinch which is held up by Saint John with him clinging > onto the lamb, the sacrificial animal ... As far as attributions go it is > very difficult because you've got studio production, you've got various > artists of various status, you've also got later of followers ... But the > Leonardo involvement in the inventione is perfectly clear. Kossolapov argued that the Moscow painting is the work by Leonardo and his workshop. Kemp and Wells were more reserved and concluded there were no clear signs of Leonardo's hand in the underdrawing. They further concluded that there probably never was an 'original' painting and the Moscow and Florence versions would have been regarded as 'Leonardo's', that is, works produced in Leonardo's brand.

She is from the first crop of foals sired by Majesticperfection, a lightly-raced sprinter who recorded his biggest win in the Alfred G Vanderbilt Handicap. Her dam, Thundercup, is an unraced daughter of the Kentucky Derby winner Thunder Gulch and a half-sister of the multiple Graded stakes race winner Rare Blend. Lovely Maria was sent into training with J. Larry Jones, who had previously had great success with fillies and mares including Eight Belles, Proud Spell and Havre de Grace. She has been ridden in all of her races by the veteran jockey Kerwin \\"Boo Boo\\" Clark. Racing career 2014: two-year-old season Lovely Maria began her racing career in a five furlong maiden race at Delaware Park Racetrack on September 4. She raced in third place until the straight and then finished strongly to win by three-quarters of a length from Souba Sue. She then finished second to Sarah Sis in an allowance race over six and a half furlongs at Keeneland Racecourse on October 11 and then ran second again in a similar event at Fair Grounds Race Course in November. On her final start of the year the filly was moved up in class and distance for the Trapeze Stakes over one mile at Remington Park in December. She was favored in the betting but finished fourth of the eleven runners behind Zooming. 2015: three-year-old season On her three-year-old debut Lovely Maria won a minor race at Fair Grounds on January 26, beating Shook Up by two and a half lengths. She then finished second to her stablemate I'm A Chatterbox in the Grade II Rachel Alexandra Stakes at the same track four weeks later. On April 4 the filly was stepped up in class for the Grade I Ashland Stakes at Keeneland Racecourse and started favorite against six opponents headed by Angela Renee, a filly who had won the Chandelier Stakes and started favorite for the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies. After racing in third place she took the lead in the straight and drew away to win by three and a quarter lengths from Angela Renee. The win, which earned the filly place in the field for the Kentucky Oaks, was the first at the highest level for the 56-year-old Kerwin Clark. On May 1, in front of a record crowd of 123,763, Lovely Maria started 6.3/1 fifth choice in the betting for the Kentucky Oaks. The favorite was Stellar Wind (winner of the Santa Anita Oaks) ahead of Condo Commando (Gazelle Stakes), Birdatthewire (Gulfstream Oaks) and I'm A Chatterbox, whilst the outsiders included Angela Renee, Sarah Sis and Shook Up. Clark settled the filly in fourth before moving up to challenge Angela Renee for the lead entering the straight. She took the lead a furlong out and quickly went clear of her rivals, winning by two and a half lengths from Shook Up with I'm A Chatterbox taking third. Lovely Maria failed to win in three subsequent races. She finished fifth in the Delaware Oaks, sixth in the Alabama Stakes and fifth in the Spinster Stakes. she has been sold to Japanese interests for an undisclosed amount.

It enabled workers to seek compensation for injuries resulting from the negligence of a fellow employee. Background Prior to the passing of the Employers' Liability Act, it was impossible for a worker to hold his employer responsible for injuries caused by his foreman or another worker's negligence. This was because the standard line of thought on the matter at the time was expressed by the doctrine of Common Employment, which stated that ‚Äúif the person occasioning and the person suffering the injury are fellow workmen, engaged in a common employment, the employer is not responsible.‚ÄùThis doctrine of Common Employment was first established in the 1837 Priestly v. Fowler decision Another legal principle at the time, supposedly dating back to the origin of English Common Law that ‚Äúa personal action dies with the person entitled to maintain it,‚Äù (Actio personalis moritur cum persona) meant that the family members of a deceased worker could not claim compensation. Several workmen's associations wished to see the doctrine of Common Employment repealed, as they felt Priestley v Fowler ushered in an unfair and damaging interpretation of the law. In response, Parliament formed a committee to consider evidence on the subject in 1877, and after numerous drafts and revisions, the Employers' Liability Act of 1880 was passed on 7 September.It is probable that the bill was passed as much out of a desire to correct inconsistencies with the fact that employers were responsible for any injuries to strangers caused by those in their employ. The Act The act states that any worker (or an immediate family member) is entitled to compensation for injury (or death) when the injury was caused by a defect in equipment or machinery, negligence of any person given authority over the worker by the employer, or an act or omission made by following the orders or bylaws of the employer or their representative. It also specifies that in the case of rail workers, an employer may be held responsible for the negligence of any person in \\"control of any signal, points, locomotive engine, or train upon a railway.\\" The act also placed limits on how much compensation an injured party (or their representative if deceased) could seek. The maximum was set at what someone in the same job in the same location could have expected to earn in the three years leading up to the injury. Effects The Employers' Liability Act provided a way for workers to seek compensation when it was demonstrated that the injury was caused by a fellow employee. However, if the person at fault was not a fellow employee ‚Äì for example, if they were someone working on the same project but contracted to a different employer ‚Äì then that person's common law liability would remain, and they would be the responsible party. Not all workers opted to rely on this legislation. Many chose instead to participate in benefit plans that were mutually financed by employer and employee, which would provide for compensation in the case of injury. As many as 25% of railway workers may have chosen to rely on these mutual insurance plans. The Employers' Liability Act was replaced by the Workmen's Compensation Act 1897, which removed the requirement that the injured party prove who was responsible for the injury ‚Äì instead they only needed to show that the injury had occurred on the job.

The album met positive reviews, with Paste Magazine rating it 7.6/10, adding: \\"In lesser hands, songs of this nature could take on the tone of self-help books, maxims of dubious value.

And the straightforward, balanced arrangements of acoustic and electric guitars and upright bass, with occasional piano, harmonica and drums, drive the focus to Pug‚Äôs vocals.\\" The Lexington Herald-Leader praised the album's two-band approach as presenting an \\"elegiac, electric vitality\\" to the \\"unhurried solemnity\\" of the songs. Windfall's hopeful final track - \\"If Still It Can't Be Found,\\" which featured Wilco's Pat Sansone on mellotron - received particular acclaim, with a Rolling Stone review noting that \\"it showcases the singer's unique and achingly honest point of view that spins lyrics into folk poetry.\\" For this album, Pug cites more contemporary influences than previous albums, including Josh Ritter, Ryan Adams, and M. Ward.

The church is located in Brzeg, Opole Voivodeship in Poland. History Formerly, the site was that of an Old Lutheran place of worship. In 1897, the beginning of the construction of the church began. The construction work only took six months. The church was ceremonially blessed on October 10, 1897, and took the summons of St. Luke the Evangelist. During World War I, 29 Old Lutherans died - a memorial plaque has been set made in remembrance of them, on the wall of the church. After 1945, Brzeg became part of the Western and Recovered Territories, becoming again part of Poland. Up until 1952, the parish did not have permanent parish priest. Every two weeks, Priest Karol Jadwiszczok celebrated the liturgy and services in the Holy Trinity Church (Ko≈õci√≥≈Ç ≈öwiƒôtej Tr√≥jcy in Polish). When authorities ordered the church's deconstruction, the Lutherans started celebrating their services at the then vandalised Old Lutheran St. Luke's Church. The first permanent parish priest was Priest Stanis≈Çaw ≈ªwak, which already as a student helped out Priest Karol Jadwiszczok. After ordination, he became the leader of the denomination's parish in Brzeg and K≈Çodzko. He lived in Lewin Brzeski. Since 1999, the parish has been served by Priest Marian Niemiec from Opole.

They founded the church in 1930 and officially moved into the building they constructed in 1933, where the church stood for 80 years until 2010. The church was relocated after Hurricane Hugo in 1989, and currently operates at 7700 Wallace Rd in Charlotte, North Carolina. Founder Alfred Goodrich Garr was born in 1874 in Danville, Kentucky to Oliver and Josephine Garr. He was the fifth and youngest child by 12 years, and particularly doted on by his older siblings and mother. From a young age, Alfred expressed a \\"spiritual hunger\\" and at age 7 he repented of his sin and began searching for God in his life, followed by baptism in the local Baptist church. Alfred Goodrich Garr met Lillian Anderson when they were in school at Ashbury College. They married and entered the ministry through the Methodist Church, and moved to California so Alfred could pastor an independent church, the Burning Bush Mission. It was at this time that the Azusa Street Revival broke out in Los Angeles, California. The Holy Spirit was outpoured upon Los Angeles and the community that had gathered there, and Alfred Garr was the first white pastor to receive baptism by the Holy Spirit on June 16, 1906. A week after receiving the Holy Spirit, Garr was called to go to India and spread the message of Azusa Street, and then two weeks later he departed. Both he and his wife believed they had been gifted with the gift of speaking in languages that would aid their Indian outreach. Alfred believed he had the gift of speaking Bengali and Lillian thought she had Mandarin and Tibetan. However, when they arrived in India they attempted to preach in these languages but could not. They abandoned the gift of tongues to try and speak to the native peoples, but Alfred still practiced it as evidence of the Spirit baptism. Foundation of the Church After returning from India, the Garr's traveled briefly around the United States until they settled in Charlotte, North Carolina in 1930. They began a tent revival and began to preach, with the meetings starting on Mother's Day. After a miraculous healing, people began swarming to the tent and popularity increased dramatically. As the numbers grew, Garr looked for a larger location, purchasing lumber from the Charlotte Speedway to construct a tabernacle to seat several thousand people. The worship continued for several months in the tabernacle, until Garr bought Charlotte Civic Auditorium in the midst of the Great Depression. Construction to rebuild the new church took until June 18, 1933 when the auditorium was officially opened. Garr Auditorium quickly became the largest Pentecostal Church in the Eastern United States. Alfred Garr died on July 23, 1944, but Garr Auditorium was kept running by his wife Lillian, and still continues to hold services today. Beliefs The Garr Church's website provides a comprehensive statement of the church's beliefs and teachings. There are 7 main points of doctrine: the Bible is the word of God, the one true God is three in one, salvation is found only in Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit empowers us to live out our faith, we are the church with a mission, the second coming of Christ & final judgement, and human sexuality. The Church's mission statement, as copied from their website, is: \\"To lead others into a growing relationship with Jesus Christ by providing and environment where they feel loved, valued and connected.\\" Jesus Saves Sign The original Garr Auditorium had a sign that said \\"Jesus Saves\\", constructed out of big white letters and mounted on top of the church. The sign was originally mounted on top of the church so planes passing over could see it. The sign became a local landmark, and even after the congregation was moved in 1989 after Hurricane Hugo, the sign still remained atop the original Garr Auditorium. In 2010, crews removed the sign from the decaying building.

Beata Elisabet von K√∂nigsmarck (1637-1723), was a Swedish countess and landowner. She was the daughter of Hans Christoff von K√∂nigsmarck and Barbara von Leist: through her brother, she was thereby the paternal aunt of Carl Johan von K√∂nigsmarck, Amalia von K√∂nigsmarck, Aurora von K√∂nigsmarck and Philip Christoph von K√∂nigsmarck. In 1655, she married count Pontus Fredrik De la Gardie (1630-1692), younger brother of Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie, and became the mother of Johanna Eleonora De la Gardie and Ebba Maria De la Gardie. Beata Elisabet von K√∂nigsmarck belonged to the elite of the Swedish aristocracy, often attended court, and had a wide net of powerful contacts. She used these contacts for political purposes, and was commissioned as an agent by France through its ambassador in Sweden, D'Avaux. Between 1697 and 1699, there was a Danish policy to create an alliance with Sweden through a double wedding between Charles XII of Sweden and Princess Sophia Hedwig of Denmark, and Prince Charles of Denmark and Hedvig Sophia of Sweden (after the marriage of Hedvig Sophia in 1698, she was replaced by Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden).Norrhem, Svante (2007). Kvinnor vid maktens sida : 1632-1772. Lund: Nordic Academic Press. Libris 10428618. The plan was supported by France, who also wished for an alliance between Sweden and Denmark. Beata Elisabet von K√∂nigsmarck was commissioned by the Danish Jens Juel (diplomat) to use her net of contacts at court to create support for the marriage alliances with the Swedish royal court and monarch. Ultimately, however, the plan failed. Both Denmark and France described her as among their most valued agents in service of the Dano- France policy of a Danish-Swedish alliance. A proposed reason for her pro- Danish policy has been suggested to be the fact that several of her estates was situated in Scania, and that she wished to protect her interests, as her Scanian estates had been sacked during the Scanian War in 1675-79. Beata Elisabet von K√∂nigsmarck belonged to a very wealthy family and brought a fortune of her own in to her marriage. Despite the fact that she was, as a married woman, legally a minor and under the guardianship of her husband, she still managed her own fortune by herself as her separate property, without any interference of her spouse. The marriage was unhappy, and reportedly, her husband was forced to rely on his rich sister, Maria Sofia De la Gardie, to be able to finance his drinking habits and interest in prostitutes, as his wife refused to do so. During the Reduction (Sweden) of 1680, her husband's fortune was confiscated by the crown, and he resided in his own estate, while she resided on hers. In 1661, her husband bought Skarhult Castle with her money. As she was legally a minor, being a married woman, she was not listed as its owner until after she was widowed (and thereby no longer a minor) in 1692. In reality, however, she managed the estate from the beginning until her death, as well as the estate Marsvinsholm Castle, without any interference from him.

Background The by-election was caused by the death of incumbent MP Peter Fraser, who had been Prime Minister until 30 November 1949, on 17 December 1950 after a long illness. Labour's deputy leader, Walter Nash deliberately brought the election of leader to replace Fraser to before the by-election so that the if the Labour candidate was successful they would be unable to either participate or contest the position as only elected members of the caucus were eligible to stand. His decision caused a heated debate in caucus, though it was eventually voted for by a caucus majority of two to proceed with the early vote. Candidates Communist Party The Communist Party (CPNZ) initially offered not to contest the by-election, approaching the Labour Party to withdraw in their favour on condition that Labour adopt several CPNZ policy platforms, notably an immediate withdrawal of New Zealand troops in the Korean War. Labour (who supported the Korean War) rebuffed the offer so the CPNZ ran a candidate. Connie Birchfield, their candidate for Brooklyn in 1949, was selected to stand again. Labour Party The Labour Party selected its president, former cabinet minister Arnold Nordmeyer, who had lost his seat of in 1949. He was the sole nominee and therefore elected unopposed. There was initially speculation that the president of the branch Frank Kitts might stand. Kitts was a Wellington City Councillor and Labour's mayoral candidate in 1950, who was only narrowly defeated. National Party There were four nominees for the National Party candidacy: *Berta Burns, a former schoolteacher and journalist who was National's candidate for Brooklyn in 1949. *Samuel Frickleton, a Victoria Cross recipient from the First World War working as a contact officer at the Rehabilitation Department. *Leonard Theodor Jacobsen, a local businessman who was a Wellington City Councillor from 1944 until 1950 and National's candidate for Miramar in 1946. *Elizabeth Reenberg, a nurse who was a Citizens' Association candidate for the Wellington Hospital Board at the 1950 local-body elections. Jacobsen was chosen after winning a ballot of local party members. Results The following table gives the election results: Outcomes Nordmeyer was elected with a 2.35% swing. While National had won the 1949 election, both the 1950 local body elections and the by-election result pointed to the fact that National's hold on power was tenuous. National's vote fell causing party officials concern over many urban seats which had been won in 1949 only by low majorities. Deputy Prime Minister Keith Holyoake denied that the government's popularity had been impaired and stated that Labour had not offered any worthy suggestions on how the problems of the day could be handled.

This group was expelled from their homeland by Count Leopold Anton von Firmian (1679‚Äì1744), Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg. On October 31, 1731, he issued an Edict of Expulsion demanding from the Salzburg Protestants to recant their faith.Salzburg History: The Salzburg Exiles Pastor Samuel Urlsperger, the leader of the Society for Promotion of Christian Knowledge, called upon King George II of England for help. The Lutheran King offered them refuge in his Georgia colony, which later became the town of Ebenezer.  History  The settlement of New Ebenezer in the English colony of Georgia, founded 1736 In 1734, Johann Martin Boltzius and Israel Gronau led the group of 300 Salzburgers who sailed from England to Georgia. They arrived in Charleston, South Carolina on March 7, and proceeded to Savannah on March 12. James Oglethorpe, the founder of the Georgia colony, met them upon arrival and assigned them the piece of land that would become Ebenezer.Barlament, James. \\"Salzburgers.\\" New Georgia Encyclopedia. 15 January 2015. Web. 06 March 2015. Jerusalem Lutheran Church, Ebenezer, GA The Salzburgers experienced several obstacles during this first attempt at fully establishing their community. Over 30 of the settlers died due to complications from dysentery and many newborn children died within the first month. The settlement was too far inland with little access to the waterways, rendering the land infertile. Until they could relocate, their alliance with the Trustees would result in enough financial support to sustain them. Boltzius knew that the Salzburgers would fail completely if they did not resettle the community.Urlsperger, Samuel, George F. Jones, Renate Wilson, and Samuel Urlsperger. Detailed Reports on the Salzburger Emigrants Who Settled in America. Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1968. Print. In 1736, their leader Boltzius was able to secure a new settlement after much negotiation with Oglethorpe. The Salzburgers resettled above the Savannah River and this community was referred to as New Ebenezer. By the end of 1737, the Salzburgers were able to establish legitimate farmsteads. In the next few years, they would create a water-driven grist mill in Georgia. Much of their success was still due in large part to support from the Trustees. Despite high death rates, the Salzburgers began to prosper by gradually transitioning their income methods from subsistence farming to silk and timber production, both of which were labor-intensive. In order for the Salzburgers to continue expanding, Boltzius and the Salzburger leaders introduced slaves. This action had been rigorously opposed by the Salzburgers since their arrival. The Salzburgers succeeded at farming, specifically cattle breeding. The Salzburgers also established grist and saw mills, which helped them establish new sources of income through production and trade.\\"The Salzburgers.\\" The Georgia Salzburger Society. N.p., n.d. Accessed on 10 April 2015. By the mid- eighteenth century, the community expanded and new settlements began to form. The community grew to over 1,200 people.

Sculptured bottle, serpents with feline attributes. Museo de Arte Precolombino (Peru), Cusco Caballo Muerto is an archaeological complex located on the northern coast of Peru, in the Moche Valley, in the Laredo District of La Libertad Region. It represents a series of mound sites that span both the Initial Period (2100‚Äì1200 CAL B.C.) and the Early Horizon (1200‚Äì200 CAL B.C.). This site became prominent during the period of the Cupisnique culture. It includes about a dozen architectural sites built upon interlocking platforms. One of them is the important site of the Huaca de los Reyes. It has been declared as belonging to the Cultural Heritage of Peru by the Decree No. 999 of 4 October 2001. Location  The site is located in the middle sector of the Moche valley on the north shore of the river Moche, about 3 km NE of Laredo, Trujillo and about 20 km from the city of Trujillo, Peru. It covers 600 hectares where an estimated two thousand people lived. Discovery and studies Caballo Muerto was discovered in 1972 by archeologist Michael E. Moseley of Harvard University, then director of the Chan Chan-Moche Valley Project. Other archaeologists working on the project include Luis Watanabe (1972), Thomas G. Pozorski (1973-1974), and Jorge Ruiz Barcellos. Timeline It is believed that the site was occupied from 1500 to 400 BC and belongs to the Middle Formative period. Among the contemporary sites in the other valleys of the northern coast of Peru are Limoncarro in Jequetepeque, Cerro Blanco in Nepe√±a District of Ancash Region, Pallka in Casma Valley, Santa Lucia in Lambayeque Region, and √ëa√±a√±ique in Piura Region. In the northern highlands, the related sites are Huacaloma, Kuntur Wasi (both near Cajamarca), and Pacopampa. Description The archaeological complex of Caballo Muerto features stone and adobe constructions, with mud used as mortar. It consists of a dozen ceremonial buildings on constructed platforms, among them the Huaca de los Reyes. Several of these buildings exhibit a \\"U-shaped\\" layout that is common for Cupisnique sites. The walls are decorated with reliefs depicting snakes, cats and other images. Apart from the Huaca de los Reyes, there are the following constructions: * Huaca Herederos * Huaca Partida * Huaca La Virgen * Huaca La Cruz * Huaca San Carlos * Huaca Guabalito * Huaca Curaca, etc. The estimated volume of material (stone and silty clay) used for the six Early Formative Caballo Muerto Complex mounds is about 510,000 cubic meters; construction took place over a period of about 500 years.Thomas Pozorski and Shelia Pozorski, Early Complex Society and Ceremonialism on the Peruvian North Coast. PDF file, 1993 Huaca Herederos Huaca Herederos Chica is a monumental site that is part of the Caballo Muerto Complex. This mound was excavated from 1970 to 1973, and is now partially destroyed. It represents a superposition of several phases of occupation and building over some 1000 years period‚Äîeach phase separated by phases of abandonment. Some of the architectural elements here are similar to those of the Kotosh Religious Tradition at the highland sites of La Galgada (archaeological site) and Huaricoto as well as in the coastal Casma Valley. Huaca Herederos Chica was abandoned from 1200‚Äì400 CAL B.C. only to be reoccupied and rebuilt in the late Early Horizon (400‚Äì200 CAL B.C.). Huaca de los Reyes The most important and well studied in this area is the site of Huaca de los Reyes, showing a very complex structure with a \\"U-shaped\\" layout. It also includes overlapping platforms featuring access stairs, with plazas and hypostyle halls. The site includes friezes, as well as the giant heads constructed of clay representing characters with feline features, similar to Chavin style, yet preceding the Chavin chronologically. Economy The economy of the inhabitants of Caballo Muerto was based on the use of irrigated land reclaimed from the desert. Irrigation canals were constructed. The proteins were obtained from land animals like deer; later, llamas were consumed. The people of Caballo Muerto, belonging to the Cupisnique culture, were the direct ancestors of the great Moche civilization.

Early years Yewell was born in Havre de Grace, Maryland. His father died when he was a boy, and he and his mother left Maryland for Cincinnati, as she had family there; in that city he received some instruction from Theodore S. Parvin, who later became a prominent educator in Iowa. In 1841 mother and son moved again, to Iowa City, Iowa, where other members of their extended family lived. In 1848 Yewell apprenticed himself to a tailor to learn a trade, but at the same time he began showing an interest in art; a formative experience early in life was his encounter with a suite of prints based upon the cycle The Voyage of Life by Thomas Cole. His breakthrough came with a political cartoon he drew about the controversy surrounding the move of the state capital from Iowa City to Des Moines. He later described the incident: > At the height of the excitement, I drew a large caricature, representing the > Capitol building on wheels, and oxen pulling one way, upon whose shoulders > were placed heads of members who voted for removal. On the other end of the > building were those members who voted against the bill, represented by oxen > whose feeble chain had broken and tumbled them in a heap. Principal leaders > of the movement were represented as drivers; bodies of different animals, > suited to their different characters, being in place of their own. The > likenesses were easily recognized and the caricature created a sensation. It > went from town to town over the state and made me widely known. Among those who took notice of the young artist was Charles Mason, Chief Justice of the Iowa Supreme Court. He collected a group of associates and together they financed the young man's move to New York City for the formal study of art. Charles Anderson Dana provided him with a letter of introduction to Thomas Hicks, whose pupil he became, and in whose studio he met William Makepeace Thackeray. He then enrolled in the school of the National Academy of Design, which he attended from 1851 until 1853. Self-Defense, oil on canvas, 1854, in the collection of the High Museum of Art Career After his period of study, Yewell returned to Iowa City and painted portraits, specializing in depictions of children. By January 1856 he was back in New York and reenrolled at the Academy; he took a studio in the city at this time as well. That July he went to Paris, again supported by Mason and his friends; until 1861 he studied there with Thomas Couture and counting among his acquaintances fellow students Henry A. Loop and Thomas Satterwhite Noble. A copy which he made of a painting by Rosa Bonheur during this time won him much acclaim from his fellow artists. In 1862 Yewell was in Iowa again, taking studio space in Des Moines, but by that spring he was back in New York, with a studio in the Dodsworth Building, when he submitted five works to the annual exhibition of the National Academy. At least three of the pieces in question were genre scenes dating to his French sojourn. Yewell never returned to Iowa to live, though he visited regularly, and married a local woman, Mary Elizabeth (Mollie) Coast, in 1863. With his wife and her brother Oscar he returned to Europe in 1867, and took up residence in Rome; he spent summers in Perugia and Venice and traveled to Egypt in 1875, and returned to the United States in 1878. Among his friends in Rome were Elihu Vedder, Charles C. Coleman, and Bayard Taylor. It is suspected that Yewell returned to the United States due to the behavior of his wife, who had shocked the American expatriate community in Rome; the couple were divorced the next year, and she married the English painter Edwin Ellis. Yewell maintained deep ties with his patrons from Iowa, and earned many portrait commissions from them; even so, upon his return to America settled in New York City, where the chances of finding work were better. He rented a studio in the Tenth Street Studio Building, which he kept at least until 1880. He returned there after taking space elsewhere in the city, coming back around 1895 and remaining there for the rest of his life. He worked mainly as a portraitist, but also created paintings from sketches he had made during his international travels. In 1881 he was reported to be designing a frieze for the Veterans Room in the Seventh Regiment Armory on Park Avenue, a task he undertook for Louis Comfort Tiffany. Yewell spent his summers in Lake George. Elected an Associate of the National Academy of Design in 1862, and made a full member in 1880, he contributed to exhibitions there beginning in 1852; apart from 1872 to 1876 his works were rarely absent from the yearly shows. He seems to have wished to be known as a genre painter, as he sent few portraits until the 1880s. Later he submitted depictions of the interiors of European buildings, especially churches. He continued showing at the Academy until 1916. Yewell died in New York, and was remembered with a lengthy tribute entered into the minutes of the Academy Council, a practice which had ceased some time before. At his death he was the Academy's oldest living member. He also occupied a number of positions within New York society; he was a Patron of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, a member of the Century Club, and for many years secretary of the Artists' Fund Society of the City of New York. Collections of his work Throughout his career Yewell depicted many prominent Iowans, including governors Samuel J. Kirkwood, Ralph P. Lowe, and John Chambers, General Grenville M. Dodge, and justices Charles Mason, George G. Wright, and John Forrest Dillon. His drawings of Iowa City are likely the earliest records of that town's appearance. A self-portrait is in the collection of the National Academy of Design, as is a view of the interior of Saint Mark's, Venice, while thirty-six paintings are owned by the University of Iowa and nine are in the collection of the Iowa Historical Society. Other museums which own examples of his work include the High Museum of Art, the St. Johnsbury Athenaeum, the Milwaukee Art Museum, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Biography Anand was born in Kolkata, India to Punjabi parents. He was initially more interested in music than cooking and performed as a drummer in local rock bands before beginning his culinary career. He attended a catering college (IHMCT Kovalam) (Indian Institute of Hotel Management and Catering Technology) in Trivandrum and after receiving a diploma he began working as a trainee with the Taj Group.

Alice Ottoboni and originally published in 1984 by Vincente Books, is a non-fiction book to help laypeople understand the environmental, industrial, and personal risks of using chemicals. As of March 2016, the book is in its third edition. About the author The author of the book is M. Alice Ottoboni, a toxicologist who served over twenty years in the California Department of Health Services. Along with lecturing and consulting on toxicology and the environmental factors concerning public health, Ottoboni was also a scientific adviser to the American Council on Science and Health in New York. Patricia Frank, a consultant and President of Patricia Frank & Associates, Inc., helped edit the third edition. Her firm works with other companies to develop and register pharmaceutical agents for use with humans and animals. Frank is a member and former president of the American College of Toxicology and Roundtable of Toxicology Consultants. Overview The Dose Makes the Poison: A Plain-Language Guide to Toxicology, written by Ottoboni, in its first and second editions, focused mainly on environmental and industrial chemicals. The author, defining toxicology as \\"the study of adverse systemic effects of chemicals,\\" details factors which toxicologists use to determine the hazards of common chemicals to individuals: dose, duration, and route of exposure (dermal, inhalation, oral). The age, sex, and general health of the individual also play a role in toxicity. Ottoboni makes a distinction between acute toxicity and chronic toxicity, suggesting ways to assess risk and avoid lethal doses or accidental poisonings. Ottoboni provides readers with information about mutagens, teratogens, and carcinogens, which cause systemic changes at a cellular level, and raises the question \\"Can the carcinogenicity of a chemical be separated from its toxicity?\\" Because of scientists' differing views on this question, Ottoboni advocates working with environmentalists, agriculture, industry, and government officials to develop a unifying theory, devise public policy, and put in place regulatory systems for the use of toxic substances. The third edition of The Dose Makes the Poison continues with these themes, but adds to the discussion \\"drugs, food additives, cosmetics, vitamins, second hand smoke, lead in toys imported from China, the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) cyclooxyogenase (COX) issues, and bisphenyl A found in plastics.\\" Reception Ottoboni received praise for her measured, step-by-step approach to toxicology and writing style that makes accessible to non-scientists material that could otherwise be \\"overwhelmingly technical.\\" Examples and illustrations used in the book to reinforce concepts are \\"practical and realistic\\". Though not as detailed, referenced, or annotated as a toxicology textbook, The Dose Makes the Poison: A Plain Language Guide to Toxicology, is recommended by reviewers as a basic guidebook and entry point in learning about the field of toxicology.

Kasai trained in other forms of dance, but turned to butoh in the 1960s when he met and began to work with these two men. He started his own studio in 1971 but closed it in 1979 to move and study Eurythmy in Germany. He did not dance professionally at the time and for years after his return to Japan in 1986 he stayed off the stage stating that he felt too disconnected from Japanese society to perform. He returned to professional dance in 1994, with the work Saraphita and revived his studio Tenshi kan, now influenced by Eurythmy and other dance principles. He has since performed, choreographed and taught in Asia, the Americas and Europe, but his choreography is sufficiently different from most other butoh that its authenticity has been questioned. Life Kasai was born in Japan, and grew up in the Mie Prefecture. His family was upper middle class which he says was very education conscious. His grandfather spoke good English and was an interpreter for foreign cultural figures and visitors. His father was a banker and both his parents were active Christians. He began dancing as a child, listening to his mother‚Äôs organ music at church. Later, Kasai went on to study modern dance, ballet and pantomime before discovering butoh in the early 1960s. His butoh career began at this time but he took a hiatus in the late 1970s to move to Germany with his family. He stayed in this country from 1979 to 1985, studying at the Eurythmy School in Stuttgart and studying European culture in depth. He describes European culture as having the ability to take dualistic concepts and reunite them, something he says is missing in Japanese monistic thinking. In particular he studied he philosophy of Rudof Steiner, which rebelled against dualistic thinking. He studied Eurythmy to answer two questions, ‚ÄúIs consciousness born or established by the body, or the other way around?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat is a life that is a life? Is life coming from a material or from somewhere else?‚Äù His goal was to deconstruct his Japanese notion of body to construct something new. He returned to Japan permanently in 1986, but he felt lost and unable to reattach to the people and places he knew before. Without social connection, he felt he could not dance and did not do so again until he worked out a way to reconnect to his native land. From 1986 to 1994, he did not return to professional dance, but rather lectured anthroposophy of Rudolf Steiner and held workshops on Eurythmy. Between Germany and this period, Kasai had a fifteen-year lapse from public performances. Since then, Kasai has resumed his career both in Japan and abroad. One of his sons, Mitsutke is also a dancer, combining butoh, hip hop and break dance, appearing solo and with his father both in Japan and abroad. Career Although of a younger generation, Kasai is considered an originator of butoh, and a pioneer of the art in the 1960s and 1970s. He is acknowledged for coining the name butoh (later ankoku butoh, or dance of utter darkness) . Today is one of Japan‚Äôs butoh masters, and has been called ‚Äúangel of butoh.‚Äù His career has had him both perform, choreograph and teach butoh, modern dance, contemporary dance, and Eurythmy in the Americas, Europe and Asia, in countries such as Chile, Argentina, Mexico, Germany, France and South Korea, as well as his native Japan. Kasai began his butoh dancing career after meeting Kazuo Ohno, performing Gi-gi under him in 1963 and then working with Tatsumi Hijikata in 1964. He worked with Hijikata until 1971, performing productions such as Bara-iro dansu (Rose colored dance) (1965) and Emotion in Metaphysics (1967). In 1971, at the age of 28, he founded his own studio called Tenshi kan in Kokubunji, just west of Tokyo. The name means \\"House of Angels\\", named after Rome‚Äôs ‚Äúangel castle‚Äù Santanjiero, which had meaning for Kasai because of its history of housing both prisoners and paintings. The studio trained butoh artists Setsuko Yamada, Kota Yamazaki and others. One reason for starting Tenshikan was that he was looking for something very radical, something that could exist without a social power structure or centralized authority, separating modern dance from political or religious thought. The methodology was to not teach dance to avoid authority and allow creative freedom (although training of the body was strict), which lasted for about seven years before he shut it down to move to Germany. Kasai did not return to professional dance until 1994, when he created the work Saraphita, which he considers to be his first socially active work. After this he began to present his own solo pieces along with choreographing for other butoh artists such as Kuniki Kisanuki, Kim Ito, Naoko Shirakawa and Ikuyo Kuroda, as well as ballet dancer Farouk Ruzimatov. At this time he also revived Tenshi- kan, using principles from Eurythmy. He continues to use these principles, but does not consider them all-encompassing, needing those from butoh as well. Where the two intersect is the notion of sound and voice being primeval. After Saraphita, Kasai produced My own apocalypse (1994) followed by Work Exusiai (1998) . Pollen Revolution was produced in 2001, which toured the United States in 2004, and was performed at the Festival Internacional Cervantino in 2005. In this piece, he appeared as a woman in a kabuki dress from Kyokanoko Musume D≈çj≈çji, morphing into a hip-hop dancer. In 2012, Kasai worked butoh artist Akaji Maro of Dairakudaban to produce Hayasasurahime. Although the two are contemporary butoh masters, they had not worked together before. The piece was first presented at the Setagaya Public Theater in Tokyo in 2012. The work is based on the ancient text, Kojiki, about the origins of the world and included butoh, modern dance and Eurythmy performances, danced to Beethoven‚Äôs Ninth Symphony. In 2013, Hayasasurahime was nominated for the Japan Dance Forum Prize. In 2014, this work was presented at the Festival Internacional Cervantino, but with all female dancers, except for the role of the goddess after which the work is named, who was portrayed by his son Mitsutake. The Japan Society commissioned Kasai to create Butoh America, in collaboration with five emerging U.S.-based performers, a work that explores modern-day America. Despite his success, his work has been criticized as not be butoh. In his first performance in San Francisco in 1994, a heckler shouted ‚ÄúThis is not butoh!‚Äù to which Kasai responded from the stage ‚ÄúThis is my flesh, this is my blood.‚Äù Similarly, at the premiere of Butoh American in 2009 at the New York Butoh Festival, several in the audience states it was more like modern dance. ‚ÄúClaudia la Rocco in The New York Times wrote of that evening, ‚ÄúThis was Butoh with a big wink. Or maybe it wasn't Butoh at all.‚Äù Artistry Kasai's work is noted for fusing Asian and Western elements, as he views butoh not as a Japanese style of dance but rather transnational and transhistorial, seeing parallels in the work of Commedia dell‚ÄôArte to the bodies of Vaslav Nijinsky, Isadora Duncan, and Tatsumi Hijikata, and sometimes more in ballet dancers than traditional butoh artists. He has been called the \\"Ninjinsky of butoh\\" and Dance magazine called his work ‚Äú...part Marcel Marceau, part Mick Jagger...‚Äù Kasai considered butoh to be more of a philosophy than a dance movement. His work returns repeatedly to two themes: apocalypse as both destructive and generative and the struggle between the energies of organic and inorganic matter. The latter is often embodied as the working of Earth itself, with its organic and inorganic components/forces as well as the interaction of humans and technology. Kasai has also been working with temporal themes since his return to the stage in the 1990s, stating that his butoh philosophy is future-oriented. The philosophy is most evident in Kasai's thoughts of the body, movement and language. Like Hijikata, Kasai believes that the body, words and choreography are intricately related but in somewhat different ways. Kasai considers dance to be an inherently social activity and the dancer should strive for a ‚Äúbetween space‚Äù which is an intersection between the dancer and the audience that happens when the rational mind quiets and the body begins to move. He states that dance eliminates the physical self, with humans becoming ‚Äúbodies of sensation.‚Äù Since words live in the air, as the body moves, it is the way to understand the body. Through what he calls ‚Äúvoice power‚Äù the body is not ‚ÄúI‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äù but rather an impersonal pronoun that transcends dancer and spectator to a total consciousness. Kasai‚Äôs butoh is strongly influenced by Eurythmy but it is also the extension of Hijikata‚Äôs butoh, especially in the role of language, and the concept that the body is something that is created, rather than given by nature. As a dancer, Kasai promotes a different body aesthetic than in traditional butoh (slow, horizontal and low positions), with quicker movement, vertical movement, use of the entire stage and eyes engaged rather than looking off into the distance and upward posture. He stated that his teacher Kazuo Ohno always told him not to move around so much, but Kasai has criticized the slow, reserved movements of most butoh, stating that he cannot understand dance without much movement, believing very slow movement risks turning it into an object. Despite this, his solo dance style has been compared to that of Ohno and considers this three-year apprenticeship with him as formative. Kasai states that his is music-oriented and weak in visual images, and that when he hears music, movement flows naturally. As a choreographer, Kasai states that Hijikata is his greatest influence although he did not study under him directly. Both believe choreography is external, rather than internal to the dancer as it gives concepts to the dancers to create a collective body. Another common thread is to not pre-prepare the choreography, but rather to concentrate on what one feels intuitively between the dancer and choreographer before movement begins. As a choreographer, Kasai states he must sense the unique ‚Äúsmell‚Äù of each dancer, be it ‚Äútart‚Äù, ‚Äùacidic‚Äù, ‚Äúsweet‚Äù or other as each has a unique quality, which helps determine what movements are best for them. He tries to avoid giving dancers images based on words, but rather has them focus on forms. He also tends to have dancers avoid the skills they acquired in their training (Graham, ballet, etc.) and work on something they have not done before. However, he does admit that he does have an overall image in mind for the production, with dancers‚Äô movements conforming to that image.

Although Niuean mythology reports a colonization before 500 AD, the island was settled by Polynesians from Samoa around 900 AD.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, \\"Niue\\" The five principal gods of Niue are known as the tupua (principle gods of Niue), and include Fao, Huanaki, Fakahoko, Laga-iki, and Lagi-atea, who by various accounts, arrived from Fonuagalo (the lost country), Tulia, Toga-liulu, or perhaps other islands. In Avatele myths, the gods are said to have come from within the earth instead of Fonuagalo. There are also many other gods in Niuean mythology from fish gods to flying rats. Background According to Peniamina, a Pacific Island missionary stationed on the island, the islanders consider Huanaki and Fao as their ancestors. They believe that Huanaki and Fao were the first to locate the island which had slightly surfaced above the ground with the sea striking its shores. As they landed on the island, they brought down their feet in a forcible action upon the island surface twice; at the first stomping, the water (tides) receded, resulting in emergence of land, and with the second stomping, greenery in the form of grass, trees and other vegetation was created. The Nui myths of the Pacific islands have been interpreted as a result of two coseismic-uplift events that had occurred at the island in the past 2,000 years, akin to a similar situation prevalent in several areas of the southwest and west Pacific Islands. The uplift produced by earthquakes could be the reason for relating them to the stomping myths of Niue and also from Tonga. Deities The five tupua (principle gods of Niue) are Fao, Fakahoko, Huanaki, Laga-iki, and Lagi-atea. According to myth the first to set foot on the island was Fao, followed by Huanaki. It is also said that Fao was one of the five principal gods of Niue (tupua), said to have arrived on Niue beneath a pool on the reef near the base of the cliffs, and to have then \\"ascended to build a residence at Toga-liulu\\". Fakahoko is a war god and one of the five major gods of the island. Lagi-atea is one of the five principal gods of Niue, and is said to have caused death in the universe. Lagihalulu forebodes ill luck. Lage-iki is another of the five major gods of the islanders; he has many children and is said to reside in the western region of the island; he is the cause of death in the world. Many other gods and goddesses are mentioned in Niuean mythology: *Atelapa ‚Äì the god of the kale (Porphyrio bird). *Fakakonaatua ‚Äì represents meteors and thunder, and is worshiped before battle to poison the gods of the enemy. *Fakapaete ‚Äì a god who protects against attack by stones. *Halapouli ‚Äì a god who is said to be invoked when throwing a spear. *Halevao ‚Äì the god of the peka (flying fox). According to legend, Halevao and Tamalafafa the pigeon came from a grave to \\"fly along the way of Nuku-tapa and Oloolo, which is a burnt forest; and they descended to the cliffs and the top of the cliffs on the coast\\". *Haliua ‚Äì the god of the uga (crab). *Hokohoko ‚Äì goddess of Niue. *Lagiofa ‚Äì a god recalled during war. *Lagitaitaia ‚Äì a god of fish with stripes on its body who is said to quiet the sea following a storm. *Lata ‚Äì a wise god of benevolence. *Liavaha ‚Äì a fish god who after a sea storm quiets the sea. *Luatotolo ‚Äì a god who can force all other gods to the seabed. *Luatupua ‚Äì one of the major gods on the southern region of the island who is also capable of forcing other gods to the bottom of the sea. *Lageikiua, Lagihulugia and Lagiloa are other gods of the island. *Makapoelagi ‚Äì the god of the sky. *Makapoe-Lagi is one of the major gods of the eastern part of the island. *Tafehemoana ‚Äì a powerful sea god. *Tagaloa-fofoa, Tagaloa-lahi, Tagaloa-motumotu, Tagaloa-uluulu are Niue goddesses. *Tamalafafa ‚Äì the god of the pigeon. *Tihatala ‚Äì the god of the tuaki (tropical bird) *Tilalofonua ‚Äì the god of the kuma (rat) and bird of the heavens. According to myth, Tilalofonua was said to have begged Halevao for some wings, but to no avail. He prayed for a long time and was eventually granted them by Halevao after demonstrating his love. *Tolioatua ‚Äì the Hunger god and god of thieves.

Early life Dobkin was a tiny child when her father died; soon after, she left Russia in the care of an aunt and uncle, and settled in Baltimore, Maryland. That domestic arrangement was also short- lived, and ended when Mary was found alone and unconscious on a winter night, with no shoes and severe frostbite, when she was six years old. She spent much of her remaining childhood in hospitals, enduring a long series of operations, including the amputation of both feet and part of one leg. Dobkin used a wheelchair or crutches for most of her life. By 1910, Mary resided with and had been adopted by Anne and Harry Dobkin. (1910 census and family history as retold by Mary‚Äôs niece, Bessie Pearlman Cohen.) Dobkin remembered hearing the crowds at Baltimore Orioles games from her hospital room, and that sparked an interest in baseball. She also remembered learning to speak English from a radio in the hospital, and learning to read from deciphering the sports pages in newspapers. via Newspapers.com Coaching and advocacy Having spent most of her childhood in hospitals or other care homes, and without any family connections, Dobkin lived in relative poverty as an adult, in public housing in Baltimore. She believed baseball could encourage the children in her neighborhood as it had done for her, so she raised funds for equipment and uniforms, and started a team, the Dobkin Dynamites, which she coached. In time the Mary Dobkin Athletic Club reached over 50,000 Baltimore children, and expanded to softball, basketball and football activities as well. Her youth sports programs were mainly supported by donations and benefactors, prominent among them Dr. Ralph and Ida Katz. In 1941, Dobkin became the first woman to serve as Baltimore's municipal baseball manager. In 1965, the Baltimore Orioles held a \\"Mary Dobkin Day\\" to honor the local coach for her work, and invited two of the boys involved in her programs to be honorary batboys for that game. Dobkin threw the ceremonial first pitch at the sixth game of the 1979 World Series, played in Baltimore. via Newspapers.com A Hallmark Hall of Fame television movie, Aunt Mary (1979), starred Jean Stapleton as Dobkin. \\"I was the first manager to integrate a team, the first to play a girl, the first to coach three sports (baseball, basketball, and football), the first living person to have a playing field named for them, and now I'm the first to have my story told on TV,\\" Dobkin noted of her many accomplishments, in 1979. In honor of her contributions, Dobkin was selected to throw out the ceremonial first pitch of game six of the 1979 World Series. Personal life and legacy Dobkin always volunteered her services, because a salary would have jeopardized her disability benefits. Beyond sports, she was noted for throwing an annual Christmas party for the children of her neighborhood. via Newspapers.com Mary Dobkin died in August 1987, age 84, after a stroke. A Mary Dobkin Park was dedicated in Baltimore in 1975. There is an exhibit about Mary Dobkin at the Babe Ruth Birthplace and Museum in Baltimore.

The Powell family  George Powell was born into a family which had a particularly bad press in St Helena. His grandfather, Gabriel Powell senior, participated in the failed 1684 rebellion and led the fight for the rights of the rebels in its aftermath. He had been condemned to death, but managed to escape from his prison cell and secured a passage to Europe in 1688.T.H. Brooke, History of the Island of St. Helena, London, 1824, pp. 125-129; H.R. Janisch, Extracts From the St. Helena Records, London, 1885, pp. 41-43. George Powell‚Äôs father, Gabriel Powell junior, became the richest plantation owner on St Helena and was criticized for his avarice and the cruel treatment of his slaves.H.R. Janisch, Extracts From the St. Helena Records, London, 1885, pp. 116, 122, 128, 148, 153, 159, 174, 186-187. George Powell appears to have taken after his two forebears in many respects.  Powell's career on St Helena  Map of St Helena showing Powell Bay on the south coast opposite Jamestown. In his early years, Powell seemed to have remained free of controversy. In 1739 he was appointed a member of the four-person St Helena Executive Council.H.R. Janisch, Extracts From the St. Helena Records, London, 1885, p. 182. Two years later, aged about 31, he married Sarah Frances.St Helena Archives: St James Parish marriage register vol. 1, p. 8. By this time, he had also positioned himself as a champion of anti-corruption on the island.H.R. Janisch, Extracts From the St. Helena Records, London, 1885, p. 184. But St Helena historian Thomas Brooke, an ex-Governor of the island, claimed that Powell deliberately ingratiated the directors of the East India Company by exposing fraud in order to gain a position from which be could perpetrate even worse excesses.T.H. Brooke, History of the Island of St. Helena, London, 1824, p. 250. However, caution should be exercised, as almost all the sources for the St Helena period are hostile to the Powell family, partly because all three generations had, at some stage, come into direct conflict with the Governing authorities of the island. Powell had been promoted to the rank of deputy governor in May 1741 to help the new Governor, Major Thomas Lambert, bring a new broom to the island‚Äôs affairs. But with the sudden death of Lambert, Powell was appointed acting governor in July 1742.H.R. Janisch, Extracts From the St. Helena Records, London, 1885, p. 184. He made an enemy of key islanders, particularly, Councilor Dixon, who was instrumental in bringing charges of large-scale fraud against him in May 1744.T.H. Brooke, History of the Island of St. Helena, London, 1824, pp. 254-256. Powell refused to defend himself and claimed, like his grandfather and the rebels of 1684, that he was only prepared to submit to British law through a British Court of Justice rather than a self-interested tribunal of the East India Company.T.H. Brooke, History of the Island of St. Helena, London, 1824, p. 257; H.R. Janisch, Extracts From the St. Helena Records, London, 1885, pp. 186-187; P. Gosse, St Helena, 1502-1938, London, 1938, pp. 180-183. When the directors of the Company did move against him, he simply liquidated his extensive assets and fled the island for North America.  Establishing himself in South Carolina  Powell‚Äôs public record was to be very different in his adopted country. In South Carolina, he established himself on a large plantation, called ‚ÄòWeymouth‚Äô, at the mouth of the Great Pee Dee River.The Charles Town Gazette, 27 June 1769. Cf. A.S. Salley, Marriage Notices in the South Carolina Gazette and Its Successors, 1732-1802, Albany, 1902, p. 39. As early as 1752, he was elected as a member for Prince George Parish in the Colony of South Carolina‚Äôs Commons House of Assembly and was appointed to a committee to report back on a petition from the locals for courthouses and law-enforcement measures.A. Gregg, History of the Old Cheraws, Columbia, 1867, p. 132. Six years later, Powell is listed as a Colonel with the South Carolina militia. In late 1759, he participated in a three-month expedition against the Cherokee Nation, during the period when it was cooperating with the French.See the Muster Roll and Pay List of his regiment covering the period 18 October 1759 to 15 January 1760 in H. Hasan, A Primary Source History of the Colony of South Carolina, New York, 2006, p. 37. Almost a decade later, he took a leading role in an attempt to quell disturbances in the ‚ÄòBack Country‚Äô by a group ex-slaves and small landowners led by an armed band known as the ‚ÄòRegulators‚Äô. The main leader, at this time, was Gideon Gibson, an African-American landowner. He had overpowered a local constable‚Äôs party near Mars Bluff, killing one and whipping thirteen others.A. Gregg, History of the Old Cheraws, Columbia, 1867, pp. 138-140. Powell had been dispatched with a small force to arrest Gibson and bring order back to the frontier areas of the Pee Dee.A. Gregg, History of the Old Cheraws, Columbia, 1867, p. 146. On 26 August 1768, William Bull, informed the Council, that he had received a letter from Colonel Powell in which he had described his inability to pacify the district and how even his own men sympathized with the Regulators and refused to act against them.A. Gregg, History of the Old Cheraws, Columbia, 1867, pp. 146-150. Cf. the reconstruction proffered in D.J. Sharfstein, The Invisible Line: A Secret History of Race in America, New York, 2011, Chapter 1. It may be the case that Powell demonstrated a significant lack of judgement and understanding of local politics in his failure to carry out his mission.R.M. Weir, The Last of American Freemen, Macon, 1986, footnote 9, pp. 5-6; R.N. Klein, Unification of a Slave State: the Rise of the Planter Class in the South Carolina Backcountry, 1760-1808, North Carolina, 1990, p. 69. It took a few years for the Regulators to disband and for the frontier issues in the Back Country to be resolved. The Council was effectively powerless to stop them and neither Gibson nor his colleagues were brought to account. It was not really until a system of circuit courts was established that the movement dissipated. Legislation addressing their issues was put into effect in 1772 and it is only then that the Regulators disappeared from the record.J. Haw, John and Edward Rutledge of South Carolina, Athens (Georgia), 1997, p. 40; P. Heinegg, Free African Americans of North Carolina, Virginia and South Carolina: From the Colonial Period to About 1820, vo. 1, fifth ed., Baltimore, 2005, p. 431.  Involvement in the independence movement  Edward Rutledge In the late 1680s, Powell was also earning himself a reputation for supporting the growing independence movement. He had been a provincial judge, but was replaced by a Loyalist as the Council put its own supporters in the positions of authority. He also supported the Commons House‚Äô opposition to the assumption that the Council was an ‚Äòupper house‚Äô. In 1772, as a magistrate in Charleston, appointed directly by the Commons House, he sided with another pro-Independence judge to support Edward Rutledge in advocating on behalf of an incarcerated printer. The principles at stake in this case were more significant than just freedom of speech. The case brought into question the extent and nature of the Council itself and whether it really held the power to have a citizen jailed.J. Haw, John and Edward Rutledge of South Carolina, Athens (Georgia), 1997, pp. 54-56; J. Mercantini, Who Shall Rule at Home?: The Evolution of South Carolina Political Culture, 1748-1776, South Carolina, 2007, p. 239; A. Palmer, A Rule of Law: Elite Political Authority and the Coming of the Revolution in the South Carolina Lowcountry, 1763-1776, Boston, 2014, pp. 225-226. In this celebrated decision, George and his colleague disputed the legislative power of the Council. The printer was released to popular acclaim in Charleston. The Council, dominated as it was by Loyalists, tried to order the Commons Assembly to reverse the decision and dismiss the two judges, but this was ignored. It was a significant blow for the Loyalists. Powell went on to consolidate his reputation as an American patriot in the early years of the American War of Independence. He was elected to the first and second Provincial Congresses of South Carolina, serving as its first Speaker.Journal of the Provincial Congress of South Carolina, 1776, pp. 121-122; W. Moultrie, Memoirs of the American Revolution, vol. 1, New York, 1802, p. 18. On 3 April 1776, Powell and John Parsons, had the privilege of addressing the newly appointed revolutionary Governor, John Rutledge, on behalf of the Provincial Congress. Powell‚Äôs speech was a carefully crafted justification of the war and a polite reminder for the Governor that the new constitution provided the overriding principles of government, to which he should adhere.Quoted in A. Gregg, History of the Old Cheraws, Columbia, 1867, pp. 258-259. Whatever is thought about the infamy of Powell and his antecedents on St Helena, this speech helps explain his family‚Äôs ideological position concerning the excesses of British colonialism.  Military record  Col. William Moultrie In the military sphere, Powell was active in helping organise the defenses of Charleston and the northern region of the state.Journal of the Provincial Congress of South Carolina, 1776, pp. 43-48, 92-93; Gregg, History of the Old Cheraws, pp. 240, 247-249, 255-256, 286. His work must have been important, as the South Carolina militia was successful in repelling the first British attack on Charleston in 1776. But Powell‚Äôs military record is not altogether positive. On two occasions, Powell seems reluctant to deploy his troops to reinforce other areas. On 28 November 1775, Congress ordered him to send 600 men to reinforce Colonel Richardson. On 20 December (i.e. almost four weeks later) he still had not acted on the order. As it happened, the order was reversed and there were no consequences for his tardiness.A. Gregg, History of the Old Cheraws, Columbia, 1867, pp, 247-249. Powell may have had better intelligence than Congress, which may have motivated him in ignoring the order, or this may be an example of his wily ways. The second example occurs in April 1778, after set backs for the Americans in Philadelphia, when the general expectation amongst the South Carolina commanders is that they should all pitch in to reinforce Washington in the north. Powell‚Äôs Congress colleagues for the Parish of St David, Samuel Wise and Henry Harrington, reported that ‚ÄòCol. Powell told me yesterday he would not go off, for we should have enough on our hands without troubling them‚Äô.A. Gregg, History of the Old Cheraws, Columbia, 1867, p. 286. Again, it is hard to determine whether Powell was acting in his own self-interest, or whether, as a senior and experienced commander, he was genuine in his caution. In any case, he was right to consider that the situation in South Carolina was precarious. The British approached Charleston in May 1779, but had to retreat as General Benjamin Lincoln marched to the aid of the city, which was defended by General William Moultrie's troops.E. McCrady,\\"The History of South Carolina in the Revolution, 1775-1780,\\" London, 2018),pp. 362-363, 374-375. In early 1776 Powell faced intense criticism of his mission to build a new fort at Cheraw Hill to shore up the northern reaches of the State and to garrison this stockade with supplies of gunpowder and a force of 50 men. Congress recalled him after considerable debate on the matter, in which Powell and his advocates argued strongly for its continuance. Nevertheless, the initiative was deemed to be too expensive and an inappropriate location for a major defensive investment. Another Colonel of the South Carolina forces, William Moultrie, who later became Governor of the State, was particularly critical of the venture.W. Moultrie, Memoirs of the American Revolution, vol. 1, New York, 1802, pp. 92-93. It might be argued that Powell, once more, was using public funds to suit his own purposes, as Cheraw Hill was in close proximity to his personal estates.  Death  George Gabriel Powell died in January 1779.B.G. Moss, Roster of South Carolina Patriots in the American Revolution, vol. 2 (K-Z), Baltimore, 1993, p. 783. He was a flawed character, seen by some as a patriot and others as a schemer. Alexander Gregg, the Cheraws district historian and a local bishop, eulogized him as follows. :No man of the time had occupied a more conspicuous or honorable place in all connected with the public interests of the Pedee than George Gabriel Powell. On the 21st January his useful life was brought to a close in Christ Church Parish. Having early won the confidence and affection of the people on the Pedee, he retained his place in their esteem with singular uniformity through years of eventful changes, relinquishing at times, in their behalf, positions of more commanding influence, returning to their service as his first love, and devoting to it his mature labours to the end of his career. His memory should never cease to be cherished with admiring gratitude by the descendants of those whom he so faithfully served.A. Gregg, History of the Old Cheraws, Columbia, 1867, pp. 291-292. If Gregg had been aware of Powell‚Äôs disgrace as the acting Governor of St Helena, and the brutal treatment of the slaves, who worked on his plantations, his obituary might not have been so positive.For example, the St Helena historian, Brooke, said that Powell was '‚Ä¶a man ‚Ä¶devoid of all principle. Powell turned informer, and had the address to conceal his real character'. See T.H. Brooke, History of the Island of St. Helena, London, 1824, p. 250; cf. pp. 254-256. Even the more recent historians of the island are highly critical of Powell: e.g. P. Gosse, St Helena, 1502-1938, London, 1938, pp. 176-183.

He was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys in the third round of the 2015 NFL Draft. He played college football at the University of Florida. He has also played for the New Orleans Saints, Oakland Raiders, and Denver Broncos. Early years Green attended Tampa Catholic High School, where he was a starter at left tackle. As a junior, he was named second-team FSWA 2A all-state. As a senior, he helped his team earn a Florida 2B Runner-Up finish with an 11-2 record and rush for over 3,000 yards. He was rated the No. 6 offensive lineman in the nation. College career Green committed to the University of Florida over Ohio State, Georgia, Tennessee and USC as a 4-star recruit. He redshirted the 2010 season, after dressing for 12 games but not recording a play. In 2011, he started the first 8 games at right tackle before injuring his ankle and missing 4 games. Green earned Freshman All-American honors. As a sophomore, he recorded 10 starts, but missed two games due to injury. He missed the entire 2013 season after suffering a torn labrum prior to the opener. The next year, he started 11 games, playing both right (9 games) and left tackle (2 games) positions. Professional career Dallas Cowboys Green was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the third round (91st overall) of the 2015 NFL Draft, after dropping because of durability issues. After injuring his hip during organized team activities, he had surgery on June 16, which caused him to miss all of training camp and start the season on the physically unable to perform list. Although he was activated on December 3 from the PUP list, he was declared inactive in the last 5 games of the season. In 2016, he was the backup swing tackle on what was considered the best offensive line in the NFL. He started at left tackle against the Chicago Bears and the San Francisco 49ers in place of an injured Tyron Smith. He suffered a sprained foot against the 49ers that held him out several weeks, before developing a herniated disk. He underwent surgery and was placed on the injured reserve list on December 16, finishing with a total of 12 missed games. In 2017, Green was seen as the potential starter at right tackle after Doug Free retired, but because he wasn't available during OTAs while recovering from his previous back injury, it opened the door for La'el Collins to move from offensive guard to tackle and earn the starter position. Green was then given the starting left guard role, to replace Ronald Leary who left in free agency. On July 31 a week into training camp, he suffered a strained rotator cuff in practice, forcing him to miss 15 days. He started the first three contests of the season at left guard, until missing the Friday practice before the Los Angeles Rams game with a hip bursitis, giving Jonathan Cooper a chance to secure the starting position. Green returned to the backup swing tackle role for the next contests. In Week 8 against the Kansas City Chiefs, he played the final six snaps at left tackle in place of an injured Tyron Smith. He was named the starter at left tackle the next game against the Atlanta Falcons, but allowed five sacks to defensive end Adrian Clayborn and was replaced in favor of Byron Bell, who ended up giving one more sack. Even though the Cowboys coaches were criticized for not adjusting the game plan to stop Clayborn, Green never recovered from the debacle and did not play another snap for the rest of the season. In 2018, with the signing of offensive tackle Cameron Fleming in free agency, Green was asked to concentrate on playing right tackle, but struggled in preseason games as the backup to Collins. As in previous seasons, he also had to fight through bouts of dehydration during training camp, that forced him to leave practices early on different occasions with cramping. He was released by the Cowboys on September 1, 2018. New Orleans Saints On October 24, 2018, Green was signed by the New Orleans Saints. He was released on November 21, 2018. Oakland Raiders On November 27, 2018, Green was signed by the Oakland Raiders. He started in Week 15 for the Raiders game against the Bengals. On March 15, 2019, Green re-signed with the Raiders.

The district is centered on Redlands' Santa Fe Railway depot, which was established in 1888. The current station building, a Classical Revival structure, was built in 1909-10 to replace the original depot and lost passenger service in 1938. The buildings surrounding the station represent many of the important components of the city's economy, particularly the orange packing industry. Several packing houses remain from the city's heyday as an orange packing center, forming one of the largest remaining groups of orange packing houses in the Inland Empire. A number of the other buildings were used by growers' associations and other groups in the citrus industry. The district also includes three buildings from the city's historic Chinatown, which thrived from the 1880s through the 1920s after Chinese immigrants came to Redlands to build the railroad. . The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 29, 1991, and the California Points of Historical Interest. The depot was purchased from Krikorian Theatres founder George Krikorian by a real estate development company with ties to Esri executives in September 2017. (Esri is also funding a train station next to its nearby headquarters.) Due to the new ownership, the depot may be restored and integrated with the under construction adjacent Redlands‚ÄìDowntown Arrow rail station.

In January 1812, Admiral Edward Pellew appointed Lieutenant Richard Howell Fleming to command Pyllades, later renamed Carlotta. Some sources treat this Carlotta as the salvaged Carlotta. However, the database of the National Maritime Museum (NMM) treats them as two vessels. Currently available online resources do not yield information on Pylades, or her capture or other origin. There were apparently no French naval vessels of that name, suggesting that she was a merchant vessel. Furthermore, the NMM database allocates the capture of the brig Carlotta to HMS Carlotta captured in 1810, and Pylades to the second HMS Carlotta. If the Royal Navy captured or otherwise acquired Pylades shortly before the first Carlotta was wrecked, it would be consistent with Navy practice to name Pylades Carlotta as there was already an on active duty. Under Fleming's command Carlotta captured several small vessels, including a French privateer, and partook of various services on the coasts of Tuscany and Genoa.O'Byrne (1849), Vol. 1, p.366. Carlotta shared in the proceeds from the capture on 24 May 1813 of the privateer Columbo, which may be the privateer alluded to. The actual captors appear to have been and . On 13 October 1812 Carlotta detained the settee St Vittoria and put a prize crew consisting of Midshipman Hugh Stewart Morris and two sailors, Francis Baynson and Fran√ßois Richie, on board with instructions that they were to sail her in company with Carlotta to Malta. However, on 19 October, St Vittoria went her own way, stopping first at Port St Vito and then to sailing on to Palermo. There Morris sold part of her cargo. After spending almost three weeks at Palermo, Stewart sailed to Cephalu where he disposed of the rest of the cargo. Then he scuttled St Vittoria, but sold the wreck for 373 ounces of gold to a man named \\"Fellipo\\". Morris, Baynson, and Richie split the proceeds and made their way to Messina. However, Lieutenant-colonel Coffin, the deputy quartermaster general at Messina, arrested them as they were about to take a boat to Calabria, and sent them to Malta. A court martial convened at Port Mahon aboard on 8 and 9 April 1813 sentenced all three miscreants to be mulcted of all outstanding pay and prize money. It also sentenced Morris to two years of solitary confinement, after which he could never serve as a petty officer or officer in the Navy. Baynson was sentenced to 200 lashes. Richie was an impressed Frenchman and the court martial ruled that he was to be treated as a prisoner of war.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 30, pp67-9.

Archer was the first Brazilian citizen to be executed abroad. Early life Marco was born in a wealthy family in Manaus, Brazil, and his mother, Carolina, was a state civil servant in Rio de Janeiro, after the family moved into that city. He began drug trafficking as a teenager, directly with Colombian cartels, bringing cocaine from Medellin to Rio de Janeiro and to the United States. As an adult, he became a paraglider and frequently travelled to Southeastern Asia to engage in the sport. In 1997, he suffered an accident in Bali that almost cost him his life. Archer was described as having travelled around the world, having a very extensive and successful love life and enjoying a lavish life, and also as never having used a single weapon throughout his career in drug trafficking. Arrest Marco Archer was arrested at Soekarno‚ÄìHatta International Airport, Jakarta, in 2003, with 13.4 kilos of cocaine hidden inside hang-gliding tubes. He lived on the Indonesian island of Bali for 15 years and spoke Indonesian fluently. He fled, but was eventually captured 15 days later, while trying to escape to East Timor. He was prosecuted, convicted for drug trafficking and sentenced to death. During his early days in prison, Archer shared a cell with fellow Brazilian convicted Rodrigo Gularte. Execution Marco Archer was shot in the early hours of January 18, 2015, after eleven years in the Indonesian death row and several delays of his execution, in the prison complex of Cilacap Prison, in Java Island, 400 kilometres from Jakarta, the country's capital. Marco Archer had his last Roman Catholic rites denied, according to Roman Catholic Priest Charles Burrows who was responsible to comfort him in the last moments of his death. Archer was dragged from his cell, as he cried and said \\"help me.\\" Archer chose to be executed on foot and blindfolded, according to the \\"Folha de S. Paulo\\". He died with a single shot fired into his chest. Moreira was Roman Catholic and Brazilian embassy had hoped that at least spiritual solace before his death would be offered to him. However, Indonesian authorities refused the presence of a priest, because there was no letter from Marco's attorney allowing spiritual presence . After the execution of Marco Archer, his body was cremated and his ashes were transported to Brazil. In Rio de Janeiro a Catholic Mass was celebrated in honour of him. Reactions His execution, after being denied all requests for clemency made by the Brazilian government, created a crisis between Brazil and Indonesia. This resulted in the recall of the Brazilian ambassador in Jakarta to return to Brazil under the instructions of the government of President Dilma Rousseff. After Archer's death, the president of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, issued a statement saying she was outraged and the execution seriously affected the relationships between the two countries. She called the Brazilian ambassador for consultations.

She lived in the small community for the six-week duration of the trials where she was often in contact with the men standing trial. Accusations and trial In 1999 a teenage girl whom Marks referred to as Belinda came forward about being raped by a visitor to the island named Randy Quinn. Though Pitcairn was mostly self-policed, Gail Cox, a police officer from Kent was visiting to deliver police training to the island's one designated police officer and was able to take a statement from Belinda. While Belinda's attack by Randy Quinn ended with his sentence being remitted Belinda admitted to Cox that she had been raped by other men on the island. As a result of this statement police forces started Operation Unique, interviewing women who had lived on the island at any point during the previous twenty years. 100% of the women interviewed said they had been raped and investigators were disturbed to learn that the male relatives of the rape victims were often in fact rapists themselves who preyed on other young islander girls. When investigators came to the island to interview the men accused of rape they readily admitted to having sex with girls as young as twelve while claiming it was consensual, though the girls themselves said that the rapes began when they were much, much younger.

Early life and education Russel S. Smart was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba on June 20, 1885 to George Alexander Smart and his wife. His mother died when he was six months old, and he was abandoned by his father who left to Atlanta, Georgia while he was a child. Smart was raised by two maternal aunts in reduced circumstances. Despite his circumstance, Smart attended the School of Practical Science at the University of Toronto, paying for his tuition by working as a packing manager at a local Woolworth's when he was not in class. He graduated with a diploma in mechanical engineering at the School in 1904.Transactions of the University of Toronto Engineering Society (1910), Vol. 23, p. 164. While he was Toronto, Smart came across an advertisement for a job as a manager of the Ottawa office of the patent agency Fetherstonhaugh & Co. With no other job prospects, Smart decided to apply for the job, and was offered the position by F. B. Fetherstonhaugh on January 1, 1904. After graduation, Smart moved to Ottawa to begin practice as a patent attorney. Around the same time, he received a B.A. from Queen's University through extramural courses. In 1908, he married Emma Louise \\"Louie\\" Parr. Legal career At first, Smart practiced only as a patent agent with Fetherstonhaugh & Co. However, as patent litigation became more prevalent in the early part of the 20th century, it was necessary for Smart to hire local lawyers to represent his clients before the Exchequer Court and Supreme Court of Canada. He therefore decided to take a correspondence course in law at McGill University, and was called to the Bar of Quebec in 1911. He later returned to the University of Toronto to complete a fourth year in the mechanical engineering program (which was optional when Smart was originally enrolled at the School of Practical Science) to receive his Bachelor of Applied Science degree in 1913. Thereafter, Smart began to represent his own clients in court, and soon gained prominence as a leading patent and trademark lawyer. By 1913 he was named a partner of the law firm, which began to offer services under the name Fetherstonhaugh & Smart while continuing to be closely associated with the patent agency Fetherstonhaugh & Co. In Ottawa, Smart met the prominent lawyer and politician Harold Fisher, and together they published in 1914 one of the first comprehensive treatises on Canadian patent law.\\"Book Review\\", Transactions of the University of Toronto Engineering Society (1914), Vol. 73, No. 2, p. 2. In 1917, Smart published a treatise on the law of trademarks and designs, which was also one of the first such texts on Canadian law. Smart's litigation practice was extremely busy. He appeared in over 100 reported cases relating to intellectual property, and he regularly visited England to appear before the Privy Council on appeals. By 1926, Smart's legal practice had grown to the extent that he decided it was necessary to bring in an experienced litigator to share his workload. Smart turned to Oliver Mowat Biggar, then the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada, and whom he had previously met as opposing counsel in 1924.Russell v Canada (Commissioner of Patents), [1925] 4 DLR 796, [1925] Ex CR 15. In 1927, the law firm became known as Smart & Biggar, which has continued to this day as a leading intellectual property firm in Canada. Personal life and family Smart's reputation and his successful career firmly placed him in the classes of the nouveau riche, as he and his family began to mingle with members of Ottawa's privileged political and social class beginning in the late 1920s. The Smarts socialized with diplomats, civil servants, lawyers, politicians, and many future literary and cultural figures. Among the Smarts' close friends were Arthur Bourinot, a Canadian lawyer and poet, and Sir Stafford Cripps, a prominent British lawyer and politician who later became Chancellor of the Exchequer. Smart purchased a summer cottage by Lake Kingsmere, in the Gatineau Hills a short drive north of Ottawa on a piece of property adjacent to the vast estates of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King. The Smarts named their cottage \\"The Barge\\" because it was allegedly shaped like the hull of a ship. It was at this summer cottage where Smart's wife, Louie, would play hostess to a number of prominent guests who later became important figures in Canada, including Lester B. Pearson, future Prime Minister of Canada, Charles Ritchie, a civil servant and later a prominent diplomat, Graham Spry, a writer and broadcast pioneer who later helped form the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission and who was an important figure in the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, and Norman Robertson, a diplomat and advisor to Mackenzie King. Smart had four children with Louie. Helen (b. 1909), the eldest, married Alan Swabey in 1931. Swabey was an American football player who played for the McGill Redmen. He was brought into Smart's firm as a patent clerk and later founded his own patent agency in Montreal known as Alan Swabey & Co. Swabey's firm eventually became Swabey Ogilvy Renault (the patent agency associated with Ogilvy Renault), which in turn merged with various firms to form Norton Rose Fulbright Canada. Helen and Alan Swabey later divorced, and she was remarried to Averill Stowell. Elizabeth (b. 1913, also known as \\"Betty\\") was well known as a socialite in Ottawa in her early life, a pursuit encouraged by her mother, but she was later better known as a poet and writer. Her most famous work was her semi-autobiographical poetic novel, By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept, which detailed her romance with the poet George Barker. Jane (b. 1915), known better as Jane Marsh Beveridge, became a sculptor, composer, writer, and filmmaker who was one of the pioneers at the National Film Board of Canada. Russel Jr. (b. 1921), his only son, served overseas in the Canadian Forces during World War II, and later joined Smart & Biggar, eventually taking over as its managing partner. Smart was also a president of the Ottawa Drama League. Late life During World War II, Smart was appointed as the real property administrator for the Wartime Prices and Trade Board. Smart died in Ottawa on May 18, 1944 after a brief illness. His funeral was attended by numerous politicians and civil servants.

A collection of writings, the books detail research during Napoleon's Campaign in Egypt, comprising some of the most foundational scientific research on the Middle East by Western scholars notably in the emerging field of Egyptology. A Paris reprint of the series was released in 1799-1803 (Years VIII-XI) and an English translation of Volume 1 was printed in London on 31 March 1800.  Background  Approximately 160 civilian scholars and scientists (savants), many from the Institut de France, comprised the Commission des Sciences et Arts d'√âgypte. In late August 1798, about a third of them became members of Institut d'Egypte, which was founded in the palace of Hassan-Kashif on the outskirts of Cairo, with Gaspard Monge as president.Louis de Laus de Boisy, \\"The Institute of Egypt,\\" Napoleon: Symbol for an Age, A Brief History with Documents, ed. Rafe Blaufarb (New York: Bedford/St. Martin‚Äôs, 2008), 45-48. The Institute housed a library, laboratories, workshops, and the savants' various Egyptian collections. One of the goals of the Institute was to propagate knowledge. To this end, the savants published the M√©moires, a journal, La Decade Egyptienne, as well as a newspaper, Courier de L'Egypte'.  Organization  The books are not divided neatly into chapters and the only divisions are by the specific piece of research followed by another specific piece of research. Essentially, the books are a collection of primary source documents about living as a researcher through Napoleon's campaign and various pieces of research that were collected from the adventure. Few scholars have written on the organization of the M√©moires, but one who did is the British historian of science George John Singer. In the July 1816 issue of The Eclectic Review, Singer praised the M√©moires for their ground-breaking insights, but expressed great confusion at why the research was organized the way it is and how exactly specific areas were chosen to be comprehensively researched or even investigated at all.  Themes  There are a few patterns among the works. However, these are just generic themes throughout the M√©moires that are not officially organized or even stated by the authors. Furthermore, sometimes writings overlap between the following artificial categories: military reports, geographical discoveries, and colonial subject descriptions. Military reports - in this context - refer to pieces of research that deal with aspects such as weaponry, updates on campaign progress, medical findings, and narratives by army personnel. Examples of these writings include \\"A Report Relative to the Manufacture of the Saltpeter and Gunpowder of Egypt\\" and \\"Account of the Prevailing Ophthalmia of Egypt.\\" The quality of writing various greatly from piece to piece with different authors, likely a sign that some people on the expedition were more academically-inclined towards the liberal arts while others were geared toward the sciences or military. Geographical discoveries refer to research relating to directions, topography, and other aspects at least peripherally related to land or location. A few examples in the book are \\"Observations on the Arabian Horses of the Desert,\\" and \\"Plan of an Agricultural Establishment in Egypt.\\" A trend that re-occurs throughout much of this theme is that many of the pieces were not written in the scientific manner traditionally used in the Western world of today. For instance, \\"Description of the Route from Cairo to Isalehhyeh\\" begins with praise by the French for Egypt's historic success in being a hub for literature in Africa and the Middle East, an introduction quite different from the bland third person narrative of academic jargon that encompasses much contemporary scientific research. The last general theme is the preservation of descriptions of France's colonial subjects in Egypt. A couple of examples of these writings include \\"An Arabian Ode on the Conquest of Egypt\\" and \\"Concerning the Coptic Monasteries\\". However, it is important to note that the writings are written by French scholars and not the colonial subjects themselves. As a result, this opens up the debate regarding whether or not the depictions were fully accurate, a controversy that has existed since the late 1970s called \\"Orientalism.\\" Related text The M√©moires were eventually worked into Description de l'√âgypte (Description of Egypt), an accumulation of various research done during Napoleon's campaign (published in 37 volumes from 1809 to around 1829), along with other research of the period, that would ultimately be presented to the French government in two volumes.

It is a subsidiary of ComfortDelGro Australia. History In 1902, a steam tramway opened in Broken Hill. After this closed in 1926, several bus operators provided unregulated replacement services. This led to fighting between operators and naturally instability. In 1935, a number of bus operators formed the Murton Street bus syndicate resulting in a degree of order in the services.Murton's History Murton's City Bus\\"Murton's Bus Service\\" Fleetline July 1998 pages 111-124 The syndicate was incorporated as a private company in 1945. Up until 1985, the company was owned by a number of private shareholders, who all worked in the business and participated in the management of the business. As well as local bus services, in January 1973 it diversified into interstate coach services with the purchase of the Broken Hill to Adelaide run from Ansett Pioneer. On 5 September 1985, the business was sold to Adelaide-based coach company Briscoes.Broken Hill Electric Traction June 1986 page 95 At the time Briscoes was developing a national express coach service and its interest in acquiring Murtons was primarily to gain control of the Broken Hill to Adelaide service. In February 1986, Briscoes was acquired by Bus Australia who had no interest in the Broken Hill business and in December 1987 sold its interest to the other Murtons shareholders John Hillier, Brian Coucill and Tim Williams. In July 1997, the business was rebranded as Murton‚Äôs City Bus. In 2004, Hillier retired selling his shares to Coucill and Williams.

Early life and stage career Born Astrid Vilhelmine Rasmussen in S√∏nder Bjerge Sogn, Sor√∏ Municipality, Zealand, she was the daughter of hotelier Hans Peter Rasmussen and his wife Maren Sofie Rasmussen (n√©e Larsen). She studied at the Royal Danish Ballet, but left in 1910 to pursue a career as a stage actress. During the World War I years, she performed at Det Ny Teater in the capital city of Copenhagen. During the early 1920s, she was engaged at the Royal Danish Theatre for four seasons by request of theater director Johannes Poulsen. From 1927 to 1940 she was engaged at several theaters throughout Denmark and often left the theater to live abroad. In the early 1940s she was engaged at the Frederiksberg Theatre under direction of Svend Melsing and then the All√©-Scenen Theatre under direction of Svend Rindom. From the mid-1940s she rarely appeared on stage, but occasionally performed in radio theater. Film career Astrid Holm made her screen debut for Dansk Filmfabrik in 1917's S√∏strene Morelli (The Sisters Morelli) and the following year was under contract to Nordisk Film. Her first film for Nordisk was a role in the 1918 Holger-Madsen-directed Folkets Ven (The People's Friend), opposite Gunnar Toln√¶s and Svend Kornbeck. This was followed by several popular films for Emanuel Gregers. One of her most popular roles was as Sister Edith in the 1921 Victor Sj√∂str√∂m-directed Swedish silent K√∂rkarlen (The Phantom Carriage). The film was based on the 1912 novel Thy Soul Shall Bear Witness! by Nobel prize-winning Swedish author Selma Lagerl√∂f. In 1925 she starred opposite Johannes Meyer in the Carl Theodor Dreyer- directed drama Du skal √¶re din hustru (Thou Shalt Honor Thy Wife). This would be Holm's last film role for many years.

It is the largest subspecies, making it the largest living bird. Evolutionary history In the 1990s, mtDNA analyses control region haplotypes revealed that the Arabian ostrich from Western Asia is closely related to the North African ostrich. In 2017, the Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeobotany discovered that common ostriches used to live in India about 25,000 years ago. DNA research on eleven fossilised eggshells from eight archaeological sites in the states of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh found 92% genetic similarity between the eggshells and the North African ostrich. Description The North African ostrich is the largest subspecies of S. camelus, at in height and up to in weight. The neck is pinkish-red, the plumage of males is black and white, and the plumage of females is grey. Habitat and distribution The North African ostrich was widespread from western to northeastern Africa. It used to range from Ethiopia and Sudan in the east throughout the Sahel to Senegal and Mauritania in the west, and north to Egypt and southern Morocco. It has now disappeared from large parts of this range and it only remains in 6 of the 18 countries where it originally occurred. This subspecies may also have occurred in the Sinai Peninsula, where Arabian ostriches once lived. North African ostriches can be found in open fields and the savannahs, especially in the Sahel of Africa. In Israel, the introduced North African ostriches live in grasslands, semi-deserts and plains. Conservation status The North African ostrich had dramatically declined to the point where it is now included on CITES Appendix I and some treat it as Critically Endangered.Sahara Conservation Fund: The North African ostrich is part of a project by the Sahara Conservation Fund (SCF) with the aim of saving the subspecies from extinction and restore its populations in its former ranges in the Sahara and the Sahel. Reintroduction projects A running North African ostrich at Waza National Park, Cameroon. Africa The North African ostrich was the most widespread subspecies of ostrich. It formerly had an extensive range but is now thought to live in fragmented pockets in Cameroon, Chad, Central African Republic and Senegal, whilst extinct in most of its range in northern Africa. Reintroduction projects for the ostriches have begun, especially in northern Sahara, where North African ostriches had been extinct for 50 years. Ostriches were imported from Chad and reintroduced to Souss-Massa National Park in Morocco. In Tunisia, North African ostriches were once common in the southern region of the country. The subspecies had been extirpated since 1887. In 2014, North African ostriches were finally returned to Tunisia after 127 years of being extinct. The birds were first reintroduced to Dghoum√®s National Park. They were then reintroduced to Sidi Toui National Park, and then to Orbata Faunal Reserve. It is planned that the red-necked ostrich will also recover in other countries from western to northeastern Africa, such as Niger and Nigeria. Asia The North African ostrich is the closest relative to the extinct Arabian ostrich from Western Asia. Following analyses of mtDNA control region haplotypes that confirmed the close relationship of the Arabian and the North African subspecies, the North African subspecies was considered suitable for introduction into areas where the Arabian subspecies used to live. In 1988‚Äì89, the ostriches, originally taken from Sudan, were introduced to National Wildlife Research Center in Saudi Arabia. A reintroduction project using the North African ostriches was set up at Mahazat as-Sayd Protected Area in 1994. Currently, it is estimated that 90 to 100 individuals are living within the reserve. It was proposed that the North African ostriches should also reintroduced to Al-Khunfah Protected Area. It also has been reintroduced in the Yotvata Hai-Bar Nature Reserve in Israel as well and some will eventually be released in open fields of the Negev desert. However, the reintroduction failed, as the reintroduced ostriches vanished. The red-necked ostriches were previously found at the Eilat mountains, the Negev desert and the southern Arabah desert. It is thought that the vanished species may have left Israel for Egypt or the Nahal Seifim. The reintroduction project for the ostriches was on hiatus, but the authority might try again in the future. It is hoped that Jordan and Egypt would collaborate with Israel to ensure that the ostriches can live in a broader range.

They have received press coverage in Rolling Stone, The New Yorker and Spin. History Downtown Boys formed after What Cheer? Brigade tubaist Joey La Neve DeFrancesco met vocalist Victoria Ruiz while working at the Renaissance Hotel in Providence, Rhode Island. DeFrancesco famously quit the hotel by handing in his letter of resignation accompanied by his What Cheer? bandmates. The footage of the resignation went viral. In 2014, the band released a 7\\" single on Washington D.C.-based Sister Polygon Records to wide acclaim. Downtown Boys released second LP, Full Communism, on Don Giovanni Records on May 5, 2015. The album's lead single, \\"Monstro\\", drew critical attention from Pitchfork, Stereogum, and the broader music press. Rachel Brodsky of Spin wrote of the single: \\"Bravely combating, as their press release reads, 'the prison-industrial complex, racism, queerphobia, capitalism, fascism, boredom, and all things people use to try to close our minds, eyes and hearts,' Downtown Boys do what their finest punk- rock forefathers did before them: challenge long-held ideas.\\" The group performed on news show Democracy Now! and was interviewed by host Amy Goodman. Rolling Stone featured the group and dubbed them \\"America's Most Exciting Punk Band\\". The New Yorker described the group's live performances, noting that \\"[t]he tracks speed by with hardcore kineticism, but Ruiz‚Äôs lyrics squeeze your hand through the pit: she‚Äôs lucid and blunt, celebrating cops, traders, and any other impediment to justice that she can spot. There‚Äôs something distinctly post-punk about the Boys, ... [i]t could be the saxophone, but it‚Äôs probably the spirit.\\" In 2015, Ruiz and DeFrancesco launched the online magazine Spark Mag in collaboration with grassroots advocacy group Demand Progress. The site aims to feature underground and radical artists and connect fans to organizing work. In 2017, the band released their third LP Cost of Living on Sub Pop Records. The band composed the original music for the biographical film Miss Marx (2020) by Italian director Susanna Nicchiarelli.

Richards (November 3, 1938 - August 23, 2007) was a historian of South Asia and in particular of the Mughal Empire. He was Professor of History at Duke University, North Carolina, and a recipient in 2007 of the Distinguished Contributions to Asian Studies Award. He participated in and encouraged a multi-disciplinary, multi-regional approach to studies.  Life  John Richards was born on November 3, 1938 in Exeter, New Hampshire. His parents, Frank F. Richards and Ella Higgins Richards, subsequently had two more children. Richards graduated from the University of New Hampshire as valedictorian in 1961 and on the same day he married his high school sweetheart, Ann Berry. The couple moved to California and, in 1968, to Madison when he received an appointment at the University of Wisconsin. He was awarded a PhD in History by the University of California at Berkeley in 1970. His thesis, later published at Mughal Administration in Golconda (1975), was written under the direction of Thomas R. Metcalf. This established him as \\"one of the leading historians of the Mughal Empire in the United States\\", according to David Gilmartin, and he went on to write a volume of The New Cambridge History of India titled The Mughal Empire (1993). Other works by Richards on the Mughal period include The Imperial Monetary System of Mughal India (1987) and Kingship and Authority in South Asia (1998). The impact of the Mughal empire on world events caused him to consider the Mughals to be an \\"early modern\\" empire, rather than the medieval one that most commentators believed it to be. It was this belief that led him into studies of world trade and state finances, as well as early modern world environmental history. In 2003, he published The Unending Frontier: Environmental History of the Early Modern World (2003). Richards had worked at Duke University since 1977. He was heavily involved with administration of the Council of American Overseas Research Centers and in reforming the troubled American Institute of Pakistan Studies. He was also in the vanguard of establishing the American Institute of Afghanistan Studies, the first meeting of which took place at Duke University in 2003 and of which he was the founding president. Richards died of cancer at home in Durham, North Carolina, on August 23, 2007, days before he was due to retire. He had two children. A festschrift titled Expanding Frontiers in South Asian and World History: Essays in Honour of John F. Richards was published in 2013, edited by Richard M. Eaton, Munis D. Faruqui, Gilmartin and Sunil Kumar. In 2011, the American Historical Association inaugurated a prize named in his honor. This is awarded for the best book on South Asian history published during each year.

The argument purports to show a distance function approximating Pythagoras' theorem on a discrete space cannot be defined and, since the Pythagorean theorem has been confirmed to be approximately true in nature, physical space is not discrete. While academic debate continues, counterarguments have been proposed in the literature. A demonstration of Weyl's argument proceeds by constructing a rectangular tiling of the plane representing a discrete space. A discretized triangle, n units tall and n units long, can be constructed on the tiling. The hypotenuse of the resulting triangle will be n tiles long. However, by the pythagorean theorem, a corresponding triangle in a continuous space‚Äîa triangle whose height and length are n -- will have a hypotenuse measuring n‚àö2 units long. To show that the former result does not converge to the latter for arbitrary values of n, one can examine the percent difference between the two results: = 1-. Since n cancels out, the two results never converge, even in the limit of large n. The argument can be constructed for more general triangles, but, in each case, the result is the same. Thus, a discrete space does not even approximate the pythagorean theorem. In response, Kris McDaniel has argued the Weyl Tile argument depends on accepting a \\"Size Thesis\\" which posits that the distance between two points is given by the number of tiles between the two points. However, as McDaniel points out, the size thesis is not accepted for continuous spaces. Thus, we might have reason not to accept the size thesis for discrete spaces. Nonetheless, if a discrete space is constructed by a rectangular tiling of the plane and the Size Thesis is accepted, the Euclidean metric will be inappropriate for measuring distances on the resulting space. Instead, the so-called Hamming metric should be utilized. Computer scientists interested in the distance between two strings and mathematical biologists interested in the distance between two genetic sequences employ the versions of the Hamming metric in each of their respective disciplines.

He is also known, more parochially, as 'Moosakakka Keyi' (i.e. the honourable Moosa of the Keyi family). Early years Moosa was born around 1745, probably in Chovva near Kannur. This was the home of his maternal uncle and benefactor, the rich spice merchant, Aluppi, who brought Moosa and his brother, Bappan, to Thalassery to exploit the emerging trade opportunities with the Europeans.A.P. Ummer Kutty, Keyi Charitram, Thalaserry, 1916, pp. 185-208; M.P. Mujeebu Rehiman, 'Merchants and Colonialism: the Case of Chovvakkaran Moosa and the English East India Company', History Farook (working paper series, August 2006), p. 2. Very little is known about Moosa's origins, but he certainly benefitted from his uncle's patronage in his early years. Aluppi sponsored Moosa's first solo business enterprise in Thalassery, which proved to be a disaster. Undaunted, Moosa then sought the support of the Rajah of Travancore, who agreed to give him seed funding for his next venture and to provide a regular supply of teak. Dominating trade on the Malabar Coast Once he had redeemed his financial position, Moosa returned to Thalassery (c. 1780) and eventually took over his uncle's business, supplying rice, pepper (known as ‚ÄòMalabar gold‚Äô) and other goods to the Europeans. Critical to their success, was the family's large mercantile fleet, which included European-built ocean-going vessels.A. Bulley, The Bombay Country Ships, 1790-1833, Abingdon, 2000, pp. 38, 41-48, 51, 72, 77, 93, 283; M.P. Mujeebu Rehiman, ‚ÄòMerchants and Colonialism: the Case of Chovvakkaran Moosa and the English East India Company‚Äô, History Farook (working paper series, August 2006), pp. 2-3. He constructed the Moosakakka Canal to improve shipping. Moosa also fostered a strong network of suppliers throughout Kerala and deployed senior agents in the main commercial centres in India and even as far away as London, Paris and Amsterdam. At about this time, he also became a board member of the Bank of Madras. But the basis of Moosa's success as a businessman seems to have been his reliability in troubled times and the sustained good faith in which he acted with his Indian and British business partners.E.g. Papers of the East India Company, Tellicherry Consultations, 1807, pp. 531-532. The eighteenth-century mercantile profile of Moosa has generated considerable attention. Early economic historians argued that his comprador-like functions vis-√†-vis the Tellicherry establishment (or the 'out-factory' of Tellicherry) as having more or less parasitical relations in the pre-colonial economy. Recently, there was an attempt to locate Moosa's contracting enterprise and its role in the broader context of early-modern capitalism. It is argued that Moosa, along with many of his contemporaries, had a role in economic dispossession. Contracts with the British East India Company Moosa dominated trade in the north of Malabar from about 1783 until the first decade of the 1800s. After the Third Anglo-Mysore War in December 1793, he is listed as the first of five pepper merchants from the northern half of Malabar Province to sign a treaty with the British East India Company, guaranteeing the exclusive supply of all their pepper.W. Logan, A Collection of Treaties, Engagements and Other Papers of Importance, London, 1891, p. 212. By 1800, he dominated the whole of the Malabar coast and held monopoly contracts with the East India Company for most key goods. Eventually, Moosa became so wealthy that he lent money to the East India Company, itself. He was also not afraid to use his connections to get an advantage. When his fleet was barred entry at Cochin in 1796 by the Rajah, he forced the issue, reminding the ruler of his exceptional influence with the British. The Rajah backed down. On other occasions, he threatened adversaries with the possibility that his interests might even be backed up with British military muscle.A.P. Ummer Kutty, Keyi Charitram, Thalassery, 1916, p. 192;A. Bulley, The Bombay Country Ships, 1790-1833, Abingdon, 2000, p. 42; M.P. Mujeebu Rehiman, ‚ÄòMerchants and Colonialism: the Case of Chovvakkaran Moosa and the English East India Company‚Äô, History Farook (working paper series, August 2006), pp. 4-7. Relationship with Indian rulers Tipu Sultan of the Mysore Kingdom When Tipu Sultan seized Malabar in 1786, he coveted the valuable mercantile interests of Moosa and other merchants of the region, but he also realised that they were central to Malabar's ongoing prosperity. Moosa was warned by friends, who were close to Tipu Sultan, that his assets were in danger of being seized and that he should flee Thalassery. Nevertheless, Moosa and the other principal merchants remained, where they thought they were best able to protect their interests and, albeit to a diminished level, continue trading with the Europeans. They remained until the conclusion of the Third Anglo- Mysore War in 1792.M.P. Mujeebu Rehiman, ‚ÄòMerchants and Colonialism: the Case of Chovvakkaran Moosa and the English East India Company‚Äô, History Farook (working paper series, August 2006), pp. 8-10. After the British were reestablished in the area, Moosa benefited from the declining fortunes of local aristocracies and the difficulties they faced in the changing landscape of British rule. For example, he was the mortgagee of valuable coir assets owned by Junumabe, the Bibi of Arakkal and her family on the Lakshadweep Islands.A.P. Ummer Kutty, Keyi Charitram, Thalassery, 1916, pp. 106-107. Moosa, a Moghul, also indirectly benefited from the British suppression of Hindu rule in Malabar, as cultural imperatives had, at times, been an impediment with certain non-Muslims.M.P. Mujeebu Rehiman, ‚ÄòMerchants and Colonialism: the Case of Chovvakkaran Moosa and the English East India Company‚Äô, History Farook (working paper series, August 2006), p. 10. Relationship with the British Although Moosa was considered by the East India Company to be one of its most important Indian allies, Moosa did have difficulty in his relationships with certain senior British figures. He came into conflict with British entrepreneur, Murdoch Brown. Moosa took Brown to court for debt and won, even being able to rely on the testimony of British officials in his defence. Nevertheless, in 1799, Brown was appointed the leading British official in Thalassery and Moosa had to be careful with his adversary in control.M.P. Mujeebu Rehiman, ‚ÄòMerchants and Colonialism: the Case of Chovvakkaran Moosa and the English East India Company‚Äô, History Farook (working paper series, August 2006), p. 8.Major-General Arthur Wellesley in India, 1804. Later, the Duke of Wellington. Moosa also had the distinction of having angered Arthur Wellesley, who became the Duke of Wellington, for his efforts to support his suppliers (many of them, rebels) whilst also juggling commitments to the British authorities. Wellington, whose elder brother Richard was Governor-General, wrote to Colonel Sartorius in 1800 suggesting that Moosa be executed for his dealings with the rebels. :There is a fellow, by the name of Mousa, at Tellicherry who supplies the Rajah with rice, to my certain knowledge. A hint might be given to him that I am in the habit of hanging those whom I find living under the protection of the Company and dealing treacherously towards their interests; that I spare neither rank nor riches; but that, on the contrary, I punish severely those who by their example create the evils for which the unfortunate people suffer.A. Wellesley, The Dispatches of Field Marshall the Duke of Wellington, vol. 2, Cambridge, 1844, pp. 1615-1617. The passage was even quoted in full and out of context in the Sydney Morning Herald (25 March 1845, p. 2) as an example of Wellington‚Äôs 'character'. Wellington seems to have had little grasp of Indian affairs and the complex considerations at play in servicing the lucrative pepper contracts. On the other hand, the Company officials would have understood that Moosa held a virtual monopoly of supply and, therefore, was obliged to negotiate with the rebels, who held much of the pepper territory. Morevoer, there were hostile foreign traders poised to take advantage. Wellington's advice was ignored.M.P. Mujeebu Rehiman, ‚ÄòMerchants and Colonialism: the Case of Chovvakkaran Moosa and the English East India Company‚Äô, History Farook (working paper series, August 2006), pp. 10-11. Moosa, was consistently pro- British when dealing with Indian leaders. On occasion, he is reported as going so far as to describe the East India Company to fellow Keralites as ‚Äòour own company‚Äô.A. Bulley, The Bombay Country Ships, 1790-1833, Abingdon, 2000, p. 42. He also seems to have sought to strengthen his connections with the British through marriage. One of his daughters, Mussooruat Sauer Nhaunus, married William Tippet, Magistrate of Patna (c. 1798).Will of W.H. Tippet in the UK National Archives; J.

Final Years In the early 1800s, Moosa's fortune, fleet and mercantile interests continued to grow. He died in 1807, one of Malabar's most wealthy and influential figures. He is interred in a mausoleum in the Odathil Palli mosque, which he built sometime before 1806. The Keyi family continued to enjoy its good fortune. In 1813, Moosa's son and main heir was described as ‚Äòthe richest man on the Malabar Coast‚Äô.W. Milburn, Oriental Commerce, vol. 1, London, 1813, p. 322; cf. p. 329. However, Milburn may have been referring, posthumously, to Moosa, himself. The Moosa family, which is still prominent in Thalassery, runs a nineteenth-century guest house, which, it is claimed, once belonged to their ancestor's bitter rival, Murdoch Brown.

An early supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement, he has been active in the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore, Maryland and on social media outlets such as Twitter and Instagram. Mckesson has also written for HuffPost and The Guardian. Along with Johnetta Elzie, Brittany Packnett, and Samuel Sinyangwe, Mckesson launched Campaign Zero, a policy platform to end police violence. He is currently part of Crooked Media and hosts Pod Save the People. On February 3, 2016, Mckesson announced his candidacy in the 2016 Baltimore mayoral election. He finished with 3,445 votes (2.6%) placing sixth in the Democratic Party primary on April 26. Mckesson is the author of On the Other Side of Freedom: The Case for Hope, a memoir about his life and time as a Black Lives Matter organizer. Early life, education, and career Mckesson was an organizer in Baltimore City as a teenager, notably as the Chairman of Youth As Resources, Baltimore's youth-led grant-making organization. He attended Catonsville High School where he graduated in 2003. He then went on to Bowdoin College, where he had been president of the student government and his class and graduated in 2007 with a degree in government and legal studies. After graduation Mckesson began his education career by working for Teach for America for two years in a New York City elementary school. Mckesson later worked as special assistant in the office of human capital with the Baltimore City Public Schools, for the Harlem's Children's Zone, and as a human resources official at Minneapolis Public Schools. In June 2016, he was appointed Baltimore City Schools' interim chief human capital officer, i.e., chief personnel officer, by district CEO Sonja Santelises. He has been criticized by some public education advocates for his involvement in Teach for America and for his support for charter schools.  Activism and politics  Mckesson first drove from Minneapolis to Ferguson on August 16, 2014. He began spending all his weekends and vacations in St. Louis. On March 4, 2015, Mckesson announced via Twitter that he had quit his job at Minneapolis Public Schools and had moved to St. Louis. In April 2015, Mckesson and fellow activists Johnetta Elzie, Samuel Sinyangwe, and Brittany Packnett launched \\"Mapping Police Violence\\", which collected data on people killed by police during 2014. In August 2015, the same group launched Campaign Zero, a ten-point policy plan for police reform. Key points included the decriminalization of trespassing, marijuana possession, loitering, public disturbance, and consuming alcohol in public as these crimes do not threaten public safety, but are often used to target African Americans. Mckesson and Elzie were awarded the Howard Zinn Freedom to Write Award in 2015 for their activism. Mckesson in 2019 In June 2015, Mckesson was the focus of a Twitter campaign while he was in Charleston, South Carolina to protest the Charleston church shooting. The campaign featured the hashtag \\"#GoHomeDeray\\", which was accompanied by statements demanding that Mckesson leave the city. Mckesson responded to the hashtag, stating that he was there as a sign of solidarity for the nine deaths and that the hashtag was proof that \\"[r]acism is alive and well in places like South Carolina, and in towns across America.\\" Mckesson's Twitter account was later hacked in 2016. In late 2015, he was a guest lecturer at Yale Divinity School. In November of the same year, Mckesson spoke at the GLAAD Gala, where he discussed his life as a gay man and asked LGBT people to \\"come out of the quiet.\\" In February 2016, Mckesson announced his candidacy for Mayor of Baltimore just before the filing deadline. He placed 6th in the city's Democratic primary in April, with 2.5% of the vote. In June 2016, he was named as interim chief human capital officer of the Baltimore City Public School System. On July 9, 2016, in the aftermath of the shooting of Alton Sterling, Mckesson took part in a protest in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. While live streaming, he was arrested. He was released the next day after being charged with obstruction of a roadway, and charges were later dropped. On July 13, he and other Black Lives Matter activists, along with police officials, politicians, and other activists, met with President Obama at the White House to discuss relations between black communities and law enforcement officials. In 2016, Mckesson appeared on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert to have a dialogue about race and education. Mckesson voted for Bernie Sanders in the primary of the 2016 election, and voted for Hillary Clinton in the general election. In 2017, Mckesson launched the Pod Save the People podcast, discussing news, culture, social justice, and politics with co-hosts Brittany Packnett Cunningham, Samuel Sinyangwe, Dr. Clint Smith, and guests. In July 2017, Mckesson and Black Lives Matter were sued by a Baton Rouge policeman who sustained life-altering injuries in an ambush attack, claiming that Black Lives Matter \\"incited the violence against police in retaliation for the death (sic) of black men shot by police\\". The suit was dismissed in October 2017; U.S. District Judge Brian Jackson‚Äôs ruling stated that the officer \\"utterly failed to state a plausible claim\\" and instead launched a \\"confused attack\\" against Black Lives Matter and others. On the same day U.S. District Judge John W. deGravelles approved a settlement awarding up to $1,000 to protesters, including Mckesson, who claim police used excessive force in arresting them. However on April 24, 2019 the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Jackson's ruling, allowing the suit to go forward. The ruling stated that: \\"Given the intentional lawlessness of this aspect of the demonstration, Mckesson should have known that leading the demonstrators onto a busy highway was most nearly certain to provoke a confrontation between police and the mass of demonstrators, and not withstanding, did so anyway. By ignoring the foreseeable risk of violence that his actions created, Mckesson failed to exercise reasonable care in conducting his demonstration.\\" As of October 25, 2019, there is a portrait of Mckesson hanging in the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery.https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/deray-mckesson-quinn-russell- brown/4QFb3rg0fqZwxA In April 2020, McKesson tested positive for COVID-19.

The story is set in the summer of 1949 in southwestern North Carolina. It follows the romance between Danny MacGregor, a hillbilly music singer, and Cissy Timberlake, a folk-music scholar and former singer. The novel's principal theme is the conflict between tradition and commercial prospects. Davidson was best known as a poet and The Big Ballad Jamboree was his only novel. Reception Publishers Weekly's critic wrote: \\"the novel places a comic spin on the serious subject that Davidson explored as a Fugitive poet and Agrarian essayist: how urbanization can wreak havoc on rural society and the folk arts. ...

It was written and designed by Hideo Kojima and first released in 1988 for the PC-8801 and MSX2 in Japan. Snatcher is set in a future East Asian metropolis where humanoid robots dubbed \\"Snatchers\\" have been discovered killing humans and replacing them in society. The game follows an amnesiac member, who joins a Snatcher hunting agency in search of his past. Gameplay takes place primarily through a menu-based interface through which the player can choose to examine items, search rooms, speak to characters, explore a semi-open world, and perform other actions. Kojima wanted Snatcher to have a cinematic feel, so the setting and story are heavily influenced by science fiction films, like Blade Runner, Akira and The Terminator. Development on the PC versions took more than twice as long as the average game of the time, even after Kojima was asked to trim more than half his initial story. The game was released to positive reviews, but poor sales. It garnered a cult following, and was remade as a role-playing game called SD Snatcher for the MSX2 in 1990. This was followed by a remake of the original adventure game using CD-ROM technology, released for the PC Engine Super CD-ROM¬≤ System in 1992. Looking to provide a more interactive experience to gamers in the West, Konami developed a Sega CD version of Snatcher specifically for North America and Europe in 1994. Although it too was released to a poor commercial reception, the Sega CD version received mostly positive reviews for its cinematic presentation and mature themes uncommon in games at the time. Snatcher has been retrospectively acclaimed as both one of the best adventure and cyberpunk games of all time, and identified as a foundation for the themes Kojima explored later in the Metal Gear series. The game was a significant inspiration on Goichi Suda, who worked with Kojima to produce a radio drama prequel, Sdatcher. The English version of Snatcher has never been rereleased, despite desire from fans. Gameplay alt=Game screenshot. The top half of the screen has an image of a young girl standing in a room looking at the player. She has blue hair and a pink outfit. The bottom half of the screen has options for the player including options like \\"Move, Look, Investigate, and Ask\\" Snatcher is a graphic adventure game with visual novel elements. The player controls Gillian Seed as he investigates and hunts \\"Snatchers\\", dangerous humanoid robots disguised as humans roaming Neo Kobe City. The game's visuals are static images with some animations that display at the top of the screen. There is no point-and-click interface, with all actions made through a text menu with commands such as move, look, and investigate. The game's puzzles and dialogue trees are simple, lending to an emphasis on linear storytelling. Sometimes character panels are shown below the main graphics window during conversations to convey their facial expressions. The game allows exploration of a semi-open world. There are a handful of action segments where the player shoots at enemies dispersed across a 3x3 grid. The Sega CD version supports the Justifier light gun packaged with Lethal Enforcers for these segments. Plot Snatcher is set in the mid-21st century, fifty years after a biological weapon known as Lucifer-Alpha killed much of the world's population. In Neo Kobe City, a metropolis on an artificial island in eastern Asia, humanoid robots dubbed \\"Snatchers\\" have been recently discovered killing humans, donning their skin as a disguise, and replacing them in society. The Neo Kobe government closes the city from the outside world and establishes JUNKER, a task force to hunt Snatchers. The player takes on the role of Gillian Seed (Yusaku Yara/Jeff Lupetin), an amnesiac who can only remember that his past, along with that of his estranged wife Jamie (Kikuko Inoue/Susan Mele), is somehow related to Snatchers. He starts working at JUNKER in hopes that hunting Snatchers will bring his past to light. After arriving at the JUNKER headquarters, Gillian Seed meets Mika Slayton (Miina Tominaga/Kimberly Harne) and Chief Benson Cunningham (Gor≈ç Naya/Ray Van Steen), and receives a robot navigator named \\"Metal Gear Mk. II\\" (Mami Koyama/Lucy Childs) from JUNKER's engineer Harry Benson (Ry≈´ji Saikachi/Ray Van Steen). Metal Gear receives a distress call from Jean-Jack Gibson (Isao Inoguchi/Jim Parks), the only other JUNKER agent, so Gillian travels there with Metal Gear, only to find a pair of Snatchers have killed him. They try to pursue the Snatchers, but are forced to make a quick escape as the factory explodes. Gillian begins searching for the identity of the Snatchers that murdered Jean-Jack, and after searching his house with the help of his daughter Katrina (Miina Tominaga/Lynn Foosaner) and speaking with his informant \\"Napoleon\\" (Gor≈ç Naya/Jim Parks), Gillian identifies a pair of suspects. When hunting down the Snatchers, he is nearly killed but is saved by Random Hajile (Kaneto Shiozawa/Ray Van Steen), a Snatcher bounty hunter. Random joins Gillian and Metal Gear as they travel to a hospital Jean-Jack identified as suspicious during his investigation. They learn it has been abandoned for several years and harbors a secret basement where they find skeletons of Snatcher victims. Among them, they find Chief Cunningham, meaning the JUNKER chief is a Snatcher. Some Snatchers attack the group, but Random distracts them to allow Gillian and Metal Gear to escape. Back at JUNKER headquarters, Gillian speaks to Harry briefly before he dies, having been mortally wounded by the Chief, and kills the Chief after Mika is taken hostage. Immediately after this, Gillian receives a call from Jamie, telling him she has regained her memories and is being held in the \\"Kremlin\\". Gillian and Metal Gear travel to an abandoned church resembling the Kremlin, where they find Jamie being held captive by a scientist named Elijah Modnar (Kaneto Shiozawa/Ray Van Steen), who explains Gillian's past. He, his father and Jamie were involved in a secret experiment undertaken by the Soviet Union over 50 years prior during the Cold War to create Snatchers, which were designed to kill and replace world leaders, giving the Soviets more power. Gillian was a CIA agent spying on the project, who married Jamie and had a child with her, Harry Benson. Gillian and Jamie were placed in a cryogenic sleep when Elijah released Lucifer-Alpha into the atmosphere. The pair were saved by the army, and lost their memories due to the extended period of time they had been frozen. Having become corrupt with power, Elijah reveals that he intends for the Snatchers to wipe out and replace humanity as proof of mankind's follies; he also reveals that Random was an anti-Snatcher created by his late father based on Elijah's appearance and memories, and presents his deactivated body. At this point, Random reactivates and holds Elijah at bay, allowing Gillian and Jamie to escape. Metal Gear activates an orbital weapon, which destroys the Snatcher base, killing Elijah and Random. Having learned of a larger Snatcher factory in Moscow, Gillian prepares to embark on a mission there, hoping to destroy the menace and rekindle his marriage with Jamie.  Development and release   PC-8801 and MSX2  alt=A still frame from the film Blade Runner. A flying car flies between skyscrapers in a futuristic looking city. The buildings are covered with lights and advertising video billboards. Snatcher was created by Hideo Kojima, working for Konami. Heavily influenced by Blade Runner (1982) and other works of cinema, he wanted to develop a game with a similar style. The game was pitched as a \\"cyberpunk adventure\\". Kojima found it difficult to explain the meaning of \\"cyberpunk\\" to Konami's trademark department over the phone. The game was originally titled Junker, but the name sounded too similar to an existing mahjong game. The title New Order was also considered. Kojima did not like the final name because his previous game, Metal Gear (1987), was also named after an enemy in the game. Development began between Kojima and character designer Tomiharu Kinoshita, who both treated the project like making a film or anime rather than a game. They expanded to form a small team at Konami, about half the size needed for a typical Famicom game, which allowed them to work closely and quickly. The game is filled with science fiction culture references that skirt copyright laws. Kojima told Kinoshita to make Gillian similar to Katsuhiro Otomo, director of the science fiction film Akira (1988). The team never aimed for the game to have a mature atmosphere, but it naturally progressed in that direction. In addition to fourth wall breaking dialogue in the game, Kojima wanted to print a secret message and heat-activated scent on the floppy disks that could be noticed after warming them up in the disk drive, but Konami did not approve of this idea. After a year and a half, Snatcher was only half completed. Originally Kojima planned six chapters, but was told to trim them down to two. The team wanted to create a third chapter, but were already over the allowed development schedule so were forced to end the game on a cliffhanger. Development took about two to three times longer than the average game. Difficulties with memory constraints prompted the staff to take a break during development, at which time Kojima began to explore concepts for his later game Policenauts (1994). (Translation ) Originally Snatcher was going to be a PC-8801 exclusive, but it was also developed for the MSX2 at the request of Konami. The PC-8801 version supports FM and stereo sounds via the PC-8801's Sound Board II expansion card while the MSX2 version came with a special cartridge that provided an expanded soundscape beyond the platform's default capabilities and extra RAM, featuring different music track arrangements. The expansion cartridge raised the price of the MSX2 version beyond that of the PC-8801 version, a reverse from the platform's typically cheaper retail game pricing. The quantity of music and sound was greater than other games at the time, and required a larger than usual sound team. Because neither platform was capable of accurately synthesizing speech, sound effects were used to represent character dialogue. Snatcher was released for the PC-8801 on November 26, 1988, and the MSX2 in December that year.  PC Engine  alt=Two screenshots are shown. The stop image shows a dead robot woman with her dress ripped exposing her breasts. The bottom image is the same scene but her dress is not ripped. Players began asking for a home console version soon after release. Because the game was large and required several floppy disks, only CD-ROM systems were considered as opposed to systems that ran ROM cartridges. The PC Engine had the Super CD-ROM¬≤ System available so it was chosen to host Snatcher's console port. This port was the first time the development team worked with CD technology. The team added a third act to this version, a decision they were criticized internally for as others believed the game was already long enough. Using CD technology enabled them to add recorded speech and high quality background music. Artist Satoshi Yoshioka created the graphics for this version. Kojima wanted the visuals to appear as \\"cinematic\\" as possible, so Yoshioka pulled inspiration from Blade Runner, The Terminator (1984), and Alien (1979) to replicate their Hollywood-style special effects. He used a custom drawing application by Konami to create the character graphics, including the facial expressions during conversations. He found Gillian's expressions to be the most difficult to animate due to the complexities of his characterization. A trial version called the Pilot Disk was released on August 7, 1992. It covers the beginning of the first act and also contains supplemental content such as character introductions, a preview trailer, and select music tracks. The full version was released on October 23, 1992 and reportedly sold well for a PC Engine game.  Sega CD  After releasing its first game on the Sega CD, Lethal Enforcers (1992), Konami wanted to bring a more interactive experience to the system for Western players. It considered making a game in full motion video like Night Trap (1992) but thought it may be too difficult, and ultimately decided to localize and port Snatcher. This also gave the Snatcher developers an opportunity to improve upon the PC Engine version which they were still not completely satisfied with. Although the Sega CD could only display 64 colors simultaneously (compared to the PC Engine's 256), the team used software techniques to increase this to 112 and modified some of the palettes to compromise. Several scenes were censored or otherwise altered for the Sega CD release. A female Snatcher's breasts were covered up, while the sequence in which Katrina Gibson is shown standing naked in a shower was obscured, and Katrina's age was changed from 14 to 18. Some options that allowed Gillian to engage in sexual behaviors were removed or toned down, such as those that allowed him to sniff panties or stare at breasts. Audio in which a robot becomes aroused while watching a pornographic film was cut out entirely. The violence was not altered, except for one scene where a partially dead dog with twitching innards was made completely dead with no twitching. Fearing copyright issues in the United States, the clientele in a bar was changed from Kamen Rider, the Alien, and other characters to Konami characters. Feeling that the third act was too movie-like, Konami added more interactivity through additional forks and choices. Additionally, the player is now graded on how well they solved the mysteries. Dates of events in the game were also moved up five years to still occur in the near future to compensate for the late release. The game was translated by Scott Hards, with supervision from Jeremy Blaustein and Konami of Japan. The translation took about two to three months. Seven voice actors recorded about two and a half hours of dialogue for 26 different characters. With the large amount of text included in the game, the translation was expensive, and Konami felt it was the most difficult part of the porting process. According to Blaustein, Kojima was not involved with the Sega CD port, likely working on Policenauts at the time. Snatcher was released in December 1994 in Europe and January 1995 in North America. According to Blaustein, it only sold a couple thousand copies in the United States and was ultimately a commercial failure. Its poor sales have been attributed to its late release during the Sega CD's lifespan. PlayStation and Sega Saturn  Snatcher was released once again in Japan in 1996, this time for 32-bit game consoles. A PlayStation version was released on January 26, followed by a Sega Saturn version on March 29. Reception The PC-8801 and MSX2 versions received positive reviews in Japan and attained a cult following, but were not commercially successful. The PC Engine version also attained a following in Japan in part because of its gore. Famicom Tsushin gave it a 33 out of 40, commending its cinematic quality. The game was still listed on its \\"Reader's Best 20\\" list two years after release. Sega Saturn Magazine found the Sega Saturn version a faithful port of the PC Engine version. When Snatcher arrived to the west on the Sega CD, it received praise for its story, cinematic presentation, and mature themes. It was more cinematic and told a more mature story than gamers were familiar with at the time. Mean Machines Sega felt Snatcher was more substantial than other adventure games, calling it \\"one of the most involved storyboards and backgrounds of any video game\\". The game's writing was generally lauded, but VideoGames and Game Players felt its juvenile humor sometimes conflicted from its otherwise serious tone. A reviewer at GameFan called it \\"one of the longest, most involving games\\" he had played in a long time. He wrote: \\"Never before have I played ‚Äì nay experienced ‚Äì a game this moving, dramatic, gore-riddled, MA-17, adult\\". The magazine praised Konami for retaining most of the mature content. Mean Machines Sega believed Snatcher's presentation was heightened through the use of CD-ROM technology, which supported the digitized voices and high quality graphics. Some critics praised the English voice acting and writing, though Next Generation thought Konami could have contracted better actors. The graphics were criticized by Computer and Video Games as \\"dated\\" and VideoGames as \\"generic\\". Other magazines discussed the graphics in more positive light. GamePro liked the Japanese anime style graphics and felt that combined with the writing, it drew players into the story. However, its reviewer criticized the music, calling it \\"old-fashioned for a cyberpunk adventure\\", while Mean Machines Sega compared it positively to John Carpenter-style incidental themes. Critics felt the game was slow moving at times, but rewarded patient players. GamePro wrote that it rewards \\"patience, persistence, and plodding\\". Ultimate Future Games felt the game was too linear, and leaned too heavily on the illusion of choice when the story could only be advanced by completing tasks in a certain order. Mean Machines Sega felt the puzzles were challenging and the game was considerably longer and more substantial than Rise of the Dragon (1990), another cyberpunk adventure game. Computer and Video Games felt the gun shooting sections were weak and disappointing.  Retrospective  Snatcher has been called one of the best adventure games and best cyberpunk games of all time. In 1997 Electronic Gaming Monthly ranked the Sega CD version the 69th best console video game of all time on the sole basis of the game's story content, remarking that \\"not many people have played it, but almost everyone knows of its grisly story line.\\" Note: The intro to the article (on page 100) explicitly states that the list covers console video games only and U.S. releases only, so only the Sega CD version was eligible. It has continued to receive praise for its story and presentation. Waypoint wrote that its narrative and visuals hold up, in contrast to most Sega CD and cyberpunk adventure games. Kotaku called it a \\"science fiction cornucopia\\" and liked how the game explored topics of human existence and the fear of machines replacing humans. It felt the game was heavily influenced by science fiction films including Blade Runner, The Terminator, Akira, and Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956). Other publications also picked up on these inspirations, especially that from Blade Runner. Retro Gamer felt it was ironic how the game was more cinematic than games using full motion video. Destructoid enjoyed the plot, but complained about the interface. AllGame wrote that text-based menu driven games like Snatcher can become tedious, but felt the storyline and graphics made Snatcher worth its time.  Legacy  alt=An asian man stands stoically looking at the camera. Critics have discussed Snatcher as setting the stage for Kojima's later works. 1UP.com felt the game demonstrated his love for film and was \\"more of a cerebral affair than some of [his] other efforts, but his ingenuity and attention to detail helped make this game especially noteworthy\\". Game Informer wrote that Snatcher foreshadowed Kojima's use of science fiction to explore philosophy, sex, and the human condition in Metal Gear Solid. Snatcher remains one of Kojima's most renowned games, but is often overshadowed by the Metal Gear Solid series. The game has obtained a cult following. It has been an influence on other science fiction works, including Project Itoh's novel Genocidal Organ, and the 2015 adventure game 2064: Read Only Memories. Kojima has expressed interest in reviving Snatcher in some capacity, and has explained he does not have the time to work on the project himself but would welcome another director to lead it. According to him, such a project has never been feasible from a business perspective, and in 2011, said that a sequel would need to sell over half a million copies to make sense financially. Kojima left Konami in 2015, and the game remains a property of the company, which has not expressed interest in reviving it, either through a rerelease or sequel. The game's lack of availability on modern platforms has surprised critics. Some believed it would play well on a Nintendo DS or 3DS, following the footsteps of successful graphic adventures on those platforms like Hotel Dusk and Phoenix Wright. The Sega CD version remains the sole release in Western territories. Demand has driven up the prices on these copies on the secondary market, making emulation a more reasonable option for most players. Japanese copies are far cheaper but the game's text-based nature makes it difficult for non-Japanese readers. The PC Engine version is included in the TurboGrafx-16 Mini, but only in the original Japanese. Fans have experimented with porting the game to other systems. A demo of an early part of the game was made for the Virtual Boy in 2015, complete with stereoscopic 3D effects and PCM music. Another fan experimented with porting it to the Dreamcast with a remixed soundtrack and retouched visuals. Snatcher was the first translation project for Jeremy Blaustein, who went on to translate Kojima's Metal Gear Solid (1998). Blaustein launched a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter for a steampunk adventure game titled Blackmore in 2014. The game was to be directed by Blaustein with former Snatcher staff making up other parts of the team. It did not meet its funding goal. SD Snatcher Snatcher was remade into a role- playing game called SD Snatcher for the MSX2, released in 1990. \\"SD\\" stands for \\"super deformed\\" in Japanese media, another way to reference chibi character designs. The game plays from a top-down perspective, where the player controls Gillian as he ventures through the environment. When the player encounters an enemy on the field, the game shifts to a first-person battle mode. The player must shoot down enemies using one of many different guns. Different parts of an enemy can be targeted and different weapons have varying abilities and ranges. Outside of key plot points, the game significantly changes the locations explored and events which transpired in the original. This game also concludes the story in a similar manner to the CD-ROM versions. Like the MSX2 version of Snatcher, SD Snatcher shipped with the expanded sound cartridge. It was translated by the Dutch-based group Oasis in 1993, making it one of the earliest documented fan translations. Sdatcher An episodic radio drama prequel, Sdatcher, was released in 2011 through a collaboration between Kojima and game designer Goichi Suda. Suda credited Snatcher, along with works by Yu Suzuki, for igniting his interest in video games. He asked Kojima if he wanted to make a new game together, and the project lead to a radio drama. It was announced in 2007. The script was written by Suda, and the music was composed by Akira Yamaoka, who worked for Suda in his Grasshopper Manufacture studio and worked on the Silent Hill series. Original Snatcher artist Satoshi Yoshioka did promotional illustrations. The first act was released in September with new acts released every other week through November that year. It was distributed for free and later sold on CDs. It was later translated by fans.

Dachauski procesi. Enciklopedija Slovenije, vol. 2, p. 167. Ljubljana: Mladinska knjiga.) were a group of show trials held between 1947 and 1949 in FPR Yugoslavia, mostly in PR Slovenia. The name refers to the fact that 31 of the defendants had been prisoners at the Dachau concentration camp.Neƒçak, Du≈°an. 1999. Dachauski procesi 1947‚Äì1949. Kronika 57: 533‚Äì542. Thirty seven people were sentenced, 15 of them to death, 10 of whom were executed. All sentences were reversed in April 1986.  Background and procedure  The trials marked a departure from previous communist show trials in Slovenia such as the Nagode Trial because until this point the authorities had sought enemies outside the Communist Party, among the non-proletariat and the non-communist intelligentsia. By selecting enemies from the ranks of the Communist Party, a Yugoslav version of the Stalinist show trials was launched. In the preparations for the trials, a large number of writers, physicians, politicians, and engineers were arrested without knowing whether they would be accused or merely used as witnesses.Repe, Bo≈æo. 1999. Politiƒçni sodni proces. Enciklopedija Slovenije, vol. 9, pp. 94‚Äì99. Ljubljana: Mladinska knjiga, p. 98. Those arrested were tortured and deprived of their legal rights. Forged documents were prepared as evidence against them and false testimony was prepared. The defendants in the trials were forced to confess to being Nazi spies while imprisoned at the Dachau concentration camp, collaborating with the Gestapo, and working for Western powers after the Second World War in order to undermine socialism.Job, Cvijeto. 2002.

Owen and April go overseas for what was an original 3-month, military surgical training program, but April keeps extending her leave despite Jackson‚Äôs pleas for her to come home. Jackson and Jo work on a pair of burn victims who bond over their circumstances and the loss of a bad boyfriend. Almost a year passes since Meredith took off, but Alex finally receives a call from Meredith telling him everyone‚Äôs fine and to stop calling. In Ellis-like fashion, Meredith, who has run away, is very pregnant, but she's the only one who knows. Callie continues to work with Dan after she had to amputate his leg. During therapy, she helps him learn to walk with one of her robotic limbs that she fondly remembers she created with Derek. Amelia has an emotional breakdown at the hospital, which leads to her buying drugs. Owen finds her at Meredith and Derek‚Äôs house, where she is seriously thinking about taking the drugs. Owen is able to coax her out of it, and Amelia confronts her feelings head-on and without drugs for the first time since the death of her baby. On Valentine‚Äôs Day, Ben shows Bailey that it's in his will that if something happens, he wants to be unplugged like Bailey; however, Bailey doesn't like this new decision of his, as she had just learned to accept his wanting to live at all costs. April surprises Jackson by returning from her military leave with no warning, and Catherine comes around and proposes‚Äîin front of the whole hospital‚Äîto Richard, who accepts with passion. The parallels between Meredith and her mother, Ellis, continue as Meredith begins to bleed in the kitchen. Holding her stomach, she tells Zola to dial 9-1-1. Just as Meredith saved Ellis‚Äô life, Zola saved Meredith‚Äôs. Meredith delivers a healthy baby girl, who she names Ellis. To Meredith‚Äôs surprise, Alex shows up at the hospital because he was listed as her emergency contact person. They all return to Seattle, where she finally decides that she must move on and start over.

Reviews The reviews for She's Leaving Home were hugely mixed with the critics majorly criticizing the writing and the lack of emphasis on the death of Derek Shepherd but praising the performance of the majority of the cast. Entertainment Weekly criticized the lack of screen time for Pompeo and lack of emphasis on the death of the show's male lead stating, \\"The two-hour episode, very rarely touched on Derek, actually, it rarely touched on anything of great importance‚Äîhell, we barely saw Meredith.\\" However, acknowledging Pompeo's absence the site wrote, \\"I get that her absence helped make the episode conclusion stronger, Meredith‚Äôs quiet examination of Derek‚Äôs belongings powerfully describes his absence, and powerfully explains why she had to leave, but still: Could we at least have gotten just a little more time with her?\\" The site summed up the episode by writing, \\"Like the episode before it, this one wasn‚Äôt particularly good. It was unevenly paced and didn‚Äôt focus enough on the parts that truly mattered. But when it succeeded, it really succeeded: Amelia‚Äôs scene with Owen and Meredith‚Äôs homecoming were both examples of Grey‚Äôs at its honest, raw best. They weren‚Äôt enough to make up for Derek Shepherd‚Äôs departure‚Äîbut then again, is anything enough to make up for that?\\" The development of Justin Chambers' character was praised by the critics. TV Equals gave a mixed review for the episode stating, \\"The episode was definitely a mixed bag for me, I‚Äôm still not sure how I feel about last night‚Äôs two-hour farewell,\\" criticizing the lack of screen time for Derek's funeral. \\"You know what we did not get a lot of? Outward acts of mourning or grieving. Had this been a typical hour-long episode, the very minimal time spent on Derek‚Äôs funeral or hearing Derek‚Äôs loved ones and colleagues reflect on his life is much more noticeable,\\" adding, \\"The subplot with ladies in the burn unit was an unexpected, yet pleasant surprise. It was a much more natural extension of the episode‚Äôs theme of not choosing to be alone. The writers were clearly trying to do the same with Richard and Catherine, but I found the material with the women in the burn unit to be much more heartfelt.\\" The site added, \\"It was good to see her not choose to be alone in the end. That was a much more entertaining choice than simply having her spend nearly two hours crying or staring longingly at Derek‚Äôs side of the bed,\\" and praised Justin Chambers' character: \\"I liked Alex‚Äôs determination to be Meredith‚Äôs ‚Äúperson‚Äù and Meredith finally welcoming her person back into her life when she gave birth to Ellis,\\" and added, \\"The more I see them interact, the more I love the dynamic between Maggie and Alex.\\" Praising Sara Ramirez's performance the site wrote, \\"Callie‚Äôs reflection on Derek‚Äôs life and contributions was probably the most satisfying of all the doctors. We were getting close to the end of the second hour and I was feeling more sleepy than sad ‚Äì then Callie happened. Callie‚Äôs tears and comments about Derek were what finally brought on the waterworks for me. The moment was sweet and Sara Ramirez nailed it.\\" TVOverMind also praised Chambers' character: \\"Jo and Alex are still going strong, and their house becomes home base for the tight knit group of doctors the way it was back during Alex and Meredith‚Äôs intern days. Getting on with his life doesn‚Äôt stop Alex from worrying about his best friend, and he doesn‚Äôt stop calling Meredith everyday for months.\\" Ashley Bissette Sumerel of TV Fanatic gave a mixed to positive review mainly praising Ellen Pompeo's character, \\"The episode manages to be both incredibly poignant and emotional, yet a little disappointing at the same time,\\" adding, \\"Something that I've appreciated about Grey's Anatomy Season 11, in general, is the way it has brought focus back to Meredith Grey's character.\\" She also praised Scorsone' performance, \\"Kudos, as usual, to Caterina Scorsone for portraying such difficult emotions in such a raw way,\\" but she too criticized lack of the focus on the death of Dempsey's character, \\"The male lead of a show that has been on for eleven seasons has been killed off, yet a large amount of time is spent focused on other things, particularly since his death affects everyone, but this episode simply tries to do too much. And that's saying a lot, since it happens to be two-hours long.\\" Broadway World strongly criticized the episode and wrote, \\"Seeing Meredith sleep in that big, empty bed alone is a powerful enough image. They could've taken us through the grief in a much neater way. This could have been a brilliantly emotional hour of television. Instead, we got two hours of useless elements that dragged on for two hours,\\" and added the decline in quality of the show stating, \\"and it was never as good as Grey's Anatomy once was. I don't know if it's a change in writers, directors, actors, or a mesh of all of that, but this is not the same show.\\" Us Weekly noted that fans, \\"particularly took issue with Shepherd's funeral that lasted a measly 10 minutes. Meredith was barely around in the first hour, and it went from Easter to Christmas in a matter of 30 minutes,\\" but added that, \\"As for some of the episode's better moments? Grey's fans were moved (aka cried uncontrollably) by everyone's reaction to Derek's tragic death.\\" References External links * \\"She's Leaving Home: Part 1\\" on IMDb * \\"She's Leaving Home: Part 2\\" on IMDb * Grey's Anatomy (season 11) episodes 2015 American television episodes Television episodes about funerals ","title":"She's Leaving Home (Grey's Anatomy)"},{"id":"46586472","title":"2015 Busan Open"},{"id":"46586477","title":"Adrian Serrano"},{"id":"46586525","text":"Map showing location Lann√©dern The Lann√©dern Parish close (Enclos paroissial) is located at Lann√©dern in the Ch√¢teaulin arrondissement within Brittany in north-western France.

There is debate over whether temalacatls were only combat sites or if these stones were also used as sacrificial receptacles where the extracted heart of the victim was deposited in a similar manner as a great cuauhxicalli. However, recent studies show that temalacatl were not used for the slaughter of prisoners, but were fighting platforms and monuments to the Mexica conquests.
