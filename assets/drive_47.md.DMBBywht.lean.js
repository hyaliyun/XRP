History  In 1893, to connect his hotel with the railway station of the Lauterbrunnen-Murren cable car, Johann Sterchi-Wettach, owner of the then Grand Hotel and Kurhaus Mürren, contracted with the company A. Oehler in Wildegg for a tramway to bring his guests from BLM station. The operation was stopped because it failed to submit a concession application. On 13 April 1894, the Federal Assembly approved the federal decree concerning the concession of the Mürren runway. The Federal Council granted the operating license on 10 July 1894 and the tramway began operation. During the three- month summer season, there are 3 to 5 daily trips back and forth. The one-way fare is 30 cents per person, which is approximately equal to the hourly wage of a worker. At , the Murren runway had the smallest gauge of all Swiss railways with federal concession for passenger transport. The rails were laid in the street, and three vehicles were purchased, including a covered passenger car consisting of two benches length-ways on either side, and two goods vehicles. The tramway transported around 1000 guests and of goods per summer season. All vehicles were pulled by horse. Services were suspended from 1914 until the summer season of 1920. In 1930 when passenger services were discontinued. Afterwards, the goods carts were pushed by hand, until 1937 when the tramway closed permanently. The tracks were left disused until the 1960s when, during street renovations, the tracks were either torn up or paved-over. The fate of the goods carts is unknown, however the passenger car remained and has been restored and placed inside the BLM station on display. The Grand Hotel and Kurhaus closed in 1945 and were eventually demolished in 1954.  Route  The tramway started with a two-track station in the street outside the existing BLM station and followed the main village road until the Kurhaus. A switch was installed just before the Kurhaus in order to allow future expansion to other hotels, however this never occurred and the switch was left unused. In the hotel area, the tramway ended with three tracks: the passenger track, which lead to the hotel's entrance, and two more goods tracks, which lead to the hotel's service area. The journey took around 7 minutes to complete.

From an early age, she was dedicated to cultural journalism and took part in the groups, El Techo de la Ballena, Sardio, La República del Este in Caracas and Apocalipsis in Maracaibo.

She also worked as a television screenwriter. Her creations show a constant struggle between her French roots and the Latin American environment. Her poetry is intense and explosive. Her prose works stand out for being dense and moving around several levels of conflict. Her poetry and prose show the same wild character and a bold expression. Her writing embodies an ironic and direct level of language that expresses substantial cynicism. Enriquez Hernández said about her: “Miyó was a suicidal woman and that has to do with her poetry, because it is very disjointed, full of that world of protest, claim”.

He previously served under the warlord Sun Quan (later the founding emperor of Wu) in the late Eastern Han dynasty. Early life and service under Sun Quan Liu Zan was from Changshan County (長山縣), Kuaiji Commandery (會稽郡), which is in present- day Jinhua, Zhejiang. He served as a minor official in the local commandery office in his youth and once fought with Wu Huan (吳桓), a Yellow Turban rebel leader. Although he killed Wu Huan, he was injured in one leg and could not longer straighten it.(吳書曰：留贊字正明，會稽長山人。少為郡吏，與黃巾賊帥吳桓戰，手斬得桓。贊一足被創，遂屈不伸。) Wu Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 64. Despite his injury, Liu Zan remained headstrong and unyielding. He was particularly fond of reading military and history books. Whenever he read about how military commanders in ancient times deployed their troops in battle, he would sigh because he thought that he could never be like them. He once told his family and friends, \\"The Empire is in a state of chaos, with so many people fighting for power. Throughout history, only extraordinary people will succeed in becoming rich and famous. Now that I can't do anything with this crippling injury, I am no different from being dead. I intend to cut my leg. If I am lucky enough to survive and be able to straighten my leg, then I'll be able to pursue my dreams. If I die, then so be it.\\"(然性烈，好讀兵書及三史，每覽古良將戰攻之勢，輒對書獨歎，因呼諸近親謂曰：「今天下擾亂，英豪並起，歷觀前世，富貴非有常人，而我屈躄在閭巷之閒，存亡無以異。今欲割引吾足，幸不死而足申，幾復見用，死則已矣。」) Wu Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 64. His family and friends tried to stop him but to no avail. He cut himself in the leg and let blood flow freely, but became unconscious because of the pain. After he recovered, he could straighten his leg and walk normally again.(親戚皆難之。有閒，贊乃以刀自割其筋，血流滂沱，氣絕良乆。家人驚怖，亦以旣爾，遂引申其足。足申創愈，以得蹉步。) Wu Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 64. Ling Tong, a military officer serving under the warlord Sun Quan, heard about Liu Zan and so impressed that he recommended Liu Zan as a talent to his lord. Liu Zan thus came to serve Sun Quan. After fighting for Sun Quan in some battles, he was promoted to a Colonel of the Garrison Cavalry (屯騎校尉). As Liu Zan was known for being very outspoken, candid and fearless of authority, Sun Quan found him rather intimidating.(淩統聞之，請與相見，甚奇之，乃表薦贊，遂被試用。累有戰功，稍遷屯騎校尉。時事得失，每常規諫，好直言不阿旨，權以此憚之。) Wu Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 64. Battle of Dongxing In 252, after Sun Quan's death, Liu Zan continued serving under Sun Liang, Sun Quan's successor and the second emperor of Eastern Wu. Later that year, Wu's rival state, Wei, launched an invasion and attacked a dam constructed at Dongxing (東興; in present-day Chaohu, Anhui) but Wu forces. The Wu regent Zhuge Ke led Wu forces to resist the invaders, with Liu Zan, Ding Feng, Lü Ju and Tang Zi leading the vanguard force. They seized control of Xu embankment (徐塘) and destroyed one of the enemy's forward camps. The main Wu army followed suit and together they defeated the Wei forces.

Liu Zan was commissioned as Left Protector of the Army (左護軍), given a seal of authority, and ordered to join Sun Jun in the campaign. However, he fell sick on the journey to Shouchun. At the same time, Wei imperial forces had managed to suppress the rebellion already. While preparing to return to Wu, Sun Jun ordered Liu Zan and the troops escorting the supplies to head back first.(孫峻征淮南，授贊節，拜左護軍。未至壽春，道路病發，峻令贊將車重先還。) Wu Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 64.(吴大將孫峻、呂據、留贊等聞淮南亂，會文欽往，乃帥衆將欽徑至壽春；時誕諸軍已至，城不可攻，乃走。) Sanguozhi vol. 28. Taking advantage of the enemy's retreat, the Wei general Zhuge Dan ordered his subordinate Jiang Ban (蔣班) to lead 4,000 troops to pursue and attack Liu Zan.(誕遣將軍蔣班追擊之， ...) Sanguozhi vol. 28. As Liu Zan was ill at the time, he could not get up and direct the troops to fight the enemy. Knowing that they would lose the battle, he passed his ceremonial umbrella and his official seal to his subordinate(s) and told him, \\"As a commander, I have defeated enemies and captured their flags, but I have never lost a single battle. Now, I am sick and outnumbered by the enemy. You should quickly leave while you still can. It won't do our State any good if all of us die here today; it'll only benefit the enemy.\\" When his subordinate(s) refused to leave, he drew his sword and threatened to kill him; only then did his subordinate(s) leave.(魏將蔣班以步騎四千追贊。贊病困，不能整陣，知必敗，乃解曲蓋印綬付弟子以歸，曰：「吾自為將，破敵搴旗，未甞負敗。今病困兵羸，衆寡不敵，汝速去矣，俱死無益於國，適所以快敵耳。」弟子不肯受，拔刀欲斫之，乃去。) Wu Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 64. In the past, when Liu Zan went to battle, he always assembled his troops first and made them sing and roar to boost their morale. He never lost any of the battles he fought in,(初，贊為將，臨敵必先被髮叫天，因抗音而歌，左右應之，畢乃進戰，戰無不克。) Wu Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 64. until his last one.

The 280th episode of the series overall, it first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on September 27, 2017. This episode parodies self-victimization via Native American hardships and trends toward opposition to Columbus Day. Plot Chaos breaks out among the children at school in response to the cancellation of the day off on Columbus Day, due to an anti-Columbus Day campaign by Randy Marsh. Kyle and Stan confront him with photos documenting how Randy himself has dressed as Columbus many times throughout his life, from his wedding to as recently as 2013. This leads to depression for Randy, who says he feels \\"indigenous\\", confusing the term with \\"indignant\\". Randy sees a commercial for a genealogy company called DNA and Me, which includes testimonials from Caucasians who came to identify as victims after discovering that they harbored trace amounts of DNA of historically oppressed ethnic groups. Randy decides to have the DNA in his saliva tested, though he pays a Native American man to French kiss him to ensure the test results indicate that he has Native American DNA. Disguising his voice, Kenny makes a call to Peter Goltman, the school official who cancelled the holiday to get him to search the Internet for Randy's past photos, but Goltman refuses, as he believes everything on the Internet is fake news. As Randy desperately tries to gather and dispose of his previous Columbus costumes, he is repeatedly visited by the Native American man he kissed, who has fallen in love with Randy. Randy rebuffs him, but during the man's second visit, a jogger films Randy, covered in the Columbus costumes he has been gathering, angrily kicking the Native American off his property. The boys later show this video to Goltman. When Randy is informed by the DNA and Me staff of an \\"irregularity\\" from his test, they take a second, anal swab from him, in order to obtain more accurate results. He is informed that his DNA most closely matches Caucasian British person, and that 2.8% of it is Neanderthal, which cross-bred with modern homo sapiens. An enraged Randy interprets this to mean that his ancestors were raped and eradicated by the ancestors of the DNA and Me staff. Returning home, Randy is confronted by Goltman, whom he punches for oppressing his ancestors, but the Native American man also appears, and implores Randy to cease his pretense, and face who he really is. Randy realizes that playing the victim has not solved his problems. At school, he announces that the school's Calendar Committee has reinstated the day off, which has been re-designated Indigenous Peoples' Day. Continuing to express belief that the word \\"indigenous\\" refers to negative feelings, he says this holiday will be for people to express such feelings, but the assembled crowd, offended at his ignorance, trades insults with Randy before gradually dispersing. Reception Jesse Schedeen from IGN rated the episode an 8.5 out of 10, saying \\"While not quite as strong overall as last week's installment, 'Holiday Special' is the episode that best lives up to the promise of what South Park is supposed to be this year. This episode focused a bit less on topical humor and headlines, opting instead for a hilarious, Randy-driven storyline that hearkened back to the show's golden era. If this is a sign of what to expect from the remainder of Season 21, then things are looking pretty rosy for this series.\\" Jeremy Lambert with 411 Mania rated it a 7.8 out of 10, stating \\"[this episode] reminded me of episodes of South Park past. It didn't smack you in the face with current political affairs, it had Randy being crazy, and it had the boys working together in order to benefit them. Another strong episode in a season that is off to a good start.\\" The A.V. Club contributor Dan Caffrey gave the episode a B rating, commenting that the episode's \\"more entertaining\\" message was that \\"Randy's an idiot\\", and went on to add \\"It's a thesis we've heard many times before and will probably hear many times again. And unlike the episode's more substantial message, I'll likely never get tired of hearing it. As long as I don't think about it too much.\\" Writing for Den of Geek, Chris Longo gave it 3 out of 5 stars, and stated \\"What's been the saving grace for this show in the last decade has been using Randy Marsh as the wrench thrown into their playtime and the boys having to make the decision whether or not to dig him out of whatever mess he's created. 'Holiday Special' is just that, a Randy episode that features a real kid-friendly problem, the loss of a school holiday. For the third week in a row we get a fairly topical episode, as Randy is hell bent on removing the honors bestowed on Christopher Columbus.\\" References External links *South Park Studios Episode 2103 \\"Holiday Special\\" Press Release * LGBT-related South Park episodes Race and ethnicity in television South Park (season 21) episodes ","title":"Holiday Special (South Park)"},{"id":"55341357","text":"Aphodius ictericus is a species of scarab beetles native to Europe.Fauna EuropaeaNorman H.

Although she was a prolific painter and potter, Gerrard rarely exhibited during her lifetime and only gained significant recognition after her death. A 1991 exhibition led to a number of British national museums acquiring examples of her work. Biography Gerrard studied at the Slade School of Art from 1922 to 1924 and won several prizes while there. These included the first prize for painting from the cast in 1922, a prize for life painting and, in 1923, a first prize for portrait painting. While at the Slade, she met her future husband Alfred Gerrard who later became head of the Slade sculpture department and then professor of sculpture at the college. The couple married in 1933 and lived in an old farmhouse in Kent. While her husband developed his teaching career and completed several public commissions, Gerrard continued to paint, work on pottery and sculpture and develop a country garden. She painted on either the Sussex Downs or the South Downs on an almost daily basis. During World War II, Gerrard painted a number of rural scenes showing crashed planes and bomb damage. At least one of these was purchased by the War Artists' Advisory Committee. Gerrard also painted more abstract works often with a heavily symbolic content, sometimes with Christian elements. During her life, Gerrard only had one public exhibition of her work, a joint show with her future husband at the Colnaghi gallery in 1931, that featured examples of her pottery and sculpture. In 1991, an exhibition of her work was held at the Royal Museum & Art Gallery in Canterbury. This led to a reappraisal of her work and a number of British museums and galleries acquired examples of her art. These included the Tate, the Imperial War Museum and the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge.

He was the father of Lieutenant-colonel Paul Flatters, who led a tragic mission in the Sahara in 1881. Life Turenne by Jean-Jacques Flatters Jean Jacques Flatters was born on 6 November 1786 in Krefeld, Westphalia. He came from Westphalia to Paris to study sculpture and painting. He was a pupil of Jean-Antoine Houdon (1741–1828) and Jacques-Louis David (1748–1825). Flatters began exhibiting at the Salon in 1810. On 25 September 1813 he won the second prize for sculpture in the Prix de Rome. Jean-Jacques Flatters served in the French army from February to July 1814 at the close of the First French Empire. During the Bourbon Restoration Flatters earned a living by making busts of famous people such as Goethe and Byron. He received only three official commissions before 1830: a bust in 1819 and two more busts in 1829. A letter of 9 November 1830 has survived that Flatters wrote to the Count of Montalivet, Minister of the Interior. In it he states that the Minister Perronnet [sic] had promised him the job of created a marble statue of Saint Louis, while the sculptor James Pradier would make one of Charlemagne, but now both jobs had been given to Pradier. Flatters described the many difficulties he had experienced in his career and appealed to the minister to give him justice. On 4 September 1831 Flatters was given compensation of 5,000 francs for loss of the commission. In 1830 Flatters married Emile-Dircée Lebon, daughter of the Napoleonic colonel Simon Lebon. Their son was Paul Flatters (1832–81), the future explorer. Jean Jacques Flatters died on 19 August 1845 in Paris, aged 58.

Players take the role of Detective Officer Kettering, who is inspecting the supposed suicide of a British financier on a cruise ship in the waters near Miami. His job is to unravel the mystery.  Gameplay  Players progress by collecting clues, interrogating people, and interacting with the environment. The interface is largely text-based, with occasional images to set the scene. Commands are given to complete actions. Gameplay is split into three parts which represent the three days of investigation.  Development  The game was written by Fergus McNeill, who had previous authored The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings parody games The Boggit and Bored of the Rings. It is based on a novel of the same name by Dennis Wheatley; this text already had some interactivity through the use of physical clues provided with the book such as a blood-stained curtain and cigarette butts, plus an envelope at the end cover to reveal the answer.

A small patrol of the English Army led by the Irish officer Patrick Sarsfield, clashed with a detachment of the invading Dutch Army in the town of Wincanton in Somerset. It was one of the few notable actions fought during the campaign which has sometimes acquired the name the \\"bloodless revolution\\".Harris & Taylor, p. 5. Background Following the landing of William of Orange in Devon, forces loyal to James II had assembled on Salisbury Plain. Colonel Patrick Sarsfield was one of the most active officers on the King's behalf, at a time of growing doubts about the trustworthiness of other commanders. Inconclusive reports had arrived that enemy forces had been spotted at Bruton, close to Wincanton. Sarsfield was ordered by his superior General Percy Kirke to take out a fresh patrol and investigate.Wauchope, p. 36. Skirmish On the morning of 20 November, Sarsfield rode out from the royal camp with 120 Horse Guards and Horse Grenadier Guards including his second-in-command and fellow Irishman Henry Luttrell. After riding to Bruton, they discovered that the enemy force had marched to Wincanton the previous day.Wauchope, p. 37. The Dutch troops were in fact a small advance guard of around thirty infantry who had been sent ahead of their main army to secure horses for military use. They were Scottish troops of Hugh Mackay's regiment who were serving in the Scots Brigade of the Dutch Army, and were led by a Lieutenant Campbell. Their instructions were to remain at Wincanton until joined by William's main force.Wauchope, p. 37. Campbell received warning of the enemy's approach from local inhabitants sympathetic to William, and decided to set an ambush for Sarsfield's men between Flingers Lane and Ireson Lane just outside Wincanton. Unsure if the approaching cavalry were hostile, given they might be deserters, Campbell shouted out a challenge demanding to know who the men supported. Sarsfield replied King James, and after Campbell responded that he was for Prince of Orange, Sarsfield reportedly cried \\"God damn you! I'll Prince You!\\" and both sides opened fire.Wauchop, p. 38. In the ensuing melee Campbell was shot dead. Although Sarsfield's men comfortably outnumbered their opponents, the Scottish troops were in well-concealed positions and their fire took out several of the cavalryman. Many of Sarsfield's men dismounted and fought on foot, returning the enemy fire and hurling grenades at them. Henry Lutrell led some of his men to outflank the enemy who were increasingly vulnerable.Wauchope, p. 38. The fighting was stopped by one of the locals who rushed out of Wincanton warning Sarsfield's men that they were about to be attacked by large Dutch reinforcements in the village. This was in fact a completely false report, brought out by a miller who supported William's cause. A cautious Sarsfield disengaged and pulled his men back out of musket range, allowing the remaining Scots time to flee.Wauchope, p. 38-39. Sarsfield subsequently occupied Wincanton, having taken six prisoners and some of the horses that the Scottish troops had been gathering. Several of Sarsfield's men had been killed or wounded. Cornet John Webb, a future general, was badly wounded and had to be left in the village to recover. A total of twelve Scots, including Campbell, had been killed in the fighting.Wauchope, p. 39. Aftermath News of the fighting quickly spread around the country. Some reports wrongly suggested a major battle had taken place at Wincanton in which the King's forces had been routed.Wauchope, p. 39. Wincanton was then occupied by the Dutch Army and William spent the night at a house there. The skirmish, along with the subsequent Battle of Reading, proved to be one of only two armed clashes during 1688. Although a major battle between the two field armies was widely anticipated, very little fighting took place. A series of defections amongst his senior officers led James to order a retreat to London; his army gradually disintegrated along the way and was finally disbanded at Uxbridge. William was able to enter London without fighting the expected pitched battle. James fled into exile, while William and his wife were crowned in his place. Patrick Sarsfield subsequently distinguished himself fighting for James during the Williamite War in Ireland (1689-91).  Commemoration  The Orange Way long-distance footpath, created in 2003 to follow William's route from Devon to London, passes through Wincanton.

Location Bir el- Garama is also known as Taguienout or Tadjenout. It is about above sea level. The name means \\"well of the Garamentes\\". It is on the southern slope of the Hoggar Mountains, dug in the bed of the Wadi Ti-n-Tarabine, a tributary of the Wadi Tefassanet, which is in turn a tributary of the Niger River. Flatters expedition In 1881 Paul Flatters led an expedition south to survey a route for a trans-Saharan railway. Before the expedition left Ouargla plans had been made to destroy it by the Kel Ahaggar Tuaregs of the Hoggar Mountains, the Awlad Sidi Shaykh confederation and the Senussi. They knew the planned route and were kept informed by the expedition guides, who helped sabotage the expedition by leading it past wells. Six hundred men of the three tribes gathered to ambush the expedition near Bir el-Garama. Tuaregs had been shadowing the expedition for several days when it approached the wells of Bir- el-Gharama. However Flatters considered that Ahitagel ag Muhammad Biska, the Amenukal of the Kel Ahaggar, completely controlled the area and would ensure that no French were harmed in his land. Near In-Uhawen, or the wells of Tadjenout, Flatters left his baggage in camp with half his troops while he and his officers and scientific staff went to find the well, followed by the camels. Flatters told a guide who warned of danger, \\"we have nothing to fear\\". Half an hour after they found the well, Flatters and his men were surrounded by a large force of Tuaregs armed with lances and muzzle-loading muskets. Some men tried to flee on the camels, but the animals refused to leave the well. Flatters, Masson, Beringer, Roche, Guiard and the expedition's commissary Deverny were killed, as were 30 camel drivers. Only ten men escaped. The Tuaregs took almost all of the 250 camels.

It is hypothesized that the invasive plant species has a negative effect on Tetrigidae as it changes the microclimate in the habitat by changing the habitat's structure and providing more shade.

He served principally as a diplomat for the pope in negotiations directed toward the settling of the Great Western Schism, though his efforts had to be directed mostly to keeping Benedict from being repudiated by the French government. He himself finally abandoned Benedict and joined the cardinals who called for a general council of the Church. He participated in the Council of Pisa, and was one of the electors of Pope Alexander V. He also participated in the Council of Constance, and was one of the electors of Pope Martin V. Biography Antoine de Challant, whose family was one of the four great families of the Val d'Aosta, was the son of Aymon de Challant, the Lord of Fenis, Castellan of Lanzo, Moriana, Avigliana, Chambéry, Tarentaise, Susa, Montmélian, Ivrea, Bard, Sallanches and Castruzzone, Governor of Ivrea, and Bailiff of Val di Susa and Savoy. His mother was Fiorina Provana, of the Counts of Leyni. His elder brother Bonifacio became Lord of Fenis. His brother Guillaume was Bishop of Lausanne from 1406 to 1431.Eubel, p. 297. Antoine was an Archdeacon of Reims from 1388 and Archdeacon of Chartres (1394), He was deprived of his benefices on 5 October 1408 by Benedict XIII, after he had repudiated the Benedictine Obedience. The decree was cancelled by Pope Alexander V in the Twentieth Session (sometimes called the XIX Session) of the Council of Pisa, on 1 July 1409. and at his death he was Prior of Chamonix and Megève (diocese of Geneva).Uginet, quoting from the Libri Supplicationum in the Vatican Archives. Challant was a Papal Chamberlain and Chancellor of Count Amadeo VIII of Savoy from 1402 to 1404.Gallia christiana XV, p. 371. His patent of appointment to the chancellorship calls him legum doctorem et archidiaconum Remensem. He was succeeded by his brother Guillaume, Abbot of San Michele della Chiusa, on 30 June 1404. In 1411 Cardinal Antoine became Abbot Commendatory of S. Michele.Claretta, pp. 149-152. He governed the benefice through a procurator, Filiberto Dionisio: Claretta, p. 214. Cardinal of Benedict XIII On 9 May 1404 Antoine de Challant was named a cardinal by Pope Benedict XIII, and assigned the Deanery of Santa Maria in Via Lata. On 1 June 1404 Pope Benedict XIII named Cardinal Chaillant Archbishop of Tarentaise, but since he was not consecrated a bishop, he could only serve as Apostolic Administrator. He served until his death. Early in 1406 Challant was sent to Paris by Benedict XIII to defend his interests as calls for the subtraction of obedience to the Avignon pope grew, especially in the University. Challat was badly received, and the royal princes did not wish to recognize his status as papal Legate. He was not received at Court by King Charles VI until 29 April. His address received a reply from the orator of the University of Paris, Jean Petit, on 13 May, in which Benedict XIII was strongly attacked for his bad faith and tricks. The demand for subtraction of obedience was renewed in the strongest terms. The matter was referred to the Parlement, where, on 5 June the matter was presented again by Jean Petit, and seconded by the King's advocate, Jean Juvénal des Ursins. The matter was discussed until 14 July, when the Parlement decided against Benedict XIII and the University of Toulouse, and Cardinal de Challant was compelled to withdraw. Revolt against Benedict XIII He was present at the Council of Pisa, which was held from 25 March to 2 August 1409. He did not appear until the Sixteenth Session, on Monday 10 July 1409, having already been declared contumacious in the Fourth Session because he had not left the Obedience of Benedict XIII and obeyed the summons to attend the Council in Pisa. It was necessary to rehabilitate him, and therefore Cardinal Niccolò Brancaccio (Avignon Obedience), the Cardinal Bishop of Albano, spoke in his favor, claiming that Challant had stayed with Benedict only to attempt to persuade him to end the schism. Challant was allowed to take his seat with the other cardinals in the Council.J.-D. Mansi (ed.), Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio. editio novissima. Tomus XXVII (Venice: Antonius Zatta 1784), p. 405. In 1411 Pope John XXIII intended to send Antoine de Challant to France as Papal Legate, with even more extensive powers than had been granted to Cardinal Pierre de Thury. The nomination was disapproved by the three royal princes, due (it is said) to Challant's défaut de naissance, son manque d'instruction, ses mauvaises moeurs ('his inadequate birth, his lack of instruction, his bad character'). Challant was later blamed by the French as one of those responsible for the invention of John XXIII's oppressive financial exaction scheme for France.Valois, IV (1906), p. 425 with note. The information is attributed to a confidant of Benedict XIII, and placed in 1411. In fact Challant was an aristocrat and possessed a doctorate. The attribution to the dukes should be treated with great caution. Challant was promoted to the rank of Cardinal priest of Santa Cecilia by John XXIII on 19 March 1412, and Cardinal Chamberlain.Eubel, p. 40. Merlet, pp. LII and 133. Council of Constance In 1413 Cardinal de Challant was sent by Pope John along with Cardinal Francesco Zabarella and Manuel Chrysoloras on an embassy to the Emperor Sigismund, with the purpose of agreeing on a place to hold a general council of the Church. On 30 October the Emperor announced that the Council would be held in Constance beginning on 1 November 1414.Hefele, p. 101. The letters granting the legates plenary powers, at least in appearance, was not sent until 25 August 1413. The Pope had a list of acceptable venues, which he shared orally with the legates. Cardinal Antoine de Challant participated in the Council of Constance from 1414 to 1418. He acted as a negotiator, between the Italian Natio and the French Nation, and between the Council and John XXIII. In December 1414, a group of negotiators, including Challant, Zabarella, Rinaldo Brancaccio and Branda Castiglione, presented a proposal for relaxing the restrictions placed on the living conditions of the Pope.Hefele, p. 177. On 18 March 1415, the Italian Nation met at the Dominican convent in Constance, and sent a committee of five cardinals, including Cardinal de Challant, to the French Nation, to discuss what was to be done about the procuratorship which John XXIII was unwilling to provide. He was one of the seven cardinals who were present at the Sixth Session of the Council, on Wednesday 17 April 1415, at which the procuratorship granted by Pope John XXIII for the purpose of resigning the papacy was read.Mansi, Tomus XXVII, p. 606-607.

On 19 April 1418, during the general Session of the Council of Constance, Cardinal de Challant read the decree of Pope Martin V convoking the next general council. On 22 April he read the decree closing the Council of Constance and granting the indulgences for the attendees.Uginet (1980), \\"Challant, Antoine,\\".

What follows is a partial history of some of the well known mass conversions.  Forced conversions   Middle Ages  Forced conversions of Jews were carried out with support of rulers during Late Antiquity and the early Middle Ages in Gaul, the Iberian peninsula and in the Byzantine empire. Royal persecutions of Jews from the late eleventh century onward generally took form of expulsions, with some exceptions, such as conversions of Jews in southern Italy of the 13th century, which were carried out by Dominican Inquisitors but instigated by King Charles II of Naples. Jews were forced to convert to Christianity by the Crusaders in Lorraine, on the Lower Rhine, in Bavaria and Bohemia, in Mainz and in Worms.  Early modern Iberian peninsula  The majority of Spain's Jews converted to Christianity as a result of pogroms in 1391. Those remaining practicing Jews were expelled by the Catholic monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella in the Alhambra Decree in 1492, following the Christian Reconquest of Spain. As a result of the Alhambra Decree and persecution in prior years, over 200,000 Jews converted to Catholicism and between 40,000 and 100,000 were expelled. Meanwhile, in Portugal, although an order for their expulsion was given in 1496, only a handful were allowed to leave, the rest being forced to convert.  Eastern Europe  Between the years of 1648 and 1649, a large-scale uprising of Cossacks and Ukrainian peasants led by Bohdan Khmelnytsky swept through the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the area of today's Ukraine. In the course of the fighting, there were many Jewish casualties, and many Jewish communities were destroyed. A large number also converted to Eastern Orthodoxy. In the 18th century, Elizabeth of Russia launched a campaign of forced conversion of Russia's non-Orthodox subjects, including Muslims and Jews.Dominic Lieven, ed. (2006). The Cambridge History of Russia: Volume 2, Imperial Russia, 1689-1917. Cambridge University Press. p. 186. Also, in the second half of the 18th century, a mass conversion to Catholicism occurred by followers of Jacob Frank.  Post-Enlightenment  Though forced conversions were less common in the 20th century, missionary activity remained strong, and many Jews chose to convert in order to integrate into secular society. A critical period in Britain followed when many of the chief Sephardic families — including the Bernals, Furtados, Ricardos, Disraelis, Ximenes, Lopezs and Uzziellis joined the church. Germany had three main periods of conversion, the first beginning during the Mendelssohnian era and a second wave occurred during the first half of the 19th century. A list of 32 Jewish families and 18 unmarried Jews who had recently converted was given by David Friedlander to Prussian State Chancellor Hardenberg in 1811.Rabbi Abraham Geiger, \\"Vor Hundert Jahren,\\" Brunswick, 1899 In the eight old Prussian provinces between the years of 1816–43, during the reign of Frederick William III., 3,984 Jews were baptized, among them the many of richest and most cultured (2,200 from 1822–1840, according to the Jewish Encyclopedia). The third and longest period of secession was due to antisemitism, and began in the year 1880. Across the German states, with the exception of Austria and France, many Jews obtained high stations and large revenues in return for their renouncing Judaism. 40,000 Russians alone are believed to have been converted between 1836 and 1875.“Missionsblatt des Rheinisch-Westphälischen Vereins für Israel,\\" 1878, p. 122 while in Britain during that period, the number has been estimated at 50,000.Johannes Friedrich Alexander de le Roi, \\"Die Evangelische Christenheit und die Juden,\\" iii. 60 Various estimates have been put forward as to the total number of conversions during the 19th century. One Christian encyclopedia writes that the number exceeded 100,000; while the Jewish Encyclopedia records approximately 190,000. Other contemporary sources put the number at 130,000 or even as many as 250,000.“Divre Emeth,\\" 1880, p. 47; 1883, p. 187 As a result of the high rate of conversion, many Christians can be found with a measure of Jewish parentage. In 1930s Germany, Nazi officials discovered that the German Christian population with some level of Jewish ancestry almost equalled that of the Jewish community of just over five hundred thousand. Today, according to 2013 data from the Pew Research Center, about 1.6 million adult American Jews identify themselves as Christians, most of them Protestant. Of those, most were raised as Jews or are Jews by ancestry. According to a 2012 study 17% of Jews in Russia identify themselves as Christians.2012 Survey Maps. \\"Ogonek\\", № 34 (5243), 27/08/2012.

His was born into an old established Massachusetts family that centered around a conservative Christian lifestyle. His father was a successful business man and politician, one brother a Christian minister, and another brother a professor at Harvard University. As a young man, he chose a seaman's life, visiting much of the world and becoming a multi-linguist. After retiring as a sea captain, he devoted later years to researching the health benefits of edible fungi. Palmer and Liliuokalani first crossed paths at a diplomatic ball in Honolulu, when he was a sea captain on temporary residency. She was a young newlywed, and he had not yet reached the age of 30. Over the next several decades, their paths continued to cross. An avowed royalist who believed Hawaiians had been the object of missionary bigotry, Palmer was twice sent to Hawaii by United States newspapers to cover the unfolding political events following the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. His public support of the monarchy put him in the position of being the target of ridicule and harassment by those favoring annexation, which included most of the established newspapers in Hawaii. After release from her imprisonment, Liliuokalani recruited Palmer as her personal assistant when she was in residence at Boston and Washington D. C., protesting the annexation of Hawaii. He became her official spokesperson, a stenographer and secretary who assisted with her literary publishing, and her staunch ally. She, in turn, referred to him as a man of \\"unblemished honor and integrity\\". Background He was one of nine children born to Julius Aboyneau Palmer Sr. and his wife Lucy Manning Peabody. The Palmers were descended from English immigrants who arrived in Massachusetts in 1621. The Peabody family were distant relatives who also immigrated to Massachusetts about the same time. Palmer Sr. was a partner in Palmer, Batchelder, & Co jewelers, a deacon in Boston's Mount Vernon Church, treasurer of the Christian publishing firm American Tract Society, and active in many community organizations. The elder Palmer was a Whig Party politician who was elected in 1843 to the Massachusetts state legislature, eventually serving in both houses; in 1858 the Temperance Party of Boston nominated him as their candidate for mayor. Harvard University professor George Herbert Palmer, brother to Julius Jr., described the family life as \\"a Puritan home\\". His brother Frederick Palmer was minister of a Congregational church. Young Julius chose a career sailing the seas, beginning as an ordinary sailor and in succeeding years working his way up the ranks to become captain of his own vessel. The career provided him with sufficient income to retire at an early age. Even in retirement, he maintained his captain's certification. According to the Boston Athenæum, his travels gave him fluency in several languages and took him to many ports around the world. At home in Boston, Palmer gravitated towards socializing with non-English speaking foreigners. In early 1870, he was involved in a lawsuit for his commission on the $10,000 sale of the steamship Kalorama, which he previously commanded. According to his account in The Pacific Commercial Advertiser, he held credentials as Master mariner (professional qualification of captaincy), and had once commanded both the clipper ship and the Island Home steamer. He held a life membership in the Boston Marine Society and New York American Shipmasters' Association. He spent a number of years in and out of San Francisco, where he was involved with Chinese immigrants, and wrote to the Boston Advertiser trying to dispel public misconceptions of them as a labor force. In September 1870, Palmer opened a Boston employment agency for Chinese domestic workers. He was a founding member and president of the Boston Mycological Club. Palmer advocated the consumption of fungus as a healthy food source, and had several articles and two books published on the subject. According to people who spoke with him towards the end of his life, he considered his pioneering research in the field of mushrooms to be his proudest achievement. Palmer engaged in the profession of money brokering to support himself while pursuing his mushroom research. Hawaii Kingdom of Hawaii  His first known visit to the islands was during the Kingdom of Hawaii in the mid-1860s, on a sugarcane molasses buying trip that kept him docked there for about a year and a half. During this visit he was the guest of Hawaii Attorney General Stephen Henry Phillips at a ball held aboard the French frigate Venus, where he first met Liliuokalani and briefly spoke to her as she circulated among the guests. He referred to her in his book as Mrs. Dominis, the time frame of which indicates she would have been a newlywed. Some people in Hawaii believed that the subsequent series of articles appearing in the Boston Commercial Bulletin, which bore the pseudonym \\"A Cape Horner\\", had actually been written by Palmer. The anonymous author criticized the reciprocity treaty efforts, while admonishing individuals by name.Numerous attempts were made during the reign of Kamehameha IV to get a reciprocity treaty as an alternative to annexation with the United States, efforts did not come to fruition until the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875 was negotiated by Kalākaua. (Kuykendall 1953, pp. 35–47) In 1871, writing under his own name for The Christian Union, Palmer rebuked the missionaries for what he believed to be practices motivated by bigotry towards the Hawaiian people. The Pacific Commercial Advertiser accused him of, \\" ... misrepresenting, and defaming us, either willfully or stupidly.\\" In December of that year, Palmer began publishing \\"A Home Picture\\" of his Hawaii memories in the Commercial Bulletin. With some sarcastic introductory comments, The Pacific Commercial Appeal ran an excerpt of Palmer's memories, wherein he speculated that Hawaii would never be taken over by the United States. Liliuokalani and Palmer would meet again in 1887, when both were on the guest list at the housewarming party of Massachusetts Governor Oliver Ames. Provisional Government of Hawaii The January 17, 1893 overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii removed Liliuokalani from power and installed a provisional government under Sanford B. Dole, an American born in Hawaii to missionary parents. Palmer visited Hawaii that year and socially met Liliuokalani twice, once in her own home when he was accompanied by Archibald Scott Cleghorn, the father of Princess Kaʻiulani. The Boston Transcript sent Palmer to Hawaii as an observer to the political situation in February 1894. He immediately agitated people with a letter to The Hawaiian Star stating that he viewed the proposed Republic an unstable prospect. Nevertheless, he was granted an interview with Dole. Allowed to edit his own words before publication, Dole referred to \\"our forefathers\\" of the American Revolution and compared the overthrow of Liliuokalani to the actions of Union Army during the Civil War in the United States. Palmer left Hawaii in March 1894, and published Memories of Hawaii and Hawaiian correspondence, a compilation of his various trips to Hawaii, as well as the Boston Transcript reports. He asserted that only the United States and Russia had recognized the legitimacy of the provisional government. Palmer alleged government censorship of the Hawaiian news media, and stated that the motivations for the overthrow were financial greed and a lust for power. An anonymous writer at The Hawaiian Star took aim at his qualifications as a journalist, and accused him of misleading the public and the United States Senate. They dismissed him as \\"that silly Royalist\\" and suggested he be \\"kicked in the lobby by one of the pages of the Senate.\\" Presbyterian minister Sereno E. Bishop, ally of Lorrin A. Thurston and the men who overthrew the monarchy, was asked to make a rebuttal to Palmer's book. At the end of the rebuttal, Bishop expressed pride in being exactly what Palmer had accused him of being, a fanatic. Republic of Hawaii A year after the publication of Memories of Hawaii and Hawaiian correspondence, Palmer returned in the employ of the Evening Post. Dole was president of the new Republic of Hawaii. Liliuokalani was imprisoned at Iolani Palace for her alleged involvement in the 1895 Wilcox rebellion, and the government denied Palmer's request to interview her. He kept in touch with her through intermediaries, offering his unconditional friendship and services. Annexationists attacked Palmer's royalist views, and accused him of falsifying information. The Pacific Commercial Advertiser published Palmer's stated purpose of his visit, but subtitled it \\"The Skipper Punishes the Public With Egotistical Elucidations\\". Thurston branded him \\"the devil's advocate\\", and Evening Post editor-in-chief Edwin Lawrence Godkin \\"pope Godkin\\". When Palmer left Hawaii in May, The Pacific Commercial Advertiser labeled him as the skipper of \\"The Lying Dutchman\\", accusing him of searching for \\"liars and freaks\\" and using statements \\"of pure malice and cussedness\\". In response, The Daily Bulletin of Hawaii branded that editorial a \\"vial attack\\" and countered that The Pacific Commercial Advertiser was a paid mouthpiece for the government. Palmer published his second complication book Again in Hawaii after leaving the islands in June. The San Francisco Call noted its bias against the Republic's government, and its emphasis on restoring the monarchy with Princess Kaiulani on the throne; however, they declined to dismiss Palmer's assertions and suggested a wait-and-see approach to the unfolding historical events.:*  Liliuokalani's assistant and spokesperson According to Palmer, he returned to Boston with an undisclosed \\"important mission\\" given him by intermediaries of Liliuokalani. He never revealed the specifics, but said he had accomplished it within six months of his return. Liliuokalani left Hawaii in December 1896 for a visit with her Boston relatives Sara Lee and William Lee, a partner in Lee & Shepard book publishers. It was the first trip outside Hawaii for her accompanying secretary Joseph Heleluhe. Needing an additional assistant familiar with American culture and politics, she requested Palmer meet her at the Boston train station. Her perspective of him was that of a man with \\"unblemished honor and integrity\\", and they shared a common vision for a restoration of the monarchy. For the next month, Palmer acted as her personal assistant and refused her offers of monetary compensation for his services. She made his position official on January 22, providing him with a generous salary. Palmer stayed in the job until August 7. Palmer's responsibilities as her assistant included arranging for tickets in the diplomatic gallery of the United States Senate for the March 4, 1897 inauguration of William McKinley. At her own public receptions, which the queen estimated numbered anywhere between 200 and 500 persons, guests presented their calling cards to Palmer, who in turn introduced each guest. One of his recurring functions was as a press secretary, giving interviews or submitting lengthy opinion pieces under his name to newspapers. Both methods of disseminating information to the general public reflected the queen's viewpoints, but shielded her by showing only Palmer as the sole interviewee or author. He asserted that since her abdication had been done under threats, it wasn't a legitimate abdication. The Hawaii newspapers reacted sarcastically with attacks on Palmer's character and his spin of history. Some rebuttals were from a frequent contributor to the Washington, D. C. Evening Star under the pseudonym \\"Kamehameha\\", a known alias of Sereno E. Bishop in Honolulu. During May, Palmer acted as a royal escort accompanying the queen's lady-in-waiting Elizabeth Kahele Manawaola St. John (Mrs. Kia Nahaolelua) to California to return to her family in Hawaii. On his return trip, Palmer brought Wakeke Ululani Heleluhe to join her husband Joseph and assume the lady-in-waiting position. Liliuokalani's June 17, 1897 protest against the annexation treaty was witnessed by Palmer, and both Wakeke and Joseph Heleluhe. It was delivered to the State Department by Palmer and Heleluhe. The treaty lay claim to seizing only government land. Author Neil Thomas Proto noted that Palmer stressed in a letter printed in the New York Times that due to a portion of the land recognized as the Crown's private property, Liliuokalani's consent was required for annexation. On August 7, Liliuokalani and her entourage headed back to Hawaii. At that point, Palmer asked for a leave of absence to return home. By his estimation, she had 5,000 visitors in his time of service. He was her secretary and stenographer, helping to write every letter, note, or publication. He was her literary support in the 1897 publication of the Kumulipo translation, helped her in compiling a book of her songs, and assisted her as she wrote her biography (Hawaii's Story). When interviewed about her in late September 1897, he said, \\"At any hour that she may call for me, I am ready to hasten back to her service.\\" He was a member of the Massachusetts Reform Club, which passed a resolution on December 18, 1897 declaring annexation of Hawaii \\"unjust and unwise\\". Aftermath  In an interview with The Boston Globe shortly after his service to her ended, he spoke of his employment with her, of his relationship with her dating back to their first meeting, his loyalty to her, and his respect for her. The Globe had subtitled the interview, \\"Remarkable Statement of the Romantic Relations Existing Between the Ex-Queen Liliuokalani and Her Famous Boston Secretary,\\" but nothing in Palmer's statements suggested a romance existed. Described in his later years as a short, stocky man with white hair, the personal presentation of Palmer was mentioned in numerous articles over the years. He had a fondness for white suits with brass buttons, or diamond stickpins, in warm weather. When out stalking the wild mushroom, Palmer wore high water pants (slacks with the cuffs above the ankles). In articles published in the United States, writers seemed impressed in how he presented himself. In Hawaii, where much of the media made personal attacks against him, the same clothing and his personal presentation were interpreted as \\"modest little pansy by the wayside\\", and \\"the ladylike little correspondent\\". Palmer died at his home in Wellfleet, Massachusetts, on January 11, 1899. He was married to a woman identified as Effie W. Palmer. She pre-deceased him circa 1895, and the couple had no children. Both he and his wife were converts to the Roman Catholic church. After her death, he lived alone, did his own housekeeping and cooking, and cared for himself until the end. The brief obituaries of him mention that he was survived by three brothers: Prof. George H. Palmer of Harvard, the Rev. Frederick Palmer of Andover and Jacob P. Palmer of New York.

He is most famous for composing the waltz Amur Waves. Education and military service According to Kyuss's autobiography, he was born into a working-class Jewish family in Odessa on March 20, 1874. He was drafted into the Russian army and assigned to a squad of musicians. After doing mandatory service, he joined and graduated from the Odessa National Academy of Music, and in 1903 rejoined the army as a kapellmeister. He served in the 2nd Eastern Siberian Rifle Regiment, and participated in the Russo–Japanese War of 1905. During his service, while stationed in Vladivostok, he composed his magnum opus, the waltz Amur Waves. From May 1, 1907 Kyuss served in the 11th Eastern Siberian Rifle Regument, and from January 1, 1911 in the 33rd Siberian Rifle Regiment. In this capacity he was stationed on Russky Island. In 1911 he became a Lutheran.Откуда скользят «Амурские волны» // lechaim.ru Kyuss participated in World War I as a kapellmeister in the 5th Don Cossack Regiment, then in the Gregorian Special Cavalier Battalion. In the Russian Civil War, Kyuss was a kapellmeister for the Red Army, serving in the 416th Black Sea Rifle Regiment. In 1920–22 he served in the same capacity in the 33rd Rifle Brigade in Odessa. In 1922 he headed an orchestra in Kharkiv, and for a time headed the Kremlin honor guard—though according to his superiors, he was \\"politically backward\\", i.e. did not adhere enough to the Communist ideology—a problem for an officer so close to the government. He retired from military command in 1927. He continued working as a military composer in the Joint State Political Directorate until 1934. Among other things, he was a kapellmeister during the construction of the Moscow Canal. In 1934 he joined the Odessa People's Militia as a kapellmeister.

He is the Frank Hawkins Kenan Distinguished Professor of Marine Biology in the Department of Biology and Marine Biology at the University of North Carolina Wilmington. He is best known for studies of sponges on Caribbean coral reefs that reveal ecological principles such as resource trade-offs, trophic cascades and indirect effects. Early life and education Pawlik was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota to Richard Joseph Pawlik and Shirley Joyce (Reed) Pawlik as the third of 4 children. He credits his early childhood interest in marine biology to watching public television broadcasts of The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau. He was raised in the City of St. Anthony Village, a suburb northeast of Minneapolis and graduated in 1978 from St. Anthony Village High School.Bucko, T., Beaubien, S., Berg, J., Yurek, L.A., Johnsen, D., Jasinski, S., Plotnik, R. (1978). Villager 1978: Memories and Photographs, the St. Anthony Village High School Yearbook. Volume 17. In 1982, he graduated with a BS degree in Biological Sciences from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities after taking summer courses his sophomore and junior years at the Bermuda Biological Station for Research, now BIOS. Work The vicious circle hypothesis for the lack of recovery of Caribbean coral reefs. The major component of the hypothesis is a feedback loop between sponges, which consume dissolved organic carbon and release plant nutrients, and seaweeds, which consume nutrients and release dissolved organic carbon. Pawlik did his graduate research on the chemical cues that cause the planktonic larvae of marine invertebrates to metamorphose into sessile adults, focusing on sandcastle worms, a group of annelid worms that build tubes of sand that can form reefs. In collaboration with the natural products chemists in the laboratories of his mentors, D. John Faulkner and William Fenical, he began working on the chemical defenses of marine invertebrates, including limpets, gorgonian corals, and sea slugs. At UNCW, Pawlik began working on the chemical defenses of sponges on Caribbean reefs, a project that was funded by the National Science Foundation for over 23 years. With his students and collaborators, Pawlik characterized the chemical defenses of over 100 species of sponges across the Caribbean, and discovered a resource trade-off between the production of defensive secondary metabolites versus growth or reproduction among sponge species. Originally demonstrated with manipulative experiments, the resource-trade off was subsequently validated in surveys across the Caribbean by targeting reefs that were intensively overfished versus those that had been protected from fishing. On overfished Caribbean reefs, the absence of sponge predators resulted in the overgrowth of reef- building corals by fast growing, chemically undefended sponge species, providing unambiguous evidence to support fishing restrictions to protect coral reefs. Most recently, Pawlik and colleagues have integrated the chemical defense-based ecosystem model with evidence of increasing sponge abundance and new data on carbon and nutrient cycling by sponges to propose the “vicious circle hypothesis” to explain the lack of resilience of Caribbean coral reefs relative to reefs in the Indo-Pacific.

Pawlik is a proponent of critical rationalism for the advancement of science; he discusses the concept in the courses he teaches and has openly challenged the conclusions of other studies throughout his career. As a graduate student he contested the claim that neurotransmitters were related to the natural inducers of marine invertebrate larval settlement, arguing that the results of still-water, laboratory experiments with bioactive compounds were artifacts and not ecologically relevant. Along with collaborators, he has challenged the idea that sponges of the genus Aplysina protect themselves with “activated” chemical defenses. Among marine invertebrates, such as nudibranch molluscs, he has found little evidence for optimized chemical defense strategies, warning coloration, or mimicry. More recently, Pawlik and colleagues have challenged the claim that sponge communities on Caribbean reefs are primarily controlled by bottom-up factors (food availability), instead asserting that community structure is primarily a product of top-down control (due to predation). Videography Pawlik has been an amateur underwater photographer since the 1980s, but recently turned to video to capture the current state of coral reef environments and to provide outreach related to his scientific publications. His videos are posted on YouTube at the channel “Pawlik Lab.\\" Two short videos, “Sponges of the Caribbean\\" and “The maid did it!\\" were finalists in the Ocean 180 video challenge, a science video outreach competition sponsored by the National Science Foundation, in 2015 and 2016, respectively.

As part of the settlement, she got the rights to the novel Saint Jack, which she had wanted to make into a film ever since Orson Welles gave her a copy. Production Saint Jack was shot entirely on location in various places in Singapore in May and June 1978. Places featured in the film include the former Empress Place hawker centre (now demolished) and Bugis Street. The local authorities knew about the book, hence the foreign production crew did not tell them that they were adapting it, fearing that they would not be permitted to shoot the film. Instead, they created a fake synopsis for a film called Jack of Hearts, (what the director called \\"a cross between Love Is a Many Splendored Thing and Pal Joey\\") and most of the Singaporeans involved in the production believed this was what they were making. Release The film was banned in Singapore and Malaysia on January 17, 1980. Singapore banned it \\"largely due to concerns that there would be excessive edits required to the scenes of nudity and some coarse language before it could be shown to a general audience\\", and lifted the ban only in March 2006. It is now an M18-rated film. Saint Jack was re- released in North America on DVD in 2001. In an interview with The New York Times on 15 March 2006, Bogdanovich said \\"Saint Jack and They All Laughed were two of my best films but never received the kind of distribution they should have.\\"Ibid. (A search of The New York Times' archive on 29 March 2006 failed to find the text of the interview.) Reception Roger Ebert gave the film a four-star review. In praise of Gazzara's performance, he writes \\"sometimes a character in a movie inhabits his world so freely, so easily, that he creates it for us as well. Ben Gazzara does that in Saint Jack.\\" He goes on to say \\"The film is by Peter Bogdanovich and what a revelation it is, coming after three expensive flops. But here everything is right again.

Background and release  \\"I Need U\\" is described as an urban R&B; pop genre song where Lay participated in its composing and lyrics-writing. The song is dedicated to Lay's grandparents' 50th wedding anniversary with lyrics confessing eternity to the beloved. In a letter on S.M. Entertainment’s social media account which was posted one day before the release of the music video, Lay talked about his grandparent’s love and how they care for one another. He also described his relationship with them and how he hoped to give them a touching memory through “I Need U”. He stated, \\"Love can sometimes be like a habit, but also refreshing and touching like a scene in a movie, a single book, or a song. But I believe that love, from what I have felt, is being able to do even the smallest of things for your loved one thousands, if not tens of thousands, of times.” Lay revealed in a video hosted by Chaumet that this song was in fact written beforehand together with \\"what U need?\\" as a response to the latter and expressed that a song is the best fit as an answer to the suspense posed by another song.  Music video  The music video begins with a piano version of Gymnopédie No.3 by Erik Satie and the phrase \\"Ce n'est pas une histoire d'amour. C'est une histoire qui parle d'amour\\". It tells the story of a young man, portrayed by Lay himself, strolling through Paris while planning to ask his beloved to marry him. After many years, the two return to Paris to reminisce the past. The music video, featuring Lay's grandparents, was filmed in Paris, France and personally planned and directed by Lay himself.  Reception  The accompanying music video for \\"I Need U\\" ranked #1 on Billboard's China Weibo Live Chart. In 12 hours, \\"I Need U\\" hit more than 26 million views online, consecutively being the major 3 music chart's winner.

He was mayor of Santo Domingo during the period of España Boba (\\"Foolish Spain\\"), among other public offices. He obtained a doctorate of canon law and civic law from the University of Santo Tomas de Aquino in 1791.  Role as educator and independentist  He was vice rector in 1817 and rector in 1818 of the University Santo Tomas de Aquino after its reopening by Jose Nunez de Caceres in 1815. When the university was closed by the Haitian authorities, he became an independent instructor at the plazas of the city of Santo Domingo using the Socratic method as his method of teaching which gave him the name of the \\"Dominican Socrates\\". The founding father of the Dominican Republic, Juan Pablo Duarte, was his disciple and obtained his superior studies (latin, philosophy and law) from him due to the closure of the university. He became the instructor of many other famous Dominican intellectuals such as Felix Maria del Monte. After his exile to Cuba by the Haitian authorities, his void was filled by priest Gaspar Hernandez. He was one of the signatories of the Declaration of Independence of December 1, 1821 together with Jose Nunez de Caceres, Manuel Carvajal, and others which led to the \\"Ephemeral Independence\\". He was also part of the provisional government of the newly founded state of \\"Haiti Espanol\\" and signed its constitution act. In 1824, he became one of the first conspirators against the Haitian occupation being the leading figure of the \\"Conspiracy of Los Alcarrizos\\" along with his brother Esteban Moscoso Carvajal with the purpose of returning Santo Domingo back again to Spain.  Exile to Cuba  He was exiled to Cuba during the Haitian occupation where he became the head of the canon and civil law of the Seminario school until his death in 1837. He was cousin of the captain, lawyer of the Real Audiencia and hero of Battle Palo Hincado Lic. Tomas (Toso) Ramirez Carvajal as well as cousin, twice removed, of the historian and politician José Gabriel García.

Definition of historical fiction There are varying definitions as to what types of literature fall within the scope of historical fiction. One of the broadest definitions of the genre is \\"fiction that is set in the past, before the author's lifetime and experience.\\" The HNS has adopted this broader definition, accepting as historical fiction any novel written at least fifty years after the events described, or by an individual who was not alive at the time of those events, and thus approaches them from a research perspective. Alternate histories, time-slip novels, historical fantasies, and multiple- period novels (including novels where one of the time periods is contemporary) are all accepted by the HNS as historical fiction. History Founded in 1997 in the United Kingdom by bookseller, editor, and historical novel enthusiast Richard Lee, the HNS's foundational membership included such authors as Joanna Trollope, Melvyn Bragg, and Bernard Cornwell. The first of many author events organized by the HNS was held in 1999 at Kirby Hall during the History in Action meeting, one of the largest historical re-enactment events in the world. That same year, the HNS launched its web presence. The society continued to grow in the UK, and also began to acquire members in the United States and throughout the world. Its first UK Historical Novel Society Conference was held at the New Cavendish Club in London, England in 2001; the first North American conference in 2005 in Salt Lake City, Utah; and the inaugural Australasian conference in Sydney, Australia, in 2015. Membership and organization The HNS's membership is composed of historical fiction authors, readers, and others with an interest in the genre. Membership in the HNS is open to all, with the society's primary member base being composed of historical novelists and those who enjoy reading historical fiction. Though it is international in scope, the society also sponsors local chapters;https://historicalnovelsociety.org/members/chapters/ there are currently 4 UK chapters, 11 US chapters, and 1 Australasian chapter. Through its local chapters and conferences, the HNS provides its members with networking opportunities to further a variety of goals related to historical fiction authorship as well as promotion of the genre in general. The HNS also has an active Facebook and Twitter presence. Publications The HNS publishes a quarterly journal, the Historical Novels Review, which includes feature articles, author interviews, and columns related to historical fiction (e.g., \\"Historical Fiction Market News\\"). The journal also reviews approximately 300 new or forthcoming historical novels per issue, as well as selected nonfiction. When it was founded, the society published a magazine, Solander, which focused on features and interviews with historical novelists; initial contributors to the magazine included Richard Woodman and E.V. Thompson, amongst others. Solander merged with the Historical Novels Review in 2012. As of 2017, the 20th anniversary of both the society and the Historical Novels Reviews first publication, the journal has published reviews of over 17,000 historical novels. A subscription to the Historical Novels Review in printed format is included with society membership, along with online access to all its content. The HNS publishes additional features, interviews, and guides on its website, which are open to both members and non-members. The society also curates Historical Fiction Daily: A Web Magazine,https://paper.li/histnovel/1311169881#/ which focuses and archives \\"the fascinating history and historical fiction stories that appear in the world's newspapers and blogs.\\" Awards In order to support writers of new historical fiction, the HNS offers two literary awards: * New Novel Award. This award, which carries a prize of £2,000, is open to prospective authors of any nationality for a previously unpublished work of historical fiction. * Short Story Award. The awards are judged by eminent authors (e.g., Dame Hilary Mantel and Elizabeth Chadwick) and top industry professionals (e.g., the late Carole Blake, agent to Barbara Erskine, and Juliet Mushens agent to Jessie Burton). Past award winners who have gone on to publication include Michel Faber, Hilary Green, and Ruth Downie. Anne Aylor won the Short Story Award in 2014 for \\"The House of Wild Beasts\\"; this and other winning and shortlisted stories were published in 2017 in the anthology Distant Echoes. Recent New Novel award winners include Martin Sutton for his novel, Lost Paradise, which subsequently received the Winston Graham Prize and Kelleigh Greenberg- Jephcott, who was offered a six-figure deal for publication of her work, Swan Song. Conferences The HNS offers biennial conferences in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australasia. These conferences feature networking opportunities, agent pitch sessions, writing workshops, editor sessions, programs for readers, panel presentations, and more. Past HNS conference presenters include prize-winning and best-selling authors Geraldine Brooks, Tracy Chevalier, Bernard Cornwell, Stephanie Dray, David Ebershoff, Kate Forsyth, Diana Gabaldon, Margaret George, C.W.

Early life Osia Joslyn was born near Batavia, New York, on February 13, 1832. Her father's name was Joslyn, and his family were originally Bostonians and related to the Breckenridges of Kentucky. Her mother was a Sprague, a first cousin of President Millard Fillmore. During the childhood of Osia Joslyn her father moved to Erie County, New York. Career Since 1884 she lived, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and was conspicuously associated with all its larger philanthropies. One of the first was the Home for the Friendless, of which she was an incorporator and whose constitution she helped to frame. She was one of the prime movers and the heaviest worker in the establishing of the Wisconsin Humane Society. The flourishing Woman's Club of Wisconsin, in Milwaukee, was helped by the essays written by Hilesr. She was its first vice-president and the president of the ladies' art and science class. One of the first stock companies of women for revenue owes its existence to Hiles. She originated and propounded to the club the idea of a stock company of women for the building of a permanent woman's club home, which building idea was afterwards extended by the stock company to facilities for revenue other than that derived from the club. She was one of the active incorporators of the Wisconsin Training School for nurses, and had several times been a delegate to the National Conference of Charities and Reforms. She passed in history as an agitator of the wrongs of the Indians. At first she gave her time to the Mission Indian work in California, personally visiting nearly every reservation and Mexican land grant in southern California. Twice she went to the Interior Department and to the President in the interest of the Indians. She pled their cause in the East and assisted in sending legal help for their protection. Hiles. being a woman of wealth, was able to put money as well as zeal into her philanthropic work. When the Wisconsin Indian Association was formed, she was made secretary. Its labors were largely legislative, and Hiles used her influence in helping to defeat some bills, in originating and pushing some beneficent ones, and in creating harmony of action with branches in other States. She was a literary woman and a poet. She published in various periodicals. She traveled extensively, both in America and Europe. She was a lover of art, of nature and of humanity. Personal life At the age of nineteen Osia Joslyn went to Illinois, where, two years later, she married John Hiles, a man born in England in a highly cultured family. After the death of her husband, and while her son was completing preparatory and college courses, Hiles did all the outside work of her deceased husband's extensive estate. Her two homes in Pewaukee and Milwaukee were in summer and winter centers of generous hospitality and centers of art.

Overview Characteristics of the building are the transparency of the glass facades and the exposed steel skeleton construction. The building, which won several awards, was designed by Peter Kulka and built between 1991 and 1993, following the German reunification. A special feature of the Landtagsgebäudes is the Bürgerfoyer, where regular exhibitions take place. History After the collapse of East Germany, the Saxon Landtag had its seat from 27 October 1990 to 17 September 1993 in the Dreikönigskirche in Innere Neustadt district. Since the church was not a permanent solution, a suitable solution was sought. At first, there was no doubt that the Parliament would move back into the house on the Brühl Terrace. The Sächsisches Ständehaus, erected by Paul Wallot, the Reichstag building architect, had been at the disposal of Parliament since 1907. It was not only its seemingly good construction, but above all the traditional relationship, that encouraged the reflections to use it again as a parliament building. However, closer scrutiny led to the realization that the museums, which had long been housed in the House of the Estates, with their important collections, were an unpredictable temporal uncertainty. Above all, however, the comparison between the use requirements of a modern parliament and the given structural requirements of 1907 suggested a different solution. Thus they decided to build a new building. On March 20, 1991, the first realization competition for architecture in Saxony was praised. On May 28 of this year, the prize court of Winfried Sziegoleit was awarded to the architect Peter Kulka, who began the planning. On October 1, the first demolition work began, and on December 11, 1991, the first groundbreaking ceremony followed. On 19 May 1992, the foundation stone was laid and in November one already celebrated the festivals of the new buildings. On the occasion of the 3rd anniversary of the German Unity on 3 October 1993, a meeting was held in the new plenary hall. The first official meeting took place a few days later on 14 October 1993. However, the official transfer took place on 12 February 1994. On February 1, 1995, Kulka's office was commissioned to plan the reconstruction, reconstruction and extension work of the former building of the Landesfinanzamt in Dresden's Devrientstraße. This was built between 1928 and 1931 and was from 1946 to 1990 headquarters of the city and district management of the SED. On 15 September 1997, the building was officially handed over to the Landtag, which has been fully usable since then In the end, the Dutch Road was rebuilt before the Landtag from September to December 1999. On 6 December 1999, it received the new name Bernhard-von-Lindenau-Platz. As result of the 2002 Elbe Floodings the building was strongly affected. In the case of damage elimination, additional elements of preventive flood protection were implemented, for example, the transfer of the sensitive technical centers to the upper floor.

Steward was the son of Gabriel Steward and his wife Sarah Wrangham. His family was from Scotland and lived at St. Helena in the early part of the eighteenth century. Later they settled at Weymouth. He served the East India Company for fifteen years in India in several positions, some of considerable rank. He married Rebecca Tucker, daughter of Richard Tucker of Weymouth before 1766. Steward was returned as Member of Parliament for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis in a by- election in 1778 to replace his wife’s uncle John Tucker. Tucker also controlled three seats at Weymouth and when he died on 9 October 1779, control of the seats passed to Steward. He also succeeded to Tucker’s post of paymaster of the marines, which he kept by placing his parliamentary interest at the Treasury’s disposal and by voting regularly with each successive Administration. He was mayor of Weymouth in 1780 and being returning officer when Parliament was dissolved unexpectedly, he was ineligible to stand in the 1780 general election. Instead he returned Warren Lisle, an elderly relation of his wife, who resigned when Steward’s term of office finished. Steward’s election expenses in the by-election of £500 seem to have been paid by the Treasury. He was returned again at Weymouth in 1784. In 1786 he vacated his seat to accommodate an Administration candidate, George Jackson. Jackson resigned in order to contest Colchester in 1788 and Steward returned himself, staying until the 1790 general election Steward died on 9 January 1792.

From 1879 to 1906 he was sub-prefect or prefect of various departments of France. For eleven years from 1906 to 1918 he was Resident-General of France in Tunisia, where he initiated various administrative improvements. He considered that the Tunisian Muslims had an utterly different mentality from French people, and could never become citizens of France. He was violently antisemitic, and opposed recruiting Tunisian Jews during World War I (1914–18). After the war he was briefly French Ambassador in Madrid, then for four years administered Alsace-Lorraine, which had been returned from Germany to France. Early years Gabriel Alapetite was born on 5 January 1854 in Clamecy, Nièvre. He came from an old republican family. His parents were Marien Ferdinand Alapetite (1821–95) and Alphonsine Janiska (1832–91). His siblings were Jeanne Marie Alapetite (1852–1918) and Emile Marien Alapetite (1856–1911). Gabriel Alapetite qualified as a lawyer in Paris in 1873. He began practice as a lawyer with Théodore Tenaille-Saligny as his political mentor. Tenaille-Saligny was named Prefect of Pas-de-Calais in 1876, then Prefect of Haute-Garonne, and appointed Alapetite his chef de cabinet. Alapetite was chef de cabinet in Pas-de-Calais from December 1876 to May 1877 and in Haute-Garonne from December 1877 to February 1879. Administrator in France Tenaille-Saligny became a Senator from 1879 to 1888, while Alapetite followed a standard administrative progression. He proved extremely able and advanced rapidly. He was in turn Sub-Prefect of Muret from 25 March 1879, Loudun from 11 November 1880 and Châtellerault from 21 October 1883. He was made Secretary-General of Rhône on 25 April 1885. Alapetite was appointed Prefect of Indre on 20 June 1888. He was only 34 at this time, very young for such a responsible position. He was appointed Prefect of Sarthe on 1 December 1888, then Prefect of Puy-de-Dôme on 24 May 1889. On 3 July 1889 he married Magdeleine Louise Etiennette Tenaille- Saligny (1867–1943), daughter of Theodore Tenaille-Saligny. They had three children, Marguerite (1893–1958), Germaine Louise Alphonsine (1894–1971) and Michel Ferdinand (1896–1982). Alapetite was appointed Prefect of Pas-de-Calais on 8 January 1890. On 14 September 1894 the miners in the Pas de Calais started a general strike. Gabriel Alapetite acted tactfully but decisively to prevent disturbances, as he had in similar circumstances two years earlier, and only one person died during the strike. He played a balancing act in correcting the initiatives of the Ministry of Public Works, the Ministry of the Interior, the President of the Council and the Ministry of War. He convinced the President of the Council to threaten to withdraw troops from the mining basin, and this persuaded the companies to accept negotiations. As prefect, Alapetite was a faithful ally of the political leader Alexandre Ribot. Alapetite was Prefect of Rhône from 1900 to 1906. Resident-General in Tunisia Alapetite was Resident-General in Tunisia from 1906 to 1918. Shortly after he took up his post, the Tunisian Consultative Conference was expanded to include Muslim and Jewish representatives for the first time. In Tunisia he developed public works, supported colonization and improved finance and education. He created provident funds and developed agricultural cooperation, which reduced scarcity and famine. Alapetite wanted to improve treatment of the mentally ill. He wrote that \\"the moral conquest of the native through medical welfare is a long-term effort\\" to advance the interests of France in North Africa. Alapetite inaugurated a monument with a bust of the geologist Philippe Thomas by the sculptor André César Vermare in Sfax on 26 April 1913. Thomas had discovered large deposits of phosphates of lime, which had greatly helped the Tunisian economy. Alapetite inaugurated another monument in honour of Thomas in Tunis on 29 May 1913. Alapetite with Tunisian soldiers leaving for the front in 1915 During World War I (1914–18) in December 1914 Alapetite wrote that German and Ottoman propaganda was convincing the tirailleurs that \\"the Commander of Believers forbids them to go and get themselves killed for the infidels.\\" Alapetite was opposed to letting indigenous soldiers return home, either as convalescents or on leave. Sending wounded men home would demoralize their families, and men on leave would exaggerate the dangers and hardships of total warfare in the cold climate of northern France. He did not feel that Tunisians should be treated in the same way as French people, since the Tunisian Muslims had a different mentality. He wrote, \\"it is dangerous to make of this affair a question of principle or sentiment.\\" Alapetite sent Muslim notaries to assist Tunisian soldiers and help with burial rites, but found it very difficult to find an imam to minister to the soldiers at the front. Alapetite strongly opposed sending Muslim troops to the Dardanelles during the Gallipoli Campaign, where they would be fighting against Muslims, and this view prevailed. Later, North African troops did fight the Ottomans in the Middle East. In 1915 Alapetite opposed giving Tunisian soldiers French citizenship. He wrote, \\"in Tunisia, the naturalized French Muslim appears as an uprooted apostate.\\" He said that naturalizing the Muslims would be an indirect annexation and would violate the treaties France had made with the Bey of Tunis. After his retirement Alapetite wrote, \\"Long experience with Oriental Muslims only allows the European to understand one precise fact about their mentality: that their brain does not reason like ours.\\" Alapetite was deeply antisemitic, as was typical of the French administration in Tunisia. In the fall of 1916 Pierre Roques, Minister of War, wrote to Alapetite suggesting that as part of the drive to recruit natives troops for 1917 it might be sensible to call Tunisian Jews to arms. Alapetite wrote a long reply in which he rejected the idea. He said that conscripting Tunisian Jews would be equivalent to granting them French citizenship, and this would provoke the Muslims. If Jews were recruited, France would lose proven Muslim troops for the sake of a Jewish force \\"that all the current data permits us to consider as mediocre in every regard.\\" He saw the Tunisian Jews as clannish, ungenerous, exploitative and even \\"parasitic.\\" He wrote, \\"Until the present, political power has escaped the Jews in Tunisia, it is the only force they lack. They know well that if they have it, the enslavement of the Muslim natives won't be long in coming.\\" Later career Gabriel Alapetite was French Ambassador in Madrid from 1918 to 1920. Alapetite was French Commissioner General in Strasbourg, Alsace-Lorraine, from 1920 to 1924. Alapetite replaced Alexandre Millerand as Commissioner General. As a career bureaucrat he did not have the vision or political skills of his predecessor. He had to deal with labour tensions, disputes over language and religion, difficulties implementing French law and difficulties with Alsatian civil servants. Although Alapetite was willing to make compromises, he could not satisfy the expectations of the Alsatians, and the transfer of powers from his office to the ministries in Paris served to weaken his position. In 1920 Alapetite stated before a regional consultative assembly that he hoped Alsatians would learn one new French word each day, and forget one German word. Members of the Harvard Glee Club visited Strasbourg on Bastille Day on 14 July 1921. Prompted by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who wanted to impress the foreign visitors, Alapetite arranged for an exhibition of traditional Alsatian dress at Orangerie Park with over 400 participants to \\"make these seventy American delegates aware of happy Alsace, French Alsace.\\" Gabriel Alapetite died on 22 March 1932 in Paris aged 78.  Honours Alapetite was decorated with the Ordre des Palmes Académiques on 12 July 1884. He was named Knight of the Legion of Honour on 3 August 1890, Officer of the Legion of Honour on 7 January 1894 and Commander of the Legion of Honour on 26 January 1906.

His novels, The Last Villains of Molo and Den of Inequities have been used for undergraduate and postgraduate education by universities in Kenya and abroad. Kombani is also a recipient of the Kenyatta University Outstanding Young Alumni Award 2014 and was recognized as a Business Daily Top 40 under 40 in 2015.  Early life  Joseph Kinyanjui Kombani was born in Molo in the then Nakuru District of Rift Valley Province in Kenya. He was the last born in a family of five children. His mother single-handedly catered for the family in a single-roomed mabati house after separating from his father before he was born. Kinyanjui passed by a Standard Chartered branch on his way to school at Molo Academy for his primary school education, which would later become his employer. After the 1992 general elections, the ethnically diverse town of Molo was rocked by tribal skirmishes along with numerous others in Rift Valley, prompting his family to move out to his maternal ancestral home in Njoro, where he schooled up to form four. After the untimely passing of his mother, Kinyanjui was forced to move in with his brothers in Ngando, a slum off Ngong Road in Nairobi. This later inspired the setting for his novel The Last Villains of Molo.  Education and Banking Career  After completing his secondary school education at Molo Academy in 1998, Kinyanjui Kombani was admitted to Kenyatta University in 2000 and graduated in 2004 with a Bachelor of Education in English & Literature. He also completed a program on Business mentorship at Inoorero University in 2012, becoming a career business mentor. Afterwards, he successfully applied for a position at Standard Chartered Bank as Customer Relations manager, despite not having graduated with a course in a relevant field. Other positions held there include Personal Financial Consultant, Business Financial Consultant, Relations Manager in Premium Banking, and most recently, the team leader for SME Banking in Kenya.  Writing career   Beginnings  Kinyanjui Kombani started writing in 2004 while at Kenyatta University, penning a play titled Carcasses for the Meat Trade Awareness project by Born Free Foundation. The play was widely performed by Kenyatta University travelling theatre. In Kenya alone, more than 60,000 rural people viewed the performance of the play. It was also staged elsewhere in Africa, Europe, and the United States. In 2004, Kombani also wrote the script for Mizoga, the film adaptation of the play which was shot by Born Free Foundation yet again. In the same year (2004), his first novel The Last Villains of Molo, was published by Acacia Stantex Publishers, two years after finishing the manuscript and signing a contract. The author has stated in interviews that he did not earn any royalties from the book for ten years. It was not until Longhorn Publishers released a second imprint in 2012 that the book, and its author, received widespread publicity. In 2007, the writer moved to Longhorn publishers and published two children's stories; Wangari Maathai: Mother of Trees, and We Can be Friends, the latter of which was reproduced for the Rwandan market a year later in 2008. By this time, Kinyanjui was a well renowned novelist with a considerable fan base.  Mastery  In 2012, The Last Villains of Molo was republished by Longhorn Publishers. With proper marketing, the book was positively received by critics and the public, and it launched the career of Kinyanjui Kombani as a contemporary novelist. The book was soon approved for use as a study text in several universities in the country, including his Alma mater, Kenyatta University. The novel is also studied in universities in Germany, the United States, and England in both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. In 2014, his second novel Den of Inequities, another odyssey into the experiences of slum life in Nairobi, was published to a positive reception yet again. The text has also been used as s study text in Kenya and Rwanda universities.  References  # Mbugua Ngunjiri (2013).

It was described by Carl Geyer in 1832. Description Heteronympha cordace has a wingspan ranging from , with females generally larger than males and with stouter abdomens. The uppersides of the wings are black to dark brown with orange to brownish-orange markings. The markings contain a blue-centered black subapical eyespot and a larger blue-centered black subtornal eyespot. The underside of the wings are lighter in hue and have more extensive orange areas. Range The Heteronympha cordace butterfly occurs in disjunct populations across Australia, in New South Wales, southern Victoria, south eastern South Australia, and Tasmania. Populations of the butterfly are known from swampy areas in the alpine of the Great Divide to coastal areas in both the east and west. It is not common in any areas and colonies tend to be static, and many populations have become extinct as a result of habitat loss. Ecology Adult butterflies have a slow, meandering flight pattern close to the ground among the larval host plants, and near food plants Melaleuca and Leptospermum that grow near the breeding habitat. One generation is completed annually, with adults occurring mainly from late December to February. It is fond of sedgeland and low shrubland in swamps and along creeks, often with dense stands of the larval food plant. It occurs mostly at altitudes from but can occur as low as sea level in Tasmania. The larval food plant of Heteronympha cordace is Carex appressa. The female butterfly lays a single egg or very few on the underside of the lower leaves of Carex appressa. The eggs are in diameter, green, nearly spherical, and have thin longitudinal ribs. The larva is green to greenish brown and generally long. The larva has a darker middorsal line with paler dorsolateral and lateral lines. The head of the larva is slightly concave and reddish brown to mottled brown. The pupa of the butterfly is green with greenish-yellow wings, and about long. Pupation occurs either on a low leaf of a host plant or nearby a host plant, and the pupa is suspended with its head downwards by the cremaster.

In total there are 14 images throughout the psalter. Byzantine illuminated manuscripts were produced across the Byzantine Empire, some in monasteries but others in imperial or commercial workshops. Religious images or icons were made in Byzantine art in many different media: mosaics, paintings, small statues and illuminated manuscripts. Monasteries produced many of the illuminated manuscripts devoted to religious works using the illustrations to highlight specific parts of text, a saints' martyrdom for example, while others were used for devotional purposes similar to icons. These religious manuscripts were most commissioned by patrons and were used for private worship but also gifted to churches to be used in services. 12th century miniature from the Skylitzes Chronicle depicting Emperor Theophilos and his court. Not all Byzantine illuminated manuscripts were religious texts, secular subjects are represented in chronicles (e.g. Madrid Skylitzes), medical texts such as the Vienna Dioscurides, and some manuscripts of the Greek version of the Alexander Romance. In addition to the majority of manuscripts, in Greek, there are also manuscripts from the Syriac Church, such as the Rabbula Gospels, and Armenian illuminated manuscripts which are heavily influenced by the Byzantine tradition.BL \\"Luxury\\" heavily-illuminated manuscripts are less of a feature in the Byzantine world than in Western Christianity, perhaps because the Greek elite could always read their texts, which was often not the case with Latin books in the West, and so the style never became common. However, there are examples, both literary (mostly early) and religious (mostly later). The Byzantine iconoclasm paused production of figural art in illuminated manuscripts for many decades, and resulted in the destruction or mutilation of many existing examples.  Subject Matter  6th century page from the Rossano Gospels. The oldest surviving illuminated New Testament manuscript.  Devotional Manuscripts  The Greek Bible was produced in small segments during the Byzantine period for private study and use during church services. For example there are 15 known illuminated manuscripts of Book of Job, with some 1,500 illustrations between them. As in the West, the gospel book and psalter were the most common extracted texts,BL; Maxwell with two famous Late Antique versions of the Book of Genesis (Vienna Genesis and Cotton Genesis). Early Old Testament manuscripts, and for example the Joshua Roll, are speculated to draw on a Jewish tradition in the Hellenistic world, of which no examples survive. The Old (Septuagint) and New Testaments were separated into the Octateuch, also known as the eight books from Genesis to Ruth, the psalter and the Four Gospels. Manuscripts specifically created for Mass (liturgy) included the sacramentary, the gradual and the missal. The pages were ornately decorated with gold paint and reddish-purple backgrounds. = Prophet or Gospel Books = One of the earliest known illuminated New Testament manuscripts is the 6th-century Rossano Gospels. The Illuminated Prophet Books are another example of illuminated manuscripts depicting major and minor prophets through portraiture along with narrative miniatures. The style of illustrations follow somewhat of an icon model but a title noting the name of the prophet was needed to prevent confusion. None of the prophet books contain a date but based on the style of the miniatures and script they approximately range from the mid tenth century to the mid thirteenth century. = The Chronicle of John Skylitzes of Madrid = In the twelfth century, The Chronicle of John Skylitzes of Madrid documented Byzantine history from the ninth to eleventh century with over 600 illustrated scenes placed throughout the text. The illustrations are placed on each page many of the compositions repeating themselves. In order to create many images, illuminators made a model to copy instead of crafting new narrative compositions each time. The repeated images show the possible use of models with the artist changing the paint colors in order to represent another group of people or scene taking place. The integration of text and image was important within this manuscript in order to illustrate the Byzantine history effectively by highlighting key events. Author portraits The classical tradition of the author portrait at the start of many literary manuscripts was continued in the Byzantine period, with the evangelist portrait at the start of one of the four Gospels the most common examples, but other authors such as Dioscurides also receiving them.  Patronage  During the Byzantine Empire, religious art was produced with the help of patrons who provided the funds needed to produce these works. Some of the Byzantine illuminated manuscripts were created at the request of patrons and were used for both for private viewing and church services. Requesting the illuminating lectionary, Gospel Books, was a way for patrons to show their devotion to Christianity and religious institutions. Dionsyiou cod. 587 is an example of an illuminated Gospel made for the patriarch of Constantinople to read during mass. The illustrations were created to enhance the passages of the Gospel and bring the word of God to the viewer. The four Gospels, John, Mathew, Luke and Mark take the reader through the year from Easter to Easter. This manuscript also made use of models depicting similar figures with minor alterations or color variations. The models were not always accurate since the artists had to create these images from memory of past texts allowing for some altering of iconography.

It is found in tropical and subtropical Africa, Asia and the Pacific Ocean region. It breeds in excreta, especially human faeces, and is the main insect vector of trachoma, a major cause of blindness. Distribution Bazaar flies are found in parts of Africa, Asia and the Pacific Ocean region. The flies need temperatures between about , with being optimal, and a humidity level of over 85%. Bazaar flies are more abundant at low and medium altitudes. They may be more abundant in winter, spring and autumn, or summer depending on rainfall patterns, competition for dung, and predation. Life cycle After mating, female bazaar flies seek out suitable places to lay their eggs. Bazaar flies are most attracted to human faeces on the ground (they will not breed in covered pit latrines). If no human faeces are available, the excreta of other animals will suffice. The larvae develop in the faeces and die if the excreta dries out or becomes too hot. When developed, the larvae pupate, undergo metamorphosis and emerge as adult flies. The time from egg-laying to adult emergence averages nine days. The bazaar fly is a prolific species: theoretically, if all its progeny survived, a single female bazaar fly kept at could produce 17.8 million offspring within 11 weeks. The quality of the emerging adult flies (as measured by head breadth) is better from human faeces than from those of any other animal; these larger flies are likely to be more fecund and have longer lives, thus producing more offspring. Relationship with humans Fly on cheek: the bazaar fly is the principal insect vector of trachoma This fly lives in close proximity to humans; it probably coevolved with humans in Africa, spreading with them to other parts of Africa and Asia. It is not found in the Americas. Bazaar flies are a nuisance, disturbing people at leisure and at work, but they are principally disliked because of their habit of settling on people's faces (particularly around the eyes) and on sweaty skin, seeking out bodily secretions and suppurating wounds. The bazaar fly is a vector for trachoma, a disease caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis, which can result in blindness. Research in Gambia suggests that young children are the main reservoir of the bacteria and that this fly is the principal insect vector of trachoma infection. Worldwide, trachoma results in the visual impairment of over 2 million people and the blindness of 1.2 million and is the main cause of preventable blindness.

It may be a result of gentrification, the informal redevelopment that occurs when new, and typically more affluent people, move into a neighborhood. It is the result of urban redevelopment of a residential neighborhood to non-residential uses including retail, education, healthcare, and transportation. It is often criticized because the current residents have limited options to buy or rent equivalent housing in alternative areas at the same price. If they stay, prices for products, services, and taxes in the local area rise and existing social networks are disturbed. Origin of the term The 1949 Housing Act described the movement of populations out of blighted areas as planned shrinkage. The academic literature describes this movement as serial displacement. Recently, the terms urban displacement and community displacement are used commonly. What community displacement is not Community displacement is not gentrification. It may be a byproduct, but it is not a necessary result of gentrification. New York City's gentrification of the financial district produced no outflow of population. It did not significantly change the cost of living in the neighborhood. Economist Lance Freeman came to this conclusion: \\"displacement and higher mobility play minor if any roles as forces of change in gentrifying neighborhoods.\\" Community displacement is not white flight—when residents voluntarily move away as a neighborhood declines. What community displacement is Community displacement is the movement of a population out of a neighborhood as formal or informal redevelopment occurs. The predominant generator of population displacement is government sponsored projects: new highways, education campuses, hospitals, and other urban renewal projects. Housing projects may displace people temporarily. In the 1960s, the preference was for high-density projects which did not result in net displacement. Low- density projects may or may not cause a net displacement. Community displacement is used to describe movement in urban areas. A related term, Development-induced displacement, typically describes movement connected with rural projects, such as dam projects. Community displacement is a key argument against informal and formal urban renewal projects. The implication is that the benefits calculus undervalues the interests of the community residents who will be displaced.

Qatar–Saudi Arabia relations have been especially strained since the beginning of the Arab Spring, that left a power vacuum both states sought to fill, with Qatar being supportive of the revolutionary wave and Saudi Arabia opposing it. Both states are allies of the United States, and have avoided direct conflict with one another. Qatar has differences with the Saudi bloc on a number of issues: it broadcasts Al Jazeera, that supports the Arab Spring; it maintains relatively good relations with Iran, Saudi Arabia's key rival; and it has supported the Muslim Brotherhood in the past. Saudi Arabia frames the conflict with Qatar as a subset of the Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict due to Saudi Arabia's longstanding concern about the country's relationship with Iran and Iranian-backed militant groups. However, Qatar maintains the conflict is an attempt for Saudi Arabia to reassert the hegemony over Qatar it enjoyed during the 20th century. The Tunisian Revolution of January 2011 ousted longtime president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who fled to Saudi Arabia. Widespread Al Jazeera coverage of the Bahraini uprising of 2011 fueled Saudi suspicions the Qatari government sought to overthrow the Saudi government via soft power. The Saudis then supported a largely successful counterrevolution to the Arab Spring to preserve the monarchy of Bahrain, overthrow the Egyptian democratically elected president Mohammad Morsi and stymie international support for the post-Gadaffi government in Libya. Since the 2013 Egyptian coup d'état by Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, there has been a consistent pattern of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Egypt opposing the designs of Qatar and Turkey, who supported democratic Islamist and Salafi extremist groups, particularly in the Syrian Civil War. Both Saudi Arabia and Qatar mediated through the GCC during the Yemeni Revolution against President Ali Abdullah Saleh, although Qatar was considered more pro- revolution and KSA more pro-Saleh. Both rivals also backed the overthrow of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, a key ally of Iran and its Lebanese proxy Hezbollah. Qatari involvement in the Syrian Civil War was initially far greater in 2013 than Saudi involvement, and their backing of rival revolutionary groups benefited the incumbent government of Bashar al-Assad and what would become the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. In 2014, the two countries backed rival sides in the Second Libyan Civil War, which continues to intensify, and they had even temporarily severed diplomatic relations with each other. When Salman of Saudi Arabia ascended to the throne in 2015, the two began to cooperate more in Syria and fought alleged Houthi militias in the Yemeni Civil War. Relations were seen at near a high point when Qatar severed relations with Iran following the 2016 Saudi execution of Nimr al-Nimr. In June 2017, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, Egypt, the Maldives, Mauritania, Senegal, Djibouti, the Comoros, Jordan, the Tobruk-based Libyan government and the Hadi-led Yemeni government severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and blocked Qatar's airspace and sea routes along with Saudi Arabia blocking the only land crossing over its relations with Iran, Al-Jazeera reporting negative information about other GCC states and Egypt and the country's alleged support of Islamist groups. Qatar was also expelled from the anti-Houthi coalition. Qatar's defence minister Khalid bin Mohammad Al Attiyah called the blockade akin to a bloodless declaration of war, and Qatar's finance minister Ali Sharif Al Emadi stated that Qatar is rich enough to withstand the blockade. On 24 August 2017, Qatar announced that they would restore full diplomatic relations with Iran. As the diplomatic standoff reached its second year, Saudi Arabia announced it would build a canal that would turn Qatar into an island. Background History Since he took power in 1995, Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani believed Qatar could find security only by transforming itself from a Saudi appendage to a rival of Saudi Arabia. According to Jim Krane, energy research fellow at Rice University's Baker Institute, \\"Qatar used to be a kind of Saudi vassal state, but it used the autonomy that its gas wealth created to carve out an independent role for itself... Above all, gas prompted Qatar to promote a regional policy of engagement with Shiite Iran to secure the source of its wealth\\". Qatar and Iran share ownership of the South Pars/North Dome Gas-Condensate field, by far the world's largest natural gas field, with significant geostrategic influence.Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., \\"Why the Arabs Don’t Want Us in Syria\\", politico.com, 22 February 2016 To further offset Saudi influence, Qatar is a close ally of the United States, hosting the largest American base in the Middle East, Al Udeid Air Base. Saudi Arabia withdrew its ambassador to Doha from 2002 to 2008 to try to pressure Qatar to curb its individualistic tendencies. This approach broadly failed. Member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council. Qatar maintains relatively good relations with Iran. Saudi Arabia often frames the issue as a proxy battle between partners and adversaries of Iran. United Arab Emirates politicians claim that \\"Qatar invests billions of dollars in the U.S. and Europe and then recycles the profits to support Iranian- aligned Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood and groups linked to al Qaeda. While Qatar hosts the American military base from which the U.S. directs its regional war against extremism, it also owns media networks responsible for inciting many of the same extremists\\". Qatar also used its contacts to help negotiate peaceful exchanges of hostages for the safe evacuation of civilians from areas affected by the Syrian Civil War. In 2006, Qatar was the only UN Security Council member to vote against United Nations Security Council Resolution 1696 that called on Iran to halt its nuclear enrichment program. In April 2017, after a 12-year freeze, Qatar lifted a self-imposed ban on developing the gas field with Iran, that would require cooperation between the two countries. According to David Roberts, a Qatar foreign policy expert at King's College, London, if a conflict erupts between America and Iran, Qatar would literally be caught in the middle. \\"If you are Qatar, you look across the water and you think, when Iran did have the opportunity to take a few Arab islands, they did it.\\" \\"Qatar needs to have the ability to peacefully go about their business of sucking all the gas out of that giant field.\\" Iran could make that process very difficult. A senior fellow of Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations concludes that \\"There's a recognition of the general tendencies of the Gulf states to hedge their bets,\\"There's always a question in the back of the minds of the leadership--how much faith can they put in the U.S.?\\" On 27 May 2017, the newly reelected Iranian President Hassan Rouhani held a phone call with Qatar's Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. Rouhani told Qatar's emir, \\"The countries of the region need more cooperation and consultations to resolve the crisis in the region and we are ready to cooperate in this field.\\"\\"Iran president holds phone conversation with Qatari emir over Gulf relations\\". The National. 27 May 2017. Arab Spring and Al Jazeera The Qatari al-Jazeera is a media organization owned by the Emir of Qatar. It is the most popular network in the Middle East, and its news network has criticized foreign governments involved in the dispute and been accused of supporting Qatari interests. The Saudi-led coalition against Qatar has demanded that al-Jazeera be shut down. Terrorism Qatar has been accused of sponsoring terrorism. Some countries have faulted Qatar for funding rebel groups in Syria, including al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, the al-Nusra Front, although the Saudis have done the same. Both Qatar and Saudi Arabia have been involved in the CIA–led Timber Sycamore covert operation to train and arm Syrian rebels. Qatar has hosted officials from the Afghan Taliban and Hamas. Qatar defends this move by saying it is trying to act as an intermediary in regional conflicts. For example, Qatar hosted talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government in 2016. On 13 July 2017, Bob Corker, a Republican senator and the chairman of the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, stated that the \\"[t]he amount of support for terrorism by Saudi Arabia dwarfs what Qatar is doing\\". Former US Defense Secretary and ex-CIA chief Robert Gates stated in May 2017 that he does not \\"know instances in which Qatar aggressively goes after (terror finance) networks of Hamas, Taliban, Al-Qaeda,\\" and that \\"My attitudes toward Al-Udeid and any other facility is that the United States military doesn't have any irreplaceable facility.\\" Qatar hosts the largest American base in the Middle East, the Al Udeid Air Base, which has been used by the United States in its campaigns in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. According to the WSJ, during President Barack Obama's first term, some members of his National Security Council lobbied to pull a U.S. fighter jet squadron out of Al Udeid to protest Qatari support of militant groups in the Middle East. Timeline 2002–2008 In 2002, Saudi Arabia removed their ambassador from Qatar over Al Jazeera's alleged critical stance towards Saudi Arabia. Diplomatic relations were re-established in 2008, after assurances that Al Jazeera would limit its coverage of Saudi Arabia. 2014 During a March 2014 meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council, after which the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain announced the recall of their ambassadors to Qatar, citing interference with their internal affairs. The situation was eventually defused after Qatar forced Brotherhood members to leave the country eight months later. Some economists have interpreted the 2014 Saudi–Qatari rift as the tangible political sign of a growing economic rivalry between oil and natural gas producers, which could \\"have deep and long-lasting consequences\\" beyond the Middle East-North Africa area. 2017-2018 Qatar–Saudi Arabia diplomatic crisis In June 2017, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Egypt, Maldives, Mauritania, Mauritius, Sudan, Senegal, Djibouti, Comoros, Jordan, the Tobruk-based Libyan government and the Hadi-led Yemeni government severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and blocked Qatar's airspace and sea routes along with Saudi Arabia blocking the only land crossing over its relations with Iran, Al-Jazeera reporting negative information about other GCC states and Egypt and the country's alleged support of Islamist groups. Qatar was also expelled from the anti-Houthi coalition. Qatar's defence minister Khalid bin Mohammed Al Attiyah called the blockade akin to a bloodless declaration of war and Qatar's finance minister Ali Sharif Al Emadi stated that Qatar is rich enough to withstand the blockade. The Saudi coalition withdrawing diplomatic relations accuse Qatar of supporting terrorism, of interfering with their internal affairs and of maintaining relations with Iran. Qatar denies allegations that it supported terrorism, and pointed out that it has been contributing to the U.S.-led fight against ISIL.The curious timing of the Qatar crisis \\"Shortly after US President Donald Trump delivered his historic address to the US-Arab-Islamic Summit in Riyadh, seeking to align Washington's traditional Arab allies against Iran and its regional agenda, a new Middle East crisis erupted. The countries have also stressed the measures are in response to Qatar's violation of an agreement in 2014 to not undermine the \\"interests, security and stability\\" of other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. The diplomatic crisis came after a speech in May given by Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani in which he was alleged to have declared support for Iran, Hamas, and the Muslim Brotherhood, along with calling Iran an \\"Islamic power\\" and criticizing Donald Trump's hostile stance toward it. Qatar denied the allegations and claimed that hackers had posted fabricated statements on the state-run Qatar News Agency's website. US investigators believe the news agency was breached by Russian hackers as part of an ongoing fake news campaign designed to cause diplomatic rifts among the United States and its allies in the region. The Kremlin denied involvement, and the government of Qatar claimed the hack instead originated in the boycotting Gulf states not Russia after tracking suspicious cellphone signals. Qatar is planning to sue countries involved in the blockade. The sudden economic isolation forced Qatar to turn to Turkey and Iran for food and water supplies. Iran offered to use three of its ports for delivering supplies to Qatar. Arab media claimed that Qatar has secretly accepted to become part of an Iranian Shia sphere of influence that Tehran is trying to create in the Middle East, and which would include Lebanon (Hezbollah), Syria (Assad), and Iraq (Shia- majority government) and that, in a phone conversation with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, Emir Al Thani said he wanted the ties with Iran to be \\"stronger than ever before.\\" Qatar claims Iranian-backed Hezbollah is a resistance movement against Israeli occupation, not a terrorist group. Arab media also claimed that a member of Qatar's ruling House of Thani, Sheikh Abdullah bin Nasser bin Abdullah Al Ahmed Al Thani, tweeted that Qatar's ruler Tamim has \\"joined forces with Iran against your brothers and set up terrorist groups and published electronic battalions to beat your opponents.\\" Saudi media also alleged that Iran Revolutionary Guards are protecting Qatar's ruler Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani inside his palace. The Saudi-led bloc of states issued prerequisites to be met by Qatar before restoring diplomatic relations and lifting the blockade. The thirteen demands stipulated that the country must cut relations, military, and intelligence cooperation with Iran, comply with the US and international trade sanctions on Iran, immediately shut down a Turkish military base, and halt military cooperation with Turkey. It was also demanded that Qatar cut any existing ties with all \\"terrorist, sectarian and ideological organisations\\" such as ISIL, the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas, Taliban, Al-Qaeda, Al-Nusra Front, and Hezbollah, and must concur with any group's addition to the list of terrorist organisations as defined by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt. Other demands were more punitive, requiring reparations and compensation for loss of life and other financial losses caused by Qatar's policies in recent years, the closure of state-funded media outlets like Al Jazeera, Arabi21, Rassd, Al-Araby Al-Jadeed, Mekameleen, and the Middle East Eye. The bloc sought a guarantee that Qatar will in the future align in all matters with other Gulf states, discuss all its decisions with them, and provide regular reports on its activity (monthly for the first year, quarterly for the second and annual for the following ten years). They also demanded deportation of all political refugees who live in Qatar to their countries of origin, freezing their assets, providing any desired information about their residency, movements and finances, revoking their Qatari citizenship if naturalised, and forbade Qatar from granting citizenship to any more fugitives. Upon rejection of demands by Qatar, the countries involved announced that the blockade would remain in place until Qatar changes its policies. Countries of contention Egypt Protesters holding the Rabia sign, a sign used by the Muslim Brotherhood and its supporters in Egypt in the wake of the overthrow of Mohamed Morsi. Qatar has supported the Muslim Brotherhood in the past. Qatar supported the successful ouster of President Hosni Mubarak in February 2011, which was a landmark moment for Al Jazeera. Qatari-backed Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated candidate Mohamed Morsi became Egypt's first democratically elected president in 2012, only to be overthrown the next year by a Saudi-supported military coup led by Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, after widespread protests against his rule. Since the coup, Saudi Arabia sees the Muslim Brotherhood as a threat, as it ideologically opposes the hereditary rule of Al Saud. The government of Egypt has long viewed the Muslim Brotherhood as \\"enemy number one\\". In 2011, during the Arab Spring, Qatar supported the Egyptian protesters agitating for change, as well as the Muslim Brotherhood. By contrast, Saudi Arabia supported Hosni Mubarak and currently supports Abdel Fattah el-Sisi In February 2015, Egypt–Qatar relations deteriorated after the Egyptian Air Force conducted airstrikes on suspected ISIL positions in neighboring Libya following the beheading of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians. The airstrikes were condemned by Al Jazeera, who broadcast images of civilian casualties. Additionally, Qatar's foreign ministry expressed reservations over the airstrikes. This prompted Tariq Adel, Egypt's Arab League delegate, to accuse Qatar of supporting terrorism. Egyptian citizens also launched an online campaign denouncing the Qatari government. The Gulf Cooperation Council rejected Egypt's accusations and its secretary general regarded the statements to be false. Shortly after, Qatar recalled its ambassador to Egypt for \\"consultations\\". Syria Qatar was initially the main backer of protests against President Bashar al-Assad, alongside Turkey. As the Syrian government met protests with deadly force, Qatar continued to be the main supporter of the resulting armed rebellion and eventual full-scale civil war. Saudi Arabia was initially reluctant to support the overthrow of the Assad government, despite its reliance on Iran. When Qatar and Turkey became increasingly influential in Syria, Saudi Arabia joined the conflict to overthrow Assad as he became more dependent on Iran and Russia to cling to power. During Syrian Civil War, both Qatar and Saudi Arabia have supported many Syrian opposition rebel organisations, but also sometimes the same groups. The main Qatari-supported group was the Al Nusra Front links were made to the group via Abu Maria al-Qahtani who actively sought Qatari support and later Turkish support to split the group from al-Qaeda as well as to fight ISIL,http://english.alarabiya.net/en/features/2017/07/06/Qatar.htmlhttps://tcf.org/content/commentary/no- united-states-isnt-dropping-syrias-jihadis-terror-list/?agreed=1 opposing major Saudi-backed groups Islamic Front / SIF and Jaysh al-Islam. The division benefited not only Assad, Russia, and Iran, but also what became the Islamic State in 2014. In 2015, increased Saudi-Qatari coordination upon Salman's ascension to the throne led to the creation of the Army of Conquest. This Army captured the Idlib Governorate from the Assad government, which nearly collapsed until Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War later that year. Saudi Arabia later joined the UAE in supporting the Syrian Democratic Forces, which has clashed with Qatar's ally Turkey in northern Syria. On 9 November 2018, After Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani visited Iraq and Iraqi government officials and proposed the creation of a new coalition to counter the GCC's influence in the region consisting of Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Turkey as well as Qatar.https://almasdarnews.com/article/qatar-proposes-to-form-new-coalition- in-mid-east-report/ Libya Leader Muammar Gaddafi was killed following 2011 revolution that saw a Qatari and other military intervention on the side of the revolutionary National Transitional Council. Since the civil war escalated in 2014, the Saudi bloc and Qatar have supported rival factions in Libya. Qatar supports the Internationally recognized government of Government of National Accord, while Saudi Arabia supports the Tobruk-based government of House of Representatives. Palestine Qatar has generally supported Hamas, while Saudi Arabia used to support many Palestinian organisations, such as Hamas and the PLO/Fatah however as Hamas won the 2007 election, the level of funding from Saudi Arabia dropped, while level of funding from Iran increased. Turkey and Qatar are now Hamas's biggest supporters, up until 2011, the start of the Arab Spring, Iran and Syria used to be Hamas's biggest supporters. From 2016 onwards, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has courted Qatar and Turkey in order to ward off a potential challenge to his leadership by Mohammed Dahlan, who is supported by Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt. Yemen Al Jazeera coverage of 2011 protests against President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Mediation by the Gulf Cooperation Council, including both Saudi Arabia and Qatar, ends when Saleh refuses to resign. Saleh ousted in 2012 Yemeni Revolution after returning from Saudi Arabia for medical care. In 2015, Salman of Saudi Arabia ascends to the throne and Houthis take over the capital, leading to a civil war met by Saudi intervention to support the post-Saleh national unity government led by Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi. Qatar supported this KSA-led coalition until it was expelled from it during the 2017–18 Qatar diplomatic crisis.

After the sequel, Killing Titan was published, War Dogs was re- published as War Dogs: Ares Rising.  Plot introduction  Approximately 30 years before the beginning of the novel, a small group of alien refugees (later termed the \\"Gurus\\") landed on Earth and soon made themselves indispensable with their contributions to human technology and scientific understanding. In exchange, they \\"requested\\" Earth's help in repelling the hostile invaders (termed the \\"antagonists\\" or simply \\"Antags\\" or \\"Ants\\") who had chased the Gurus from their own star system, and were already establishing a beachhead on Mars. The narrator of the novel is Master Sergeant Michael Venn of the multi-national force of \\"Skyrines\\" (spaceborne Marines) sent to Mars.  Plot summary  Venn returns home from his last tour of duty on \\"The Red\\" (Mars) and settles into his apartment in Seattle, Washington, remembering the events of that tour: Venn and his squad's combat drop onto Mars goes badly wrong after their fleet is attacked in orbit by the Antags. Venn and a handful of survivors are forced to trek across the Mars desert, barely surviving from day to day by finding isolated caches of air and water dropped for previous expeditions. They are unable to establish contact with other elements of their force or their commanders, nor can they receive any intel on the enemy's numbers or locations. One ominous sign of the Antags' superior capabilities is when a comet impacts near the horizon, its course apparently directed by the Antags.

The 1968 Winter Olympics, officially known as the X Olympic Winter Games, was a winter multi-sport event held in Grenoble, France, from 6 to 18 February 1968. A total of 1,158 athletes representing 37 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated in 35 events from 10 different sports and disciplines. The Olympic programme was largely unchanged from four years prior in Innsbruck; one event was added, a relay event in biathlon. Norway won the most medals, with 14, and the most gold medals with 6. The Soviet Union finished second in both tallies, with 5 golds and 13 medals in total. Of the 37 NOCs to participate at Grenoble, 15 won at least one medal, with 13 of those winning at least one gold medal. East and West Germany entered separate teams for the first time, having competed together in the three prior Winter Olympics. Both nations won gold medals, their first competing as different nations. Czechoslovakia won its first gold Winter Olympics medal, achieved by Jiří Raška in the ski jumping normal hill event. Romania won its first, and as of the 2018 Winter Olympics, only medal in a Winter Olympics in the two-man bobsleigh event. Jean-Claude Killy of France was the most successful athlete at these games, winning all three of the men's alpine skiing events. Two other athletes each won three medals: Sweden's Toini Gustafsson earned two golds and a silver, and Finland's Eero Mäntyranta won a silver and two bronzes. Both of them were competitors in cross-country skiing. Four other athletes—Luciano de Paolis, Ole Ellefsæter, Harald Grønningen, and Eugenio Monti—won two gold medals, and 29 individuals in total won at least two medals in Grenoble. In speed skating, three different events ended with ties for the silver medal position, one, the women's 500 metres ended in a three-way tie for silver. In all three cases, multiple silver medals and no bronze medals were awarded. In figure skating, American Peggy Flemming won the gold medal in ladies' singles; this came a mere seven years after the 1961 crash of Sabena Flight 548 that killed the entire US figure skating team.

He was also executive chairman at Medinol, Inc from 2017 to 2018. In February 2018, Berger was appointed to the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Board of Trustees.  Early life and education  Berger received his B.A. in Biology from Colgate University in 1972 and received his M.D. from Yale School of Medicine in 1977. He completed further medical and research training at the Massachusetts General Hospital and Yale- New Haven Hospital.  Career  From 1986 until 1991, Berger held executive management positions at Centocor, Inc. including executive vice president and president of the Research and Development Division. He led the development of Remicade® (infliximab), formerly known as Centara, a drug for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis, ReoPro® (abciximab), formerly known as CentoRx, a drug for the prevention of ischemic complications in patients with CAD undergoing percutaneous interventions, and the cancer diagnostic test, CA125, to evaluate patients with ovarian cancer. In 1991, Berger founded ARIAD Pharmaceuticals in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He served as chairman and CEO from 1991 to 2015. In 1992, ARIAD raised $46 million, the largest single round of financing for a startup in the biotechnology industry at the time. ARIAD's plan was to develop drugs that would interfere with communication signals within cells, rather than on the cell surface or in between cells. In 1994, ARIAD filed for an initial public offering and was listed on the NASDAQ market. In 2000, Berger focused ARIAD on oncology, based on recent discoveries in the human genome. Under Berger's leadership, ARIAD grew to over 365 U.S. employees and established a European headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. While Berger was CEO, ARIAD developed five new medicines including the blood-cancer drug Iclusig, Brigatinib, a lung cancer treatment and AP32788 (now known as TAK788), a new medicine for lung cancer with novel mutated genetic targets. Brigatinib is approved for use in the U.S. and Europe, and TAK788 is continuing a global phase 3 trial. At the end of 2015, Berger retired from ARIAD and became an advisor to the board of directors. In early 2017, ARIAD was acquired by Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. for $5.2 billion, becoming part of Takeda Oncology. In February 2017, Medinol, Inc. announced that Berger would be serving as its executive chairman. On the global management team, his focuses at Medinol would include business management, global strategy, new business and technology initiatives, as well as improving operational efficiency as the company expands worldwide. Berger's role at Medinol was said to include working with their core business of interventional cardiovascular devices, along with its new businesses developing percutaneous aortic valves, sub-millimeter implantable sensors, and related products. He retired from Medinol at the end of 2018. In 2019, Berger retired as chairman and chief executive officer emeritus of ARIAD. Berger has served on the Board of Trustees at Concord Academy. Berger has held senior academic and administrative roles at Emory University, Yale University and the University of Pennsylvania. He was also a member of the Dean's Council of Yale University School of Medicine. During his time at Emory, Berger led a program for developing cardiovascular single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) imaging, supported by General Electric Medical Systems. He and other colleagues at Emory collaborated on the development of new quantitative techniques for cardiac SPECT imaging. Berger has contributed to a wide range of medical journals including the New England Journal of Medicine and American Journal of Cardiology, and has been interviewed by Fox Business and CNBC. He was also an established investigator of the American Heart Association.  Awards  In 2013, Berger was awarded the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award for the New England Region. The award recognizes success in innovation, financial performance, personal commitment to their business communities and other areas. Also in 2013, Berger was awarded a Gold Stevie Award.

He is best known for developing and promoting the modern sous-vide (French for \\"under vacuum\\") method of cooking. Before becoming the Chief Scientist at Cuisine Solutions in 2000, Bruno worked as a consultant helping to create sous-vide cooking manufacturing facilities in the United States, France, Chile, Brazil, and Norway. In 1991, he founded Centre de Recherche et d'Etudes pour L'Alimentation (Culinary Research and Education Academy or CREA) in Paris to train chefs on the application of sous-vide cooking. In addition to his work with Cuisine Solutions and CREA, Goussault is on the board of the Association of Chemists, Engineers and Managers of Agricultural and Food Industries.  Education  Before beginning his culinary science career, Goussault earned a post-graduate degree from the d'Etudes et du Developpement Economique et Social, an MS degree in food technology from the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Industries Agricoles et Alimentaires (now AgroParisTech), and a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Paris Pantheon.  Career beginnings  Goussault's food science career officially launched in 1967 when he began working with beef and ham. He spent three years in Niger, Africa experimenting with millet and sorghum milling techniques and continued his work with grains upon returning to France. This resulted in Goussault inventing a new technique for making a \\"super-quick- cooking '2-minute rice.'\\"  Sous-vide  In 1970, Goussault began working with vacuum pouch cooking method. It was also around this time, in 1972, when Goussault was involved with meat research and became a meat specialist despite being colorblind. Goussault claimed that he learned to \\"correlate the structures and textures people associate with particular colors to exact temperatures,\\" and because of this, he discovered that meat cooked at lower temperatures loses less of its juices, develops a better texture, and cooks more evenly. In 1974, a study that Goussault conducted regarding the sous-vide cooking of beef shoulder was presented at an international frozen-foods conference in Strasbourg, France, demonstrating how cooking the beef sous-vide extended its shelf life to 60 days. Goussault was later approached by Cryovac executives in 1978 and asked to add a scientific basis to Pralus' culinary training. Also in the 1980s, Goussault teamed up with three-star chef Joël Robuchon and SNCF, France's national train system, to create a new menu featuring sous-vide-prepared foods for SNCF's first-class service between Paris and Strasbourg. In 1991, Goussault founded Centre de Recherche et d'Etudes pour L'Alimentation (Culinary Research and Education Academy or CREA) in Paris to teach students proper sous-vide cooking techniques, instructing them on how to use the method safely. Through CREA, Goussault has trained over 80% of chefs with three Michelin Guide stars. In August 2015, under Goussault's training, Daylesford Crossing in Paoli, Pennsylvania became the first senior-living center in the United States to implement a sous-vide system.  Cuisine Solutions  Goussault has been the Consultant of Cuisine Solutions (originally called Vie de France) since 1989 when he was hired by Stanislas Vilgrain to design a new system for producing high-quality sous-vide food on an industrial scale. Goussault began working with Cuisine Solutions' American operations in 2000, as the Chief Scientist. With a production line at Cuisine Solutions headquarters designed for 130,000 meals per day, the company now prepares sous-vide food for clients including the Super Bowl, Costco, the first-class cabins on Air France and American Airlines, the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, and hotel chains such as Westin and Hyatt. Cuisine Solutions has also worked with chef Thomas Keller on a sous-vide product line, and Goussault has helped to train the kitchen staff at both of Keller's restaurants, French Laundry and Per Se.  Acclaim  Goussault received the Ordre National du Mérite from the President of France in 1995. In 2017, Goussault was named \\"one of the 100 greatest visionaries\\" by The Einstein Legacy Project and chosen for inclusion in Genius: 100 Visions of the Future, the world's first 3D-printed book.

The origin and etymology of the name are uncertain; it may be connected to anemos, \\"wind\\", although the philologist Phaedon Koukoules suggested a derivation to aneme, \\"spool\\". Others, such as François Chalandon, have suggested that the family attested in later times were descendants of Anemas, son of the last Emir of Crete, who converted to Christianity and joined the Byzantine army. Four Anemas brothers took part in a conspiracy against Alexios I Komnenos in 1105; two of them are known by name, Michael and Leo. Once the attempt on the life of the emperor had been discovered and foiled, the conspirators were shaven and ritually humiliated. Michael Anemas was due to be punished by blinding, but his bravery moved the emperor's daughters who begged the intercession of their mother. The emperor was persuaded to grant clemency and Michael was merely imprisoned. The tower near the Blachernae Palace where he was incarcerated became known as the 'Prison of Anemas', because of his long residence there. The family retained a prominent position, however, during the Komnenian period: Manuel Anemas was chosen to marry a daughter of John II Komnenos, and other members appear to have made marriage alliances with the Angelos and Doukas families, who belonged to the highest Byzantine aristocracy. The family declined after the late 12th century, but members occur until the end of the empire in the 15th century. An Anemas, landowner in Stomion of Chalcidice, is attested in 1321, an unnamed member of the family drowned in the Marmara Sea in the early 14th century, while a Theodore Anemas was chartophylax at Imbros in 1407.

M. Forster\\". Early life Peter Burra and his twin sister Nella Burra were close friend with Peter Pears; Burra and Pears went to school together at Lancing College and then Oxford University. Helen \\"Nella\\" Pomfret Burra (1909–1999) was a singer and actress who worked with the Group Theatre productions. She married actor and director John Percival Moody (1906–1993). At Lancing College, both Pears, piano, and Burra, violin, were members of the Lancing Chamber Music Society. Career From February 1930 to June 1931, Peter Burra edited the literary magazine Farrago, published by Simon Nowell Smith. They were 6 numbers in total and the cover designs and plates were by Edward Burra, Albert Rutherston, Oliver Holt and Laurence Whistler. In issue 5 there is also an headpiece by Rex Whistler. The magazine published early poems by Evelyn Waugh and Cecil Day-Lewis, plus contributions by A.J.A. Symons, John Sparrow, Max Beerbohm and Lord David Cecil. Burra was an essayist; in 1934, in \\"The Novels of E.M. Forster\\", he was the first to highlight E. M. Forster's highly musical technique of employing textual leitmotifs, which he referred to as \\"rhythm\\". He would go on and write the introduction to Everyman edition of A Passage to India (1942), released after his death. E.M.Forster said of him that he was \\"the best critic of his generation\\". Also in 1934, Burra wrote Van Gogh, published by Duckworth, and in 1936, again with Duckworth, he published Wordsworth, Great Lives. These two biographies established his reputation as a writer. Burra was a special correspondent for The Times, and it was while in Barcelona to cover the ISCM Music Festival that he met Benjamin Britten for the first time; in a letter dated 1 May 1936, Burra tells Pears he has also met Britten's close friend Lennox Berkeley. In 1936 Pears was living in Burra's cottage in Bucklebury Common. Burra was a book reviewer for The Spectator. In November 1936, Burra reviewed \\"The Agamemnon of Aeschylus\\" produced by Rupert Doone with music of Britten; the review appeared in the Group Theatre Paper. Personal life Peter Burra was friends with both Peter Pears and Benjamin Britten at different times. Pears lived with him at Bucklebury Common and Britten, while referring to him, used the word \\"Dear\\", which was \\"Britten's blanket term for his intimate friends\\"; he used the same word in regard to Peter Pears and Lennox Berkeley. Burra was killed on 27 April 1937, when a light aircraft flown by a friend crashed near Bucklebury Common, Berkshire. It was to have been Peter's first flying lesson. After visiting Spain, and a few days before the bombing of Guernica, he was hoping to help provide air-cover to Republicans. It was while sorting Burra's personal effects that the relationship between Pears and Britten started. Legacy Benjamin Britten wrote an unpublished song, \\"Not Even Summer Yet\\", for Peter Pears dedicated to Peter Burra. Pears sang it for the first time accompanied by Gordon Thorne during a concert to the memory of Burra. The song was later revived by tenor Neil Mackle accompanied at the piano by Iain Burnside, at Wigmore Hall, London, on 22 November 1983. Lennox Berkeley and Benjamin Britten dedicated the orchestral suite, Mont Juic (1937) \\"In memory of Peter Burra\\".

The hotel is in the Georgian style, in a building which was built in 1735, but was originally 17th century. For many years the house was in the possession of the descendants of William Marshall, the Earl of Pembroke. It later came under the ownership of the Varley family. In 1842, John Remington, vicar of Cartmel, built a fine dining room to entertain the Duke of Devonshire. Distinguishing features of the dining room include the panelling, bay windows and ornate moulded ceiling. It has 12 bedrooms, two of which are situated in a cottage, which was converted from a 16th-century stone stable. The hotel was awarded the Cesar Award by The Good Hotel Guide in 1998.

He is also the author of two books on RFID technology. He was the first person to attempt cycling the Seven Summits, and holds a world record for being the first person to officially cycle to Everest Base Camp and the first person to cycle Mount Elbrus. Early life and education Patrick J. Sweeney II was born in November 9, 1970 in Boston to first-generation Irish immigrants. His father worked three jobs while his mother took care of the children. In 1982 they settled in Keene. Sweeney enrolled in the University of New Hampshire where he took up rowing and was crew captain. He participated in two Olympic trials and finished 14th in 1992 and 2nd in 1996 in the single scull (one man rowing). (Google Books) He retired in 1996 after winning the Royal Canadian Henley Regatta in the \\"Men's Elite Single\\" category. (Google Books) In 1998, Sweeney earned an MBA from Darden Graduate School of Business Administration. Career Sweeney did an internship at Trammell Crow Company. In October 1999, he started a company, ServerVault, with $750,000 from angel investors, including the Dave Matthews Band. In 2000, the company opened data centers in the US and Ireland. In 2002 it was sold to Western & Southern Capital and later in 2009 to Carpathia Hosting. In 2002, Sweeney and the inventor of EPC protocol Daniel Engels started ODIN technologies. It became dominant in RFID technology. In January 2013 the company was acquired by Quake Global. Books Sweeney has authored three books: Fear is Fuel - the Surprising Power to Find Purpose, Passion and Performance which was ranked #5 on the Wall Street Journal Best Seller list for e-books for one week, the week of March 20th, 2020. He authored RFID for Dummies (2005) and CompTIA RFID+ Study Guide: Exam RF0-001 (2006). In 2012, Sweeney started DwinQ, a company that matched RFID technology with social media. On April 22, 2017 Sweeney gave a TEDx talk at Eaglebrook School (Deerfield, Massachusetts) named \\"The Surprising Power of Fear\\". Adventuring In November 2012, Sweeney and four other American tech entrepreneurs formed CoreCo/dwinQ team to compete in a three-day La Ruta de los Conquistadores race. In September 2013, Sweeney participated in Haute Route Pyrenees. DwinQ sponsored the event and provided RFID-based auto posting of racers' content to Facebook. In July 2014, Sweeney's nine-year-old son attempted to break the record for the youngest person to summit Mont Blanc. They hired British mountain guide Kenton Cool to lead the crew. On their trek toward the summit they were caught in a sliding snow avalanche and decided not to continue. Sweeney filmed the attempt and the video was shown on Good Morning America, leading to criticism for taking children on dangerous trips. Sweeney said he had no regrets and that the trip was \\"a heck of a lot better than having them sitting at home wasting their minds on Minecraft or TV or something like that\\". Sweeney was widely criticized for endangering his children. Jean-Marc Peillex, mayor of the Saint-Gervais municipality in France that includes Mont Blanc, Europe’s highest mountain, was furious when climbing enthusiast Paul Sweeney went on US TV to talk about his exploits. “It’s a demonstration of vanity and conceit pushed absolutely to the limit,” Peillex told reporters after seeing the lurid ABC news clip featuring Sweeny and his children, Shannon and Paul Junior.\\" Sweeney published video of his children almost being swept away on a steep snow-covered slope, saved by being roped into him. They can be heard screaming in terror as this happens. In February 2014, Sweeney participated in 350 miles in the Iditarod Trail Invitational race in Alaska on his fatbike. In 2015, Sweeney started an attempt to become the first person to summit the highest mountain on each continent and then ride down. On February 24, 2015 after a 6-day ride starting from Lukla, he reached South Base Camp in Nepal by bike, setting a world record. The record was questioned by other mountain bikers, but Sweeney argues that he is the first mountain biker to reach base camp on the \\"more difficult\\" Nepali side. In 2016, Sweeney teamed up with endurance mountain biker and adventure racer Rebecca Rusch to summit Mount Kilimanjaro and raise funds and awareness for World Bicycle Relief. The journey started on February 21 and lasted for six days. Sweeney and Rusch started their ascent at 6000 feet, went to the top both by foot and on a bike and rode bikes down to the bottom. During summer 2016, Sweeney climbed Mount Elbrus with his 11-year-old son. His son was not able to make it to the top, but Sweeney reached the summit becoming the first to bring a mountain bike to the top and descended to the base camp on a fatbike. Sweeney's son was overwhelmed with fatigue and Sweeney filmed him with frozen tears on is face. When observing his son's distress, Sweeney's reaction was to offer him more clothing and express concern at his body becoming cold. Sweeney then said it was up to his 11-year old son to decide whether or not to continue. Sweeney later said that his son's feet were becoming frostbitten. His son decided to go down. Sweeney's face conveyed extreme disappointment. Sweeney then abandoned his son with a guide and pushed on without him in order to achieve his personal goal of riding a bike down Mount Elbrus. In 2018 Sweeney won the Race Across America (RAAM) in the Mixed 4-Person under 50 Category riding a bicycle non-stop from Oceanside, Californian to Annapolis, Maryland.https://www.mensjournal.com/adventure/this-man-won-race-across- america-with-the-keto-diet-and-power-naps/https://gearjunkie.com/life-lessons- race-across-america  Books  * RFID for Dummies (2005) * CompTIA RFID+ Study Guide: Exam RF0-001 (2006) * Fear Is Fuel: The Surprising Power to Help You Find Purpose, Passion, and Performance (2020) References External links * Official website Travel broadcasters 1970 births Living people American people of Irish descent American investors 20th-century American businesspeople 21st-century American businesspeople University of Virginia Darden School of Business alumni University of New Hampshire alumni American technology chief executives American technology company founders Businesspeople from Boston Businesspeople in software American summiters of Mount Everest Downhill mountain bikers American mountain bikers ","title":"Patrick Sweeney (entrepreneur)"},{"id":"55344902","text":"Tim Scott (born January 25, 1993) is an American football safety who is currently a free agent.

Norton, 2001, pp. 30-31. (Google Books link) Tales of the augerino described it as a subterranean creature which inhabited the drier regions of Colorado. The augerino required a dry environment to survive and would bore holes in dams and irrigation ditches to let the water drain out. Some accounts described the augerino as a type of worm,Ernest W. Baughman, Type and Motif-Index of the Folktales of England and North America. Walter De Gruyter, 1966, p. 534. (Google Books link) though tales differ on the exact physical description of the creature. The name appears to derive from the diminutive of the common hand tool, the auger. A 1941 investigation of the folk tales of Middle Park, Colorado uncovered stories of the augerino describing it as a gigantic, corkscrew-shaped, indestructible wormlike creature which lined its burrows with a silica substance to keep them from collapsing.Ronald L. Ives, \\"Folklore of Eastern Middle Park, Colorado\\". Journal of American Folklore 54 (1941), pp. 24-43, at pp. 29-30. Some residents apparently believed the creature was authentic, remarking, \\"Hell, the ditches still leak, don't they?\\" Folklorist Ronald L. Ives suggested that genuine belief in the creature may have come from misinterpretations of paleontological finds; excavated laxispira specimens were sometimes known as \\"Devil's corkscrews\\" or \\"fossil augerinos\\". Ives had also published a fictional short story based on tales of the augerino in 1938.Ronald L. Ives, \\"The Augerino Oil Company\\". Coronet (Chicago), June 1938, pp. 53-57.

In 2012, he took over as head of Lionhead after Molyneux left, and in 2016, he founded a studio called Two Point Studios with Carr, which has signed a publishing deal with Sega.  Career  Webley began working with Molyneux in 1992. He was a programmer on Theme Park, and headed a department at Bullfrog responsible for porting games to other platforms. He later became a designer, programmer, and project leader of Theme Hospital. Although he was new to making original games, he picked the project from a list provided by Molyneux. For research, he and Carr visited hospitals such as the Royal Surrey County Hospital and Frimley Park Hospital. During a visit to Frimley Park, they were watching an operation when they made a fuss and distracted the surgeon, who called the pair \\"bloody idiots\\" and ordered them out. It was around this time when it was decided that the game should not be realistic, but Webley did not initially like the idea of using made up ailments. Webley improved an animation editor written by Molyneux and called it the Complex Engine. Webley held weekly meetings at a pub, in which he provided lists of tasks. It was realised that the game was complete during one such meeting, and it was released in 1997 to widespread critical acclaim: it sold four million copies, remained in the charts (it reached number one) for over a decade. According to Steve Jackson, Webley was \\"chuffed to bits\\" about Theme Hospitals success. The game also attracted some controversy: there was an article in The Daily Telegraph that said \\"Sick computer game used by British Medical Association to train senior management\\", NHS bosses complained about the game, and there was a mention in the Houses of Parliament. Webley appeared on some radio programmes to defend against these claims. After Theme Hospital, Webley co-founded Lionhead Studios with Molyneux, Jackson, and Tim Rance. Webley and Molyneux came up with the name, which the company shared with Webley's pet hamster. The hamster died shortly afterwards, and the studio was briefly renamed Red Eye Studios, but the name was shortly thereafter reverted to Lionhead. Around this time, Molyneux described Webley as \\"one of the best people in the industry\\". Webley worked on Black & White as a programmer and project manager, and also provided voices for the Missionary Song on the game's first island along with Russell Shaw. Before he became the project manager, he worked on the creature's artificial intelligence on a testbed version. On 3 May 2011, Webley was elected as a director to The Independent Game Developers' Association board. By this time, he was Lionhead's chief operating officer. In 2012, following Molyneux's departure from the company, Webley became head of Lionhead, He quit and was replaced by Scott Henson the following year. In 2016, Webley founded Two Point Studios with Carr. The following year, on 30 May, it was announced that the company had signed a publishing deal with Sega for a game revealed on 16 January 2018 to be Two Point Hospital, a spiritual successor to Theme Hospital. In 2011, Molyneux believed that Webley was worthy of Game Developers Choice Awards' Lifetime Achievement honour.  Personal life  As of July 1997, Webley is Peter Molyneux's brother-in-law.

Engelhard Cromwell (November 19, 1906 – September 14, 1986) was an American mountaineer in the Canadian Rockies and the Selkirk and Purcell ranges. She was the first female climber to ascend many of the peaks in the Rockies and was the leading female amateur climber of her day. She was also an accomplished painter and photographer. Early life Engelhard was born in Manhattan on November 19, 1906, the first child of George Engelhard, a lawyer, and Agnes Stieglitz. She was a niece of Alfred Stieglitz, an American photographer and modern art promoter, and his wife, Georgia O'Keeffe, an American artist considered by many to be the \\"Mother of American modernism\\". To avoid confusion of names between the two \\"Georgias\\", Engelhard was usually referred to as \\"the Kid\\" or \\"Georgia Minor\\". She occasionally posed for photographs by Stieglitz. Engelhard took up art at an early age and showed considerable talent.Early (undated) color pencil drawing by Georgia Engelhard; Alfred Stieglitz/Georgia O'Keeffe archive, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University Library Stieglitz sponsored a month-long exhibition of her water colors and drawings at his famous gallery, 291, in 1916, when she was just 10 years old.Sarah Greenough, Modern Art and America: Alfred Stieglitz and His New York Galleries (Washington: National Gallery of Art, 2000), pp. 546-47 Engelhard studied art at Vassar College, graduating with a BA in 1927. \\"The Vassar Connection: Paul Rosenfeld, Edna Bryner Schwab, and Alfred Stieglitz NOTES,\\" Vassar Quarterly, Volume LXXXIV, Number 2, 1 March 1988 Later in life, she abandoned painting and turned to photography. In her early 20s, she won prizes for her equestrian skills at the National Horse Show in New York. Mountain climbing Engelhard had visited the European Alps in her teens. In 1926, she climbed in the Mount Rainier area with her father. That same year, her family visited the Canadian Rockies, where she climbed Pinnacle Mountain with Edward Feuz, Jr. assisting as her guide. Obituary of Edward Feuz Jr., 1884-1981, American Alpine Journal She returned to the Rockies for 15 summers during the next 25 years. In 1929, Engelhard climbed nine peaks in the Canadian Rockies: Mount Lefroy, the traverse of the two Pope's Peaks, the traverse of Haddo Peak and Mount Aberdeen, Mount Hungabee, Mount Huber, Mount Victoria, and Mount Biddle. In 1931, she climbed a total of 38 peaks in the Canadian Rockies, Selkirks, and Purcells. She reached the summit of Mount Victoria eight times that summer, with seven of the trips made as a part of the filming of the movie She Climbs to Conquer (1932), Canadian Educational, Sponsored and Industrial Film Project which was directed by William J. Oliver, the famed Calgary-based film maker. \\"Calgary photographer and motorcycle enthusiast William J. Oliver had an eye for his times,\\" by Michael Platt, Calgary Sun, January 07, 2017 The film was sponsored by Parks Canada, the parks branch of the Canadian national government, and was instrumental in drawing increased tourism to the Canadian Rockies.Manufacturing National Park Nature: Photography, Ecology, and the Wilderness Industry of Jasper, J. Keri Cronin, UBC Press, 2011, pp. 83-84. Engelhard appears in the film as an unnamed female climbing along with her guide Edward Feuz. Engelhard completed 32 first ascents in the Rockies and Selkirks. She climbed several of the US Rocky Mountains in Colorado and most of the Cascade Volcanoes. In 1935 she climbed the European Alps for the first time, joining Oliver Eaton (Tony) Cromwell, Jr., who became a member of the 1939 failed German-American expedition up the Pakistani peak of K2.K2: the 1939 Tragedy, Andrew Kauffman and William Putnam, Mountaineers Books, 1993. Cromwell was a veteran mountaineer and he and Engelhard married in 1947 after the two had climbed together for several years, mostly in the Canadian Rockies. The marriage was Cromwell's third and Engelhard's first. The couple later moved to Switzerland. Engelhard never returned to the Canadian Rockies after 1946. Engelhard considered the best compliment of her climbing skill to be that offered by her guide Feuz after she and Cromwell had climbed Victoria, Collier, and Pope's Peak Traverse. Feuz said in his heavy Swiss accent: \\"Dat Chorcha, she vants to do too much.\\" He added that Engelhard \\"climbed so fast she often had us guides puffing to keep up.\\" Engelhard was one of the first women to wear pants as opposed to the customary ankle-length skirt when climbing, as was dictated by Victorian female fashion conventions of the early 20th century. \\"The Sisterhood of the Mountaineering Pants,\\" August 8, 2011, by Erinn Morgan Painting and photography Her aunt Georgia O' Keefe mentored Engelhard as a painter. The two artists frequently painted together at O'Keefe and Stieglitz's summer house on Lake George and occasionally took excursions together, sometimes walking without clothes for miles through the dense forests.C. S. Merrill, Weekends with O'Keeffe, University of New Mexico Press, 2013, entry for September 29, 1974. Engelhard's paintings reflected O' Keefe's influence. Their two styles, in fact, became so similar that late in life O'Keefe received a letter from an art collector, enclosing a photo of a painting, asking if the particular painting had, in fact, been painted by O'Keefe. O'Keefe was not sure and wrote to Engelhard in Switzerland enclosing the photograph of the painting. Engelhard replied that it was she, in fact, who had done the painting. In 1938, when Engelhard began living with Cromwell, she stopped painting and together the couple pursued photography. Their photographs were mainly ordinary scenes of the Swiss Alps and alpine villages. Many of the photographs were sold to postcard companies or used in promotional tourism advertising.

Professional career Margarita Landi was one of the first women to specialize in the journalistic genre of crime reporting, which had traditionally been limited to men. Her diploma in criminology helped her to excel in this field. Widowed at age 28, her career began shortly thereafter. Following the Spanish Civil War, Landi worked in the magazine of Sección Femenina, El Ventanal, between 1947 and 1948. From there she went to La Moda de España (1948–1954), as a chronicler of haute couture and society, also contributing to the newspaper ' and the magazine Esfera Mundial. In 1955 she joined the newspaper ', which had been founded three years earlier by , where she remained for 25 years. It was from that moment that she began to cultivate the image for which she was known: a sophisticated and reflective blonde woman who smoked a pipe and raced to crime scenes in a black Volkswagen convertible. She enjoyed excellent relations with the police, which allowed her access to detailed information on cases which were the most shocking to the public. She was sometimes referred to as \\"sub-inspector Pedrito\\" to disguise her involvement in official investigations. She was also known as la rubia del deportivo (the sports blonde) and la dama del crimen (the crime lady). Her tenacity in examining crime scenes and interviewing witnesses was compared to that of American writer Truman Capote. After the disappearance of El Caso, Landi began to write for the magazine Interviú in November 1980, and in 1988 she made the leap to television, with sporadic appearances on Televisión Española programs such as ' (1991), ' (1993–1994), and ' (2000–2002). She also directed and presented her own program on Telemadrid, Mis crímenes favoritos (1992). She wrote several books, including Cosas de la vida, Una mujer junto al crimen, Crímenes sin castigo, Puerta del Sol, 2.30, Crónica sangrienta, and Memorias. 35 años de crimen en España. Margarita Landi retired from journalism in 2002. Personal life Born Encarnación Margarita Isabel Verdugo Díez, she adopted the surname Landi in reference to her ancestor, journalist Verdugo Landi. She had three children, two of whom died at a young age. In her later years she lived with her surviving son, Ángel Torres. Margarita Landi died in Albandi on 6 February 2004 at age 85. She had experienced complications after an operation for osteoarthritis in 2002, and never fully recovered.

The film premiered at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival and was theatrically released on July 27, 2018. Reception On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 86% based on 72 reviews, with an average rating of 6.91/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"Scotty and the Secret History of Hollywood offers plenty of prurient thrills for film fans, but beyond the gossip lies a poignantly illuminating look at decades of sexual mores.\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a normalized score of 67 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". In his review for The Hollywood Reporter, Todd McCarthy commented: \\"What could have been a merely sensationalistic exposé of the private lives of then-closeted screen luminaries instead emerges, in the hands of documentarian Matt Tyrnauer as a nicely filled-out look at different eras, one secrecy-ridden and dedicated to the preservation of illusion, the other wide open and blasé about personal predilections.\\"  Film adaptation  In July 2020, it was announced Searchlight Pictures had acquired the rights to the documentary and was developing a feature film based on Bowers' life.

It is known for its elaborate Byzantine revival church and for the building's elaborately decorated interior, featuring traditional Byzantine- style wall painting. History The present building was dedicated in 1952 by Archbishop Michael of America; the church's previous building was demolished and the congregation worshiped in the nearby Ft. George Presbyterian Church during construction. In the mid-20th century, the neighborhood was home to large numbers of Greek immigrants. By the end of the century, the population of the neighborhood had changed, the congregation was dwindling, and the church was failing financially. The parish also operated the adjacent St. Spyridon School, which was similarly failing for lack of funds by the end of the century. Following the destruction of St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church in the collapse of the south tower of the World Trade Center in the 2001 September 11 attacks, parishioners of St. Nicholas worshiped at St. Spyridon. Architecture The church's Byzantine Revival building was dedicated in 1952. The modern facade features Byzantine-Romanesque tiered arches. The interior is noted for the elaborate, traditional iconography that covers the walls and ceilings, much of it was created when the church was built by Georgios Gliatas, a student of iconographer Fotis Kontoglou. Some of the church's elaborate Byzantine-style woodwork was carved in the 1970s by Konstantinos Pylarinos.

She is known for her role as the Cape Town African National Congress Women's League President, a leader in the 1956 anti-pass Women's March to the Union Buildings in Pretoria, South Africa and the only African woman in the 1956 treason trial in South Africa. Personal life Annie Silinga was born in 1910 at Nqqamakwe in the Butterworth district of the Transkei, now known as the Eastern Cape, where she only completed a few years of primary school. Silinga grew up in Transkei during a time of prosperity, when the land allowed farming and cattle could graze freely. However, over population led to soil erosion and overgrazing causing poverty in the area. By 1937, conditions had deteriorated to the point where Silinga was desperate to move. Her \\"babies,\\" she said, \\"had been dying in the Transkei.\\" In 1937, when she was 27, Silinga moved to Cape Town where her husband Matthew had just gained employment, hoping for better medical facilities. In Cape Town, for the first time, Silinga, her husband and their five children could live together as a family. At his previous job in the mines of Johannesburg, accommodation was not provided for the families of the mineworkers and regulations forbade women from staying there for extended periods. After World War II, Silinga and her husband moved to Langa township. Although Silinga was arrested numerous times, she and her family remained in Langa where she died in 1984. Political work After moving to Langa, after World War II, Silinga began attending meetings at which measures to improve conditions for the community were discussed. In 1948, aged 38, she joined the Langa Vigilance Association (LVA). LVA sought to fight for the improvement of living conditions in Langa and protect the residents from apartheid laws. In 1952, she joined the ANC, she joined the African National Congress (ANC). Soon after joining the ANC, she took part in the anti-pass laws in the movement's 1952 Defiance Campaign where she was arrested and served a brief jail term for civil disobedience. She served the jail sentence with her six month old baby. In 1953, Silinga, then a member of the ANC Women's League (ANCWL), was part of the core group that organised the first meeting of the Federation of South African Women (FSAW), to harness the outrage of women against the pass law issue. The group was led by Ray Alexander, communist and trade unionist, and included Gladys Smith of the Cape Housewives' League, Katie White of the Women's Food Committee, and Dora Tamanda of the ANCWL and the Communist Party of South Africa. At the first conference, held in Johannesburg in April 1954, Silinga was elected as part of the FEDSAW National Executive Committee It was also at this meeting that the Women’s Charter was written by women from different races. In 1954, during a FEDSAW meeting at the Cape Town Parade, Silinga declared: “I will never carry a pass, I will only carry one similar to Mrs (Susan) Strijdom’s. She is a woman and I am too. There is no difference.” After breaking the pass law and a few unsuccessful appeals, she was banished to Transkei in 1956. She returned illegally to be with her children and husband in Langa. In 1957, Silinga appealed her case successfully on the grounds that more than 15 years’ residence in Cape Town entitled her to remain there. On 9 August 1956, Silinga led 20 000 women organised by FEDSAW who marched to the prime minister's office in Pretoria to protest the issuing of passes. Silinga was arrested alongside other FEDSAW leaders Lilian Ngoyi and Helen Joseph, as well as ANC leaders Oliver Tambo and Nelson Mandela. The apartheid government charged Silinga and other activists with treason. The initial phase of the Treason Trial lasted until December 1957, when the state dropped charges against 61 of the defendants. Silinga was one of those released. In 1958, Silinga was elected as the president of the Cape Town ANCWL in 1958. In 1960 anti-pass law riots happened in Langa and Sharpeville. The apartheid government declared a state of emergency and Silinga was one of the people arrested. The ANC was banned as a political organisation in 1960. Upon her return from prison, she was involved in the formation of the Women’s Front, and was made a patron of the United Democratic Front in 1983. Silinga lived in Langa all her life and died without having carried a pass in 1984. Although she was buried in an unmarked pauper's grave, artist Sue Williamson, at the request of Annie Silinga’s family, created a piece to place at her grave in Langa cemetery. It bears Silinga's battle cry: \\"I will never carry a pass!\\" Legacy Silinga is remembered as one of the leaders in the anti-pass campaign during apartheid South Africa. Besides political work, Silinga is remembered for her selfless character, having started a creche along Winnie Seqwana in Langa Township. A street in Phillipi, Cape Town is named after Annie Silinga.

While some regretted the loss of old rivalries, the conference made an effort to establish crossover games between teams that had traditions under which they had played each other regularly in the past.Anastasia, Phil. \\"West Jersey Football League realigned South Jersey teams\\", The Philadelphia Inquirer, August 31, 2016. \\"'I remember when we [Overbrook] were in the Olympic Conference, then we were in the Tri- County Conference, then the Colonial,\\" said Wilczynski, whose team will see nontraditional foes such as Woodstown, Oakcrest, and Holy Cross in crossover games while maintaining its Thanksgiving rivalry with Lindenwold.\\" With a decline in the number of student athletes playing football at West Windsor- Plainsboro High School North that would be inadequate for the school to field a team of its own, the West Windsor-Plainsboro Regional School District attempted to combine the teams from the two schools to have them operate as a single co-operative football team for the 2017-18 school year based at West Windsor-Plainsboro High School South. Given that the size of the schools is larger than the threshold established by the state for co-op programs (North is classified as Group III and South as Group IV, based on the size of the enrollment of each school), the proposal was rejected in a 76-16 vote by the West Jersey Football League and by the Leagues and Conferences Committee of the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association, before an appeal of the decision was rejected by the Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Education.Miller, Sean. \\"State denies West Windsor-Plainsboro's appeal in football merger\\", The Times (Trenton), July 12, 2017.

But the NJSIAA denied the action, because North is classified as a Group 3 school and South as a Group 4.\\" In August 2017, the district announced that WW-P North would cancel its program.

Released worldwide on September 22, 2017 by the label Gain (working with Sony Music) and produced by Tobias Lindell, it was recorded after a multi-year hiatus for the group. The album has received praise from publications such as Louder and MelodicRock.com among others. Background and production details The group's last album was 2014's Tearing Down the Walls. According to a press release, the band decided to record Into the Great Unknown in Bangkok, Thailand, having already come up with ten possible songs to use, and used the facilities of Karma Sound Studios. The release also stated that H.e.a.t took inspiration at the modern resurgence in public attention, particularly among young adults, of older artists considered \\"classic rock heroes\\" such as Foreigner, Journey, and Whitesnake. It is the band's second release without a founding guitarist, in this case Eric Rivers. In August 2017, the group released the track \\"Redefined\\" along with a music video depicting footage of H.E.A.T in the studio. Reviews Writing for Louder, music critic Dom Lawson praised the release for featuring a \\"thrilling formula that made the Swedes’ previous albums such a goofy delight.\\" He remarked that the \\"effervescent presence and towering voice of frontman Erik Grönwall make everything from... sound vital and timely without sacrificing any of that mid-80s sheen.\\" Lawson concluded, \\"The best way to get drawn into H.E.A.T’s world of singalong euphoria is to catch them live, but this album will provide more than enough dizzying, life-affirming joy in the meantime.\\" MelodicRock.com also published a supportive review. The publication highlighted the change of pace in some tracks, noting the inclusion of emotional ballads and how multiple songs feature prominent keyboard playing.

Early in the country's history, human rights issues for people with disabilities took second place to the need to secure independence and building the economy. Singapore signed on to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) in 2013 and coordinates the Enabling Masterplan with both government and non governmental organisations.  History  A discourse of charity generally permeated in Singapore since the post world war 2 period. Support for disabled people was left to the community, who set up various voluntary organisations. The end of the war saw the British implement the welfare state based on the Beveridge Report, which had repercussions in Singapore. As part of this focus on welfare, a Social Welfare Department (SWD) was set up in 1946. SWD was meant to provide permanent assistance only for those with a permanent disability or because of old age. However, the SWD was not as comprehensive as the British system. The SWD also did not provide provisions for special education and in fact, seemed to have the idea that children with special needs would \\"hinder the typical child's education.\\" The 1960s and 1970s, with Singapore's emphasis on economic growth, saw a new priority on rehabilitating disabled people so as to enable them to join and return to the work force. It was only in 1981, when the first world congress of Disabled People's International was held in Singapore that began a new discourse based on the social model of disability. Disabled activists from around the world, including Vic Finkelstein, Ed Roberts (activist) and Bengt Lindqvist, elected a Singaporean, Ron Chandran Dudley as the first founder chairperson. This was to lead to a growth in disability activism from the 1980s onwards. In 1983, the Ministry of Social Affairs held a workshop on people with disabilities and came up with a formal policy about how to advocate for people with disabilities. The workshop came up with the first nationally endorsed definition of disability that recognized their needs in society. The Advisory Council on the Disabled was formed in April 1988 and was first chaired by Tony Tan. The council emphasized the importance of integrating disabled people as equal citizens. Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong included disabled people on the Remaking Singapore campaign in 2002. Also in 2002, the government created a voluntary, affordable form of health insurance called ElderShield. The insurance helps pay for expenses in the care of severely disabled people. In 2013, Singapore signed onto the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).  Demographics  For individuals over 50, around 13.3% are considered disabled; between ages 18 and 49, around 3.4% are disabled and 2.1% of children under 18 are disabled in Singapore. Of those who have a disability, around half are considered physical or sensory disabilities. One in 68 children in Singapore has been diagnosed with autism. The number of children diagnosed with autism has increased in Singapore over time. Around 5 to 6 percent of children born in Singapore have developmental problems of various types. Only 0.55% of the Singapore workforce has a disability of some kind.  Causes  Around half of people with physical disabilities acquired them through congenital or hereditary means.  Cultural attitudes towards disability  In Singapore, there has been an emphasis on rehabilitating those with disabilities. People who were unable to work have often been seen through a utilitarian lens, since they were deemed as unable to contribute economically to the country. In addition, the prevention of disabilities was seen as important. In 1970, Singapore passed the Voluntary Sterilisation Act (VSA) which allowed any spouse, parent or legal guardian of a person with recurring or permanent mental or physical disabilities to consent to sterilization on their behalf. This gave caregivers of people with disabilities \\"inordinate power to make decisions on their behalf.\\" During the 1980s and 90s, many disabled people were kept at home or put into institutions. People who have disabilities that are less obvious face social judgement and stigma for their disability. They are often questioned whether they need assistance because they don't \\"look\\" disabled. A 2015 study conducted by the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) found that a third of people in Singapore would not employ individuals with disabilities. Many Singaporeans are unsure how to interact with people with disabilities because the etiquette in such situations was unclear. Sport Since the founding of the Singapore Disability Sports Council (then named the \\"Singapore Sports Council for the Handicapped\\") in 1973, Singaporean disabled athletes started participation in regional and Commonwealth disability sport events. Singapore entered a team in Paralympic Games for the first time at the 1988 Summer Paralympics, and have participated in every Summer Games since.  Policy  Singapore, in comparison to other similar countries, does not spend a lot of money on social welfare services. The government emphasizes the ideas of self-reliance with the family being the first line of a person's support and volunteer and grassroots organizations helping next. Because family is the \\"first line of support,\\" people with disabilities who rely on caregivers are \\"often at the mercy of the vagaries of family relationships.\\" Modern views on working with people who have disabilities in Singapore have evolved over time. Nevertheless, the government does not have a \\"clear definition of disability and persons with disability.\\" The Enabling Masterplan 2012-2016 recommended promoting inclusiveness for people with disabilities through educational campaigns. Several campaigns took place in 2013, some promoted by the government and others by NGOs. In 2016, a campaign to raise Singaporean's awareness of people with disabilities was unveiled. The five-year campaign was created by NCSS and is called \\"See the True Me.\\" In 2017, the government of Singapore allocated $400 million on people with disabilities. A school-to-work transition program for students who have developmental and intellectual disabilities was created in 2017. Individuals with a developmental disability are able to use a Developmental Disability Registry Identity Card (DDR ID Card) which provides discounts and access to participating facilities. In addition, people with developmental disabilities are aided in police investigations by the Appropriate Adult Scheme (AAS) of 2015.  Infrastructure  Wheelchair bus ramp. All train stations in Singapore are equipped with accessible entrances and elevators. Stations also have braille information and tactile surface indicators. Train station names are announced for the visually impaired and red lights flash to warn of door closings for the deaf. The Enabling Masterplan 2012-2016 also provided Singapore with accessible signage for public transportation and in public areas and buildings. Accessible parking is available for individuals with physical disabilities. Housing structures provided by the Housing Development Board (HDB) are free of barriers and since 2006, older housing estates have been upgraded with ramps, handrails and provide other types of assistance to people with disabilities. The public environment since has been improved through the Code on Accessibility in the Built Environment 2013, which provides greater accessibility in buildings and infrastructure constructed after 2013. Companies are provided support through the government to upgrade existing facilities in order to provide \\"basic accessibility features.\\"  Education  Chin Pu (or \\"Progress\\") centers were set up by the Singapore Association for Retarded Children (SARC), which is now known as the Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore (MINDS). These centers or schools were first sponsored by the Rotary Club of Singapore in 1961. However, children with multiple disabilities and who had disabilities other than intellectual disabilities did not qualify for the Chin Pu centers. For many years, children with various special needs were not accepted by schools in Singapore. One of the first schools for children with disabilities was opened on March 12, 1979 by Leaena Tambyah. The school was called AWWA's Handicapped Children's Playgroup and operated out of St Ignatius Church. Since around 2011, the government of Singapore has created early childhood intervention services which include therapy and educational support. The Ministry of Education (MOE) created the Special Education Needs Fund in 2014 to help students with disabilities buy assistive technology devices for school. In 2017, the government called for further integration of disabled children into schools. Projects such as Children in Action and Buddy'IN allowed children from both with and without special needs to interact in meaningful ways for both groups. New recommendations for special education also include placing a greater emphasis on life skills necessary for employment and living independently. The first inclusive preschool, Kindle Garden, was started in 2016 by the Asian Women's Welfare Association (AWWA). Higher education institutions, such as Singapore Management University (SMU), don't always provide accommodations for students with disabilities on hand. In the case of SMU, when students were seen needing accommodations, the university created a committee with Jack Yong Ho as the head to procure items for inclusion.  Non Governmental Organisations  Activist, Ron Chandran- Dudley, who was also visually impaired, played an important part in the 1980s by representing Singapore at the first Disabled People's International (DPI) World Congress. Chandran-Dudley pointed out that many people who are disabled in Singapore were not in leadership positions in the organizations developed for them. He also advocated that it was important to focus on what disabled people could do, not what they couldn't do. In April 1986, the Singapore chapter of DPI, called the Disabled People's Association (DPA), was registered, becoming the first advocacy group for the rights of people with disabilities to be officially recognized. DPA continues to advocate for the rights of people with disabilities. DPA promotes cultural understanding for people with disabilities by visiting places such as schools and offices. An organization for children with intellectual disabilities, Singapore Association for Retarded Children (SARC), which later changed its name to Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore, (MINDS) was started in 1962 by medical social worker, Daisy Vaithliningam.  Legislation  Legislation that supported and protect the rights of people with disabilities in Singapore started in the 1980s. There is no law against denying service or access to people with disabilities in Singapore. The VSA, which allows individuals to be sterilized was amended in 2012 to give greater consent to people who may undergo the process. Singapore is a state party to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, having signed on 30 November 2012 and ratified on 18 July 2013.

South Korea’s 1980s was a time when university students were on the frontlines of political activism, which later contributed to the growth of various civil movements. To categorize the political lines of liberal university students of the 1980s, There was the PD (People Democracy), which focused on labor movements based on Marxist ideologies, and the NL (National Liberty), which thought the most important thing was reunification based on their studies of North Korea’s Juche ideology. Jeon Sungtae is a writer who thinks that the contradiction of South Korean society arises from the special nature of being a divided nation. Therefore, the various characters in Jeon Sungtae’s fiction agonize over the tragic situation of war and division between North and South Korea, while at the same time also suffering from the oppressive reality that such conditions give rise to.  Life  Jeon Sungtae was born in 1969 in Goheung County, Jeollanam-do Province, South Korea. His birthplace was a countryside town in Goheung, Jeollanamdo consisting of 20 households. Having grown up here, his memories from his youth became a very important foundation in forming his literary mindset that is slightly antiquated and humorous. Jeon Sungtae has said that \\"at the time of my literary debut, the popular trends were of the X generation, and the Orange Tribe. Writers of my age were writing about cultural experiences like the Sampoong Department Store and Seo Taiji. So I had a complex about the fact that I wrote stories about country boys who dig holes for fun and catch frogs to sell. I felt a bit intimidated among all these writers armed with urban sensibilities, like a lone grain of black rice among all the white rice.\\" Later, Jeon Sungtae studied creative writing at Chung-Ang University, and began his literary career when he was awarded the Silcheon Munhak New Writer’s Award in 1994. His published works include the short story collections Dubeonui jahwasang (두번의 자화상 The Second Self-Portrait), Wolves (늑대), Kukkyeongeul neomneun il (국경을 넘는 일 Over The Border), and Maehyang (매향 Burying Incense); the novel Yeoja ibalsa (여자 이발사 The Female Barber); and the book of essays Sungtae, Mangtae, Buri Bungtae (성태 망태 부리 붕태). He has also written a book of reportage Gileseo mannan sesang (길에서 만난 세상 The World I Met On the Road), and children’s books Gutenbereukeu (구텐베르크 Gutenberg) and Janghwahongryeonjeon (장화홍련전 The Story of Janghwa and Hongryeon). Later he won the Sin Dong-yup Prize for Literature, the Mu-young Literature Prize, the Chae Man-sik Literary Award, the Oh Yeongsu Literary Award, the Hyundae Literary Award, the Lee Hyo-seok Literary Award, and the Hankook Ilbo Literary Award.  Writing  When evaluating Jeon Sungtae, what is commonly discussed is that he is a rich storyteller who has inherited the narrative tradition of Korea. That is why he is considered as a writer who joins the line of authors Kim Yujung, Chae Man-sik, Lee Mun Ku, and Hwang Sok-yong. However, aside from his appeal as a talented storyteller, another strength of his that is important is his ability to tell a story about social issues at personal levels in detail. Jeon Sungtae, who debuted in 1994 with winning the Silcheon Munhak New Writer’s Award, he has described his interests for fiction as following: \\"When I was in university, I did creative work in groups, and started writing for the idea that this was something I’d do for the rest of my life. When I had just turned 30, I was also the secretary general of the Association of Writers for National Literature. But when socialism failed, I began to question about ‘whether our problems of desire are going to be resolved if we achieve a society that we want’. And after that my writing became more flexible\\". Roughly explained, Jeon Sungtae’s first and second collections, Maehyang (매향 Burying Incense), and Kukkyeongeul neomneun il (국경을 넘는 일 Over The Border) were stories that he formed from doubts and questions regarding the process of practicing social activism. However, after his third collection Wolves (늑대), it can be said that his subject matter was expanded to the problem of desire coming from capitalism. His colleague Paik Gahuim said of Jeon Sungtae: \\"Jeon Sungtae is an unprolific writer. He has written fiction in a very careful way, and the fiction he has written has become established very preciously. His wits carried out in real situations have given pride to the aesthetic superiority of our literature. Especially in the 1990s, when the direction of fiction was heading toward individual stories of members of society, he was diving more deeply into our society and reality. This is why it is natural that his works occupy an important role in our literary history. Because realism isn’t something that changes with the changes of time. Considering that fiction is a very trivial thing that could only be played out in the streets of ordinary people in the real world, that it is a genre that can only have a voice through the sight of that reality, his fiction was a great thing.\\"  Works   Short Story Collections  * Dubeonui jahwasang (두번의 자화상 The Second Self-Portrait), Changbi, 2015.

Common symptoms include moderate to severe intellectual disability and developmental delay. Characteristic abnormalities include cerebral cortex malformations, vision difficulties, musculoskeletal abnormalities and congenital defects. Individuals with a mutation in the SON gene may not all display these features. However, SON loss of function (LoF) variants appear to cause a clinically distinguished phenotype.  Signs and Symptoms  The key signs and symptoms associated with ZTTK Syndrome patients include ocular, facial and systemic features.  Ocular Features  Distinctive ocular features of the ZTTK syndrome are deep- set eyes, down-slanting palpebral fissures and horizontal eyebrows. Children with ZTTK syndrome may present with vision problems including optic atrophy and cerebral visual impairment, resulting in poor visual responses. Strabismus; misalignment or crossing of the eyes when viewing an object, direct hypermetropia; farsightedness, and nystagmus; eyes making repetitive and uncontrolled movements, are frequently present.  Facial Features  Individuals with ZTTK syndrome have distinctive minor to moderate facial dysmorphisms. Distinct facial features include facial asymmetry, low-set ears, midface retraction, frontal bossing, a depressed and or broad nasal bridge and a smooth or short philtrum.  Systemic Features  Multi-system abnormalities are common in ZTTK syndrome. The majority of individuals diagnosed with ZTTK syndrome display congenital malformations such as urogenital and malformations, heart defects, and a high or cleft palate. Congenital defects such as a thinned atrial septum, ventricular septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus, dysplastic kidney and agenesis of the lung and gallbladder have also been noted. Whole body musculoskeletal abnormalities have been observed in ZTTK syndrome patients, including hemivertebrae, scoliosis or kyphosis, contractures, joint laxity, joint hypermobility and hypotonia. During the neonatal period, persistent feeding difficulties is associated with growth failure and a short stature in most individuals with ZTTK syndrome.  Central Nervous System  Developmental delay is common in ZTTK syndrome patients, and appears to progressively increase the severity of intellectual disability with age. The development of gross and fine motor skills, as well as fluent and receptive language skills are shown to be delayed in developmental age. Macrocephaly and brain white matter abnormalities have also been observed. Seizures often develop between the ages of 1 to 6 years old.  Physiological  Mutations of the SON gene can affect metabolism and mitochondrial function in newborns with ZTTK syndrome. Metabolic screening confirmed mitochondrial dysfunction and O-glycosylation defects in individuals with ZTTK syndrome. Decreased levels of immunoglobulin A and or immunoglobulin G identified in ZTTK syndrome patients resulted in coagulation abnormalities.  Genetics  ZTTK syndrome is caused by heterozygous mutations in the SON gene. As an autosomal dominant disease, children with parents carrying a SON mutation have a 50% risk of inheriting the mutation. However, the majority of affected individuals have de novo mutations in the SON gene and ZTTK syndrome is not inherited to their children.  Allelic Variants of SON Gene  Many individuals with ZTTK syndrome have identified heterozygosity for a de novo 4-base pair deletion, de novo mutation in exon 3 in the SON gene and de novo 2-base point insertion in exon, resulting in haploinsufficiency or a frameshift and premature termination in the arginine/serine (RS) domain. Peripheral blood cells from the sampled patients confirmed decreased levels of the mutant RNA transcript, consistent with haploinsufficiency. Other mutations observed include a nonsense mutation, an in-frame deletion of amino acids and an entire gene deletion. De novo heterozygous 1-base point duplication in exon 3 and 1-base point deletion in exon 4 of the SON gene resulted in a frameshift and premature termination. Parental DNA has confirmed that de novo mutations are common in patients with ZTTK syndrome. De novo LoF mutations and haploinsufficiency for the SON gene are shown to cause profound developmental malformations during embryonic development as seen in the phenotypic manifestations of the ZTTK syndrome.  Structure of SON Gene  SON is a large protein consisting of 2426 amino acids and repeat sequences. SON is located within the human chromosomal region 21q22.11 in nuclear speckles and consists of 12 exons. Exon 3 of the SON gene is particularly large, accounting for 82% of the entire coding region. The majority of SON variants found in ZTTK syndrome individuals are localised to exon 3.  Mechanism  Role of the spliceosome-associated gene, SON in regulating RNA splicing through intron retention and exon skipping to maintain the pluripotency of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and cell-cycle progression.  Role of SON in RNA Splicing  The SON gene encodes the SON protein, which is able to bind to DNA and RNA. The SON protein is mainly localised to nuclear speckles and involved in a variety of cellular processes such as transcription, cell cycle regulation and subnuclear organisation of pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing. SON contains various domains such as the RS-rich domain, a G-patch domain and a double- stranded RNA-binding motif. The presence of these domains is necessary for SON to mediate constitutive and alternative splicing. The RS-rich domain serves to localise SON in nuclear speckles with pre-mRNA processing factors. The functional domains and specific localisation of SON in nuclear speckles has indicated its role in pre-mRNA splicing. SON also plays a key role in alternative splicing of exons. SON is required for genome stability by ensuring the efficiency of RNA splicing of weak constitutive and alternative splice sites. SON-dependent cell-cycle genes possess a weak 5’ or 3’ splice site and are dependent on SON to ensure efficient splicing and spliceosome recognition.  Role of SON in Embryonic Development  The SON gene also plays a critical role during development. SON is expressed preferentially in undifferentiated stem cells. Depletion of SON results in stem cell differentiation. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are able to undergo lineage-specific differentiation into specific types of cells, known as pluripotency. Pluripotent stem cells, such as hESCs can undergo gastrulation to give rise to the three germ layers. A significant level of SON expression in fetal tissue has suggested a regulatory role of SON in cellular proliferation and or differentiation during embryonic development by influencing the splicing of pluripotency maintenance genes. The expression of transcription factors such as the SON factor and epigenetic modifiers regulate the pluripotency of hESCs by ensuring genes undergo RNA splicing to create a mature RNA transcript. The SON gene is required for RNA splicing of transcripts encoding the cell-cycle protein TUBG1 and genes maintaining hESC pluripotency; PRDM14, OCTA, E4F1 and MED24 in hESCs. As OCT4 is involved in the core transcriptional circuitry in hESCs, misregulation of OCT4 induces cell differentiation. PRDM14 is a pluripotency regulator and MED24 is a mediator complex essential in the maintenance of pluripotency. In wild-type ESCs, SON binding to the RNA transcripts of pluripotency regulating genes such as PRDM14 and OCT4 results in correct splicing and maintenance of pluripotency.  Effects of SON Haploinsufficiency on RNA Splicing and Embryonic Development  The downregulation of SON can impact the regulation of mitotic regulator transcripts and cause defects in cell survival and the developmental process. SON depletion causes decreased cell growth, disarrayed microtubule processes and disordered spindle pole separation, causing mitotic arrest at metaphase and severe genome integrity impairment. Mitotic cells without functional SON have increased double-stranded DNA breaks and micronuclei formation. Consequently, genome stability and regulation of the cell cycle are compromised, contributing to the development of multi-organ defects in ZTTK syndrome patients. Aberrant splicing and de novo heterozygous LoF mutations in SON gene disrupts the process of gene expression and can result in SON haploinsufficiency. ZTTK syndrome individuals with SON haploinsufficiency display decreased mRNA expression and abnormal RNA splicing products of numerous genes which are necessary for neuronal cell migration, metabolic processes and neurodevelopment of the brain. RNA analyses from affected individuals with ZTTK syndrome confirmed the downregulation of genes essential for neuronal migration and cortex organisation (TUBG1, FLNA, PNKP, WDR62, PSMD3, HDAC6) and metabolism (PCK2, PFKL, IDH2, ACY1, and ADA). Aberrant SON-mediated RNA splicing results from the accumulation of mis- spliced transcripts. The mis-spliced RNA products are caused by significant intron retention (TUBG1, FLNA, PNKP, WDR62, PSMD3, PCK2, PFKL, IDH2, and ACY1) and exon skipping (HDAC6 and ADA). In contrast, the parents of individuals with ZTTK syndrome display an absence of mis-spliced RNA products. SON depletion downregulates and causes aberrant splicing of the pluripotency factors, OCT4, PRDM14, MED24 and E4F1, inducing spontaneous differentiation of hESCs followed by widespread cell death. As SON acts as an intron splicing activator, the depletion of SON leads to increased intron retention and exon skipping in hESCs in regulatory genes of the cell cycle and hESC identity. Mutations in the SON gene and or SON haploinsufficiency compromises SON- mediated RNA splicing and contributes to the complex developmental defects observed in individuals with ZTTK syndrome. Erroneous SON function causes insufficient production of downstream targets, genome instability and disrupted cell cycle progression which are fundamental to the developmental defects and organ abnormalities in individuals with ZTTK syndrome. For example, FLNA haploinsufficiency observed in individuals with ZTTK syndrome is the main cause of a rare brain disorder, periventricular nodular heterotopia. De novo LoF mutations in TUBG1 can result in microcephaly and cortical malformations due to compromised SON-mediated RNA splicing in affected ZTTK syndrome individuals. The consequence of SON haploinsufficiency on embryonic development has also been studied in zebrafish animal models (Danio rerio). A range of developmental defects was observed, including bent, shortened or gnarled tails, massive body curvatures with deformed body axes, eye malformations and microcephaly. Embryos that survived for a longer period of time have more severe phenotypes such as spinal malformations with brain oedema, imitating features observed in affected ZTTK syndrome individuals.  Diagnosis   Brain Imaging  Early diagnosis of the ZTTK syndrome can be determined by brain imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain of ZTTK syndrome patients have revealed significant abnormalities. Abnormal gyration patterns were seen, including polymicrogyria; many unusually small folds in the brain, simplified gyria; reduced number and shallow appearance of gyri, and periventricular nodular heterotopia; failure of neurons to migrate properly during early development of the fetal brain. Ventriculomegaly can also be observed in MRI where the lateral ventricles become dilated in the foetus and can contribute to developmental delays in ZTTK syndrome individual. Another common feature observed in ZTTK syndrome patients is Arnold-Chiari malformations which are structural defects in the cerebellum that manifest during fetal development and can lead to vision problems, scoliosis or kyphosis in ZTTK syndrome patients. Other pathological features seen on MRI scans of ZTTK syndrome individuals include arachnoid cysts, hypoplasia of the corpus callosum and cerebellar hemispheres and loss of periventricular white matter. Most individuals with ZTTK syndrome are identified early in childhood due to developmental delays and intellectual disabilities. However, a formal diagnosis of intellectual disability can only be conducted by a performance of an IQ test score of below 70.  Whole Exome Sequencing  Whole exome sequencing (WES) can be used as a non-biased tool in the diagnostic evaluation of individuals with suspected genetic disorders such as the ZTTK syndrome. Using WES, individuals were identified with truncating variants of SON and overlapping clinical features. ZTTK syndrome has been identified as a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with a de novo mutation in the SON gene using WES. The SON gene is known to be a major cause of severe intellectual disability and consequent developmental disorders. The first de novo truncating variant in SON was recognised in a group of individuals with severe intellectual disabilities. Sanger sequencing or the use of WES of parental samples confirmed the de novo status of the truncating and missense mutations of the SON gene in the sampled ZTTK syndrome individuals. Variants identified included a premature stop variant in exon 3, frame-shift variants in exon 3 and a frameshift variant in exon 4.  Treatment  There is currently no treatment for ZTTK syndrome. However, physical therapy and addressing the specific problems of multi organ disorders may be helpful. The main focus should be on the diagnosis and care of individuals with ZTTK syndrome.

Attempting to bring the ritual initiation abuses to the authorities' attention, Tod accidentally dies after fleeing from the angry fraternity brothers. Medical professor Dr. Stephen Brice (Paul Henreid) then tries to end the practice of hazing, determined to obtain justice for one of his best students. Production Henreid had directed in theatre but this was his first film. He had produced two films before, Hollow Triumph and So Young, So Bad. Paul Henreid set up the project with Edward Nassour. They established HN Productions - for Henreid and Nassour. In March 1951 they arranged finance through Robert L. Lippert. Henreid and Lippert were secretive about the subject matter, describing it as \\"topical and controversial.\\" Henreid admitted he later kept the topic secret so no other produces would beat them to the screens with a similar story. Filming started 5 September 1951 at the General Service Studio. There had been a week's rehearsal beforehand. Filming took 16 days, and was completed two days ahead of schedule. Henreid said getting the script and finance and making the film took him a year. He says he originally wanted to call the film Hell Night but the distributors came up with For Men Only. Henreid wanted to make The Spanish Grandee and Ring around Saturn for Nassour but these were never made. Reception Henreid later said the film was \\"very successful\\" and credited it with launching his directing career.

It was located at Providence Works, Sutton, near St. Helens, England. The company's business included iron and brass founding and repairs to small locomotive engines. The company first started building railway locomotives in 1872, specializing in a single small well tank design, which it sold primarily to Brunner Mond, Pilkington Brothers, and United Alkali Company. By 1878 there were around 50 employees, a quarter of whom were young apprentices and boys. J.A. Borrows died in 1912 and the property was placed for sale. At this time the works covered \\"18,000 square yards or thereabouts\\". The locomotive manufacturing business was taken over by H. W. Johnson and Company. By 1913, around 40 locomotives had been built. Works numbers up to 58 were allocated, and some named locomotives are known, without knowing their works number. The discrepancy may be explained by the missing numbers having been allocated to some steam rollers, or other general machinery, which are known to have been built. Between 1912 and 1921, Kerr, Stuart & Co. built at least 17 more locomotives of this design for Brunner Mond. The final builds were three between 1913 and 1921, begun at the original Providence Works but completed at other sites nearby. In some years, up to three locomotives were completed in a year. In others there were none, and the works operated with other engineering work.  Design  Frames of Windle, 2016. The riveted well tank can just be seen, as can the guide for the valve spindle, fixed unusually to the outside of the frames. All of the Borrows locomotives were of the same design, with only detail variations. This had originated with James Cross in 1866. The design provided compact locomotives with a short wheelbase, but also a short overall length relative to this wheelbase, so that the overhang at each end remained short, avoided problems with the buffers swinging from side to side on sharp corners. The rear axle was placed beneath the firebox, rather than in front of it. The valvegear was conventional Stephenson, although it was placed unusually. As the firebox and well tank gave no room for conventional inside motion, the valvegear was instead placed between the wheels and the outside of the frames. This required the wheels to be overhung outside their bearing further than was usual, but this was not a problem on a light locomotive. The motion was also easily accessible for lubrication and maintenance. Because the slide valves were mounted outside of the frames, the smokebox curved outwards at the bottom to contain the steam pipes. The locos were early adopters of a Wakefield mechanical lubricator. At least some of the Pilkington's locomotives were rebuilt and reboilered with fewer boiler tubes. The design was a conventional well tank, with the tank made integral with the frames. This had a stiffening effect. After the Pilkington's rebuilding, separate tank sides were provided. This made the frames less rigid and gave trouble with racking.  Preservation  Willy the Well Tank at the Avon Valley Railway in 2013 Three Borrows locomotives are preserved. No. 3 (1898) is at the Tanfield Railway and The King (1906) and Windle (1909) are at the Ribble Steam Railway. A fourth locomotive, one of the Kerr, Stuart group, worked at National Shipyard No.1 in Chepstow and was preserved by Fairfield-Mabey bridge works. It is now in occasional gala service as Willy the Well-Tank.

Mobley was the daughter of Benjamin E. and Tennie Worsham Mobley, and was raised near Ardmore, Oklahoma; her father was white, while her mother was of Chickasaw descent. One of her sisters was Marie Muchmore, who would go on to witness, and film, the assassination of John F. Kennedy.. Surnames for Rose Hill Cemetery, Carter County, Oklahoma. Obituary of Robert Mobley , The Daily Ardmorite, April 25, 2001. One-quarter Chickasaw, she grew up in both cultures, and was especially close to her maternal grandmother, who spoke no English and taught her to do beadwork and to identify herbs and other edible things in nature. She also learned how to break horses and shoot a rifle, and became a member of the women's rifle team at the University of Oklahoma. Mobley initially studied piano as a child before transitioning into voice lessons. Her interest in opera developed in high school. She continued her study of music at the University of Georgia and at Christian College in Columbia, Missouri. She married Louis Brave, an Osage actor, in 1926, divorcing him in 1931. In 1929, Mobley auditioned for the Indian Ceremonials at the Hollywood Bowl. She was discovered by Charles Wakefield Cadman, who launched her career. At this time she adopted the name \\"Lushanya\\", meaning \\"songbird\\", and she was henceforth frequently known as the \\"Songbird of the Chickasaws\\". Invited by a promoter to appear in Germany, she received scholarships to study opera at the Berlin University of the Arts and the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome in the early 1930s. In 1935 she appeared in the annual performance of The Song of Hiawatha by Samuel Coleridge-Taylor at the Royal Albert Hall in London, singing the role of Minnehaha. She continued to sing solo roles in Los Angeles and Chicago, notably taking on the title role of Aida with the Chicago Opera Company in Trieste, the first person of native American descent to perform the part. Another signature piece was Cadman's opera Shanewis. Mobley was the first American Indian to sing at La Scala. She performed at the 1936 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. The following year she sang at the coronation of George VI of the United Kingdom. She also traveled overseas to entertain American soldiers during World War II. Mobley later married Ramón Vinay, retiring to manage his career. She died in Fort Worth, and is buried in her hometown of Ardmore. As Lushanya Vinay, Mobley was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame in 1964. She was inducted into the Chickasaw Nation Hall of Fame in 2009, an honor accepted in her stead by her niece, Aurelia Guy Phillips.

Her husband was Icelandic Nobel Literature laureate Halldór Laxness, and Auður worked as his secretary and writing collaborator for many years. In 2002, Auður received the Grand Cross of the Order of the Falcon for her contributions to Icelandic culture.  Early life and marriage  Auður was born in the Icelandic village of Eyrarbakki on July 20, 1918, to Halldóra Kristín Jónsdóttir and Sveinn Guðmundsson. Her father was a blacksmith and when she was seven years old they moved to Vesturbær, the west-end of Reykjavík. She attended the University of Iceland and passed an examination at the to become an X-ray technician. She began working as an X-ray specialist at the National University Hospital of Iceland in the late 1930s and would work there for twelve years. In 1937, she met the writer Halldór Laxness at her work. While she was working, she also enrolled in courses at the Icelandic Arts and Crafts School. In 1945, Auður married Laxness and the following year she graduated and passed her examinations in handicrafts. The couple had two daughters, Sigríður and Guðný, and they lived in a house called Gljúfrasteinn, located in Mosfellsbær. Auður supported her husband's writing as his secretary and \\"close collaborator\\" up until his death in 1998.  Writing, politics, and handicrafts  In 1944, Auður was among the founders of Melkorka, an Icelandic women's magazine. The magazine ran from 1944 to 1962, publishing both fiction and nonfiction on women's culture and politics. Auður was active in social affairs and women's rights campaigns during her lifetime. Two Icelandic girls wearing traditional Lopapeysa sweaters Auður held a position on the editorial board of crafts magazine Hugur og hönd, producing articles on traditional Icelandic handicrafts such as weaving and knitting. Outside of her writing, Auður also designed her own knitting patterns for Icelandic wool, taught at Varmárskóli Elementary School in Mosfellsbær for two years and worked briefly at the National Museum of Iceland.  Lopapeysa sweater pattern  In an interview with media in 1998, Auður claimed to be the originator of the famed Icelandic Lopapeysa sweater pattern. Although the true extent of her contributions has been disputed, historians generally believe that Auður did influence the final knitting pattern, possibly through her development of a \\"circular pattern over the shoulder\\" inspired by a book on Inca culture. Another theory suggests that Auður brought back a version of the sweater after a trip to Greenland and replicated it herself during the late 1940s, inspired by old Icelandic patterns and imported embroidery techniques.  Death  After spending her final years at a home for the elderly in Reykjavík, Auður passed away aged 94 on October 29, 2012.

Frida painted a portrait of Cristina, titled Portrait of Cristina, My Sister, and Diego Rivera, Frida's husband, also portrayed Cristina Kahlo in his work. Rivera painted Cristina in the nude, which hints towards the pair's affair. Personal life Cristina Kahlo y Calderón was born June 7, 1908, and was the youngest daughter of the Kahlo family. Her parents were Guillermo Kahlo and Matilde Calderón. Guillermo Kahlo, who worked as a photographer, had a previous marriage in which he had two children before his wife died. Cristina and Frida had two other sisters, named Matilde and Adriana, and two half sisters named María Luisa and Margarita. Cristina was eleven months younger than Frida, and the pair were very close. The Kahlo y Calderón family lived in a house built by Guillermo in Coyoacán, Mexico. Cristina came from a meager background but her father, Guillermo, a photographer during the Mexican Revolution when there was hardly a market for photographs, provided for her education. Cristina later married and had two children, Isolda and Antonio. Cristina's husband left her after the birth of Antonio. When Frida and Diego returned to Mexico as successful painters, Cristina acted as subject for both artists. She was one of Diego's favorite subjects, and he often painted her in the nude. Soon after her husband left, Cristina and Diego began an affair. Subject of Frida Kahlo Cristina and Frida were very close, and Frida used Cristina as an indirect and direct subject for some of her paintings. Frida painted Portrait of Cristina Kahlo near the start of Frida's career. Art historians note this painting's stylistic similarities to that of Diego's style. After this painting, Frida was able to find her own stylistic preferences. In Frida's painting Mi Nodriza y yo (\\"My wet-nurse and I\\") Cristina, although not in the painting, is its subject. The painting depicts Frida being breastfed by a wet-nurse as opposed to her own mother, because when Frida's mother became pregnant with Cristina she could no longer breastfeed Frida. Cristina is also an indirect subject of Frida's 1937 painting Memory, the Heart, a self-portrait displaying Frida with a metal rod going through an empty space in her chest. Art historians have suggested that this symbolizes \\"displacement of penetration.\\" In other words symbolizing Cristina's affair with Diego. The pole replacing her heart, which lays wounded and bleeding on the ground, also shows the immense pain which was the result of the affair. Subject of Diego Rivera Rivera portrays Cristina in his art work, and she was one of his favorite models. Cristina was depicted on the South Wall of Rivera's mural The History of Mexico: The World of Today and Tomorrow. She lies at the bottom of the mural alongside her children and Frida. This could be an indication of her importance to Diego. Pairing Frida and Cristina and her children showed the contradictions between the two. Frida appears statuesque while Cristina appears \\"lively.\\" Another contradiction was the aspect of Cristina being his lover and Frida his wife; and in addition Cristina had children and Frida did not. Cristina also appears in Rivera's Figure of Knowledge, in the Ministry of Health. Depicted in the nude, she holds a yonic shaped flower as a symbol of her femininity. Diego depicted her in the nude in another mural in the same building, although neither of the nude depictions were meant to be erotic but represented a vision of health and purity. Death Cristina and her children lived with Diego and Frida; together they were a family. Towards the end of Frida's life, Cristina looked after her and made her as comfortable as possible. After Frida's death, Cristina lived her life separate from Diego. Diego turned Cristina and Frida's house in Coyoacán into a museum of Frida's work; although Cristina was not pleased.

Since the mid-1940s, he was a member of many popular charangas, including Arcaño y sus Maravillas, Orquesta América and Fajardo y sus Estrellas. In 1959, after Fajardo went into exile, he became the leader of his orchestra, the Estrellas Cubanas, which he directed until his death. A prolific composer, his most performed danzones include \\"Angoa\\", \\"Los jóvenes del silencio\\" and \\"El niche\\". In the 1950s, he primarily wrote chachachás and his bolero \\"Si te contara\\" became a standard of the genre. Life and career Born in Trinidad, Sancti Spíritus, Cuba, Félix Reina began his musical studies with his father and with violin teacher Isidro Cintra. After playing in local orchestras for some time, he moved to Havana in 1946, joining the charanga directed by flutist José Antonio Díaz. Soon, he joined Arcaño y sus Maravillas, which was very popular at the time. Directed by flutist Antonio Arcaño, cousin of Díaz, the orchestra featured musicians such as Israel López \\"Cachao\\", Orestes López and Ulpiano Díaz, which were responsible for the development of the danzón- mambo in the late 1930s. At the time of Reina's arrival, the Maravillas were a mainstay of Havana's Radio Mil Diez, earning the nickname \\"La Radiofónica\\". Reina soon contributed several danzones to the group's repertoire including \\"Angoa\\", \\"Los jóvenes del silencio\\" and \\"El niche\\". The latter was covered by Machito and many other bands thereafter. In 1950, Reina became a member of the newly formed Fajardo y sus Estrellas, he then directed his own orchestra for a short period of time before joining Orquesta América in 1954 at the height of the chachachá craze. The América, directed by Ninón Mondéjar, was the group that pioneered the genre thanks to its first violin Enrique Jorrín. After touring México with the América, Jorrín decided to stay in the country for some time with hiw own group, and Reina stayed with him. In 1958, back in Cuba, Reina re-joined José Fajardo y sus Estrellas. Both Jorrín and Fajardo were former members of the Maravillas, like Reina. In June 1959, after touring Japan, Fajardo decided to stay in the United States on their way back to Cuba. Reina and most of the musicians returned to Havana and began working without Fajardo. With Reina as the new leader, the band was renamed Orquesta Estrellas Cubanas and would remain active for the rest of the 20th century. In the 1960s, his bolero \\"Si te contara\\" was covered by singers in both Cuba and the United States, thus entering the Latin music repertoire, where it remains a popular song. Among its notable performers are Antonio Machín, Elena Burke, Panchito Riset, Omara Portuondo, Rubén González and Diego el Cigala. In 1962, \\"Vuela la paloma\\", composed by Reina, became a hit for Tito Rodríguez, and was later covered by Johnny Pacheco and others. Reina died on February 10, 1998, in Havana's Calixto García Hospital, having suffered a stroke in his home in Vedado. The Estrellas Cubanas continued performing, now under the direction of violinist Gilberto Valdés.

He wrote a trilogy of plays dealing with events during the Paraguayan War, multiple plays exploring Paraguayan mythology and Guaraní folklore, and several librettos for musical comedies and zarzuelas. The situation of Paraguayan tenant farmers is a recurring theme in his work. His novel Un viento negro (A Black Wind), for which he won the 2013 Paraguayan National Prize for Literature, explores the terror of life under the repressive Stroessner dictatorship, which ruled Paraguay for thirty-five years (from 1954 to 1989).

These stresses can lead to fracturing or plastic deformation depending on the other variables of heating, which include material types and constraints. Temperature gradients, thermal expansion or contraction and thermal shocks are things that can lead to thermal stress. This type of stress is highly dependent on the thermal expansion coefficient which varies from material to material. In general, the greater the temperature change, the higher the level of stress that can occur. Thermal shock can result from a rapid change in temperature, resulting in cracking or shattering.  Temperature gradients  When a material is rapidly heated or cooled, the surface and internal temperature will have a difference in temperature. Quick heating or cooling causes localized areas of thermal expansion or contraction, this localized movement of material causes thermal stresses. Imagine heating a cylinder, first the surface rises in temperature and the center remains the same initial temperature. After some time the center of the cylinder will reach the same temperature as the surface. During the heat up the surface is relatively hotter and will expand more than the center. An example of this is dental fillings can cause thermal stress in a person's mouth. Sometimes dentists use dental fillings with different thermal expansion coefficients than tooth enamel, the fillings will expand faster than the enamel and cause pain in a person's mouth.  Thermal expansion or contraction  Example of deformation induced by thermal stress on the rails Material will expand or contract depending on the material's thermal expansion coefficient. As long as the material is free to move, the material can expand or contract freely without generating stresses. Once this material is attached to a rigid body at multiple locations, thermal stresses can be created in the geometrically constrained region. This stress is calculated by multiplying the change in temperature, material's thermal expansion coefficient and material's Young's modulus (see formula below). E is Young's modulus, α is thermal expansion coefficient, To is temperature original, and Tf is the final temperature. σ=Εα(Tf-To)=ΕαΔT When Tf is greater than To, the constraints exert a compressive force on the material. The opposite happens while cooling; when Tf is less than To, the stress will be tensile. A welding example involves heating and cooling of metal which is a combination of thermal expansion, contraction, and temperature gradients. After a full cycle of heating and cooling, the metal is left with residual stress around the weld. Thermal shock This is a combination of a large temperature gradient in addition to rapid change in temperature on brittle materials. The change in temperature causes stresses on the surface that are in tension, which encourages crack formation and propagation. Ceramics materials are usually susceptible to thermal shock. An example is when glass is heated up to a high temperature and then quickly quenched in cold water. As the temperature of the glass falls rapidly, stresses are induced and causes fractures in the body of the glass which can be seen as cracks or even shattering in some cases.

In May 1935, she became president of Southeastern Oklahoma State Teachers College, becoming the first woman to lead a state college or university in the United States. Early life Born Kathrine Benton Galt in Spring Place, Georgia, Zaneis was the fourth of eight children, four sons and four daughters, of James Edward and Miriam Otis Galt. The family lived in Ardmore, Oklahoma, but would return to Georgia for Miriam to give birth; not long thereafter, they returned westward. Kate graduated from high school in Ardmore in 1907; she was immediately hired by school superintendent Charles Evans to teach. In 1913 she married H. P Zaneis, moving with him to Wirt, Oklahoma; two years later, divorced, she returned to Ardmore to serve as principal of Lincoln Ward School. In 1915 she became superintendent of Lone Grove High School, at the same time joining the summer teaching faculty at Southeastern Oklahoma State Teachers College. In 1920, working towards a bachelor's degree at the same institution, she was elected superintendent of schools in Carter County, pledging to consolidate rural schools. She also worked to improve the condition of schools for black children in the county. Upon completing her term as superintendent, Zaneis enrolled at Southeastern Oklahoma State, from which she graduated in 1926. While in school, Zaneis met Pearl Brent, who her mother hired to be the family's housekeeper. Brent remained Zaneis' housekeeper, assistant, and best friend for the rest of their lives. After graduating, Zaneis returned to Carter County to teach. When the Great Depression caused funding shortfalls which resulted in teachers being paid in warrants, Zaneis condemned the practice. Her position on this issue led her to support E. W. Marland in his campaign for governor, during which she served as his campaign director for Carter County. She was rewarded after his election with a position on the Oklahoma State Board of Education; among her achievements on that body was approval of sabbatical leaves for college faculty. On the cusp of receiving her master's degree from Oklahoma A&M;, she was named president of Southeastern Oklahoma State Teachers College by Governor Marland, effective May 20, 1935. In accepting the position, Zaneis became the first woman to head a state institution of higher learning in the United States; regardless, she stated in an interview that she expected to \\"succeed or fail in this job on my own merits, without the fact that I'm the only woman to head a state college.\\" Tenure as college president Zaneis' tenure in the role was short and not without controversy, beginning when she appointed her favorite instructor, Dr. Everett Fixley, as dean, and continuing with the firing of faculty members without master's degrees. Furthermore, the salaries of the higher-paid men on staff were cut to adjust the pay scale of female faculty members, causing problems with townspeople. Successes included the securing of Public Works Administration funds to improve buildings and athletic fields on campus; mandatory political donations from faculty were ended, enrollment increased by 30%, and student work programs were funded. Furthermore, she secured a speaking appearance by Eleanor Roosevelt. But public sentiment in Oklahoma was turning against the New Deal, and with the men of the faculty upset the State Board of Education fired Zaneis from her post in May 1937. No clear reason was ever given, but it was widely said, including by prominent and influential local figures such as Claude C. Hatchett, that she had been removed because of her gender. Another woman would not be named to the school's presidency until Joe Anna Hibbler took the position in 1991. Zaneis' firing inspired the formation of the Women's Democratic Council, a group of local activists who believed she was fired because of her gender; Zaneis led the group, which advocated for women's participation in politics, for six years. Later life Zaneis continued her work in her chosen field, serving as director of education for the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety and working on the state's school lunch program, first through the Oklahoma Department of Public Welfare and later through the Oklahoma Department of Education. In her later career, she transferred between various state agencies, including a stint with the newly formed Civil Defense Agency in the 1950s, before retiring in 1963 and moving back to her native Ardmore with Brent. In 1973, Brent died unexpectedly of a sudden fall; Zaneis became distraught over her death and never recovered. She died on September 9 of the same year in Ardmore Memorial Hospital and was buried in Ardmore's Rosehill Cemetery. A school in Carter County, erected in 1923, was named for Zaneis, while her portrait, painted by Southeastern Oklahoma State Teachers College faculty member Minnie Baker, is displayed at the Oklahoma Historical Society.

Political actors from Mexico and the United States negotiated the settlement over the course of 1927 and 1928, after “a decade of wrangling” between the two countries that followed the creation of the Mexican Constitution of 1917. Succinctly, Calles-Morrow affirmed the legitimacy of oil-land titles obtained, and maintained, by foreign industries prior to the ratification of the 1917 Constitution. The political statement conveyed by the accord remains a topic of interpretive debate. Some historians argue that Calles-Morrow revealed a delicate partiality on the part of Mexican president Plutarco Elías Calles toward foreign companies: concisely summarized, “where ‘positive acts’ had been performed prior to 1917, the companies received confirmatory concessions of indefinite duration.” Others more drastically assert that through this agreement, Calles “attempted completely to surrender the country to foreign imperialism.” Upon President Calles’ entrance into office, it appeared as though his predecessor, Álvaro Obregón’s, “personal promise to ease the pressure on the oil firms” would disintegrate under the new administration. When he served as the minister of industry, then-General Calles had attempted to negotiate an interim agreement affording “provisional” oil-drilling permits to international operators, contingent on their compliance with regulations determined by the Mexican government. Foreign oil executives recoiled at the proposition, however, as they were “no more willing to comply with future legislation… than to pay royalties on land they already held under private contract.” Tensions between Calles’ administration and oil companies escalated to such an extent that in early 1927, foreign outfits began drilling illegally with the intention of prompting a governmental counter-response. Sensing the looming menace of U.S. military involvement, Calles directed Mexican troops to seal oil wells and valves, before finally commanding General Lázaro Cárdenas to execute arson, strategically, at foreign-oil sites. At the heart of the confrontation was a desire—notably shared by both sides—to resolve the fiscal and constitutional uncertainties (e.g. exactions and “pre-constitutional property rights”) surrounding oil production, following the drastic redefinitions that emerged from the Mexican Revolution. With the financial downturn that occurred in Mexico in 1927, Calles came to view an accord with foreign oil companies as an economic exigency. However, the president remained “well aware of national [aversion toward] placing the control of natural resources in the hands of foreigners,” so he strove, in a shrewd political move, to “criticize[] the foreign oil companies while simultaneously creating a legal basis for their continued operation in Mexico.” As an agreement appeared increasingly imminent, social commentators of the day remarked that Calles’ possessed three potential directions: he could “actually confiscate oil fields held by Americans”; continue professing support for the 1917 Constitution, while avoiding any sort of concrete confiscation measures, behind the scenes; or else “admit the legality of American titles to Mexican oil lands.” Into the scene stepped U.S. Ambassador Dwight Morrow, a former “corporate lawyer and partner in… J.P. Morgan” whose banking history linked him to a number of Mexico’s creditors. Morrow made a significant impression on Calles, who proved receptive to Morrow’s alleged “face-saving solution… [in which the] Mexican Supreme Court would declare the [existing petroleum] law to be ex post facto.” As a result of the pair’s relative rapport, the titular agreement finally took shape. Calles’ government altered the standing Petroleum Act of 1925 to permit the extension of so-called “confirmatory concessions” to oil corporations that had obtained their subsoil rights before the midway mark of 1917. These concessions were dealt to applicant oil companies “without limitation[s] of time.” Further, Calles successfully lobbied the State Department to embrace the notion of “positive acts,” in which corporations would relinquish claims to “pre-1917 oil reserves on which they had made no improvements.” Oil companies did not receive the Calles-Morrow agreement well, as many claimed that “the new legislation did not go far enough” in securing them a lasting presence in Mexico. Finding the concept of “concessions” to be condescending, recalcitrant petroleum executives desired “an amendment to the 1917 Constitution or a comprehensive definition of what were their rights on May 1, 1917.” Nonetheless, on the whole, U.S.-Mexican relations proceeded amicably for the remainder of Calles’ tenure, largely due to the Mexican president’s increasingly conservative leanings, which advantaged U.S. commercial interests. In the end, however, Calles’ successor, Lázaro Cárdenas, effectively dismantled the Calles-Morrow agreement as he initiated an economic transition “from a phase of postrevolutionary reconstruction… to one of depression-induced industrialization and state intervention,” which manifested, finally, in the Mexican oil expropriation.

The closest small towns to the port are the towns of Satui and Sebamban, and the closest large town is that of Banjarmasin. Port information The port of Muara Satui is similar to Taboneo in that all cargo loading and discharging operations are carried out in the large open anchorage by cranes and barges. Tugs with barges laden with coal come alongside ships in the anchorage and carry out loading operations with ships cranes or shore cranes. It is common to find 3 to 5 barges alongside a single ship. Another anchorage loading port at Muara Sebamban lies 5 miles to the east of Muara Satui. The port is a popular loading port for coal, nickel ore and iron ore and has a depth of 14 metres. Operations continue around the clock with a loading rate of 8000-10,000 tonnes per day. The coal loaded at the anchorage is sometimes referred to as \\"Satui coal\\" is a variety of bituminous coal (coking coal) and originates in the Satui mines and WBM mines. The mines contain deposits of Karuh, Kintap, Satui and Bukit Baru. Satui coal seams themselves are sub-divided based on their ash content. Though the coal requires crushing, due to its low ash content it does not require washing. Satui coals are crushed at facilities adjacent to the Muara Satui anchorage port and then stacked into stockpiles representing different Satui products. These stockpiles are sometimes blended, thus allowing coal of desired quality specifications to be loaded for ships.

She made her literary debut in 2009 when her novel Wizard Bakery (위저드 베이커리 Wizard Bakery) won the 2nd Changbi Prize for Young Adult Fiction. Her 2015 short story collection Geugeosi namaneun anigireul (그것이 나만은 아니기를 I Hope It's Not Just Me) received the Today's Writer Award and Hwang Sun-won New Writers' Award. She penned the novels Pigeumalion aideul (피그말리온 아이들 The Pygmalion Children), Agami (아가미 Gills), and Bangjuro oseyo (방주로 오세요 Come to Bangju) as well as the short story collection Goineun aniyeotjiman (고의는 아니지만 I Didn't Mean to But). Gu's debut novel Wijeodeu Beikeori was translated into Spanish by Minjeong Jeong and Irma Zyanja Gil Yáñez. They received the 24th Daesan Literary Award in 2016 for their translation.  Life  Gu Byeong-mo was born in Seoul, South Korea in 1976. She read extensively from a young age, reportedly borrowing books from a well-off friend's library as a middle school student and reading cheap pocketbooks her older sister sometimes brought home. She said in an interview that she read Demian by Hermann Hesse until the cover wore off. She decided to become a writer at the age of 12 and submitted a story to a newspaper-run writer's contest in her last year of high school. Gu studied Korean literature at Kyung Hee University. Upon graduation, she joined a publisher as an editor. She made her literary debut in 2009, and has since focused on writing. When she is not writing, she likes to spend time with her child. She moved to Jinju, South Korea in early 2015. She reads or writes during train rides between Jinju and Seoul when she has to visit the latter to promote her new releases.  Writing  Many of Gu Byeong-mo's works are genre fiction. Her debut novel Wijeodeu beikeori (위저드 베이커리 Wizard Bakery) mixes mystery, horror, and fantasy. It is the first young adult novel in South Korea to employ magic as a major plot device, breaking the convention of the genre to deal with only realistic settings. The judges of the Changbi Prize for Young Adult Fiction chose Wijeodeu as the winner because it is a fantastical allegory that deviates from the standard coming-of-age story set in schools. Gu's later works are also allegories that use unusual motifs to reveal a dark side of reality. “Hwagapsonyeojeon” (화갑소녀전 Tale of the Match Girl) is a short story based on “The Little Match Girl” by Hans Christian Andersen. But instead of seeing wonderful visions in the glow of her matches, the protagonist only sees scenes of horror and tragedy. The story urges readers to question commonly accepted truths or lessons and to view the world in a new light.

In the One Week War, Kazuya finds himself in a civil war between himself and Dukes Georg Carmine and Castor Vargas while also having to fight the Principality of Amidonia. Through a series of military strategies, Kazuya emerges victorious and annexes Amidonia (although this was entirely unplanned on his part) to create the Unified Kingdom of Elfrieden and Amidonia, otherwise known as the Kingdom of Friedonia.

He serves as Kazuya's right-hand man and has extremely great insight into the human psyche. He is casual friends with Jeanne Euphoria, the younger sister of Maria Euphoria, the Empress of the Gran Chaos Empire. ; : The Minister of Agriculture and Foresty of the Elfriedon Kingdom, Poncho Panacotta is one of the 5 people discovered during the gathering of the Gifted People. Due to his vast knowledge of edible delicacies, he was a key player in ending the food shortages in the kingdom. Kazuya has given him the name of Ishizuka. ; : A member of the Mystic Wolf race and one of the 5 people discovered during the gathering of the Gifted People, Tomoe Inui possesses the rare ability to speak to all manner of beasts and animals. When it was revealed that she could speak to a demon, Kazuya immediately recognized her as extremely valuable and she was adopted by Albert and Elisha Elfrieden in order to shelter her, in the process, becoming Kazuya's sister-in-law-to-be and Liscia's adoptive sister. ; : Son of the noble house of Magna and member of the Elfrieden Army under Duke Georg Carmine. He met Souma when the king overheard an argument between Halbert and his childhood friend Kaede Foxia. Rather than being arrested for Lese Majeste, Halbert was instead transferred to the Forbidden Army, under Souma's jurisdiction. The two have since become friends, and Halbert is one of the few people permitted to disregard the rules of royal etiquette with Souma and carry on a causal conversation. In the aftermath of the Storm Crisis, it is revealed that he and Kaede have recently gotten engaged. He is also partnered with Ruby, a Red Dragon of the Star Dragon Mountain Range. ; : A member of the Mystic Fox race, Kaede is the daughter of the noble house of Foxia, and childhood friend to Halbert Magna. She is an intelligent and talented young woman, and a Mage in the Forbidden Army specialising in Earth Magic. She is currently serving as a staff officer under Captain Ludwin Arcs and is Hal's direct superior, a situation that both pleases and irritates the both of them at times. Kaede cares deeply for Hal, and she spoke in his defense when the two first met king Souma. In the aftermath of the Storm Crisis, it is revealed that she is engaged to Halbert when she chastises him for unthinkingly riding on Ruby's back. ; : Captain of the Royal Guard and Commander of the Forbidden Army under the direct command of King Souma. He is a popular man in Souma's royal court, but despite his looks and position, remains unattached. This is mainly due to rumours of financial trouble, as Ludwin is often seen eating the cheapest items on offer in the castle's cafeteria. He is childhood friends with Genia Maxwell, whom he regards with a brotherly affection, despite her eccentricity. After Souma realizes Genia's usefulness as an inventor, he and Liscia pressure Ludwin into an engagement to Genia, which he shyly accepts. ; : Last of the noble house of Maxwell, and childhood friend of Ludwin Arcs. She is an eccentric genius and self-proclaimed Overscientist, specialising in the study of technology and artifacts discovered in the various dungeons found throughout the world. Her talents have been recognised by Souma, and the king is currently seeking to develop and implement several of her inventions for the good of the kingdom. In order to ensure her safety and continued loyalty, Souma and Liscia convince Ludwin and Genia to get engaged, which Genia shows some minor affections for, but states that she was certain that it would happen someday. ; : A sea serpent who is over 500 years old at the time of Souma's summoning. Despite her age, as a member of a 'long-lived' race she still has the appearance of a human in her mid-to-late twenties. She is the Admiral of the Kingdom of Elfrieden's Navy, based in Lagoon City of the Walter Duchy. She is the only one of the three duchies to publicly side with Souma during the Civil War. : ; : A dragonewt and the General of the Kingdom of Elfrieden's Air Force. He is a loyal and skilled warrior, yet is impulsive to action. As the head of the Vargas Duchy, he opted during the Civil War to have the Air Force take a neutral stance, but publicly supported Duke Carmine with his personal members of the Air Force. In his youth, he attempted to engage in romantic relations with Duchess Excel Walter, but was rejected. He ended up marrying one of the duchess's daughters, making him her son-in-law. Though defeated during the Civil War, Souma decided to spare Castor from execution for his treason. ; : A dragonewt and daughter of Castor Vargas. She is Castor's eldest child, also having a younger brother named Carl. She is friends with Liscia from their time together at the military academy. Despite Liscia's attempts to use Carla's connection to Castor, Liscia was unable to convince both to support Souma during the Civil War. Carla sided with her father during the Civil War despite Castor's attempt to disinherit her along with her mother and brother as to spare her from potential treason charges. Souma decided to likewise spare Carla from execution for treason, forcing her to become one of the royal families maids instead. ; : A lion-headed beastman and General of the Kingdom of Elfrieden's Army. He was a loyal vassel, a widely respected tactician, and a mentor to Liscia. However, during the Civil War, he was the public opposition to Souma's reign as king. It is revealed after being defeated during the Civil War that he actually supported Souma's decisions, but was sacrificing himself to be a rally point for Souma's domestic enemies within the nobility of Elfrieden. Though he would be sentenced to be executed for treason, Souma offered him 'poisoned wine' to escape his sentence. Though officially dead, according to an Elfrieden news report, a leader of Souma's personal spy network, the Black Cats, looks suspiciously like the 'late' duke. ; : The previous king of Elfrieden before Souma and father of Liscia. He was regarded as a friendly, yet overall weak, king. In order to satisfy the demands of the Gran Chaos Empire for either supporting funds or a summoned hero, he orders the summoning which brought Souma to the world. After seeing Souma's initial plans, he abdicates the throne to Souma and arranges for Liscia to be married to him. Albert married into the royal family through Elisha and thus is not technically the blood royal. ; : The previous queen of Elfrieden before Souma and mother of Liscia. She is a quiet woman who leaves the decisions of leadership to Albert, despite technically being the blood royal. She is the sole survivor of the royal family from the succession war that occurred after 'the king before the previous king' died (the 'previous king' being Albert). She possesses a dark- type magical ability which she reveals to Souma after the events of the Civil War. Her ability enables her to send memories to her past self in order to change patterns of events. She can also use this ability on others at the same time. It is revealed that this ability was the reason she was the survivor of the succession war and was the catalyst for why Albert abdicated the throne to Souma. ; : The former Minister of Finance of Amidonia and current Minister of Finance of Friedonia. Along with Roroa Amidonia, he attempted to dissuade Gaius and Julius Amidonia from invading Elfrieden but was unsuccessful, resulting in the One Week War. Before conflict could occur, he disappeared from the Amidonian capital of Van along with Roroa and several other bureaucrats loyal to her. During the Amidonian revolution, he returned with the others and was granted his current position by Souma. Principality of Amidonia ; : The last sovereign prince of the Principality of Amidonia, Gaius Amidonia the Eighth is one of the major players during the One Week War. Having trespassed the southwestern border of Elfrieden, Gaius laid siege to the city of Altomura. In a clever plan crafted by Kazuya, Hakuya, and Georg Carmine, Elfrieden was able to outwit Gaius, forcing him to flee back into Amidonia proper. In the subsequent battle, Kazuya himself ended Gaius's life but not before Gaius instructed his son to keep the flames of vengeance burning. Gaius's death resulted in the Elfrieden occupation of Amidonia's capital city, Van. ; : The son of Gaius and the older brother of Roroa, Julius Amidonia is the prince who hastily inherited his post from his father prior to his death. However, after negotiations with the Gran Chaos Empire ended and Julius was given back his country to govern, rebellions soon rose up. Julius himself was driven out of the country, fleeing to the Empire, and with Roroa's intervention, the Principality of Amidonia was annexed into Elfrieden with the added bonus of Princess Roroa's hand in marriage. Gran Chaos Empire ; : Known as the Saint, Maria Euphoria is the Empress of the Gran Chaos Empire. Having held up the Declaration of Mankind's Common Front Against the Demon Race, simply, the Mankind Declaration, she is Kazuya's idealistic opposite. After the One Week War and the annexation of Amidonia, Kazuya and Maria forged a secret alliance in order to prepare for a full-on war with the Demon Lord's Domain. ; : The younger sister of Maria Euphoria, she was the one sent my the Gran Chaos Empire to take part in the negotiations of the Kingdom of Elfrieden and the Principality of Amidonia. Since then, she has been in constant contact with the Kingdom of Elfrieden (now the Kingdom of Friedonia) through the broadcasting jewel, especially with the prime minister Hakuya Kwonmin with whom she shares a close relationship with, despite having rarely met him in person. Star Dragon Mountain Range ; : Also known as the Mother Dragon, she is an ancient dragon who is the ruler of the Star Dragon Mountain Range. Her age is unknown, but also possesses the title of Old One, which she does not have the authority to explain. She has great magical powers including transformation into a human form, a form of telepathy, and teleportation abilities. ; : A red dragon who called the Star Dragon Mountain Range home. She was one of the dragons that bullied Naden directly due to her appearance and abilities. During the Storm Crisis in the Star Dragon Mountain Range, she was beaten by the other dragons as they blamed her for Naden's disappearance. After Naden's return, she was the first to decide to help Naden in order to restore her pride in herself. Despite her inability to utilize her wings in the storm, with the assistance of Halbert, she plunged into the storm and aided Naden for several moments before carrying a message to the other dragons. As during these events Halbert rode on her back, Ruby was no longer considered chaste and was contract partnered with Halbert with the blessing of the Mother Dragon. ;Pai : A white dragon and the only one that Naden considers a friend. Pai often shows concern for Naden and constantly supports her despite not fully understanding Naden's obsessions with human culture. ;Sapphire : A blue dragon and one of Ruby's companions when bullying Naden. ;Emerada : A green dragon and one of Ruby's companions when bullying Naden.

Symbolism  Another version of the flag. The plough symbolizes the peasants' leadership in rural areas, and the red color stands for the victory of the communist revolution. When it is depicted in works of art, it is generally shown in conjunction with Mao Zedong and/or armed peasants. An example of this can be found in an illustrated pamphlet titled \\"'This is fine' - In memory of the 44th anniversary of the publication of 'Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan\\"', published by the People's Press of Guangdong, where the illustrator uses the plough flag as a symbol of the peasant movement.  History  Plough Flag used by the left wing of the Kuomintang. It is believed that Peng Pai () was the first to use this flag in 1923, as the Chairman of the Peasants' Associationhttp://marxists.anu.edu.au/chinese/reference- books/pengpai/pengpai-192601.htm of Hailufeng. During the period of first United Front, when the peasant movement in China was at its peakhttp://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64184/64186/66630/4489485.html, the plough appeared in the flag and membership cards of the local peasant associations in several provinces. Another version of the flag, used by the left-wing of the Kuomintang, combines the plough with the Flag of the Republic of China. After July 15, 1927, when the Communist Party was made illegal in Wuhanhttp://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64184/64186/66630/4489465.html, the associations controlled by the communists stopped using the \\"Kuomintang\\" version of the flaghttp://www.hprc.org.cn/pdf/DSYJ198311006.pdfhttp://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64184/64186/66631/4489551.html and instead began using a version with a completely red backgroundhttp://www.dooland.com/magazine/article_471554.html. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, plough flags have been placed in several museums around the country (e.g. the museum of Guangxi) as well as being featured in paintings as the symbol of the peasant movement during the Encirclement Campaigns.

Gameplay Intruder, designed by B. Dennis Sustare, is based on the movie Alien, in which a rapidly maturing alien roams a spaceship, ambushing and killing crew members. In Intruder, a young alien life form has escaped from the labs of the space station Prometheus, and hunts members of the crew as it matures and gains new abilities. It is up to the crew to find the alien and either capture it when it is young, or kill it in its later life stages before crew losses become unacceptable. If all else fails, the crew can initiate a self-destruct sequence to destroy the Prometheus while escaping by shuttle; however, there is a chance that the alien will also escape by stowing away on one of the shuttles. The provided map shows the various areas and corridors of the Prometheus. The sequence of play in each turn is: * Movement of alien: Facedown counters (one of which is the alien) are moved randomly * Interaction phase: Crew members can investigate facedown counters to try to determine the location of the alien. Combat may ensue. * Panic phase: If a crew member is killed, all crew members retreat to the command module and the facedown counters are again moved randomly, hiding the new location of the alien. * Metamorphosis phase: A die is rolled to see if the alien matures and gains new abilities. * Movement phase: the crew can move to search for the alien or reach caches of weapons or technology. If they reach a facedown counter, interaction combat with the alien may result. * Self destruct advances: If the self-destruct sequence has been initiated, the sequence advances by one step. The game components are a 16\\" x 20\\" paper map, 54 die-cut counters and a 16-page rulebook, packaged in a zip-lock bag. Reception In the May-June 1980 edition of The Space Gamer (Issue No. 28), Jerry Epperson was not impressed by Intruder, saying, \\"I was somewhat disappointed. This one is for solitaire gamers, or others who are really hard up for new sci-fi games.\\" In the July 1980 edition of Dragon, Tony Watson liked Intruder, saying, \\"There was a game in that movie [Alien], and Task Force has done a fine job of extracting and offering it to us in a pocket-game format.\\" Watson enjoyed the quick turns that resulted in gameplay of only 45 minutes. His only complaints were about a couple of glitches in the rules, and the shiny finish on the counters, which sometimes revealed the location of the facedown alien due to reflection. Watson recommended the game, saying, \\"The game... is a lot of fun. The situation is tense and games are often close. The Intruder is truly a mean monster and the player will have to use some brains to defeat it.\\" Roger Sandell reviewed Intruder for White Dwarf #21, giving it an overall rating of 6 out of 10, and stated that \\"in the end, my feeling is that this game is a good idea which needs further development. It would have been nice to have seen a game system that, like The Creature that Ate Sheboygan, allowed the Intruder to be radically different each time.\\" References Board games introduced in 1980 Task Force Games games ","title":"Intruder (board game)"},{"id":"55348749","text":"Louis-Francois-Auguste de Rohan-Chabot (1788-1833) was a French aristocrat and Catholic priest.

She made her literary debut in 1997 when the journal La Plume published her short story “Kkumkkuneun marionetteu” (꿈꾸는 마리오네뜨 The Dreaming Marionette) and novella Sangja sogeui pureun kal (상자 속의 푸른 칼 Blue Knife in the Box). She won the 26th Yi Sang Literary Award in 2002 for her short story \\"Baemjangeo styu\\" (뱀장어 스튜 Eel Stew) and the 6th Dongin Literary Award in 2005 for Kkotgemudeom (꽃게무덤 Crab Grave).  Life  Kwon Ji-ye was born in Gyeongju, South Korea in 1960. She studied English literature at Ewha Womans University. In her time at Ewha, she was part of the literary society Darakbang (“Attic”) and won a writing contest run by the school. After graduating, however, her full-time job kept her from writing for nearly a decade. Her first job was at the publisher Minumsa and she went on to teach at a middle school. Then in 1991, she left for France and enrolled in the Asian studies program at Paris Diderot University. She wrote her doctoral dissertation on women in modern Korean literature. The reason Kwon decided to continue her studies was that she believed a writing career would make her unhappy, even though she had wanted to become a writer since she was a student. Yet her stay in Paris turned out to spur her literary ambitions. She began writing to cope with the loneliness of living abroad. She made her literary debut in 1997 while she was still in Paris. In 1999, she returned to South Korea to focus on her literary career. She taught creative writing at Hanzhong University, but quit in 2003 to write full-time.  Writing  A central theme in Kwon Ji-ye’s works is love. Her novels often feature the voices of women who yearn for passion in their lives. They explore the psychology of women in love and portray how love breaks down and disappears in our everyday lives. Kwon’s female protagonists often find romance through steamy affairs. They tend to have marriage troubles and attempt to fight their romantic fantasies or desire for an exciting life. Kwon’s first short story collection Kkumkkuneun marionetteu (꿈꾸는 마리오네뜨 The Dreaming Marionette) depicts protagonists cheating on their partners driven by lust. Yuhok (유혹 Seduction) is about a divorced college lecturer named Oh Yumi who flouts traditional sexual ethics and has multiple lovers. Not all of Kwon’s works focus on desires that deviate from social norms. Her 2010 novel Sawoleui mulgogi (4월의 물고기 April Fish) is about a pair of destined lovers in a monogamous relationship. Kwon mentioned in an interview that her views on love have changed as she grew older.

It was led by the Communist Party of China until its dissolution in 1964. Its successor was the Chinese National Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Association (), created in 1964 and dissolved de facto in 1986.  History  Flag of Guangdong Peasants' Association during the period of the First United Front It is believed that Peng Pai () organized the first peasants' association in 1921 and then the first general association in 1923, within the short-lived Hailufeng Soviet. He designed the seal and flag of organization. The plough—a traditional symbol of the peasantry—appeared in both the flag and member cards made by the local peasant associations. Before the Shanghai massacre of 1927, the Chinese peasant movement was at its peak. In Guangxi, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei and a few other provinces, many peasant associations organized by the Communist Party of China and left-wing Kuomintang under the direction of the KrestinternQuoted in Carr, Socialism in One Country, vol. 3, pt. 2, pp. 784-785. and Comintern. In April 1927 the 1st Provisional Executive Committee of the Chinese National Federation of Peasants' Associations was formed in order to prevent the Chinese peasant movement from failure. The members tried to organize the first National Peasants' Congress and help local associations from being dissolved by the armed forces of \\"local tyrants & evil gentry\\" and right-wing warlords. However, due to the inapposite direction from the CCP central committee and Comintern, they failed and the provisional committee itself was no longer existing de facto after 1927. Mao Zedong may be the most famous leader of the peasant movement. He organized the association of Hunan in 1926, which nearly half the peasants in the province (roughly 10 million) joined.2.htm After he investigated the associations again in 1927, he wrote \\"Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan\\" to prove that his way of organizing peasants was right and to provide a rebuttal to Chen Duxiu's ideas of peasant organization and about giving up mass work. The phrase, \\"Down with the local tyrants and evil gentry! All power to the peasants' association!\\" () was representative of Mao's way of peasant organizing. During the first stage of the Chinese Civil War (1927-1937), Mao Zedong made use of the associations in Hunan to further the communist cause, and lead the peasants into battle in the Autumn Harvest Uprising of September 1927. The Secretary-General of the peasants' association of Jiangxi province, Shu Guofan, successor to Fang Zhimin, was involved in the Nanchang Uprising around the same time. In the Chinese Soviet Republic, the association helped organize the peasants in the agrarian revolution.Marxists/mao/02.pdf After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the peasants' association and then the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Associations served mainly to aid the new communist government with the land reform, and then the introduction of People's communes as a provisional organ of power. On July 24, 1986, the last provincial-level Peasants' Association in Hubei was dissolved.  Organization  In all villages branch and local committee were organized. And from counties to provinces there're the general association() . The supreme leading bodies were the National Peasants' Congress and the Committee of the All-China Federation of Peasants' Associations, elected by the congress. The committee elected the standing committee consisting of a chairman, vice chairmen and committee members, in charge of daily functions. The leading bodies of different levels were local peasants' congresses and their committees of association elected by the congresses. Committees of county level or above elected their standing committees consisting of chairmen, vice chairmen and committee members. Committees of county level or above nominated working committees as their representative organ in township levels. The primary organization is the primary peasants' congress and the committee of association, or simply a group. The congress elected a chairman, 1-2 vice chairmen and several members for a committee, or a leader and 1-2 deputy leaders for a group. However, after 1964 the formal central organ may no longer be built.

Gertze worked in the household of Carl Hugo Hahn and his wife at Otjikango. She initially came to the school at the mission to learn sewing, and soon became so proficient that she was teaching the art to others. She appears to have been fluent in English, Dutch, and German, and she assisted in translating a variety of materials into Herero. Between 1860 and 1862 Hahn published nine Herero publications in Germany, and there is evidence that Gertze assisted considerably in ensuring their success. She traveled with Hahn and his wife to Germany, participating in mission work as a convert and working on the books on Herero. In 1862 she came back to Cape Town, and in 1864 she returned to Otjikango. The following year, she married the Herero-German Samuel Gertze. He was a widowed father of eight; the couple had nine more children in the ensuing fifteen years, ending with Samuel's death in 1880. Johanna worked as a midwife and pharmacist for the remainder of her life. She was featured on a Namibian postage stamp in 1999.  With the Hahn family  Uerita Kazahendike's mother was Herero and her father was Damara. By tribal custom, she was raised Herero. At 11 years old, she became the governess to the missionary Carl Hugo Hahn and his wife and children in Otjikango (later named Gross Barmen after the Rhenish Missionary Society's hometown). Hahn had founded the mission, west of Okahandja, on 31 October 1844. While looking after the Hahn children, she attended the mission school.  In the service of the Kreft family  In 1853, the Rev. Hahn took home leave in Germany, and Uerita accompanied his family to port in Cape Town. After seeing them off, she returned to South West Africa with the missionary Johannes Rath, but instead of returning to Otjikango, she stayed behind in Bethanie with the family of another Rhenish Missionary, Hermann Kreft, working as a servant and learning Dutch and some German. In 1936, the missionary and educator Heinrich Vedder wrote from Uerita's perspective of an incident that made a lasting impression on Uerita and probably contributed to her conversion: \\"It was little Mary's bedtime. After her bath, I went to her room to tuck her in. However, she was reluctant to get into bed and knelt before me, folding her hands together and asking me to pray with her as her mother did at bedtime. I did not know how to do so and it made me feel ashamed.\\" Uerita lived with the Kreft family in Namaland until 1857. Here she encountered a Christian congregation, an unusual sight in Hereroland, and attended catechism with a group of Nama. However, she still had no desire to be baptized and Kreft did not pressure her to change her mind.  Return to the Hahns  The Hahn family returned in 1857 to Hereroland and Uerita joined them once more in Otjimbingwe. On 25 July 1858, she was baptized on the mission as Johanna, the first Herero woman to join the Christian faith. She was indispensable in Hahn's efforts to translate stories from the Bible into Herero. Later, she accompanied the family to Germany to proofread books published in Herero out of Gütersloh. They stayed there in the mission home available to missionaries on home leave. Later, Vedder's mother made Johanna's acquaintance, making such an impression on her that she urged her son, born in 1876, to become a missionary to young people in Africa. Omaruru, and finally Otjimbingwe  In Germany  Johanna had a great task ahead of her in Germany. She managed the Hahn household along with participating in missionary work and proofreading prints from Bertelsmann of Hahn's written work in Herero. Along with a New Testament in Herero, Bertelsmann also published a grammar and a comprehensive dictionary. Unfortunately, Johanna struggled to adjust to life in Europe. \\"It is a beautiful land, but only if one is born there,\\" she later said. \\"If one is born in Africa, one should stay in Africa.\\"  Married life  In 1861, she returned to her homeland on the advice of her doctor, who believed the German climate was adversely affecting her health. Hugo Hahn, who would stay in Germany another two years, suggested that Johanna work for the household of Peter Heinrich Brinker, a young missionary in Otjikango. Samuel Gertze (born around 1805 in Kookfontein, died on 15 October 1889 in Otjimbingwe) lived in Otjikango at the time and had just become a widow with eight children. He married Johanna by the Herero custom, contributing the slaughter of two cattle and several goats for the wedding feast. The missionary dealer Johann Wilhelm Redecker, then a bachelor, was sent in 1868 to Omaruru to teach the locals to plant vegetable gardens and wheat fields. With her husband's permission, Johanna became Redecker's housekeeper while Gertze's adult daughters looked after their father. Once Redecker married, Johanna and Samuel moved to Anahout on the Swakop River where they supervised the Rhenish Missionaries' wheat fields. Johanna and Samuel had nine children, of whom two died in infancy. Samuel died of a ripe old age in 1889. Johanna was around 60 when she decided to become a midwife, and she helped bring many of Redecker's children into the world. She was highly proficient, to the point that she assisted with the pregnancies of many other European settler women.  Last years  On 25 July 1933, the Ojimbingwe Rhenish congregation celebrated a milestone with the 75th anniversary of Johanna's baptism. Though 97 and frail, she attended the event and regaled them with stories from the old days. \\"The Lord sure forgot to take me,\\" she quipped at the event. After her death a mere two years later at the age of almost 99, she was buried next to her husband in the Otjimbingwe cemetery. Their names are chiseled on a tombstone from which a cross appears. On July 25, 1933, the local Rhenish congregation celebrated the 75th anniversary of the first baptism among the Herero, Johanna Gertze  Legacy  In 1936, Vedder's book Die schwarze Johanna: Lebens- und Zeitbild der 99jährigen Johanna Gertze, der Erstlingsfrucht vom Missionsfelde des Hererolandes (\\"The Black Johanna: The Life and Times of 99-Year-Old Johanna Gertze, the First Fruits of the Mission in the Herero Lands\\") was published by the Rhenish Missionaries' press, Verlag des Missionshauses. In 1999, NamPost, the Namibian national postal service, issued a stamp honoring Gertze.

Early life and private career Knežević was born in Kragujevac, then part of the People's Republic of Serbia in the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. He graduated from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Medicine in 1977 and subsequently received a master's degree (1984) and a Ph.D. (1987) from the same institution.

Parliamentarian Knežević first entered the National Assembly following the 2008 Serbian parliamentary election, in which he received the thirty-seventh position on the electoral list of the Serbian Radical Party. The Radicals won seventy-eight seats, and Knežević was subsequently chosen as part of the party's delegation to the assembly.Избори за народне посланике Народне скупштине одржани 11. маја 2008. године, ИЗБОРНЕ ЛИСТЕ (СРПСКА РАДИКАЛНА СТРАНКА - Др ВОЈИСЛАВ ШЕШЕЉ) , Republika Srbija - Republička izborna komisija, accessed 17 February 2017. (From 2000 to 2011, Serbian parliamentary mandates were awarded to sponsoring parties or coalitions rather than to individual candidates, and it was common practice for mandates to be awarded out of numerical order. Knežević did not automatically receive a mandate by virtue of his position on the list, though he was selected for the party's delegation all the same.)Serbia's Law on the Election of Representatives (2000) stipulated that parliamentary mandates would be awarded to electoral lists (Article 80) that crossed the electoral threshold (Article 81), that mandates would be given to candidates appearing on the relevant lists (Article 83), and that the submitters of the lists were responsible for selecting their parliamentary delegations within ten days of the final results being published (Article 84).

Boris Tadić's For a European Serbia coalition formed government after the election, and the Radicals served in opposition. The Radical Party split in late 2008, and Knežević became part of a group of twenty-one parliamentarians that formed the breakaway Serbian Progressive Party under Tomislav Nikolić's leadership. Serbia's electoral system was reformed in 2011, such that parliamentary mandates were awarded in numerical order to candidates on successful lists. In the 2012 parliamentary election, Knežević received the fifty-fifth position on the Progressive Party's Let's Get Serbia Moving alliance list and was re-elected when the list won seventy- three mandates.Избори за народне посланике Народне скупштине, 6. мај 2012. године, ИЗБОРНЕ ЛИСТЕ (POKRENIMO SRBIJU - TOMISLAV NIKOLIĆ) , Republika Srbija - Republička izborna komisija, accessed 26 January 2017. The Progressive Party subsequently became the dominant party in a coalition government, and Knežević served as part of its parliamentary majority. He was re-elected in the elections of 2014 and 2016, both of which saw the Progressives their allies win majority victories.Knežević received the 115th position on the Progressive-led list in 2014 and the thirty-second position in 2016.

Opened on Rue Laffitte in 1863 by Alexandre Bernheim (1839-1915), friend of Delacroix, Corot and Courbet, it changed location a few times before settling on Avenue Matignon. It is still managed by members of the same family. The gallery promoted realists, Barbizon school paintings and, in 1874, the first impressionist and later post-impressionist painters. History In 1901, Alexandre Bernheim, with his sons, Josse (1870-1941), and Gaston (1870-1953), organized the first important exhibition of Vincent van Gogh paintings in Paris with the help of art critic Julien Leclercq.Oxford Index In 1906, Bernheim-Jeune frères started presenting works by Pierre Bonnard, Édouard Vuillard, Paul Cézanne, Henri-Edmond Cross, Kees van Dongen, Henri Matisse, Le Douanier Rousseau, Raoul Dufy, Maurice de Vlaminck, Amedeo Modigliani, Maurice Utrillo and Georges Dufrénoy. From 1906 to 1925, art critic Félix Fénéon was the director of the gallery and was instrumental in bringing in the art of Georges Seurat and Umberto Boccioni.Abc. Gallery.com The gallery became one of the centers of the artistic avant-garde. In 1906, the gallery also began publishing monographs; its first release was devoted to the paintings of Eugène Carrière. In 1919 it also launched a bimonthly bulletin about artistic life.

In 1941 their gallery was sequestered, paintings confiscated and their buildings sold. Like other art dealers such as Paul Rosenberg, Bernheim had to labor for several decades to recover some of the paintings, the task made more difficult as two record ledgers had disappeared from the gallery during the looting.Looted art.com In 1940 sensing that they, of Jewish background, would be targeted by the Nazis, the Bernheim-Jeune family had sent 30 or so impressionist and post- impressionist paintings to the Château de Rastignac in Dordogne for safekeeping.

As a two-year-old in 1990 he was one of the most successful colts of his generation in Europe, winning six of his eight races including the Coventry Stakes, Richmond Stakes and Phoenix Stakes. He failed to reproduce his juvenile form in two starts as a three-year-old and was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion. He had modest success as a sire of winners but was gelded in 1995 and died a year later. Background Mac's Imp was a bay horse with a white sock on his left hind leg bred in Kentucky by Brereton C Jones & Rodney P Carothers. As a yearling he was consigned by Jones to the Keeneland September Yearling Sale where he was bought for $25,000 by the British racehorse trainer Bill O'Gorman. During his racing career he was owned by Tamdown Ltd (Michael McDonnell and Tom Mohan) and trained by O'Gorman at Newmarket, Suffolk. O'Gorman had built his reputation by training precociously fast two-year-olds, including Superpower and the 1984 British Horse of the Year Provideo. Mac's Imp was ridden in all but one of his races by Alan Munro. He was sired by Imp Society, who won thirteen of his twenty-five races including the Oaklawn Handicap and Razorback Handicap. His dam Flaming Reason showed more modest racing ability, winning four minor events in a four-year track career. She was descended from Flaring Top (foaled 1947) an influential American broodmare who was the ancestor of many major winners including Nijinsky and The Minstrel. Racing career 1990: two-year-old season Mac's Imp made his racecourse debut in a maiden race over five furlongs at Nottingham Racecourse on 1 May in which he started the 4/9 favourite but finished second to Poet's Cove (later to win the Molecomb Stakes). He reappeared only four days later in a similar event at Newmarket and recorded his first success as he led from the start and won \\"comfortably\\" by five lengths. On 23 May he was moved up to six furlongs for a minor event at Goodwood Racecourse and won \\"easily\\" by eight lengths from three opponents. Three weeks later at Newbury he added a victory in the Kingsclere Stake, beating three opponents at odds of 4/6. Five days at his success at Newbury, Mac's Imp was moved up in class and started the 2/1 favourite against twelve opponents for the Group 3 Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot. He led from the start and kept on well in the final furlong to win by two lengths from Generous. In the following month at Newmarket, Mac's Imp started favourite for the July Stakes but after leading for most of the way he was overtaken approaching the final furlong and beaten into second place by Mujtahid. In the Richmond Stakes at Goodwood on 1 August the colt contested the Group 2 Richmond Stakes and started the 2/1 favourite ahead of six opponents including Time Gentleman (Railway Stakes) and Sylva Honda (Woodcote Stakes). After being briefly led by Mujadil, he went to the front after two furlongs and won by a length from Distinctly North, with three lengths back to Sylva Honda in third. Eleven days after his win at Goodwood, Macs Imp was sent to Ireland and faced Distinctly North again in the Group 1 Phoenix Stakes at Leopardstown Racecourse, where the other fancied runners included Capricciosa, On Tiptoes (Queen Mary Stakes) and Gypsy Fiddler (Windsor Castle Stakes). Starting the even money favourite, Mac's Imp prevailed by a neck from Distinctly North with a gap of three lengths back to the other eleven runners. 1991: three-year-old season Mac's Imp began his second campaign in a minor race over six furlongs at Thirsk Racecourse on 20 April. He started the 6/4 favourite but ran poorly and finished last of the eight runners, beaten almost twenty lengths by the winner Norton Challenger. Cash Asmussen took over from Munro when the colt was dropped to five furlongs for a race at Kempton in May. The change in jockey brought no improvement as Mac's Imp showed some \\"early speed\\" before fading to finish last of the six runners. Stud record Mac's Imp was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion. After three years he was removed from stud duties and was gelded in July 1995. He died a year later at the age of eight. During his brief stud career he sired many minor winners as well as a few better class performers including the Phoenix Sprint Stakes winner March Star.

It is a small country estate, best known for being the temporary residence of Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands when she first returned to the Netherlands near the end of the Second World War. Anneville lies in the municipality of Alphen-Chaam in southern Netherlands. History Anneville was founded by the famous Dutch archeologist and historian Prosper Cuypers van Velthoven, who built his country estate there in the neighborhood of Geersbroek south of Breda and just southeast of Ulvenhout. The estate was named for his wife, Anna van Velthoven. The land was originally a group of ten small farms, which were purchased by Velthoven over a few years, with the first purchase made in 1845. The properties were combined to form a suitable estate to surround a large country house. Cadastral records indicate a number of small houses and sheds had stood within the current park area. Construction on the house commenced in 1851 and was completed in 1852. The manor house was designed by architect Antoine Trappeniers. Some 40 years later in 1898 a coach house was added to the grounds, built by Prosper Cuypers' son, Edouard van Velthoven. After the marriage of his son Edourd in 1862, Prosper Cuypers and his wife moved out of the house and returned to Brussels. He continued his work on history there, while his son and his new wife moved in to the manor house at Anneville. For his career recording Belgium history he was awarded the Leopoldsorde in 1868. The house continued to be used as a residence for the Velthoven family until the 1920s. In the 1930s Anneville was rented out to the Bredase hotelier Coumans, who converted Anneville into a hotel, restaurant and tea house. The house lies in the woods of Ulvenhout. A row of beeches line the approach to the estate. Its driveway curves around a lawn where stone steps rise to a small portico. In the back high glass doors open on to a veranda that looks out over gardens and the Brabant countryside. Two ponds are surrounded by wide lawns, tall trees, walking paths and clusters of flowering rhododendrons. During the German occupation in World War II the estate was requisitioned by the Germans. About 1.5 hectares (roughly 4 acres) of the surrounding woods were harvested, and outdoor ovens were set up on the grounds around the coach house. These were used to bake bread. After the region was liberated in October 1944 the mayor of Ulvenhout claimed the house for Prince Bernhard, who was the acting commander of the Netherlands resistance forces. He took residence there 19 November 1944 while he set up his headquarters in nearby Breda. He occupied the estate until May 1945, when he vacated the premises for Queen Wilhelmina. Queen Wilhelmina arrived at Anneville on 2 May 1945. With her was her daughter Princess Juliana, and adjuncts Peter Tazelaar, Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema and Rie Stokvis. The three adjuncts were not from the royal household, but all three had been Engelandvaarders. Their presence was a part of the queen's effort to decrease the barrier between the royal family and the people. Though Anneville was a serene and stately manor house, it was a far cry from the palace at Het Loo, and symbolized a formal break from the highly formalistic and class conscious existence the royal family had been confined to before the war. While the queen was in residence the ground floor of the coach house served as a motor garage, while the rooms above the garage housed the small guard detail. Anneville was the scene of a number of spontaneous gatherings of the people of the Netherlands. When the people of Breda and the surrounding communities learned the queen was present they gathered there to greet here, and a spontaneous procession filed past the house to greet their queen. Soon after the queen's arrival she learned from Peter Tazelaar that Germany had surrendered. It was a time of great joy in the Netherlands. In late June the queen's stay at Anneville concluded. On 20 June 1945 a party was held by the royal family as a thanks to the local people. The queen's stay at Anneville had lasted for a little over 6 weeks. During this brief period of time Anneville had become the centre of the Netherlands. She confided later that her time at Anneville was the happiest period of her reign. She reportedly told Hazelhoff at their last meeting \\"Anneville... Dat was onze sprookjestijd.\\" (Anneville ... That was our fairy-tale time.) After the Queen vacated the building it was put back into use as a hotel, restaurant and tea shop. It remained so from 1946 until 1955, and was used for staff meetings, business courses and conferences. A number of the Benelux treaties were signed at Anneville in the first half of the 1950s. After that, it was rented in succession by Thomsen's United Port Authority in Rotterdam and the Outward Bound School Netherlands. In 1992, the house was renovated and rented out for use as an office and residence. In 1998 the coach house was restored and renovated to make a conference and wedding hall, the \\"Koetshuis Anneville\\". The main house is still being used as a residence for the owner, whose family run the operation of the \\"Koetshuis Anneville\\" meeting place.

In 2012, she successfully auditioned for a presenting role on the ITV television series, Love Your Garden as a co-presenter alongside Alan Titchmarsh, David Domoney and Frances Tophill. She has also been commissioned as a garden designer for many attractions and centres in Northern England, such as Airedale Hospital. Biography Rushworth was born in Leeds and received her secondary education at Agnes Stewart High School in Burmantofts, before taking a part-time job in the fashion industry and then working full-time for Harvey Nicholls in Leeds. After having her daughter, she decided upon a career change as she was travelling around with her job and it was not conducive to raising a child. A friend asked Rushworth to help out with a bit of gardening and Rushworth found she really enjoyed it; so much so, that she enrolled on a horticultural course at Shipley College (the same college that her future co-presenter Alan Titchmarsh attended). Whilst she was on the course at Shipley College, she decided to go into garden design, which meant transferring to a degree course at Craven College (delivered by Bradford University). It was whilst she was at Craven College that a friend mentioned an e-mail asking for people to audition for Love Your Garden. She was among 90 people who applied for the role and the producers settled on Rushworth after interviews and a callback process. In 2013, Rushworth was asked to turn on the lights at Bingley's Christmas festival (she was living in the town at the time) and in 2016, Rushworth released a book entitled Plants, Beds and Borders; Create and Maintain your Perfect Garden. In 2017, Rushworth teamed up with a garden centre in Tong to create a \\"people's garden\\" and became the designer for a garden outside the children's ward at Airedale Hospital in Steeton, West Yorkshire. Personal life In 2008, Rushworth gave birth to a daughter at Airedale Hospital. Rushworth was born and brought up in Leeds, but whilst she was studying horticulture, she lived in Bingley, West Yorkshire.

It was founded on 10 April 1893 and its registered office was at Mona Street in Beeston near Nottingham. Originally, the company name was 'The Beeston Foundry Company Limited' but in 1923 the company changed its name to 'The Beeston Boiler Company Limited'. In 1943 it became a public company, and by 1961 was employing 850 people, and was at that time advertising itself as makers of cast iron boilers, garage and greenhouse boilers, hot water pipes, connections and cast iron valves. The company was founded in 1893 by Henry John Pearson (1850-1913), in conjunction with his elder brother, Louis Frederick Pearson (1863-1943). Henry became the company's first chairman, followed by Louis after Henry's death. Louis Pearson then took on an important role during WWI when the company assisted with the production of munitions, eventually earning him a CBE. The company occupied a 28 acre site adjacent to the Midland Railway Company's line in Beeston, which it first occupied in 1896, and which became known to local people simply as 'The Foundry'. In 1910 the company became engaged in some form of legal action against the Midland Railway Company, with detailed records of the litigation eventually deposited in The National Archives. The company ran into financial difficulties during the 1970s and became insolvent; an administrative receiver was appointed in 1976.  Robin Hood boiler  The Robin Hood range of boilers was introduced around the start of the 20th century, with adverts appearing in The Times as early as 1912, both for the boiler and 'Beeston radiators'. In the 1930s, two Robin Hood boilers were installed to provide horticultural heating in the large gardens at Calke Abbey in the 1930s. One of them, a New C Pattern model, was introduced by the company in August 1930. At Calke its six sections fed three circuits, providing heat to the mushroom house, the vinery, and the cucumber houses. The boiler remains on public view in what is now a National Trust property.

It was based on the 1944 Broadway play of the same name by Norman Krasna. A teenage girl has a soldier for a pen pal, but uses her older sister's name and photograph. Then the man shows up while on a two-day leave. There were two sequels: Dear Wife (1949), with all of the principal actors reprising their roles, and Dear Brat (1951), featuring Freeman, Arnold and De Wolfe. Although it is sometimes mistakenly believed that J. D. Salinger got the name for his character Holden Caulfield, in The Catcher in the Rye and other works, when he saw a marquee for the film, the first Holden Caulfield story, \\"I'm Crazy\\", was published in December 1945, a year and a half before the movie's release. Plot Judge Wilkins and his wife Edie are puzzled when Lieutenant William Seacroft, a complete stranger, shows up at their home, asking for their elder, 22-year-old daughter Ruth. (She has gone to work at the bank, driven by her 34-year-old boyfriend Albert.) Bill has just returned from Italy, where he flew 25 missions over Germany as the bombardier of a B-26 bomber, but he only has a two-day leave. He explains that he has been corresponding with their daughter and has fallen in love with her long-distance. He makes a favorable impression on Ruth's parents and promises to return at 5:30 to meet her for the first time in person. Ruth comes home and tells her parents she is getting married. They assume she has encountered Bill, but it turns out she is marrying Albert. They soon find out that their energetic 16-year-old daughter Miriam wrote to Bill 60 times, using her sister's name and sending him a photograph of Ruth, just one of her many contributions to the war effort and servicemen's morale. Ruth decides to tell Bill the truth immediately, but when he arrives, she cannot bring herself to do so. When Albert shows up for a date with Ruth, she slips away with Bill so that she can tell him privately, not in front of her entire family. Bill takes her to a play, dinner and dancing until past 1 am. Albert and Ruth's parents wait up. Later, Ruth tells Albert that after Bill leaves for the Pacific, she will write to him and gently break off their relationship. She then gets the letters from Miriam and starts reading them. The next morning, Bill's kid sister Martha waits for him in front of the Wilkins home. When Bill arrives, Ruth insists on taking Martha with them, supposedly because she has not seen her brother in two years, but actually to try to keep Bill's amorous behavior in check, so Bill invites a secretly fuming Albert too. Bill takes every opportunity to kiss Ruth, infuriating Albert. Then somebody pushes Albert off a crowded subway car at a station, and he gets separated from the others. He races to another station on the same line, but gets arrested for trying to get in without paying. A further romantic complication ensues when both Martha and Sergeant Chuck Vincent, Bill's friend, arrive at the Wilkins residence. Martha broke up with Chuck very recently. Lunch is therefore very awkward. Then Bill and Ruth show up and announce they are engaged. When Bill leaves the room, Ruth tells Albert that it is only for a few more hours. However, Bill receives a telephone call informing him that he and Chuck will be instructors in Florida. Chuck and Martha reconcile and decide to get married themselves. Judge Wilkins conducts the ceremony. Ruth then tells Bill that she only agreed to marry him because he was going back into combat, but nothing more. Miriam inadvertently reveals the whole truth to Bill. Bill accepts the situation, but after Martha and Chuck get married, Ruth has a change of heart. She and Bill also get married by her father, before leaving for Florida. Then a sailor appears, asking for Ruth. Startled, Miriam blurts out his name.

Columbia was unsuccessful, appealed the decision and lost the appeal. Reception Critical Bosley Crowther praised the film in The New York Times, calling it \\"one of those simon-pure excursions in fun, which bubbles and sparkles its way into your heart and completely disarms any resistance which an unadorned outline of its conventional plot might invoke\\" and noting that \\"the pace never drags, even though the slim story is stretched out over ninety minutes.\\" Box office The film was successful at the box office. It earned almost $4 million during the films first year of release in North America, and led to two sequels. Sequels Paramount purchased the rights to use the characters again.

Three Israeli security guards were killed and a fourth was injured. The gunman was shot dead by the remaining guards. The Israeli authorities described the attack as an 'act of terrorism'.  Background  Har Adar was initially built adjacent to the Green Line but has grown past it since the 1967 Six-Day War and is now largely located within the West Bank. Two hundred Palestinian workers enter the town through the gate where the attack took place daily. Around 100,000 Palestinians hold permits that allow them to work in Israel and within Israeli settlements, mostly as manual laborers. Attack The attack took place as the gunman approached an entrance to Har Adar guarded by a border policeman and two civilian security guards. Border policeman Solomon Gavriyah (20) of Be'er Ya'akov, was killed, as were civilian security guards Youssef Ottman (25) of Abu Ghosh and Or Arish (25) of Har Adar. A fourth man, the head civilian security officer of Har Adar, was injured. The attacker was shot and killed. Sgt. Solomon Gavriyah was killed in the attack Prior to the attack two Machsom Watch activists approached the checkpoint, upon which Gavriyah left the checkpoint and requested they step away. Police reported that one of the activists told Ethiopian-Israeli Gavriyah \\"You are a disgrace\\", which the activist later denied.

He held a license to work in Israeli settlements. An initial inquiry into the attack uncovered Jamal suffered from severe personal and family issues, including domestic violence. It was reported that he physically assaulted his wife, and as a result, she fled to Jordan several weeks ago, leaving him with the children. Minutes before carrying out the attack, Jamal sent his wife a message on Facebook Messenger, apologizing for what he was about to do, mourned her departure and said he had been a terrible husband to her.

Biography  Bediako was born in Akropong, Ghana and, as the son of a police inspector, grew up in a Police Training Depot in Accra. Due to this upbringing, he learned and spoke his mother tongue of Twi and the Accra language Ga. Bediako was raised in a Christian home, the grandson of a Presbyterian catechist and evangelist, and received his secondary education in the Mfantsi-pim School, Cape Coast, originally founded as part of a British Methodist mission. However, he would later become an atheist through French existentialist influences and pursue masters and doctoral degrees in the University of Bordeaux on African francophone literature. Yet during his time in France, he experienced a radical conversion event back to Christianity. In 1973, he would marry a fellow student of French, from England, Gillian Mary. Later, he would move on to a second doctorate in 1983 in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Aberdeen, under Andrew Walls. Bediako would later become the first rector of the Akrofi-Christaller Institute for Theology, Mission and Culture, a university dedicated to the study and the documentation of Christian history, thought, and life in Ghana and, more broadly, in Africa. An endowment fund has been established in the Institute under his name. Kwame Bediako died on June 10, 2008 following a serious illness.  Theology  In his latter life, Bediako was known primarily for his works in African Christian theology. His PhD at Aberdeen would be later published in 1999, which explored the influence of indigenous cultures on Christianity in the second century Greco-Roman world and in 20th century Africa. His other works have tended to emphasize questions related to the encounter between Christianity and an indigenous religious context, especially as found in Africa. Furthermore, mindful of his linguistic background, Bediako was an advocate for the role of vernacular language on the development of Christian theology.

H. Steinberg ed., A New Dictionary of British History (London 1963) p. 211 Protests against the Maltolt played their part in forcing the confirmation of the charters from the Crown. Origin Edward I of England had been granted a half-mark (6s 8d) customs duty per sack on the export of wool by the Parliament of 1275.J. R. Tanner ed., The Cambridge Medieval history Vol VII (Cambridge 1932) p. 404 War with France in 1294 led to the royal seizure of all wool and leather in the realm, and its release only on a duty of 40s per sack. The old duty quickly became known as the \\"Ancient Custom\\", and was contrasted strongly with what G. M. Trevelyan would call \\"These 'maltoltes' or 'ill takings' of wool\\".G. M. Trevelyan, History of England (London 1926) p. 197 Protests Dislike of the Maltolts (which had been repeated in the years 1295-1297) fed into the noble and clerical opposition to the Crown that culminated in the Monstraunces of 1297. As the latter maintained, \\"Also the whole community feel that they are oppressed by the tax on wools, which is too heavy, namely at 40 shillings on the sack, and 7 marks the sack on broken wool; for the wool of England approaches the value of half of all the land\\".Roger Wickson, The Community of the Realm in 13TH C England (London 1970) p. 112 Among the six articles appended to the confirmation of the charters was, accordingly, a provision prohibiting the seizure of wool in future; to which the king responded by reserving to the crown “the custom on wool, skins and leather already granted by the commonalty of the realm”, so that it was only after a further struggle that the maltolt was finally laid to rest in 1301.J. R. Tanner ed., The Cambridge Medieval history Vol VII (Cambridge 1932) p. 409-10 Reappearance The maltolt reappeared in the reign of Edward III of England, as a result of a bargain he made in 1337 offering rich merchants a monopoly in exchange for a duty of 40s a sack.R. G. Davies, The English Parliament in the Middle Ages (1981) p. 43 The Commons petitioned against the deal, either (as Eileen Power thought) in the hope of abolishing it entirely, or simply to ensure their participation in the taxation process - something which they eventually achieved, if at the price of customs on wool continuing to fund the Crown throughout the Hundred Years War.C.

Taylor from South Carolina. A third house next door, also designed by Taylor, is also part of this small collection of International Style houses. The first house, The Sunset House, built in 1957, was demolished in 2013, while the second house, the Hodgkins and Skubic House, built in 1967, is still standing. The houses, with a third one built next door, were featured in the book Santa Barbara Architecture, from Spanish Colonial to Modern which was published in 1975; of the surviving house, the book says: \\"A simple and effective statement using common materials of redwood, block, and glass in its construction.\\" Another book was published in 1977 coauthored by David Gebhard, a professor and architectural historian. The book was a guide to architecture in Los Angeles and Southern California, and in the book, the three houses built in Del Playa by Richard Taylor were described as \\"the only objects of note\\" architecturally in the area. The third house is the Sweeney and Lee House (1968).

She received a Doctorate degree in Education from Columbia University. In the late 1930s Hodgkins was teacher of Physical Education at Horace Mann School, Teachers College Schools, and Columbia University. In 1938 she was an instructor at University of California, Los Angeles. During World War II Hodgkins served as a Lt. Comdr. in the U.S. Navy. In 1946 Hodgkins became professor of ergonomics and Skubic of physical education, both of them at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In the 1960s they co-wrote articles on health and physical education such as Relative Strenuousness of Selected Sports as Performed by Women, Anticipatory, exercise, and recovery heart rates of girls as affected by four running events and Cardiac Response to Participation in Selected Individual and Dual Sports as Determined by Telemetry. In the 1970s Skubic taught an Ergonomics course for children with hearing disabilities. According to an article published by the Daily Nexus in 2003, \\"both played major roles in the development of women’s athletics and ability to participate in recreational activities on American campuses during the 1970s. Prior to their arrival, the words “female” and “athlete” were not mentioned in the same sentence.\\" Richard B. Taylor The Sweeney and Lee House Richard B. Taylor (1926-1993) received a BS and BA in architecture and landscape architecture from the University of Virginia in 1948. He studied at the Fontainebleau Schools in France. He practiced in South Carolina and taught at University of Georgia before moving to the West Coast. He was a lecturer at University of California, Berkeley. In 1956 he moved to Santa Barbara and for the next 36 years he worked in the Tri-County area.

For the next twelve years he would spend the winters in Fort Cochin, Kerala. Link to 'Anthony Fry, New Work Inspired By India' Exhibition Press Release, 2006 In an essay entitled 'A Certain Tradition of Heat', John Berger wrote: \\"Fry's pictures – like all good visual art – defy words. With words we cannot get nearer to them than a map can get to a landscape. We can enter them only with our eyes. Once within them, the eyes may tell the skin something. Once within, the eyes may see even with the eyelids shut.\\"Page IX: 'Anthony Fry', Published by Umbrage Editions, Inc 2001 Fry was interviewed extensively about his life by Cathy Courtney for the Artists Lives series for the British Library 'National Life Story Collection'.

Begun by Emmy and Eberhard Arnold and a handful of others in 1920, its members sought a lifestyle that would offer an alternative to the bitterness and despair that ravaged Europe in the wake of World War I. They took the words of Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount as a directive on which to build their community: peacemaking, purity in relationships, love to one another and to enemies. Arnold wrote articles, published a periodical, and was a popular speaker in tune with the currents of the time. When Adolf Hitler seized control of Germany at the beginning of 1933, he was immediately concerned, recognising that his own Christian philosophy was on a collision course with Hitler’s worldview. Rather than flee the country, however, Arnold believed that the Bruderhof had a missionary task. He wrote personal letters to Hitler, Hindenburg, and other high-ranking officials, in which he appealed to them to protect innocent lives. He warned his community to prepare for persecution. At the end of 1933, the community’s license to run a private elementary school was revoked. Unwilling to submit their children to Nazi influence, they took them to the independent principality of Liechtenstein, where they established a daughter community. A year later, when compulsive military conscription was introduced in Germany, the Bruderhof’s young men similarly escaped to Liechtenstein. In 1936 a third community was begun in the UK, the Cotswold Bruderhof. Eberhard Arnold died unexpectedly at the end of 1935 as a result of complications of a broken leg. The Rhön Bruderhof struggled to remain viable: Establishing new Bruderhofs in Liechtenstein and the United Kingdom demanded money that they did not have, while in Germany the manpower needed to maintain the agricultural projects was lacking. In addition, they were no longer permitted to sell their produce in Germany. Twice they were searched and interrogated by the Gestapo. On April 14, 1937, the German compound was surrounded by stormtroopers, Gestapo and local police. Bruderhof members were herded into the dining hall, where the Gestapo read out a decree dissolving the incorporated society and ordering its members to return to their former homes. The property, including the cash and the members’ passports, was confiscated. Rooms were searched, and books and papers were hauled off. The three men who made up the Executive Committee were arrested. Two visitors from the Hutterian Brethren in America happened to be present, and when the police entered their room they protested and boldly announced that they would report this event on their return home. The Gestapo had not expected this, and it is likely that their presence saved the lives of Bruderhof members, who were allowed to leave the country safely. Some travelled to Liechtenstein, and others to the UK (via the Netherlands, where they received help from the Mennonite community). One woman, the accountant, remained behind under house arrest to close the books. The Executive Committee, Hans Meier, Hans Boller, and Karl Keiderling, were held in prison for three months. During that time, the initial charge of a threat to the state was changed to fraud – a move that cleared the Nazis of any accusation of persecuting Christians. The Bruderhof still exists in North and South America, the UK, Austria, Australia, and once again in Germany. They still believe in pacifism, community of goods and communal work.

The tax would have doubled the level of taxation on the (according to Simeon) poor Christian community of the Sasanian Empire, who were sympathetic to the recently Christianized Roman Empire.

Born in Feuchtwangen, Vogel was later a clerk, court director, and councillor in Köstritz. In 1792 he moved to Jena, taking a position as treasurer (Kreiskassierer) for the local area. In August 1793 he became the Second Mayor (zweiter Bürgermeister) and in June 1805 First Mayor (erster Bürgermeister). At the time of the Battle of Jena–Auerstedt in 1806, Napoleon Bonaparte stayed in his house in the Jena Marktplatz. In July 1806, he was returned to being Second Mayor but from August 1807 until September 1808 was once again First Mayor, and remained a mayor until 1809. During his term in office, he continued to server as treasurer for the area. In 1801 he became a member of the Chamber Council (Kammerrat). He was only one of the mayors of the city at this time. A contemporary figure also serving as mayor, who was somewhat more important than Vogel with better diplomatic skills and connections, was the merchant and court representative of Saxony-Weimar, Johann Christoph Jacob Paulsen (1768-1808). He was mayor from 1789 to 1808 and exchanged the position of First and Second Mayor with Vogel several times.Katja Deinhardt, Stapelstadt des Wissens, 2007, pp. 381 with table of mayors. Vogel was later criticized for the time as mayor in 1806 during the battle, being described as sickly, hesitant and indecisive. At that point, Paulsen was already incapacitated with illness. Vogel was engaged in social issues in Jena and established a poorhouse, whose residents later received work through his son's cloth factory. He received heavy criticism for the heavy-handed manner in which he ran the poorhouse, but was still the only one then tackling this issue. When he retired from the city council and politics in 1810, in part because of conflicts with the city's police commissioner, he remained director of the hospital, workhouse and asylum. He died in 1813 in Jena. Goethe, Wieland, Starke and Vogel as Knights of the Legion of Honour (12 October 1808) On 12 October 1808, for his service in the care of the wounded after the Battle of Jena, he was named to the Legion of Honour (at the same time as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Christoph Martin Wieland and Johann Christian Stark).

Flag of the International Brigades. The 86th Mixed Brigade (), was a mixed brigade of the Spanish Republican Army in the Spanish Civil War. It was formed in March 1937 with battalions of the Carabineros corps. Until its demise it operated mostly in the Sierra Morena area, at the southern limits of the territory held by the Republic. In January 1938 it was deeply restructured and transformed into an International Brigade having 2,338 international fighters which lasted until 1 October the same year.Carlos Engel, Historia de las Brigadas Mixtas del E. P. de la República, 1999; p. 114 History First phase A unit known as Brigada Móvil de Puertollano was established towards the end of 1936 led by Infantry Lieutenant Colonel Ernesto Martín del Castillo. It was organized with two Carabineros battalions from Requena and Castellón, the 'Pablo Iglesias nr 2 Battalion' from Valencia and another Carabineros battalion that joined the unit in Linares. In March 1937 this military unit became the 86th Mixed Brigade (86.ª Brigada Mixta) and one of its Carabineros battalions was replaced by the 20th International Battalion (20.º Batallón Internacional). The newly-formed battalion had four companies: the First (1ª compañía) was French; the Second (2ª compañía) or Anglo-American Company was English- speaking with a Latin-American, an American and a British and Irish section; the Third (3ª compañía) included Czechoslovak and Polish volunteers; and the Fourth (4ª compañía de ametralladoras) was made up of Germans and Austrians. Las Brigadas Internacionales en Andalucía - Comisión histórica de la AABIFull text of \\"International Solidarity with the Spanish Republic (1936-1939)\\" The leader of the new unit was Italian Militia Major Aldo Morandi, who was replaced as head of the 20th International Battalion by Mexican Colonel Juan Bautista Gómez, with German Major Fritz Schiller as Chief of Staff. The reorganized brigade became part of the 24th Division of the Spanish Republican Army. On 10 March the brigade performed poorly in combats around Sierra Mulva. Between 27 March and 13 April it took part in military operations over Peñarroya-Pueblonuevo, attacking Pozoblanco in the left flank of the campaign.Ramón Salas Larrazábal (2006); Historia del Ejército Popular de la República, pp. 1402-1404 On 22 August the brigade was badly shattered at Puerto de San Vicente. Between 18 and 20 October it took part in the defense of the Sierra de la Noria. In December it was made part of the 63rd Division of the 8th Army Corps and again it suffered a lot of casualties during the attack against Granja de Torrehermosa, so that it was relieved of its duties and sent to Villanueva de Córdoba in order to be reorganized. At this time there were numerous desertions among the remaining members of the wrecked brigade. International Brigade period In January 1938, as a result of heavy restructuring, the 20th International Battalion was split into three battalions, the 20th, 21st and 22nd. At the same time three of the Carabineros battalions were transferred to the 222nd Mixed Brigade so that the only remaining Spanish battalion was the 'Pablo Iglesias nr 2 Battalion'. Thus the 86th Mixed Brigade became one more International Brigade, with 2,338 international fighters of which 57 were leaders and officers and 29 were sub- officers. The newly-formed battalions were led by Militia Majors Ernst Düdel, Paul Odpadlik, Cuni Bernhardt and Adolf Rach, while the machine gun company was led by Georg Prunzings. The restructured brigade returned to the front line at the Sierra del Castaño and the Peña del Águila, replacing the 103rd Mixed Brigade. It saw action during the attack against the rebel positions at Villafranca de Córdoba covering the front in the Guadalmellato and Miradero positions. However, in order to satisfy the demands of the Non-Intervention Committee, the foreign members of the brigade were withdrawn on 1 October 1938 and were replaced by battalions of Spanish conscripts. Being composed of local soldiers, thenceforward the 86th Mixed Brigade was wrapped up as an International Brigade.Carlos Engel, Historia de las Brigadas Mixtas del E. P. de la República, 1999; p. 115 End of the unit In its last phase the 86th Mixed Brigade was initially led by Militia Major Lino Carrasco Ortiz, who was replaced by Militia Major Ramón Lleida Gómez after only a month. The unit saw little action in the intervening months until the final defeat and surrender of the Spanish Republic in March 1939.

Cantonese merchants (Cantonese Jyutping: Jyut6 soeng1; Traditional Chinese: 粵商) refers to merchants of Cantonese origins, thought sometimes it is used to include Hakka and Teochew merchants who originated from the Southern Chinese province of Gwongdung - where Cantonese people have been the dominant demographic. Historically, the Cantonese people have spent most of the second millennium AD being one of the main ports of successive Chinese dynasties, resulting in the formation of a distinct business culture which many cultural studies and business scholars have sought to examine.Cheng, Y. H., & Huang, P. Y. (2008). A Review of the Research on the Culture of Cantonese Merchants [J]. Journal of Guangdong University of Business Studies, 3, 013.Burgess, J. S. (1909). A Study of the Characteristics of the Cantonese Merchants in Chinatown, New York, as Shown by Their Use of Leisure Time. Columbia University. Culture of the Cantonese merchants Located in the southern fringe of China, far away from center of power, adjacent to Hong Kong and Macau, Cantonese merchants were the first to open up the market to Western European commerce and to accept economic and cultural exchange with Southeast Asia. As a result, a unique business culture emerged. According to scholars, the main characteristics of Cantonese merchants include:黄华. (2007). “粤商” 企业文化创新研究. 广东商学院学报, (3), 24-27.刘昱. (2006). 广东区域经济的发展: 基于创业型经济的分析. 暨南学报 (哲学社会科学版), 28(6), 69-72.彭澎, & 张菊梅. (2007). 新粤商的特征变化及其更换模式研究. 珠江经济, (11), 70-74. *Strong market sensitivity: Cantonese merchants are quick to discover new business opportunities. They are decisive and bold while others are hesitant. This is considered one of the reasons why Cantonese businessmen, among Han Chinese business people, are usually among the first to adopt advanced technology in doing their businesses. *Acceptance and inclusiveness: Cantonese merchants are open to a variety of capable people and new techniques. It has been pointed out that they are generally able to learn with open minds and are conducive to criticism and young talents. Scholars have also suggested that this is why many successful Cantonese merchants are of lower-class origins. *Pragmatism and robustness: Cantonese merchants do not make rash decisions. They do things step-by-step, believing that \\"only money actually in one's hand can be considered 'earned'\\". They avoid take risk unless they have thoroughly studied it. Their pragmatism prevents them from using garish means to do promotion. For instance, when Zhengzhou Asia tried to open department stores near Gwongzau, they attempted to use drum bands to welcome their customers every morning, but Cantonese businessmen did not see the meaning of it and none of them adopt the practice. *Belief in hard work: Most Cantonese business started from small business - such as hawkers - and tend to maintain a belief in hard work even when they have become big and successful. Among Cantonese merchants, it is quite common to see the boss running the stores personally while the staff rest, or the boss cleaning the stores by him/herself.

He is mainly known for his large-scale projects in connection with water and rivers in particular. His work was awarded the Green Prize of the Upper Austria and the Ford Environment Prize of the Austrian Federal Ministry of Forestry, Environment and Water Resources. He is married and has a daughter.  Early life  Joachim Eckl grew up on the river Große Mühl. His ancestors were all millers; his great-grandfather erected in 1902 the first hydroelectric power plant on the Große Mühl river, which still stands and operates to this day. Joachim Eckl's views on the art and culture are therefore strongly influenced by the close connection of the humanity with the mysticism of the water. He finalized his psychology studies in New York and started to produce and create projects under his own name, but also under the moniker \\"heim.art\\". Although his main focus are the rivers in Upper Austria, where he resides, he conducted art installations related to the rivers Nile, Rhone, Jordan and others as well. He currently resides and operates offices in Neufelden and Linz, Austria. His latest project at heim.art includes hosting the Wandelweiser Composers Meet Composers Mentoring Project including fellow Wandelweiser composers/artists Antoine Beuger, Emmanuelle Waeckerle, Marianne Schuppe, and Jürg Frey.  Art projects, works and collaborations  Joachim Eckl, water drawing. Joachim Eckl's first major production was a collaboration with Vito Acconci for the Werkstatt Kollerschlag, the installation Multi-Bed 2 in 1991. Further collaborations with other artists followed, like the exhibition \\"The Only One\\" with Georg Lindorfer, then exhibitions and collaborations with Tony Cragg, Jeff Koons and Christo and Jeanne-Claude followed. In 1997, together with the German artist Klaus Rinke, Joachim Eckl started a series of collaborations, with the most prominent opus being the design of the Pro Kaufland Shopping Mall in Linz. In the 21. Century Eckl returned to his artistic roots and developed the water drawing performance – art installation, but also an intellectual and spiritual experience – named \\"Persönliche Schöpfung\\", a play on words in German, meaning personal creation and personal drawing at the same time. He organized 348 people to perform the water drawing and nightly sleepovers in the river bed of the Große Mühl, in order to raise awareness to the horrible state the river was in at the time in 2003. The federal government reacted and a new form of environmental protest was born. Eckl developed out of this success the \\"River to River\\" project, which led him to Cairo, Egypt and the 11th International Cairo Biennial. In Egypt he built an ice pyramid and ice sculptures of people in the Faiyum desert, photographs of which years later were used in the Kunst Im Bau exhibition 6 : 9 Weltversprechen, 13. January 2017 in Munich, Germany. In July 2017 the exhibition \\"Bleaching Time\\" for the Textile Center of Haslach and in September 2017 \\"River Talks\\" in the Chapel on OK-Platz in Linz took place.  Clean Water – Reines Wasser in Lentos Art Museum Linz  From 3 October 2014 to 15 February 2015 a 60-day creative water drawing activity took place under the name \\"Donau-Körper\\" that became an art installation named \\"Pure Water\\". The Lentos Art Museum in Linz helped to organize this project by Joachim Eckl, with a total of 60 teams each drawing 1,000 liters of water from the Danube, which were combined in containers, in order to create a unique sculpture that would display the amount of water that flows through the human body during the whole average human life span. The whole experience was recorded and can be viewed on the heim.art YouTube channel.  Hotel and Restaurant Mühltalhof  Joachim Eckl has created the permanent art installation \\"Landing spot for arrivals\\" at the entrance of the hotel and restaurant Mühltalhof, which is located on the banks of the Grosse Mühl and is known for the \\"Mühlviertler\\" natural kitchen on the haute cuisine level. Johanna Eckl, born Rachinger, the wife of Joachim Eckl, is the owner of this establishment together with her brother, Helmut Rachinger. The central point of this installation is a 350-million-year-old stone, a granite glacial erratic.

Biography  Born in Lunéville of a military father, captain and then colonel in the artillery, Marie Bobillier, a single daughter, lived her childhood in several cities, including Strasbourg and Metz, before finally settling in Paris in 1871. She learned to play the piano, but a scarlet fever contracted at the age of thirteen rendered her disabled, influencing her decision to devote her life to research, after having been to the Pasdeloup concerts. She was one of the first French women musicologists. Her first publication, Histoire de la symphonie à orchestreHistoire de la symphonie à orchestre on Gallica, under the name Brenet (1882), won a prize in Brussels (Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium), engaging her ever-increasing reputation in the French musicological world. With a rigorous method that drew on the most reliable sources and documents, she made a series of publications - several valuable studies devoted to vocal music by Ockeghem, Goudimel, Palestrina (1906), Sébastien de Brossard, Haendel, Haydn, Grétry and Berlioz. Bobillier also approached classical and medieval instrumental music and left a precious and independent Dictionnaire pratique et historique de la musique,Dictionnaire pratique et historique de la musique on Gallica under the name Brenet completed and published by Amédée Gastoué in 1926. Her book Notes sur l’histoire du luth en FranceNotes sur l’histoire du luth en France on WorldCat, under the name Brenet paved the way for further research in this area.

History In 1958 HFB proposed to the German Government two new transports, the HFB 209 turboprop and the HFB 314 short-range jet transport. The 314 would be a direct competitor to the French Sud Aviation Caravelle, then already under development. Although the German government was initially willing to negotiate over financing the projects, in the end they decided that the German aircraft industry should not develop its own designs but should instead collaborate with other countries. Finance was never made available and HFB could not progress without it. With the competing Boeing 727 and de Havilland DH.121 Trident both also advancing steadily, HFB abandoned the project in 1960.Flight, 18 November 1960, p. 805.Flight, 16 December 1960, p. 961.\\"Hamburger Flugzeugbau\\", Flight, 19 October 1961, pp.619-20\\"Pas de Caravelle Allemande\\", Les Ailes, No. 1,804, 16 Décember 1960. Design The HFB 314 was a conventional swept-wing monoplane intended as a 70-78 seat short-to-medium range jet airliner. The upper fuselage accommodated the crew cockpit and passenger cabin, while the lower half correspondingly housed the nosewheel and cargo bays. The tail was of T type, with the tailplanes attached on either side of an anti-shock fairing on top of the fin. The fairing delayed the onset of shockwaves and accompanying drag increase at high cruising speeds. The relatively sharply swept wing was mounted low on the fuselage, with the carry-through structure passing between the cargo holds. The inner wing sections were more sharply swept and tapered, and housed the main undercarriage mechanism which retracted inwards so that the wheels lay in the fuselage. Two Rolls-Royce RB 141/11 turbojets were fitted in blisters protruding from either side of the rear fuselage, with alternatives offered including the General Electric CJ-805-23 or Pratt & Whitney JT3D-3.

Animation: A World History: Volume I: Foundations - The Golden Age at Google Books, p. 76—78 Early years Nikolai Khodataev was born in the Konstantinovskaya stanitsa (modern-day Konstantinovsk, Rostov Oblast of Russia) where his father Peter Petrovich Khodataev served at the time. His paternal grandmother Agafia Kondratievna Khodataeva, a lonely Russian woman, was seduced by a merchant from the Vladimir Governorate and taken away from her native town. He left her as soon as she became pregnant, so that Peter Khodataev was born as an illegitimate son and raised under his mother's surname. The merchant didn't accept the child and later bought off her with a land and two houses. This allowed Agafia Khodataeva to give her son proper education at the Rostov-on-Don realschule. Peter soon married a local midwife Anna. By the time Nikolai was born, he had made a successful career as a tsarist official and could afford to pay for his son's art lessons.The Stars of Russian Animation. Film 2. Nikolai Khodataev by Irina Margolina and Eduard Nazarov, 2010 (in Russian) In 1898 the family moved to Moscow. At the age of 20 Nikolai, who had already decided to study fine art at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture, made a trip to the Caucasus in order to train in landscape painting. He was accepted as a student and finished the school in 1918 when it had already been reformed into Vkhutemas by the Soviet government. He continued studying at the architecture department and joined the State Committee for the Preservattion of Ancient Monuments upon graduation. Career Interplanetary Revolution (1924) In 1924 Nikolai Khodataev along with the fellow artists Yuri Merkulov and Zenon Komissarenko were hired by Yakov Protazanov to make sketches for his upcoming science fiction movie Aelita. The three suggested to produce a segment that would've mixed live action with animation, but Protazanov rejected the idea.Larisa Malyukova (2013). OVERcinema. Modern Russian animation. — Saint Petersburg: Umnaya Masha, p. 264 Khodataev then used his own money to set up an experimental workshop under the State School of Cinematography which became the first animation studio in the USSR. Their 20-minute film Interplanetary Revoluion was one of the first Soviet animated films made as a parody of Aelita and the current political situation. The artists made excessive use of cutout animation (called flat marionettes at the time) along with the constructivism art style that was at its peak in Russia, which resulted in a distinguishable look and feel. The film was a great success. In 1925 they were hired by the Soviet government to produce China in Flames, another cutout animation critical of European interference in Chinese economy, this time serious in tone and message. Vladimir Suteev along with the young Vkhutemas graduates Ivan Ivanov-Vano and the Brumberg sisters joined the team which led to a variety of art styles. With 1000 meters of film and 14 frames per second it ran over 50 minutes at the time, which made it the first Soviet animated feature film and one of the first in the world.Sergey Kapkov (2006). Encyclopedia of Domestic Animation, p. 14 In 1926 Khodataev moved to Mezhrabpom-Rus where he directed a number of traditionally animated and live action films. Among his notable works were One of Many (1927) about the adventures of a Komsomol girl in Hollywood that featured both filming techniques and The Samoyed Boy (1928). The latter presented a story about a Nenets child that followed a dramatic narrative which Khodataev described as \\"the first steps in conquering the tradegy genre\\". It was stylized as traditional Nenets art and used an innovative technique of printing on thin celluloid. Same year he directed a live short Pushkin's Housewarming that was banned by censorship. His experiments started getting less and less support from government that wanted to see comic agitprop and advertisements instead which Khodataev despised. The Samoyed Boy (1928) Between 1928 and 1935 he worked at Sovkino. In 1933-1934 he directed his last two animated films: The Little Organ, an adaptation of The History of a Town by Mikhail Saltykov- Shchedrin, and Fialkin's Career about an ambitious fool. Both featured original graphical style inspired by the works of Vladimir Favorsky as well as smooth animation, \\"manifesting a plasticity of animation movement and the filmmaker's ability to nudge animation towards real art\\".Sergei Asenin (2012). The World of Animation // The Tropes of Soviet Animation. — Moscow: Print-on- Demand, p. 44 Nevertheless, they went almost unnoticed, which made Khodataev question the purpose of his work. He left animation around the time Soyuzmultfilm was created, feeling that the industry wasn't up to bold experiments.Nikolai Khodataev on why he left animation letter published at the Notes by Film Historian magazine, 2001 (in Russian) Nikolai Khodataev spent the rest of his days living in a shadow and dedicated his life to art and sculpture. According to his friends and relatives, he used every opportunity to paint everything that surrounded him. In contrast to animation, in art he preferred the Renaissance period, drew many portraits, mostly women.Irina Margolina, Eduard Nazarov. Animation from A to Z. Episodes 16, 17 documentary by REN TV, 1997 He also took part in art exhibitions.Nikolai Petrovich Khodataev: Exhibition catalogue // Moscow branch of the Union of Artists of the RSFSR, 1977 at the Russian State Library In addition, he wrote articles for the Soviet Screen and Iskusstvo Kino magazines and produced animation for theatrical plays staged at the Natalya Sats Musical Theater.Nikolai Khodataev at the Encyclopedia of National Cinema (in Russian) Nikolai Khodataev died in Moscow in 1979. He was survived by his daughter Nela and his son Konstantin, also an artist. His sister Olga Khodataeva (1894—1968) was also a prominent Soviet animator who worked with her brother on some of his major films before joining Soyuzmultfilm.Olga Khodataeva at Animator.ru Their brother Alexei Khodataev, a musician, left memoirs that give insight into the history of the Khodataev family.

However, he \\"won notoriety rather from his eccentricities than any eminent qualifications\\". Dods listed him as a Liberal until 1884, and thereafter as a crossbencher.
