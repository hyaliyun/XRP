For much of its history, the company was owned by Sun Life Assurance. The Street Railway was one of a very few that also ran freight using electric locomotives on the same lines, connecting the industrial areas along the river bank on either side of town to the Grand Trunk Railway on the northern side of town. Freight services continued after the passenger service ended. The original operating company remains as Cornwall Electric. The company sold power from its hydroelectric assets on the St. Lawrence River since its formation, and today operates as a local distribution company. Although the main lines in the downtown area were lifted in the 1950s, a number of lines outside town remain in use as industrial spurs. History An abortive early street railway attempt began in 1885 under the charter of the Cornwall Street Railway Company, which was filed on 11 November 1885 and authorized by the town council a month later, on 14 December. This early street railway was equipped with steam-driven rolling stock, but reportedly the rolling stock sat in the Grand Trunk Railway yard for a number of years unused after arrival, and the street railway had minimal to no operations. Just over ten years later, a second attempt at a street railway began. On 28 December 1895, the Cornwall town council granted a second street railway charter. This charter was held by the Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company (CESR), which was incorporated in 1896. Initial passenger-only service began on 1 July 1896, marking the commonly-accepted start of Cornwall's street railway era. Ridership grew quickly, but the company's financial situation was difficult, and freight service was introduced in 1899 in the hopes of generating more revenue. This resulted in a unique freight switching service which allowed freight cars to be easily transferred to and from the steam mainline and the electric street railway, reducing freight overhead costs. In 1902, the company's bondholder, the Sun Life Assurance Company, foreclosed. This put Sun Life in the unique position of being an insurance company which owned a railway. Sun Life rechartered and relaunched the company as the Cornwall Street Railway, Light and Power Company, Limited (CSRL&P;). This management philosophy in the burgeoning electrical industry in Ontario became increasingly common in the lead-up to the founding of the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario, as companies sought to vertically integrate electrical power production, distribution, and consumption, especially in the form of electric railways and municipal lighting companies. This local consolidation was completed in 1905 with a merger with the purchase of the Stormont Electric Light and Power Company, resulting in consolidation of the two companies and greater financial sustainability. Street railways were often politically contentious, especially when managed by private companies, and around the time of the First World War through the 1920s there was a wave of street railway unionizations, strikes, and incidents of civil unrest such as the 1914 Saint John street railway strike in Saint John, New Brunswick. The Cornwall street railway system was not immune and on 3 December 1919 the company was unionized under the Amalgamated Association of Street and Electric Railway Employees of America. However, the company would continue to work to trim down its workforce and cut costs, switching from two-man to one-man crews in 1927 and 1930. The last significant expansions to the system occurred in the 1930s. In 1931, tracks were installed on Cumberland Street, creating a southern loop along with Water, Pitt, and Second Streets. This was followed in 1934 with the installation of tracks up Cumberland Street to Seventh Street, then across to Pitt Street, completing a second loop. In 1936, the street railway was involved in a civil disturbance, as a motorman attempted to bypass a picket line at the Cortaulds plant to move freight cars on the plant siding. Eight strikers were arrested by the Ontario Provincial Police. Like with many electric street and interurban railways, the system's swan song occurred during the Second World War, which stimulated freight and commuter traffic and reversed much of the industrial slump caused by the Great Depression. Industrial production had begun to gradually consolidate, and factories became larger and more suburban, forcing workers to commute to them. In Cornwall, the then-secret mustard gas plant on Wallrich Avenue led to the final extension of the system's lines. This would be some of the last passenger traffic on the system, as passenger service would be phased out shortly after the war. Street railway service was interrupted repeatedly in 1947 by strikes. In August, streetcar operators engaged in a two-day strike for higher wages. This conflict eventually went to arbitration, and workers won a wage increase from one cent to six cents per hour in some departments. However, this was followed almost immediately by a second, eight-day strike in September, as the company had scaled wage increases to pay rather than applying a blanket increase, which the union claimed as overstepping its authority, and renewed its demand for a 12-cent increase. Ultimately, the strike was ended when the union, management, and Ontario Minister of Labour Charles Daley met in Toronto and scrapped the earlier arbitration decision, replacing it with a blanket retroactive 5-cent increase, plus a 3-cent increase going forward, and improvements to overtime pay. In 1949, the company made the decision to end streetcar service permanently and switch to trolleybus service. This was a part of the general postwar wave of streetcar elimination in North America. Many systems had been poorly maintained during the 1930s and 1940s, as the war and the Great Depression starved them of funds and materials for repair, and many streetcar manufacturers closed or shifted to manufacturing other types of vehicles, making it difficult and expensive to purchase new streetcars, as opposed to cheaper, standardized bus models. Auto manufacturers had grown explosively during the Second World War due to government contracts for military vehicles, and public funds became more widely available for paved asphalt roads and highway construction. By the early 1970s, Sun Life began to slowly divest itself of the company, and various aspects of its operations were sold off. Electrical distribution continued under Cornwall Electric, freight under CN Rail, and passenger transportation under the municipally- owned Cornwall Transit. In a contentious move, trolleybuses were replaced with diesel buses in 1971, and the historic depot at Pitt and Water Streets which had served the system since 1896 was demolished and replaced with the Cornwall Square mall. This ended one of the last visible remnants of the streetcar service. Railway operations, however, did not end, and electric freight service continued until 1971, shortly after the company's freight operations were purchased by CN Rail. Electric freight service was replaced with diesel as part of a general wave of dieselization of the remaining electric freight railways in Ontario. Dieselization allowed companies to abandon the then-aging electric rolling stock, and to operate the same diesel trains on formerly- electric rail lines as on non-electric mainlines, simplifying freight operations. The last electric freight operation occurred on Saturday 9 October 1971, on what was a cold and rainy day. However, by this point the remaining railway infrastructure had been reduced to a number of industrial spurs connecting to the CN mainline, with most of the original street running sections having been removed in the 1950s after the switch to trolleybuses for passenger service. Routes The first two routes, in 1896, were a route on Pitt Street and a route on Montreal Street. In 1949, the last year of streetcar service, three routes in total were operated along Montreal Street, Pitt Street, and a belt line. Rolling stock None of the early steam rolling stock is known to have survived. Some later vehicles and pieces of equipment, however, have been preserved in various forms: * #11 (freight motor) is displayed at the Ohio Railway Museum under its original livery as Youngstown and Ohio River Railroad #7 * #16 (freight motor) is displayed at the Halton County Radial Railway under its later livery as Lake Erie and Northern Railway #335 * #17 (freight motor) is on permanent display in Cornwall * B-1 (snow sweeper) is in storage at the Canada Science and Technology Museum * #3152 (snow plow) built in 1925 by Canadian Car and Foundry is displayed at the Shore Line Trolley Museum  See also  * Cornwall, Ontario * Cornwall Electric * Cornwall Transit References External links Local Railway Items from Ottawa Papers - Cornwall Street Railway companies established in 1885 Transport in Cornwall, Ontario Defunct Ontario railways Street railways in Canada Cornwall 1947 labor disputes and strikes ","title":"Cornwall Street Railway"},{"id":"47147762","text":"\\"Git\\" (Turkish: Go) is a song from Candan Er√ßetin's sixth studio album Kƒ±rƒ±k Kalpler Duraƒüƒ±nda.

It was discontinued without a replacement in the United States, although the Kingsway series remained available in export markets. The Wayfarer was the first true roadster built by the Big Three since the 1930s.Godshall, p. 72 However, the roadster concept was soon altered to the plusher Sportabout as higher comfort levels were demanded by the post-war auto buyers.Godshall, p. 79 9325 roadsters and Sportabouts were built, out of a total of 217,623 Wayfarers of all bodystyles.Godshall, p. 81 1949 The \\"true\\" 1949 Dodges were introduced in February 1949, after a long production run of the 1948s. The Wayfarer (known as the D-29 series), aside from its shorter wheelbase, shared the boxy corporate design of the new 1949 Chrysler products. While much improved over the earlier Dodges, the Wayfarer still had to do without features such as a crankshaft dampener, the new Micronic oil filter, a splash- proof distributor, and rivetless brake linings. The windshield wipers were vacuum-powered rather than electric, and only the right-hand door received an exterior lock - the roadster receiving none. The Wayfarer arrived with three different bodystyles: a two-door sedan, a two-door business coupe, and the two-door roadster (only entering production in May).Godshall, p. 78 The business coupe shared some bodywork with Plymouth's business coupe version, but the other Wayfarer's had unique pressings. The roadster had removable plastic side windows instead of wind-down units, and a short top which eliminated the need for rear quarter windows. More permanent swing-out vent windows were available as an option. However, Californian regulations on hand signalling meant that roll-down windows had to be added quick and retro-fitted to Californian market vehicles. This happened in September, after which the roll-down windows became a rarely selected delete-option. A roadster with a rumble seat was even tested (with a bottom-hinged trunk lid), but the opening would have had to be moved and the cost of tooling up for such an option meant that it was soon dropped. 1949 production totalled 63,816, equalling 25 percent of Dodge's total number. Of these, 49,054 were sedans, 9342 were coupes, and 5420 were roadsters. 1950 A 1950 Dodge Wayfarer two-door sedan For 1950, the D-33 Wayfarers (as for the entire Dodge lineup) received a facelift with a sleeker grille, new bumpers, and new rear fenders with the taillights mounted directly on them. Mid-year, the roadster was renamed Sportabout as Chrysler realized that very few \\"true\\" roadsters were sold. The Sportabout, unlike the rest of the Wayfarer line, also received a body moulding which extended onto the front doors. A one-barrel, L-head inline-six of was installed, with . This was to be the only engine option for the Wayfarer's entire production run. A disastrous 104-day strike, lasting from 25 January until 8 May, hamstrung all of Chrysler's production this year. Meanwhile, the arrival of the Rambler Landau convertible meant serious competition for the roadster. While a little more expensive, the new Rambler was much more comprehensively equipped and could seat five rather than two people. Business coupe production also dropped, although the sedan increased for a better overall than in 1949. 75,403 were built, made up of 65,000 sedans, 7500 coupes, and 2903 roadsters/Sportabouts. 1951-1952 1952 Dodge Wayfarer business coupe 1951's D-41 Wayfarers received a thorough upgrade, with a new hood, front fenders, and new slotted grille in two sections. The windshield was bigger and the dashboard new, and underneath there were new \\"Oriflow\\" shock absorbers. 1951 was the last year that the Sportabout was available with the removable side windows. A period road tester (Tom McCahill, for Mechanix Illustrated) reached a top speed, and sixty mph from standing was reached in 17.4 seconds. The 1952s were nearly identical to the 1951s, with Dodge not even bothering to separate the yearly sales numbers. When the 1952s were introduced, the Sportabout was listed with an asterisk regarding availability but was not produced. The business coupe was discontinued in February 1952, with material shortages due to the Korean War forcing automobile manufacturers to focus on their more popular models. Thus, only the two-door sedan was available for most of the Wayfarer's last model year. Production for 1951 and 1952 totalled 78,404, of which 70,700 were sedans, 6702 business coupes, and a mere 1002 of the 1951 Sportabouts. For 1953, the \\"Meadowbrook Special\\" series was added to replace the Wayfarer at the lower end of Dodge's lineup. Chrysler Wayfarer Chrysler AP3 Wayfarer The Wayfarer model name was also used by Chrysler Australia for the Chrysler Wayfarer, a series of ute models built between late 1958 and 1960 (AP2 and AP3 models, some perhaps built as late as 1961) in 1205 examples. Later, there was a ute called the \\"Chrysler Valiant Wayfarer\\". This model was built from April 1965 until August 1971.

He spent a year in teaching in Virginia, and in 1818 entered Andover Theological Seminary, where he completed the course in 1821. He was ordained and installed pastor of the Congregational Church in Longmeadow, Mass., March 5, 1823, and there remained until called to the 3rd Presbyterian Church in Newark, N.J., where he was installed November 17, 1829. He labored successfully for six years in that relation, and then accepted an invitation to the Professorship of Sacred Rhetoric and Pastoral Theology in Lane Seminary, Cincinnati. After four years of active devotion to the interests of that institution, he accepted an appointment to the corresponding chair in the seminary in Auburn, N.Y., and held the position eight years. For ten years he served the American and Foreign Christian Union as one of its District Secretaries at New York and Boston, and then removed with his family to Lake Forest, near Chicago, where with them he opened a Young Ladies' Seminary, which was successfully maintained until 1867. The infirmities of age rendering necessary a retirement from all labor, he removed in 1868 to Brooklyn, N. Y., to spend his closing years, and died in that city, December 5, 1875. In 1838 he received the degree of Doctor of Divinity from Amherst College. He was the author of the paper known as the \\"True Doctrines,\\" which was adopted in 1837 as the exponent of the doctrinal beliefs of the New School branch of the Presbyterian Church, and received the endorsement of both branches at the late Reunion. In 1839 he was the moderator of the New School General Assembly. He published several sermons, and some of these, as well as a volume of Letters to Students, were republished in England.

It encompasses aspects of cell biophysics, biomechanics, soft matter physics and rheology, mechanobiology and cell biology.  Eukaryotic Cell Mechanics  Eukaryotic cells are cells that consist of membrane-bound organelles, a membrane-bound nucleus, and more than one linear chromosome. Being much more complex than prokaryotic cells, cells without a true nucleus, eukaryotes must protect its organelles from outside forces. Plant cell structure Plant cell mechanics Plant cell mechanics combines principles of biomechanics and mechanobiology to investigate the growth and shaping of the plant cells. Plant cells, similar to animal cells, respond to externally applied forces, such as by reorganization of their cytoskeletal network. The presence of a considerably rigid extracellular matrix, the cell wall, however, bestows the plant cells with a set of particular properties. Mainly, the growth of plant cells is controlled by the mechanics and chemical composition of the cell wall. A major part of research in plant cell mechanics is put toward the measurement and modeling of the cell wall mechanics to understand how modification of its composition and mechanical properties affects the cell function, growth and morphogenesis.  Animal Cell Mechanics  Animal cell structure Because animal cells do not have cell walls to protect them like plant cells, they require other specialized structures to sustain external mechanical forces. All animal cells are encased within a cell membrane made of a thin lipid bilayer that protects the cell from exposure to the outside environment. Using receptors composed of protein structures, the cell membrane is able to let selected molecules within the cell. Inside the cell membrane includes the cytoplasm, which contains the cytoskeleton. A network of filamentous proteins including microtubules, intermediate filaments, and actin filaments makes up the cytoskeleton and helps maintain the cell's shape. By working together, the three types of polymers can organize themselves to counter the applied external forces and resist deformation. However, there are differences between the three polymers. The primary structural component of the cytoskeleton is actin filaments. Being the narrowest with a diameter of 7 nm and most flexible out of the three types of polymers, actin filaments are typically found at the very edge of the cytoplasm in animal cells. Formed by the linking of polymers of a protein called actin, they help give cells shape and structure and are able to transport protein packages and organelles. Furthermore, actin filaments have the ability to be assembled and disassembled quickly, allowing them to take part in cell mobility. On the other hand, intermediate filaments are more permanent structures with a diameter of 8 to 10 nm. Composed of numerous fibrous protein strands wound together, intermediate proteins‚Äô main role is bearing tension and retaining the shape and structure of the cell by securing the nucleus and other organelles in their designated areas. The largest cytoskeletal structure of the three types of polymers is the microtubules with a diameter of 25 nm. Unlike actin filaments, microtubules are stiff, hollow structures that radiate outwards from the microtubule organizing center (MTOC). Composed of tubulin proteins, microtubules are dynamic structures that allows them to shrink or grow with the addition or removal of tubulin proteins. In terms of cell mechanics, microtubules‚Äô main purpose is to resist compressive cellular forces and act as a transportation system for motor proteins. Measuring cell mechanics  Because cells are tiny, soft objects that must be measured differently than materials like metal, plastic, and glass, new techniques have been developed for the accurate measurement of cell mechanics. The variety of techniques can be divided into two categories: force application techniques and force sensing techniques. In case of walled cells, such as plant or fungal cells, due to existence of a stiff, anisotropic and curved cell wall encapsulating the cells, special considerations and tailored approaches may be required compared to the methods used to measure the mechanics of animal cells.  Force application  Force application techniques uses the cell's response of deformation to force applied onto the cell as a way to measure cell mechanical properties. There are several different types of force application techniques including: # Micropipette aspiration uses applied suction pressure with a small diameter glass pipet. The measurement of the length of aspiration caused by the suction pressure can reveal several cell mechanical properties. # Cantilever manipulation operates through an magnetic, electrical, or mechanical interaction between a probe and the surface of the cell that gives off a signal that can be used to measure mechanical properties. # Optical techniques involves the usage of trapped photons to manipulate cells. The photons will change in direction based on the cell's refractive index, which will cause a change in momentum, leading to a force applied upon the cell. # Mechanical techniques utilizes the incorporation of ferromagnetic beads into the cell or attached to specific receptors on the cell. When a magnetic force is applied, the stretch of the membrane can be measured to calculate mechanical properties. # Substrate strain measures elasticity through stretching the cell. The elasticity of the cell provides information that can determine motility and adhesion. # Compression requires the usage of applied pressure onto the entire cell. By calculating the changes of the cell's shape, compression is a way to measure mechanical responses to force. # Flow technique uses Reynold's number, a dimensionless number in fluid mechanics, to distinguish whether the cell is subject to laminar, transitional, or turbulent flow.  Force sensing  # Wrinkling membranes requires putting the cell into a flexible silicon envelope. As the cell contracts, the magnitude of the forces can be estimated by utilizing the length and number of wrinkles. #Traction force microscopy detects deformations through comparison of images the movement of fluorescent beads that have been adhered to the cell. # Cantilever sensing can detect surface stresses with the attachment of micromechanical beams on one end of the cell. #Bioreactors allow the measurement of multicellular forces in a three-dimensional system, while external forces are applied at the same time. This enables better results and more accurate data from complex experiments. #When adherent cells are excited by surface acoustic waves, they start to generate acoustic microstreaming flow. The velocity magnitude of this flow near the cell membrane is directly proportional to the stiffness (i.e., modulus of elasticity) of the cell.

(2019) Dancing with the Cells: Acoustic Microflows Generated by Oscillating Cells. https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.201903788  Research  Researchers who study cell mechanics are interested in the mechanics and dynamics of the assemblies and structures that make up the cell including membranes, cytoskeleton, organelles, and cytoplasm, and how they interact to give rise to the emergent properties of the cell as a whole. A particular focus of many cell mechanical studies has been the cytoskeleton, which (in animal cells) can be thought to consist of: # actomyosin assemblies (F-actin, myosin motors, and associated binding, nucleating, capping, stabilizing, and crosslinking proteins), # microtubules and their associated motor proteins (kinesins and dyneins), # intermediate filaments, # other assemblies such as spectrins and septins. The active non-equilibrium and non-linear rheological properties of cellular assemblies have been keen point of research in recent times. Another point of interest has been how cell cycle-related changes in cytoskeletal activity affect global cell properties, such as intracellular pressure increase during mitotic cell rounding.

In 1897, Gr√§ser lived in Diefenbach's commune, Himmelhof, located in Ober Sankt Veit, near Vienna, and embraced his ideas of pacifism, a human civilization in harmony with nature, and a vegetarian diet, while studying art. However, Gr√§ser was dissuaded by Diefenbach's despotic leadership, and left the commune in 1898 to form his own following in Munich. In 1900, Gr√§ser completely cut ties with his hometown to wander, and co-founded his own commune near Monte Verit√† in Ascona with his brother, Karl Gr√§ser. Among the settlement's inhabitants included several artists and authors such as Otto Gross, Leonhard Frank, Erich Muhsam, Franziska Countess zu Reventlow, and Hermann Hesse, whom Gr√§ser influenced in his written works. Gr√§ser helped fund the commune by giving lectures in various cities and selling copies of his poetry, but was often faced with ridicule for his appearance. In 1911, Gr√§ser moved his family of six to the outskirts of Berlin. He became a leading figure in the political reconstruction of the youth movement, in particular, the Free German Youth Movement. However, Gr√§ser's teachings were met with hostility, in 1912 he was arrested and expelled from Saxony, and again from Baden in the following year. In 1915, Gr√§ser was deported to Austria and sentenced to death for being a conscientious objector, but, instead, was ruled to be legally insane, and was transported to a mental institution. After he was released, Gr√§ser briefly returned to Mount Verita, before becoming an activist against the First World War. Although he was expelled from Bavaria in 1919, Gr√§ser migrated with a \\"new crowd\\" known as the \\"crusade of love\\" with his associate, Friedrich Muck- Lamberty, which was a subject in Hesse's story, Journey to the East. In 1927, Gr√§ser began public speaking in Berlin's Anti-War Museum, settled in the commune of Grunhurst, and traveled through Germany with his son, Otto Brobohmig, to distribute his writings. When the Nazi Party came to power in 1933, Grunhurst was destroyed, and many of its inhabitants, including some of Gr√§ser's family, were killed or sent to internment camps in 1936. Gr√§ser managed to avoid capture by fleeing to Munich, living in seclusion in fellow poets' attics, and wrote some of his most acclaimed pieces including Siebenmah and Wunderbar. After continuing his travels through Germany, Gr√§ser died in 1958 in Munich. His unpublished poetry was saved before the destruction of his home and preserved in the Municipal Library in Munich.

According to film reviewer Gary Morris, Carmen was \\"well played\\" by Uta Levka; lighting and camerawork by Hans Jura was \\"first-rate\\".

Washington, 405 U.S. 313 (1972), the Supreme Court of the United States decided that the manager of a drive-in movie theater could not be charged with obscenity for showing the film which was not wholly determined to be obscene, but only parts were, holding that the citizens of Washington State had no notice under the Sixth Amendment that the place where a film was shown was an element of the offense.

Notes According to one film reviewer, Radley Metzger's films, including those made during the Golden Age of Porn (1969‚Äì1984), are noted for their \\"lavish design, witty screenplays, and a penchant for the unusual camera angle\\".

From its inception in 1995 until 2018 it was known as Burnley FC Girls and Ladies. The team is currently a member of the .  History  Burnley FC Girls & Ladies was founded in 1995 by John Lister, just too late for hometown girl and former England international goalkeeper Rachel Brown-Finnis to join as a child. The club initially consisted of 15 ladies, who trained in the old sports barn at Turf Moor and played their home games at the club's training facility at Gawthorpe. Following the demise of the Lancashire League, the team joined the North West Women's Regional League. The club established a strong junior set- up from the outset. An Under 10s side was formed by Grahame Meeks and Peter Cooper shortly after the First Team was founded. In 2019, with almost 150 registered players, the club is one of the largest female only football clubs in the North West.  The Club  The youth set-up was grassroots for many years, to encourage players of all ages and abilities to take-up football. But from the start of the 2019/20 season players of all ages were required to negotiate trials to represent the club. Several former players have advanced to the highest levels of the domestic game. In 2014, after signing for Manchester United 13-year-old player Naomi Hartley commented: \\"I am a Burnley fan and have a season ticket, but you can‚Äôt turn down the chance to play for Manchester United. Now my aim is to play for England.\\" In 2016, her dream came true when she made her debut for England Women's Under 16s against Germany. She then captained the team for the last 25 minutes in a 2‚Äì1 win over Norway at St George's Park in December. On 3 September 2017, former players Cara Milne-Redhead (Manchester United RTC) and Sadie Mitchell (Manchester City Development) were selected for the Scotland Women's u17 squad to travel to Slovenia. They then featured in the Women's u17 European Championship Preliminary Round played in Latvia between 14 and 20 October. Several Clarets players have also won scholarships to play 'soccer' in the North American college system. At the end of the 2014/15 Season Sophie Greenwood and Hannah Till signed to play for Indian Hills Community College in Iowa. Natalie Bell and Simone Keating headed to the States at the end of the 2015/16 Season to play for Queens University of Charlotte in North Carolina and Southwestern Christian University in Bethany, Oklahoma respectively, whilst First Team player Taylor Gregson took up a coaching opportunity in New Jersey.  2014/15 season  A new management structure brought about changes off the field. On it, the club's two open age teams experienced successful seasons. The First Team finished fourth in the North West Women's Regional League Premier Division, whilst the newly formed Senior Development Squad finished as runners-up in the Lancashire County Football Association Division 2, securing promotion in their first full season under the guidance of Manager Aidy Lamb. In just their second season the Under 9 Clarets shared the WLGFL League Cup with Blackpool, coming from behind to draw 3‚Äì3 with 'The Tangerines'. They then went on to secure the WLGFL Premier League title.  2015/16 season  This was the club's 20th Anniversary Season of playing competitive football. The First Team started their Premier League campaign strongly, but faded towards the end of the season and promotion eluded them for another year. The Senior Development Squad more than held their own in the top division of county football. There was considerable success in the junior ranks. In the West Lancashire Girls Football League, the Under 10s completed the league and cup double for the second consecutive season; the Under 15s won the North Valley & Burnley Unity Youth Football League at the first time of asking and the Under 16s defeated local rivals Blackburn in the final of the County Cup.  2016/17 season  At the start of the 2016/17 Season the club embarked on a new chapter in its history; strengthening its links with Burnley F.C., by joining forces with its nominated charity Burnley FC in the Community. Matt Bee was appointed as the first full-time Female Football Development Officer and is responsible for overseeing development throughout the club. He also took on the role of First Team Manager and led the team to a best ever third- place finish in the North West Women's Regional League Premier Division, behind Bolton Wanderers (promoted) and Wigan Athletic. In the youth ranks the Under 11s were unable to repeat their league and cup double for a third successive season. But whilst they lost out by the odd goal in five to Preston North End in the League Cup semi final, they retained a share the WLGFL Premier League title by finishing level on points with Lostock Hall JFC Panthers. Elsewhere the Under 15s lost out on the league title when they were beaten by Feniscowles & Pleasington JFC in a championship decider on the final day of the season.  2017/18 season  The club introduced a new Open Age Pathway to bring talented young players from the junior system into the First Team set-up at the earliest opportunity. The First Team had its most successful season on record. They won their three preliminary round games in the SSE Women's FA Cup, to qualify for the First Round proper for the first time in their history. A win away at Alnwick Town was followed by an upset victory over Stoke City in the Second Round, following a penalty shoot out. Their reward was another away trip to face Women's FA Premier League opponents. A late goal for Cardiff City saw the Clarets, the lowest ranked team still in the competition, lose out by the odd goal in five. Cup success initially had an adverse effect on league results. But the confidence gained from their excellent cup run saw the team go unbeaten in their final league games. An important win at closest rivals Stockport County opened the door to the league title and the team gained promotion to the FA Women's National League Division 1 North. In the youth ranks the club fielded two teams in the under 11 and under 13 age groups for the first time. The new under 13s Blue team announced its arrival by winning the Burnley Unity and North Valley League title. After the season the club was rebranded Burnley FC Women.  2018/19 season  The club's First Team began its first season outside the regional and county leagues in the newly formed FA Women's National League Division One North. At the end of the season the Lady Clarets clinched the title, and a second successive promotion, with a 3‚Äì0 win at Crewe Alexandra. The following season Burnley FC Women would play in FA Women's National League North, the third tier of women's football.  2019/20 season  The step up to the National League saw an influx of new players to the First Team squad. The season started well and the team went unbeaten in its first five games. In February the Lady Clarets exited the FA Cup in the fourth round, after a 3‚Äì1 defeat at Leicester City. Following a home win over Loughborough Foxes on 8 March, the team lay fifth in the table with just three league defeats. The season was then paused due to the worldwide coronavirus pandemic. The club's junior teams were experiencing mixed fortunes. In late February the club announced that Becky Clough would oversee their operation, enabling Matt Bee to focus on First Team affairs.

It was the home of Edward VII's private banker Sir Ernest Cassel and his granddaughter. Upon his death in 1921, the house was left to Edwina Cynthia Annette Ashley, daughter of The 1st Baron Mount Temple (by the second creation) and Amalia Mary Maud Cassel. She sold the property in 1931, it was built into flats in 1933 and one of the first tenants was Harry Selfridge, who occupied a flat there in 1936. History In 1854, Dudley Marjoribanks, MP (later created, in 1880, The 1st Baron Tweedmouth), purchased the lot on the corner which was numbered 29. A decade later, he acquired the adjacent lot numbered 28 and sought permission to build a mansion overlooking the park, based upon designs from Thomas Henry Wyatt. Construction began in 1867 and completed in 1869 on the large red brick structure with Portland stone dressings. The house had French fa√ßades, and a number of bays and balconies. The interior from the entrance on Upper Brook Street opened to a mahogany staircase that rose two stories, lined in variegated marble. The library was furnished in cherry paneling and the dining room was decorated with carving from the recently demolished Draper's Hall. After the death of The 1st Baron Tweedmouth, the 2nd Baron added a porch to the house where lot 27 had been. A reversal in his financial situation caused him to sell the house in 1904. Ernest Cassel not only bought Brook House, but he also bought the Baron's country estate at Guisachan. Between 1905 and 1907, Cassel carried out renovations to the property designed by architect Arnold Mitchell and built by the firm of Holland and Hannen. The interiors were done by Charles Allom, decorator for the Royal Family. The house had 24 bedrooms, 11 reception rooms, a sixty-foot-long ballroom, a grand dining room which had seating for 100 guests, and 800 tons of Tuscan marble in the main hall and staircase alone. Cassel's granddaughter, who would later become Countess Mountbatten, had from the time she was a child and her mother died, had a room in his home. Upon Cassel's death, the house passed to his sister, Wilhelmina Cassel, but Edwina continued to live there. She and Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma married in a lavish ceremony in 1922 with the Prince of Wales serving as best man and the king and queen in attendance. After the ceremony, the reception was held in Brook House and the couple moved into a suite on the third floor. When Wilhelmina Cassel died in 1925, the house became Edwina's outright and they remodeled the house with a naval motif. The master bedroom was designed like the cabin of a battleship, complete with portholes, cork- lined ceiling and brass handrails. In 1931, Edwina put the house up for sale citing high taxes and the cost to maintain the property, but there were some problems with the will, forcing delays. George Gee of the building firm Gee, Walker and Slater, bought the major interest and the house was mostly demolished and rebuilt in 1933‚Äì35 with neo-Georgian designs similar to the neighboring houses. Each floor had a single flat. The Mountbattens' double- story penthouse was not completed until 1937 and could only be reached by a private, express elevator. The lower flats began being rented out and one of the early occupants was Harry Selfridge, who had a flat there in 1936. In 1998, a demolition and renovation was completed on the property by contractors Higgs and Hill for Brook House Developments Ltd. Upon completion, the property contained basement parking, commercial space on the ground and first floors, 16 luxury apartments and a single penthouse occupying the seventh and eighth floors.

T. helluo was formerly known as Hogna helluo before differences between dorsal color patterns, habitat preferences, body structures, etc. were discovered. The species is native to the United States, Canada and Mexico. They can be found across the eastern half of the United States, primarily in the northeast section or New England states. They can also be found along the east coast and even as far west as Nebraska or Kansas. T. helluo can be found in many habitats within these states including woods, marshes, fields, and riparian areas. Typically, they prefer to live in wetter areas as opposed to dry environments. Normally, males will live for around a year and females will live for close to two years. The defining characteristic of T. helluo is its brown carapace and distinct yellow stripe starting from its anterior eyes extending down the cephalothorax. The underside of the abdomen has distinct black spots that distinguish T. helluo from other wolf spiders. At an average size of around 17 mm, T. helluo is one of the smaller wolf spiders. In addition, females tend to be larger than males. Like other spiders of the family Lycosidae, wolf spiders are solitary and will live and hunt alone. Unless in the process of mating, T. helluo will remain alone. They are usually active at night and actively hunt prey then. In addition, T. helluo do not create webs, although females will make burrows under rocks or boards. Relying on their excellent eyesight and senses, T. helluo are great hunters. In terms of interactions with humans, T. helluo is not very aggressive and will not attack unless provoked. Their bites do inject venom, however to humans, it is not medically significant. Pain and swelling will occur, but nothing more serious than that. Anti-venom is rarely needed.  Description  The average body length for Tigrosa can be 10-31 mm for females and 11-24 mm for males while for T. helluo, body length averages at 17 mm. Compared to its close relative Tigrosa aspersa, T. helluo is much smaller. Its carapace consists of a brownish color contrasting with a distinctive yellow stripe that extends from the anterior eyes to the cephalothorax. Starting from the posterior median eyes, a set of fainter yellow stripes extend posteriorly. In addition, the underside of the abdomen is marked with several black spots. Patterns found on the dorsal side of the cephalothorax and abdomen are similar to those found on Tigrosa gerogicola, however the faint yellow stripes appearing on T. helluo do not extend as far. Black spots found on the abdomen of T. helluo are also not found on T. georgicola. Coloration in the legs differ between genders, males‚Äô legs appearing yellow without distinct markings and females‚Äô legs appearing reddish brown without additional markings or bands.  Habitat and distribution   Habitat  Tigrosa helluo can be found throughout the United States. Primarily they reside along the east coast in the New England region but can be found along the entire east coast down to Florida. Further west, T. helluo resides in most states in the eastern half of the US. They can be found as far west as Kansas and Nebraska.  Distribution  Tigrosa helluo is native to the United States, Canada and Mexico. In the United States, it can be found in a large variety of states, in woods, marshes, and even grassy areas in northeastern states such as Connecticut. More specifically, their nests are often found under stones or boards in fields and woods except for males, as they are not found in nests.Muma, M. H. (1943). Common spiders of Maryland. Natural History Society of Maryland, Baltimore, 179 pp. These nests consist of burrows lined with silk.Kaston, B. J. (1948). Spiders of Connecticut. Bulletin of the Connecticut State Geological and Natural History Survey 70: 1-874. However, in states like Florida or Mississippi, T. helluo can most often be found in wetter areas such as marshes or lakes.  Reproduction and life cycle  Mating for T. helluo usually occurs in May or June. Males will live for just over one year while females will often live for around two years.Balfour, R. (2004). Differences in the growth of the wolf spider Hogna helluo (Araneae: Lycosidae) reared under high and low food quantity diets. (Electronic Thesis or Dissertation). Retrieved from https://etd.ohiolink.edu/ For males, maturation will occur between May and September. Egg sacs will be made in May and also July. They can range from 8-12 mm in size (diameter). The eggs by themselves can appear tan or yellow and are around 1-2 mm in diameter. Females will carry these eggs in an egg sac on their back until they hatch. Even after they hatch, the female will continue to carry the hatchlings on their back until they mature enough to hunt by themselves. For females, maturation can happen anytime throughout the year. Once mature, females will begin to overwinter during colder months. Males typically will die before it gets too cold. As T. helluo matures, it will molt periodically depending on nutritional intake in order to increase in size. The frequency of molting is based on its nutritional reserves. Individuals that feed more often will molt less frequently in their process of maturing.  Mating   Female-male dimorphism  Tigrosa helluo is sexually dimorphic, in this case, the two sexes dramatically differ in size. The females mature to be much larger in size. Typically, females will grow to weigh more than 300mg with carapace widths of around 6.5 mm while males will usually only weigh in excess of 200 mg and have carapace widths of around 4.5 mm. Balfour, R. (2004). Differences in the growth of the wolf spider Hogna helluo (Araneae: Lycosidae) reared under high and low food quantity diets. (Electronic Thesis or Dissertation). Retrieved from https://etd.ohiolink.edu/  Copulation  The process of copulation for T. helluo consists of a series of interactions between the male palp and the female epigynum. First, the male will mount the female such that they are facing opposite from each other. The underside of the cephalothorax is positioned against the dorsal section of the female‚Äôs abdomen. The male then will signal the female to rotate the abdomen by touching the anterior of the female abdomen. After this, the male will then use his palp to engage with the female‚Äôs abdomen and epigynum. The right and left palps will interact with the right and left sides of the epigynum. After the palp and epigynum are engaged, the male will expand his hematodocha, causing his embolus to go into the female copulatory duct. Semen is then exchanged. This whole interaction is called an insertion. During a single insertion, the male may also expand his hematodocha multiple times. However, it is more often only a single expansion per insertion. T. helluo will also engage in more than one insertion per copulation. Usually, one insertion will happen per side of the male palp. Copulation for T. helluo will last usually around 8 minutes.Stratton, G.E., Hebets, E.A., Miller, P.R., & Miller, G. (1996). PATTERN AND DURATION OF COPULATION IN WOLF SPIDERS (ARANEAE, LYCOSIDAE).  Diet   Prey  Wolf spiders (Lycosodae) will typically eat different kinds of insects or even other smaller spiders. They are nocturnal so they will wait for prey and hunt at night. T. helluo can survive on insects such as crickets (Acheta domesticus), fly grubs (Sarcophaga bullata), cockroaches (Periplaneta americana), mealworms (Tenebrio molitor), and even beetles (Dermestes).  Effects of diet on survivorship  Tigrosa helluo is able to feed on a large variety of prey, and thus will usually enjoy a mixed diet of different insects, etc. A 1992 study done about the effects of polytypic vs monotypic diets on wolf spiders found that those raised on polytypic diets had significantly higher survivorship in addition to reaching sexual maturity earlier in the case of T. helluo. Certain body parts like the cephalothorax and legs were also significantly larger at maturity in the polytypic diet group.  Effects of diet on behavior  A 1999 study done on the effect of feeding on burrow construction for T. helluo reported that hunger level will significantly impact T. helluo‚Äôs behavioral decisions. In comparison to starved spiders, the well fed ones had a better nutritional state and made significantly more burrows. Since males do not make burrows, they were not included in the study.  Predators  Wolf spiders, while they are hunters, are also preyed upon by other organisms such as praying mantises, birds, wasps, small reptiles, and even other spiders. Lycosidae have fantastic vision and are sensitive to vibrations, so they use these senses to detect and evade predators. They also use speed and camouflage from their natural coloring to avoid predators. For T. helluo, females make burrows in places like underneath stones that can also function as a place to hide from predators. If it is needed, T. helluo can also bite its predators and inject venom.  Behavior   Hunting  Tigrosa helluo will typically have a couple different foraging sites in which they will switch between. Females will build burrows of silk and wait for prey to show up in their current foraging site. Males will typically roam around and wait for prey. Like all wolf spiders do, T. helluo are solitary hunters and will hunt alone, only meeting with other spiders to mate.  Chemical cues in hunting  A 2001 study done on chemical cues in T. helluo suggests that T. helluo is able to detect chemical cues from recently hunted prey. The spiders will show a preference for chemical cues that go with their most recently hunted prey.  Communication  While wolf spiders are solitary and don‚Äôt usually associate with others outside of mating, communication between each other does occur occasionally. Wolf spiders have some of the best vision out of all spiders, so they use visual cues such as waving their pedipalps to signal to each other for mating. They are also sensitive to vibrations, scent, and taste.  Bites   Bites to humans  Wolf spiders are usually not aggressive and will not bite unless really provoked. They do also possess venom that will be injected due to bites. However, to humans, wolf spider bites are generally considered minor and not medically significant. Bites typically cause minor swelling and pain, but no severe complications. Antivenom is not usually needed to treat wolf spider bites.

Controversy  In March 2001, Kozak published a mini-review in the Journal of Molecular and Cellular Biology entitled \\"New Ways of Initiating Translation in Eukaryotes?\\" that resulted in push-back from the scientific community. In her publication, Kozak discussed her hesitation towards the role of internal ribosome entry sites (IRES). This was most heavily refuted by Robert Schneider, who published a response article of the same name in the same Journal in Dec. 2001. In this response, Schneider claimed that in publishing her mini-review, Kozak hoped to increase the validity of her own findings. He further stated that Kozak's publication was not up to scholarly standards and should not have been accepted into the Journal of Molecular and Cellular Biology. Later impacts of this controversy, including a suggestion that Kozak was defunded by the National Institute of Health (NIH), was explored in the blog post \\"First Human Bioinformatician Criticizes Bad Science Of NIH-Funded Bigshots Disappears\\", written in 2015.  Contributions  Along with her published work, Kozak has contributed to the scientific community with her role on the editorial board for the Journal of Molecular and Cellular Biology. She has been listed intermittently as an editor between the years 1983-1991.  Selected works  This is a selection of Kozak's work but not a complete list. .

His first military experience was in the Second Boer War (1899‚Äì1902) and with the Royal West African Frontier Force in Nigeria. During World War I, he commanded the 9th (Service) Battalion of the 107th (Ulster) Brigade in the Battle of the Somme earning him the promotion to brigadier general and command of the 119th (Welsh) Brigade in the Battle of Cambrai and Spring Offensive. After the war, he briefly served as an advisor of the newly established Lithuanian Army and commander of the Auxiliary Division of the Royal Irish Constabulary at the time of the Partition of Ireland. However, he quickly became disillusioned with the British conduct in Ireland and war in general. He became a pacifist and published several controversial autobiographical books. Biography Crozier was born in Bermuda into a family of military traditions. Both of his grandfathers served in the army and his father was a major in the Royal Scots Fusiliers. Crozier was not accepted into the military due to his short height and low weight. In 1898, seeking adventure, he traveled to Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and briefly worked at a tea plantation. At the outbreak of the Second Boer War, Crozier traveled to South Africa and joined a mounted infantry regiment as the recruitment standards had been lowered. He saw action in the British colonies of Natal and Transvaal, including the Battle of Spion Kop. He also served in the Royal West African Frontier Force in Nigeria. Military duties took their toll and Crozier started drinking. In 1905, after a bout of malaria, he returned to England and joined the Manchester Regiment and the Loyal North Lancashire Regiment. However, in 1908, he was forced to resign due to repeated dishonored cheques and became bankrupt. Discredited at home, he sailed to Canada and took up farming. That did not last long and Crozier returned home in 1912 amidst the Home Rule Crisis. In Belfast, Crozier joined the Ulster Volunteers. At the outbreak of World War I in June 1914, many of Ulster Volunteers, including Crozier, joined the British Army and formed the 36th (Ulster) Division. Crozier was appointed second in command of the 9th (Service) Battalion of the 107th (Ulster) Brigade. He traveled in Ireland, Scotland, England recruiting soldiers and officers. He also dealt with morale issues: alcohol abuse (which was also a personal issue as he was a recovering alcoholic), casual sex, sexually transmitted diseases, looting. Due to these morale issues, in November 1915, the 107th Brigade was attached to the 4th Infantry Division and Colonel Crozier was made the commander of the 9th Battalion. The battalion was sent to its first battle near Thiepval on 1 July 1916 as part of the larger Battle of the Somme. On 20 November 1916, he was promoted brigadier general and given the command of the 119th (Welsh) Brigade of the 40th Division. The brigade suffered particularly heavy losses, some half of the men, in the Battle of Estaires on 9‚Äì11 April 1918. He commanded the 119th Brigade until he was demobilized on 16 August 1919. On 19 September 1919, along with several other British officers, Crozier joined the newly established Lithuanian Army as an advisor to the General Staff during the Lithuanian Wars of Independence. An exception was made for him and he was granted the rank of major general of the Lithuanian Army. The British Foreign Office sought to organize an unified army of Lithuanian, Latvians, Estonians, and Poles commended by Crozier to drive out any remaining Germans, including the Bermontians, from the area. However, the plan failed when Lithuanians refused to allow Polish troops into their territory. On 1 March 1920, Crozier resigned his duties with the Lithuanian Army. While there was an increasing resentment of foreigners' influence within the Lithuanian Army, Crozier left on good terms with the Lithuanian government. After the brief stint in Lithuania, Crozier returned to Ireland and became commander of the Auxiliary Division of the Royal Irish Constabulary in July 1920. Crozier and his men guarded Kevin Barry before his execution. He quickly became disillusioned with the British regime and the crimes of Black and Tans, ex servicemen recruited into Royal Irish Constabulary. In February 1921, he dismissed 21 auxiliaries under his command after their raids on Trim, County Meath and Drumcondra, Dublin that left two young men dead. His superior Chief of Police in Ireland Henry Hugh Tudor ordered the auxiliaries reinstated. Crozier resigned in protest. This made it impossible for him to find other official employment. Crozier unsuccessfully ran in the 1923 general election for the Labour Party in Portsmouth Central. He turned to writing and lecturing to earn a living, though unpaid bills and dishonored cheques continued to follow him. Crozier's books were politically controversial, viewed by the Government they criticized as inaccurate, and dismissive toward Crozier as \\"discredited.\\" He became a pacifist, an active member of the Peace Pledge Union, and a speaker for the League of Nations Union. He died in 1937 in London.

The Kivist√∂ major region is the least populated‚Äîand the least densely populated‚Äîmajor region in Vantaa. History The earliest evidence of settlement in the area dates back to the early 16th century. The original inhabitants of the area are believed to have spoken Finnish, which was unique for the time. The name \\"Kivist√∂\\" was coined by them, and it is thought to be in reference to the inarable exposed granite bedrock common to the area. The existing farmland in Kivist√∂ has been in use since the 17th century, during which time the Linna Manor was constructed there. The first of the contemporary housing in the area was built in the early 1950s. The land was primarily sold by the construction firm Omakiinteist√∂ Oy, and settlers were unaware of a nearby radio station, which handled the Finnish government's international shortwave radio communications. Due to radio-frequency interference, the construction of electrical infrastructure in the area was banned, and the district spent its first years without electricity. After three years of complaints and protests, the ban was lifted, and Kivist√∂ was permitted electrical power. Protests included the construction of a roadside sign leading into district that read: \\"√ñljylamppukyl√§‚Äîjo 3 vuotta n. 200 taloa ilman s√§hk√∂√§\\" or \\"Oil Lamp Town‚Äîalready 3 years of about 200 houses without electricity\\".

The company was founded in November 2012 by Yves B√©har and Jason Johnson. On October 19, 2017, Swedish lock manufacturer Assa Abloy announced an acquisition of August Home. The deal closed in December 2017. As of July 2018, August Home had sold over one million smart locks and cameras.  Products  In May 2013, August released their first smart lock. The lock had a metal frame and was controlled using Bluetooth 4.0 with a smartphone app. As with other August door locks, the device clips on to an existing deadbolt on the inside portion of a door, still allowing the use of a traditional key. A Wi-Fi bridge was later released allowing remote access to the lock, and the use of virtual assistants (such as Amazon Alexa). In October 2015, the company debuted a suite of new products including a second generation smart lock, a smart doorbell, and a keypad for users without a phone. The company also announced August Access, a platform to let couriers from Postmates, Handy, and other services get access to the lock through a one time code. The service was later expanded to include Walmart in select U.S. markets. A HomeKit compatible version of the lock was also released the following year. A cheaper version of the smart lock was released in 2017, along with a Z-Wave compatible version designed for professional installation. The new locks also added motion sensors to know whether the door is open or closed. The August Access platform expanded to include locks for Yale and Emtek in January 2018.  Security concerns  In August 2016, a white-hat hacker showcased a vulnerability with August's one-time access codes allowing someone to use them once expired at DEF CON. The company patched the issue later that month. MIT conducted further research on potential vulnerabilities in the security of the device. They attempted accessing the device using multiple methods, none of which were successful. The methods they tested were the following: password attack, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Not Listening‚Äù attacks, changing date and time settings, snooping Bluetooth packages, decompiling the app, sniffing TCP packets, man-in-the-middle attacks, and retrieving owner permissions offline keys. Out of all of these attempts, only one was theoretically plausible. By snooping Bluetooth packets, persons with malicious intent could attempt a ‚Äúbrute force‚Äù method by guessing the ciphertext necessary to unlock the door. However, the chance of guessing this combination of bits is one in over 18.4 quintillion, and the time required to attempt all sequences is projected to be over four years.

Introduced in 2008, Joey was created by head writers Dena Higley and Victor Gialanella as the youngest child of supercouple, Steve \\"Patch\\" Johnson and Kayla Brady (Stephen Nichols and Mary Beth Evans). The role was originated by siblings Brody and Jonas‚Äîwho vacated the role in 2009 when the character was written out. Child actor, Jadon Wells appeared in the role of Joey on a recurring basis from 2012 to 2014. In 2015, the character was rapidly aged to 16 when Lastovic stepped into the role. Joey returns having skipped out on boarding school suffering from abandonment issues. It is later revealed that Joey has secretly been conspiring with Ava Vitali (Tamara Braun) to orchestrate Patch and Kayla's reunion. Unbeknownst to Joey, Ava is his father's ex-lover and has caused quite a bit of trouble for Kayla and the rest of the Brady family. Storylines 2008‚Äì2014 In February 2008, the Brady family travels to Ireland to reunite patriarch Shawn Brady (Frank Parker) with his dying sister Colleen Brady (Shirley Jones). During their trip, Kayla and Steve learn she is pregnant. On their way back to Salem, the family is involved in a plane crash that kills Shawn. It is later revealed that, Steve's deranged ex-lover Ava Vitali (Tamara Braun) is responsible for the accident. Meanwhile, Kayla is trying to save her brother Bo's life (Peter Reckell) and the stress causes pregnancy complications. Kayla goes into premature labor and gives birth to her baby boy at 26 weeks. She names him Joe after his paternal grandmother, Jo Johnson. Joe grows stronger only to be kidnapped in the summer of 2008 by Stefano DiMera (Joseph Mascolo). Joe leaves town in early 2009 with his parents. Though off screen, Joe comes back to town in 2011 when his parents separate and later divorce. Joe (Jadon Wells) first appears onscreen in late 2012 during the Christmas episodes. The character is limited to special appearances during Christmas episodes and is last seen in December 2014 during a Christmas party. 2015‚Äì2017 In August 2015, a now 16 year old, Joe, also known as Joey returns to Salem with Steve. Joey had left boarding school and found his father in New York City. Joey acts out because he resents Steve for abandoning the family. When Steve leaves town to find Joey's uncle Bo, Joey stows away on the plane. After the two have a heart to heart, where Steve recounts the story of how he and Kayla fell in love, Joey returns home. However, Joey continues causing trouble when he sabotages the electricity in the library at Salem High. Joey bonds with Theo Carver (Kyler Pettis) during Salem's bicentennial celebration and he ends up collapsing outside. Theo gets help and Joey is rushed to the hospital. Steve makes it back in time to see Joey in the hospital and Kayla reveals that there a drugs in his system. However, Joey denies ever taking drugs. While he recovers and gets released from the hospital, it is later revealed that Joey is working with Ava Vitali (Tamara Braun) to orchestrate his parents' reunion‚Äîunaware of her past. After his parents reunite, Steve and Kayla discover Ava's back in Salem and assume Joey has been working with her, but he denies it. Joey later admits to Ava that he is in love with her and he kisses her but Ava rejects him and reveals that she is dying. Kayla finds them together and demands that he stay away from her. Joey confides in Steve about his feelings for Ava and is shocked to learn Ava's past and that she may have given birth to Steve's son. Ava later kidnaps Kayla forcing Steve to cooperate with her in exchange for her release and Joey walks on them as they are about to make love. Ava forces Steve to leave town with her and gives Joey Kayla's location to free her. Though they are reunited as a family, Steve's betrayal leaves Joey bitter and angry. Development Creation and casting On November 24, 2012, Mary Beth Evans announced that child actor Jadon Wells would make his debut in the role of Joey in December 2012. Wells is the real life son of actor Dan Wells who had previously appeared on the series as Stan, the male alter ego of Sami Brady (Alison Sweeney). Jadon's appearances were limited to special Christmas episodes and he last appeared in December 2014. In March 2015, it was reported that Days of Our Lives had released two casting notices ‚Äî one of which was for the contract role of the 16 year old Joey. In April 2015, talent agency John Robert Powers San Diego announced that James Lastovic had been cast in the role of Joey Johnson with a two-year contract. Five months prior, Lastovic had quit his day job to do a play for $25 a week. \\"I had money saved up from the one commercial that I had done and thought I could use the money from that to do the play.\\" However, the play lasted longer than expected and Lastovic ran out of money. \\"I was so broke that I looked forward to the dinner scene\\" so he could eat. Fortunately, Lastovic booked Days as the play ended. Lastovic had actually auditioned for the series three years prior. While he wasn't sure for what role he auditioned for Lastovic revealed, \\"I had the same exact sides when I read for Joey!\\" Lastovic filmed his first scenes in March 2015 and made his debut on August 28, 2015. During the audition process, Lastovic watched a few episodes of the series to prepare. Casting director Marnie Saitta later informed the young actor that he'd be working with two \\"adored\\" veterans in Mary Beth Evans (Kayla) and Stephen Nichols (Patch). \\"I looked them up online and found some of their scenes from the 1980s. I saw how good they were and I was instantly excited to get to work with them\\" Lastovic revealed. After he booked the role, Lastovic admitted that he got hooked on the show when he went back to watch Patch and Kayla's love story. Teen years (2015‚Äì2017) The production team wanted to establish a teenage set in time for the show's 50th anniversary and Lastovic's casting was just the first in a slew of castings. Executive producer Ken Corday said \\"Joey will be giving Patch the 'rebel' a little of his own medicine!\\" Lastovic was very nervous about playing such an important role but Mary Beth Evans invited him over to her home and greeted him with freshly baked cookies. \\"Seeing Mary Beth holding that plate of cookies, I immediately felt that motherly connection.\\" He credited Evans and Stephen Nichols for making him comfortable. Lastovic also founded a mentor in costar Casey Moss who had joined the series two years prior in the similar role of troubled teenager JJ Deveraux‚ÄîJoey's cousin. \\"I think he could see a little bit of himself in me\\" Lastovic said. Lastovic later admitted that his nerves worked well for his first scenes as Joey had recently run away from boarding school -- \\"he was supposed to be nervous.\\" So much is changing Joey at the time of his return. \\"He's just beginning to experience all these new emotions, so he's feeling a little lost.\\" Joey's needing his parents helps bring Patch and Kayla back together after years of estrangement. A promo for the show's 50th anniversary in November 2015 revealed that Joey is secretly conspiring with his father's ex-lover and family rival Ava Vitali (Tamara Braun) to help reunite his parents.  Departure  In March 2017, after a cryptic tweet by Lastovic's mother, Lucienne, it was rumored that the actor's contract with the series had not been renewed. On Wednesday, August 16, the rumors were proven through by Lastovic himself in an Instagram post, he last aired on August 22 when the character going to prison for Ava's murder. Reception Omar White-Nobles of TVSource Magazine praised the decision to age Joey along with the other characters in time for the show's 50th anniversary. \\"I may be 29, but I'm a fan of the multi-generational aspect of the continuing narrative.\\" Lastovic's debut was \\"highly anticipated\\" as it coincided with the onscreen return of Stephen Nichols as Patch. Soap Opera Digest included the actor in its list of the \\"Hottest Newcomers\\" for the year 2015. Daytime Confidential also listed Lastovic as number five on their own list of the \\"Top 20 Soap Opera Newcomers of 2015.\\" The blog praised Lastovic for his portrayal and said Joey's habit of acting out and causing grief for his mother \\"helps to further ground the Johnsons as Salem's relatable, working central family.\\" Omar Nobles said Joey return provided Kayla with \\"a greater purpose and more attention in just a few short weeks than the four years since she returned to the show.\\" He continued, \\"That's smart planning. That's smart creative.\\" The website also praised Lastovic as being one of the strongest of the new younger actors.

Individuals with DMD often experience difficulties in areas of self-care, productivity and leisure. This is related to the effects of the disorder, such as decreased mobility; decreased strength and postural stability; progressive deterioration of upper-limb function; and contractures. Occupational and physical therapists address an individual's limitations using meaningful occupations and by grading the activity, by using different assessments and resources such as splinting, bracing, manual muscle testing (MMT), ROM, postural intervention and equipment prescription. Orthoses Splints, also referred to as orthoses, are designed to maintain or improve ROM, prevent deformity, and improve function. Splints help to support and keep limbs stretched, which delays or prevents the onset of contractures that commonly affect the knees, hips, feet, elbows, wrists and fingers. Ankle foot orthoses (AFOs) can be used during sleep or during the day. The purpose of this is to keep the foot from pointing downward and sustain the stretch of the Achilles tendon. Maintaining the length of the tendo-Achilles, also referred to as the gastrocnemius-soleus complex, is extremely important for walking. Knee ankle foot orthoses (KAFOs) are also used for walking or for standing and can be used to prolong ambulation or help delay the onset of lower limb contractures. Orthotic devices have also been suggested to help people that need mechanical support stand upright.  Standing devices  Devices to help a person with duchenne muscular dystrophy stand are a common treatment approach. Orthotic devices are used (as discussed above) and also specific standing devices such as standing frames, standing wheelchairs, and tables that have a tilt function. Standing devices are designed to stabilize a person so that they can bear weight and be standing upright safely, even if they are not able to stand on their own. Studies to determine the benefits of standing devices are few and no high-quality randomized trials have been performed. Proposed benefits of standing as a therapy include improved lengthening of the muscles, improvements in range of motion of hips and lower limbs, the potential for a delay in the start of scoliosis, improvements in bone density, improvements in muscle spasms, improved function of the respiratory system and voice, reduced pressure on the skin, and improved sleep and overall well being. Manual muscle testing (MMT) and range of motion (ROM) MMT is used to evaluate muscular strength, whereas goniometry or ROM tests measure movement around a joint. These tests indicate need for intervention such as passive and active ROM, strengthening and splinting. Passive ROM combined with the use of night splints can significantly improve tendo-Achilles contractures. Seating and positioning Proper seating is essential to prevent spinal curvatures. Severe scoliosis is common in DMD and can interfere with sitting, sleeping, and breathing. A wheelchair that is fitted appropriately accounts for frame size, type of seat, lumbar support and cushioning to avoid pressure ulcers. It should be equipped with other mechanical devices, such as tilt ability, in order to provide comfort and to protect the skin. Power wheelchairs are indicated for most clients who can no longer ambulate, as they do not have enough upper extremity strength to propel a manual wheelchair independently. DMD affects many people in their adolescence, so it is crucial for rehab therapists to be conscious that significant development may occur during this time. Without proper seating and postural support throughout development, deformation may occur. This could then result in dysfunctional positioning. It is important for rehab therapists to re-evaluate the fit of an individual‚Äôs wheelchair as often as every year during adolescence. Adaptive equipment and devices There are many alternate mobility options, positioning aids and other equipment that rehab therapists may prescribe. These include walkers or quad-canes, which can be used for individuals who are able ambulate to reduce the risk of falling. In addition, transfer boards, mechanical lifts and specific transferring education are important because fractures have been seen to occur during transfers as a result of osteoporosis. Handheld shower heads and bath benches are indicated to enable individuals to manage their own self-care needs as much as possible. Individuals who are able to bear weight and take a few steps may utilize commode chairs, thus giving them the ability to visit the toilet independently. To complement an individualized wheelchair, an occupational therapist may also consider prescribing a hospital bed, pressure-relieving mattresses and foam wedges for proper positioning to prevent pressure skin ulcers, contractures and deformities. Specialized trays, input devices and software may also be prescribed to facilitate computer use. Social skills development Along with physical difficulties, individuals with DMD may have social issues that an occupational therapist can assist them in overcoming. Group sessions or individualized programs that focus on coping mechanisms for depression are examples of what an occupational therapist can facilitate. Self-esteem building for individuals of all ages is an essential part of ensuring that a high quality of life is achieved. Occupational therapy intervention can play an essential role in supporting the development of social skills through group interactions and other life experiences. An occupational therapist can use a variety of psychosocial frameworks for developing strategies and techniques for individuals to utilize, which will help them work through various psychosocial issues they may be experiencing. Sexual health Sexuality is a topic that many people feel uncomfortable discussing and thus may be overlooked by health care professionals. An occupational therapist will educate individuals with DMD on safe and effective ways to experience their sexual life. Such education can include various forms of sex as well as numerous positions that they would be able to perform. Employment Gaining and maintaining employment can be difficult for individuals with DMD. An occupational therapist may collaborate with an individual, employer and case manager to ensure that the individual‚Äôs work environment is as enabling and accessible as possible. By adapting the physical work environment, the social environment and the work requirements and guidelines, an individual can maintain meaningful employment as well as be as an asset to his or her employer. This may not only impact the individual‚Äôs perceived self-efficacy but also his or her financial well-being. Home modifications If it is a priority of the client, maintaining independence is often a main focus of occupational therapy interventions. Within the home, there are numerous obstacles that may prevent a client from being as independent as possible. Home modifications and adaptations are something that an occupational therapist can assist with. Such modifications may include: railings for safe mobility and transfers, lifts, adapted kitchens that are accessible for wheelchairs and bathroom modifications such as raised toilet seats or modified baths. Other examples are adaptive equipment for playing computer and video games, supports for biking and adaptations for fishing rods. Leisure A recreational or occupational therapist can support individuals with DMD to find leisure activities in which it is meaningful for them to take part. Accommodations and adaptations can be made to enhance participation. Advocacy In order to create a successful therapeutic relationship, it is important to coordinate with family members, friends and other social resources to ensure that a person with DMD has both physical and emotional support. An occupational therapist can act as an advocate for his or her client and can educate those around him or her regarding information about the illness, supports, resources and other concerns. An occupational therapist can also provide his or her client with the tools to learn how to provide his or her own advocacy.

The series depicts the desperate battle between humanity and a race of omnivorous monsters in a futuristic post-apocalyptic world. As of February 2019, the franchise has six games (including three revamped games), several manga and light novel adaptations, soundtracks, and an anime adaptation. Gameplay The gameplay consists of players embarking on various missions to hunt specific monsters. The primary goal of the game is to complete missions by successfully taking out powerful monsters, retrieving their parts through \\"devouring\\", breaking a certain body part of an Aragami or receiving them as rewards, and using them as materials to craft or upgrade parts for the God Arc. Additionally, players may also gather minerals, medical kits, and various materials to improve their weapons. Players can freely switch between three forms: \\"Blade Form\\" for close combat, \\"Gun Form\\" for long-range shooting, and \\"Shield Form\\" for protection against attacks during \\"Blade Form\\". One notable feature of the franchise is the ability to \\"eat\\" the enemy Aragami during combat with the God Arc's \\"Predator Form\\". Successfully doing so will enter a state called \\"Burst Mode\\", granting players increased speed, attack power, and special access to a limited set of \\"Aragami Bullets\\", which can be used against the Aragami. Another notable feature is the Bullet Editor, which allow players to customize their own unique bullets. These bullets can also be used by the player during missions. Players are able to customize the equipment in their God Arc, such as its \\"Blades\\", \\"Shield\\", \\"Gun\\", and \\"Control Unit\\". \\"Control Units\\" are mods that can be equipped to the God Arc, giving status buffs upon entering \\"Burst Mode\\".

An MMORPG for Android and iPhone titled, God Eater Online was released on February 15, 2017. Setting The God Eater franchise takes place in the year 2071, several years after the emergence of the . The Aragami are race of vicious creatures made of a cluster of \\"Oracle Cells\\", single-celled organisms that can consume anything and take on its attributes, that devours most of the Earth's resources and much of humanity to the point of near-extinction. Coming in different forms, they are invincible against any conventional weaponry, even capable of absorbing large quantities of nuclear energy into their own, until a Finnish pharmaceutical company known as created a series of biomechanical hybrid weapons called that can kill the Aragami, as well as selecting those who can wield such weapons. These individuals are then called . Various branches of Fenrir also have a sanctuary called the \\"Outer Ghetto\\", in which the rich, as well as those who yet to qualify as a God Eater and their families, resides, but due to overpopulation, the company limits the capacity of those who lives inside the Ghetto. Terminology Aragami First reported sometime in the year 2050, the Aragami is a race of mysterious beasts that had consumed a majority of the Earth's resources and pushed mankind to the brink of extinction. Made of hundreds of thousands of \\"Oracle Cells\\", the Aragami can consume any given object/organism, as well as any smaller Aragami, and take on its attributes, allowing any individual Aragami to \\"evolve\\" beyond its evolutionary chain. In addition there are, newer evolved species of Aragami starting to resemble humans. Impervious to any modern firearms, as well as any form of weaponized energy, the God Arc is the only weapon capable of \\"cutting through\\" an Aragami's \\"core\\", effectively killing it. God Arc Known as in the Japanese release, the God Arc is a series of biomechanical weapons created by Fenrir as a means to combat the Aragami. Usually looks like a mix between a sword, a gun, a shield and a mass of black Aragami flesh, each of these God Arcs are controlled by an artificial Aragami core embedded near the grip area, allowing the God Eaters to control these weapons to their fullest extent. In other words, every God Arc is a man-made Aragami that can be controlled by humans. In the early installment of the games, they are two types of God Arcs: the \\"Old-type\\", in which a God Arc is designed for either close-quarter combat or long-ranged combat; and the \\"New-Type\\", which can freely switch between forms. So far, the God Arc has five known forms: *Blade Form: A form normally used for close-quarter combat, it simply makes use of the God Arc's blade part to attack the Aragami in close-range. *Gun Form: A form used for long-ranged assaults, it utilizes the gun part of the God Arc to shoot the Aragami. *Shield Form: A form that can be accessed in Blade Form, this deploys a shield to protect the God Eater from enemy attacks. *Predator Form: A form that can be accessed in Blade Form, this form produces a massive pair of jaws from the God Arc to \\"devour\\" the Aragami, bestowing them with a powered state called \\"Burst Mode\\", which greatly enhances the God Eater's power and abilities. This form is also used for salvaging cores and materials from fallen Aragami, which are essential for crafting new items and equipment. *Blood Rage: A form introduced in God Eater 2 Rage Burst that can be accessed only by the player. In this form, the God Arc temporarily unlocks its Restraining Frames, producing a crystalline \\"wing\\" on the God Eater's back, giving them invincibility and increased speed and attack, as well as capable of dashing infinitely. Unfortunately, it only lasts roughly 30 seconds, and it requires a portion of the Awakening Gauge to be activated again. However, not everyone can wield the God Arc, as each of them are connected to a specific God Eater. Also, if a God Eater touches someone else's God Arc apart from their own, they will get \\"devoured\\" and killed, or in a rare case, turns them into an Aragami. God Eater God Eaters are individuals capable of wielding the God Arc to fight the Aragami, and serving as Fenrir's main line of defense. Chosen through a series of aptitude test, the selected subjects are then painfully equipped with a bracelet containing the Bias Factor, a substance that determines what the Aragami should and should not \\"eat\\", as well as protecting them from getting devoured by their assigned God Arc. The bracelet also grants super-strength and enhanced speed. If the bracelet is damaged and/or removed, the invading Oracle Cells from the God Arcs will gradually mutate the God Eater into an Aragami. If this happens, they can only be killed by their own God Arcs.

Senator Morrill also served as a trustee of the university from 1865 until 1898. The building was constructed during 1906-07 to serve as the home of the UVM Agriculture Department and the Agricultural Experiment Station.

History  University of Vermont, Morrill Hall, circa 1907 Morrill Hall was constructed with a State appropriation of $60,000, which passed in the Vermont House under bill H.76 on October 27, 1904 (with a vote of 170 Yeas and 54 Nays),Journal of The House of Representatives ~ State of Vermont: in the Senate on November 11, 1904 (with a vote of 23 Yeas and 2 Nays),Journal of The Senate ~ State of Vermont: and was signed by the Governor on November 15, 1904. Morrill Hall was dedicated on December 11, 1907. It was the first building ever to be constructed on the UVM campus using state funds.  Land use history  The site where Morrill Hall currently stands was part of a 22-acre farm originally owned by Moses Catlin. The land was passed to Catlin from Ira Allen in November 1798 as a result of a levy originating from a federal judgement against Allen.City of Burlington: Land Records ‚Äì Vol 2, 1798‚Äì1850 Catlin had filed a lawsuit on the behalf of his wife, Lucinda Catlin (n√©e Allen) for mismanagement of her late father's estate. Lucinda Catlin was the daughter of Heman Allen and niece to Ira and Ethan Allen. 1798 map of lots owned by Ira Allen, which became the future site of Morrill Hall In 1806, Catlin built the original house on the property, which is today known as the \\"Johnson House\\".Johnson House: Timeline of UVM Campus Architecture, University of Vermont website (accessed 2015) The property was then sold to John Johnson (Vermont's third surveyor- general)\\"Famous Vermonters\\", Vermont Geographic Alliance, http://academics.smcvt.edu/vtgeographic/ Accessed July 29, 2015. in 1809. Johnson was in charge of surveying the northeastern boundary between Canada and the U.S. (circa 1816). He had also served as the architect and master builder of the original college building (i.e. the 1802 predecessor to the present day \\"Old Mill\\" building). After it was destroyed by fire in 1824, Johnson designed much of its replacement, as well as other buildings on the UVM campus (e.g. Grasse Mount in 1804, and Pomeroy Hall in 1828).Timeline of UVM Campus Architecture, University of Vermont website (accessed 2015) Johnson's son Edwin F. Johnson passed the property to his son-in-law Joseph Dana Allen, who then passed it to his son John Johnson Allen (UVM class of 1862). In 1906, the site known as the \\"Allen Homestead\\" was sold to the University Trustees by J.J. Allen (for a sum of $30,000 or $32,000)The History of University of Vermont Buildings: 1800‚Äì1947 for the purpose of the building's construction.  Construction  To make way for the construction of Morrill Hall during 1906, the barn and a line fence on the property were demolished, while the original \\"Johnson House\\" was moved to 590 Main Street (i.e. the current location of the Dudley H. Davis Student Center). In 2005, the Johnson House was again moved to the opposite side of the street, on the southwestern corner of University Heights and Main Street. Corner stone of Morrill Hall, University of Vermont The corner stone of the Morrill Hall was laid on June 26, 1906 as part of that year's commencement exercises. A copper box was placed inside the corner stone containing a number of historical documents causal to the building's construction (e.g. the Morrill Bills of 1862 and 1890, the Hatch Act of 1887, the Adams Act of 1906, State legislation addressing the State Agriculture College and Experiment Station, the 18th report of the Vermont Experiment station, et al.) by Gov. Charles J. Bell.UVM Historic Preservation Program, \\"University Green Area Heritage Study\\", Smith, Melissa, 2011 The Champlain Manufacturing Company of Burlington, VT served as the construction contractor, with oversight by a member of the UVM Board of Trustees, G.S. Fassett. Senator Morrill's son contributed an additional $1,000 for the two granite pillars at the building's facade. The contractor was said to have lost about $10,000 on the project and the University spent untold thousands more to equip the building. During this time, the first floor facilities included; the offices of the Dean and Director, Professor of Horticulture, Stenographer, office and laboratory of the dairy husbandman, a library, classrooms, and the agricultural chemistry and horticultural laboratories. The upper floor facilities included; class and lecture rooms, the chemistry laboratories of the Experiment Station, and the Soil Physics laboratory. The basement operated as a dairy facility (including a creamery), served as storage for farm machinery, and housed a mail room, and the power and heating plant. The majority of the original interior partitions were made of painted brick, where some of the other partitions were made of brown ash. The ceilings were constructed entirely out of steel. The building was equipped with an elaborate ventilation system for its time, and was heated using steam. In 1911, three 60' x 20' green houses and a steam-powered head house (costing $7,000) were built in back of Morrill Hall, which provided for teaching and experimentation in horticulture and plant physiology, and replaced the outmoded 1891 greenhouse facility formerly located on the university's farm.UVM Catalog, 1940‚Äì41, page 51.  Historic occupancy  Dairy operation in Morrill Hall basement, early 1900s When Morrill Hall had first opened in 1907, it housed the Departments of Agriculture, Horticulture, Forestry, and the University Extension Service, which administered a total of 60 students and 10 faculty. Within a decade the facility was already considered to be overcrowded. The number of faculty, staff and students in 1916 was reported to have increased to 125 regular students (with an additional 50 students during the winter months), and 32 faculty and staff utilizing the offices and laboratories. UVM Extension Service \\"Bumper Crops\\" passing by Morrill Hall, 1908 By 1925, the attendance of the College of Agriculture had \\"considerably more than tripled\\" since 1907. During that year, after the passing of the Purnell Act (which had significantly increased federal endowments for all 48 of the nation's agricultural experiment stations), the building's overcrowded conditions began to be addressed when the University moved the offices and research laboratories of the dairy department into the renovated \\"old medical college building\\" (known today as Pomeroy Hall) located diagonally across the street from Morrill Hall. In 1932, the Agricultural Extension Service offices were moved to the former residence of a UVM Professor, Josiah W. Votey at 481 Main Street. In 1946, the basement was installed with a foods laboratory, and a new milk laboratory replaced the storage area and mail room (that was relocated to 481 Main Street). However, by the mid to late 1940s, the Home Economics department \\"had taken over much of the building\\", until the Bertha M. Terrill Home Economics Building (i.e. Terrill Hall) was constructed in 1950‚Äì51.  Professor Bertha M. Terrill and the Home Economics department  Professor Bertha Terrill in 1909 A testament to her efficacy in establishing the Department of Home Economics (more recently known as the Department of Leadership and Developmental Sciences) over the course of her 31-year tenure, Bertha Mary Terrill (1870‚Äì1968) initiated the program during the fall semester of 1909 as the sole instructor with only a single classroom located in the basement of Morrill Hall. With a $1,000 contribution raised by university alumnae, Terrill converted the former storage room into her classroom and laboratory, shoveling out the plaster herself. The first woman to join the faculty in the university's history during that year, Terrill was soon appointed as the Dean of Women. In 1911, an additional instructor and a furnished room within Morrill Hall was added to the department. Terrill's introduction of \\"practical education\\" for women within her curriculum (e.g. Chemistry, Physiology, Bacteriology, which were prerequisites for most of her courses) was considered to be highly controversial among higher-education institutions of the day. Later reflecting that she may not have had the courage to come to Vermont had she known beforehand how much prejudice against women she would encounter, Terrill nevertheless had a successful academic career, which included; the authorship of a book, serving as a charter member of the American Home Economics Association, and the co-founding of the Burlington Community Center (today known as the Sara M. Holbrook Community Center) in Burlington, Vermont in November 1937. Taking an interest in a number of humanitarian efforts, Professor Terrill had introduced educational programs to people in rural areas of the State to improve nutrition, consumer practices, and sanitation. While undertaking this work, she had urged many farm girls to enroll in the university. A notable colleague (and former student), Mary Jane Simpson (1888-1977) had once remarked; \\"No one ever knew how many girls Bertha helped finance out of her own pocket.\\" Having expanded the department to six full-time professors and three research professors, Professor Terrill was awarded and honorary Doctorate of Science in Home Economics upon her retirement in 1940.  Modern renovations and occupancy  In 1967, the University considered a $540,000 proposal to renovate the building. Some of the improvements considered were; removal of the large main \\"decorative\\" stairway and replacing it with two smaller fireproof stairways; converting the attic into a laboratory; and installing a mechanical ventilation system, low-hung ceilings, an elevator, and a handicap-accessible ramp at the front door. Although the proposal was not accepted, an elevator was eventually installed providing access to all four levels of the building. Around 1992‚Äì93 (possibly sooner), the Vermont Center for Geographic Information (VCGI), an \\"Affiliate Organization\\" of UVM at the time, was located on the upper floor of Morrill Hall. In 1999, their offices were relocated to the first floor of the Johnson House.

Community Development and Applied Economics, and a Master of Public Administration. Also housed in Morrill Hall are; the Center for Rural Studies, the Community Outreach Partnership Center (COPC), the Office of Community-University Partnerships & Service Learning (CUPS), and the Vermont Regional Office of the Peace Corps.  Architecture  The architect of the building was Charles Wyman Buckham, the son of the 11th University of Vermont president Matthew Henry Buckham.Former Presidents of the University of Vermont Office of the President, University of Vermont website, 2015 An 1891 graduate of the University of Vermont, Charles Buckham continued his architectural studies at the National Academy of Design (currently known as the National Academy Museum & School) in New York City, Columbia University, and at institutions in Paris. He was the designer of the State Office Building in Montpelier, Vermont, among a number of other notable buildings in Vermont, New York City, and Minnesota. Marble stairway of the first floor front entrance of UVM Morrill Hall Morrill Hall is a three-story building (including a basement) built using rusticated brick with terra-cotta trim. From a centered and (generally) west-facing, semi-portico structure extends the main entrance, which is topped with a pediment adorned with the Great Seal of Vermont. The entrance way is adjoined by two 23' 3\\" granite columns; each weighing about thirteen tons and measuring a diameter of 2' 10\\" at the base, and 2' 5\\" at the summit.

Despite being from the minor nobility, he entered the French Royal Army as a cadet at the age of 12 because of his family's poverty. He fought in the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War, becoming a colonel in 1785 and retiring two years later. Voltaire lent him the money needed to recover the Deprez family property. He was elected to the Estates General as a nobleman in 1789. After being promoted to lieutenant general he led a division at Valmy in 1792. He became commander of the Army of the Rhine and Army of the Western Pyrenees. Imprisoned during the Reign of Terror, he was released and restored to his former rank but retired in 1796. Career Deprez-Crassier was promoted mar√©chal de camp (brigadier general) on 1 March 1791. While leading 600 troops, he fought a skirmish with the Prussians at Fontoy on 19 August 1792. His detachment consisted of two companies of grenadiers and five squadrons of Chasseurs √† Cheval. His soldiers encountered a superior force of five squadrons of the Wolffradt Hussar Regiment and were defeated with a loss of 200 killed and wounded plus 24 men captured. Nevertheless, he was promoted to lieutenant general on 5 September 1792. During the Battle of Valmy on 20 September 1792 Deprez-Crassier led a detachment in Fran√ßois Christophe Kellermann's Army of the Centre. Under his command were the 1st Battalion of the 1st Line Infantry Regiment, one grenadier battalion, three squadrons each of the 3rd Hussar and 1st Chasseurs √† Cheval Regiments and two squadrons of the 4th Dragoon Regiment. The day before the battle Kellermann sent the Advance Guard under Deprez-Crassier forward from his camp at Dommartin-la-Planchette toward Somme- Bionne. At his position at the La Lune tavern, Deprez-Crassier was joined the next morning by the Reserve under Jean-Baptiste Cyrus de Valence. As the Prussians advanced on his position Kellermann decided to move his main force to the mound of Valmy under cover of a morning fog and the forces of Deprez- Crassier and Valence. During this time three squadrons of Prussian hussars blundered into the covering force and were repulsed. As the Prussians brought up their artillery to fire on the La Lune position, Kellermann established his defensive lines at Valmy. Coming under fire, Deprez-Crassier and Valence fell back to take post near the hamlet of Orbeval on the left of the main position at Valmy. At this time Charles Fran√ßois Dumouriez sent forward nine battalions from the Army of the North to reinforce Kellermann's left flank, 16 battalions to buttress his right and another 12 battalions and six squadrons to form a reserve. When the fog lifted the Prussian generals were surprised to see the French army arrayed in great strength before them. The famous artillery duel followed, after which the Prussian commander Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel declined to press home the attack.

China does not allow for the extradition of its own nationals.  Extradition from China  China currently grants extradition to both states it maintains extradition treaties with and states that assure reciprocity. Extradition from China can be sought if: (1) the conduct indicated in the request for extradition constitutes an offense according to the laws of both China and the Requesting State and (2) the request for extradition is made for the purpose of instituting criminal proceedings, the offence indicated in the request for extradition is, under the laws of both China and the Requesting State, punishable by a fixed term of imprisonment for one year or more or by any other heavier criminal penalty. Additionally, provision (2) grants states the ability to request extradition when persons have already been convicted, but have a remaining sentence of at least six months at the time of the request. All requests for extradition are required to be made via diplomatic channels using a handwritten application. Along with the application, foreign states must also include a warrant of arrest, the necessary evidence to convict said person, and photographs, fingerprints, or other material that might be used to verify the identity of said persons. In cases of extradition to execute a sentence such as granted in provision (2), foreign states must also provide a copy of the written verdict that convicted said person. Additionally, all copies of the aforementioned materials must be accompanied by transliterations in Chinese. Foreign states must also make assurances that they will not investigate extradited persons for any criminal offenses other than those they have been extradited for. Additionally, foreign states must assure they will not extradite extradited persons to a third state unless by the extradited persons' own consent. Following receipt of the request, it is examined by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs where, if it is found to be in accordance with Chinese extradition law, it is passed on to the Higher People's Court where it is ruled whether the People's Republic of China will honour the extradition request.

Pope John Paul II beatified her on 27 September 1992 and canonized her on 1 October 2000. Life Mar√≠a Josefa Sancho de Guerra was born on 7 September 1842 in Spain as the eldest daughter of Bernabe Sancho and Petra de Guerra. She was baptized the following day. She received the sacrament of Confirmation on 10 August 1844. At the age of seven, her father died and her mother took charge of her spiritual development. Her mother also sent her to her relatives in Madrid for further education. At the age of 18, she returned to Vitoria to announce to her mother her desire to join a monastery, responding to her vocation, repeatedly telling her: \\"I was born with a religious vocation\\". She joined the Institute of the Servants of Mary at the age of 18 but by the time she approached her time for profession, she was aware of uncertainties about her vocation. Telling various confessors, each told her that she had misinterpreted her vocation. After a brief period, she decided to leave the order to establish her own congregation. She established a new congregation known as the Servants of Jesus of Charity in 1871 with a focus on the care of children, the sick, the elderly and the poor. She was its first Mother Superior. At that point, she selected as her new name \\"Mar√≠a Josefa of the Heart of Jesus\\". She died on 20 March 1912. Her remains were transferred in 1926 from the local cemetery to the motherhouse of the institute. Her institute expanded after her death with over 100 houses in many different countries such as Chile, Italy, France, Portugal, Argentina, Paraguay, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Mexico, the Philippines and the Dominican Republic. Canonization The sainthood process commenced in Bilbao with the opening of a local process in 1951 which finished in 1954. The formal introduction of the cause came on 7 January 1972 which granted her the title of Servant of God. The Positio - documentation on her life of heroic virtue - was submitted to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in 1984. Pope John Paul II approved the findings and conferred upon her the title of Venerable on 7 September 1989. The miracle required for her beatification was investigated and ratified on 8 June 1990 leading to papal approval on 13 June 1992. She was beatified on 27 September 1992. The second miracle that was needed for her canonization was also investigated after her beatification and was ratified on 13 October 1995.

Schmutzler was also a political activist who campaigned against the Single-Party dictatorship of the German Democratic Republic. He hit the headlines as a victim of one of the show trials that proliferated in East Germany during the 1950s. Life Schmutzler began university-level study of Pedagogy and Philosophy in 1933 before becoming, in 1939, a Primary school teacher. War ended in May 1945 and in 1946 he began to study Theology, concluding these studies in 1951. During this time he was also, in 1946/47, a local councilor in Markranst√§dt, a small town a short distance outside Leipzig. From 1954 till 1957 he was the pastor to the Evangelical Lutheran community at St. Peter's on the south side of Leipzig, and also Student Pastor for the city's evangelical student community. In this capacity he was highly critical of the prevailing official ideology in what had, by now, become a Soviet sponsored one-Party dictatorship. On 5 April 1957 officers of the Ministry for State Security (Stasi) arrested Schmutzler in Leipzig, at his apartment in the Alfred K√§stner StreetAlfred-K√§stner-Stra√üe 11, Leipzig After less than eight months of investigative detention he faced trial: he was found guilty of \\"incitement to boycott\\" (\\"Boykotthetze\\") and was sentenced to a further five years imprisonment. In the event he was released on 18 February 1961, having spent the intervening period in the prison at Torgau. The trial was recorded by the authorities and given wide publicity, which was a feature of East German show trials during the 1950s. A couple of weeks after the trial's conclusion, extracts from the judge's questioning of Schmutzler appeared in Der Spiegel, West Germany's widely respected (and widely read) news magazine. As Spiegel freely admitted, its record of the trial transcript was selective, and highlighted only the most \\"loaded\\" moments of the interrogation conducted on behalf of the East German Communist authorities. The transcript publication nevertheless gave to many of those who might have preferred not to know of the matter, a timely insight into the contemporary show-trial culture operating across the internal political (and subsequently physical) frontier that since 1949 had divided the two Germanys. From 1961 Schmutzler was the pastor at St. James's church in nearby Dresden. Starting in the middle of 1968, Dr. Schmutzler also lectured on both philosophy and on Education at the Theological Seminary in Leipzig. He retired in 1981 from his Dresden pastorate, and was able to relocate to West Berlin. In November 1989 the breach by protestors of the Berlin Wall, and the subsequent discovery that Soviet troops had received no instructions to suppress the rising tide of street protest by force, triggered a succession of events that led to the demise of the German Democratic Republic as a stand- alone state and, formally in October 1990, German reunification. Siegfried Schmutzler was formally rehabilitated, politically, on 9 July 1991. In 1996 he was honoured with the national Order of Merit and on 17 September 1997 the city council awarded him one of the first Honour Medals of the City of Leipzig. Shortly after he died, at the age of 88, the city council passed a resolution, on 18 November 2004, to rename a street in the Gohlis-South district as \\"Schmutzlerstra√üe\\" (\\"Schmutzler Street\\").

History ƒåesenj hydroelectric plant in Brod A wooden bridge was built across the Sava north of Brod in 1844, eliminating its function as a ford. The bridge was destroyed during high waters in 1907 and replaced by an iron bridge in 1910. Ignacij ƒåesenj established a hydroelectric plant in Brod in 1908, which provided employment for part of the local population. Brod had only 16 houses before the Second World War, and it grew rapidly after the war. During the twentieth century many small crafts developed in Brod, including furniture-making, cooperage, automobile bodywork, electrical installation, galvanizing, stove-making, and other activities.

For example, when we see an organ through inverted binoculars, it looks smaller than it really is, which may reduce the pain felt from that organ. Ten patients whose right arms were suffering from chronic pain that was intensified by movement were asked to move their arms while their visual perceptions of those arms were altered. They first used binoculars that magnified how their bodies appeared, and then used inverted binoculars that instead reduced their sizes. They also asked to rate the pain they felt when doing so. The larger the limbs appeared, the more pain was felt. Magnifying and minimizing with binoculars can even change the extent of swelling.

Summary  The book centers upon the personal lives of the wives of the Mercury Seven astronauts who piloted the six manned space flights of Project Mercury between May 1961 and May 1963. The women were frequently the focus of public attention and also came into contact with influential people such as Jackie Kennedy. This rise to celebrity status would take its toll on these women and they ended up turning to each other for solace, calling themselves the Astronaut Wives Club. As a result, they formed the Astronaut Wives Club and met regularly to discuss their daily lives and various issues that only the others would truly understand.

Opened in 1907 as Dallas Hospital, it is operated by Salem Health, which also operates Salem Hospital. WVH is the only hospital in Polk County. History Started as Dallas Hospital in 1907, it moved in 1909 to Oak Street. In 1912, four local doctors raised money to build a two-storey, $13,000 hospital that opened in 1914 on Uglow Street. Mark Hatfield was born at the hospital in 1922, as was Johnnie Ray in 1927. In 1964, Tony Branson bought the facility with a silent partner before selling it to California-based Sedco Northwest, Inc. in 1971. Sedco built a new hospital, opening it in 1973 as Polk Community Hospital. Sedco later merged into Hyatt Medical Enterprises, which sold what was then known as Valley Community Hospital to American Medical International (AMI) in 1981. AMI sold the facility in 1983 to Nu-Med, which in turn sold it in 1994 to a local non-profit, VCH. The local non-profit sold the hospital for $2.4 million in 1999 to Salem Hospital, with the non-profit then leasing it back. Salem Hospital remodeled the facility in 2000, which was then renamed as West Valley Hospital in July 2002 as it joined what became Salem Health when it bought the entire hospital. The hospital regained use of the city's aquatic center for physical therapy in 2003. A new wing was added in 2003 at a cost of $1.4 million. A doctor who worked as a contract emergency department physician at the hospital was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2005 due to claims he used an unapproved Botox substitute at his own clinics. In September 2012, the hospital finished renovations on the operating rooms. The hospital faced losing its designation as a critical access hospital in 2013. Details WVH is licensed for 15 beds, but as of 2014 only had 6 beds available. Services at the critical access hospital include an emergency department, surgical, ophthalmology, imaging, gynecology, lab services, orthopedics, urology, and podiatry, among others. For 2013, the hospital had a total of 173 discharges, with 536 patient days, and 12,074 emergency department visits. The hospital does not have inpatient surgeries nor a maternity department. For 2013, the hospital had $20 million for net patient revenue, earned $987,000 in net income, and provided $2.1 million in charity care.

Officially called Bamunkumbit, it is also referred to by the indigenes as Mankong. History Mangeh villages believe that Mangeh had five children, two sons (Tuningmungwa and Chengfong) and three daughters (Byiae, Vhenji and Mekheng). The eldest Tunigmungwa succeeded their father and formed Bambalang while his brother Chengfong established the Bamunka village whereas Byiae formed Bamali, Vhenji formed Bafanji and Mekheng the Bamunkumbit village. Bambalang and Bamunka were descendants of the males (sons of Mangeh) while Bafanji, Bamunkumbit and Bamali are the descendants of the daughters. These five villages have formed the Mangeh Family Association to maintain peace and unity amongst themselves to ensure progress of all. These villages have no defined boundary between them because they know that they are one. Mangeh branches are found all over the country and abroad. Location As one of the five villages that make up Balikumbat Subdivision under Ngo-Ketunjia Division, Bamunkumbit shares a common boundary with Bafanji, Baligashu, Balikumbat, Baligansin (all in the North West Region) and Bamenyan (in the West Region). https://geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-4439483&fid;=1364&c;=cameroonhttps://www.facebook.com/macuda.mankong Religion More than half of Bamunkumbit villagers, particularly the elderly, are traditionalists. They hold so firmly to their native beliefs and the worship of the kwifor. The Kwifor is the secret and supreme authority believed to be governing the village spiritually whereas the Fon is physical leader who governs the village. All villagers, with the Fon inclusive, are expected to be submissive to the Kwifor. The minority Mbororo community of Bamunkumbit are Muslims and they worship Alla. There is equally a dominant presence of christian churches in Bamunkumbit village with the most common ones being: Catholic, Presbyterian, Baptist, Full Gospel etc. In the year 2004, there was a great persecution of Christians who belonged to the Apostolic Church denomination. These Christians were accused by the traditionalists for interfering in their tradition and were severely tortured and compelled to denounce their faith. Those who didn't denounce their faith were eventually driven out of the village. The Apostolic Church house was torn down in the process. Economic Activities Bamunkumbit is a rural community with the greatest proportion of the population engaged in farming. The farming sector employs more that 70% of the total population. The farming population is mostly made up of the middle-aged and the aged. Farming in this village mostly for household consumption, with very little left for commercialization. Most of the youths often move out of the village into the cities for greener pastures. They mainly get involved in business or education. Agricultural Land Use As an agricultural community, Bamunkumbit has a rich diversity of crops. Some of the crops cultivated in Bamunkumbit include: maize, groundnuts, beans, soya, cassava, yams, rice, cocoa-yams, etc. A great proportion of the population is also involved in grazing.http://thesuncameroon.cm/index.php/2019/11/20/bamunkumbit- afforestation-project-counter-influence-climate-change Cattle in this village are mostly reared by the Mbororo community. https://www.weatheravenue.com/en/africa/cm/nord-ouest/bamunkumbit- pictures.html References  See also  * Balikumbat Populated places in Northwest Region (Cameroon) ","title":"Bamunkumbit"},{"id":"47150262","text":"Michael Patrick \\"Mick\\" Blake (13 September 1874 ‚Äì 2 January 1931) was an Australian rules footballer who played with St Kilda in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Biography Early life and family Blake was born in St Kilda, Victoria on 13 September 1874, one of 11 children to Irish emigrants John Blake and Ellen Coen, who came from Galway. He had seven brothers, many of whom were also gifted sportsmen, two of them played in the VFL. A younger brother, George Blake, was a two-time olympic long distance runner who also appeared in the VFL, for St Kilda and Carlton. James Blake and Tom Blake, both elder brothers, played football for the same two clubs. James, who captained St Kilda, retired by the time the VFL was formed, but Tom continued his career in the VFL. Another brother, Harry Blake, was a prominent cross country runner. He had three children with wife Holly: Allyn, Thomas and Winifred. Football Recruited from Collegians, Blake started his career with Carlton in the VFA, where he played until transferring to St Kilda in the 1895 season. At Carlton he had played under the captaincy of his brother Tom and was described by the Sporting Globe as having been one of the formidable ruckmen in the team. He missed St Kilda's inaugural league game in the 1897 VFL season but was in the side from round two and played 13 games that year, followed by 14 in 1898. Both were winless seasons and he was also in the losing team for his three appearances in 1899, which agonisingly included a two-point loss. He didn't continue in 1900 and finished his VFL career with 30 games and no wins, joint fourth most in the league's history, all ahead of him played for University. Other sports Blake, a member of the Collegian Harriers, was also an amateur athlete like some of his brothers. He first competed in athletics at the Victorian 10-mile cross-country championships in 1891. In addition to athletics and football, Blake was a good enough diver to win the Victorian title, in a field which included Cecil Healy.

Career  The date and place of Buƒçiƒá's birth and death are unknown. Buƒçiƒá was a vicar in Belica and in Meƒëimurje. Until 1565 he was a vicar in Stenjevac but had to move to estate of Juraj IV Zrinski in Nedeli≈°ƒáe because of the conflict with Franjo Tahi. In 1574 Juraj Dra≈°koviƒá, the bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Zagreb, strictly followed recommendations of the Council of Trent and expelled Buƒçiƒá from Catholic church under accusations that his book was heretic propaganda of Protestantism. Dra≈°koviƒá also ordered burning of Buƒçiƒás books and publishing of new books to dispute writings of Buƒçiƒá. It is possible that Postilla authored by Antun Vramec is published in 1586 in Vara≈ædin to follow the orders of Dra≈°koviƒá. Buƒçiƒá significantly contributed to spreading of Protentantism in the Habsburg Kingdom of Croatia. Because Buƒçiƒá enjoyed protection of the lord of Meƒëimurje, Juraj IV Zrinski, thanks to whom (and later to his sons) this area was the only significant stronghold of Protestantism in Croatia for 50 years.  Bibliography  Buƒçiƒá was the forerunner of the Vara≈ædin literary circle and one of the first writers on Kajkavian dialect. Two books he wrote were banned and burned during period of the counter reformation movement so there is no evidence about the language or script he used in them. Still, it is assumed that he wrote his works on Kajkavian dialect and also on Latin language. According to some sources Buƒçiƒá published three of his works in Nedeli≈°ƒáe.

She studied art in her father's studio and with Edward William Godwin who was an architect-designer. On 4 January 1876 she became the second wife of Edward Godwin. Following the death of Godwin, Beatrice married James McNeill Whistler on 11 August 1888. Family Ethel Philip reading a newspaper by Beatrix Whistler Edward Godwin and Beatrice had a son together, also called Edward (1876-1951), who became known as a sculptor. He created the bronze angels that were placed on the Whistlers' tomb in Chiswick Old Cemetery. Her sister Ethel Whibley had been the secretary to Whistler before her marriage to the writer Charles Whibley. After the death of Beatrice in 1896, her younger sister Rosalind Birnie Philip acted as secretary to Whistler and was appointed Whistler's executrix in his will. In Whistler's correspondence Beatrice was referred to as 'Trixie' or 'Chinkie' and also ‚ÄòLuck‚Äô and ‚ÄòWam‚Äô; his sister-in- law and secretary (1890‚Äì94) Ethel Whibley was 'Bunnie'; his brother-in-law Charles Whibley was 'Wobbles'; and Rosalind was referred to as (the 'Major'); with Whistler signing family correspondence as the 'General' when he did not sign with his butterfly signature.Whistler correspondence, whistler.arts.gla.ac.uk; accessed 20 March 2016. Marriage to James McNeill Whistler Harmony in Red: Lamplight used Beatrice as the model Maud Franklin had been Whistler‚Äôs main model since the 1870s and became Whistler‚Äôs mistress. She called herself \\"Mrs Whistler\\", with Whistler usually referring to her in company as \\"Madame\\". Whistler showed no intention of marrying Maud. Through his friendship with Edward Godwin, Whistler became close to Beatrice (or \\"Trixie\\" as he called her). Whistler painted her in the full-length portrait titled Harmony in Red: Lamplight (GLAHA 46315). In 1885 Beatrice separated from her husband as a result of his compulsive philandering. Godwin died in 1886. By the summer of 1888 Whistler and Beatrice appeared in public as a couple. At a dinner Louise Jopling and Henry Labouch√®re insisted that they should be married before the end of the week. The wedding was arranged; as a member of Parliament, Henry Labouch√®re arranged for the Chaplain to the House of Commons to marry the couple. No publicity was given to the ceremony to avoid the possibility of a furious Maud Franklin interrupting the marriage ceremony. The marriage took place on 11 August 1888, with the ceremony attended by a reporter from the Pall Mall Gazette, so that the event received publicity after the event. The couple left soon after for Paris, to avoid any risk of a scene with Maud. After their marriage they lived in Tower House, 33 Tite Street, then in 1889, Whistler and Beatrice moved to 21 Cheyne Walk, in Chelsea, London. After an indifferent reception to his solo show in the Goupil Gallery, London, featuring mostly his nocturnes, Whistler abruptly decided he had had enough of London. He and Beatrice moved to Paris in 1892 and resided at n¬∞ 110 Rue du Bac, Paris, with his studio at the top of 86 Rue Notre Dame des Champs in Montparnasse. He was at the top of his career when it was discovered that Beatrice had cancer. They returned to London in February 1896, taking rooms at the Savoy Hotel while they sought medical treatment. Whistler‚Äôs portraits of her, The Siesta (C.159) and By the Balcony (C.160), were drawn as she lay dying. She died at St. Jude's Cottage in Hampstead Heath on 10 May 1896 and was buried on her birthday, 12 May, in Chiswick Old Cemetery in the London Borough of Hounslow. Following his death Whistler was buried in the same tomb as his wife. Paintings and drawings Beatrice signed her work with a monogram or trefoil 'BP', then 'BG'. She also exhibited as 'Rix Birnie' to avoid being stigmatised as a female artist. A limited number of her works remain: oil studies The Novel and The Muslin Gown are in private collections; Ethel Philip Reading a Newspaper is in the Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery; and Peach Blossom is in the National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C. Her jewellery designs are in the National Gallery of Art and the Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery. Images of her that were painted by Whistler include: ; Paintings: Harmony in Red: Lamplight (GLAHA 46315), a full-length portrait. ; Drawings: The Siesta (C.159) and By the Balcony (C.160). Louise Jopling (1843‚Äì1933), a poet and portrait painter, also painted a portrait of Beatrice.

He currently serves as professor of Old Testament, or Hebrew Bible, in the Faculty of Theology at the University of G√∂ttingen, in Germany. In his various authorial, editorial, advisory, and administrative capacities, Kratz has had a sizeable impact on research into the Hebrew Bible and ancient Judaism.  Life  After studies in theology and classics at the universities in Frankfurt, Heidelberg, and Z√ºrich (1977‚Äì82), Kratz became scientific assistant to Old Testament professor Odil Hannes Steck in Z√ºrich (1982‚Äì86). Following a requisite internship (Vikariat) in the Evangelical-Reformed Church of the Canton of Z√ºrich, he was then ordained as Verbi Divini Minister, in 1987. That same year, Kratz earned his doctor of theology with a dissertation on the Aramaic portions of the book of Daniel, and three years later, in 1990, he secured habilitation for his work Kyros im Deuterojesajabuch. While serving as Privatdozent in Z√ºrich, from 1991‚Äì95, he obtained fellowships from the Deutsches Evangelisches Institut f√ºr Altertumswissenschaft des Heiligen Landes and the Heisenberg-Programm. Since 1995, Kratz has held a chair in Old Testament Studies at the University of G√∂ttingen.  Academic Honors  In 1999, Kratz became a member of the G√∂ttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities. During the 2002‚Äì03 academic year, he was fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Berlin. Kratz also spent 2006‚Äì07 as Fowler Hamilton Visiting Research Fellow at Christ Church College, University of Oxford, and 2014‚Äì15 as Overseas Visiting Scholar at St. John's College, University of Cambridge. In 2015, he was appointed honorary member of the British Society for the Old Testament. He has declined professorships at the University of Kiel (1995), University of Heidelberg (2003), Humboldt University of Berlin (2008), and University of Oxford, as Oriel and Laing Professor of the Interpretation of Holy Scripture (2014).  Areas of Expertise  Kratz's work concentrates on the literary and redaction history of the Old Testament. With such research, he has revitalized an historical account of the Old Testament literature that traces back to Julius Wellhausen‚ÄîWellhausen himself having furthered theses already advanced by such figures as Wilhelm Vatke, Eduard Reuss, Karl Heinrich Graf, and Abraham Kuenen. Kratz has also devoted considerable attention to ancient Near Eastern and Old Testament prophecy. Recently, however, he has focused more and more on the history of Judaism in the Persian and Hellenistic periods, especially in its manifestation at the communities of Elephantine and Qumran.  Professional Actitivites  A member of the G√∂ttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities, Kratz currently serves as chairman of the board for the Academy's Septuaginta Unternehmen and director of its longterm lexicon project Hebr√§isches und aram√§isches Lexikon √ºber die Texte vom Toten Meer. He also directs the Division for Qumran Research at the Institute for Special Research, located at G√∂ttingen's Faculty of Theology, and the Centrum Orbis Orientalis (CORO), an interdisciplinary center supported by the University as well as the Academy. In addition, he acted as vice- speaker for the German Research Foundation Research Training Group (Graduiertenkolleg) 896 \\"Concepts of the Divine ‚Äì Concepts of the World\\" and co-organizer for the joint project \\"The Interpretation of the Book of Genesis in the Dead Sea Scrolls,\\" funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft in cooperation with the Deborah Dimant of the University of Haifa. Kratz sits on a number of editorial boards, for series and journals alike, and on the steering committee for the Northern European research network Old Testament Studies: Epistemologies and Methods (OTSEM). For many of these activities, Kratz works closely with his G√∂ttingen Old Testament colleague, Hermann Spieckermann.  Select Publications  * Translatio imperii.

After the death of her sister Beatrice in 1896 Rosalind acted as secretary to Whistler and was appointed Whistler's sole beneficiary and the executrix in his will.Biography of Rosalind Birnie Philip, (1873‚Äì1958) University of Glasgow, Special Collections Life Rosalind Birnie Philip was born at Chelsea, London on 14 November 1873. She was the youngest of ten children of the sculptor John Birnie PhilipBiography of John Birnie Philip, (1824‚Äì1875) and Frances Black. Rosalind‚Äôs sister Beatrice married James McNeill Whistler in 1888, following the death of her first husband Edward William Godwin. Her sister Ethel Whibley had been the secretary to Whistler from 1890 to 1894 before her marriage to the writer Charles Whibley. In Whistler's correspondence Beatrice Whistler was referred to a 'Trixie' or 'Chinkie', also ‚ÄòLuck‚Äô and ‚ÄòWam‚Äô; her sister Ethel Whibley was 'Bunnie'; her brother-in-law Charles Whibley was 'Wobbles'; and Rosalind was referred to as the 'Major'; with Whistler signing family correspondence as the 'General' when he did not sign with his butterfly signature.Whistler correspondence, on-line edition, University of Glasgow In 1896, when Rosalind was 22 years of age, Beatrice died of cancer. Whistler made her his ward and in his will she was appointed his executrix. She acted as his secretary and also modelled for Whistler. From 1902 she managed Whistler‚Äôs household in Chelsea which included Rosalind‚Äôs mother. In 1900 Whistler‚Äôs publisher, William Heinemann, proposed to Whistler that he authorise a biography and Heinemann suggested William Ernest Henley, then Charles Whibley, neither of whom were acceptable to Whistler; although the Pennells, who were friends and admirers of Whistler, were accepted by Whistler as suitable biographers. Heinemann asked Joseph Pennell and Elizabeth Robins Pennell to write his biography. The biography was published as The Life of James McNeill Whistler (Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott Co.; London: W. Heinemann, 1908), although Rosalind, as executor of Whistler‚Äôs estate, attempted to prevent its publication because she disapproved of the manuscript. Rosalind saw her role as being the guardian of Whistler's reputation. Her views about the Pennells' biography recalls Whistler's objection to biographers. Whistler had stated that he was \\"determined that no mendacious scamp shall tell the foolish truths about me.\\" Bequest of Whistler‚Äôs collection Following Whistler‚Äôs death in 1903 Rosalind inherited his estate. She continued to collect his letters and purchased prints to add to the collection of the works of Whistler. In 1938 she made the first gift to the Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery of the University of Glasgow, of major paintings of Whistler as well as prints, pastels and drawings. In 1955 she gifted the University a collection of Whistler‚Äôs correspondence and books. Following Rosalind‚Äôs death in 1958 the balance of her collection of Whistler‚Äôs paintings, works on paper and manuscripts and books went to the University.

Plot Jia, an anthropologist comes to the forests to study tribals where she meets Kabir Sagar, a forest officer. Fiercely protective of the forest, Kabir initially resents Jia's visit, taking her to be another pretentious expert on an excursion. Jia returns the cold vibes, but takes a liking to his assistant Bichhua, a local tribal, who takes her to where he lives in the interior. There, she comes to know the designs of a timber mafia out to axe trees in the forest and a local landlord Mangeram in cahoots with a multinational company out to acquire the forest land. Jia and Kabir too come close. Kabir presents her an ornate comb, a tribal man's way of professing his love. But she wards off any ideas of romantic involvement. Meanwhile, men in the village are coaxed into cutting trees, but women plan to defy them, aided by Jia and Bichhua.

The forest is saved and Bichhua's wedding festivities are on when Jia, who has been offered a scholarship to study abroad, in the meanwhile, makes a surprise appearance wearing the comb in her hair.

These foods are designed to be \\"convenient, eaten on the go, hyperpalatable and appealing to consumers, and, most importantly, the most profitable segment of Big Food companies‚Äô portfolios because of these foods‚Äô low-cost ingredients\\".  Definition  The concept of ultra-processed food was initially developed and the term coined by the Brazilian nutrition researcher Carlos Monteiro, with his team at the Center for Epidemiological Research in Nutrition and Health (NUPENS) at the University of S√£o Paulo, Brazil. Its rationale is that with nutrition and health now, 'the issue is not food, nor nutrients, so much as processing', and 'from the point of view of human health, at present, the most salient division of food and drinks is in terms of their type, degree, and purpose of processing'. Specifications and definitions of ultra-processed foods are available in reports published by United Nations agencies, most recently in 2019, in the literature, in the Open Food Facts database, and in the media. They include: * Carbonated soft drinks * Sweet, fatty or salty packaged snacks * Candies (confectionery) * Mass-produced packaged breads and buns * Cookies (biscuits) * Pastries * Cakes and cake mixes * Margarine and other spreads * Sweetened breakfast cereals * Sweetened fruit yoghurt and energy drinks * Powdered and packaged instant soups, noodles, and desserts * Pre-prepared meat, cheese, pasta and pizza dishes * Poultry and fish nuggets and sticks * Sausages, burgers, hot dogs, and other reconstituted meat products. Ultra- processed food is the fourth category in the NOVA food classification system based on the nature, extent and purpose of industrial food processing. The other three categories are: * Unprocessed or minimally processed food * Processed industrial ingredients * Processed foods Processing as such is essential, and virtually all food is processed in some way. The term ultra- processing refers to the processing of industrial ingredients derived from foods, for example by extruding, moulding, re-shaping, hydrogenation, and hydrolysis. Ultra-processed foods generally also include additives such as preservatives, sweeteners, sensory enhancers, colourants, flavours, and processing aids, but little or no whole food. They may be fortified with micronutrients. The aim is to create durable, convenient and palatable ready- to-eat or ready-to-heat food products suitable to be consumed as snacks or to replace freshly-prepared food-based dishes and meals.  Economics  Ultra- processed foods are often an important part of food corporation portfolios because they rely on cheap ingredients. They are designed for broad consumer appeal. They are often discretionary foods, snacked rather than consumed as part of meals. Among other reasons, the inexpensive cost of their ingredients and their aggressive marketing has resulted in their rapid growth, particularly in middle income countries.  Impacts  Epidemiological studies published since 2012 carried out in countries including Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, the USA, Canada, the UK, France, Spain, Australia, and Taiwan consistently show that increasing or high consumption of ultra- processed food is associated with reduction of diet quality or increased incidence variously of obesity or chronic non-communicable conditions and diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, some cancers, and with earlier mortality. A randomised controlled trial carried out by researchers from the US National Institutes of Health published in 2019 has found that consumption of ultra-processed foods causes increased energy intake and increased fat and total body weight Four Latin American countries ‚Äî Brazil, Uruguay, Peru, and Ecuador ‚Äî have so far published national official dietary guidelines that recommend avoiding ultra-processed foods. Ultra-processed foods are identified as harmful to health in a 2019 official government report from France and as published in 2020 by the World Bank. Ultra-processed foods have higher environmental impacts than fresh foods.  Appraisals  The utility of the NOVA classification and its concept of ultra-processing has been subject to criticism. Most published criticisms of NOVA has come from authors associated in some way with the manufacturers of ultra-processed food, their representative organisations, or organisations they support. A 2018 BMJ editorial comments: > 'Ultra-processed foods is a broad (and potentially rapidly changing) food > category that includes multiple foods prepared by a variety of methods and > containing a myriad of nutrients and food additives' A 2019 report published by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization concludes in part: 'More epidemiological research is especially needed on the impact of ultra-processed food intake on the health and well-being of infants, children and adolescents including its effects on both diet-related chronic NCDs and also on undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies. More cohort studies on obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, various types of cancer and other diseases will enable meta-analyses of their association with ultra-processed food intake and estimation of disease-specific pooled relative risks.' Independent assessments generally conclude that further research should guide public policies and actions, and not delay them. Such actions should include statutory ‚Äî including fiscal ‚Äî measures designed to make unprocessed and minimally processed food more available and affordable, to encourage consumption of freshly-prepared meals, to eliminate all subsidies and price support schemes that make ultra-processed food artificially cheap, and to regulate and restrict its manufacture and marketing.  Media coverage  A French longitudinal study from the Nutri Net Sant√© group published in 2018 showing a correlation between ultra-processed food and cancer risk prompted some media outlets to run alarmist headlines claiming that eating such food may raise cancer risk, or does raise risk ‚Äî these headlines were based on a common misunderstanding between correlation and causation. Media coverage of ultra-processed food, and ultra-processing and the NOVA food classification generally has been very extensive since publication beginning in 2018 of a series of French studies undertaken by the Nutri Net Sant√© group, and publication in 2019 of the US National Institutes of Health randomised controlled trial of ultra-processed food and increases in body weight and fat. This includes briefings from scientific centres and expert organisations, reports in many countries on television and radio, newspapers and magazines, videos, podcasts, blogs, and commentary on the internet, some of which has been summarised and quoted. As reported on US National Public Radio and in the New York Times, senior US researchers were impressed by the National Institutes of Health study. Dariush Mozaffarian, Dean of Tufts University's Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, said: ‚ÄòThese are landmark findings, that processing of foods makes a huge difference in how much a person eats‚Äô. Barry Popkin, of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who like Dariush Mozaffarian was not involved in the NIH study, said: ‚ÄòThe difference in weight gain for one group and weight loss for the other during these two periods is phenomenal. This is a very important study and a major challenge to the global food industry and the food science profession'.

This lake was built by Maharana Udai Singh in 1565. Udai Sagar Lake is around 4 km in length, 2.5 km in width and 9 meters deep at the maximum. It is fed by the Ahar River.  History  In 1559, Maharana Udai Singh constructed a dam on Berach River to ensure adequate supply of water in his kingdom. Udai Sagar Lake was developed as an outcome of this dam. This dam at Udaisagar Lake drains about 479 km2, and covers an area of 10.5 km2.  Threats to the lake  According to a study made on the environmental pollution of Udaisagar, Udai sagar lake's water revealed high phosphate contents, due to discharge of pollutants from surrounding phosphorite mines, chemical factories, distillery, sewage and domestic waste from settlements and hotels. All these pollutants, reaching this lake through the River Ahar, make the water unhygienic for human consumption and unfavorable for survival of aquatic life.  Lake restoration works  The task of restoration and transformation of the Lake Udai Sagar and Goverdhan Sagar is taken up by National Lake Conservation Program (NLCP). Udaipur is the first city in the state where all 4 lakes will be developed under the NLCP.

It is a rhizomatous perennial, from the mountains of Turkestan, between Tajikistan and Afghanistan. It has tall slender stems, long leaves and greenish yellow flowers covered, with brown violet, or brown purple veining over the top. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions. Description It is very similar in form toIris darwasica. It has a small, short rhizome, which is less than 2 cm long. It is covered (on the top) with the fibrous remains of last seasons leaves. It has secondary roots, short stolons. It has erect, linear, leaves that are long and 0.3‚Äì0.6 cm wide. They disappear after the blooming period, and begin to re-grow the next season in January. It has an erect stem, that can grow up to between tall. The stem has acuminate (pointed), membranous, spathes or bracts, (leaves of the flower bud), which are long, with pale margins. The upper third of the spathe is flushed purple. The stems hold between 2 and 3 terminal (top of stem) flowers, blooming in spring, between April and May. The long and thin, flowers are in diameter. They are greenish yellow, with brown violet, or brown purple veining over the top. It has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The elliptic to oblanceolate falls are long, and 1.3 cm wide, with a long blue beard, in the centre of the fall. The elliptic to oblanceolate standards are long, they also have a thin beard. It has short pedicels and a long perianth tube. It has pale blue style branches, that are long, purple brown lobes, anthers that are 1.4‚Äì1.7 cm long, filaments that are 1‚Äì1.2 cm long and yellow pollen. After the iris has flowered, it produces a seed capsule and seed, which have not been described. Biochemistry As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has a chromosome count: 2n=22.  Taxonomy It is pronounced as (Iris) EYE-ris (lineata) lin-ee-AY-tuh. It is commonly known as 'Lined Iris' (in Russia). The Latin specific epithet lineata means with lines (or stripes). It refers to the veins on the narrow standards and falls. It was first published and described by Regel in 'Gartenflora' Vol.36 Issue 201, table 1244 in 1887. Then by Foster in Curtis's Botanical Magazine Vol.114 in 1888. It was also published (by Foster) in The Gardeners' Chronicle Series 3 Vol.4 page 36 in 1888. Was once thought a synonym of Iris darwasica, In 1935, Iris karategina was published and described by B.Fedtsch., in 'Flora URSS' (Flora Unionis Rerumpublicarum Sovieticarum Socialisticarum) Vol 4 page542. It was later classified as a synonym of Iris lineata. In 1968, it was published in 'Yearbook of the British Iris Society' with a colour illustration. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 2 October 2014. Iris lineata is an accepted name by the RHS. Distribution and habitat Iris lineata is native to temperate areas of central Asia. a native to Central Asia (north of Afghanistan). Central Asia, north-eastern Afghanistan Range It was found in the former country of Turkestan. The current range is between Tajikistan, (including the Karateginskii Range, within the Gissar Mountain Range), and in Afghanistan, within the upper Farkhar Valley of Farkhar District, in the Takhar Province. Habitat It grows on the dry, rocky open slopes of granite mountains. They can be found at an altitude of above sea level. Conservation This is a protected iris, listed on the Red Data Book of Tajikistan. Cultivation It prefers to grow in well-drained soils in full sun. It can be grown in alpine houses.

They performed under the \\"Batten Twins\\" name in Central States Wrestling, Continental Wrestling Association, International Championship Wrestling, Jim Crockett Promotions, Southern Championship Wrestling, Texas All-Star Wrestling, World Championship Wrestling, and the World Wrestling Council, and the name U.S. Express in World Class Championship Wrestling. The team also appeared in various independent promotions during the 1990s including, most notably, Atlantic Coast Championship Wrestling, IWA Mid- South, Smoky Mountain Wrestling and Southern States Wrestling. A popular tag team in the Southern United States during the 1980s, the Battens faced off against some of the top tag teams of the era. They began their wrestling career working for the Poffo family in 1983. As identical twins, the brothers were a rarity in pro wrestling at the time of their debut. Their tenure in the NWA's Central States territory saw them engaged in a long feud with Sheik Abdullah. They held the NWA Central States Tag Team Championship a record four times, defeating The Midnight Express, the Midnight Rockers, Sheik Abdullah and Akio Sato, and Bobby Jaggers (in a singles match) for the title. The Battens were also major stars in Puerto Rico during the late-1980s where they won WWC Tag Team Championship four times and the WWC Caribbean Tag Team Championship twice. Their unexpected \\"heel turn\\" made them one of the most hated wrestlers in the country. After returning to the U.S., the Battens continued wrestling on the Southern independent circuit until the early-2000s. In April 2005, The Batten Twins ended their 23-year career with a retirement tour of their home state. Early life Bradley Jay \\"Brad\\" Batten and Bartley Alan \\"Bart\\" Batten were born to Marjorie (n√©e Hayes) and Jack Batten in New Martinsville, West Virginia on September 8, 1958. They were involved in youth sports at an early age. In 1969, the brothers were featured in The Charleston Daily Mail about identical twins who participate in little league baseball. Both brothers played football from junior high to college with Bart attending West Virginia State University and Brad going to Glenville State College. As both schools had a longtime football rivalry, the brothers often played against each other but with Bart as a wide receiver and Brad a running back they were never on the field at the same time. In addition to teaching school, Bart Batten went on to play two years of semi-professional football for the West Virginia Rockets. Professional wrestling career International Championship Wrestling (1983‚Äì1984) Both brothers were wrestling fans and decided to try out for a career in pro wrestling after attending several International Championship Wrestling shows in the early 1980s. The two spent about a year working out until they each weighed . They also experimented with steroids during this time. Then living in St. Albans, West Virginia, Bart approached Lanny Poffo at an ICW show in Beckley. The wrestler introduced Brad to his brother Randy Savage and invited the brothers to the promotion's next show in Marmet to meet with their father Angelo Poffo. Lanny later admitted to Brad that he was skeptical about him having a twin brother but when the twins entered the dressing room the Poffo family \\"saw dollar signs\\" as identical twins were very rare in the wrestling business at the time. The Battens were initially trained by Lanny Poffo in Sutton, West Virginia. Bart recalled that Poffo had tried to \\"shoot on him\\" during their first day of training by putting him in a front facelock. He had wrestled three years in high school, however, and was able to reverse the facelock and make Poffo submit to a guillotine hold. Their training progressed quickly after this incident, with both Angelo Poffo and Randy Savage taking part, and they were put into their first match after only a few sessions. The brothers became close friends with both Lanny and Randy. Brad especially became a key figure behind the scenes by helping produce ICW's television show as well as driving the ring truck and setting up the ring. They made their pro debut on May 12, 1983, against Tony Falk and Doug Vines in Prestonsburg, Kentucky. Brad was injured shortly after their debut when he blew out his left knee performing a jumping high five and toe kick with his brother. Ironically, this would become a signature maneuver during their career. He would be out of action for nearly a year and a half. While his brother was recovering from his injury, Bart was paired with Johnny Wilhoit and subsequently defeated Tojo Yamamoto and Gypsy Joe for the ICW United States Tag Team Championship. They remained champions until the promotion's close the following year. Continental Wrestling Association (1984‚Äì1985)  After ICW's close, Brad Batten began working for rival promoter Jerry Jarrett's Continental Wrestling Association promotion in Memphis, Tennessee. Wrestling under the name \\"Mark Batten\\", he made his first appearance at the Mid-South Coliseum teaming with Porkchop Cash against AWA Southern Tag Team Champions Tommy Rich and Eddie Gilbert on April 30, 1984. Following their loss, Batten formed a new tag team with Johnny Wilhoit called \\"The New Generation\\". A music video filmed on Jarrett's estate near Nashville was aired on Memphis Championship Wrestling to introduce the team; it became a viral video after it was shown by Jon Stewart on The Daily Show nearly thirty years later. The team was intended to capitalize on the popularity of The Fabulous Ones and The Rock 'n' Roll Express but they failed to catch on with fans. The New Generation's last match was against The Dirty White Boys (Tony Anthony and Len Denton) at the Mid-South Coliseum on October 8, 1984, which they lost. Brad was eventually joined by his brother and had their first match together against former trainers Lanny Poffo and Randy Savage. At the end of year, the team had several matches against The Nightmares (Danny Davis and Ken Wayne). The brothers also wrestled Plowboy Frazier in three separate handicap matches at the Mid-South Coliseum between December 31, 1984 and January 28, 1985. They lost to Frazier and Adrian Street in a tag team match that same month. On February 11, the Battens got their revenge on Frazier when they finally beat him in a handicap match; due to the pre-match stipulations, the twins would have lost their hair had they lost the match. In their first three months together, the Battens faced Eddie Gilbert & \\"Iron\\" Mike Sharpe, The Terminators (Crow and Riggs), and The Wild Hoggs (J.R. and King Harley Hogg) at WMC Studio. In April 1985, Brad Batten wrestled single matches against Mike Sharpe, Mr. Wrestling and AWA Southern Heavyweight Champion Randy Savage. The Batten Twins also challenged The PYT Express (Koko Ware and Norvell Austin) for the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship but they were unsuccessful in winning the title. That summer, the Battens battled Hot Property (Billy Travis and Ron Sexton) and The Kiwi Sheepherders (Jonathan Boyd and Rip Morgan) before leaving the area. NWA Central States (1985‚Äì1986) The Batten Twins moved on to the NWA's Central States territory where they had a long-running feud with Sheik Abdullah The Great and his various tag team partners, most often Akio Sato and Tarzan Goto, but also including American Starship Coyote and Mr. Pogo. Within a few weeks of their arrival, they also received a title shot against NWA Central States Tag Team Champions \\"Bulldog\\" Bob Brown and Marty Jannetty. It was during this match that the champions split up when Brown stopped cooperating with his partner. The championship remained vacant until The Batten Twins defeated The Midnight Express (Dennis Condrey and Bobby Eaton) in a tournament final on November 21, 1985. Their first title reign lasted three months before the championship was held-up following a title defense in Kansas City, Kansas against Sheik Abdullah and Akio Sato on February 20, 1986. The title was returned to The Batten Twins following a rematch one week later. On March 6, Bart Batten defeated Sheik Abdullah in a Texas Death match. Batten took the first fall when he made his opponent submit to an abdominal stretch while Abdullah took the next two wins by pinfall. The bout ended when Abdullah failed to get up after a 10-count. Batten had previously lost to Abdullah in an Iranian Death match two months earlier. On April 19, the team entered the inaugural Jim Crockett, Sr. Memorial Cup Tag Team Tournament at the Louisiana Superdome but were eliminated in the first round by Nelson Royal and Sam Houston. In May 1986, The Batten Twins were defeated by the young duo of Marty Jannetty and Shawn Michaels, The Midnight Rockers, for the NWA Central States Tag Team titles. They quickly regained the belts from The Midnight Rockers the following week, causing Michaels to leave the territory, but dropped them to Hacksaw Higgins and J.R. Hogg on May 29. Though their feud was short-lived, the Battens considered The Midnight Rockers one of their favorite opponents of all time. World Class Championship Wrestling (1986) Bart and Brad Batten were brought into World Class Championship Wrestling during the summer of 1986. The team was renamed the U.S. Express and Bart given the name \\"Mark Batten\\". One day after losing the NWA Central States belts, they made their WCCW television debut against Killer Brooks and Matt Borne in Dallas, Texas on May 30, 1986. On June 9, The Batten Twins and Steve Simpson beat Matt Borne, Killer Brooks and The Assassin in a six-man tag team match. During the next two months, The Battens scored victories over Jerry Allen and The Grapplers (Grappler #1 and Grappler #2). On July 11, they were beaten by Matt Borne and The Dingo Warrior. A week later in Fort Worth, both brothers wrestled in singles matches; Bart Batten was pinned by WCCW Television Champion \\"Mad Dog\\" Buzz Sawyer, however, Brad Batten beat The Dingo Warrior via disqualification. After the Batten-Sawyer bout, Sawyer put Bart Batten in a gorilla press slam and tossed him over the top rope. He fell 20 feet onto the concrete floor. The WCCW TV Champion then attacked Brad Batten and Perry Jackson, who were coming to aid Bart, which instigated a 4-man brawl between Sawyer and Borne versus Steve Simpson and Kevin Von Erich. Brad Batten later talked with Fritz von Erich about booking the brothers as \\"heels\\" and suggested a \\"family vs. family\\" storyline pitting the Batten and Von Erich brothers against each other but the promoter turned down the idea. At Labor Day Star Wars '86, The Batten Twins lost to Mark Lewin and Kevin Sullivan in the opening rounds of championship tournament for the WCWA World Tag Team Championship. The next night at Fort Hood's Prichard Stadium, The Batten Twins defeated Killer Brooks and Perry Jackson. Moments after Bart pinned Jackson, their opponents began fighting with each other with Brooks vowing never to partner with Jackson again. They lost to Rick Rude and Jos LeDuc a week later in Fort Worth. At the 3rd Cotton Bowl Extravaganza, The Batten Twins were beaten by Chris and Mark Youngblood. Texas All-Star Wrestling (1986) The Battens made a brief appearance in Texas All-Star Wrestling before they departed the territory. On November 1, Brad Batten wrestled Master Gee on the debut episode of Texas Championship Wrestling. The Batten Twins faced The Grapplers the following week. Brad Batten made a third and final appearance for TASW on the November 15th 1986 episode of Texas Championship Wrestling against Black Bart. NWA Central States (1986‚Äì1987) By December 1986, the Batten Twins were back in NWA Central States and had scored victories over The Thunderfoots (Thunderfoot #1 and Thunderfoot #2) and Porkchop Cash & Colt Steele. On January 30, 1987, Brad and Bart Batten lost a chance to regain the NWA Central States Tag Team Championship from The MOD Squad (Spike and Basher) at the St. Louis Arena. The match was later aired on the Jim Crockett Promotions television special \\"NWA Super Towns on the Superstation\\". The winning team won an invitation to the second annual Jim Crockett, Sr. Memorial Cup Tag Team Tournament. On February 27, Brad Batten teamed with Rick McCord to beat The MOD Squad for the belts. They soon became involved in a feud with Porkchop Cash and Ken Timbs. The title was declared held-up on April 3 after a controversial title defense against Cash and Timbs when the former used a foreign object to win the match; a rematch was held a week later for the belts, which Batten and McCord lost. Three months later, Brad Batten and Bobby Jaggers were awarded the vacant titles by the NWA after Karl Kovac was fired and The Warlord left to work in Japan. Batten and Jaggers split up two months later. The title was decided in a singles match between them on August 6, which Batten won. This allowed The Batten Twins to regain the title as Brad chose Bart Batten as his partner. They were joined by Downtown Bruno as their manager. Brad and Bart Batten faced The Kansas Outlaws (Bobby Jaggers and Psycho Sam) in Carroll, Iowa and Sheldon, Missouri later that month. Their fourth and final title reign came to an end when the team was defeated by Rick McCord and Porkchop Cash in Versailles, Missouri on November 9, 1987. World Organization of Wrestling (1987‚Äì1988) The Battens moved on to World Organization of Wrestling in Pensacola, Florida where they feuded with Badd Company (Paul Diamond and Pat Tanaka) and The Fabulous Fargos (Ken Timbs and Pat Rose). They teamed with Mr. Olympia in several six-man tag team matches against The Fargos and Bob Holly. One of the team's matches saw their opponents break up when Big Bubba turned on his partner Samoan Kokina. World Wrestling Council (1988‚Äì1989) After a brief stint in Southern Championship Wrestling, The Batten Twins went to Puerto Rico to compete in the World Wrestling Council where they found considerable success. Their stay in the country was not without some controversy, however. The Battens were among the six American wrestlers who decided to remain after the murder of Bruiser Brody on July 17, 1988. Wrestling Observer editor Dave Meltzer speculated that the team may have had \\"legit heat\\" as they were the only wrestlers to leave a U.S. promotion to compete in Puerto Rico and \\"may have to stay there until this all blows over\\". Bart Batten later defended their decision as they had families to support and could not afford to turn down bookings. The Battens had been fans of Brody prior to entering wrestling, later becoming friends with him while in NWA Central States and WCCW, and Brad felt that their old friend \\"wouldn't have held it against us\\". On August 6, they defeated The Ninja Express (Kendo Nagasaki and Mr. Pogo) in San Juan, Puerto Rico for the WWC Tag Team Championship. A month later at WWC Aniversario 1988, the Battens retained the titles against The Sheepherders (Butch Miller and Luke Williams). The Sheepherders had initially been declared the winners after Miller had interfered in the match by hitting Brad in the head with a flagpole. A second official came out to inform the referee what had occurred and the Battens were awarded the match via disqualification. The Batten Twins later provided commentary with Ecuadorian promoter Hugo Savinovich when the match was released on DVD. They consider this bout one of the greatest matches of their career. They lost the title to Chicky and Ron Starr in Aguadilla on October 16, but they won the titles back in Caguas on November 12, 1988. The team lost the title two months later to Dan Kroffat and Tama the Islander. The Batten Twins regained the belts for a third time in Bayam√≥n on March 4, 1989 only to drop the belts to Jason the Terrible and Steve Strong a week later. That same month, The Batten Twins were featured as part of a cover story for Wrestling Life. That spring the Battens were on the look out for more tag team gold. They beat The Ninja Express for the WWC Caribbean Tag Team Championship in Dorado on April 2, their opponents having won them the previous night in San Juan. Shortly after winning the belts, the Battens began feuding with The Puerto Rican Express (Hurricane Castillo, Jr. and Miguelito Perez). On April 29, a title bout between the two teams in Carolina ended in controversy and the championship was declared held up by the promotion. The Batten Twins regained the title in a rematch on May 14, however, they ended up losing the belts to Castillo and Perez in Jayuya, Puerto Rico on June 9, 1989. The Battens would wrestle Castillo and Perez in over 40 times. Brad Batten named The Puerto Rican Express as the best tag team they had ever faced. The tense relationship between the U.S. and Puerto Rican wrestling industries led the Battens to adopt a \\"rebellious\\" attitude towards Carlos Col√≥n and other promoters. During their second Puerto Rican tour, The Battens wrestled in scaffold matches thirteen nights in a row. The brothers would become one of the biggest heel performers in the country during their three-year run. World Championship Wrestling (1990, 1992) Both of the Batten brothers worked in World Championship Wrestling, however, they mostly wrestled separately and as preliminary wrestlers. Brad wrestled three tag team matches on WCW television in the spring and fall of 1990. The first match was with Mark Kyle on the March 2nd edition of World Championship Wrestling wrestling against The Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott Steiner). Six months later, Brad appeared on World Championship Wrestling (aired September 8) with Joe Barrett at the Georgia Mountains Center in Gainesville, Georgia against NWA Tag Team Champions Doom (with Teddy Long). His third and final appearance was on WCW Main Event (aired September 30) where he and Dave Diamond took on \\"The Nature Boy\\" Ric Flair and NWA Television Champion Arn Anderson at the Cobb County Civic Center in Marietta, Georgia. Batten's team lost the match when Anderson hit Batten with a spinebuster and Flair forced him to submit to the figure- four leglock. On March 7, 1992, on WCW Power Hour Bart Batten wrestled \\"Flying\\" Brian Pillman. The Batten Twins first and only appearance as a team was on the March 22nd edition of WCW Main Event at the Civic Center in Anderson, South Carolina against Dustin Rhodes and Barry Windham. The Battens lost when Rhodes pinned one of the twins with his bulldog finisher. Smoky Mountain Wrestling (1992‚Äì1993) With the demise of the NWA territories, The Battens found a home in Smoky Mountain Wrestling. They were among the teams to enter the championship tournament in Harrogate, Tennessee to crown the inaugural SMW Tag Team Champions but were defeated by The Heavenly Bodies (Stan Lane and Tom Prichard) in the opening round. Bart Batten also fell victim to \\"Hollywood\\" Bob Holly's undefeated streak in a singles match the following week. The brothers defeated The Heavenly Bodies via disqualification a month later in Beckley, West Virginia. Their opponents held on to the belts, however, as titles could not change hands by disqualification. Over the next few weeks The Battens racked up victories on SMW television defeating Joe Cazana & Scott Sandlin in Spartanburg, South Carolina and Dutch Mantel & Jimmy Golden in Tazwell, Virginia. They were unable win the tag titles from The Heavenly Bodies in subsequent rematches. On the May 25 episode of Smoky Mountain Wrestling (aired June 20), the Battens told Bob Caudle in a TV interview that the team would temporarily stop pursuing the tag team champions so that The Fantastics (Bobby and Jackie Fulton) could have a title shot now that Jackie Fulton had recovered from a recent injury. The 4th of July edition of Smoky Mountain Wrestling in Cumberland, Kentucky saw a match between The Batten Twins and Dixie Dynamite & Danny Davis end in a no contest when a backstage brawl involving The Heavenly Bodies and The Fantastics disrupted the bout. The following week saw Bart Batten team up with SMW Heavyweight Champion Brian Lee against The Dirty White Boy and \\"Mr. Wonderful\\" Paul Orndorff. Lee replaced one of the Battens following an injury and were awarded the match by disqualification. On August 10, the Battens lost to The Studd Stable (Jimmy Golden and Robert Fuller) at Polk High School in Benton, Tennessee. On the January 30, 1993 episode of Smoky Mountain Wrestling, Brad Batten was the opponent selected to wrestle fellow \\"fan favorite\\" Tracy Smothers for the SMW \\"Beat The Champ\\" Television Championship; his name was drawn from a hat by Dutch Mantell at the beginning of the program. The Batten Twins made their final SMW appearance losing to The Studd Stable in Newton, North Carolina on February 7. The team lost the match when Fuller made one of the twins submit to a surprise \\"Fuller leglock\\" (Inside toe hold leglock). This was the first time the move had been used in the promotion. Bart Batten returned to Newton the following week to face Kevin Sullivan in a singles match. When Sullivan and his partner The Nightstalker began attacking Batten prior to the match, and Sullivan using a metal spike to stab him, Brian Lee and Tim Horner came to Batten's rescue. Return to Puerto Rico (1993) The Battens were working only part-time in SMW in the early-1990s and, as there were very limited spots in its tag team division, they decided to go on another tour of Puerto Rico with the World Wrestling Council. They captured the WWC Tag Team Championship from The Latin Connection (Ray Gonz√°lez and Ricky Santana) in March 1993. On April 2, they jumped to rival Americas Wrestling Federation where they won the promotion's vacant tag team championship and held the belts until the AWF's close in June 1993. On December 3, 1993, wrestling as \\"The Wild Angels\\", the Batten's defeated The Fantastics for Big Time Wrestling's Ohio Tag Team Championship. Smoky Mountain Wrestling (1994‚Äì1995) The Batten Twins returned to SMW in early 1994. Their first match back was against The Moondogs (Moondog Rex and Moondog Spot) in Red Jacket, West Virginia which ended in a double countout. A rematch was held the next night in Hickory, North Carolina, which The Batten Twins lost. They suffered several more defeats at the hands of The Thrillseekers (Chris Jericho and Lance Storm) over the summer. On April 20, 1995, they got a shot at the then reigning SMW Tag Team Champions The Dynamic Duo (Al Snow and Unabomb) in Ashland, Kentucky, and the following night in Spencer, West Virginia, but came up short both times. Independent circuit (1996‚Äì2001) The Batten Twins continued wrestling on the independent circuit after SMW folded. On May 31, 1997, the Battens lost to Terminal Punishment (Allan Funk and Gregg Anderson) in Lorain, Ohio. On August 3, they wrestled Little Guido and Tracy Smothers at a Cleveland All-Pro Wrestling show at Turner's Hall in Cleveland, Ohio. The Batten Twins also defeated Beau James and Frank Murdoch for the Championship Pro Wrestling tag team titles that summer. During this time, the Battens had several run ins with Death & Destruction (Frank \\"The Tank\\" Parker and \\"Ruthless\\" Roger Anderson). A few days after winning the CPW Tag Team Championship, they beat Mountain State Wrestling Association tag champions Death & Destruction in a non-title match. The Battens also occasionally wrestled for Ian Rotten's IWA Mid-South promotion in Louisville, Kentucky. On September 11, The Batten Twins lost to Shark Boy and The Tower Of Doom. A week later, however, they avenged this loss in a Three-Way Dance with American Kickboxer and Tarek the Great. On November 1, The Battens defeated Dark Overlord and Gatekeeper in New Martinsville, West Virginia to become the first Atlantic Coast Championship Wrestling Tag Team Champions. They lost the title to The Country Cousins (Cousin Elmer and R.J. Stomper) and failed to regain the belts in a rematch held in Buckhannon, West Virginia on December 13, 1997. On May 9, 1998, The Battens and The Bushwhackers headlined a show held at Riverside High School in Ellwood City, Pennsylvania. They also worked for the Appalachia Pro Wrestling, where they encountered rivals Death & Destruction, and Nationwide Championship Wrestling where they won the NCW Tag Team Championship. In April 2001, The Batten Twins wrestled John Noble and Stan Lane in Hardeeville, South Carolina. Noble counted his matches with The Battens among the favorites of his career. The brothers also assisted promoter Scotty Ace produce NCW's weekly television show. They were living in Huntington, West Virginia at the time and had to travel the furthest of the entire roster. That same year, The Batten Twins appeared on an episode of The Jerry Springer Show posting as brothers who were secretly dating a woman unaware that they were identical twins. They were among several Southern independent wrestlers used as \\"guests\\" for the show. Southern States Wrestling (2001‚Äì2003) The Batten Twins began competing for Southern States Wrestling based in Kingsport, Tennessee. On March 20, 2001, they beat Beau James and K.C. Thunder for the SSW Tag Team Championship. Aligned with Scotty Ace, the Battens continued feuding with James and Thunder throughout the year. At the second annual Mark Curtis Weekend of Champions, they defeated James and Thunder in a Steel Cage \\"loser leaves town\\" match thanks in part to outside interference from Scotty Ace and Ricky Harrison who \\"turned heel\\" by attacking his former allies. The Batten Twins lost the belts to The Heartbreakers (Andy Douglas and Kelly Charles) on June 1 but regained them two months later. The team defended the NCW and SSW Tag Team Championships while competing in both promotions. On September 3, they successfully defended both belts against Jimmy Valiant and Flex Armstrong at an NCW show in Huntington, West Virginia. Their feud with K.C. Thunder continued into the fall. On October 13, The Batten Twins and their allies Ricky Harrison and Scotty Ace were beaten in an 8-man tag team match against Beau James, KC Thunder, PJ Sharp and Steve Flynn; the brothers had also defended their NCW/SSW titles against Ray Idol and Tony Givens that same night. They remained champions for only two more weeks when they were defeated in Kingsport by K.C. Thunder and Steve Flynn on October 27, 2001. Independent circuit (2002) In 2002, The Battens began wrestling for the Mid-South Wrestling Alliance out of Oak Hill and Blue Ridge Wrestling out of Princeton, West Virginia, alongside another former SMW veteran \\"Player\\" Brian Logan. On August 3, 2002, The Batten Twins lost to Death & Destruction at a Mason-Dixon Wrestling show for the Blackberry Festival in Nutter Fort, West Virginia. The two teams met again in Williamson, West Virginia three months later where The Batten Twins defeated Death & Destruction following a wild 4-way brawl. On August 15, they defeated the \\"New\\" West Virginia Wrecking Crew (Danny Ray and Scott McComas) in a tournament final to become the first-ever MSWA Tag Team Champions. The Batten Twins retained the title against The Rebel and Jamie Bolen in Marsh Fork on September 7 but they were stripped of the titles on October 19, 2002 when they failed to appear for a scheduled title defense in Smithers, West Virginia. Southern States Wrestling (2003) The Battens won the SSW Tag Team Championship for a third and final time when they beat Thorn and Tim Baldwin in Kingsport on March 22, 2003. At the two-day Mark Curtis Weekend of Champions, Bart Batten defeated Thorn in a singles match by disqualification and later on the team retained their title against Thorn and Flex Armstrong. After a near nine month title reign, the Battens dropped the belts back to Thorn and Baldwin on September 3. The following night, Brad Batten defeated Jesse Taylor for the SSW Heavyweight Championship. He decided to forfeit the title and officially surrendered the belt to promoter Beau James a month later. In one of his last SSW appearances, Brad Batten joined Ray Idol and Jimmy Golden in a 6-man tag team match to beat K.C. Thunder, Nightmare and Super Destroyer in Greeneville, Tennessee on September 20, 2003. Independent circuit (2003‚Äì2004) By the early-2000s, for the most part, The Batten Twins stayed within West Virginia working for local independent promotions such as American International Wrestling, Independent Pro Wrestling, Mid South Wrestling Alliance, Mountain State Wrestling, Mountaineer Pro Wrestling and Nationwide Championship Wrestling. They trained future NWA star Jason \\"The Gift\\" Kincaid during this time. They did, however, travel to Ashland, Kentucky on May 23, 2003, to take part in a benefit show for the family of Tyler Dietrich who were struggling to pay expensive medical bills after their young son was diagnosed with cancer. This One's For Tyler involved wrestlers from seven different independent promotions including Nationwide Championship Wrestling and Ohio Championship Wrestling. The Batten Twins were part of a six-man tag match with Cuzin Elwood against The Poachers and Vic the Bruiser. On July 24, The Batten Twins lost to Mike Woods and Gary Valiant by disqualification at a NWA Main Event TV taping in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. In January 2004, The Batten Twins briefly feuded with Jared and Bitch Lancaster in Mountain State Wrestling. On February 6, 2004, they fought to a double- disqualification against Johnny Blast and Cuban Assassin #2 in Minnora, West Virginia. A March 16 bout against The Memphis Mafia ended in a no-contest.

On April 28, The Batten Twins were defeated by Eric St. Clair and George South in Fayetteville, West Virginia. On September 21, 2004, The Batten Twins defeated Lance Erikson and Stan Lee by disqualification at a MPW show in Oak Hill. Retirement tour (2005) In April 2005, the Batten Twins announced their retirement and would be going on one last wrestling tour throughout their home state of West Virginia. The reason behind their decision to retire was partly because the brothers \\"didn't want to be a Gypsy Joe\\" and risk serious injury due to their ages. Brad Batten had also met a woman in Cleveland, Ohio and wanted to move out of the state to live with her. The two were married three years later. On May 21, 2005, The Batten Twins wrestled their last match with Bart‚Äôs son, Brent Batten, defeating \\"Superstar\\" Shane Matthews, Chris Vega and J.V. Insanity in Bradley, West Virginia. Post- retirement While his brother left for Cleveland, Bart continued to be involved in the local independent circuit. He was the color commentator for the Bluefield, West Virginia-based All Pro Wrestling and hosted Network West Virginia's Monday night show Mountain State Wrestling TV. On July 5, 2014, Bart Batten appeared with fellow Smokey Mountain Wrestling alumni Bobby Blaze, Jim Cornette and Mick Foley for Bluegrass Championship Wrestling's \\"Rumble on the River\\" show in Ashland, Kentucky. Brad Batten left West Virginia after retiring from pro wrestling. He later settled in Crestline, Ohio where he lived with his wife for several years. Batten died at the Ohio State University Medical Center on November 18, 2014 after suffering a sudden heart attack near his home. The news was announced by the World Wrestling Council on its official Facebook page. On January 21, 2015, Bart Batten was a guest on the World Domination with Terry Garvin Simms podcast with retired wrestler Terry Simms. He discussed his reaction to Brad's death and revealed that both of them had become born again Christians after they had split up. It was not until Bart Batten called up his brother that he discovered they had unknowingly done so on exactly the same day. Bart talked about training with the Poffo family in ICW and their NWA career during the 1980s wrestling boom. He was also very critical of the modern wrestling industry and blamed Vince McMahon for \\"destroying the [NWA] territories\\". Both Garvin and Downtown Bruno have maintained that the Battens would have been major stars had they been given the opportunity by the bigger territories.

Saboba, Chereponi and Nanumba Districts, Gushiegu and Karaga districts, Zabzugu and Tatale-Sanguli districts in the Northern Region and the Nkwanta North and South Districts in the Volta Region are a few examples of administrative districts where Bikpakpaam are seen in huge populations. Other key towns of Bikpakpaam in Ghana are Atebubu, Kintampo, Techiman and Yeji in the Brong Ahafo Region. According to the Act 280 of the Anatomy act of Ghana, the Konkomba people (known as Bikpakpaam) are the second largest ethnic group in the Northern Region of Ghana. The 2010 census data indicates that Bikpakpaam in Ghana number 823,000 and applying the intercensal growth rate would give a population of more than one million now. CIA The World Factbook reports in Demographics of Ghana that Konkomba people are the 8th largest Ethnic group in Ghana representing 3.5% of the Total population of Ghana. Saboba (Chabob) in the Northern Region of Ghana is the capital town of all Bikpakpaam in Ghana. Bikpakpaam are also found in the republic of Togo, a sister West African country to Ghana. In Togo Bikpakpaam reside mainly in the Kara, Central and Plateaux Regions. Guerin Kouka (a.k.a. Nanguem Do, the capital of Dankpen district) in the Kara Region is the capital town of Bikpakpaam in Togo. Dankpen district is located in the north western corridor of Togo. In Schwartz's (2005) account, Bikpakpaam number about 50,100 in Togo. The 2011 census in Togo indicates however that the total population of Bikpakpaam in Dankpen district alone was 122,209.

All Konkomba settlements are led by a traditional chief called Ubor.Njindan, Bernard. 2014. Konkomba People in Ghana: A Historical Perspective. Unpublished Manuscript. July, 2014. In Bikpakpaam dominant areas, the people have instituted or established their own chieftains who serve as overlords of the settlements. For instance, the Saboba area has the Uchabob-bor as the overlord. Bikpakpaam strongly believe in solidarity, determination and hard-work. Until the turn of the 21st century, their primary occupation was farming and animal husbandry. In occupational terms, Bikpakpaam are mainly subsistence farmers and rearers of animals such as poultry, small ruminants and cattle. This, probably, explains their scattered settlement across the West African sub-region. Indeed, Maasole Maasole, S. C. 2006. The Konkomba and their Neighbours from the pre-European period to 1914: A study in inter-ethnic relations in Northern Ghana. Accra: Ghana Universities Press. intimates that Bikpakpaam have always been on the move, in search for fertile farmlands. Most Konkombas are actively in education today and a recent research projects that Konkombas will become a dominant force in politics, health, education and the civil society by 2025.  Origin and ethnogenesis  The Konkomba natively refer to themselves as Bikpakpaam (plural form) and to their language as Likpakpaln. A male member of the tribe is denoted as ukpakpaanja while a female takes ukpakpaanpii. However, the anglicized form, ‚ÄòKonkomba‚Äô has been the term commonly used to refer to both the people and the language. Bikpakpaam are an aboriginal people of northern Ghana. Rattray (1932) talks of Bikpakpaam as an important ethnic grouping in the northern territories of Ghana.Rattray, R. S. (1932). The Tribes of the Ashanti Hinterlands, 1. Oxford: Clarendon Press. Maasole (2006) also described Bikpakpaam as, ‚Äòaboriginal‚Äô people of Northern Ghana.Maasole, S. C. 2006. The Konkomba and their Neighbours from the pre-European period to 1914: A study in inter-ethnic relations in Northern Ghana. Accra: Ghana Universities Press. Before the arrival of many other ethnic groups in the northern regions of Ghana in the 1400s and 1500s, Bikpakpaam were already settled in the area.Martinson, H. B. (1995). The Hidden History of Konkomba Wars in Northern Ghana. Ghana: Nyagse Foundation. Visit Konkomba language to learn more (genetic root, alphabets, phonetic...) about the Likpakpaln (Konkomba language).  Origin and History  The origin of Bikpakpaam has been a subject of research for a long time now. It is on record that Bikpakpaam settled more widely in the eastern corridor before the arrival of many other ethnic groups in the northern regions of Ghana in the 1400s and 1500s,.Martinson, H. B. (1995). The Hidden History of Konkomba Wars in Northern Ghana. Ghana: Nyagse Foundation. Bikpakpaam then migrated into other territories in the first half of twentieth century, partly occasioned by colonial pressures and partly in search of fertile farmlands. This opened the door for other tribes to enter and occupy their lands. The history of where Bikpakpaam came from to settle in Ghana is not well known. What is known, however, is that Bikpakpaam occupied the area called Kyali/Chare (now Yendi) until the Dagombas advanced further east with their expansion and pushed them further away with the support of the colonial masters. Fynn (1971) asserts 'we know that the ancestors of the Dagombas met a people akin to the Konkomba already living in northern Ghana‚Äô. According to narratives by elders of Kikpakpaan, the Gonjas, under Ndewura Jakpa, defeated Dagombas under Ya Na Dariziogo and compelled the latter to abandon their capital (currently believed to be Tamale/Kumbungu areas) and move it to its present site, Yendi, which was then a Bikpakpaam town called Chare. The newcomers pushed back Bikpakpaam and established divisions among them. Despite the assertion of suzerainty, Dagombas seem never to have exercised close control over Bikpakpaam.Brukum N.J.K, 2001: The Guinea Fowl, Mango and Pito Wars: Episodes in the history of Northern Ghana, 1980-1999. Accra, Ghana Universities Press. According to Martin (1976), the Dagombas pushed back the Konkomba and established divisional chiefs among them. The main towns had the character of outposts, strategically located on the east bank of the River Oti but Bikpakpaam were by no means assimilated. Relations between them and the Dagombas were distant and hostile. There was little, if any, mixing by marriage. Part of the oral history of the creation of Dagbon suggests that the Dagombas conquered Bikpakpaam when they moved into the eastern part of the Northern Region. Bikpakpaam however have vehemently and consistently refused the claim that they were in the battle against Dagombas. The Konkomba have often insisted that they voluntarily moved away, in search for fertile lands and greener pastures for their livestock, when Dagombas arrived. David Tait (1964) quotes an elder of Bikpakpaam as saying ‚ÄúWhen we were growing up and met our fathers, they told us they (our forefathers) stayed in Yaan/Chare (Yendi) with the Kabre and Bikwom. The Dagombas at the time lived mainly in Tamale and Kumbungu from where they rose, mounted their horses and moved towards Yendi‚Äù. We saw the horses and had to move further east.David Tait (1964): The Konkomba of Northern Ghana. London: Oxford University Press. Published for the International African Institute and the University of Ghana by the Oxford University Press  Pre-colonial and modern day organization  Bikpakpaam pre-colonial political organization was centered on districts inhabited by clans whose status and autonomy were represented through the presence of ubor (chief) and an earth-shrine tendered by a religious leader, utindaan (the earth priest). Ubor is the administrative and judiciary leader of Bikpakpaam communities. The main duties of ubor include (but not limited to) maintaining peace, unity, order, justice and liaise with other chiefs to maintain harmony and settle conflicts and disputes. Utindaan, is an important figure not only among Bikpakpaam, but also among the other tribes of Ghana, especially among ‚ÄòGur‚Äô ethnic groups. This term Utindaan means the keeper of the land, to some and to others, it means the first settler on the land. Literary it means the ‚Äúland owner.‚Äù The utindaan had and continues to have overlordship of an entire settlement, more in the exercise of spiritual duties and powers over the place. Ubor and utindaan work together to sell or apportion land to individuals. Historically, the earth priest (utindaan) first settled in the ancient town of Kyali/Chare, present Yendi in the Northern Region. In modern days, the duties of ubor have been extended. Ubor is the mouth piece of the people, giving authorization and approval for development activities. Ubor works hand-in-hand with the political, non-governmental, and religious leaders to ensure the welfare and development of the entire community. The chief's palace (kinakok) is the first point of call for any government agency or development partner visiting the community for development or any other purpose. Kinakok is a highly respected and prestigious office having a linguist ubonabr a.k.a. (wunlaan), a scribe (ugbangmeer), a chief priest, council of elders, foot soldiers, body guards and servants. Ubor is the head and chief executive officer of kinakok. Kinakok also serves as a traditional court yard for settlement of conflicts and disputes. Fines are often imposed on guilty individuals for a peaceful settlement of conflicts and disputes. Culturally ubor is polygamous because many women are betrothed onto him from various clans. Next to the authority of the utindaan was the uninkpel, a clan head. The position of uninkpel is almost invariably reserved for the most elderly man of a clan. Each Bikpakpaam clan has an uninkpel who also oversees the affairs of his clan. Uninkpel and utindaan work hand-in-hand and report to ubor who is the boss. The developmental social structure of Bikpakpaam boast of youth leadership known as KOYA (Konkomba Youth Association). KOYA functions mainly in uniting Bikpakpaam, promoting peace and development among Bikpakpaam, educating Bikpakpaam on the importance of education and also on the need to do away with outdated cultural practices. KOYA also mediate inter and intra-tribal conflict resolution. KOYA has many branches across Bikpakpaam settlements in Ghana and foreign branches in U.S.A. and United Kingdom. Bikpakpaam also have a leader for the youth and young adults called unachiponbor (young chief). Unachiponbor coordinates and promotes peace, unity and communalism among the youth. He ensures that all young men and women get adequate support from other youth during marriage ceremonies, He also leads the young men to plow farmlands for parents-in-law (as part of dowry) in the form of communal labor. Unachiponbor also leads his fellow youth to dig the grave of a parent-in-law, and offer a befitting kinachung during the funerals of a parent-in-law.  Bikpakpaam Culture  Bikpakpaam Beliefs: The Bikpakpaam have many beliefs just as other tribes. Bikpakpaam believe in the existence of a Supreme Being ‚ÄòUwumbor‚Äô (God) who is upheld as the uncreated creator of everything. Uwumbor controls all things and delegates power to other smaller gods and spirit beings under Him to take care of prescribed creatures. Bikpakpaam also believe that Uwumbor gives each individual his own destiny and no one has powers to change his or her own destiny or the destiny of another person. God the creator is the only one who knows one's destiny. There is also the belief among the Bikpakpaam that God created every person and it is God alone who can direct the trajectory of life of the individual or determine his or her life span. If one has not completed the assigned purpose for him or her on earth, God would never take him back i.e. God will not let the person die, but if it happens, God will let the person reincarnate to complete the assignment. Such reincarnated persons have special identifiable names such as Jagri (a reincarnated male), Piigri (a reincarnated female), N-ya (my grandmother), for reincarnated female, N-yaja (my grandfather) for a reincarnated male. Bikpakpaam believe that there are evil spirits which torment people in the form of sickness, poverty, conflicts, drought, still births, deformities, deaths, mental disorders etc. They also believe in the existence of counter spirits (good ones), which counteract the attacks of the evil spirits. Furthermore, Bikpakpaam believe in ancestral spirits (the existence of the spirit of the dead), which they call Bitekpiib. They are of the view that these ancestral spirits take vengeance on enemies, protects the rest of the family and care for the general well being of the surviving relations. They, thence, pour libation and perform sacrifices to appease the ancestral spirits.Banyubala, D.N., Posthumous Organ Retention and Use in Ghana: Regulating Individual, Familial and Societal Interests. Health Care Anal, 2014 These indigenous Bikpakpaam beliefs are fading out and giving way to Christianity and Islam. Most Bikpakpaam of post-colonial era have embraced Christianity and believe in the Triune God (the Father, Son and Holy Spirit). As such, Saboba and other Bikpakpaam localities are home to many denominational churches including the Catholic Church, Orthodox, Pentecostal and Charismatic churches. About 5% or less of Bikpakpaam are Muslims. Bikpakpaam hospitality:Bikpakpaam are friendly and welcoming people. Renowned for their hospitality, a typical Bikpakpaam family will take in visitors, offer them water to drink, and slaughter a domestic bird or small ruminant to prepare a meal for the visitor. They make visitors feel at home and part of their family. They also give souvenirs and livestock for keeping to their visitors. Bikpakpaam relate cordially with their neighbors and show great respect to everyone without discrimination. They often treat visitors or guests better than they treat themselves. Bikpakpaam boast of a rich diversity of art works and traditional costumes. The art work and colorful and fancy indigenous costumes of traditional dances (kinachung, njeem, ichaa, tibaln, nbanba etc.) make Saboba and other Bikpakpaam settlements and environs a thrilling and rewarding tourist destination to explore. Inheritance among the Bikpakpaam: Bikpakpaam inheritance is patrilineal. Every child of Kikpakpaan belongs to the father's lineage and will inherit properties of his/her father. The patrilineal inheritance, however, shows great reverence and respect to the maternal relationships, which is mainly seen and used as a second home for the child and also as a place of asylum in times of patrilineal hostilities. Mothers and children also use the maternal families as a prolific ground for investments. The paternal family pays great homage to the maternal family by plowing one of their fields into farmland every year for free. In addition, the maternal families are entitled to a lavish and honorable parent-in-law funeral sponsored by the paternal family. The Ingenuity of Bikpakpaam: Bikpakpaam are clever and innovative in their traditional settings. Inventions by the forefathers of Bikpakpaam include farm implements/tools, musical instruments, hunting tools/weapons such as liluul, butom, ilopiin, kakpola, kitaln etc., Their architectural and construction prowess and techniques led to domestic structures like libubul, lipil, kachala, kikpawung, and n-yaam (for painting), tinabin (cow dung) (for plastering houses) etc. Some musical instruments are liwul (flute), kibeek (guitar), ligangaln (drum), kiwujabik (type of flute), lidabuln (type of drum) and ukpiihn (horn). Cultural costumes include unaa (decorated horns), tangana (traditional cloth), tanbena (dancing cloth decorated with beads and pearls), tibaan (jingles) etc., Household utensils/detergents include libuul (clay coolers), nkin (clay pot), sagbo (jar), kiyiik (calabash), bukpakpaankiib (traditional soap) among others. Bravery and hardwork of Bikpakpaam: The core values of Bikpakpaam include: bravery, hard work, determination, generosity, hospitality, courage, and collectivism, love of family life and support for family members. This hard working attribute evolved as a component of their culture which requires every adolescent to work hard enough to plow their own farm land and that of their parents in the same season in order to become economically independent and raise their own families. In their hay days, typical Bikpakpaam farmers will plow their own yam farm manually, boasting of 15,000-20,000 yam mounds yearly. This is evident in the fact that Bikpakpaam are the major yam producers in Ghana and Togo. In Ghana, Bikpakpaam are proud to feed the nation and even export yam through the Konkomba Yam Market in Agbogbloshie, Accra. In addition to yam farming, Bikpakpaam farmers also boast of maize, guinea corn, and millet and rice farms. Bikpakpaam women care for the men as they plow the fields, but also plow their own fields where they grow mainly vegetables and legumes (groundnuts, and beans). Women also gather fruits for economic gain namely shea nuts (used to make shea butter) and dawadawa fruits, which have a diversified use. Bikpakpaam women are also excellent in harvest and post harvest processing and marketing of foodstuff. Gathering of firewood and charcoal production for both domestic and commercial use are integral part of Bikpakpaam women duties. The brewing of a local drink known as ndamam (‚Äúred drink‚Äù) popularly known as pito is a natural gift and preserve of women. Animal rearing is also practiced by Bikpakpaam for domestic consumption and commercial purposes. Such animals include birds (fowls, guinea fowls, ducks, and doves), ruminants (mainly goats, sheep, and cattle) and pigs. In recent times, some farmers have delved into guinea pig, grasscutter and rabbit farming for commercial purposes. Bikpakpaam farmers also now boast of large plantations of fruit trees, mainly mango and cashew trees. The practice of collective solidarity in the form of communal labor termed as nkpawiin depicts hardwork, unity and collaboration among Bikpakpaam communities.Acedo-Carmona, C. and A. Gomila, Deciding to Cooperate in Northern Ghana: Trust as an Evolutionary Constraint Across Cultural Diversity. Span J Psychol, 2015. 18: p. E91. Here, individuals seek help from the entire community to meet labour needs (farming, construction and other forms of work) and this occurs in turns. Bikpakpaam are swift, brave and security conscious. Bikpakpaam foods and drinks: Bikpakpaam eat what they grow/farm/rear. Bikpakpaam foods are very healthy and reflect in their healthy conditions. Their staple foods include ‚ÄúBisatom‚Äù (literarly, ‚Äúhot food‚Äù) commonly known in Ghana as ‚Äútuo zafi‚Äù (TZ), ‚Äúsak…îla‚Äù commonly known in Ghana as ‚Äúfufu‚Äù made with pounded yam, ‚Äúlikaal/kalaa/tubani‚Äù made with beans flour, millet and a combination of many other foods. In their quest to achieve a balanced diet, the forefathers of Bikpakpaam discovered a wide range of healthy vegetables; some of which are indigenous but others are well known and common in other areas. These include but not limited to: ‚Äúimuan‚Äù (okra), ‚Äútinyangban‚Äù (hibiscus), ‚Äúkijuuk(English name not identified)‚Äù, ‚Äútimonfar‚Äù (okra leaves), ‚Äúlikpakajul‚Äù (sesame leaves), ‚Äúlitukal‚Äù (baobab leaves), ‚Äúkikotumok (English name not identified)‚Äù, ‚Äútignaafar (English name not identified) ‚Äúinangbanatun (English name not identified)‚Äù, tigbufar (kapok leaves), ‚Äúsuwaka‚Äù, (bitter leaves), ‚Äúunaa‚Äù (spinach) and many more. These vegetables are used to prepare soup, stews or as sides in combination with the staple foods. The ingenious, original and authentic Bikpakpaam drink is called ‚ÄúPito‚Äù. Pito is a delicious traditional beer brewed from scratch using organic guinea corn with natural ingredients and no artificial flavors and no preservatives. Pito is brewed fermented or non-fermented. The fermented Pito is excellent for ‚Äúhappy hour‚Äù, funerals, parties and other celebrations. Non-fermented Pito is consumed as a beverage for various purposes. The rich diversity of Bikpakpaam foods can also boast of tubers like yam, cassava, potato and grains like maize, millet, guinea corn, ‚Äúipui‚Äù, and rice, sesame seeds (‚Äúkpaka‚Äù and ‚Äújam-jam‚Äù) melon seeds (‚Äúinabe‚Äù and ‚Äúkeer‚Äù) and many more. Bikpakpaam names: Bikpakpaam believe the name one bears influences his/her life. Good names bring success and prosperity to a person. As such, great care is taken in choosing names for children. Bikpakpaam naming world is vast as it incorporates all categories of names- circumstantial, positional, proverbial, ironical and rhetoric as well as flora and fauna names etc. Some of the names given to children are indicative of special event(s) associated with a child's birth or inspired by special thought or wishes by relations. Names among Bikpakpaan can also be proverbial or insinuative in response to surrounding situations and/or circumstances or conveying a message to neighbors/relatives. This rich naming system render Bikpakpaam names very unique and attractive in appellation. Culturally, the mother's parents/family choose the name given to the 1st born of every woman and the man's parents/family, or the husband and wife choose the name given to subsequent children based on mutual consent. When a child is born, a fowl is sent to the woman's family as a gift to announce the birth of the child. A male poultry indicates the child is a male child and vice versa. The essence of this gift is to start an investment for he child's future. Few days-weeks later a special day is set aside to name the child, amidst merry making (eating, drinking, singing, and dancing‚Ä¶..). Examples of Konkomba names and their meanings: Tanamwir: Our Kingdom is great Wumborja: The Lord our defense N-Muanbindo: There is joy in my house Barkei: ‚Äúpatience‚Äù Ndonbi: I am thankful to them Wumborgnan: God is good Wumborkan: God has seen Banyubala: They do not boast Bilinsun: They have forgotten what they said Nkumpoi: Death is stubborn Tabime: Do not denigrate me Biyakakumi: If only they spare my life Ulanja: ‚Äújovial‚Äù Iwunliin: Destiny Ujakpa: ‚Äústrong like a shark‚Äù Wumborti: God's gift Wumborbe: God lives Nsimbaan: One blood Nsanyaan: The good way Nignan: It is good Kajah: Born under a shed or summer hut Bindan: They should come Other names: Dana and Dawon: Males twins Pona and Powon: Female twins Nakoja: Male born after twins Nakol: Female born after twins Napari: Second born after twins (both male and female) Sanja: Male born on the road during a commute Sanpu: Female born on the road during a commute Jabaab: Male twin whose twin brother/sister dies before the naming ceremony. Pibaab: Female twin whose twin brother/sister dies before the naming ceremony Bikpakpaam Housing: Since the pre-colonial era, many Bikpakpaam families live together in their traditional family houses. When the young men and women are grown and get married they leave the family house to establish their own families. The houses are made of round or rectangular rooms built, from laterite (clay) and roofed with thatch. Bikpakpaam women boast of invention of the traditional paint known as n-yam made from Dawadawa fruit pod and used for painting and decorating interior of rooms. Post-colonial developments led to the introduction of cemented brick and block and cemented houses, roofed with zinc sheets. Some traditional rites of Bikpakpaam Marriage rites: Bikpakpaam marriages have evolved along several pillars. The traditional betrothal and exchange marriage types have made way to a more open and unrestricted marriage system. Nonetheless, the customs accompanying these marriages have remained. In the current marriage system, the groom's family farms and contributes severally in the form of dowry to the bride's family. These numerous contributions have now been reduced drastically to just a simple dowry paid to the bride family subject to the financial strength of the groom's family. The bride's family also submits a list of items (clothing, kitchen and household items) to the groom's family to purchase for the bride. In the betrothal system, females at infancy or childhood were betrothed to, sometimes, aged adult men who wait for them to grow for marriage. This practice is outdated and no longer in use because betrothed women who did not like their betrothed husbands deserted the marriage and absconded and sometimes committed suicide. The marriages of today are constructed between individual lovers who after falling into a relationship introduce the prospective spouses to their families for assessment and acceptance. Before marriage, the lady also usually visits the man's home temporary (to study and in turn, be assessed by the man's family) and later, permanently moves to the home when the marriage has been contracted. Christianity has influenced this modern trend in current marriage system among Bikpakpaam. Another prominent phenomenon that is waning in Bikpakpaam marriage system is polygyny. Formerly, a typical ukpakpanja could marry more than one wife, depending on his social and financial strength. Now due to Christianity, economic hardship, rivalry and modernity, the polygamy is fading out and most men now marry just one wife and a maximum of two except biborb (chiefs) who still marry many wives betrothed onto them by clans and well wishers. In a typical Bikpakpaam community today, one may still find cases where a woman may marry a relative of her deceased husband. Burial rites: Bikpakpaam traditionally bury their dead within a maximum of 24 hours post death (aside the recent introduction of keeping corpses in the morgue and burial with coffin). When a person, whether a child or an adult dies, messages such as verbal, horn/flute sound and explosive gunpowder (for older people) are sent to neighbors in the surrounding communities and to relatives far and near. For adult men and women (married and having children), kinachung always accompanies the burial services. Infants, children and adolescents receive a similar burial without kinachung and, many a time, without a coffin. The deceased is laid in state and burial rites are performed. There is mourning (ikpowiil), ikpolahn (dirges), njeem, etc. based on the cause of death or status of the deceased. The corpse is bathed by a large number of women, dressed and may be coffined. The corpse (coffined or not) is carried by men on the shoulder or head and one of the traditional priest invokes ancestral spirits to identify the cause of death. The corpse is then sent to the gravesite, which is usually in front of the house for adults and far away from home for kids and adolescents. Causes of death like drowning, bush fires, death in pregnancy, death of a twin all have special rites. Males are buried facing the sunrise (east) to remind them of daybreak and onset of farming activities whilst females face sunset (west) to remind them of end-of-day to do household chores and prepare diner for the whole family. As indicated both burial positions have cultural connotations. A few farewell tributes including the gift of money, valuables and verbal messages are said to the deceased before interment. Kinachung and other funeral rites continue after the burial ceremony. Funeral rites: Bikpakpaam have two main forms of funeral rites. Just as the burial rites, these are also primed on the cause of death and status of the deceased. There is a three days (males) or four days (females) post-burial funeral rite during which the clothes of the deceased are washed by female relatives. This is seen as a minor event. The first funeral rite is called Lisaatong (literally -putting food on table) is performed for only adults. It is characterized by converging of relatives, neighbors and sympatizers at the funeral grounds to serve food to the spirit of the dead. A four-legged animal (usually a cow) is slaughtered and a sumptuous meal (bisatom) is prepared for all but a plate of the meal is served and left in the room of the deceased person overnight to feed and calm his/her spirit, which otherwise is believed will pester the living by scavenging the kitchen for food every night. For hospitality, many other animals can be slaughtered, including cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and fowls and food (bisatom) is served to all visitors and sympatizers. Night and day kinachung and ichaa, ngben dances are performed. During these dances, food and drinks (Pito, soda, tea....) are served to all visitors and accommodation provided where need be. The last and final funeral rite is what is termed Likpuul (funeral proper). This can be after a few days or weeks or months for a kid or after several years for adults, especially utindaan. Just like Lisaach‚ÜÑng, likpuul involves convergence of relatives and sympathizers. The Bikpakpaam pito drinks are prepared and served, and many animals (more than during the lisaach‚ÜÑng) are slaughtered to cater for the masses of funeral attendants. This usually takes 5-7days and is performed for an accumulated number of deceased people. On the 3rd day, ubua (a soothsayer) consults the deceased as well the ancestors of the deceased to speak to the relatives about the cause of their death and other family/communal issues that need spiritual redress. Kinachung and other dances are performed over the entire likpuul program. Additional rites like the widowhood and orphan hood rites as well as inheritance are usually performed in the last few days of likpuul. Christianity has influenced all these funeral rites simplified and reduced to a burial church service in 3 days (men) or 4 days (women). At the bereaved family's discretion, a date is set aside for the final funeral rite. Usually there is wake keeping on Friday, a funeral church service on Saturday and a thanksgiving church service on Sunday marking the end of the funeral. Ndinpondaan festival Ndipondaan (literally meaning; new guineacorn drink) Festival is currently the most widely celebrated festival among Bikpakpaam. Others like the fire festival (naminsee) and the new yam festivals (n-nidak) are less celebrated today due to foreign cultural influences and modernity. Currently, efforts are underway to revive and bring back the celebration of these festivals. Ndipondaan festival is celebrated by Bikpakpaam to thank almighty God, ancestors and the gods for a bumper harvest of guinea corn and other food crops. This festival is recently attracting public attention. This is an annual event during which there is homecoming for all Bikpakpaam in the world over to Saboba, their capital. During Ndipondaan, many events, including games, dancing competitions and other cultural rites are revised and performed. Opportunity from this event is used in tracing ancestral lineages of individuals, visits to major Bikpakpaam landmarks, tourism activities and re-union of families. Other educational and sensitization programmes and projects are initiated or delivered during Ndipondaan celebration. Issues that affect Kikpkakpaan are addressed and communities or their representatives advised accordingly. Ndipondaan also serves as a time of mediation of internal differences and settlement of outstanding conflicts. One consistent ritual, however, has been an opening prayer to almighty God, a word of exhortation from the clergy, the performance of libation and sacrifice to ancestors, traditional dance, and the sharing of food and drinks with visitors and relatives. Many Bikpakpaam delicacies, including bisaatom, and sak‚ÜÑla are prepared and eaten. Pito, the favorite guineacorn drink is also brewed in large quantities and enjoyed by all.

She is a war captain under Immortan Joe but turns against him in order to free \\"The Five Wives\\", Joe's female concubines (or \\"breeders\\"). She meets Max Rockatansky during her journey and, despite initial hostility, the two become allies and team up to drive The Five Wives to a safe environment called The Green Place. She considers Max \\"reliable\\". Films Mad Max: Fury Road Imperator Furiosa is introduced early in the film during a speech made by Immortan Joe, during which she is shown to work logistics for Joe's citadel, specifically charged with the task of ferrying oil from Gas Town to the Citadel. To expedite the process Furiosa is granted command over a small outfit of Warboys ‚Äì men who serve as Joe's armed force ‚Äì and entrusted with the \\"war rig\\", a heavily armed and armored tractor- trailer truck complete with a tri-axle tanker trailer capable of towing an additional fuel tank trailer (or \\"pod\\"). After being dispatched to Gas Town, Furiosa abruptly changes course and heads off the road, precipitating a battle in which Furiosa shows her combat and tactical skills, defending the tanker truck from scavengers and later from a party of Warboys sent out to stop her. After meeting with Max the two end up working together, drawing on their respective experiences surviving in hostile environments to overcome the challenges of fighting against Immortan Joe's forces. Eventually, Furiosa reaches her birthplace, whereupon she is received as one of the Vuvalini of Many Mothers. In a subsequent council, Furiosa initially opts to join the Vuvalini in their trek across the salt flats to find a new home, but is persuaded to return to the Citadel by Max when he points out that it is the closest known source of water. More importantly, Max points out that with the bulk of Joe's forces engaged in pursuing Furiosa, Joe's Citadel is unlikely to be well manned against an incursion. Capitalizing on this opportunity, Furiosa leads the rag-tag group of rebels back to the Citadel, in the process engaging in a running battle with several groups of vehicles manned by the Warboys. Ultimately, Furiosa is able to board Joe's truck and slays the dictator. Upon returning to the citadel in Joe's truck, Max displays Joe's dead body, resulting in widespread admiration for Furiosa and her exploits. She is last seen ascending into the citadel on a lift used to move vehicles into and out of the facility. Future One of the scripts completed for a Fury Road sequel was entitled Mad Max: Furiosa, and George Miller hoped to film it after the release of Fury Road. However, in a 2015 interview, Miller said: > I'm not sure, is the answer. She's not in the Mad Max [sequel] story, but in > one of the stories, there's an interaction between [Max and Furiosa]. I > can't really say more than that because it's still in progress. In October 2020 it was confirmed that Anya Taylor-Joy would play as a young Furiosa in a Furiosa Stand-Alone prequel movie. Equipment Furiosa's attire Furiosa has a mechanical left arm. Mad Max: Fury Road does not explain how Furiosa lost her arm. Furiosa drives the War Rig, a fast and powerful truck that is the main vehicle which she, Max, and the Five Wives use in their attempt to escape Immortan Joe and arrive in the Green Place. She is also armed with a handgun and an SKS rifle. Personality Furiosa is a strong- willed and moral leader. She takes the initiative to save the Five Wives from Immortan Joe with little regard for her own well-being and without any desire for reward, save for redemption. She aims to take the Wives to the Green Place, but when she encounters her kin, they tell her that the soil had turned to poison and nothing would grow, and it became a fetid swamp with little more than crows and mud. Her relationship with Max inspires her to return to the Citadel and take it over after killing Immortan Joe, giving the Five Wives and all citizens a safe haven. In an interview, Charlize Theron revealed that Furiosa was originally to be a wife of the Imperator, but was infertile: \\"[George Miller and I] talked about backstory, about how she ended up with no arm and that she was discarded. She couldn't breed, and that was all that she was good for. She was stolen from this place, this green place that she's trying to go back to. But she was kind of embedded in [the Citadel] for one thing, and when she couldn't deliver on that one thing, she was discarded ‚Äì and she didn't die. And instead... she hid out with those war pups in the world of mechanics, and they almost forgot she was a woman because she grew up like them.\\" Furiosa has been credited with being a positive feminist action hero. Kyle Smith of the New York Post declared that Furiosa was the true main character of Fury Road, not Max, and that she was both smarter and more adaptable than Hardy's character: \\"Theron's character is tough, but she's primarily a driver, not a martial-arts champion. In a scene in which Max tries to take out their pursuers with a huge gun, she turns out to be the better shot, but the reason is that she uses her head: He made the mistake of trying to fire the weapon unsupported, but she cleverly uses Max's shoulder as a tripod to stabilize it. The film doesn't pretend that Furiosa has the same muscle power as Max and the boys. But she is wily and resourceful.\\" Brent Walter Cline argues that an aspect of Furiosa's personality or characterization that is overlooked but just as important as her feminism is her disability: \\"That Furiosa should be the one to kill Immortan Joe is appropriate, given Miller's desire for a 'feminist action movie.' It's also appropriate, however, given what the film tells us about disability. The very manner of Immortan Joe's death is telling. Furiosa hooks her metal arm to his breathing mask, and then rids herself voluntarily of her prosthesis, tearing away not only Immortan Joe's mask but his face as well. For him, these things cannot be separated. Furiosa will reveal her impairment, but Immortan Joe can never, and its removal is both the metaphorical and literal end of his reign.\\" Reception Furiosa's character received universal critical acclaim. Furiosa has received praise for being a strong female action heroine and bringing feminist themes to the franchise. A.O. Scott and Manohla Dargis of the New York Times said that \\"Mad Max, which has garnered almost $150 million domestically so far, and near unanimous critical rapture, belongs less to its titular hero than to Imperator Furiosa, the steely avenger played by Charlize Theron. Her mission is to liberate the enslaved 'wives' of the arch-villain, and she receives crucial assistance from a band of gray-haired motorcycle matriarchs.\\" Richard Roeper wrote for The Chicago Sun Times that \\"Max often takes a passenger seat to Theron's Imperator Furiosa, this is one female- empowered action vehicle.\\" Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle wrote that \\"Furiosa, who more than lives up to her name, is Fury Roads heart and soul ‚Äì well, after all those nightmarishly souped-up deathmobiles ‚Äì and this future √ºber-feminist/humanist gets all of the good lines.\\" Ty Burr of The Boston Globe proclaimed, \\"About a half hour into Mad Max: Fury Road, you may realize with a start that Max is sharing hero duties with a fiery woman warrior named Furiosa, played with tensile strength by Charlize Theron, and that Furiosa may actually be the central figure in this breakneck and emotionally resonant film. Utterly capable while yearning for 'the green place' from which she was kidnapped as a child, outfitted with a spidery mechanical arm that is one of Miller's many nods to that classic movie dystopia 'Metropolis,' Furiosa is the movie's soul and spine.\\" Lou Lumenick of the New York Post stated of Theron's performance and the character of Furiosa: \\"this spectacularly great reboot is surprisingly owned not by Hardy, who is fine, but by Charlize Theron. I wouldn't be at all surprised if Theron collected her third Oscar nomination (she won Best Actress for Monster) for her dazzling work as Imperator Furiosa, a smart, fearsome, one-armed rogue soldier bent on smuggling five women to freedom inside a gasoline truck with Max's initially reluctant help.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said, \\"Hardy and Theron make a dynamite team, but this is Theron's show. She's a knockout in a sensational performance that blends grit and gravity and becomes the film's bruised heart and soul.\\" Lawrence Toppman of The Charlotte Observer agreed, saying that \\"Theron stands out\\" in her role. Claudia Puig of USA Today declared that Theron as Furiosa was \\"[t]he best female action hero since Sigourney Weaver in Alien\\", and added that the actress \\"is riveting as the clever and determined, shaved-headed Furiosa. She lends the role a fascinating blend of toughness, tenderness and gravitas as we learn her tragic back story in the film's final third.\\" References External links * Imperator Furiosa on IMDb Mad Max (franchise) characters Female characters in film Film characters introduced in 2015 Fictional amputees Fictional mechanics Fictional mercenaries Fictional survivalists Fictional truck drivers Fictional vigilantes Fictional women soldiers and warriors ","title":"Imperator Furiosa"},{"id":"47150966","text":"Johnson-Hubbard House is a historic home located at Wilkesboro, Wilkes County, North Carolina.

Since 2010, he has worked as a communications advisor at the United Nations around the world, including in Haiti, Switzerland, and Mali. Biography Dimitry Elias L√©ger was born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on Sept. 27, 1971. His childhood life alternated between New York City and Port-au-Prince until the age of 14, when he permanently moved to Brooklyn.

In L√©ger‚Äôs narrative landscape, Inferno, Purgatario, Paradiso are collapsed onto each other in a heap of dust and rubble. There‚Äôs room to regret past choices; there‚Äôs no clear route to paradise.

Origin 16 pdr RML Shropshire & Staffordshire Volunteer Artillery, 1897 The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many units composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need.Beckett. The 1st Staffordshire Artillery Volunteer Corps (AVC) was one such unit, formed at Etruria, Staffordshire, with the first officers' commissions being issued on 18 December 1860.Beckett, Appendix VIII.Litchfield & Westlake, p. 154. Initially, the 1st Staffordshire (along with the 1st Shropshire and 1st Worcestershire AVCs; there were no 2nd AVCs in any of these counties) formed part of the 1st Cheshire Administrative Brigade. In 1869 it became part of a new 1st Shropshire Administrative Brigade (again with the 1st Shropshire and 1st Worcestershire), with William Field of the 1st Shropshire as lieutenant- colonel in command.Monthly Army Lists. Later, the Worcester Volunteers left to join with the Warwickshires, and in 1880 the 1st Shropshire and Staffordshire Volunteer Artillery were consolidated into a single unit, with the Staffords providing Nos 5 to 8 Batteries. It was organised as a brigade of 'position artillery', equipped with 16 Pounder Rifled Muzzle Loading field guns, and was attached to the Southern Division of the Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA) and in 1902 was renamed the 1st Shropshire and Staffordshire RGA (Volunteers) with two companies. As late as 1906, they were still using the 16 Pounders in their annual camp at Bare, Morecambe.Derek Harrison, A History of the Shropshire Artillery Volunteer Corps, Spink & Son Ltd, 2015, p313 The brigade's headquarters was at Etruria, later moving to Shelton, Staffordshire.Harrison & Duckers.Shropshire RHA: Outline History.

Sir Smith Hill Child, 2nd Baronet, a local Staffordshire landowner and former officer in the Irish Guards, was appointed commanding officer in 1910.Burke First World War Mobilisation The order to mobilise was received on 4 August 1914. Shortly afterwards, the men were invited to volunteer for overseas service, and the majority having accepted this liability, the North Midland Division concentrated at Luton. In November, it moved to the area round Bishop's Stortford where it completed its war training. At the time of mobilisation, the three batteries of II North Midland Brigade were each equipped with four 15-pounder field guns. Meanwhile, the men who had not volunteered for foreign service, together with the recruits who were coming forward, remained at Stoke-on-Trent to form a 2nd Line unit designated the 2/II North Midland Brigade, after which the parent unit became the 1/II Brigade.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 17‚Äì23. 1/II North Midland Brigade The North Midland Division began embarking for France on 25 February 1915, and by 8 March had completed its concentration at Ploegsteert in Belgium ‚Äì the first complete TF division to deploy to the Western Front. It was numbered the 46th (North Midland) Division shortly afterwards.

The Germans recaptured the Hohenzollern trench system on 3 October, and the new attack was aimed at this point. The artillery bombardment (by the field guns of 46th and 28th Division, backed by heavy batteries) began at 12.00 on 13 October and the infantry went in at 14.00 behind a gas cloud. The attack was a disaster, most of the leading waves being cut down by machine gun and shell fire from German positions that had not been suppressed by the bombardment.Cherry, pp. 269‚Äì97.Rawson, pp. 120‚Äì8. On 23 December, the 46th (NM) Division was ordered to embark for Egypt. It entrained for Marseilles, and some of the infantry had actually reached Egypt before the order was rescinded on 21 January 1916. The artillery returned from Marseilles and the whole division reassembled on the Western Front near Amiens by 14 February. 46th Divisional Artillery rearmed with 18-pounder guns in November 1915. In April and May 1916 the BEF's artillery was reorganised: II North Midland Brigade became CCXXXI Bde RFA (231 Brigade), its batteries were lettered A‚ÄìC, and a new D Battery was formed. D Battery was almost immediately exchanged for D (Howitzer) Battery from CCXXXIII Brigade (formerly A Battery of CLIV (Empire) Brigade, a unit from Croydon attached to the New Army 36th (Ulster) Division) equipped with 4 x 4.5-inch howitzers. Lastly the Brigade Ammunition Columns were absorbed into the Divisional Ammunition Column.MacDonald, pp. 86, 108. =Gommecourt= On 1 May 1916, the division was ordered into the line facing Gommecourt in preparation for the forthcoming Somme Offensive. Over the first 10 days of the month, the divisional artillery took over the existing battery positions along this front and began digging additional ones. The sector was a quiet one, but on the night of 15/16 May there was a sudden German bombardment of the division's positions, apparently set off by the Germans detecting a wiring party of the adjacent 56t (1st London) Division working in No-Man's Land. CCXXXI's batteries returned the fire from their position behind Foncquevillers, and the exchange went on for about 50 minutes.MacDonald, pp. 69, 80, 89‚Äì90. Preparations were under way for the 46th and 56th Divisions' assault on Gommecourt on 1 July as a diversion from the main attack further south. While the heavy guns were moved up and dug in, CCXXXI's 18-pounders were used on 22 May to bombard a suspected German machine gun position.MacDonald, p. 107. On 18 June, the divisional artillery was allocated its tasks for wire-cutting and registration of targets ahead of the attack: CCXXXI and CCXXXII Brigades formed the Left group, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Hill Child of CCXXXI. This group supported the attack of 139 Brigade, which was made by two battalions (1/5th and 1/7th (Robin Hoods) Sherwood Foresters) over a frontage of 520 yards into an area of dead ground in front of Gommecourt Wood where the German wire entanglements could not been seen by artillery observers.MacDonald, pp. 165‚Äì8. Although CCXXXI Brigade thought that its wirecutting was successful, the results of this bombardment were patchy.MacDonald, pp. 214‚Äì5. The Germans reported that in this area their 'front trenches were levelled and the wire shot away' but their casualties had been few because of their deep dugouts, and when the attack went in on 1 July their men emerged to receive the attack with heavy machine-gun and rifle fire.Edmonds, 1916, pp. 474‚Äì5. During the attack, the 18-pounders fired a covering barrage, which was lifted onto each enemy trench line in turn, but the infantry were unable to keep up with these lifts: artillery observation during the attack was difficult due to the smokescreen and confusion.Edmonds, 1916, p. 461.MacDonald, pp. 455‚Äì57. 139 Brigade broke into the first German trench and some parties reached the second, but overall the attack was a bloody failure, as was the whole Gommecourt action.Edmonds, 1916, pp. 467‚Äì8.MacDonald, pp. 358‚Äì417.Anon, Robin Hoods, pp. 202‚Äì7. Attempts to reinforce 139 Brigade during the afternoon broke down and the Germans retook the positions lost.Edmonds, 1916, pp. 469‚Äì70.MacDonald, pp. 418‚Äì63. Although the 46th Division remained in the line in front of Gommecourt until March 1917 (apart from a month's rest in November), it did not attack again. On 28 August 1916, the brigade's former D Battery returned, and was broken up to bring B and C Batteries up to six guns each. Similarly, A Battery received a section from CCXXXII Brigade's D Battery. On 2 January 1917, C (H)/CCXXXII (former 512 (H) Battery) was broken up and a section joined D (H)/CCXXXI to bring it up to six 4.5-inch howitzers. For the remainder of the war, the brigade had the following organisation: * A/CCXXXI (1st Stafford Battery + half former D/CCXXXII) 6 x 18-pdrs * B/CCXXXI (2nd Stafford Battery + half former D Battery) 6 x 18-pdrs * C/CCXXXI (3rd Stafford Battery + half former D Battery) 6 x 18-pdrs * D (H)/CCXXXI (Empire Battery + half 512 Battery) 6 x 4.5-inch howitzers =Bucquoy= At the beginning of March 1917, patrols found that the Germans were beginning to retreat from the Gommecourt defences. The division followed up slowly and cautiously, but on the night of 14 March an attack on Bucquoy Graben (trench) by 137th (Staffordshire) Brigade led to heavy casualties. The rushed attack had been ordered by V Corps headquarters despite the protests of the divisional commander, and there was not time for the artillery adequately to cut the enemy wire. The attack went in behind an artillery barrage moving at 100 yards in four minutes but although 'the assault was gallantly pressed' (Official History) it was a complete failure.MacDonald, pp. 556‚Äì7.Campbell-Johnson, p. 9.Falls, pp. 108‚Äì9.Accounts of attack on Bucquoy at Buxton War Memorials The Germans eventually retreated as far as their new Hindenburg Line defences well beyond the Somme battlefields, but 46th Division was withdrawn from the pursuit on 17 March.MacDonald, pp. 559‚Äì6. =Lens= After rest and training, the 46th Division returned to the line in the coal-mining sector around Lens in April. In May and June, the division carried out small-scale operations against Hill 65.Campbell-Johnson, pp. 10‚Äì19. 46th Division was now ordered to capture Lens itself, beginning on 28 June. Another divisional attack on 1 July aimed at capturing more houses and trenches. 137 Brigade attacked 'Aconite' trench behind a creeping barrage beginning at 02.47. By 07.00, the two right companies held Aconite, but the two left companies were held up in severe house-to-house fighting. A second push at 08.00 cleared the cellars round the church and caused heavy casualties to the defenders. But, in the afternoon, a German counter-attacks drove the battalion back to its start line.Campbell- Johnson, pp. 19, 24‚Äì30. After Lens, the division was withdrawn into reserve, and did not engage in major operations again during 1917. On 13 March 1918 the brigadier-general, Royal Artillery, (BGRA) of 46th Division was wounded, and Hill Child took over in an acting capacity. On 22 March Hill Child was confirmed as BGRA, a position he held until the end of the war. =St Quentin Canal= The 46th Division had been very unlucky during the war, the infantry in particular taking appalling casualties at the Hohenzollern Redoubt and Gommecourt, but it gained revenge at the Battle of the St Quentin Canal on 29 September 1918 when it performed one of the great feats of the First World War by crossing the canal and breaking open the Hindenburg Line. Careful artillery preparation and support was an integral part of this success. Hill Child had nine brigades of field artillery under his command, including CCXXXI Brigade, and several brigades of corps heavy artillery were also firing on the division's front. The bombardment began on the night of 26/27 September with harassing fire and gas shells, followed with intense bombardment with high explosive shells until the morning of the assault.Priestley, pp. 39‚Äì41.Farndale, pp. 298‚Äì9.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, p. 103. Every field gun was used in carefully timed barrages: 'creeping barrages' (including smoke shells) ahead of the attacking troops, with pauses at the end of each phase, including a 'standing barrage' of three hours to allow mopping-up of the first objectives to be carried out, and the second wave of troops to pass through and renew the attack behind the creeping barrage.Priestley, pp. 41, 46‚Äì50. The first of these creeping barrages actually progressed at twice the normal pace while the infantry rushed downhill to seize the canal crossings; it was described in the Official History as 'one of the finest ever seen'. The attack was a brilliant success, and by the afternoon the field artillery batteries were crossing the canal by the bridges that had been captured or thrown across, and were coming into action on the far side.Priestley, p. 73. Over succeeding weeks, the division took part in a succession of successive follow- up attacks: Battle of the Beaurevoir Line, Battle of Cambrai (1918), Battle of the Selle and Battle of the Sambre (1918). On 8 November 1918, in its last operation of the war, 46th Division pushed forward 138 Brigade to seize the Avesnes road, aided by concentrations of fire from CCXXXI Brigade on the main points of resistance.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 519‚Äì20. CCXXXI Brigade was placed in suspended animation in 1919. 2/II North Midland Bde Meanwhile, the men who had not volunteered for foreign service, together with the recruits who were coming forward, remained to form the 2/I North Midland Brigade, RFA, in the 2nd North Midland Division (59th (2nd North Midland) Division from August 1915), which concentrated round Luton in January 1915.59th (2nd NM) Division at Long, Long Trail. At first, the 2nd Line recruits had to parade in civilian clothes and train with 'Quaker' guns ‚Äì logs of wood mounted on cart wheels ‚Äì but these shortages were slowly made up. Uniforms arrived in November 1914, but it was not until March 1915 that a few 90 mm French guns arrived for training. The division took over the requisitioned transport and second-hand horse harness when 46th Division was re-equipped and left for France. The divisional artillery were joined at Luton by the1st Line 4th Home Counties (Howitzer) Brigade, RFA, and Wessex Heavy Bty, RGA, which were fully equipped and could lend guns for training. Later, the 59th Divisional Artillery took over some 15-pounders (without sights) from a TF division that was proceeding to India. In July, the division moved out of overcrowded Luton, the artillery moving to Hemel Hempstead, where they spent the winter of 1915‚Äì16. In early 1916 the batteries were finally brought up to establishment in horses, and 18-pounders replaced the 15-pounders.Bradbridge, pp. 8, 86‚Äì9, 115‚Äì7. After the Easter Rising in April, the division was sent to Ireland. Once the trouble in Dublin had been suppressed, the troops moved out to The Curragh to continue training. In April 1916, the batteries were designated A, B and C, and later the brigade was numbered CCXCVI (296). At the end of May, 2/1st Essex Royal Horse Artillery joined the brigade as D Battery, but was exchanged in July for B (Howitzer) Battery of CCXCVIII (2/IV North Midland) Brigade. This battery, originally designated 2/2nd Derbyshire Howitzer Battery, was equipped with 4.5-inch howitzers and became D (H) Battery. In January 1917, the 59th Division was relieved in Ireland and returned to the United Kingdom, concentrating at the Fovant training area on the edge of Salisbury Plain preparatory to embarking for France. Before departure, the artillery underwent a further reorganisation, with A, B and C Batteries of CCXCVI each receiving a section from A, B and C Batteries of CCXCVII (formerly 2/III North Midland) Brigade, bringing them up to a strength of six guns each. In France, D (H) Battery was similarly made up with a section from C (H)/CCXCVIII (formerly 3 (H)/LIX in 11th (Northern) Division). The final organisation of the brigade was therefore as follows: * A/CCXCVI (2/1st Stafford Bty + half former 2/4th Stafford Battery) 6 x 18-pdrs * B/CCXCVI (2/2nd Stafford Bty + half former 2/5th Stafford Battery) 6 x 18-pdrs * C/CCXCVI (2/3rd Stafford Bty + half former 2/6th Stafford Battery) 6 x 18-pdrs * D (H)/CCXCVI (2/2nd Derbyshire (H) Battery + half former 3 (H)/LIX) 6 x 4.5-inch howitzers 59th Division began crossing to France on 17 February 1917 and completed its concentration around Mericourt by 3 March. =3rd Ypres= The 59th Division took part in following the German Army's retreat to the Hindenburg Line in March and April, but it was not until September that it was engaged in its first full-scale action, the phase of the 3rd Ypres Offensive known as the Battle of the Menin Road Ridge. This was a carefully prepared assault with massive artillery preparation, and most of the objectives were taken easily.Wolff, pp. 191‚Äì5. The next phase, the Battle of Polygon Wood (26 September), was equally successful, with 176th Brigade advancing steadily behind its barrage onto the final objectives.Edmonds, 1917, pp. 288‚Äì9.Wolff, p. 199. =Bourlon Wood= 59th Division was next moved south to join in the Battle of Cambrai. The division entered the recently captured line between Cantaing and Bourlon Wood on 28 November. Fierce German counter-attacks began on 30 November. Two infantry assaults were made against 176th Brigade, but both attacks were easily broken up under British artillery fire.Miles, pp. 167, 213.Farndale, p. 255. By 4 December the decision had been made to withdraw from the Bourlon Salient, and 59th Division held covering positions while this was carried out. On 7 December the British were back on the line that they would hold for the coming winter.Miles, pp. 226, 262‚Äì7. =Spring Offensive= When the German Spring Offensive began on 21 March 1918 (the Battle of St Quentin), 59th Division was holding the Bullecourt Salient, squarely in the path of the German thrust. The situation soon became desperate, the forward brigades were almost totally destroyed, and the reserves moving up were swamped. The division's field guns in the forward zone were captured after firing over open sights at the advancing Germans. The line was held by rear details, including the gunners using rifles and Lewis guns. Only two batteries of 59th Divisional Artillery escaped, remaining in action for the next four days under the command of 40th Division, during the rest of the Battle of St Quentin and the Battle of Bapaume.Blaxland, p. 48.Middlebrook, pp. 192‚Äì3, 232‚Äì4, 254‚Äì5, 270.Farndale, p. 265. While 59th Division was withdrawn, its artillery remained in the front line, under the command of 42nd (East Lancashire) Division, with which it fought at the Battles of Arras (28 March) and the Ancre (5 April). =Reconstruction= 59th Division, without its artillery, was back in the line on 14 April, when it was again in the path of a German offensive (the Battle of Bailleul) and remnants took part in the 1st Battle of Kemmel Ridge (17‚Äì18 April). By now, 59th Division's infantry had been almost destroyed. The units were reduced to training cadres and the division was later reconstructed with garrison battalions. Until June, it was employed in digging rear defences, then it underwent training to enable it to hold a sector of the front line. On 25 July the reconstructed division went back into the line, and on 21 August it once more took part in active operations. However, the Divisional Artillery (CCXCV and CCXCVI Brigades) remained in the Line, serving with various formations as required: 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division (15‚Äì24 April and 17 May‚Äì19 June), 37th Division (24 April‚Äì17 May), XVIII Corps (23 June‚Äì1 July), 5th Division (1‚Äì8 August) and 61st (2nd South Midland) Division (8‚Äì26 August). =Advance to Victory= The 59th Divisional Artillery rejoined its parent division on 27 August 1918. From 2 October until 11 November 1918, the division participated in the final advance in Artois and Flanders. On 2 October, 59th Division ordered two minor operations in which detachments advanced under cover of smoke and a creeping barrage; these determined that the enemy had retired, and so the division advanced against little opposition.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 126‚Äì7. On 16 October the division fought its way through the old defences of Lille, and liberated the city against minimal opposition the following day.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 408‚Äì13. Opposition stiffened at the River Schelde was approached, but this was crossed in early November.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 419‚Äì23, 543‚Äì5. The Armistice on 11 November found the division astride the Schelde north of Tournai. It moved to the coast to operate demobilisation centres at Dieppe, Dunkirk and Calais in early 1919, and to train drafts for continued service in Egypt and the Black Sea. 59th Divisional Artillery including CCXCVI Brigade, was demobilised on 8 August 1919. Interwar The 2nd North Midland Bde RFA was reformed in 1920 with an additional battery (based at Stafford) from the former 3rd North Midland. On the reconstitution of the TF as the Territorial Army (TA), the 2nd was renumbered as 61st (North Midland) Bde RFA in 1921 (becoming a 'Field Brigade, RA' in 1924 when the RFA merged into the rest of the Royal Artillery). The unit had the following composition:Titles & designations. * HQ at Drill Hall, Victoria Square, Shelton * 241st (North Stafford) Field Bty at Drill Hall, Victoria Square, Shelton * 242nd (North Stafford) Field Bty at Drill Hall, Victoria Square, Shelton * 243rd (Leek) Field Bty (Howitzers) at Drill Hall, Leek * 244th (Stafford) Field Bty at Drill Hall, Bailley Street, Stafford In December 1936, the 46th (North Midland) Division was disbanded, and its headquarters was reconstituted as 2nd Anti-Aircraft Division. 61st Field Regiment (as field brigades were redesignated from 1938) was then attached to 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division. When the TA was doubled in size after the Munich Agreement, the regiment split into two: * 61st (North Midland) Field Regiment with 241 & 242 (North Staffordshire) Batteries, based at Shelton.61 Fd Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45 * 116th Field Regiment with 243 (Leek) & 244 (Stafford) Batteries, based at Hanley (the title 'North Midland' was added in 1942).116 Fd Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45 Second World War 61st and 116th (North Midland) Field Regiments On the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, both regiments were in the process of transferring to the new 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division being formed as a 2nd Line duplicate by 55th Division.Western Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot FilesJoslen, p. 93. The division served in various parts of the United Kingdom for the first part of the war, including a spell in Northern Ireland (June 1942 to March 1943).http://59div.morssweb.com/?itin Latterly it was training for Operation Overlord. It embarked on 21 June 1944 and landed in Normandy on 27 June (D + 21). =Normandy= On 8 July, 59th Division took part in a large-scale attack on Caen, Operation Charnwood, with the artillery of the attacking divisions greatly reinforced by Army Groups Royal Artillery (AGRAs), guns of the Royal Navy and heavy bombers of the Royal Air Force. The attack on the division's front was only partially successful, but after clearing up pockets of resistance it reached its objectives the next day.Ellis, Normandy, pp. 311‚Äì6. 59th division was then moved west of Caen and attacked again, on 15‚Äì18 July, as part of the holding operation before Operation Goodwood was launched to the east.Ellis, Normandy, p. 334. On 6 August, the division's infantry forded the River Orne and then held off heavy counter-attacks, while its artillery supported it from across the river until bridges could be built.Ellis, Normandy, p. 408. By 18 August, the division was pushing south as part of the northern pincer closing the Falaise Pocket.Ellis, Normandy, p. 445. At the end of August, the 59th Division was broken up to provide drafts for other formations, due to a severe shortage of manpower in the British Army at the time. However, the divisional field artillery was kept together as 59th Army Group Royal Artillery, serving directly under Corps and Army HQs as required, until the end of the year.Ellis, Normandy, p. 453.Joslen, p. 463. The composition of AGRAs varied according to circumstances, and mainly comprised medium regiments, but 61st Field Regiment was usually included in 59th AGRA during the autumn of 1944, sometimes with 116th Field Regiment in addition.59 AGRA War Diary, August‚ÄìDecember 1944, The National Archives (TNA), Kew file WO 171/912. =Netherlands= In early October, 59th AGRA moved up to 'The Island', near Nijmegen, supporting first the US 101st Airborne Division, then the 2nd and 3rd Canadian Divisions in the Hoogboom area. 61 and 116 Field Regiments were absent from 59 AGRA in late October, then for most of November 59th AGRA only had 61st Field Rgt and one other under command, and was not given any targets until 28‚Äì29 November when it fired in support of 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division's operation to clear Blerick (Operation Guildford).Martin, p. 215. At the end of November, it was announced that 59th AGRA was to be disbanded to provide drafts for the infantry. 59th AGRA's guns continued to fire in support of Operation Guildford, then, on 4 December, the formation moved to the Svegehem area, where 61st Field Rgt left. The disbandment of 59th AGRA's remaining units began in December, with the first drafts of gunners transferring to the infantry in the United Kingdom. 116 Field Regiment was one of those placed in suspended animation from January 1945. 61st Super Heavy Regiment 61st Field Regiment escaped disbandment and was given a new role as a 'Super Heavy' regiment, equipped with US-built 240 mm howitzers and 8-inch guns. It operated these guns supporting 21st Army Group until the end of the war; it was placed in suspended animation in 1946.British Artillery of World War 2Ellis, Germany, Appendix IV, p. 384. Postwar When the Territorial Army was reformed in 1947, the 61st Field Regiment was reconstituted as 261 Observation Rgt RA (North Midland) at Stoke, forming part of 88 (Field) AGRA. It was renamed 261 (North Midland) Locating Regt in 1951.235‚Äì265 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 onLitchfield, Appendix 5. 88 AGRA was disbanded on 31 October 1956 and 261 Rgt was reduced to battery strength as 887 Locating Battery. The battery HQ was at Hanley until 1961, when it moved to Newcastle-under-Lyme. In 1967, the unit was transferred to the Royal Armoured Corps as B (887 Locating Bty) Squadron of the Staffordshire Yeomanry (Queen's Own Royal Regiment), at Stafford; the squadron also included part of 125 Engineer Regiment Royal Engineers (originally North Midland Divisional RE). In 1969, the Staffordshire Yeomanry was reduced to a cadre, and when it was reformed two years later it was as a squadron of the Queen's Own Mercian Yeomanry and the artillery lineage disappeared.Staffordshire Yeomanry at Regiments.org118‚Äì432 Rgts RE at British Army 1945 on Honorary colonels * William S.

A scroll above the gun read FIRST, and the scroll beneath read STAFFORDSHIRE ARTILLERY VOLUNTEERS. After the TF was formed, the other ranks of the Staffordshire Batteries wore brass shoulder titles with the lettering T above RFA above STAFFORD, while the Brigade Ammunition Column wore T above RFA above NORTH MIDLAND. Memorials There are two memorials to the 46th (North Midland) Division on the battlefield of the Hohenzollern Redoubt: one on the road between Vermelles and Hulluch, marking the jumping-off point of the attack, and one on the site of the redoubt itself, which lists all the units of the division.

Nicolas (1832, p.243) stated his arms as Ermine, three chevrons gules Sir John Sully (born c.1283 - died c.1388), KG, of Ruxford and Iddesleigh in Devonshire, was an English knight. He was one of the many deponents who gave evidence in Scrope v Grosvenor (decided in 1389), one of the earliest heraldic law cases brought in England, at which time he stated his age as 105. In about 1362, he was appointed by King Edward III as the 39th Knight of the Garter. Origins According to Nicolas (1832), he descended from a younger branch of the family of Sully, lords of the manor of Iddesleigh in Devonshire, and appears to have succeeded to that property as heir male. According to Pole, he possessed Iddesleigh in 1356.Pole, p.380, Edeslegh (regnal date 29 Edward III); Nicolas, p.241, note 1 According to Nicholas: \\"Nothing can with certainty be said of his parents, nor is it positively known whether he left descendants\\". He may have been a descendant of Reymode de Sully, the son of Walter de Sully, who in 1291 held a fifth moiety of the feudal barony of Great Torrington in Devon, on which he paid feudal relief of ¬£20 to the king, presumably having just then inherited it from his father. The moiety had been first acquired by his ancestor de Sully who had married one of the five sisters and co-heiresses of Matthew de Torrington, feudal baron of Great Torrington.Pole, pp.20-1; co-heiresses of the barony were Matthew's sisters, not daughters as stated by Pole On failure of the male line, this de Sully moiety passed to the de Brian family, by the marriage during the reign of King Henry III (1216-1272) of Guy de Brian to the heiress Sibil de Sully (sister of Raymond de Sully and daughter of Walter de Sully).Pole, p.274 The eventual co-heir to Guy de Brian was Sir John Cary (d.1395) of Cockington, Devon. He may also have been descended from the 11th century knight Sir Reginald (or RaymondPole, p.83) de Sully, one of the Twelve Knights of Glamorgan, the legendary followers of Robert FitzHamon (d.1107), the Norman conqueror of Glamorgan. He was given as his share of the conquered lands the lordship of Sully, where he built his castle. Risdon apparently confused himRisdon, p.261 with \\"John de Sudeley\\", who in 1301 sealed the Barons' Letter to the Pope with a seal inscribed S(igillum) Johannis de Suleye (\\"seal of John de Suleye\\") and bearing arms of two bendlets,See image of seal at :Sullee and who in the document is called Joh(ann)es D(omi)n(u)s de Sullee (\\"John, lord of Sullee\\"), which place Lord Howard de Walden (1903) identified as Sudeley Castle in Gloucestershire.Lord Howard de Walden, Some Feudal Lords and their Seals 1301, published 1903 Armorials His Garter stall plate does not survive but was recorded by the antiquarian Ashmole (d.1692)Ashmole MS Collections for the Order of the Garter, Ashmolean Museum. Ashmole incorrectly recorded the name on the plate as John \\"Sulby\\" (Nicolas, 1832, p.243) as showing arms of Ermine, four barrulets gules with crest Two bull's horns.Nicolas, 1832, p.243, footnote 2; Beltz, George Frederick, Memorials of the Order of the Garter from Its Foundation to the Present Time, London: William Pickering, 1841 His family's arms are however given differently by the Devon historian Sir William Pole (d.1635) as Ermine, three chevrons gulesPole, Sir William (d.1635), Collections Towards a Description of the County of Devon, Sir John-William de la Pole (ed.), London, 1791, p.501, also a version with field argent, with various heraldic differences. Nicolas (1832, p.243) stated his arms as Ermine, three chevrons gules Career It appears that he passed the greater part of his life in the field, and that he was the \\"hero of a hundred battles.\\" He was at the Battle of Halidon Hill in Scotland, and at the taking of Berwick in July 1333. On 12 July 1338, he was in France, in the retinue of the Earl of Salisbury and was present at the Battle of Cr√©cy in August 1346. On 29 August 1350, he was at the naval battle under King Edward III in person, when a complete victory was gained over the Spanish fleet, thence called the Battle of Les Espagnols sur Mer (modern: Battle of Winchelsea). Sully was in Gascony with the Black Prince in 1355 and 1356, and a payment was made to him at Bordeaux on 1 October 1355 by the hands of Richard Baker his esquire.' On 17 September 1356, he shared in the honours of the Battle of Poitiers and letters of protection were granted to him in 1359, when he was in the army in Gascony. In 1361, he obtained the following singular grant from the King: \\"That he might once in every year during his life, in any of the royal forests, parks, or chases in the realm, have one shot with his bow, one course with his hounds, and one chase for his dog called Bercelette\\". The merits of Sir John Sully were about this time rewarded in the most striking manner. On the feast of St. George 1362 he was elected into the Order of the Garter, in the ninth stall on the Prince's side, in lieu of Sir Reginald Cobham; and the Garter stall plate of his arms was still remaining in the reign of Charles II. In 1362, he was a mainpernor for John de Saint Low the son, and Matthew de Goumay, then prisoners in the Tower of London. Sully again accompanied the Black Prince to Gascony in 1365, and in April 1367 was at the Battle of N√°jera. Three years afterwards, in 1370, he again received letters of protection, being about to serve in Acquitaine and as he was then nearly ninety years old, it is not surprising that his name does not afterwards occur in public records until his appearance as a witness in favour of Sir Richard Scrope. He seems to have then retired from public life, attended by Richard Baker his faithful esquire, who, having partaken of his master's toils and dangers, became the companion of his latter years. Crusader The following anecdote of a Sir John Sully is related by Pole:Pole, p.83, \\"Men of best note and which have either in war or peace been employed in this county\\" (i.e. Devon) :\\"Sir John Sully, renowned for his exploits in the Holy Land against the Saracens, in which he was weakened by many wounds, returned home after many years' discontinuance, whereupon his officers bringing in the accounts of his rent, which amounted to a great mass of money, he caused his cloak, being of cloth of gold, to be spread on the ground, and commanding the money to be put therein, cast himself thereinto, that it might be said for once he tumbled in gold and silver; whereof he afterwards gave one part to his wife, a second to his officers and tenants, a third part to the poor\\". His action was deemed by the Duchess of Cleveland (1889) \\"a childish excursion into Tom Tidler's Ground.\\" Deponent at Scrope v Grosvenor Due to his very old age of 105, and his inability to travel to the court of the Earl Marshal, an officer of the court was sent to his house at Iddesleigh to record his deposition, which he gave in favour of Sir Richard Scrope in the famous case of Scrope v Grosvenor, decided in 1389, in which he stated he saw Scrope bear the arms which formed the subject of the case. Sir John Sully, of the age of one hundred and five year, and armed eighty years, deposed that he had seen and known the arms of Sir Richard Scrope, borne by Sir Henry Scrope, at the battle of Halidon Hill, blazoned: \\"the field azure, a bend or, with a label argent\\". He afterwards saw the said Sir Henry armed in the same arms at the Siege of Berwick; Sir William Scrope at the battle of Cressy so armed with a difference; the said Sir Richard armed in the same arms at the Battle of Espagnols-sur-mere; and afterwards saw the said Sir William Scrope armed in the same arms with the Black Prince at the battle of Poictiers, and the said Sir Richard so armed at the battle of Spain, [Najara.] Sully said he had also seen and known others of the name and lineage armed in the same arms in journeys and expeditions, with differences; and in his time he had always heard that the said arms belonged to Sir Richard Scrope by descent, who, with others of his lineage, had peaceably enjoyed them from beyond the time of memory. As to Sir Robert Grosvenor, he never saw or heard of him or of his ancestors, until the time of his examination. Landholdings *Ruxford. Sir John Sully's chief residence appears to have been Ruxford, in the parish of Sandford, about 1/2 mile north-west of Crediton in Devon, which he held from the de Raleigh family of Raleigh, Pilton in North Devon, ancestor of the Chichester baronets. Effigies of Sir John Sully and his wife Isobel exist in Crediton Parish Church. Sully was said by the Devon historian Westcote (d.circa 1637) to have had his seat at \\"Rookesford, lately the land of Chichester and alienated to Davye\\". He held Rokysforde from John de Raleigh as overlord as is evidenced in the latter's deed of 1362 now held in the North Devon Record Office.See:\\"File:JohnDeRaleighDeed1362.JPG\\": Archives of the Chichester family of Arlington Court, North Devon Record Office: PILTON, ARLINGTON, LOXHORE, CHALLACOMBE, SANDFORD?, WEST DOWN, all in Devon BAGGEARN HUISH, DUNWEAR, in Somerset 50/11/1/1 31 January 1362 36 Edward III *Iddesleigh. Presumably Sully also resided at the manor house of Iddesleigh, his family's ancient principal seat. He is said by the Duchess of Cleveland (1889) to have given Iddesleigh to his cousin Lord Martyn,Duchess of Cleveland, Battle Abbey Roll whose family were feudal barons of Barnstaple in North Devon. Death & succession Sully probably died in about 1388 as he is not mentioned in the records of the Order of the Garter after that year,Nicolas, 1832 at above the age of 105. The Devon historian Risdon (d.1640) states that he was buried in Crediton Church, a large and important collegiate church near his seat of Ruxford, having \\"died of the wounds received in the Holy War\\",Risdon, Tristram (d.1640), Survey of Devon, 1811 edition, London, 1811, with 1810 Additions, p.262 which wounds however apparently allowed him to live on to a great age. Regarding any progeny, Nicholas (1832) stated: \\"Nothing can with certainty be said of his parents, nor is it positively known whether he left descendants\\". The Westcountry historian Polwhele (d.1838) states however that the last male of the de Sully family left an only daughter who married Vowel, a Somersetshire knight, from whom the Smith family inherited a moiety of the manor of Iddesleigh.As quoted by Nicolas Chantry A chantry in Crediton Church was established by nine men resident near Crediton which provided an endowment to the Canons of Crediton to find a priest to sing daily mass for Sully‚Äôs soul. One of these contributors was recorded in 1408 as Richard Dowrich of Dowrich, near Ruxford.Maddock, Michael P.

One in the parish church of Iddesleigh in the form of a crossed-legged knight, traditionally the appropriate form for a crusader, situated in a low arched recess in the north chancel chapel.Risdon, p.262, regarding Iddesleigh: \\"This Sir John Sully...hath here a cenotaph and that after a martial manner with his proportion cross-legged cut thereon\\"; Pevsner, Nikolaus & Cherry, Bridget, The Buildings of England: Devon, London, 2004, p.499, who does not identify the person represented The other, next to the effigy of his wife, is in Crediton Parish Church on a chest tomb ,Pevsner, p.297 in the east chapel of the south aisle.

It refers to a hypothetical situation in which several individuals stage a contest for which one eventually emerges victorious. Contest competition has been demonstrated in controlled laboratory experiments among parasitic wasps.Wai, K. M., & Fujii, K. (1990). ‚ÄúIntraspecific larval competition among wasps parasitic of bean weevil larvae‚Äù. http://meme.biology.tohoku.ac.jp/popecol/RP%20PDF/32(1)/pp.85.pdf. Researches on population ecology, 32: 85-98. Contest competition is the opposite of scramble competition, a situation in which available resources are shared equally among individuals. As contest competition allows the monopolization of resources, offspring will typically always be produced and survive until adulthood independent of the population size. This results in stable population dynamics, in stark contrast to scramble competition which can result in periodic or chaotic population dynamics. The Beverton-Holt model is often used to represent population dynamics arising from contest competition. This model, and a few other well-known population models, can be explicitly derived from individual-level processes assuming contest competition and a random distribution of individuals among resources.Br√§nnstr√∂m, A., and Sumpter DJT (2005). ‚ÄúThe role of competition and clustering in population dynamics‚Äù. http://www.math.uu.se/~david/web/BrannstromSumpter05a.pdf.

It is part of the European Union-wide Natura 2000 network. Geography The waterfall is located in the village of Boda, 20 kilometres to the north of R√§ttvik. It lies at the eastern edge of the Siljan Ring, a prehistoric impact crater which was formed 377 million years ago during the Devonian period when a meteorite struck the Earth's surface. The bolide was estimated to be about 4 kilometres in diameter and was travelling at around 100,000 kilometres per hour, causing a vertical realignment of the horizontal rock strata and a depression of the bedrock upon collision. This had a profound effect upon the local environment, creating many of the geological features which exist to this day such as Lake Siljan to the south-west and Styggforsen. The river Styggfors√•n is interrupted by the waterfall which is 36 meters high and composed of a column of Ordovician limestone. The base of the waterfall abuts a dike of brecciated quartz which is believed to predate the impact event. The site is popular with tourists and it is encompassed by a circular path of about one kilometre that leads down to a cave called Troll Hole. A cafe is open during the summer time and there is also an information centre nearby. Flora and fauna In 1979, a nature reserve approximately 12 hectares in size was established around the waterfall, and in 2005 it was incorporated into the Natura 2000 network. Its moist climate is favoured by many lichens, mosses and plants, such as the rare orchid Epipactis atrorubens which grows there. It also provides a habitat for many species of insects which include Venusia cambrica, Hyloicus pinastri and Epirrhoe alternata. Picking flowers and doing anything to affect the environment is forbidden within the confines of the nature reserve.

They include besides her, her son, her nurse, her nurse's discontented lover, and a new lodger. Reception Almanac of Fall continues to receive positive reviews from critics, mainly for its cinematography. Rotten Tomatoes reports 100% approval among six critics, with an average rating of 8.1/10. Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader lauded the film's \\"elaborately choreographed mise en scene\\" and \\"highly unorthodox angles,\\" while a review in Strictly Film School argues, \\"Tarr [...] uses highly stylized, artificially colored lighting, rigorous (and deliberate) formalism, minimalist setting, and protracted dialogue to create an atmospherically charged and disquieting environment.\\" Almanac of Fall has since come to be regarded as a decisive moment in Tarr's filmography, in which he abandoned the documentary-like realism of his early work and adopted a formal style of cinematography. \\"This is the turning point for B√©la Tarr, leaving social realism behind to step into the existential abyss,\\" wrote Jeremiah Kipp reviewing the film for Slant magazine. Jeremy Heilman of Movie Martyr called it \\"Tarr's first feature that could be described as the work of a formalist\\" and noted retrospectively that the film \\"offers a first sign of the hint of supernatural control that would continue to crop up in each of Tarr's subsequent features.\\" Cast *H√©di Temessy as H√©di *Erika Bodn√°r as Anna *Mikl√≥s B.

It is located in 86 St James's Street in the central London district of St James's, opposite St James's Palace. While Freemasons' Hall is the headquarters of the United Grand Lodge of England and the Supreme Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons of England, Mark Masons' Hall is the home of several other important appendant orders of Freemasonry in England and Wales. History Earlier buildings The site of 86 St James's Street has been used for public houses and private clubs since the early 18th century. In 1702, the building was home to Williams' Coffee-House, a popular venue for the literati of the day. In 1749 the premises became a tavern. Following several other landlords, Richard John Atwood took on the lease in 1774 and ran the premises as a coffee house and a club. In 1772 he established a club called Atwood's which counted the historian and freemason Edward Gibbon among its members. In 1785 the house caught fire and was destroyed, but was rebuilt the following year. By 1801 the house at 86 St James's Street had become a public house, and was advertised as a place \\"where gentlemen meet on purpose to play at Billiards\\". After 1817 the Union Club was based here until the pub closed down in 1820, when the premises were taken over by Carey‚Äôs, the map makers. In February 1862 the building was demolished following a successful application to the Commissioners of Woods and Forests to erect a new building for a club House and chambers.Harry Wells, \\"Mark Masons' Hall, 86 St. James‚Äôs Street: A brief history of the present building\\", 28 May 2015 (online) , access date 4 July 2015 Current building The present building at 86 St James's Street was built between 1862 and 1865 following a design by Sir James Thomas Knowles (1831-1908). From 1866 to 1869 it was occupied by the Civil Service Club with residential apartments on the upper floors. In 1870 the Thatched House Club became the occupiers of the premises and remained here until 1949. In 1950 the lease of 86 St James's Street was taken over by the Union Club, previously housed at 10 Carlton House Terrace which had been taken over for government use. In 1964, the Constitutional Club took over the lease and carried out extensive refurbishment. On 3 December 1977, The Grand Lodge of Mark Master Masons of England and Wales obtained a lease for a term of 99 years. The conversion works began on 18 February 1978 and were completed by July 1979. Mark Masons‚Äô Hall was formally opened on 1 September 1979. Description 86 St James's Street is a Crown property and Grade II listed. At the time of its construction between 1862 and 1865, the building was described as \\"High Victorian\\". The property consists of seven levels which includes the lower ground floor and basement. On the ground floor it consists of four bays which are all arched. The right hand bay at the top of a flight of stone steps provides the main double doorway entrance. The windows on the first and third floors are arched including the four stone dormer windows on the top floor. Above the steeply pitched slate roof at each side stand two tall rustic banded chimney stacks. The main entrance leads to a panelled entrance hall and a free standing staircase, constructed from stone steps with an open well and cast iron ornamental balustrade. There are three large rooms on the ground floor, two of which are used as Masonic temples and the other a Board Room. On the first floor there is a front dining room which overlooks St James's Street as well as St James's Palace. The rear areas on this floor are used for dining and day time meetings. On the second floor, there is a licensed bar at the front. The rear areas on this floor house two more Masonic temples. The third floor houses three dining rooms and two further Masonic temples. The fourth floor is occupied by offices. The seven Masonic temples were all dedicated on 30 September 1980 and are named Grand Temple, Brazil, Bristol, Hong Kong, River Plate, Warwickshire and Johann Gutenberg. Headquarters The structure of Masonic appendant bodies in England and Wales. A majority of the appendent Masonic bodies have their headquarters at Mark Masons' Hall. The following appendant orders of Freemasonry in England and Wales have their headquarters at Mark Masons' Hall:http://www.glmmm.com/default.aspx * Order of Mark Master Masons * Ancient and Honourable Fraternity of Royal Ark Mariner * Knights Templar and Knights of Malta * Red Cross of Constantine * Order of Royal and Select Masters * Allied Masonic Degrees * Order of the Secret Monitor * Order of the Scarlet Cord * Rectified Scottish Rite Mark Masons' Hall also administers the Royal Order of Scotland for London, although not for Provinces elsewhere in England and Wales. In addition, there are two Order of Knight Masons councils meeting in the building, although all administration for the Order is carried out in Dublin, however, during 2016 a province for England and Wales was created, so the administration will be dealt with in the UK. There is also an unofficial connection with Ye Antient Order of Noble Corks, an informal \\"fun\\" degree dedicated to charitable fund raising, which was once strongly associated with Mark Masonry as the members of the Great Board of Corks traditionally used to be senior Mark Master Masons.

The most notable thing about this album is that Rocky Gray is no longer playing guitar, but is instead behind the drums. Cody Smith is now handling the guitar duties. This works great, and the album has some amazing riffs, which are what make it work.

Future Gator teammate Rex Farrior also attended. As an end on the football team, Ramsdell dropped a pass to tie the state championship game. The basketball team however did win a state title. Ramsdell is in the school's hall of fame. University of Florida Ramsdell attended the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he played several sports for the Florida Gators. Ramsdell was the starting quarterback for two seasons on the football team, a centerfielder on the baseball team, and a member of Florida's first basketball squad. Ramsdell began his collegiate athletic career on Florida's freshman football team, when he was taught the quarterback position by coach and former Gator quarterback Bob Shackleford. Then he played for coaches George E. Pyle and C. J. McCoy on the varsity Florida Gators football team from 1913 to 1915. The highlight of his football career was a 60-yard touchdown run in the rain to defeat Tulane in 1915. Ramsdell also scored four touchdowns in the game with Mercer that year. While running the bases during a baseball game against Auburn in 1915, Ramsdell accidentally stepped on the foot of first baseman George Steed and got his spikes caught in Steed's laces, which resulted in Ramsdell breaking his left leg with \\"a loud cracking noise\\". The serious injury ended Ramsdell's collegiate athletic career. Without their projected starting quarterback, the Gator football team went 0-5 and did not score a touchdown during the subsequent 1916 season.  Later life  Ramsdell married Geneva E.

The Bimoba speak the Moar. Origin The Bimoba are believed to have migrated southwards from the Present-day Burkina-Faso following the collapse of the Kingdom of Fada-Gurma around 1420. Society Bimoba society is patriarchal and is structured around clan and family heads. There are Clan-based kings or chiefs with vested power to hold the various clans together. The clans themselves can be located on multiple locations based on power and numbers. Presently, the clan groups of the Bimoba include Luok, Gnadaung, Dikperu, Puri, Tanmung, Gbong, Labsiak, Kunduek, Buok, the Baakpang, Turinwe and Kanyakib. Religion The Bimoba practice predominantly ethnic religions. Although they believe in the concept of an Almighty God, they each identify with personal deities collectively referred to as Yennu which translates as \\"god\\" or \\"sun\\". Their ancestors play a role by being the contact between themselves and Yannu. A typical Bimoba compound would have a clay construction altar (patir; plural: pataa) in an enclosed hut (nakouk) where sacrifices are made to invoke the presence of the ancestors. Women are allowed into the nakuuk. Aside the patir located in the compound, every family member is allowed to construct their own small altar known as a mier.

Trained in the United Kingdom, he showed good form as a two-year-old in 2002, winning two of his six races including the Mill Reef Stakes and finishing second in the Prix Morny. In the following year he finished second in the 2000 Guineas, won the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot and was rated the best three-year-old over one mile in Europe and North America. He was retired to stud at the end of the year and had moderate success as a sire of winners. Background Zafeen is a \\"huge\\" bay horse standing more than 16.2 hands high, with a white coronet on his right hind foot, bred in France by Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum's Gainsborough Stud. He was sired by Zafonic, the best European two-year-old of 1992 who went on to win the 2000 Guineas in the following year. The best of Zafonic's other offspring included Xaar, and Zee Zee Top. His dam Shy Lady was a Listed race winner in Germany and was descended from Shy Dawn, the dam of Opening Verse. Zafeen began his racing career in the ownership of Jaber Abdullah and was trained at West Ilsley in Berkshire by Mick Channon. Racing career 2002: two-year-old season Zafeen began his racing career in a six furlong maiden race at Salisbury Racecourse on 5 July. He started the 5/6 favourite but was beaten half a length by Big Smoke after hanging badly to the left in the final furlong. Three weeks later over the same course and distance he started odds-on favourite for a similar event and recorded his first success, taking the lead a furlong out and winning by three and a half lengths. In this race he was ridden by Steve Drowne who partnered him in his next seven races. Jaber Abullah's racing manager Joe Mercer described the winner as a \\"big, immature horse\\" who might need time to develop. Despite Mercer's comments, Zafeen was then sent to France and moved up sharply in class to contest the Group One Prix Morny at Deauville Racecourse on 25 August. Starting an 11/1 outsider in a six-runner field, he took the lead in the straight before being overtaken 200 metres from the finish and beaten three quarters of a length by Elusive City. On his return to England, Zafeen started 8/11 favourite for the Group Two Mill Reef Stakes at Newbury Racecourse on 20 September. His opponents included the Norfolk Stakes winner Baron's Pit and the Cherry Hinton Stakes runner-up Cassis. Before the race, Channon commented that the colt had \\"really thrived\\" since returning from France. Zafeen raced in second place before taking the lead a quarter of a mile from the finish and won \\"readily\\" by three quarters of a length from Monsieur Bond with Cassis in third. On his last two starts of 2002, Zafeen ran in two of Britain's most prestigious races for juveniles. In the Middle Park Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse he finished fifth of the ten runners behind Oasis Dream, after appearing to be outpaced in the closing stages. He was moved up to seven furlongs for the Dewhurst Stakes at the same track sixteen days later and ran fourth behind the 25/1 outsider Tout Seul. 2003: three-year-old season Zafeen's three- year-old debut came in the Greenham Stakes (a trial race for the 2000 Guineas) over seven furlongs at Newbury. He took the lead a quarter of a mile from the finish before being overtaken by Muqbil in the final furlong and finishing second, one and a quarter lengths behind the winner. On 3 May the colt started a 33/1 outsider behind the favourite Hold That Tiger in a twenty-runner field for the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket, with the other contenders including his previous rivals Muqbil, Tout Seul and Monsieur Bond. The colt briefly struggled to obtain a clear run a furlong out but finished strongly to take second place, three-quarters of a length behind the winner Refuse To Bend. Three weeks later Zafeen was sent to Ireland for the Irish 2,000 Guineas on soft ground at the Curragh and started the 11/2 third favourite. He raced just behind the leaders until the last three furlongs but then dropped away and finished fifteenth of the sixteen runners behind Indian Haven, who won by a length from the Aidan O'Brien-trained France. Darryll Holland took over from Drowne when Zafeen was one of eleven colts to contest the 158th running of the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot on 17 June. The lightly-raced Heron Stakes winner Kalaman (later renamed Oriental Magic) started 5/2 favourite ahead of Clodovil (Poule d'Essai des Poulains), and Indian Haven with Zafeen Next in the betting on 8/1. The other runners included Hold That Tiger, Tout Seul, France, Martillo (Mehl-M√ºlhens-Rennen) and Statue of Liberty (Coventry Stakes). Holland positioned the colt behind the leaders as France led the field until the straight. Zafeen hung to the right a he began hi challenge a quarter of a mile out but recovered to overtake France approaching the final furlong and then held off the late run of Kalaman to win by a length. There was a gap of three lengths back to Martillo who took third ahead of Hold That Tiger and Clodovil. The closing stages of the race where extremely rough, with several horses being badly hampered, but Zafeen avoided most of the trouble. The Independent's Richard Edmondson likened Zafeen to a man who had emerged from the toilet in the aftermath of a bar-room brawl and picked his way through the wreckage. A \\"hyperventilating\\" Channon said \\"When he kicked I knew it would take a bloody good horse to beat him. I love winning anywhere but this is a bit special\\". Channon also explained that the change in jockey had been on the insistence of Jaber Abdullah, saying \\"I feel sorry for Steve (Drowne). He did nothing wrong in Ireland, but that is the way it goes sometimes\\" and admitted that the colt's performance at the Curragh had left him and the stable team \\"scratching our heads\\" for an explanation. A week later, Channon said that the colt would be given a short break from racing, saying \\"He's been asked to go for everything up to now and deserves a rest\\". On his final appearance of the season, Zafeen was matched against older horses in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood on 30 July. The race produced a five-way blanket finish, with Zafeen, having briefly led the field in the straight finishing fourth, beaten a head, a short head and a neck by Reel Buddy, Statue of Liberty and Norse Dancer, and a neck in front of Moon Ballad. He was subsequently transferred to the ownership of Godolphin but did not race again. Assessment In the International Classification for 2003 (which rated horses racing in Europe, North America and Japan), Zafeen was rated the best three-year-old over one mile and the equal twenty-eighth best racehorse of any age or sex.2003 International Classification Stud record Zafeen was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion for the Darley Stud. After being based at the Overbury Stud in Gloucestershire until October 2009 when he was sold privately to the Haras du Petit Tellier in Normandy. His stud fee for 2015 was ‚Ç¨7000. He has not been particularly successful but has sired the Prix d'Arenberg winner This Time as well as the Listed winners Aventador (Prix Ridgway) and Son Cesio (Prix Hampton).

It is often called The Week in Westminster. It is the fifth longest-running radio broadcast on British radio, between Daily Service (2 January 1928) and Sunday Half Hour (14 July 1940). History Women in parliament It was first broadcast on 6 November 1929 on the BBC Home Service.BBC History Ramsay MacDonald was the Prime Minister at the time, after the 1929 General Election on 30 May 1929, when the Labour Party had won the most seats (287) in a general election for the first time. The 1929 general election was known as the Flapper Election because it was the first general election in which women over 21 had been allowed to vote. The Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928 had been given Royal Assent on 2 July 1928. Men were also allowed to vote when over the age of 21. Only in the Representation of the People Act 1969 would the age be lowered to 18, but people aged under 21 could not stand as MPs. Women's broadcasting on the Home Service had been initiated by Hilda Matheson OBE (7 June 1888- 30 October 1940). The programme was at 10.45am on each Wednesday and first known as The Week in Parliament. As parliament, and its affairs, was thought to be a new institution to most women by the patriarchal-run BBC, it was decided to create a radio programme whereby female MPs would broadcast short talks to the nation's women, to help them familiarise the parliamentary processes and significances. The first presenter was Scottish. Margaret Bondfield was the first British female cabinet minister, when she became Minister of Labour in June 1929. Lord Reith approved of the programme, and wrote of it, \\"it is chiefly for the benefit of housewives but covering also a large mixed audience of shift-workers, unemployed, invalids, etcetera\\". In 1931, male MPs were also given a slot on the programme to expound their opinions. The programme had become more well-known by then. In the late 1930s the programme's producer was Guy Burgess, later found to be a Soviet spy. World War II During the Second World War, the programme had an (enforced) eighteen month break. Wider coverage Margaret Thatcher gave the broadcast on 10 April 1965. By the late 1960s presenters other than actual MPs, such as political journalists, were given slots. In the late 1990s, the Controller of Radio 4 moved the programme to late Thursday nights. A protest ensued and it was restored to Saturday mornings. Content The programme today is not presented by actual MPs, as it was before the 1960s, but by political journalists. They interview a small group of backbench MPs in the studio, interspersed with features. It is broadcast for a half-hour on Saturday mornings, and is available as a podcast. It does not run during parliamentary recesses. Audio broadcasting from the Houses of Parliament began in 1976. Television entered the House of Lords in 1985, and the House of Commons in 1989.

Life Thomas Bennet was born in York, but the Bennet family appears to have come from the south of England. His father was Sir John Bennet, a wealthy politician and judge whose career had ended prematurely when he was found guilty of taking bribes. Thomas was the judge's second son, but on the evidence of his own wealth at the time of his death, he was more successful than his elder brother. Thomas Bennet's mother was Anne Weeks/Bennet, the first of his father's two wives. Although both his father and his son sat as members of the English parliament, Thomas Bennet did not. Bennet prepared for a legal career, entering All Souls College, Oxford in 1613, and emerging with a qualification in Law in 1615. He received his Doctorate of Law on 3 July 1624. By that time he was a member of Gray's Inn, to which he \\"may have been admitted in 1617\\". He joined the Doctors' Commons (lawyers' society) in 1624, becoming a full member of it in 1626. He gained admission to the College of Advocates on 26 January 1626. While he was making his career in advocacy, he also found time to serve as a Commissioner for piracy in London in 1633, 1635 and again in 1638. On 8 June 1635 Thomas Bennet became a Master in Chancery. Sources suggest that during the vicious civil war that engulfed England in the middle of the century, his sympathies may have tended to the royalist cause, and that he might have been among those expelled from Oxford following the parliamentarian purge of the city in the later 1640s. However, as far as is known Thomas Bennet was able to avoid incurring destructive wrath from the republican leadership which took over the reins of power following the execution of the king early in 1649. Throughout the Commonwealth years Bennet retained his post as Master in Chancery. The nation underwent further r√©gime change in May 1660 when the republic was replaced by monarchy. Thomas Bennet was knighted on 21 August 1661. His cousin, Sir Thomas Bennet of Cambridgeshire, had already been created a baronet the previous year. It was presumably in connection with his cousin, Sir Thomas Bennet of Babraham in Cambridgeshire, that by the time he died, the lawyer Thomas Bennet was himself recorded as being in possession of \\"a seat\\" at \\"Baberham\\" (sic). Nevertheless, when he died on 27 June 1670 he was living in the south of England on his estate at Salthrop in Wiltshire. It is thought that he had been predeceased by his daughter Thomasine. He was, however, survived by the daughter of his first marriage, Mary, and by the son of his second marriage, Thomas.

It was built from 1889 to 1890. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 12 December 1996. It was destroyed by fire in 2009 and removed from the Queensland Heritage Register in 2014.  History  Caboonbah Homestead was built in 1889-90 for grazier Henry Plantagenet Somerset and his wife Katherine Rose (n√©e McConnel) and their family. Henry Plantagenet Somerset, connected to an important English military family, arrived in Moreton Bay in 1871 at the age of 19 years, intending to stay only until he could obtain an English army commission. Instead, he took up stock work and station management in Queensland and New South Wales. In 1879 he married Katherine Rose, daughter of pioneer Brisbane Valley squatter David Cannon McConnel of Cressbrook Station. Somerset had worked for the McConnels, learning station skills at Cressbrook during 1872, and then managing Mount Marlow station for them. During the 1880s Somerset managed a New South Wales pastoral station and meatworks before returning to Queensland to purchase a property of his own. In 1888 he secured approximately in the Mount Stanley area of the Brisbane Valley as a grazing farm, intending to erect his family home there. He engaged a brickmaker to start making bricks for the chimneys, and employed men to pit-saw pine logs brought down from the ranges. However, respecting the McConnels' wish that the two families should avoid the 19 river crossings between Cressbrook and Mount Stanley, Somerset agreed to exchange of his Mount Stanley land for of freehold Cressbrook land at the junction of the Brisbane and Stanley Rivers. Somerset called this property Caboonbah, derived from the Aboriginal Cabon gibba meaning big rock, describing the steep, high bank of the Brisbane River on which Caboonbah homestead was built. The property, mostly comprising rich alluvial flats, was divided into 7 paddocks and was devoted to fattening bullocks, dairying and horse-breeding. Some sheep were also run, but eventually these were replaced by goats. In 1892 the first cattle to cross the d'Aguilar Range were a mob of fat bullocks from Caboonbah. Work on Caboonbah Homestead commenced in late 1889 and was completed during the summer floods of 1890. The brickmaker employed at Mount Stanley made 30,000 bricks at the head of Sapphire Gully, to the west of the house, and erected a service building containing a bakery, washhouse and storerooms. The oven fire also was used to heat water, which was then piped to the adjoining washhouse. The locally produced bricks proved to be very brittle, so bricks from Dinmore (near Ipswich) were ordered for the house chimneys. The house was constructed mostly of milled timber brought in from Nicholson's mill near Villeneuve, but some of the pine sawn at Mount Stanley was used in construction of the loft. The roof was clad in shingles, stacked wet and not dressed. This created a cooler roof, but in time the shingles warped and shrank. The Somerset family occupied their new home in March 1890, and remained there until Katherine's death in 1935. HP Somerset died the following year. Two of their ten children were born at Caboonbah, and two lie buried on the slope below the front of the house (). During the 1893 Brisbane River floods Henry Somerset was in a unique position at Caboonbah to observe the rapidly rising flood waters and to realise the potential danger to surrounding districts. When of rain fell in the Blackall Ranges in February 1893 and raised the river level to at Caboonbah Homestead, Somerset dispatched a messenger on horseback to Esk to telegraph Brisbane of the impending danger. Two weeks later the Brisbane River rose again, and finding the Esk telegraph line down, Somerset rowed across the flooded Brisbane River, two horses swimming in tow, to send a rider across the d'Aguilar Range to Caboolture to telegraph Brisbane. The first message was ignored or misinterpreted, but as a result of Somerset's efforts Caboonbah was made Queensland's first flood warning station, with a telegraph line to Cressbrook Station carrying a family-operated Morse for 8? years until a telephone line was installed in the early 1900s. The flood warning station was manned by the Somersets for 40 years, 1893‚Äì1933, without remuneration. Henry Somerset sustained heavy financial losses, estimated at about , during the 1893 floods and was obliged to sell his Mount Stanley holdings to secure the family homestead at Caboonbah against debt. Both Henry and Katherine Somerset were prominent in Brisbane Valley community work. From 1890 to 1904 Henry was a member of the Esk Divisional Board, later the Esk Shire Council, and finally its chairman. With Mrs Lumley-Hill of Bellevue Station, Katherine was co- founder of the Stanley Memorial Hospital (now the Esk and District Hospital). In 1905 the Somersets founded the Caboonbah Undenominational Church, donating the land and standing timber, the latter exchanged for seasoned timber from Lars Andersen's sawmill at Esk. Prior to construction of the church Henry had held services every second Sunday either at Caboonbah or in barns on neighbouring properties and Katherine played the organ at these services. From 1904 to 1920 Henry Somerset served as the Member of the Legislative Assembly for Stanley, being returned 6 times by his electorate. Due to his representations the Brisbane Valley railway was extended to Blackbutt in 1911 and finally to Yarraman in 1913. He was also a prominent supporter of the rural schools movement. His early contributions to the welfare of the district were honoured when Stanley became part of the larger electorate of Somerset. Henry Somerset was also the first to suggest the site of the present Somerset Dam, named in his honour. Following the 1893 floods and their devastating effects on the Brisbane River valley, various flood mitigation schemes were proposed to modify the run-off of the Brisbane and Stanley Rivers, but none were adopted. The 1901-1902 drought highlighted the need for water storage above Mount Crosby Pumping Station to meet Brisbane's growing water consumption. In 1906, when the Brisbane Water Board was proposing to utilise the lake on Stradbroke Island to augment Brisbane's water supply, Somerset invited the Board to send an engineer to inspect the Stanley Gorge, suggesting that a dam across the gorge would serve two purposes: flood mitigation in the Brisbane River Valley, and increased storage for Brisbane's water supply. Eminent American engineer Allan Hazen also inspected the site and agreed that it had potential for future development, but recommended that a dam on Cabbage Tree Creek would solve Brisbane's more immediate needs. Lake Manchester, on Cabbage Tree Creek, was completed in 1916, putting the Stanley River proposal on hold. The 1928 Gutteridge commission of enquiry into Brisbane's Water Supply recommended that reservoirs be constructed on the Brisbane River at Middle Creek and on the Stanley River at Little Mount Brisbane, but no action was taken until 1933, when the Forgan-Smith Labor Government adopted the Brisbane River Valley flood mitigation and water supply scheme (Stanley Dam) as a major employment-generating project during an era of severe economic depression. By 1935 work on the dam itself had commenced, and in that year district residents requested that the name of the dam be changed to Somerset, honouring the man who first proposed the site. The town established for the dam workers was also named Somerset. The dam structure was largely in place by 1941, but in 1943 the workforce was diverted to the war effort. The dam was opened in 1953, and in late 1958 Queensland Premier Frank Nicklin unveiled a memorial plaque officially naming the dam after Henry Plantagenet Somerset. Following Katherine Somerset's death in 1935, the Somerset home and a small portion of the original property of was sold to the Grieve family, who operated Caboonbah as a guest house until 1962. In 1963 the house was purchased as a private residence by Neville Carseldine. Caboonbah was resumed in 1973 by the Queensland Government as part of the Wivenhoe Dam project, and was leased for 10 years by Mr Carseldine's brother Max until 1983, when the Brisbane Valley Historical Society obtained an occupation permit. The property was transferred later to the Brisbane and Area Water Board, which removed all but one of the original timber outbuildings associated with the homestead. Caboonbah Homestead remained the headquarters of the Brisbane Valley Historical Society. Following meticulous restoration, the Caboonbah Homestead was opened to the public in 1989. The society also relocated to the grounds two early 20th century cottages, the 1928 Esk Court House, and a cell block from Esk (but do not form part of the heritage listing). In 2000, the movie Deluge: the true story of the Great Brisbane Flood of 1893 starring local actor Ray Barrett presented the story of Somerset and his attempts to warn of the impending flood. The Caboonbah Homestead burned down on 10 May 2009.  Description  View of Brisbane River from the Caboonbah Homestead, looking south-east, 2010 View of Brisbane River from the Caboonbah Homestead, looking south-west, 2010 Caboonbah Homestead was a large, single-storeyed timber residence situated on the elevated south bank of the Brisbane River, three miles below its junction with the Stanley River. The house overlooked Lake Wivenhoe. The building was low set on timber stumps and has a hardwood frame clad in profiled timber boarding. There were timber verandahs to the north, east and south elevations. The roof was of galvanised iron, fixed over original the timber shingles, on a pitched hardwood frame. The homestead had been extended a number of times. The large entrance porch on the eastern elevation was an addition with a low pitched projecting gable. The battened gable end and detailing of the verandah posts and railings indicated that this was probably added in the 1920s. The original plan was a central corridor with four main rooms, an attached service wing and verandahs to the north, east and south. The verandahs were partially enclosed and contained a series of small rooms. To the north west at the rear of the homestead a wing was added parallel to the original service wing. The detailing of this wing including the bay window indicates that this wing was added in the 1920s. Internally the homestead retained many of the original fittings, including cedar surrounds to the fireplaces and a coved timber ceiling in the dining room. A masonry service building was adjacent to the homestead on the western side. The floor was concrete, the walls were of hand-made brick with some minor timber frame divisions, and it had a corrugated galvanised iron roof. There was a verandah to the north wall which returns part way round the east wall. On the southern elevation was an open covered recess.  Heritage listing  Caboonbah Homestead was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 12 December 1996 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Caboonbah Homestead, erected 1889‚Äì90, is important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history, being associated with the establishment of the first flood warning station in Queensland in 1893. The place is also closely associated with local social and political events, in particular representing the legislative power of the Queensland Government in the Stanley electorate from 1904 to 1920. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Caboonbah Homestead makes a significant contribution to the Queensland estate, illustrating the principal characteristics of a substantial, late 19th century timber homestead with early 20th century additions. The design, with its wide, low verandahs onto which every room opens, high ceilings, opening fanlights above French doors, roof ventilator and low timber stumps, illustrates the adaptation of traditional British architectural taste to Queensland climatic conditions. A lack of refurbishment in a more pretentious style to accompany the increasing status of its owners reflects the aesthetic and cultural values of our nation builders. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Caboonbah Homestead has a special association for the local community with the early development of the Caboonbah area, with state politics in the Stanley (now part of Somerset) electorate for 16 years, and with the construction of the Somerset dam, one of Queensland's most important mid-20th century projects. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Caboonbah Homestead has a special association with the life and work of Henry Plantagenet Somerset and his wife Katherine Rose McConnel, who lived at Caboonbah from 1890 until Katherine's death in 1935. The Somersets were prominent in Brisbane Valley and later Queensland affairs from 1890 to 1920. In particular, Henry Somerset is associated with the establishment of Caboonbah as the first flood warning station in Queensland, and with the selection of the site for the Somerset Dam, named in his honour.

He was educated at The Oratory School in Edgbaston, Birmingham, matriculating in 1889. He then studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, receiving a BA in 1893 and an MA in 1896.  Professional work and other interests  Cave served as a Justice of the Peace for Hampshire in 1906. He was President of the Royal Meteorological Society in the years 1913 and 1914 and again in 1924 and 1925. During the First World War he was a captain in the Meteorological Section of the Royal Engineers, serving in England and France as an instructor, experimenter and forecaster. In 1915 his installation at Aldershot of a lightning recorder enabled aircraft pilots to be warned of approaching thunderstorms, putting Britain ahead of other nations in this respect. He was a Member of the International Commission for Investigation of the Upper Air from the early 20th century onwards. He was a keen yachtsman and navigator, through which he developed an interest in astronomy. On 11 January 1918 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society. Cave was also a skilled camera technician, and through his meteorological interests took many photographs of clouds. Later in his career, his study of telephotography led to an interest in antiquarian subjects: he took more than 8,000 photographs of roof carvings in medieval English churches and cathedrals, on which he was regarded as a leading authority. One of his later projects was to measure the orientation of 642 churches, finding that only 103 of them were on at least an approximate east-west line. He published papers in Archaeologia and the Antiquaries Journal, among others. His documentary archive, together with a large collection of photographs and camera equipment, are held at the Society of Antiquaries of London.

A pioneer in applied psychology, Bingham got his start in experimental psychology, receiving his Ph.D. at the University of Chicago under James R. Angell. Bingham went from Dartmouth in 1915 to organize the Division of Applied Psychology at the Carnegie Institute of Technology. When war came to the United States, Bingham was recruited by Robert Yerkes as a member of a small group that developed the Army Alpha and Beta tests. During World War I Bingham served as executive secretary of the committee on classification of personnel in the U.S. Army, and later in the war served as lieutenant colonel in the Personnel Branch of the Army General Staff. From 1940 to 1947 Bingham was chief psychologist of the Adjutant General's Office of the War Department, serving as consultant or advisor to the Surgeon General, the Army General Staff, and the Secretary of Defense. Walter Bingham's contribution on the army classification methods paved the development of the field of industrial psychology. Bingham carried out editorial responsibilities for several journals and was the author of over 200 articles and books. His \\"Aptitude and Aptitude Testing\\" (1937/1942) is a classic in the field. Education and early career Walter Van Dyke Bingham was born in Swan Lake City, Iowa to Lemuel and Martha Bingham. Deemed an exceptional student early on, Bingham skipped the 3rd and 4th grades, graduating high school at the age of 16. He was an industrious youth, selling enough popcorn at the train station to pay his way to Chicago's 1893 World's Fair. Upon graduating from high school, Walter took a job as a rodman on the Burlington, Cedar Rapids and Northern Railway. His first job outside of the home was a printer's devil, inking forms for the weekly edition of the Emmet County Republican. Bingham was accepted to Beloit College in Wisconsin, graduating with honors in 1901 at the age of twenty. For a time, he taught mathematics and physics at Beloit Academy and Elgin High School. Bingham went on to study at Harvard University, receiving a master's degree in 1907. He continued his scholarship at both Harvard, working in Hugo M√ºnsterberg‚Äôs lab under the direction of Edwin B. Holt, and The University of Chicago under the direction of James Angell, receiving two doctoral degrees in 1908. His dissertation, entitled, ‚ÄúStudies in Melody and Movement‚Äù was based on vast experimentation examining the psychophysiological effects of melody on humans. Under Angell, psychology became firmly established as an empirical subject using experimental methods. He developed a functionalist theory of psychological processes and mind-body relationships, specifically, the status accorded to the study of reflexive consciousness as well as physiological status. Similarly, Edwin B. Holt's Industrial/Organizational approach was also heavily based in experimentation. He looked at problems with monotony, attention and fatigue, physical and social influences on the working power, the effects of advertising, and the future development of economic psychology. Each of the two men mentoring Bingham had profound influence on Bingham's career and research trajectory. After receiving his doctoral degree, Bingham took a postdoctoral position as a teacher's assistant to Edward Thorndike at Teacher's College of Columbia University. In 1915, after serving as an assistant professor at Dartmouth College, he was invited to Carnegie Institute of Technology to create a unit that would use psychology to help students with career choices. While at Carnegie he embarked on his pioneering venture of using psychology as a tool to help clarify the problems of some of the large industries in the Pittsburgh area. At the same time, with the founding of a division of applied psychology, he endeavored to provide instruction for students planning careers in industrial management and other fields where success depended in some measure on the ability to understand and influence people. He hoped the instruction would enable such students to have a better understanding of human behavior. This work antedated such well-known historical developments in applied psychology as the Committee on Classification of Personnel in the army in 1917‚Äì1918 and the formation in 1919‚Äì1923 of the Scott Company, the first personnel consulting firm of applied psychologists. Bingham created the Bureau of mental tests and in 1916, an umbrella organization, the Division of Applied Psychology which developed into the first organized academic/industry cooperative personnel research program. World Wars and Intelligence Testing In 1917, immediately after the United States entered the First World War, a small team of psychologists‚ÄîBingham among them‚Äîheaded by Robert M. Yerkes was deployed to design group intelligence tests that could identify recruits with low intelligence and allow the Army to recognize men who were particularly well-suited for special assignments and officers‚Äô training schools. It was believed that he had a unique gift in identifying talented individuals. The final forms of the Army Alpha and Beta tests were published in January 1919, and by the end of the war they had been administered to approximately two million men. Bingham spent the years after the First World War writing books and articles emphasizing the civilian applications of the testing procedures he helped develop for the Army. He believed that aptitude tests and intelligence subtest scores could be used to help businesses increase the efficiency of their workforce. Further, it would help teachers and counselors direct their students and clients to careers that would make them happy. Bingham also noted that aptitude testing would be useful for identifying the types of jobs at which the developmentally disabled could be successful. The onslaught of World War II brought a new position as Chief psychologist in the Army Adjutant General's office to Bingham. In 1940, he was appointed Chairman of the Army National Research Council on Classification of Military Personnel. His research team created a series of aptitude tests that served several purposes. Bingham believed that these aptitude tests would help the war effort through increasing American military might. He asserted that the human engineering made possible by the administration of aptitude tests would increase the efficiency and effectiveness of military training programs in the same way that mechanical engineering maximizes the effectiveness of tanks, guns, and airplanes. By 1941, standardized test scores had been recorded for more than a million military men. His planning and consulting services to the army in World War II are acknowledged by the inscription, ‚Äúarchitect of the classification system of the army, 1940‚Äì1947,‚Äù which appears on his headstone in Arlington National Cemetery. Professional life Throughout his tenure with the American military, Bingham continued to hold a variety of professional roles. He remained Director of the Personnel Research Federation at Carnegie and assisted in editing the Personnel Journal which he helped found at Carnegie in 1922. He served as president of the Psychological Corporation from 1926 to 1928 and was appointed professorial lecturer in psychology at Stevens Institute of Technology in 1930. Applied psychology grew in importance during and immediately following World War I, and Bingham came to hold many responsible positions. As aforementioned, he served as executive secretary of the Committee on Classification of Personnel in the army in 1917‚Äì1918; he held the rank of lieutenant colonel in the personnel branch of the U.S. Army General Staff in 1918‚Äì1919; and he was the first chairman of the division of anthropology and psychology of the National Research Council in 1919‚Äì1920. In 1927 he served as the American member of the board of the International Congress of Techno-psychology. In 1942 Bingham was appointed director of the Personnel Research Foundation Inc., where for many years he carried on independent research and served as a consultant in industrial psychology. Additionally, Bingham served as president of the American Association of Applied Psychology (1937) and past secretary of the American Psychological Association (1942). As applied and industrial psychology grew in prominence, Bingham became focused on the measurement of the abilities of able and brilliant students and the early identification of the gifted. This aspect of his work was honored after his death by the American Psychological Association with the establishment of an annual lectureship in his name. The lectures have two purposes: to bring to the attention of psychologists and others the great value of accurate identification of exceptionally promising young people; and to honor psychologists and institutions working in this field. Bingham was the author of over two hundred articles and books. He wrote on a wide variety of topics ranging from articles on tonal fusion, vocal functions, and studies in melody to such topics as the search for skill and talent in the army, skill identification and development in academia and industry, and reliability, validity, and dependability of psychological assessment tools. Two of his books, How to Interview (Bingham & Moore 1931) and Aptitudes and Aptitude Testing (1937), are classics in the field of personnel psychology and guidance. Bingham's works have been widely used and his research established training in applied psychology as a respectable and common part of the curriculum at institutions of higher learning. Due in large part to Bingham, the testing movement flourished. Research in industrial psychology, guidance and counseling, and personnel psychology has proceeded to develop in many of the problem areas along the lines he suggested. Additionally, his hope that more attention would be paid to students of high ability has certainly been realized in the greatly increased research and educational activity in this area. Bingham's contribution to applied psychology transformed psychology from the academic (science) to the real world (practice). Throughout the many positions he held during his lifetime, he made a point to show those he affected that psychology could be used to tap into the ability of individuals while using this as a method to match the right people to the right career roles. Today, personnel psychology aids in the recruitment, selection, placement, psychometrics, performance appraisal, training and development and legal issues (Equal Employment Opportunity) Title VII, CRA 1991. This methodology encompasses measuring and predicting individual differences in behavior and job performance in the workplace. Research in this field is used to increase workplace productivity, select employees best suited for particular jobs, and product testing. Since the founding of the Carnegie program in 1915, Bingham's research, vision, and work have determined in large measure the directions that applied and industrial psychology have taken today. Applied and Industrial Psychology The field of applied psychology is the use of psychological methods and findings of scientific psychology to solve practical problems of human and animal behavior and experience. Some of the areas of applied psychology include: clinical psychology, counseling psychology, evolutionary psychology, industrial and organizational psychology, legal psychology, neuropsychology, occupational health psychology, human factors, forensic psychology, engineering psychology, school psychology, sports psychology, traffic psychology, community psychology, and medical psychology. Industrial and organizational psychology (I/O) specializes in the psychology of the workforce, customer, and consumer, including issues such as the psychology of recruitment, selecting employees from an applicant pool, training, performance appraisal, job satisfaction, work motivation, work behavior, stress at work, and management. Military psychology includes research into the classification, training, and performance of soldiers and is an additional branch of I/O psychology. Personal life In 1920, Walter Bingham married Millicent Todd. Millicent Todd Bingham was the first woman to receive a doctorate in geology and geography from Harvard and a leading expert on Emily Dickinson. She had distinguished careers in both geography and literature. Throughout the marriage, Millicent took an active interest in Bingham's work, writing Beyond Psychology after his death in 1953, in memory of her husband.

Work Brett's main contribution to psychology was his three-volume History of Psychology (1912‚Äì1921), which was the first history of psychology written in the English language, pre-dating Edwin Boring's canonical History of Experimental Psychology (1929). Brett's work occurs in the wake of the divorce between Psychology and Philosophy, a divorce in which Psychology was to undergo several changes in identity beginning with its attempt to be a \\"Science of consciousness\\" leading to a revisionist behavioural definition, the \\"Science of behaviour\\" which in its turn was tied to the influence of observational-ism and the anti-Metaphysical positivist spirit of the times. Brett's own position is one in which he claims that Psychology lies at the confluence of three great traditions of inquiry: Religious/Philosophical inquiry, Medical inquiry and what he calls \\"Psychological\\" inquiry. He further states that it is difficult to distinguish the History of Psychology from the History of Philosophy. His volumes thus begin with the Pre-Socratics and trace metaphysical investigations insofar as they are connected with issues of Philosophical Psychology up to but not including twentieth-century theories. He presents the metaphysics of Psychology insightfully but not always adequately, failing, for example, to appreciate the depth of Aristotelian and Kantian Philosophical contributions to Psychology. R S Peters revived Brett'swork by carrying our a successful abridgment of his three volumes into one. In this work, Peters added reflections on twentieth-century Theories that attempted to follow the pattern of Brett's earlier volumes. Brett guided courses and appointments in Toronto for many years.

Formed in April 1919 in Poznan, it fought in the Polish-Soviet War and the Invasion of Poland. In the interbellum period, the regiment was garrisoned in Grudziadz (since September 1923). Pomeranian uhlans became famous for the legendary Charge at Krojanty, after which the unit ceased to exist.  Beginnings  In April 1919, following the order of commandant of Greater Poland Front, General Jozef Dowbor-Musnicki, a cavalry unit was formed in Poznan. In July 1919, the unit was named 4th Greater Poland Uhlan Regiment, with Colonel August Brochwitz-Donimirski (former officer of the Imperial German Army) as its commandant. By late October 1919, First Squadron of the regiment was fully equipped and trained. The unit was tasked with seizing parts of formerly German province of West Prussia, which were attached to Poland (see Polish Corridor). On January 18, 1920, it entered Torun, to be later moved to Grudziadz after the Germans had abandoned this city. In February 1920, its name was officially changed into the 18th Pomeranian Uhlan Regiment, and in late May 1920, the regiment was sent to the Soviet front. In early summer 1920, Pomeranian uhlans fought in northeastern corner of the Second Polish Republic, along the Daugava (river), where it engaged Soviet cavalry under Hayk Bzhishkyan. On July 5, 1920, it was encircled by the enemy near Druja. To escape Soviet captivity, the uhlans decided to swim across the Daugava, and enter the territory of neutral Latvia. Polish soldiers reached Daugavpils, and on July 22 were transported by rail to Riga. Six days later, 60 Polish soldiers were loaded on the Pomeranian, but the bulk of the regiment remained in Riga. On August 11, Latvia signed a peace treaty with Soviet Russia. Fearing disarmament by the Latvian authorities, the Poles marched towards the port of Memel, which at that time was a free city, occupied by French troops. The regiment reached Palanga, where it was disarmed. After several days, the uhlans in mufti, were loaded on boats, and on August 18 arrived at Danzig. Unable to anchor at this port, the regiment finally left the boats at nearby Gdynia. On August 22, the unit returned to Torun. The Pomeranian uhlans remained in Torun until mid-September 1920, when they were transported by rail to Hajnowka. At that time, the regiment had 32 officers, 630 soldiers and 610 horses. On September 19, the unit was attached to Operational Group of General Wladyslaw Jung, and was sent to the frontline near Wolkowysk, to fight in the Battle of the Niemen River. Pomeranian uhlans remained in eastern Poland until May 5, 1921, when they returned to Grudziadz.  1939 Invasion of Poland  On August 26, 1939, the regiment, commanded by Colonel Kazimierz Masztalerz, became part of Chojnice Group of Polish Army. The unit was tasked with protecting the area of Chojnice and nearby Rytel. The Germans attacked Polish positions on September 1, 1939, at 5 a.m. After initial clashes, the uhlans were forced to withdraw. In the evening of the first day of the war, the Charge at Krojanty took place. Following the charge, and subsequent Luftwaffe attack near Drzycim, the regiment ceased to exist as a cohesive unit (September 4). Among those KIA at Krojanty, was Colonel Mastalerz himself.

The policy document \\"Transforming London Secondary Schools\\" set out the aims of the programme, which was designed to create a \\"step change\\" in the performance of London secondary schools. The initiative has been credited by Ofsted and others for a significant improvement in London's state education system. More recent studies have identified the London Challenge as one factor in several that contributed to significant enhancements in pupil outcomes. The London Challenge programme was initially aimed at secondary schools and was intended to run until 2008. However, it was subsequently extended until 2011, and expanded to include primary schools, and two additional City Challenge areas; Greater Manchester and the Black Country.  History   London Challenge (2003 - 2011) In 2002 the British Government created a new set of policies focusing on London's state secondary schools, which were at that time performing poorly in comparison to the rest of the country. The policies were collectively known as the London Challenge and their objectives were: * to raise standards in the poorest performing schools; * to narrow the attainment gap between pupils in London; * to create more good and outstanding schools. The London Challenge depended on close cooperation with Local Authorities, and in particular five Key Areas were singled out for close attention, Tower Hamlets, Newham, Lewisham, Hackney, Westminster. One of the distinctive features of London Challenge was a focus on partnership and shared purpose between schools, whilst avoiding stigmatising schools through the use of negative language. The term \\"Keys to Success\\" was used to identify those schools that would require the most intensive intervention. A series of \\"sector led\\" support mechanisms were put in place. Independent, experienced education experts, known as London Challenge Advisers, were appointed to each of the Keys to Success schools to provide tailored help. The advisers were supported by an administrative team in the Department for Education (DfE). They worked closely with experienced education professionals, appointed by the DfE, known as National Leaders of Education (NLE) or Local Leaders of Education (LLE), as well as local authority appointed School Improvement Partners (SIP) and other local authority officers to develop a bespoke intervention programmes. The cost of the support and the services brokered by the adviser came directly from the DfE. In some areas school improvement services were outsourced to consultants, though from 2007 specialist services to the Keys to Success schools were supplied by a single education consultancy company under a Challenge Service Contract. School to school peer support was also a feature of the London Challenge programme. Some particularly successful schools were awarded Teaching School status, giving them the remit and opportunity to support other schools in their local community. Another initiative was the annual \\"Families of Schools\\" report which grouped all of London's state schools into numbered families with other similar schools. This was aimed at middle and senior leaders in schools, allowing them to compare their performance with their peer schools and to share best practice on improvement initiatives, although there is no evidence that the resource was widely used for those purposes. The London Challenge incorporated the 14-19 Pathfinders initiative which aimed to define and develop improved \\"learning pathways\\" for students in this age group. For schools that needed support beyond the classroom, the Extended School concept was introduced, creating hubs for services to be offered directly to students and their families. The London Challenge also introduced the Teach First initiative to encourage highly academic graduates into the teaching profession. In 2008 the Government announced an expansion of the London Challenge to include primary schools, and the programme was extended until 2011.  City Challenge (2008 - 2011) The 2008 extension of the London Challenge initiative also expanded it to include two new geographical areas ‚Äì Greater Manchester and the Black Country. The programme was renamed for those areas as the City Challenge, but continued to be known as the London Challenge in the capital. The City Challenge programme was tailored to local needs, using many of the same approaches adopted in the London Challenge.  Evaluation  Ofsted first reported on the impact of the London Challenge in 2006, and found that, between 2001 and 2005, London's GCSE results had improved faster in London than in England as a whole. A subsequent report in 2010 corroborated those findings, finding that the \\"London Challenge has continued to improve outcomes for pupils in London‚Äôs primary and secondary schools at a faster rate than nationally. London‚Äôs secondary schools continue to perform better than those in the rest of England\\". A Government commissioned report from the Institute for Policy Studies in Education, published in 2012, evaluated the outcomes of the City Challenge programme and, retrospectively the London Challenge Programme. It found that the majority of the initial targets were achieved, and while acknowledging the backdrop of wider educational initiatives concluded that the \\"most plausible explanation for the greater improvement in Challenge areas is that the City Challenge programme was responsible\\". A report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation in 2014 concluded that \\"during the period of the London Challenge, secondary school performance in London saw a dramatic improvement, and local authorities in inner London went from the worst performing to the best performing nationally.\\" However they noted the difficulty of isolating the specific effect of the London Challenge against a wider background of education policy changes. The report's assessment of the City Challenge was more mixed \\"in part because [the City Challenge areas] had less time for these practices to properly embed.\\" However it was found that some positive developments had been sustained beyond the end of the City Challenge programme in 2011. Also in 2014, the CfBT Education Trust published findings of their own investigation into the reported success of London schools during the period of the London Challenge. This concluded that this success couldn't be explained in terms of contextual advantages such as gentrification, ethnicity and opportunity. Nor could they be fully attributable to resourcing factors such as finance, teacher recruitment and school building quality, although these did help the improvements to \\"flourish\\". The success was, instead, attributed to the combined effect of four Government interventions: London Challenge, Teach First, the academies programme and improved support from local authorities. It was also concluded to be dependent on \\"effective leadership at every level of the system\\". Later the same year, research from the University of Bristol largely attributed London's improvements in pupil progress over the London Challenge period to ethnic composition rather than specific Government interventions. Nevertheless, the paper concluded that \\"for other measures of attainment, the London premium is halved but remains significant.\\" A subsequent report by the Centre for Analysis of Social Exclusion at the LSE demonstrated that most of the London effect could be accounted for by the improved performance in London primary schools, that there had not been any significant difference in the ethnic composition in London over the timeframe studied, and that the improved performance in primaries certainly coincided with the introduction of the National Literacy Strategies, though why they might have had more impact in London than elsewhere wasn't certain. The report is called Understanding the improved performance of disadvantaged pupils in London, and can be found online. http://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/dps/case/spcc/wp21.pdf The UK's national media has shown a strong interest in the success of the London Challenge and its legacy.

The building is in flamboyant Neo- Gothic style. Originally the interior was decorated with Art Deco frescoes, but these deteriorated and have been painted over. History The Reformed Church of Reims was established by royal decree on 30 April 1832. On 15 December 1867 the Reformed Temple was opened on the Boulevard Lundy in a converted building that had formerly been a riding school. During World War I (1914‚Äì18) the temple was destroyed by incendiary shells. After the war it was rebuilt in the same location. The foundation stone was laid on 23 October 1921. The temple was dedicated on 24 June 1923 by Pastor Louis Gonin, president of the Presbyteral council of Reims. The interior walls were originally covered with Art Deco frescoes by Gustave Louis Jaulmes, representing subjects such as the Tree of Life, Tables of the Law and Huguenot Cross with tears, with many plant decorations. The pulpit, in Gothic Revival style, was dismantled in 1972. In 1973 the frescoes were covered with white paint due to their deteriorated condition. This gives the temple a sober or austere interior, more in line with the Reformed Church tradition. A great organ was built between 1972 and 1976, with 53 registers. Construction was overseen by pastor Pierre Vallotton, who was passionate about organ music and the construction of instruments. The organ was inaugurated on 17 October 1976 by Ars√®ne Muzerelle, organist of Reims Cathedral. . Building The building was designed by Charles Letrosne (1868‚Äì1938) in a flamboyant neo-Gothic style influenced by Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc. It was modeled on the Temple de l'√âtoile in Paris. The layout is that of Latin cross, which is unusual in a church built for Protestants. The nave is built in concrete on foundation piles deep. The nave is long, and the transept is long.

In Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting (Vol. 44, No. 37, pp. 650-653). SAGE Publications.  History  The Human Factors and Ergonomics Society (HFES) formed the Human Performance Modeling Technical Group in 2004. Although a recent discipline, human factors practitioners have been constructing and applying models of human performance since World War II. Notable early examples of human performance models include Paul Fitt's model of aimed motor movement (1954), the choice reaction time models of Hick (1952) and Hyman (1953), and the Swets et al. (1964) work on signal detection.Swets, J. A., Tanner, W. P., & Birdsall, T. G. (1964). Decision processes in perception. Signal detection and recognition in human observers, 3-57. It is suggested that the earliest developments in HPM arose out of the need to quantify human- system feedback for those military systems in development during WWII (see Manual Control Theory below); with continued interest in the development of these models augmented by the cognitive revolution (see Cognition & Memory below).  Human Performance Models  Human performance models predict human behavior in a task, domain, or system. However, these models must be based upon and compared against empirical human-in-the-loop data to ensure that the human performance predictions are correct. As human behavior is inherently complex, simplified representations of interactions are essential to the success of a given model. As no model is able to capture the complete breadth and detail of human performance within a system, domain, or even task, details are abstracted away to these keep models manageable. Although the omission of details is an issue in basic psychological research, it is less of a concern in applied contexts such as those of most concern to the human factors profession. This is related to the internal-external validity trade-off. Regardless, development of a human performance model is an exercise in complexity science.Warwick, W., Marusich, L., & Buchler, N. (2013, September). Complex Systems and Human Performance Modeling. In Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting (Vol. 57, No. 1, pp. 803-807). SAGE Publications. Communication and exploration of the most essential variables governing a given process are often just as important as the accurate prediction of an outcome given those variables. The goal of most human performance models is to capture enough detail in a particular domain to be useful for the purposes of investigation, design, or evaluation; thus the domain for any particular model is often quite restricted. Defining and communicating the domain of a given model is an essential feature of the practice - and of the entirety of human factors - as a systems discipline. Human performance models contain both the explicit and implicit assumptions or hypotheses upon which the model depends, and are typically mathematical - being composed of equations or computer simulations - although there are also important models that are qualitative in nature. Individual models vary in their origins, but share in their application and use for issues in the human factors perspective. These can be models of the products of human performance (e.g., a model that produces the same decision outcomes as human operators), the processes involved in human performance (e.g., a model that simulates the processes used to reach decisions), or both. Generally, they are regarded as belonging to one of three areas: perception & attention allocation, command & control, or cognition & memory; although models of other areas such as emotion, motivation, and social/group processes continue to grow burgeoning within the discipline. Integrated models are also of increasing importance ~~.~~ Anthropometric and biomechanical models are also crucial human factors tools in research and practice, and are used alongside other human performance models, but have an almost entirely separate intellectual history, being individually more concerned with static physical qualities than processes or interactions. The models are applicable in many number of industries and domains including military,Lawton, C. R., Campbell, J. E., & Miller, D. P. (2005).

SAGE Publications. manufacturing, user experience/user interface (UX/UI) design, etc. and have been used to model human-system interactions both simple and complex.  Model Categories   Command & Control  Human performance models of Command & Control describe the products of operator output behavior, and are often also models of dexterity within the interactions for certain tasks. = Hick-Hyman Law = Hick (1952) and Hyman (1953) note that the difficulty of a choice reaction- time task is largely determined by the information entropy of the situation. They suggested that information entropy (H) is a function of the number of alternatives (n) in a choice task, H = log2(n + 1); and that reaction time (RT) of a human operator is a linear function of the entropy: RT = a + bH. This is known as the Hick-Hyman law for choice response time. = Pointing = Pointing at stationary targets such as buttons, windows, images, menu items, and controls on computer displays is commonplace and has a well- established modeling tool for analysis - Fitt's law (Fitts, 1954) - which states that the time to make an aimed movement (MT) is a linear function of the index of difficulty of the movement: MT = a + bID. The index of difficulty (ID) for any given movement is a function of the ratio of distance to the target (D) and width of the target (W): ID = log2(2D/W) - a relationship derivable from information theory. Fitt's law is actually responsible for the ubiquity of the computer mouse, due to the research of Card, English, and Burr (1978). Extensions of Fitt's law also apply to pointing at spatially moving targets, via the steering law, originally discovered by C.G. Drury in 1971 and later on rediscovered in the context of human-computer interaction by Accott & Zhai (1997, 1999). = Manual Control Theory = Complex motor tasks, such as those carried out by musicians and athletes, are not well modeled due to their complexity. Human target-tracking behavior, however, is one complex motor task that is an example of successful HPM. The history of manual control theory is extensive, dating back to the 1800s in regard to the control of water clocks. However, during the 1940s with the innovation of servomechanisms in WWII, extensive research was put into the continuous control and stabilization of contemporary systems such as radar antennas, gun turrets, and ships/aircraft via feedback control signals. Analysis methods were developed that predicted the required control systems needed to enable stable, efficient control of these systems (James, Nichols, & Phillips, 1947). Originally interested in temporal response - the relationship between sensed output and motor output as a function of time - James et al. (1947) discovered that the properties of such systems are best characterized by understanding temporal response after it had been transformed into a frequency response; a ratio of output to input amplitude and lag in response over the range of frequencies to which they are sensitive. For systems that respond linearly to these inputs, the frequency response function could be expressed in a mathematical expression called a transfer function. This was applied first to machine systems, then human-machine systems for maximizing human performance. Tustin (1947), concerned with the design of gun turrets for human control, was first to demonstrate that nonlinear human response could be approximated by a type of transfer function. McRuer and Krenzel (1957) synthesized all the work since Tustin (1947), measuring and documenting the characteristics of the human transfer function, and ushered in the era of manual control models of human performance. As electromechanical and hydraulic flight control systems were implemented into aircraft, automation and electronic artificial stability systems began to allow human pilots to control highly sensitive systems These same transfer functions are still used today in control engineering. From this, the optimal control model (Pew & Baron, 1978) developed in order to model a human operator's ability to internalize system dynamics and minimize objective functions, such as root mean square (RMS) error from the target. The optimal control model also recognizes noise in the operator's ability to observe the error signal, and acknowledges noise in the human motor output system. Technological progress and subsequent automation have reduced the necessity and desire of manual control of systems, however. Human control of complex systems is now often of a supervisory nature over a given system, and both human factors and HPM have shifted from investigations of perceptual- motor tasks, to the cognitive aspects of human performance.  Attention & Perception  = Signal Detection Theory (SDT) = Although not a formal part of HPM, signal detection theory has an influence on the method, especially within the Integrated Models. SDT is almost certainly the best- known and most extensively used modeling framework in human factors, and is a key feature of education regarding human sensation and perception. In application, the situation of interest is one in which a human operator has to make a binary judgement about whether a signal is present or absent in a noise background. This judgement may be applied in any number of vital contexts. Besides the response of the operator, there are two possible \\"true\\" states of the world - either the signal was present or it was not. If the operator correctly identifies the signal as present, this is termed a hit (H). If the operator responds that a signal was present when there was no signal, this is termed a false alarm (FA). If the operator correctly responds when no signal is present, this is termed a correct rejection (CR). If a signal is present and the operator fails to identify it, this is termed a miss (M). In applied psychology and human factors, SDT is applied to research problems including recognition, memory, aptitude testing, and vigilance. Vigilance, referring to the ability of operators to detect infrequent signals over time, is important for human factors across a variety of domains.  Visual Search  A developed area in attention is the control of visual attention - models that attempt to answer, \\"where will an individual look next?\\" A subset of this concerns the question of visual search: How rapidly can a specified object in the visual field be located? This is a common subject of concern for human factors in a variety of domains, with a substantial history in cognitive psychology. This research continues with modern conceptions of salience and salience maps. Human performance modeling techniques in this area include the work of Melloy, Das, Gramopadhye, and Duchowski (2006) regarding Markov models designed to provide upper and lower bound estimates on the time taken by a human operator to scan a homogeneous display. Another example from Witus and Ellis (2003) includes a computational model regarding the detection of ground vehicles in complex images. Facing the nonuniform probability that a menu option is selected by a computer user when certain subsets of the items are highlighted, Fisher, Coury, Tengs, and Duffy (1989) derived an equation for the optimal number of highlighted items for a given number of total items of a given probability distribution. Because visual search is an essential aspect of many tasks, visual search models are now developed in the context of integrating modeling systems. For example, Fleetwood and Byrne (2006) developed an ACT-R model of visual search through a display of labeled icons - predicting the effects of icon quality and set size not only on search time but on eye movements. = Visual Sampling = Many domains contain multiple displays, and require more than a simple discrete yes/no response time measurement. A critical question for these situations may be \\"How much time will operators spend looking at X relative to Y?\\" or \\"What is the likelihood that the operator will completely miss seeing a critical event?\\" Visual sampling is the primary means of obtaining information from the world.Cassavaugh, N. D., Bos, A., McDonald, C., Gunaratne, P., & Backs, R. W. (2013). Assessment of the SEEV Model to Predict Attention Allocation at Intersections During Simulated Driving. In 7th International Driving Symposium on Human Factors in Driver Assessment, Training, and Vehicle Design (No. 52). An early model in this domain is Sender's (1964, 1983) based upon operators monitoring of multiple dials, each with different rates of change.Senders, J. W. (1964). The human operator as a monitor and controller of multidegree of freedom systems. Human Factors in Electronics, IEEE Transactions on, (1), 2-5.Senders, J. W. (1983). Visual sampling processes (Doctoral dissertation, Universiteit van Tilburg). Operators try, as best as they can, to reconstruct the original set of dials based on discrete sampling. This relies on the mathematical Nyquist theorem stating that a signal at W Hz can be reconstructed by sampling every 1/W seconds. This was combined with a measure of the information generation rate for each signal, to predict the optimal sampling rate and dwell time for each dial. Human limitations prevent human performance from matching optimal performance, but the predictive power of the model influenced future work in this area, such as Sheridan's (1970) extension of the model with considerations of access cost and information sample value. A modern conceptualization by Wickens et al. (2008) is the salience, effort, expectancy, and value (SEEV) model. It was developed by the researchers (Wickens et al., 2001) as a model of scanning behavior describing the probability that a given area of interest will attract attention (AOI). The SEEV model is described by p(A) = sS - efEF + (exEX)(vV), in which p(A) is the probability a particular area will be samples, S is the salience for that area; EF represents the effort required in reallocating attention to a new AOI, related to the distance from the currently attended location to the AOI; EX (expectancy) is the expected event rate (bandwidth), and V is the value of the information in that AOI, represented as the product of Relevance and Priority (R*P). The lowercase values are scaling constants. This equation allows for the derivation of optimal and normative models for how an operator should behave, and to characterize how they behave. Wickens et al., (2008) also generated a version of the model that does not require absolute estimation of the free parameters for the environment - just the comparative salience of other regions compared to region of interest. = Visual Discrimination = Models of visual discrimination of individual letters include those of Gibson (1969), Briggs and Hocevar (1975), and McClelland and Rumelhart (1981), the last of which is part of a larger model for word recognition noted for its explanation of the word superiority effect. These models are noted to be highly detailed, and make quantitative predictions about small effects of specific letters. = Depth Perception = A qualitative HPM example includes te Cutting and Vishton (1995) model of depth perception, which indicates that cues to depth perception are more effective at various distances. = Workload = Although an exact definition or method for measurement of the construct of workload is debated by the human factors community, a critical part of the notion is that human operators have some capacity limitations and that such limitations can be exceeded only at the risk of degrading performance. For physical workload, it may be understood that there is a maximum amount that a person should be asked to lift repeatedly, for example. However, the notion of workload becomes more contentious when the capacity to be exceeded is in regard to attention - what are the limits of human attention, and what exactly is meant by attention? Human performance modeling produces valuable insights into this area. Byrne and Pew (2009) consider an example of a basic workload question: \\"To what extent do task A and B interfere?\\" These researchers indicate this as the basis for the psychological refractory period (PRP) paradigm. Participants perform two choice reaction-time tasks, and the two tasks will interfere to a degree - especially when the participant must react to the stimuli for the two tasks when they are close together in time - but the degree of interference is typically smaller than the total time taken for either task. The response selection bottleneck model (Pashler, 1994) models this situation well - in that each task has three components: perception, response selection (cognition), and motor output. The attentional limitation - and thus locus of workload - is that response selection can only be done for one task at a time. The model makes numerous accurate predictions, and those for which it cannot account are addressed by cognitive architectures (Byrne & Anderson, 2001; Meyer & Kieras, 1997). In simple dual-task situations, attention and workload are quantified, and meaningful predictions made possible. Horrey and Wickens (2003) consider the questions: To what extent will a secondary task interfere with driving performance, and does it depend on the nature of the driving and on the interface presented in the second task? Using a model based on multiple resource theory (Wickens, 2002, 2008; Navon & Gopher, 1979), which proposes that there are several loci for multiple-task interference (the stages of processing, the codes of processing, and modalities), the researchers suggest that cross-task interference increases proportional to the extent that the two tasks use the same resources within a given dimension: Visual presentation of a read-back task should interfere more with driving than should auditory presentation, because driving itself makes stronger demands on the visual modality than on the auditory. Although multiple resource theory the best known workload model in human factors, it is often represented qualitatively. The detailed computational implementations are better alternatives for application in HPM methods, to include the Horrey and Wickens (2003) model, which is general enough to be applied in many domains. Integrated approaches, such as task network modeling, are also becoming more prevalent in the literature. Numerical typing is an important perceptual-motor task whose performance may vary with different pacing, finger strategies and urgency of situations. Queuing network-model human processor (QN-MHP), a computational architecture, allows performance of perceptual-motor tasks to be modelled mathematically. The current study enhanced QN-MHP with a top-down control mechanism, a close-loop movement control and a finger-related motor control mechanism to account for task interference, endpoint reduction, and force deficit, respectively. The model also incorporated neuromotor noise theory to quantify endpoint variability in typing. The model predictions of typing speed and accuracy were validated with Lin and Wu's (2011) experimental results. The resultant root-meansquared errors were 3.68% with a correlation of 95.55% for response time, and 35.10% with a correlation of 96.52% for typing accuracy. The model can be applied to provide optimal speech rates for voice synthesis and keyboard designs in different numerical typing situations. The psychological refractory period (PRP) is a basic but important form of dual- task information processing. Existing serial or parallel processing models of PRP have successfully accounted for a variety of PRP phenomena; however, each also encounters at least 1 experimental counterexample to its predictions or modeling mechanisms. This article describes a queuing network-based mathematical model of PRP that is able to model various experimental findings in PRP with closed-form equations including all of the major counterexamples encountered by the existing models with fewer or equal numbers of free parameters. This modeling work also offers an alternative theoretical account for PRP and demonstrates the importance of the theoretical concepts of ‚Äúqueuing‚Äù and ‚Äúhybrid cognitive networks‚Äù in understanding cognitive architecture and multitask performance.  Cognition & Memory  The paradigm shift in psychology from behaviorism to the study of cognition had a huge impact on the field of Human Performance Modeling. Regarding memory and cognition, the research of Newell and Simon regarding artificial intelligence and the General Problem Solver (GPS; Newell & Simon, 1963), demonstrated that computational models could effectively capture fundamental human cognitive behavior. Newell and Simon were not simply concerned with the amount of information - say, counting the number of bits the human cognitive system had to receive from the perceptual system - but rather the actual computations being performed. They were critically involved with the early success of comparing cognition to computation, and the ability of computation to simulate critical aspects of cognition - thus leading to the creation of the sub- discipline of artificial intelligence within computer science, and changing how cognition was viewed in the psychological community. Although cognitive processes do not literally flip bits in the same way that discrete electronic circuits do, pioneers were able to show that any universal computational machine could simulate the processes used in another, without a physical equivalence (Phylyshyn, 1989; Turing, 1936). The cognitive revolution allowed all of cognition to be approached by modeling, and these models now span a vast array of cognitive domains - from simple list memory, to comprehension of communication, to problem solving and decision making, to imagery, and beyond. One popular example is the Atkinson-Shiffrin (1968) \\"modal\\" model of memory. Also, please see Cognitive Models for information not included here.. = Routine Cognitive Skill = One area of memory and cognition regards modeling routine cognitive skills; when an operator has the correct knowledge of how to perform a task and simply needs to execute that knowledge. This is widely applicable, as many operators are practiced enough that their procedures become routine. The GOMS (goals, operators, methods, and selection rules) family of Human Performance Models popularized and well-defined by researchers in the field (Card et al., 1983; John & Kieras, 1996a, 1996b) were originally applied to model users of computer interfaces, but have since been extended to other areas. They are useful HPM tools, suitable for a variety of different concerns and sizes of analysis, but are limited in regard to analyzing user error (see Wood & Kieras, 2002, for an effort to extend GOMS to handling errors). The simplest form of a GOMS model is a keystroke-level model (KLM) - in which all physical actions are listed (e.g., keystrokes, mouse clicks), also termed operations, that a user must take in order to complete a given task. Mental operations (e.g., find an object on the screen) augment this using a straightforward set of rules. Each operations has a time associated with it (such as 280 ms for a keystroke), and the total time for the task is estimated by adding up operation times. The efficiency of two procedures may then be compared, using their respected estimated execution times. Although this form of model is highly approximate (many assumptions are taken at liberty), it is a form of model still used today (e.g., in-vehicle information systems and mobile phones). Detailed versions of GOMS exist, including: CPM-GOMS: \\"Cognitive, perceptual, motor\\"\\" and 'critical path method\\" (John & Kieras, 1996a, 1996b) - attempts to break down performance into primitive CPM units lasting tens to hundreds of milliseconds (durations for many operations in CPM-GOMS models come from published literature, especially Card et al., 1983). GOMSL / NGOMSL: GOMS Language or Natural GOMS Language, which focus on the hierarchical decomposition of goals, but with an analysis including methods - procedures people use to accomplish those goals. Many generic mental operations in the KLM are replaced with detailed descriptions of the cognitive activity involving the organization of people's procedural knowledge into methods. A detailed GOMSL analysis allows for the prediction of not only execution time, but also the time it takes for learning the procedures, and the amount of transfer that can be expected based on already known procedures (Gong and Kieras, 1994). These models are not only useful for informing redesigns of user-interfaces, but also quantitatively predict execution and learning time for multiple tasks. = Decision-Making = Another critical cognitive activity of interest to human factors is that of judgement and decision making. These activities starkly contrast to routine cognitive skills, for which the procedures are known in advance, as many situations require operators to make judgments under uncertaintly - to produce a rating of quality, or perhaps choose among many possible alternatives. Although many disciplines including mathematics and economics make significant contributions to this area of study, the majority of these models do not model human behavior but rather model optimal behavior, such as subjective expected utility theory (Savage, 1954; von Neumann & Morgenstern, 1944). While models of optimal behavior are important and useful, they do not consider a baseline of comparison for human performance - though much research on human decision making in this domain compares human performance to mathematically optimal formulations. Examples of this include Kahneman and Tversky's (1979) prospect theory and Tversky's (1972) elimination by aspects model. Less formal approaches include Tversky and Kahneman's seminal work on heuristics and biases, Gigerenzer's work on 'fast and frugal' shortcuts (Gigerenzer, Todd, & ABC Research Group, 2000), and the descriptive models of Paune, Bettman, and Johnson (1993) on adaptive strategies. Sometimes optimal performance is uncertain, one powerful and popular example is the lens model (Brunswick, 1952; Cooksey, 1996; Hammond, 1955), which deals with policy capturing, cognitive control, and cue utilization, and has been used in aviation (Bisantz & Pritchett, 2003), command and control (Bisantz et al., 2000); to investigate human judgement in employment interviews (Doherty, Ebert, & Callender, 1986), financial analysis (Ebert & Kruse, 1978), physicians' diagnoses (LaDuca, Engel, & Chovan, 1988), teacher ratings (Carkenord & Stephens, 1944), and numerous others. Although the model does have limitations [described in Byrne & Pew (2009)], it is very powerful and remains underutilized in the human factors profession.  Situation Awareness (SA)  Models of SA range from descriptive (Endsley, 1995) to computational (Shively et al., 1997).Shively, R. J., Brickner, M., & Silbiger, J. (1997). A computational model of situational awareness instantiated in MIDAS. Proceedings of the Ninth International Symposium on Aviation Psychology (pp. 1454-1459). Columbus, OH: University of Ohio. The most useful model in HPM is that of McCarley et al. (2002) known as the A-SA model (Attention/Situation Awareness). It incorporates two semi-independent components: a perception/attention module and a cognitive SA-updated module. The P/A model of this A-SA model is based on the Theory of Visual Attention.Bundesen, C. (1990). A theory of visual attention. Psychological Review, 97, 523-547. (Bundesen, 1990) (refer to McCarley et al., 2002).  Integrated Models  Many of these models described are very limited in their application. Although many extensions of SDT have been proposed to cover a variety of other judgement domains (see T.D. Wickens, 2002, for examples), most of these never caught on, and SDT remains limited to binary situations. The narrow scope of these models is not limited to human factors, however - Newton's laws of motion have little predictive power regarding electromagnetism, for example. However, this is frustrating for human factors professionals, because real human performance in vivo draws upon a wide array of human capabilities. As Byrne & Pew (2009) describe, \\"in the space of a minute, a pilot might quite easily conduct a visual search, aim for and push a button, execute a routine procedure, make a multiple-cue probabilistic judgement\\" and do just about everything else described by fundamental human performance models. A fundamental review of HPM by the National Academies (Elkind, Card, Hochberg, & Huey, 1990) described integration as the great unsolved challenge in HPM. This issue remains to be solved, however, there have been efforts to integrate and unify multiple models and build systems that span across domains. In human factors, the two primary modeling approaches that accomplish this and have gained popularity are task network modeling and cognitive architectures. = Task Network Modeling = The term network model refers to a modeling procedure involving Monte Carlo simulation rather than to a specific model. Although the modeling framework is atheoretical, the quality of the models that are built with it are only as high of a quality as the theories and data used to create them. When a modeler builds a network model of a task, the first step is to construct a flow chart decomposing the task into discrete sub-tasks - each sub-task as a node, the serial and parallel paths connecting them, and the gating logic that governs the sequential flow through the resulting network. When modeling human-system performance, some nodes represent human decision processes and.or human task execution, some represent system execution sub- tasks, and some aggregate human/machine performance into a single node. Each node is represented by a statistically specified completion time distribution and a probability of completion. When all these specifications are programmed into a computer, the network is exercised repeatedly in Monte Carlo fashion to build up distributions of the aggregate performance measures that are of concern to the analyst. The art in this is in the modeler's selection of the right level of abstraction at which to represent nodes and paths and in estimating the statistically defined parameters for each node. Sometimes, human-in-the-loop simulations are conducted to provide support and validation for the estimates.. Detail regarding this, related, and alternative approaches may be found in Laughery, Lebiere, and Archer (2006) and in the work of Schwieckert and colleagues, such as Schweickert, Fisher, and Proctor (2003). Historically, Task Network Modeling stems from queuing theory and modeling of engineering reliability and quality control. Art Siegel, a psychologist, first though of extending reliability methods into a Monte Carlo simulation model of human-machine performance (Siegel & Wolf, 1969). In the early 1970s, the U.S. Air Force sponsored the development of SAINT (Systems Analysis of Integrated Networks of Tasks), a high-level programming language specifically designed to support the programming of Monte Carlo simulations of human-machine task networks (Wortman, Pritsker, Seum, Seifert, & Chubb, 1974). A modern version of this software is Micro Saint Sharp (Archer, Headley, & Allender, 2003). This family of software spawned a tree of special-purpose programs with varying degrees of commonality and specificity with Micro Saint. The most prominent of these is the IMPRINT series (Improved Performance Research Integration Tool)Samms, C. (2010, September). Improved Performance Research Integration Tool (IMPRINT): Human Performance Modeling for Improved System Design. InProceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting(Vol. 54, No. 7, pp. 624-625). SAGE Publications. sponsored by the U.S. Army (and based on MANPRINT) which provides modeling templates specifically adapted to particular human performance modeling applications (Archer et al., 2003). Two workload-specific programs are W/INDEX (North & Riley, 1989) and WinCrew (Lockett, 1997). The network approach to modeling using these programs is popular due to its technical accessibility to individual with general knowledge of computer simulation techniques and human performance analysis. The flowcharts that result from task analysis lead naturally to formal network models. The models can be developed to serve specific purposes - from simulation of an individual using a human-computer interface to analyzing potential traffic flow in a hospital emergency center. Their weakness is the great difficulty required to derive performance times and success probabilities from previous data or from theory or first principles. These data provide the model's principle content. = Cognitive Architectures = Cognitive Architectures are broad theories of human cognition based on a wide selection of human empirical data and are generally implemented as computer simulations. They are the embodiment of a scientific hypothesis about those aspects of human cognition relatively constant over time and independent of task (Gray, Young, & Kirschenbaum, 1997; Ritter & young, 2001). Cognitive architectures are an attempt to theoretically unify disconnected empirical phenomena in the form of computer simulation models. While theory is inadequate for the application of human factors, since the 1990s cognitive architectures also include mechanisms for sensation, perception, and action. Two early examples of this include the Executive Process Interactive Control model (EPIC; Kieras, Wood, & Meyer, 1995; Meyer & Kieras, 1997) and the ACT-R (Byrne & Anderson, 1998). A model of a task in a cognitive architecture, generally referred to as a cognitive model, consists of both the architecture and the knowledge to perform the task. This knowledge is acquired through human factors methods including task analyses of the activity being modeled. Cognitive architectures are also connected with a complex simulation of the environment in which the task is to be performed - sometimes, the architecture interacts directly with the actual software humans use to perform the task. Cognitive architectures not only produce a prediction about performance, but also output actual performance data - able to produce time-stamped sequences of actions that can be compared with real human performance on a task. Examples of cognitive architectures include the EPIC system (Hornof & Kieras, 1997, 1999), CPM-GOMS (Kieras, Wood, & Meyer, 1997), the Queuing Network-Model Human Processor (Wu & Liu, 2007, 2008),, ACT-R (Anderson, 2007; Anderson & Lebiere, 1998), and QN-ACTR (Cao & Liu, 2013). The Queuing Network-Model Human Processor model was used to predict how drivers perceive the operating speed and posted speed limit, make choice of speed, and execute the decided operating speed. The model was sensitive (average d‚Äô was 2.1) and accurate (average testing accuracy was over 86%) to predict the majority of unintentional speeding ACT-R has been used to model a wide variety of phenomena. It consists of several modules, each one modeling a different aspect of the human system. Modules are associated with specific brain regions, and the ACT-R has thus successfully predicted neural activity in parts of those regions. Each model essentially represents a theory of how that piece of the overall system works - derived from research literature in the area. For example, the declarative memory system in ACT-R is based on series of equations considering frequency and recency and that incorporate Baysean notions of need probability given context, also incorporating equations for learning as well as performance, Some modules are of higher fidelity than others, however - the manual module incorporates Fitt's law and other simple operating principles, but is not as detailed as the optimal control theory model (as of yet). The notion, however, is that each of these modules require strong empirical validation. This is both a benefit and a limitation to the ACT-R, as there is still much work to be done in the integration of cognitive, perceptual, and motor components, but this process is promising (Byrne, 2007; Foyle and Hooey, 2008; Pew & Mavor, 1998).  Group Behavior  = Team/Crew Performance Modeling = GOMS has been used to model both complex team tasks (Kieras & Santoro, 2004) and group decision making (Sorkin, Hays, & West, 2001).  Modeling Approaches  Computer Simulation Models/Approaches Example: IMPRINT (Improved Performance Research Integration Tool) Mathematical Models/Approaches Example: Cognitive model Comparing HPM Models To compare different HPM models, one of ways is to calculate their AIC (Akaike information criterion) and consider the Cross-validation criterion.Busemeyer, J. R. (2000) Model Comparisons and Model Selections Based on Generalization Criterion Methodology, Journal of Mathematical Psychology 44, 171-189  Benefits  Numerous benefits may be gained from using modeling techniques in the human performance domain.  Specificity  A sizable majority of explanations in psychology are not only qualitative but also vague. Concepts such as \\"attention\\", \\"processing capacity\\", \\"workload\\", and \\"situation awareness\\" (SA), both general and specific to human factors, are often difficult to quantify in applied domains. Researchers differ in their definitions of such terms, which makes it likewise difficult to specify data for each term. Formal models, in contrast, typically require explicit specification of theoretical terms. Specificity requires that explanations be internally coherent; while verbal theories are often so flexible that they fail to remain consistent, allowing contradictory predictions to be derived from their use. Not all models are quantitative in nature, however, and thus not all provide the benefit of specificity to the same degree.  Objectivity  Formal models are generally modeler independent. Although great skill is involved in constructing a specific model, once it is constructed, anybody with the appropriate knowledge can run it or solve it, and the model produces the same predictions regardless of who is running or solving the model. Predictions are no longer leashed to the biases or sole intuition of a single expert but, rather, to a specification that can be made public.  Quantitativeness  Many human performance models make quantitative predictions, which are critical in applied situations. Purely empirical methods analyzed with hypothesis testing techniques, as standard in most psychological experiments, focus on providing answers to vague questions such as \\"Are A and B different?\\" and then \\"Is this difference statistically significant?\\"; while formal models often provide useful quantitative information such as \\"A is x% slower than B.\\"  Clarity  Human performance models provide clarity, in that the model provides an explanation for observed differences; such explanations are not generally provided by strictly empirical methods.  Issues   Misconceptions  Many human performance models share key features with Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods and systems. The function of AI research is to produce systems that exhibit intelligent behavior, generally without consideration of the degree to which that intelligence resembles or predicts human performance, yet the distinction between AI methods and that of HPM is at times unclear. For example, Bayesian classifiers used to filter spam emails approximate human classification performance (classifying spam emails as spam, and non-spam emails as importation) and are thus highly intelligence systems, but fail to rely on interpretation of the semantics of the messages themselves; instead relying on statistical methods. However, Bayesian analysis can also be essential to human performance models.  Usefulness  Models may focus more on the processes involved in human performance rather than the products of human performance, thus limiting their usefulness in human factors practice.  Abstraction  The abstraction necessary for understandable models competes with accuracy. While generality, simplicity, and understandability are important to the application of models in human factors practice, many valuable human performance models are inaccessible to those without graduate, or postdoctoral training. For example, while Fitts's law is straightforward for even undergraduates, the lens model requires an intimate understanding of multiple regression, and construction of an ACT-R type model requires extensive programming skills and years of experience. While the successes of complex models are considerable, a practitioner of HPM must be aware of the trade-offs between accuracy and usability.  Free Parameters  As is the case in most model-based sciences, free parameters rampant within models of human performance also require empirical data a priori. There may be limitations in regard to collecting the empirical data necessary to run a given model, which may constrains the application of that given model.  Validation  Validation of human performance models is of the highest concern to the science of HPM. Usually researchers using R square and Root Mean Square (RMS) between the experimental data and the model's prediction. In addition, while validity may be assessed with comparison between human data and the model's output, free parameters are flexible to incorrectly fit data.  Common Terms  -Free Parameter: The parameters of a model whose values are estimated from the data to be modeled to maximally align the model's prediction.Computational Modeling in Cognition: Principles and Practice (2010) by Stephan Lewandowsky and Simon Farrell -Coefficient of determination (R Square): A line or curve indicate how well the data fit a statistic model. -Root Mean Square (RMS): A statistical measure defined as the square root of the arithmetic mean of the squares of a set of numbers.

Lilienfeld (December 23, 1960 ‚Äì September 30, 2020) was a professor of psychology at Emory University and advocate for evidence-based treatments and methods within the field. He is known for his books 50 Great Myths of Popular Psychology, Brainwashed, and others that explore and sometimes debunk psychological claims that appear in the popular press. Along with having his work featured in major U.S. newspapers and journals such as The New York Times, The New Yorker, and Scientific American, Lilienfeld has made television appearances on 20/20, CNN and the CBS Evening News. Background Lilienfeld was born on December 23, 1960 to Ralph and Thelma Lilienfeld of New York, N.Y.(in the Borough of Queens). Growing up, he was interested in paleontology and astronomy, but decided to study psychology after a high school course, then later a few college courses, piqued his interest. He has stated: \\"Although my love for natural science never waned, I eventually fell in love with the mysteries of the internal world ‚Äî the human mind ‚Äî even more than those of the external world.\\" Lilienfeld studied psychology at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1982. As an undergraduate, he was influenced by the work of David T. Lykken on psychopathic personality. Over time, he developed an interest in personality disorders, dissociative disorders, personality assessment, anxiety disorders, psychiatric classification, pseudoscience in psychology, and evidence-based practices in clinical psychology. Lilienfeld considers himself a generalist, saying \\"this breadth makes me a better researcher and thinker\\" with a broad perspective on the field of psychology. In 1986, he began a clinical internship at Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which he completed in 1987. He earned a doctorate in clinical psychology from the University of Minnesota in 1990. From 1990 to 1994, Lilienfeld was an assistant professor of psychology at State University of New York in Albany, NY. From there, he moved to Emory University and served as associate professor until he earned full professorship in 2000. In 2002, Lilienfeld founded the Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice. He was also a consulting editor for Skeptical Inquirer and Skeptic Magazine. He participated on the editorial boards of the Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine, Journal of Abnormal Psychology, Psychological Assessment, Perspectives on Psychological Science and Clinical Psychology Review, and wrote articles for Scientific American Mind and Psychology Today. Lilienfeld was a professor of psychology at Emory University, Atlanta, GA. Lilienfeld died of pancreatic cancer at age 60, at his home in Atlanta, on September 30, 2020. Career Conspiracy Panel at CSICon (Left to right: Ted Goertzel, Dave Thomas, Bob Blaskiewicz, and Scott O. Lilienfeld) Lilienfeld, along with his colleague Sally Satel, has dedicated much of his career in psychology to debunking \\"the pop neuroscience that keeps making headlines\\". They target such practices as functional magnetic resonance imaging (or neuroimaging) to \\"detect\\" moral and spiritual centers of the brain, which they call \\"oversimplified neurononsense\\". Their book Brainwashed: The Seductive Appeal of Mindless Neuroscience was a finalist in the Los Angeles Times Book Prize in Science in 2013. He has stated: > I predict, or at least hope, that the field [of psychology] will move to a > more mature and nuanced understanding of the proper role of neuroscience in > psychology. This will necessitate understanding that neuroscience can offer > valuable insights for certain psychological questions but that different > levels of analysis are more fruitful than neuroscience for other questions. Lilienfeld has written critically about eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), the use of the Rorschach test to make psychological diagnosis, recovered memory therapy, and misconceptions in autism research, such as the MMR vaccine controversy, noting that \\"multiple controlled studies conducted on huge international scales have debunked any statistical association between the MMR vaccine and autism\\", and fad treatments such as facilitated communication. During a James Randi Educational Foundation panel at the 2014 Amaz!ng Meeting, Lilienfeld was asked if he thought rationality could be taught. He responded that rationality and critical thinking are not natural to the human species and to some degree it can be taught, but added that they are very domain specific and may not generalise to other areas; a person can be completely rational in one area and very irrational in others. He said \\"I see science in many ways as a set of safeguards against confirmation bias\\", and that, while the structure of general science and the scientific community work to reduce confirmation bias, individual scientists are not generally as susceptible to confirmation bias as other people are. Therefore, he said, \\"It's up to the scientific community ... to hold their feet to the fire and make sure that their confirmation bias does not get in the way of their corroborating their own hypotheses.\\" 50 Great Myths of Popular Psychology In his book, 50 Great Myths of Popular Psychology: Shattering Widespread Misconceptions about Human Behavior, written with Steven Jay Lynn, John Ruscio and Barry Beyerstein, Lilienfeld examines 50 common myths about psychology and provides readers with a \\"myth busting kit\\" to help learn critical thinking skills and understand sources of psychological myths, such as word of mouth, inferring causation from correlation, and misleading film and media portrayals. Lilienfeld argues that there is a large and growing difference between traditional psychology and \\"pop psychology\\", and that personal experiences, intuition and common sense fuel pop psychology and are compelling and powerful, but are also \\"limiting when testing theories... about the brain\\". He states that hundreds of self-help books are published every year because people want \\"quick, easy solutions\\" to their problems. The book includes such topics as the percent of brain power people use, the use of products such as Baby Einstein in child development, subliminal messaging in advertising, the use of hypnosis for memory retrieval, and symbolism in dreams. The 50 myths selected for the book were chosen based on personal experiences by the authors, a publisher survey of dozens of psychology professors who identified commonplace myths among their students, and myths that are \\"deeply embedded in popular culture\\", like the polygraph test and the Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus myth. The book's appendix includes \\"recommended websites for exploring psychomythology.\\" Though Lilienfeld understands that books like the 50 Great Myths will do little to fix people's credulity when it comes to popular myths, he is hopeful that maybe these books will have a 1% effect on changing minds. Skepticism Scott Lilienfeld speaks about confirmation bias at the European Skeptics Congress 2017. Lilienfeld wrote and spoke about the need for better communication between skeptic groups, which can be insular, and the general public. He pointed out that, to debunk a myth, people need some other information to replace it, and that this is an idea skeptics have not always understood. He suggested that \\"skeptics should become more outspoken\\" when myths are presented as facts in the media. Instead of ignoring misinformation and thinking \\"I'm just one voice, what kind of impact can I have?\\", Lilienfeld supported the idea of empowering people to speak out in their area of expertise. \\"If everyone spoke out in their field of expertise and wrote to newspapers and television stations, we would eventually have an effect.\\" Lilienfeld cautioned that the skeptical community needs to insist on evidence, but always keep an open mind that a claim could possibly be true. Lilienfeld taught his students what he calls the \\"potential warning signs of pseudoscience\\". Most pseudosciences, Lilienfeld says: > tend to focus more on confirming than on refuting hypotheses, casually > invoke ad hoc hypotheses (escape hatches) as a means of immunizing their > claims from falsification, lack the self-correcting character of mature > sciences, make exaggerated claims that greatly outstrip the evidence, try to > evade peer review, insist that only insiders are qualified to evaluate their > claims, claim to invent entirely new paradigms out of whole cloth, and so > on.

The son of Mark and Deborah Jones, he was born in Fogo and was educated there and at Memorial University. From 1930 to 1940, he taught school at Seldom Come By, Bay St. George and Bay of Islands. He was principal of the International Grenfell Association boarding school in Cartwright, Labrador. From 1940 to 1944, he was field secretary of the Canadian Legion educational service in Newfoundland. In 1944, he was named magistrate at Harbour Breton and, in 1955, at Grand Bank. In 1956, he was named to the South Coast Commission. Jones married Nina Smith; the couple had four children. He was elected to the Newfoundland assembly in 1956 and was reelected in 1959, 1962 and was elected for Fogo in 1966. He served in the Newfoundland cabinet as Minister of Highways and then as Minister of Finance. He resigned from politics in October 1971, when he was named chair of the Newfoundland Civil Service commission. He died in St. John's at the age of 67.

Behind the draper‚Äôs shop was a hall in which Mr Fuller organized free public entertainment on Sunday afternoons, having his daughters recite, sing and play various instruments ‚Äì the eldest girl learned the harp, for instance. Rosalind, who was called Ivy by her family until she was 21, when she opted for her first given name, always disliked having to perform on stage because she suffered agonies of self- consciousness.Winnington p.4 Having incautiously underwritten a friend‚Äôs research, Mr Fuller was made bankrupt in 1908, and Walter (who was editing periodicals in London) became financially responsible for the family. He had always encouraged his eldest sister to collect and learn folksongs; in 1911, she and Rosalind visited Cecil Sharp, the great collector of folksongs, and sang him some. He was entranced and immediately had them demonstrate for him, first at the Festival of Empire and then at the Stratford-upon-Avon Summer School of Folksong and Dance.Musical Times, 1 October 1911, p.654. Visiting Americans exclaimed how charming they sounded, and they formed a project of going to the United States to perform over there.Winnington p.61 Singer Cynthia, Dorothy and Rosalind Fuller Walter embraced the idea of making their fortunes in the New World. With him as their musical director, impresario, and chaperone, the three older sisters ‚Äì including Rosalind, then ‚Äì arrived in New York at Christmas 1911, with enough money for three weeks in a hotel. They would have to make enough money by singing to pay for their return ticket. They were an instant success; within six months they were invited to sing at the White House, but left for home before they could fit the President into their busy schedule. At this point, the eldest sister (who had studied the harp and singing at the Royal College of Music) got married and was replaced by the youngest. As The Fuller Sisters they continued making immensely successful tours, with Rosalind their most bewitching performer. President Woodrow Wilson invited them to sing for him on two occasions, once at the White HouseWinnington p.90 and once at his summer residence.Winnington p.195. Their career ended when the entry of the US into World War I wiped out the demand for folksongs. During these tours, they continued to collect folksongs, and Rosalind alerted Cecil Sharp to the work of Olive Dame Campbell; he immediately undertook the research on which half of his reputation is founded.David E. Whisnant, All that is Native and Fine: the Politics of Culture in an American Region. University of North Carolina Press, 1995. p.113 After Walter married Crystal Eastman, the great socialist feminist, Rosalind (who had embraced a philosophy of free love long before she knew what this actually implied) had sex with Crystal‚Äôs brother Max. Shortly after, she slept with Walter's friend Norman Angell. She maintained intimate relations with both men for many years. Back in England after World War I, Rosalind decided that she wanted to go on the stage, and signed on as a chorus girl with a Paris troupe that she had never previously heard of, the Folies Berg√®re. Eight months later, she sailed for New York, having decided to try her chance as an actress there. Within weeks, she met the as yet unknown writer F. Scott Fitzgerald; he had just handed in the MS of The Other Side of Paradise (1920) to Scribner‚Äôs. During their affair, she inspired him with a short story (published as Head and Shoulders) which his agent sold to the Saturday Evening Post for $300 and then the film rights to it for $2500. This money enabled him to marry Zelda, who had put their engagement on hold until he earned some money.Winnington pp. 278‚Äì79. Actress Rosalind‚Äôs acting career began in 1920 (What's in a Name), soon followed by the role of Ophelia to John Barrymore's Hamlet on Broadway in 1922 ‚Äì the most famous production of Hamlet yet. After many other stage appearances, some with the Provincetown Players, she and her partner, the photographer Francis Brugui√®re, moved to London in 1927. At this point, she took the opportunity to drop nine years off her age, which is why many sources erroneously give her birth year as 1901.Kissing the Joy passim. She also added an \\"e\\" at the end of her forename for professional reasons. She had a busy stage career in Britain, starting with The Squall (1927) and The Unknown Warrior (1928). Over the following thirty years, she appeared in about sixty different stage plays and acted in at least a dozen radio plays. In the mid-1950s, she launched her own solo show of monodramas which she adapted from short stories. During the 1960s she performed these throughout the world under the auspices of the British Council. She continued to act until the late 1970s. Between 1929 and 1935, she appeared in seven films, most notably Escape Me Never, and in at least four tv dramas between 1939 and 1949, including Britain's first live broadcast television play, Rehearsal for a Drama (1939).Kissing the Joy passim. In the University of Bristol Theatre Collection there is a portrait of Rosalind as she appeared in The Marble Heart, painted by Max Chapman (1911‚Äì1999).

Snyder, M. Matthews, (eds). 1992. Mars. University of Arizona Press. Tucson. However, over the decades, as more parts of the planet were imaged with better cameras on more sophisticated satellites, Mars showed evidence of past river valleys, lakes and present ice in glaciers and in the ground. It was discovered that the climate of Mars displays huge changes over geologic time because its axis is not stabilized by a large moon, as Earth's is.Madeleine, J. et al. 2007.

Heated Lakes on Mars. In Cabrol, N. and E. Grin (eds.). 2010. Lakes on Mars. Elsevier. NY. This article describes some of the places that could have held large lakes. Overview Besides seeing features that were signs of past surface water, researchers found other types of evidence for past water. Minerals detected in many locations needed water to form.Murchie, S., et al. 2008. First results from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM), LPSC XXXIX abstract 1472.Zolotov, M., M. Mironenko. 2008.

Lakes on Mars. Elsevier. NY An instrument in 2001 Mars Odyssey orbiter mapped the distribution of water in the shallow surface. When the Phoenix lander fired its retrorockets to land in the far north, ice was exposed. When water enters a large body of water, such as a lake, a delta may form. Many craters and other depressions on Mars show deltas that resemble those on Earth. In addition, if a lake lies in a depression, channels entering it will all stop at the same altitude. Such an arrangement is visible around places on Mars that are supposed to have contained large bodies of water, including around a possible ocean in the north. Lake formation in the past has been suspected by various researchers for quite some time. One study found 205 possible closed- basin lakes in craters on Mars. The basins have an inlet valley that cuts the crater rim and flows into the basin, but they have no visible outlet valley. The total volume of the basins is equivalent to a depth of 1.2 meters spread evenly over the Martian surface. However, this amount is a small fraction of the current water ice stores on Mars. Another study found 210 open-basin lakes. These were lakes with both an inlet and an outlet; hence water must have entered the basin, and reached the height of the outlet. Some of these lakes had volumes similar to Earth's Caspian Sea, Black Sea, and Lake Baikal. A study presented at the 2018 Lunar and Planetary Science Conference found 64 paleolakes in the northwest Hellas region. The team suggested that these lakes formed from an ocean that occupied the Hellas basin and southeast lowland. CRISM data for the region showed aqueous minerals such as Fe/Mg smectites, anhydrous chloride, and probably carbonates.Zhao, J., et al. 2018. PALEOLAKES IN THE NORTHWEST HELLAS REGION: IMPLICATIONS FOR PALEO-CLIMATE AND REGIONAL GEOLOGIC HISTORY. 49th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference 2018 (LPI Contrib. No. 2083). Such an ocean was suggested by a team of researchers in 2016.Salese F. et al. (2016) JGR, 120, 2555‚Äì2570. Forty-eight possible extinct lakes were found in Arabia Terra. Some were classified as open-basin systems because they showed evidence for an outlet channel. These lakes ranged from tens of meters to tens of kilometers in size. Many of these lakes were discovered by looking for inverted reliefs.Davis, J., et al. 2018. INVERTED PALAEOLAKES IN ARABIA TERRA, MARS: EVIDENCE FOR FLUCTUATING EROSION AND DEPOSTION IN THE NOACHIAN. 49th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference 2018 (LPI Contrib. No. 2083). 1902 In a study released in 2018, researchers found 34 paleolakes and associated channels in the northeastern Hellas Basin. Some were close to the Hadriacus volcano. Dikes from the volcano could have created hydrothermal systems, thereby allowing ice to melt. Some appeared to have formed from precipitation, others from groundwater. Moreover, some basins on Mars form part of long chains of lakes. The Naktong/Scamander/Mamers Valles lake-chain system is about 4500 km (2800 miles) long, with a drainage area similar to that of the Missouri-Mississippi rivers. Another, the Samara/Himera Vallis system, is 1800 km long. Many of the long chains of lakes are found in the Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle. Some of the lakes appear to have had a high volume as compared to their drainage area; hence, it is thought that some of the water was groundwater. Further evidence is the existence of knobby material on the basin floors. These knobs could have been formed when large amounts of water left the ground.Head, J., S. Pratt. 2001. Closed chaos basins on Mars: Evidence for regional groundwater drawdown and collapse. Lunar Planet. Sci. XXXII. Abstract 1774. In February 2019, a group of European scientists published geological evidence of an ancient planet-wide groundwater system that was probably connected to a Martian ocean. The study was of 24 craters that did not display an inlet or outlet; hence, water for the lake would have come from the ground. All craters were located in the northern hemisphere of Mars. These craters had floors lying roughly 4000 m below Martian 'sea level' (a level that, given the planet's lack of seas, is defined based on elevation and atmospheric pressure). Features on the floors of these craters could only have formed in the presence of water. Many craters contain multiple features showing that the water level in the craters rose and fell over time. Deltas and terraces were present in some craters.http://astrobiology.com/2019/02/first-evidence-of-a-planet-wide- groundwater-system-on-mars.html Minerals such as various clays and light-toned minerals that form in water are found on some of the crater floors. Also, layers are found in some of these craters. Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that water was present in these places. Some of the craters studied were Pettit, Sagan, Nicholson, Mclaughlin, du Martheray, Tombaugh, Mojave, Curie, Oyama, and Wahoo. It seems that if a crater was deep enough, water came out of the ground and produced a lake.

The Mars ocean hypothesis postulates that nearly a third of the surface of Mars was covered by an ocean of liquid water early in the planet's geologic history.Cabrol, N. and E. Grin (eds.). 2010. Lakes on Mars. Elsevier. NY This primordial ocean, dubbed paleo-ocean and Oceanus Borealis, would have filled the Vastitas Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere, a region which lies 4‚Äì5 km (2.5‚Äì3 miles) below the mean planetary elevation, about 3.8 billion years ago. Evidence for this ocean includes geographic features resembling ancient shorelines, and the chemical properties of the Martian soil and atmosphere. However, for such an ocean to have existed, early Mars would have required a magnetosphere, a denser atmosphere, and warmer climate to allow liquid water to remain at the surface.Read, Peter L. and S. R. Lewis, \\"The Martian Climate Revisited: Atmosphere and Environment of a Desert Planet\\", Praxis, Chichester, UK, 2004. Observational evidence Features first shown by the Viking orbiters in 1976 revealed two possible ancient shorelines near the pole, Arabia and Deuteronilus, each thousands of kilometers long. Several physical features in the present geography of Mars suggest the past existence of a primordial ocean. Networks of gullies that merge into larger channels imply erosion by a liquid flow and resemble ancient riverbeds on Earth. Enormous channels, 25 km wide and several hundred meters deep, appear to have flowed directly from underground aquifers in the Southern uplands into the Northern plains. Much of the northern hemisphere of Mars is at a significantly lower elevation than the rest of the planet (the Martian dichotomy), and is unusually flat. The low elevation would cause water, if it existed, to gather there. An ocean would tend to level out the ground underneath it. The acceptance of a vast northern ocean has waxed and waned over the decades. Beginning in 1998, scientists Michael Malin and Kenneth Edgett set out to investigate, using cameras on board the Mars Global Surveyor with a resolution five to ten times better than those of the Viking orbiter, in places that would test shorelines proposed by others in the scientific literature. Their analysis was inconclusive at best, and reported that the shoreline varies in elevation by several kilometers, rising and falling from one peak to the next for thousands of miles. This report cast doubt on whether the features truly mark a long-gone sea coast, and has been taken as an argument against the Martian shoreline (and ocean) hypothesis. Research published in 2009 shows a much higher density of stream channels than formerly estimated. Regions on Mars with the most valleys are comparable to what is found on Earth. The research team developed a computer program to identify valleys by searching in topographical data for U-shaped structures. The large extent of valley networks found strongly supports rain on the planet in the past. The global pattern of the Martian valleys could be explained by an extensive northern ocean. A large ocean in the northern hemisphere would explain why there is a southern limit to valley networks: the southernmost regions of Mars, farthest from the water reservoir, would get little rainfall and would develop no valleys. Similarly, the lack of rainfall would explain why Martian valleys become shallower from north to south. A 2010 study of river deltas on Mars revealed that seventeen of them are found at the altitude of a proposed shoreline for a Martian ocean. This is what would be expected if the deltas were all next to a large body of water. Research published in 2012 using data from MARSIS, a radar on board the Mars Express orbiter, supports the hypothesis of a former large northern ocean. The instrument revealed a dielectric constant of the surface similar to those of low-density sedimentary deposits, massive deposits of ground-ice, or a combination of the two. The measurements were not like those of a lava-rich surface. In March 2015, scientists stated that evidence exists for an ancient volume of water that could comprise an ocean, likely in the planet's northern hemisphere and about the size of Earth's Arctic Ocean. This finding was derived from the ratio of water and deuterium in the modern Martian atmosphere compared to the ratio found on Earth and derived from telescopic observations. Eight times as much deuterium was inferred at the polar deposits of Mars than exists on Earth (VSMOW), suggesting that ancient Mars had significantly higher levels of water. The representative atmospheric value obtained from the maps (7 VSMOW) is not affected by climatological effects as those measured by localized rovers, although the telescopic measurements are within range to the enrichment measured by the Curiosity rover in Gale Crater of 5‚Äì7 VSMOW.  Valles Marineris canyon system  Valles Marineris is the largest canyon system in the Solar System, and much evidence suggests that all or parts of the canyon system contained lakes. It is located in the Coprates quadrangle. The walls of the canyons often contain many layers. The floors of some of the canyons contain large deposits of layered materials. Some researchers think that the layers were formed when water once filled the canyons.McCauley, J. 1978. Geologic map of the Coprates quadrangle of Mars. U.S. Geol. Misc. Inv. Map I-897Weitz, C. and T. Parker. 2000. New evidence that the Valles Marineris interior deposits formed in standing bodies of water. LPSC XXXI. Abstract 1693 Layered deposits, called interior layered deposits (ILDs), in various parts of Valles Marineris, especially Candor Chasma and Juventae Chasma, have led many researchers to suspect that they were formed when the whole area was a giant lake. However, many other ideas have been advanced to attempt to explain them.Cabrol, N. and E. Grin (Eds.). 2010. Lakes on Mars. Elsevier. NY High- resolution structural and geologic mapping in west Candor Chasma, presented in March 2015, showed that the deposits on the floor of the Candor Chasma are basin-filling sediments that were deposited in a wet playa-like setting; hence water was involved in their formation.Okubo, C. 2015. HIGH-RESOLUTION STRUCTURAL AND GEOLOGIC MAPPING IN CANDOR CHASMA. 46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. 1210.pdf Minerals that generally require water for their formation have been found in ILDs, thus supporting water in the system. The European Space Agency's Mars Express found possible evidence for the sulfates epsomite and kieserite, minerals that form in water. Ferric oxide in the form of crystalline grey hematite, which typically requires water for its formation, was also detected. Although there is much controversy about a lake in the whole of Valles Marineris, a fairly strong case can be made for smaller lakes. Melas Chasma is thought to have once contained a lake, as it is the deepest part of the Valles Marineris system at 11 km (7 miles) below the surrounding surface. From here to the outflow channels there is about a 0.03-degree slope upward to the northern plains, which means that if the canyon was filled with liquid, there would be a lake 1 km deep before the fluid would flow out onto the northern plains. Melas Chasma is the widest segment of the Valles Marineris canyon system, located east of Ius Chasma at 9.8¬∞S, 283.6¬∞E in Coprates quadrangle. It cuts through layered deposits that are thought to be sediments from an old lake that resulted from runoff of the valley networks to the west. Support for abundant past water in Melas Chasma comes from the discovery by MRO of hydrated sulfates that need water for their formation.Murchie, S. et al. 2009. A synthesis of Martian aqueous mineralogy after 1 Mars year of observations from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Journal of Geophysical Research 114. Moreover, in a 2015 study of southwestern Melas Chasma, using high-resolution image, topographic and spectral datasets, eleven fan-shaped landforms were found. These fans add to growing evidence that Melas Chasma once held a lake which fluctuated in level.Davis, J., P. Grindrod, R. Williams, S. Gupta, M. Balme. 2015. STRATIGRAPHIC EVIDENCE OF EPISODIC FLUVIAL ACTIVITY IN THE SOUTH MELAS CHASMA BASIN, VALLES MARINERIS, MARS. 46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. 1932.pdf A lake could have formed in the southwest part of Melas Chasma from runoff from local valley networks.Quantin, et al. 2005.Metx, et al. 2009.

It would have had an average depth of only 842 m‚Äîmuch shallower than the 5‚Äì10 km depth of parts of Valles Marineris. Still, its volume of 110,000 km3 would be comparable to Earth's Caspian Sea. The main evidence for such a lake is the presence of benches at the level that models show is where the lake level should be. Also, the low point in Eos Chasma where water would be expected to overflow is marked by fluvial features. The features look as if the flow came together in a small area and caused significant erosion.Harrison, K., M. Chapman. 2010.

(23,000 ft) below the standard topographic datum of Mars. The basin is located in the southern highlands of Mars and is thought to have been formed about 3.9 billion years ago, during the Late Heavy Bombardment. It is thought that a large lake existed in the Hellas Basin early in the planet's history with a possible depth of 5.5 km.Cabrol, N. and E. Grin (eds.). 2010. Lakes on Mars. Elsevier.

DISTRIBUTION AND EVOLUTION OF LACUSTRINE AND FLUVIAL FEATURES IN HELLAS PLANITIA, MARS, BASED ON PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF GRID-MAPPING. 47th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2016) 1228.pdf. Possible shorelines have been discovered. These shorelines are evident in alternating benches and scarps visible in Mars orbiting camera narrow-angle images. A good example of layers that were deposited in Hellas, and later exposed by erosion, is visible in Terby Crater on the north rim of Hellas. It used to be thought that Terby Crater contained a large delta.Ansan, V. et al. 2005. Analysis of layered deposits in Terby crater Hellas region, Mars using multiple datasets MOC, THEMIS, and OMEGA/MEX date. Lunar Planet. Sci., XXXVI (CD-ROM). Abstract 1324. However, later observations have led researchers to think of the layered sequence as part of a group of layers that may have extended all the across Hellas. There is no valley at the northern rim of Terby large enough to have carried the large amount of sediments necessary to produce the layers. Other observations argue against Terby containing a delta. In addition, Mars orbiting laser altimeter (MOLA) data show that the contacts of these sedimentary units mark contours of constant elevation for thousands of km, and in one case all around the basin.Wilson, S., et al. 2010. Evidence for ancient lakes in the Hellas region. In Cabrol, N. and E. Grin (eds.). 2010. Lakes on Mars. Elsevier. NY.

Channels, thought to be formed by water, enter the basin on all sides.Greeley, R., J. Guest. 1987. Geologic map of the eastern equatorial region of Mars.

Click on image to see relationship of Dao Vallis to other nearby features, especially channels. Dao Vallis begins near a large volcano, called Hadriaca Patera, so it is thought to have received water when hot magma melted huge amounts of ice in the frozen ground. The partially circular depressions on the left side of the channel in the adjacent image suggest that groundwater sapping also contributed water. The Hellas drainage basin may be almost one-fifth the area of the entire northern plains. A lake in Hellas in today's Martian climate would form thick ice at the top that would eventually be removed by sublimation: the ice would turn directly from solid state to gas, as dry ice (solid CO2) does on Earth. Glacial features (terminal moraines, drumlins, and eskers) have been found that may have been formed when the water froze. A lake filling the Hellas Basin may have lasted a very long time, particularly if there were some geothermal sources of heat. Consequently, microbial life may have had time to develop there.

It is the deepest crater on Mars and has the highest surface pressure: 1155 Pa (11.55 mbar, 0.17 psi, or 0.01 atm). Gale Crater Colorized shaded relief map of Gale crater. The general landing area for Curiosity on the northwestern crater floor, named Aeolis Palus, is circled. (HRSC data) Gale is a crater on Mars near the northwestern part of the Aeolis quadrangle. Gale is in diameter and holds a central peak, Aeolis Mons (previously informally named \\"Mount Sharp\\" to pay tribute to geologist Robert P. Sharp) rising higher from the crater floor than Mount Rainier rises above Seattle. Strong evidence suggests that Gale Crater once held a large lake. On 6 August 2012, the Mars Science Laboratory landed on Aeolis Palus near Aeolis Mons in Gale Crater.http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/mars-science-laboratory-curiosity- landing-sites-100615.htm On 5 August 2012, the Mars Science Laboratory rover, 'Curiosity, landed at the foot of a layered mountain inside Gale crater. As the mission progressed, discoveries and conclusions were released from NASA detailing the mounting evidence that Gale once contained a large lake. On 27 September 2012, scientists announced that the Curiosity found evidence for an ancient streambed suggesting a \\"vigorous flow\\" of water on Mars. On 9 December 2013, NASA reported that Gale Crater contained an ancient freshwater lake which could have been a hospitable environment for microbial life. Curiosity found fine-grained sedimentary rocks, which represent an ancient lake that would have been suited to support life based on chemolithoautotrophy. This liquid water environment possessed a neutral pH, low salinity, and iron and sulfur in forms usable to certain types of microorganisms. Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen‚Äîthe essential elements for life were measured. Gale's ancient lake might have lasted hundreds to tens of thousands of years. Clay minerals (trioctahedral) that are formed in the presence of water were found by Curiosity in sedimentary rocks (mudstones) at Yellowknife Bay in Gale Crater. The mudstone samples were named John Klein and Cumberland. They are estimated to have formed later than the Noachian period which means that water may have existed there longer than previously thought. Gale Crater contains a number of alluvial fans and deltas that provide information about lake levels in the past. These formations are: Pancake Delta, Western Delta, Farah Vallis delta and the Peace Vallis Fan.Dietrich, W., M. Palucis, T. Parker, D. Rubin, K.Lewis, D. Sumner, R. Williams. 2014. Clues to the relative timing of lakes in Gale Crater. Eighth International Conference on Mars (2014) 1178.pdf. In a press conference on 8 December 2014, Mars scientists discussed observations by Curiosity rover that show Mars' Mount Sharp was built by sediments deposited in a large lake bed over tens of millions of years. This finding suggests the climate of ancient Mars could have produced long-lasting lakes at many places on the planet. Rock layers indicate that a huge lake was filled and evaporated many times. The evidence was many deltas that were stacked upon each other. Curiosity rover - view of \\"Sheepbed\\" mudstone (lower left) and surroundings (14 February 2013). Gale Crater is considered to be a closed-basin lake, as channels lead into it, but none lead out. Minerals called clays and sulfates are formed only in the presence of water. They also may preserve signs of past life. The history of water at Gale, as recorded in its rocks, is giving Curiosity many clues to study as it pieces together whether Mars ever could have been a habitat for microbes. Gale is special because both clays and sulfate minerals, which formed in water under different conditions, can be observed. Holden Crater Holden is a 140 km wide crater in the Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle. It is named after Edward Singleton Holden, an American astronomer, and the founder of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. Like some other craters on Mars, Holden has an outlet channel, Uzboi Vallis, that runs into it. Some features in the crater, especially lake deposits, seem to have been created by flowing water. The crater's rim is cut with gullies, and at the end of some gullies are fan-shaped deposits of material transported by water. The crater is of great interest to scientists because it has some of the best-exposed lake deposits. One of the layers has been found by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to contain clays.Grotzinger, J. and R. Milliken (eds.) 2012. Sedimentary Geology of Mars. SEPM Clays only form in the presence of water. It is suspected that great amount of water went through this area; one flow was caused by a body of water larger than Earth's Lake Huron. This happened when water burst through a crater rim that was damming it. Holden is an old crater, containing numerous smaller craters, many of which are filled with sediment. Indeed, over 150 m of sediment is exposed in Holden Crater, especially in southwestern part of the crater. The crater's central mountain is also obscured by sediment. Much of the sediment probably originated from river and lake deposits.Grant, J., R. Irwin, S. Wilson. 2010. Aqueous depositional settings in Holden crater, Mars. In Cabrol, N. and E. Grin (eds.). 2010. Lakes on Mars. Elsevier. NY Holden Crater is in the Uzboi- Landon-Morava (ULM) outflow system. Image:Holden Crater Close-up.JPGClose-up of Channels on Rim of Holden Crater, as seen by THEMIS. Image is located in the Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle. Geologic history of Holden Crater Studies of the whole region around Holden Crater have resulted in an understanding of a complex sequence of events that shaped the crater, which included two different lakes.Grant, J. 1987. The geomorphic evolution of Eastern Margaritifer Sinus, Mars. Adv. Planet. Geol. NASA Tech memo. 89889871, 1‚Äì268. A large series of rivers called the Uzboi-Ladon-Morava (ULM) system drained water from the Argyre Basin, site of a large lake.Baker, V. 1982. The Channels of Mars. University of Texas Press, Austin, TX.Saunders, S. 1979. Geologic map of the Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle of Mars, U.S. Geol. Surv. Misc. Invest. Ser. Map I-1144, scale 1:5M. When an impact occurred and produced Holden Crater, the system was blocked by a crater rim almost a kilometer in height. Eventually water from drainage from the walls, with possibly a contribution from groundwater, collected to make the first lake. This lake was deep and long lasting. The lowest level of sedimentary rocks was deposited in this lake. Much water was inbounded in Uzboi Vallis because the rim of Holden Crater blocked the flow. Some of the backed up water came from Nirgal Vallis which had a discharge of 4800 cubic meters/second. At a certain point the stored water broke through the rim of Holden and created a second, shorter lived lake 200‚Äì250 m deep.Grant, J., R. Irwin, S. Wilson. 2010. Aqueous depositional settings in Holden crater, Mars In Cabrol, N. and E. Grin (eds.). 2010. Lakes on Mars. Elsevier. NY. Water with a depth of at least 50 m entered Holden at a rate that 5‚Äì10 times the discharge of the Mississippi River.http://www.uahirise.org/epo/nuggets/lake-uzboi-vallis.pdf Terraces and the presence of large rocks (tens of meters across) support these high discharge rates.Grant, J. 1987.

Geomorphology and geology of the southwestern Margaritifer Sinus-northern Argyre region of Mars, California State University, M. S. Thesis, Los Angeles, California Western Elysium Planitia Paleolake There is evidence for a large lake in Western Elysium; however, some researchers think large lava flows can explain the terrain.Jaeger, W., et al. 2008. Emplacement of Athabasca Vallis flood lavas, Lunar Plan. Sci. Conf. XXIX (CDROM). Abstr. # 1836. The basin of this supposed lake has an area of more than 150 km2 and is covered with fractured plates and sinuous ridges that look like pack-ice on the Earth.Brackenridge, G. 1993. Modern shelf ice, equatorial Aeolis quadrangle, Mars. Lunar Plan. Sci. Conf. XXIV. Abstr. # 175.Rice, J. et al. 2002. Morphology of fresh outflow channel deposits on Mars. Lunar Plan. Sci. Conf. XXXIII (CDROM). Abstr. #2026. Sorted patterned ground and erosion patterns in polygonal terrain in the region support ice- rich material; hence a lake. Also, the presence of streamlined islands, cataracts, and dendritic channel systems suggest formation by water from a lake.Balme, M. et al. 2010. The Western Elysium Planitia Palelake. In Cabrol, N. and E. Grin (eds.). 2010. Lakes on Mars. Elsevier. NY. Some surfaces here show \\"Rootless cones\\" which are mounds with pits. They can be caused by explosions of lava with ground ice when lava flows on top of ice-rich ground. The ice melts and turns into a vapor that expands in an explosion that produces a cone or ring. Features like these are found in Iceland, when lavas cover water-saturated substrates.Jaeger, W., L. Keszthelyi, A. McEwen, C. Dundas, P. Russell, and the HiRISE team. 2007. EARLY HiRISE OBSERVATIONS OF RING/MOUND LANDFORMS IN ATHABASCA VALLES, MARS. Lunar and Planetary Science XXXVIII 1955.pdf. The western Elysium Planitia basin can be described as almost a perfect equipotential surface because it slopes only about 10 m over a 500 km distance‚Äîthat‚Äôs about as level as the Earth‚Äôs ocean.Reigber, C. et al. 2007. A High Resolution Global Gravity Field Model Combining CHAMP and GRACE Satellite Mission and Surface Data: EIGEN-CG01C. GeoForschungsZentrum, Potsdam. Scientific Technical Report STR 06/07. This very gentle slope argues against a lava flow. In places, it has been found that the flow surface has been lowered by 50% which is expected if the flow was of water, but not if it were lava. The maximum depth of the lake was estimated to be between 31 and 53 m. The Western Elysium Paleolake is in the southern part of the Elysium quadrangle, south of the Elysium volcanic field and near Cerberus Fossae. It has been proposed that the water for this paleolake emerged from troughs in Cerberus Fossae. Several ideas have been advanced to explain the exact mechanism, including groundwater discharge and a dike penetrating a cryosphere, Image:Troughs in Elysium Planitia.JPGTroughs of the Cerberus Fossae group, as seen by HiRISE under the HiWish program. Image:Troughs showing blue in Elysium Planitia.JPGPortion of a trough (fossa) in Elysium, as seen by HiRISE under the HiWish program. Troughs are part of the Cerberus Fossae group. Argyre basin The Argyre basin was created by a giant impact that occurred 70 million years after the Hellas impact. It is suspected to have contained a lake early in the history of Mars. The Argyre basin is in the Argyre quadrangle. At least three river valleys (Surius Vallis, Dzigal Vallis, and Palacopus Vallis) drain into it from the south. After the Argyre lake froze solid, the ice formed eskers which are visible today. An article written by 22 researchers in Icarus concluded that the impact that formed the Argyre basin probably struck an ice cap or a thick permafrost layer. Energy from the impact melted the ice and formed a giant lake that eventually sent water to the North. The lake's volume was equal to that of Earth's Mediterranean Sea. The deepest part of the lake may have taken more than a hundred thousand years to freeze, but with the help of heat from the impact, geothermal heating, and dissolved solutes it may have had liquid water for many millions of years. Life may have developed in this time. This region shows a great deal of evidence of glacial activity with flow features, crevasse-like fractures, drumlines, eskers, tarns, aretes, cirques, horns, U-shaped valleys, and terraces. Because of the shapes of Argyre sinuous ridges, the authors concluded that they are eskers. Image:Argyre basin topo.jpgMOLA maps showing the geographic context of Argyre.

Location of this fan is shown in an image displayed above. Water is involved with fan formation. Lakes in Valles Marineris Over the years, it has been suggested that lakes of various sizes existed in the giant Valles Marineris.Lucchitta, B. 2008. HiRISE images of layered deposits in west Candor Chasma, Mars (I): wall rock relations, enigmatic ridges, and possible dikes. 39th Lunar Planet. Sci. Conf. Abstract 2169.Lucchitta, B. 2010. Lakes in Valles Marineris. In Cabrol, N. and E. Grin (eds.). 2010. Lakes on Mars. Elsevier. NY. However, the matter is still debated. Much discussion centers on the origin of layered structures called interior layered deposits (ILD‚Äôs). They are widely distributed in the Valles Marineris system. Some are free-standing mesas and mounds. Interior layered deposits are up to 9 km thick. Parts of the floors of Candor Chasma and Juventae Chasma contain interior layered deposits. These layers may have formed when the whole area was a giant lake. However, many other ideas have been advanced to explain them. High-resolution structural and geologic mapping in west Candor Chasma, presented in March 2015, showed that the deposits on the floor of the Candor chasma are basin filling sediments that were deposited in a wet playa like setting; hence water was involved in their formation. One problem with the idea of large lakes in Valles Marineris is that there are no evident sources for the huge amount of water that would be required. Although many small channels exist in the region, there are no major channels. However, much water may have entered the system through the ground.Murchie, S., et al. 2009. Evidence for the origin of layered deposits in Candor Chasma, Mars, from mineral composition and hydrologic modeling\\" J. Geophys. Res. 114, E00D05 Although much controversy exists concerning a lake that filled the whole Valles Marineris system, there is a fair amount of acceptance over smaller lakes in the system. Parts of the floors of Candor Chasma and Juventae Chasma contain interior layered deposits. These layers may have formed when the whole area was a giant lake. However, many other ideas have been advanced to explain them. High-resolution structural and geologic mapping in west Candor Chasma, presented in March 2015, showed that the deposits on the floor of the Candor chasma are basin filling sediments that were deposited in a wet playa like setting; hence water was involved in their formation. Minerals that are usually formed in the presence of water have been discovered in interior layered deposits; thus giving strong support for lakes. Some ILD‚Äôs contain hydrated sulfate deposits. Sulfate formation involves the presence of water. The European Space Agency's Mars Express found possible evidence of the sulfates epsomite and kieserite. Likewise, ferric oxides in the form of crystalline grey hematite that probably required water for its formation have been found. Ritchey Crater Ritchey Crater is a crater in the Coprates quadrangle. It is 79 km in diameter and was named after George W. Ritchey, an American astronomer (1864‚Äì1945). There is strong evidence that it was once a lake. Ritchey Crater has been suggested as a landing site for a Mars Rover. A thick sequence of sedimentary deposits that include clay is found in the crater.Milliken, R., et al. 2010. The case for mixed-layered clays on Mars, Lunar Planet. Sci. XLI, Abstract 2030 Clay deposits indicate that water was probably present for a time. The presence of fluvial features along crater wall and rim, as well as alluvial/fluvial deposits, support the idea of much water being present at some time in the past.

Jezero Crater Viking 1 Orbiter] Jezero is a crater on Mars located at in the Syrtis Major quadrangle. The diameter of the crater is about . Thought to have once been flooded with water, the crater contains a fan-delta deposit rich in clays. Proposed Mars 2020 landing site inside Jezero crater. Jezero crater, once considered a site for the Mars Science Laboratory, is a proposed landing site for the Mars 2020 rover mission. Clay minerals have been detected in and around the crater. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter identified smectite clays. Clays form in the presence of water, so this area probably once held water and maybe life in ancient times. The surface in places are cracked into polygonal patterns. Such shapes often form when clay dries out. Researchers described in a paper, released in March 2015, how an ancient Martian lake system existed in Jezero Crater. The study advanced the idea that water filled the crater at least two separate times. There are two channels on the northern and western sides of the crater that probably supplied it with water; both of these channels have delta-like deposit where sediment was carried by water and deposited in the lake. Pictures show layers and meanders. A primary aim of the Mars 2020 mission is to search for signs of ancient life. It is hoped that a later mission could then return samples from sites identified as probably containing remains of life. To safely bring the craft down, a 12-mile (20 km) wide, smooth, flat circular area is needed. Geologists hope to examine places where water once ponded. They would like to examine sediment layers. Eridania Lake Eridania Lake is a theorized ancient lake with a surface area of roughly 1.1 million square kilometers.de Pablo, M., M. Druet. 2002. XXXIII LPSC. Abstract #1032.de Pablo, M. 2003. VI Mars Conference, Abstract #3037. Its maximum depth is 2,400 meters and its volume is 562,000 km3. It was larger than the largest landlocked sea on Earth, the Caspian Sea and contained more water than all the other martian lakes together. The Eridania sea held more than 9 times as much water as all of America's Great Lakes.http://www.sci-news.com/space/mars-eridania-basin-vast- sea-05301.html The upper surface of the lake was assumed to be at the elevation of valley networks that surround the lake; they all end at the same elevation, suggesting that they emptied into a lake.Baker, D., J. Head. 2014. 44th LPSC, abstract #1252 PIA22059 fig1eridaniadepths.jpgMap showing estimated water depth in different parts of Eridania Sea This map is about 530 miles across. PIA22059 fig1eridaniadepthslabeled.jpgFeatures around Eridania Sea labeled Three basins make up the lake Ariadnes (centered at 175 E, 35 S), Atlantis (Centered at 182 E, 32 S), and Gorgonum (Centered at 192 E, 37 S).Pajola, M., et al. 2016. Eridania Basin: An ancient paleolake floor as the next landing site for the Mars 2020 rover. Icauus: 275, 163‚Äì1823. It is located at the source of the Ma'adim Vallis outflow channel and extends into Eridania quadrangle and the Phaethontis quadrangle. As Eridania Lake dried out in the late Noachian epoch it divided into a series of smaller lakes. Clays which require water for their formation have been found within the borders of this supposed lake. They were identified as Mg/Fe-bearing phyllosilicates and Al-rich phyllosilicates, using with hyperspectral data from CRISM. Further study, published in 2016, using both OMEGA (Visible and Infrared Mineralogical Mapping Spectrometer on Mars Express) and CRISM found that a capping layer lies above an Al-rich clay layer (probably Al-smectite and/or kaolins). Beneath this layer is Fe-rich clay, called nontronite smectite, and then a layer of zeolite or hydrated sulfate. Small deposits of alunite and jarosite were also discovered. The clay minerals provide favorable conditions for the preservation of past Martian life traces. Later research with CRISM found thick deposits, greater than 400 meters thick, that contained the minerals saponite, talc-saponite, Fe-rich mica (for example, glauconite-nontronite), Fe- and Mg-serpentine, Mg-Fe-Ca-carbonate and probable Fe-sulphide. The Fe- sulphide probably formed in deep water from water heated by volcanoes. Such a process, classified as hydrothermal may have been a place where life began. Saponite, talc, talc-saponite, nontronite, glauconite, and serpentine are all common on the seafloors on Earth. The earliest evidence of life on Earth appear in seafloor deposits that are similar to those found in the Eridania basin. So, samples of material from the Eridania may give us insight into the environment of the early Earth. Chloride deposits were found where a shoreline existed. They were deposited as water evaporated from the sea. These chloride deposits are thought to be thin (less than 30 meters), because some craters do not display the chemical in their ejecta. A crater's ejecta contains material from under the surface, therefore if the chloride deposits were very deep they would have appeared in the ejecta. PIA22058 hireseridanaregion.jpgDeep-basin deposits from the floor of Eridania Sea. The mesas on the floor are there because they were protected against intense erosion by deep water/ice cover. CRISM measurements show minerals may be from seafloor hydrothermal deposits. Life may have originated in this sea. PIA22060 hireseridania.jpgDiagram showing how volcanic activity may have caused deposition of minerals on floor of Eridania Sea. Chlorides were deposited along the shoreline by evaporation. At a 2018 planetary science conference in Texas, a paper was presented that suggested that the deep water lake waters of Eridania may have hosted ancient life. This environment was rich in energy and chemical nutrients. The earliest evidence of life on Earth is similar to this type of deep sea environment.Michalsk, J., et al. 2018. THE CASE FOR HYDROTHERMAL SEAFLOOR-TYPE DEPOSITS IN THE ERIDANIA BASIN ON MARS. 49th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference 2018 (LPI Contrib. No. 2083). 1757pdf Columbus crater Columbus Crater is a crater in the Memnonia quadrangle, is 119 km in diameter, and was named after Christopher Columbus, Italian explorer (1451‚Äì1506). Research with an orbiting near-infrared spectrometer, which reveals the types of minerals present based on the wavelengths of light they absorb, found evidence of layers of both clay and sulfates in Columbus crater. This is exactly what would appear if a large lake had slowly evaporated. Moreover, because some layers contained gypsum, a sulfate which forms in relatively fresh water, life could have formed in the crater. The CRISM instrument on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter found kaolinite, hydrated sulfates including alunite and possibly jarosite. Further study concluded that gypsum, polyhydrated and monohydrated Mg/Fe-sulfates were common and small deposits of montmorillonite, Fe/Mg-phyllosilicates, and crystalline ferric oxide or hydroxide were found. Thermal emission spectra suggest that some minerals were in the tens of percent range. These minerals suggest that water was present in the crater. Scientists are excited about finding hydrated minerals such as sulfates and clays on Mars because they are usually formed in the presence of water. Places that contain clays and/or other hydrated minerals would be good places to look for evidence of life. Sulfate minerals were found above aluminum-rich clays; this implies that early on, when the clays were formed, the water was more neutral and probably easier for life to develop. Sulfates are usually formed with more acid waters being present. Image:Columbus Crater Layers.JPGColumbus Crater Layers, as seen by HiRISE. This false-color image is about 800 feet across. Some of the layers contain hydrated minerals. Navua Valles Navua Valles channels northeast of the Hellas Basin that may have also hosted a large, ice-covered lake in the past. Southern polar cap subglacial lake subglacial water body In 2018, it was announced that a subglacial lake was discovered below the south polar ice cap of Mars. The lake was detected by Mars Express orbiter, and is long, lying under ca. of glacial cover, with water temperature estimated to be , and having an extremely salty brine. In September 2020, scientists confirmed the existence of several large saltwater lakes under the ice in the south polar region of the planet Mars.

By expending energy to power the enzyme Na+/K+-ATPase and in coordination with other protein transporters, marine teleost ionocytes pump excessive sodium and chloride ions against the concentration gradient into the ocean. Conversely, freshwater teleost ionocytes use this low intracellular environment to attain sodium and chloride ions into the organism, and also against the concentration gradient. In larval fishes with underdeveloped / developing gills, ionocytes can be found on the skin and fins. Mechanism of action Marine teleost fishes consume large quantities of seawater to reduce osmotic dehydration. The excess of ions absorbed from seawater is pumped out of the teleost fishes via the ionocytes. These cells use active transport on the basolateral (internal) surface to accumulate chloride, which then diffuses out of the apical (external) surface and into the surrounding environment. Such mitochondrion- rich cells are found in both the gill lamellae and filaments of teleost fish. Using a similar mechanism, freshwater teleost fish use these cells to take in salt from their dilute environment to prevent hyponatremia from water diffusing into the fish.

He worked on a farm from the age of eleven to seventeen. After his mother remarried, they lived on Lake George. Orrin's brother, Julius Ingram, would become a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly. Career Ingram started his career at Harris & Bronson Lumber Company in New York City in 1847. The company was active in the Pharaoh Lake Wilderness Area. Later, he worked for Fox & Englin, building a sawmill on the Rideau Canal and several sawmills on the Moira River, both of which are in Canada. Shortly after, the built another sawmill in Ottawa, Canada, for Harris & Bronson. He was then hired by Gilmour & Company, another Canadian lumber company.

Shown is an example of a HeLa cell cultured on a glass surface. For visualization of DNA and mitotic phase assignment, the cell expresses Histone H2B-GFP to provide fluorescent labeling of chromosomes. Transmitted light (DIC), fluorescence (GFP), and merged images are shown every 4 minutes as the cell transitions from G2 phase through mitosis to telophase/G1 phase. Mitotic cell rounding is a shape change that occurs in most animal cells that undergo mitosis. Cells abandon the spread or elongated shape characteristic of interphase and contract into a spherical morphology during mitosis. The phenomena is seen both in artificial cultures in vitro and naturally forming tissue in vivo. Early observations In 1935, one of the first published accounts of mitotic rounding in live tissue described cell rounding in the pseudostratified epithelium of the mammalian neural tube. Sauer noticed that cells in mitosis rounded up to the apical, or luminal, surface of the columnar epithelium before dividing and returning to their elongated morphology. Significance For a long time it was not clear why cells became round in mitosis. Recent studies in the epithelia and epidermis of various organisms, however, show that mitotic cell rounding might serve several important functions. * Firstly, mitotic cell rounding in combination with maintenance of apical cell-cell junctions appears to be necessary for correct mitotic spindle alignment, so that daughter cells divide parallel to the tissue plane, thus sharing apical surface to maintain tissue homeostasis. Failure to achieve this may result in mislocalization of one daughter cell to the basal region on the tissue layer and clearance via apoptotic cell death. * Secondly, mitotic rounding has been proposed to be a driver for morphological events during tissue development. Examples include epithelial invagination of the Drosophila melanogaster tracheal placode and the anisotropic shape and growth of the inner ear lumen in Zebrafish. * Thirdly, mitotic rounding has been shown to be important to generate sufficient space and appropriate geometry for proper mitotic spindle function, which is necessary for timely and accurate progression through mitosis. Thus, mitotic cell rounding is involved in tissue organization and homeostasis. Mechanisms To understand the physical mechanisms of how cells round up in mitosis, researchers have conducted mechanical measurements with cultured cells in vitro. The forces that drive cell rounding have recently been characterized by researchers from the groups of Professors Tony Hyman and Daniel Muller, who used flat atomic force microscopy cantilevers to constrain mitotic cells and measure the response force. More than 90% of the forces are generated by the collective activity of myosin II molecular motors in the actin cortex. As a result, the surface tension and effective stiffness of the actin cortex increase as has been consistently observed in mitotic cells. This in turn yields an increase in intracellular hydrostatic pressure due to the Law of Laplace, which relates surface tension of a fluid interface to the differential pressure sustained across that interface. The increase in hydrostatic pressure is important because it produces the outward force necessary to push and rounds up against external objects or impediments, such as flexible cantilever or soft gel (in vitro examples), or surrounding extracellular matrix and neighboring cells (in vivo examples). In HeLa cells in vitro, the force generated by a half-deformed mitotic cell is on the order of 50 to 100 nanonewtons. Internal hydrostatic pressure has been measured to increase from below 100 pascals in interphase to 3 to 10 fold that in mitosis. In similar in vitro experiments, it was found that the threshold forces required to prevent mitosis are in excess of 100 nN. At threshold forces the cell suffers a loss of cortical F-actin uniformity, which further amplifies the susceptibility to applied force. These effects potentiate distortion of cell dimensions and subsequent perturbation of mitotic progression via spindle defects. Release of stable focal adhesions is another important aspect of mitotic rounding. Cells that are genetically perturbed to manifest constitutively active adhesion regulators are unable to properly remodel their focal adhesions and facilitate the generation of a uniform actomyosin cortex. Overall, the biochemical events governing the morphological and mechanical changes in mitotic cells are orchestrated by the mitotic master regulator Cdk1. Apart from actomyosin-related genes, several disease genes have recently been implicated in mitotic cell rounding. These include Parkinson‚Äôs disease associated DJ-1/Park7 and FAM134A/RETREG2.

And with World War Two looming at the end of the 1930s, trade was further affected during this period.Time Out Guides Ltd. (2009). Time Out Dubai (4th ed.). Time Out. Although Dubai quickly recovered from the second world war as oil is discovered in the Trucial States, sparking a major economic boost for the region where immigration, trade and general business flourished.Krane, J. (2009). Dubai: The Story of the World's Fastest City (1st ed.). New York: St. Martin's Press. As a result, the growth in the Indian and Pakistani population of Dubai gave new life to the Dubai Textile Souk. The discovery of oil was a game-changer for Dubai, and is what ultimately sparked the rapid globalisation of the city. In 1971 a Dubai International Airport was established and opened. By 1979, Jebel Ali Port and the Dubai Trade Centre, the first high rise buildings were erected, the first of many ambitious, rapid and phenomenal architectural projects. This intense modernisation of Dubai, ultimately is what sparked an increase in tourism within the city.UAE BARQ. (2018).

This rapid change from traditional to modern, coupled with the increase in tourism, the Dubai Textile souk became a key tourist attraction of the ‚Äòold Dubai‚Äô. The old Souk‚Äôs actual trade use was eradicated by the globalisation, hence vendors altered what they were selling to be more popular with tourists whilst also keeping some traditions. Although trade is still prevalent along the Dubai Creek, the souk‚Äôs play less of a roll in the process on a large scale level. There still some wholesale companies behind souk areas, but they do not play large roles in trade. Mathew, N. (2014). Understanding Space, Politics and History in the Making of Dubai, a Global City. Department Of History, Faculty Of Humanities, University Of The Witwatersrand,.  Indian and Pakistani influence  The history of the Bur Dubai and Dubai Creek region which is where the Dubai Textile Market is located, has led to a large Indian and Pakistani influence due to the large amount of Indian and Pakistani traders having settled in the region over the history of trade in the Dubai Creek Region.Vora, N. (2013). Impossible Citizens: Dubai's Indian Diaspora. Durham: Duke University Press. This has formed what is now known as ‚ÄòHindi Lane‚Äô which consists of little Indian shops selling arrays of bindis, bangles, flowers, saris and other religious items. Indian influence has also formed other main sections of the textile souk such as Al Fahidi Street where vendors mainly sell Indian clothes, shoes and jewellery. Similarly, the Pakistani influence is seen in the selling of pashminas traditionally from Pakistan and salwar kameez, the traditional outfit of Pakistan.Time Out Guides Ltd. (2009).

Pre-Modern era of traditional walkable souks  The pre-modern architecture of souks was developed prior to the 1960s. Walkability is an essential in the extreme weather of Dubai, narrow alleys (sikkas) of the shopping streets of the Old Souk providing essential day-long shade and increased the likelihood of wind velocity, particularly from the Dubai Creek, helping to lower temperatures. To further reduce temperatures in the souk are the barajeel, which are wind towers perched on top of traditional merchant house, which was effective throughout history as technology and electricity were not around.Sunday Times.

The deity Kethu is located north-east of this shiva temple. The Kethu story is related to the churning of Parkadal (milky way) for nectar. Lord Vishnu wanted to distribute the nectar only to devas but asura raghu also received the nectar and swallowed, this incident has been found by sun and moon and reported to Vishu. Vishu beheaded the rahu but he did not die because he swallowed the nectar, then his head is called as Rahu and his body is called as Kethu. Worship All devotees are request to see the shiva and parvathi first, then go to the kethu that is located north east of the shiva temple. Here kethu is worshipping shiva as well as shiva is a supreme god in this temple, so first worship shiva then do the pooja for kethu.

Some consider Dallenbach's studies of attention to be his most important of these contributions, while others maintain that his studies on facial vision and retention during sleep belong to the classical psy- chological literature. A contribution that is perhaps Dallenbach's greatest contribution to psychology was his purchase, from G.

History  In 2020, a proposal for constructing a dam with reservoir of 100 million cubic feet water storing capacity across the River Varaganadhi at an estimated cost of Rs.791 lakhs was passed. Technical Sanction for a sum of Rs.870.1 lakhs was granted to the Chief Engineer, PWD. The dam construction works were started on 20.07.1982 but got delayed due to the delay in acquisition of 14.55 hectare land from the Forest Department. The works were resumed since 1985. It was found that there were no hard rocks beneath the proposed site and so the geological department was contacted to offer clearance in this regard. The works were restarted on 1997 November and completed by M/s ECCI company on 2001. Dr. M. Karunanidhi, the then Chief Minister of Tamilnadu paid a visit to the dam site and pace of work accelerated. The dam reached its maximum capacity and overflowed for the first time on 15.11.2001.

The film documents the history and subsequent decline of the Wardenclyffe complex designed and built by Tesla in Shoreham, New York, as the main laboratory and facility for his experiments on wireless power transmission. Sikorski focuses his documentary on the role of J.P. Morgan, one of the main investors behind the project, claiming Morgan pulled his support after realizing free wireless energy would hurt his own business interests. Tesla could not find additional investments and in 1906 the project was abandoned and never became operational. After over a century of decay, the tower site was rescued by a successful fundraising campaign and will be converted into a museum ‚Äì the Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe ‚Äì honoring the legacy of the Serbian American inventor. The film builds on Fragments from Olympus, a feature and original screenplay about Tesla's life written by Joseph Sikorski and Michael Calomino which received a \\"best screenplay\\" award at the Long Island International Film Expo in 2010. The distribution of the documentary was supported by a crowdfunding campaign hosted on Indiegogo and by an appeal published by comics writer Matthew Inman, who also features in the film.

He studied and taught philosophy, mathematics, and psychophysics. He published works across a diverse range of subjects including the curative effects of hypnotism.  Early life and education  Joseph Delboeuf was born in the French speaking town of Liege, Belgium. His father, a pewter craftsman, died early in Delboeuf‚Äôs life. He studied at the University of Li√®ge, earning his PhD in philosophy in 1855, followed by physics and mathematics in 1858. He received a scholarship from the University of Bonn and continued his postdoctoral research under philosopher and mathematician Friedrich Ueberweg. In 1860, he began teaching Greek at l‚ÄôEcole Normale des Humanit√©s de Li√®ge. In 1863, he was given the post of Maitre de Conf√©rences, which he only held for a few months before being appointed Chair of Philosophy at University of Ghent, leaving his research in mathematics. There, he met Joseph Plateau, who helped him publish his first two notes on optical illusions in the Bulletin of the Royal Academy of Belgium. He then began his research in psychophysics with Gustav Fechner in 1865. Work Delboeuf began his psychophysical experimentation on brightness in 1865 with Gustav Fechner. Delboeuf introduced the concept of sense distance (contraste sensible). Delboeuf is known for his description of the Delboeuf illusion in 1893. Many experiments have been performed on this illusion since that time.  Hypnotism  After completing work on sleep and dreams, Delboeuf started researching magnetism and hypnotism. At the First International Congress on scientific and experimental hypnotism (1889), a motion was put forward to ban non-medical practitioners from using hypnosis. However, Delboeuf argued that a medical degree was not required to practice hypnotism; rather, it should be used freely, yet with caution. Along with a group of magnetizers in Verviers, he argued that hypnotists had specific personal skills that could not be acquired by all doctors. Thus, the clinical technique of hypnotism was proposed as an alternative to traditional medical therapies. = Curative effects = Most of the work Delboeuf published was on the curative effects of hypnotism. However, his hypotheses were often difficult to test and falsify. To test his hypotheses, he suggested that he would need two identical patients to be treated with different approaches. Instead, he used the symmetry of the opposite sides of the body. He would make two identical lesions on two parts of the body (e.g., arms) and would apply hypnotism to one area while leaving the other alone for nature to act upon. He found that not only can the consequences of pain be avoided from hypnotic suggestion (i.e., no pain experienced), but that over the course of the injury or disease, the actual effects of the operation could be halted overtime. Hypnotism's mode of action, concluded Delboeuf, is like pain, in that it \\"hypnotizes\\" by calling attention to itself. Thus, hypnotic suggestion prevents the effects of pain by withdrawing attention from it. = Post hypnotic suggestion = Delboeuf, with Hippolyte Bernheim in 1885, introduced a new solution to the problem of post hypnotic suggestion. They argued that subjects drifted into a dream-like state in which they became aware of the suggestion and time remaining in this state. Their idea was very similar to a double consciousness theory suggested by Pierre Janet. They highlighted that subjects are unable to remember the suggestion when they wake because the memory is only available in the dream- like or hypnotic state. In other words, they describe the memory being in a ‚Äúdormant‚Äù state that returns during the hypnotic state. Delboeuf argued that the amnesia from waking from hypnotic sleep was similar to that from waking up from regular sleep. We tend not to remember our dreams because we are unable to establish a connection between the waking and dream state. We do, however, tend to remember dreams when we wake up in the middle of a dream because our waking and dreaming state bridge together. Therefore, Delboeuf predicted that subjects should be able to recall their hypnotic sleep if they were awakened in the middle of it. He tested his predictions in an experiment with Marie Wittman, who was awakened in the middle of a hypnotic hallucination and remembered everything. Delboeuf repeated his experiment with other subjects with similar results. His experiments convinced him of the similarity between normal dreams and hypnotic states.  Mathematics  During his time at the University of Bonn, Delboeuf published Prol√©gom√®nes philosophiques √† la g√©om√©trie (1860), disputing his mentor Ueberweg‚Äôs concept of Euclidean space and earning the praise of Bertrand Russell. He argued that, in order to use geometry to find the fundamental qualities of ‚Äúdeterminations of space,‚Äù we must first understand the concepts of both ‚Äúdetermination‚Äù and ‚Äúspace.‚Äù In this paper, he independently discovered Euclidean postulate 5. Postulate 5 states that, if a line intersects two straight lines that together form two interior angles on the same side that sum to less than 180 degrees, then the two straight lines must meet on that side. = Psychophysics = Delboeuf first conducted psychophysics experiments at the University of Gand (1855-1866). He primarily worked on Weber's Law (proposed by Fechner): S = K logI - Where S is equivalent to the strength of a sensation, I is equivalent to the intensity of an external stimulus, and K is a constant. Delboeuf proposed two main changes to Fechner's formula. The first change was related to mathematical aspects. Delboeuf argued that, in some cases, Fechner's formula would result in negative values for S. For example if I=0, then S<0. Delboeuf proposed that, because S did not make sense as a negative value, the formula could not be applicable to all cases. For example, in cases where the strength of a sensation may lead to inability to view an external stimulus (e.g., due to glare), the formula would not be applicable. To address this issue, Delbeouf added a term to the end of Fechner's equation: S = K log [(I+c)/c] - Where c is equivalent to the physiological level of excitation within the senses. Delboeuf's second change to Fechner's formula was the addition of a supplementary equation: f=log [m/m-I'] - Where f is equivalent to the amount of fatigue from effort of the sense organ, m is equivalent to the amount of available sensitivity, and I is equivalent to the intensity of an external stimulus. This supplementary equation accounted for the amount of change that a sense organ experiences due to the magnitude of excitation from an external stimulus. By adding this equation, Delboeuf was accounting for the effect that sensations have on sense organs. = General Theory of Sensitivity = Delboeuf investigated the laws of nature and sensation in his paper \\"General Theory of Sensitivity.\\" Delboeuf proposed that a sensation consists of two aspects: (1) formation of the sensation and (2) how sense organs function. Delboeuf further proposed three laws that can be applied to determine sensation strength: 1. Law of Degradation: as soon as a sensation occurs, the strength of a sensation begins to degrade. 2. Law of Intensity: in order for a sensation to increase in strength, it must be stimulated by excitations that are also increasing in magnitude. 3. Law of Tension: as the strength of a sensation increases, the level of tension also increases. Tension is associated with unpleasantness, pain, fatigue and even the destruction of the sensation itself.  Visual illusions  Delboeuf illusion (1865) Delboeuf started researching perception after meeting Joseph Plateau (1801-1883), a physicist known for his work on vision. After this encounter, Delboeuf changed his focus from Fechnerian psychophysics to the psychology of perception. His first work on illusions was a discussion of Zollner's Pseudoscopy (1865) in which he proposes a theory that all optical illusions could be explained by the muscular strength and structure of the eye. He went on to publish a work on Optico-Geometic Illusions, in which he reinforces his proposed theory. These works led Delboeuf to develop an experiment on an optico-geometric illusion that later became known as the Delboeuf illusion (1865). This illusion is based on the idea that stimuli can be perceived as larger or smaller based on their illumination and surroundings. Delboeuf is well known for his work on this illusion. Later in his career, he published an explanation of the Muller-Lyer Illusion in terms of eye movements instead of the mis-estimation of angles theory Brentano had published. Many studies have been conducted on the Delboeuf illusion (1865) since the publication of his original study, and many explanations for this illusion have been put forth.

Redish has written 19 books and over a hundred law review articles in the areas of civil procedure and constitutional law, among others. He is among the most frequently cited American legal scholars. Legal theories First Amendment Redish supports an \\"autonomy theory\\" of free speech, taking the view that the First Amendment protects speech in order to advance individuals' interest in the self-realization that they obtain by being able to speak without government interference. According to Redish, all of the other values attached to free speech, such as the advancement of liberal democracy, necessarily depend on the concept of individual self-realization. This view contrasts with that of scholars such as Alexander Meiklejohn, who advocate a theory of the First Amendment based on the importance of democratic self- governance, and of scholars who subscribe to the theory that the First Amendment exists to promote the marketplace of ideas. Career Redish has spent his entire academic career at Northwestern University, where he has been a faculty member since 1973. Before entering academia, he briefly practiced law in New York.

Personal life William Caddick was reportedly well acquainted with Richard Wright and George Stubbs, both slightly his junior. From 1766 William, the artist, lived in Old Hall Street (his house was in the part known as North Walk), and he probably died there in 1794. He married Eliza, or Elizabeth, Wood of Burslem, a member of the noted family of potters. She was born on 11 June 1724, and died on 17 September 1795. They had two sons, William Caddick, junior, and Richard. Richard was born about 1750, perhaps earlier; William was probably younger. Both became painters. William Caddick is therefore sometimes referred to as Caddick senior but references and works relating to him and both junior sons may be easily confused. In 1780 W. Caddick, junior (North Walk, Liverpool), made the family's sole appearance at the 1780 Royal Academy exhibition, with a 'Portrait in the character of Circe'. As W. Caddick, senior, was then sixty-one years of age, and his father had been dead many years, this picture is assumed to have been by his son. This panel portrait, restored in 2001, is believed to be of Stubbs' mistress, Mary Spencer. Irrespective of which Caddick painted it, it provides further evidence that the Caddick family remained acquainted with Stubbs after the latter moved to London. Career Caddick was the sole artist listed in the first Street Directory of Liverpool, published in 1760. The initial spelling Caddock was used until the editions of 1774. Caddick, described as the 'elder statesman of Liverpool Artists', was offered and accepted the Presidency of the Liverpool Society of Artists. Works Few of Caddick's attributed surviving works are known. The Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, holds four. One of these is a portrait, painted in 1747, of Aaron Wood, his brother-in-law, a worthy of whom it is recorded that ' he was never heard [or known] to swear, chew tobacco, take snuff, or whistle or sing in his life, and was considered the most lively, pleasant, and merriest man in the county' though Dibdin observes that \\"W.

The native of a rural area west of Bra»ôov, he attended high school in that city and ultimately earned a university degree in Vienna. While still a pupil, he entered the newspaper business, and his political writings during World War I led the authorities to imprison him for about a year. After the war, he resumed his journalistic activity, editing and leading a variety of publications, most notably the Cluj-based Societatea de m√¢ine. A social democrat by conviction, he held a series of mid-level positions under the communist regime. Biography Early life and education Born in Poiana MƒÉrului, Bra»ôov County, in the Transylvania region that was then part of Austria-Hungary, his parents were Ion Clopo»õel and Susana (n√©e LƒÉzƒÉroiu). After primary school in his native village, he attended Andrei »òaguna High School in Bra»ôov from 1904 to 1912. Due to his good grades and material poverty, he received scholarship assistance in the latter part of this period. He was mentored by teachers who included the cultural figures Virgil Oni»õiu, Iosif Blaga and Axente Banciu. Also while in high school, he became exposed to the writings of Nicolae Iorga, developing a passion for his works and a desire to meet him personally. Traveling at considerable expense to VƒÉlenii de Munte in the Romanian Old Kingdom, he attended Iorga's \\"summer university\\" for five years in a row. In mid-1911, struck by the youth's enthusiasm, the latter asked Clopo»õel to inventory and catalogue his personal archive and library.Negru, pp. 9-10 Clopo»õel pursued university studies at Cluj, Budapest and, after Rom√¢nul was shut down in March 1916, Vienna. He took a degree in literature, specializing in Romance philology, and philosophy. While a student, he was especially interested in sociology; a member of his discussion circle was Lucian Blaga, whom he had known since high school. After Vienna, he deepened his sociological background by taking courses at the University of Paris.Negru, pp. 12-14 Journalistic and political activity He made his publishing debut in 1911 at Rom√¢nul newspaper in Arad, when he also became editing intern. Immediately after graduating high school in 1912, Vasile Goldi»ô hired him at the newspaper, where he gradually rose from proofreader to editor-in- chief by the time he left in 1919.Negru, pp. 11, 15 His publications there included reports from VƒÉlenii de Munte and reflections on cultural life in the Old Kingdom.Negru, p. 11 In 1917, he took a high school teaching post at Caransebe»ô. At the end of the year, together with leaders of the Romanian national movement in Transylvania, he was imprisoned at Szeged; his increased political activity had led to a charge of \\"crimes against the interest of the army and the state\\". In particular, his writings in the Lugoj-based Drapelul drew the authorities' ire. Released on October 1, 1918,Negru, p. 14 amidst the breakdown of the empire that occurred near the close of World War I, he took part in negotiations for the union of Transylvania with Romania and attended the Great National Assembly in Alba Iulia which ratified the union, serving as press secretary. He was editor-in-chief of the provincial newspapers Gazeta Transilvaniei (the Bra»ôov-based outfit where Mihai Popovici and Alexandru Vaida-Voevod hired him between 1919 and 1921), Patria and »òoimul. He also worked as Transylvania editor of the Bucharest newspapers AdevƒÉrul, Diminea»õa, Libertatea and of the magazines Lumea nouƒÉ, Pagini literare and Societatea de m√¢ine (the last from 1924 to 1945); and was a contributor to LuceafƒÉrul. While a resident of Cluj from 1921 to 1934, he made Patria into a mass-circulation newspaper and hosted fruitful debates on sociology and politics within its editorial committee. He also founded Societatea de m√¢ine, which became one of interwar Romania's leading social, political and cultural magazines.Negru, p. 16 Moving to the national capital Bucharest in 1934, he continued at AdevƒÉrul and Diminea»õa while moving Societatea de m√¢ine with him.Negru, p. 17 Due to his left-wing views, he was invited to join Lumea nouƒÉ in 1945 by Lothar RƒÉdƒÉceanu; there, he edited the foreign news and wrote about the situation in Transylvania.Negru, p. 18 Among the pseudonyms he used were L. Ardelean, I. Bobei, Dumitru Corvinul, Euphraste, Traian Huniade, I. Poenaru, Dr. Titus Popa, Teofrast, Theophraste, I. SƒÉgeatƒÉ and Horia Trandafir. Later years As president of the Romanian Press Union from 1920 to 1936, he laid the groundwork for a journalists' cultural institute. In 1926, he founded a journalists' library and Almanahul presei rom√¢ne. He was elected to the Assembly of Deputies, representing FƒÉgƒÉra»ô. In 1944, after the King Michael Coup, he edited the socialist Poporul newspaper from Bra»ôov, intending to use it to reorganize the country along social democratic lines. He was also president of the regional organization of the Romanian Social Democratic Party, to which he had belonged since 1930.Negru, pp. 17-18 With the gradual onset of a communist regime, he became inspector-general of workers' schools (appointed by RƒÉdƒÉceanu), rector of the Free University of Bra»ôov and director of the Central University Library of Bucharest, retiring in 1961.Negru, p. 15 He authored the four-volume Antologia a scriitorilor rom√¢ni de la 1821 √Æncoace (1917-1918), in which he selected passages from both representative and lesser known Romanian-language authors of the previous century.Negru, p. 39 While this was his only large-scale work of literary history, his activity as historian and critic continued at Societatea de m√¢ine, where he reviewed forty-six novels.Negru, p. 44 His memoirs appeared as FrƒÉm√¢ntƒÉrile unui an. 1918 (1919) and Amintiri »ôi portrete (1975).

Her research has \\"identified several genetic mutations that cause common syndromes such as the fragile X syndrome and Autism\\". Meguid has a Ph.D. in Human Genetics. Nagwa Abdel Meguid‚Äôs research interests include clinical genetics, neurodevelopmental disorders, human DNA technology, and dysmorphology. Life Meguid graduated from Arabian Gulf University. She is a fellow of Uppsala University.  Education  Meguid is head of a laboratory researching DNA and biochemical changes in genetic disorders such as autism and fragile X syndrome. She is the head of the Department of Research on Children with Special Needs at the National Research Center (NRC) located in Egypt. Meguid is a Senior Geneticist at the Genetics Institute in Pasadena, California. Meguid holds memberships in the Regional Bio-Ethics Society and Gender Research in Africa into Information Communication Technologies for Empowerment (GRACE).  Awards  Meguid has prestigious awards for her research in genetics such as the National Award for Scientific Excellence (2009), National Research Centre Appreciation Prize in Medical Sciences (2011), and the Distinctive Arab Female Scientist Prize to name a few. She has also won the prize for the state of Scientific Excellence in Advanced Technology (2008).  Research on Genetic Disorders  Meguid has contributed to the research and discovery of gene mutations causing common genetic disorders in the Egyptian population. These genetic disorders include phenylketonuria, Duchene muscular dystrophy, congenital sensorineural hearing loss and fragile X-syndrome. Meguid has developed methods to prevent certain genetic mutations, which includes heterozygous detection and prenatal diagnosis. She has diagnosed autosomal recessive disorders in Egyptians as a result of a high prevalence of consanguinity in the population.  Fragile X Syndrome and Autism Research  Meguid first discovered the prevalence of fragile X mutation among Egyptian males. The mutation occurred 0.9 per 1000 Egyptian males.Meguid, Nagwa Abdel; Abdel-Raouf, Ehab R Abdel-Raouf; Dardir, Ahmed; El Awady, Mostafa. (2007). Prevalence of fragile X syndrome among school-age Egyptian males. World J Pediatr, 3(4), 271-275. h http://wjpch.com/UploadFile/20074005.pdf There was a 6.4% prevalence that the mutation would occur in males who were mentally subnormal. Meguid determined that the high prevalence of fragile X in Arab mentally subnormal males may be a result of awareness or diagnoses of the disease. Egyptian males had a late recognition of this genetic mutation past their childhood. The genetic mutations could be predicted as the disease was related to an increased percentage of consanguineous marriages in the Arab population. A delayed awareness of the genetic mutation was also a common cause of other disorders related to mental subnormality. Meguid concluded that the high prevalence of fragile X syndrome should promote special education for those affected. She suggested that an individualized treatment plan starting in preschool could allow students to be more successful in their educational years. Meguid analyzed brain morphology in both fragile x syndrome with autistic features and autism patients and determined if there are any significant differences in the genetic disorders. 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used. No significant differences were found in brain morphology including \\"total brain volume, regional volume, gyrification index, sulcal depth, and cerebral cortical thickness.\\" Autistic patients had a decrease in the medial prefrontal bilaterally and left anterior cingulate cortices of the brain. The medial prefrontal and the anterior cingulate were found to be significant in social cognition and autistic and fragile X patients were deficient in both. The deficiency in brain morphological features accounted for a social cognitive deficit. Fragile X with autistic features reflected selectively higher scores on social withdrawal scales - deficits were significantly different than those of autistic individuals. Fragile X autistic characteristics were shared with that of idiopathic autism however. Meguid developed a simple molecular screening method to detect premutation carriers of fragile X syndrome. A premutation carrier is an individual who has between 55-200 CGG repeats in the Fragile X (FMR1) gene. The full mutation has over 200 CGG repeats. The procedure included a rapid modified polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based screening tool for expanded Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) alleles. The results showed that 16 males out of 53 males had the CGG abnormal repeats characteristic of Fragile X gene. 10 of their mothers and 4 of their sisters also had the FMR1 premutation. 66.6% consanguineous marriages were present in the families studied. It was concluded that fragile X syndrome was ruled out of families with consanguineous parents. Instead, fragile X syndrome could be contributed to earlier carrier detection, which may reduce the number of affected children. By isolating the mutation early, the effects of the disease could be reduced in children and in their development.  Discoveries of Genetic Mutations  = Discovery of Inactivating Mutations in the gene Branched Chain Ketoacid Dehydrogenase Kinase = Meguid discovered mutations in the gene Branched Chain Ketoacid Dehydrogenase Kinase (BCKDK). Mutations found in BCKDK were found in consanguineous families with epilepsy, autism, and intellectual disabilities. Previously, the BCKDK was known to cause Maple Syrup Urine disease (MSUD). Mutations in this gene could potentially treat autism and epilepsy. The protein is capable of phosphorylation-mediated inactivation of E1Œ± subunit of branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH). If a patient has a homozygous mutation (an identical mutation in both paternal and maternal alleles), then reductions are induced in BCKDK messenger RNA and protein, E1Œ± phosphorylation, and amino acids of the plasma membrane. = Recessive Non-syndromic Deafness: Mutation in GJB2 gene = Meguid described a new mutation for the GJB2 gene ( a gene responsible for recessive non- syndromic deafness) with a deletion of thymine (T) at the position 59 (c.59delT) in the intracellular domain of connexin 26.Meguid, Nagwa; Omran, Motaza; Ghorab, Iman; Dardir, Ahmed; Ragaa, Ehab; Helal, Suzette; Anwar, Mona.

She is the Javanese noblewoman through her grandfather, a Surakarta-based Javanese king, Mangkunegara VII. She is married to the business tycoon, Edward Soeryadjaya, son of the founder of Astra International, William Soeryadjaya. Early years Born Bandara Raden Ayu Atilah Rapatriatias one of the granddaughters of the Surakarta-based Javanese king, Mangkunegara VII and raised in the royal court, Atilah has ancient Javanese traditions and culture running deep in her veins. However, as a teenager, she took an interest in modern modeling, singing, and dancing, and decided to pursue language and contemporary arts in Germany after graduating from high school. She ended up in a music company, touring for years in Europe in 1980, while still studying music and contemporary dance. She attended the Tourism School of Jakarta (Sekolah Pariwisata Jakarta ). Career When she read a Singapore news story that dubbed her ancestral home, Solo, as a paradise for Islamic terrorism. Surakarta, after terrorist leader Noordin Mohammad Top had been killed in his hiding place in the city in 2009, Soeryadjaya determined to restore her hometown's image. She then decided to stage a Javanese sendratari drama Matah Ati show it to the rest of the world as the true image of Solo and to hold the play in Singapore, where it could attract more of a global audience. Matah Ati was staged in the Esplanade, Singapore concert hall from 22 to 23 October 2010, and was successful in Singapore. The idea of Matah Ati, came after she witnessed the staging of the musical Miss Saigon in the same theatre. She immediately returned to Solo and work hard to realize her dream, raise the culture of Indonesia in that prestigious stage. In preparation for Matah Ati, she joined dancers, choreographers, and court musicians to work long hours with her team in Surakarta, combining the contemporary with classical Javanese dance and music, with the help of modern technology. Matah Ati tells of the life of Rubiah, who became Raden Ayu Kusuma Matah Ati after tying the knot with the first Mangkunegaran king Raden Mas Said, and portrays her as a strong Javanese female. Rubiah was the leader of a 40-strong group of Javanese female warriors. - Luckily for her, husband of Chinese descent also support it. The success of Matah Ati in Esplanade, Singapore attract Federation for Asian Cultural Promotion (FACP), an institution that promotes the culture of Asia- Pacific countries. Because, for 25 years no cultural activities held in Indonesia, the country which is actually very rich in cultural diversity. Thanks to Matah Ati, Indonesia also accepted as a member of FACP back even chosen to host the FACP Conference, from 6 to 9 September. It held in Solo, the hometown of Atilah. Atilah also nominated it as a candidate to host the Solo FACP Conference. Not in vain, Solo was chosen to host and defeated a larger city, Beijing which is also nominated. As a gift to the citizens of Solo, during the event of FACP Conference which followed by 500 participants from 30 countries, the Matah Ati staged every day for free. One year later, in 2013, Soeryadjaja‚Äôs colossal play be staged at the Monumen Nasional, just in time to celebrate Jakarta‚Äôs 486th anniversary. The play, titled Ariah, was not planned to be her second production after the successful epic Javanese play Matah Ati. Ariah will involve at least 300 dancers and musicians, performing on a 3,456-square-meter-wide stage comprising three different heights of 3, 7 and 10 meters. A total of 15,000 spectators are expected for the show, set to be performed from June 28 to June 30. Ariah is based on the legendary tale of Ariah, a Betawi (native Jakartan) female warrior who stepped up against her Dutch oppressors and led fellow farmers in a violent revolt against the colonialists in 1869, when Jakarta was still known as Batavia. The plot of the musical is also inspired by the historic rivalry between the notorious playboy Oey Tamba Sia (1827-1856) and Tan Eng Goan, first Majoor der Chinezen of Batavia (1802-1872), as well as the latter's son-in-law, Lim Soe Keng Sia. Personal life In 1998, she married her second husband, business tycoon Edward Soeryadjaya, son of William Soeryadjaya and later helped with his business. Atilah enjoys Rock music and is a fan of top Indonesian bands of the 70s: God Bless and AKA. In her room, Atilah even put up the posters of AKA's singer who is now deceased, Ucok Harahap.

Foundation The first Shint≈çh≈ç, or \\"New Toho\\", also known as , was formed as an offshoot of the Toho Company after World War II. When this company went bankrupt in May 1961, two new companies were created in its place. Shint≈çh≈ç's former president, Mitsuru ≈åkura, formed the ≈åkura Eiga studio (later OP Eiga) after buying the Shint≈çh≈ç production facilities in Setagaya, Tokyo while K≈çichi Got≈ç, a Shint≈çh≈ç employee at the company's Kansai sales office in Osaka, bought the rights to the name of the company. Three years later, in 1964, the 33-year-old Got≈ç used borrowed money to buy the management rights to the section in Osaka where he had previously worked. He named his new company Shint≈çh≈ç K≈çgy≈ç () or \\"Shintoho Entertainment\\". In 1972, this company moved to Tokyo and absorbed another piece of the former Shint≈çh≈ç Company (Tokyo K≈çei) to become Shint≈çh≈ç Eiga (). After relocating to Tokyo, president K≈çichi Got≈ç and his staff shared offices with Kokuei, the earliest pink film production company.Sharp, p. 204 In this early period, the company mostly distributed films from other production studios, either those produced by the original Shint≈çh≈ç or bought from other independent studios, but it also began to produce its own films.Sharp, p. 203-204 Among these early films was the sadomasochistic April 1968 Absolutely Secret: Girl Torture produced by Tokyo K≈çei and featuring future pink film superstar Naomi Tani.Sharp, p. 348 Another early work was the September 1968 release Love Hotel directed by Shin'ya Yamamoto (director) and also produced by Tokyo K≈çei.Weisser, p. 251-252 A further group of early movies came from director Kiyoshi Komori who had been directing mainstream films for the original Shint≈çh≈ç since 1953 but when that company dissolved, began directing pink films for Shint≈çh≈ç Eiga. Komori made a number of films distributed by Shint≈çh≈ç from 1964 until his retirement from pink film in the mid 1970s.Weisser, p. 285 The 1970s After absorbing Tokyo K≈çei and moving to Tokyo, Shint≈çh≈ç began a period of rapid expansion. To compete with OP Eiga and its distribution network, Shint≈çh≈ç began its own theater network, partnering with Kokuei, Nihon Cinema and Aoi Eiga. The years 1972-1976 constituted the peak years for Shint≈çh≈ç when it produced some 60 films a year. One of the directors working with Shint≈çh≈ç during this period was K≈çji Wakamatsu who made a number of S&M; themed pink films for the studio including the 1975 Pornographic Casebook: Sexual Darkness and the 1976 Women Cruelty Dark Chronicles.Sharp, p. 120, 364-365 Two other torture-filled works from Wakamatsu from this time are Torture Chronicles: 100 Years (1975) and its 1977 sequel Torture Chronicles Continues: 100 Years.Weisser, p. 439-440 Toward the end of the decade, Shint≈çh≈ç released the June 1979 Mamoru Watanabe Meiji period film . The movie won the Best Film award at the Zoom-Up Film Festival () while Watanabe took the Best Director award.Sharp, p.211-212, p. 366 The 1980s The decade of the 1980s was a difficult one for the pink film industry generally, a combination of the advent of adult videos (AV) in 1981 and strict new government rules for theatrical films in 1984 caused a plunge in box office revenues.Weisser, p. 27-29 In order to compete with early AVs, which had taken a substantial portion of the adult entertainment market, Shint≈çh≈ç transferred some of their films to video and began shooting new material directly on video. However, the pink film studios had trouble competing with the low budget videos produced by the new AV companies which also had the advantage of using real sex (though censored) in their productions. Shint≈çh≈ç also kept up its output of pink film as well. Especially popular was director Y≈çjir≈ç Takita's series featuring Detective Kuroda and his side-kick Hamako which began with the 1982 Molester's Train: Please Continue and ended eleven films later in 1985 with Molester's Train: 1 Centimeter From the Wall. The studio also released other entries in the series with different characters and by different directors, chiefly Minoru Inao (1983-1984) and Masahiro Kasai (1988-1991).Weisser, p. 276-279 One of Kasai's films won the Best Film Third Place award and Kasai took one of Best New Director prizes at the first Pink Grand Prix in 1988. As part of its Roman porno films, Nikkatsu started a Female Teacher series in 1977 based on sex and rape in the classroom. When Nikkatsu discontinued the series in 1983 due to complaints from teachers and the Japanese government, Shint≈çh≈ç stepped in with the 1983 .Weisser, p. 148-150 Another significant series for Shint≈çh≈ç was the \\"Detective With Sunglasses\\" set of hardboiled action films directed by Yoshiho Fukuoka which featured actor Shir≈ç Shimomoto as the ultra-hip Detective Eiji. The first film in the series was the 1983 , followed by the 1985 and the 1987 . According to the Weissers, the series declined in quality and popularity after the first entry.Weisser, p. 116 The 1990s The 1990s saw a further decline in the pink film industry; Nikkatsu had released its last Roman porno film in 1988, and the company declared bankruptcy in 1993. However, the pink film was still being produced in large quantities and actually increased its share of total Japanese film production. In fact, Shint≈çh≈ç president K≈çichi Got≈ç was able to report that 1991-92 was the most profitable year in the company's history.Sharp p. 249 Of the new generation of directors from this period, often called (sometimes derisively) the \\"Four Heavenly Kings\\", one in particular, Hisayasu Sat≈ç, made a number of prominent films released by Shint≈çh≈ç starting in the late 1980s.Sharp, p. 356-358 His 1990 film, named Poaching By The Water by the director, with its themes of forced sex and bestiality, caused a good deal of controversy and scandal. Shint≈çh≈ç helped this along by renaming the film Horse and Woman and DogWeisser, p. 469 and according to the company's website, it became one of their all-time hits. When Shint≈çh≈ç decided to resurrect the Molester Train series originally started at the studio by director Y≈çjir≈ç Takita in 1982, they chose Sat≈ç to direct the 1993 installment Molester's Train: Nasty Behavior.Weisser, p. 476 The film starred AV idol Yumika Hayashi and it was named the second best film at the Pink Grand Prix festival. Shint≈çh≈ç moved into video production again in 1992 with their \\"Hard Porno\\" line of S&M; videos beginning with a series of films from the 1970s which had been sold to the studio by director Koji Wakamatsu.Weisser, p. 97 The company celebrated its 30-year anniversary in 1993 with the release of , a film described by general manager Akira Mori as \\"something akin to a pink-tinged version of a historical epic.\\" The movie, directed by Minoru Inao and written by Takahisa Zeze, had double the budget of a standard pink film and featured actress Yumika Hayashi and actor Shinji Kubo. In 1994, the studio released the Kokuei produced film Keep on Masturbating: Non-Stop Pleasure from director Toshiya Ueno which, in addition to winning Best Film of the year at the 1994 Pink Grand Prix, also brought awards to director Ueno, screenwriter Takahisa Zeze, and actors Takeshi It≈ç and Hotaru Hazuki. Jasper Sharp calls this \\"one of Ueno's most accomplished films\\" and posits the work as a lead-in to the next generation of Japanese pink film directors known as \\"The Seven Lucky Gods.\\"Sharp p. 311 The 2000s and beyond At the beginning of the 21st century, only five pink film production companies were still operating in Japan. In addition to Shint≈çh≈ç, the existing studios were Kokuei (which distributes its films through Shint≈çh≈ç), OP Eiga, Xces, and ENK which produces gay-themed films.Sharp, p. 10 Despite the decline in studios, pink films were still a significant force in Japanese cinema, and of the 287 films released in Japan in 2003, 89 were pink films. In 2004, the studio released Tsumugi which marked the pink film debut of AV Idol and actress Sora Aoi. The film won the fourth place Best Film Award at the 2004 Pink Grand Prix and Aoi took a Best New Actress award. The \\"Molester Train\\" series, begun in 1982, was re-invented once again in 2005 when Shint≈çh≈ç produced Molester's Train: Suggestive Indecent Hips by director Naoyuki Tomomatsu. The film won the 3rd place Best Film award at that year's Pink Grand Prix.

SNU Law is widely considered to be the most prestigious law school in South Korea. Founded in 2009, it is one of the founding law schools of South Korea and currently offers the J.D., J.S.D., LL.M., and Ph.D. degrees in law. Due to the establishment of the graduate J.D. program, the law school no longer admits undergraduate law students. The LL.B. program will be gradually phased out in favor of the Law School's graduate programs. SNU Law currently enrolls 150 students in each class of the J.D. program.  History  The law school was established in its first iteration in 1895 during the Joseon Dynasty as the Judicial Officials Training Institute. Following the Gabo Reform, intended to be a sweeping reform of the Korean government, then- minister of justice Suh Kwangbom proposed creating and institution to educate judicial law. Initially, the institute served men between the ages of 25 and 30, and granted a bachelor of law. In 1909, the institute was restructured, becoming a law school and a limited professional school. In 1911, the name and setup was again changed, and the school became Seoul Professional School. However, in 1922 it returned to being exclusively a law school, and the name was once again changed to Seoul Professional Law School. In the early 1940s, the law school was forced to cease admitting new students due to harsh wartime policies enacted by the Japanese; however, this policies were reverted following the end of the war, and enrollment returned to normal levels. Following the April Revolution, a student-led revolution which would lead to the end of the autocratic regime of Syngman Ree, enrollment was sharply and suddenly reduced by the government from three hundred students to one hundred and sixty, based on its assumption that the law school was the center of the protests. Enrollment stayed at this level until recovering in 1981.  Library Established in August 1946, the Seoul National University Law Library opened on June 30, 2014. It currently holds more than 155,055 volumes in its collection.

The name Babibasiliscus comes from the Shoshoni word babi, meaning \\"older male cousin\\", and Basiliscus, a modern-day genus of casquehead lizards. The specimen is undeformed and nearly complete except for the tip of the snout and the top of the skull, making it unclear whether the distinctive bony crest of living corytophanids was present in prehistoric relatives like Babibasiliscus. The skull is about in length and the entire body is estimated to have been about long. Bones on the right side of lower jaw of the specimen are thickened and fused together, suggesting that the jaw had broken and healed when the animal was alive. Babibasiliscus occurs farther north than any living genus of corytophanid. During the Eocene temperatures in what is now Wyoming were about warmer than they are today, and the region was likely covered by a tropical forest based on other Eocene fossil assemblages known from western North America. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Babibasiliscus is deeply nested within Corytophanidae as the sister taxon of the living genus Laemanctus.

Bajekal, 'Inside Calais's Deadly Migrant Crisis (01/08/15) in Time seeking to enter the United Kingdom from the French port by crossing the Channel Tunnel or stowing away in the cargo area of lorries heading for ferries that cross the English Channel. During this time, informal camps of migrants have formed, the most notorious commonly referred to as the Calais Jungle. Other migrants come to the area because they are homeless while seeking asylum in France. The presence of migrants in and around Calais has affected the British and French governments, the Eurotunnel and P&O; Ferries companies, and lorry drivers heading for the UK and their companies. EuroTunnel (now Getlink), the company that operates the Channel Tunnel, said that it intercepted more than 37,000 migrants between January and July 2015.  Migrant population   Demographics  A young migrant dribbling a ball at the camp during October 2015 The migrant population around Calais has changed over time as global crises have changed. In the late 1990s, for instance, most people had travelled to the area to escape conflict in the Balkans. Nearly two decades later Kurdish Iraqis were the largest group, but by 2014 many people had begun to arrive from the Horn of Africa and Sudan.Calais 'Jungle': Migrants hit dead end in journey to UK Fergal Keane, BBC News, 9 October 2014. Retrieved 24 June 2015. Many of the Kurdish Iraqis later moved to similar camps near Calais and Dunkirk. Prior to the eviction of the large Jungle camp, a July 2016 survey of the population of the Calais Jungle by Help Refugees counted 7,307 migrants (of which 761 were minors): the largest number to date. At that time, the population was increasing by an average of 50 people per day. After the Brexit vote on 23 June 2016, the population had reportedly increased to nearly 10,000. An estimated 62% of the migrants were young men; the migrants' average age was 33. Most of them do not speak French.  Motivation  Calais is the closest geographical point to the UK in mainland Europe. It is a significant trade hub, with millions of tons of goods passing through each day, to and from Great Britain, by truck, train, and ship. This increases the potential for migrants to stow away on vehicles passing through, as well as the economic costs of the disruption that they cause. Migrants in the area who want to reach the UK do so for a number of reasons. For instance, some prefer the UK to other European countries due to greater economic growth, and the relative ease of finding undocumented work,Migrant squalor in Calais 'jungle'.

(24/10/16) in HuffPost Some migrants in the area have paid smugglers - sometimes thousands of pounds - to help them on their journey and/or to help them attempt to reach the UK. Migrants risk their lives when they try to climb aboard or travel on vehicles, occasionally falling off and injuring themselves or dying. Not every migrant in Calais is trying to get to the UK, however: some are seeking asylum in France but are homeless because the French system does not provide for them while their claim is being processed.Francesca Ansaloni, 'Deterritorialising the Jungle: Understanding the Calais camp through its orderings' in Environment and Planning C: Politics and Space (25/02/20) doi.org/10.1177/2399654420908597  Conditions  Apart from the camp in Sangatte (closed 2002) and the one in Grande-Synthe during the mayoral administration of Damien Car√™me, the camps are informal and have appeared in various locations along the northern coast since the 1990s.

Charrier, '√Ä Calais, des associations d√©noncent un arr√™t√© municipal ¬´ stigmatisant ¬ª envers les migrants' (01/11/19) in La Croix  Reactions   Legal framework  = Treaties = The laws for processing of migrants and management of the situation are set by European Union agreements while the UK remains in the European Union (EU), and by bilateral agreements between the UK and France relating to the Channel Tunnel. As the UK opted out of the Schengen Agreement, it is not obligated to eliminate border controls between itself and other EU countries, leading to the accumulation of the migrants in Calais. Bilateral agreements include the 1991 Sangatte Protocol regarding border controls in Coquelles and Folkestone, which was later supplemented by the 2003 Touquet Treaty, which increased the powers of the police at the border, and defines the obligations of the UK and France to accept refugees. = French rule of law = When the French justice system determines that a person is in France illegally, an OQTF (obligation de quitter le territoire fran√ßais) - an order to leave France or be deported to a country of origin - can be issued. This is defined in the CESEDA law (Code de l'entr√©e et du s√©jour des √©trangers et du droit d'asile). However, many of the camps' inhabitants lack identification and even a legal identity in their countries of origin, as is the case with many people of Eritrean, Ethiopian, and Sudanese nationality. For a person in this situation, an OQTF cannot be issued, either because it is unclear to what country the person should be deported, or because neither their countries of origin nor other countries in the Schengen Area will accept them. = Security measures = Fencing in Calais Britain and France operate a system of juxtaposed controls on immigration and customs, whereby border checks take place prior to boarding, so once stowaways are in a vehicle in the tunnel, they are able to enter the UK without further checks. To discourage vehicle operators from facilitating this, lorry drivers are fined ¬£2,000 per stowaway, if a migrant is discovered in their vehicle. On 20 August 2015, Theresa May, who was then UK Home Secretary, arrived in Calais with Bernard Cazeneuve, the French Minister of the Interior, to confirm a new agreement to address the situation. The agreement invested ¬£7 million in new security measures, including basing British police officers in a new control centre in Calais that regularly reported to May and Cazeneuve regarding immigration-related criminal activities on both sides of the Channel. The port of Calais is protected by 5-meter tall fences topped with coils of razor wire and surveillance cameras. Additional fencing is being constructed along the motorway leading to the port. The UK is investing ¬£3 million in heartbeat and carbon dioxide detectors, and dog searches, for UK-bound lorries in France. Emmanuel Macron, the President of France, has called for the situation to be address through more security at the periphery of the European Union to prevent people from entering the EU irregularly.  Other political reactions  In August 2015, Vincent Cochetel, the director for Europe at the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, described the crisis as a \\"civil emergency\\". Later that month, Yvette Cooper, the UK Shadow Home Secretary, said that the United Nations had to intervene in the crisis in order to stop the French government from allowing people to try to enter the UK illegally, and on 20 August, Theresa May, then the UK Home Secretary, expressed concern that the crisis could spread to other ports, such as Dunkirk. In 2015, Nigel Farage, at the time leader of the U.K. Independence Party (UKIP), called for the military to search incoming vehicles to address a \\"lawless, scary\\" situation.

History   Sangatte migrants camp (1999‚Äì2002)  In the late 1990s growing numbers of migrants, including women and children, were sleeping in the streets of Calais and surrounding towns. Most were hoping to enter the UK, either through the Channel Tunnel under, or by the P&O; Ferries over the English Channel.'Sangatte refugee camp'. The Guardian, 23 May 2002. Retrieved 22 June 2015. In 1999, at the request of the French government, the French Red Cross opened a refugee camp in Sangatte in a giant warehouse about from the entrance to the Channel Tunnel. Sangatte was planned to house 600 people, but by 2002 it held 2,000.‚Äò'At night it‚Äôs like a horror movie' ‚Äì inside Calais's official shantytown‚Äô. The Guardian, 6 April 2015. Retrieved 22 June 2015. living in squalid conditions. Tensions between ethnic groups in Sangatte for the best places from which to board trains at the Fr√©thun EuroTunnel rail freight terminal grew, as it was from Calais. EuroTunnel stated in 2001 that they were stopping 200 refugees each night, mostly from Sangatte, who aimed to smuggle themselves into Britain, and called on France to shut the camp. On Christmas Day 2001, a large group of people broke through all security barriers, and 500 of them stormed the Channel Tunnel. By 2002, the Eurotunnel company had spent ¬£6 million (‚Ç¨8 million) on security measures around the terminal site, such as fences, razor wire, cameras, and 360 security guards patrolling daily. On 3 December 2002, the French Minister of the Interior, Nicolas Sarkozy, announced the definitive closure of the camp at Sangatte on 30 December 2002, in exchange for the promise of the British government to accept 1,000 Kurdish refugees and some 250 Afghans, who would all receive a work permit for three months, which dealt with 80% of the refugees and migrants in Sangatte at that time. The remaining people received a residence permit in France.‚ÄòSangatte : fermeture anticip√©e‚Äô [S.: advanced closure]. Radio France Internationale, 3 December 2002. Retrieved 27 June 2015.  Various 'jungle' camps (2002‚Äì2014)  Since 2002, migrants in Calais slept in squats, slums and outdoor camps known as \\"jungles\\" that were repeatedly raided or bulldozed by police before cropping up elsewhere, and they ate from charity soup kitchens. Migrants caught during an attempt to hide aboard a lorry would be taken to the police station, where they would receive a warning and be released. In 2009, the UN Refugee Agency set up a permanent office in Calais to offer asylum advice to migrants. In April 2009, the police raided and bulldozed a camp and arrested 190 migrants. This camp, in the woods around Calais, was reestablished, with tents made out of metal grilles and plastic sheeting and wooden shelters, housing 700‚Äì800 mainly Afghan migrants. It was unsanitary. It was raided again in September 2009, and 276 protesting migrants were arrested and put on buses. Bulldozers were expected to destroy their shelters later that day. The jungle inhabitants were partly imprisoned at the nearby Centre de R√©tention of Coquelles; many more were taken to detention centres all over France before being released and making the journey back to Calais by foot. After the closing of this camp, the French authorities threatened to repatriate \\"sans-papiers\\" (\\"immigr√©s en situation irr√©guli√®re\\") to Afghanistan. In July 2014, the French police once again expelled migrants from a camp in Calais. = Rushes on Channel ferries (2014) = By September 2014, some 1,200 to 1,500 migrants,‚ÄòCalais mayor threatens to block port if UK fails to help deal with migrants‚Äô.

Charity workers said that 100 people in the \\"new jungle\\" had already claimed asylum in France but still had no accommodation. A camp has also sprung up in Dunkirk, around 40 km from Calais. Most of the migrants were Kurdish Iraqis. In early June 2015, the police dismantled some smaller encampments in Calais. By mid-June, the city council of Calais estimated 3,000 migrants to be living in encampments.Le Monde, 18 June 2015. As of November 2015, there were an estimated 6,000 migrants living in the camp. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, ten people had died trying to cross the Channel Tunnel since the start of June 2015. As of October 2016, just prior to its dismantling, 'Help Refugees' put the number in the camp at 8,143. Starting on 24 October 2016, the French government planned to evacuate 6,400 migrants from the encampment in 170 buses with the intent of resettling the migrants in different regions of France. On 26 October 2016, French authorities announced that the camp had been cleared of all migrants.  Truck driver attacks (2015‚Äìpresent)  Since the start of the European migrant crisis, truck drivers heading for the UK have been threatened and attacked by people trying to reach the UK. In December 2015, 13 trucks were hit with stones, with people trying to jump into trucks from motorway overpasses. In March 2016, a truck driver was assaulted, sustaining minor injuries, while his truck was also damaged. In August 2016, a driver was threatened with a chainsaw by those wishing to board trucks to the UK. Truck drivers have also violently confronted people found stowed away in their trucks, and one Hungarian truck driver filmed how he directed his truck towards a group of people that hurled rocks at his truck, only to swerve away from them as part of an intimidation tactic. The first death was recorded on 20 June 2017, when people trying to reach the UK stopped a lorry on the A16 autoroute with a tree trunk, in order to stowaway in the cargo area. A van registered in Poland hit the lorry and burst into fire, killing the van driver. Nine people from Eritrea were arrested in connection with the incident. In July 2017 a lorry driver was attacked with a brick after stepping out of the cab to confront people trying to leave France. After leaving the driver unconscious on the side of the road, they attempted to drive the lorry towards the port before being apprehended several miles away. = Calais blockade = The Calais blockade was a 2016 protest in France in response to the Calais Jungle. Lorry drivers and farmers used their vehicles on the A16 motorway to slow down entry to the Port of Calais. The camp had become the focal point of France's migrant crisis, with about 7,000 people, mainly from the Middle East, Afghanistan and Africa, living there. The protest also attracted a number of local trade unions and Calais protestors. The protest calls for the closure and removal of the camp. The president of the Association of Calais Traders said \\"We will not budge from the motorway until the state gives us the dates for the total demolition of the northern zone of the Jungle.\\" This protest marks the first time the Association of Calais Traders has taken a physical approach to protesting the migrant camp.  Since the demolition of the Jungle (2016-present)  Since the demolition of the large Jungle camp in 2016 there has been an administrative policy of \\"no fixation points\\" for migrants to settle in, aiming to stop another large camp from forming. Police, including the Compagnies R√©publicaines de S√©curit√© (CRS), and clearance teams regularly evict migrants from their makeshift camps with new encampments later forming in another or the same location. The encampments are dangerous due to exposure and poor living conditions resulting in health difficulties. A hostile environment is created for the migrants, with migrants and NGOs reporting violence from the police directed at migrants and the local administration occasionally banning the distribution of food and water to migrants.  Migrant sites in France outside Calais  Other smaller, migrant sites exist in France outside Calais. The Association Terre d'Errance estimates that eleven camps exist in the northern part of the country.Philip Kleinfeld (31 August 2015) France: Where refugees go to avoid 'the jungle', Al Jazeera. The largest of these is the Grande-Synthe site near Dunkirk. On that site, in the first and older camp of Basroch refugee camp, migrants (mostly Iraqi Kurdish families) lived under deplorable conditions on a boggy wasteland site, without adequate sanitation facilities or shelter. The site was cited as being worse than Calais.Yvette Cooper, The most shocking thing about Calais is that it's not even too big to solve, The Guardian (7 January 2016).Henry Samuel, France's first ever internationally recognised refugee camp opens near Dunkirk, The Daily Telegraph (7 March 2016).

A total capacity of 2,500 people was expected. Traffickers sexually abused migrants, both women and children, by raping them in exchange for blankets, food or opportunity to get to the UK.

It was one of two banks that served Lehigh during the town's mining boom. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.State Historic Preservation Office: Oklahoma Historical Society.Oklahoma's National Register Handbook. April 1, 2015. Accessed July 2, 2015.\\"State Sites Placed on Register,\\" The Oklahoman, February 17, 2007. It is historically significant because it represents the economic growth and decline of Lehigh and exemplifies Late Victorian Renaissance architecture. History During the late-19th and early-20th centuries, Lehigh was a prosperous community due to the high demand for coal from mines in Coal County. The Merchants National Bank was founded in 1906. It was the second bank in Lehigh; the Lehigh National Bank, founded in 1898, was the first. Merchants National Bank operated out of a temporary headquarters for the first several months of its operation. On January 29, 1907, it was announced that the constructing contract for the bank's building had been awarded to Faudree Brothers of Atoka, Oklahoma. The new bank was built on the southwest corner of Katy Avenue and Main Street, and it was, architecturally, one of the most striking buildings in town. At the time it was built, the bank was located in Atoka County, a part of the Pushmataha District of the Choctaw Nation.Morris, John W. Historical Atlas of Oklahoma (Norman: University of Oklahoma, 1986), plate 38. The coal boom ended in the 1910s, as railroads switched to cheaper fuel oil to power their trains. In the early 1920s, the railroads closed their mines in Lehigh. Declining crop prices and damage to the cotton crop from boll weevils further weakened the economy. The Merchants National Bank closed in 1923. The building subsequently housed a grocery store. Many of the other buildings on main street were abandoned. As part of New Deal projects during the Great Depression, most of the abandoned buildings on Main Street were torn down. During World War II, there was again a demand for coal in the area, and many of the town's buildings were torn down or moved so the ground underneath them could be readily mined. By the 1980s, the grocery store in the Merchants National Bank Building had closed, and the building had deteriorated and been damaged by vandals. In the 1980s, the Lehigh Historical Society completed restoration work on the building.Caruthers, Lorene. \\"Lehigh,\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture, Oklahoma Historical Society, Accessed July 4, 2015. They replaced most of the windows and repaired the roof, ceilings, and floors. The building is the only remaining commercial building in what was once downtown Lehigh. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. Architecture The building is two stories high and made of red brick with cream brick highlights. It measured 34 by 70 feet, with the short side facing Main Street and the long side facing Railroad Street. It is in the Late Victorian Renaissance style. At the northwest corner, there is a pyramidal tower with a steeply pitched roof and a short, rounded spire. Along the roof of the building, there is a brick parapet on the north and east sides with a sandstone capstone and eight pilasters. The west side of the building has no windows and an unadorned parapet because the west wall was a party wall for the adjacent building. The building has arched windows framed in buff bricks. It has a recessed corner entrance, which is supported by a red granite column on a sandstone pier. The entryway is arch-shaped, and the arch is filled in with decorated wrought iron in a fan-shaped design. The first floor of the building contains the original banking room, which has a pressed tin ceiling, stained oak door and window surrounds, and keystones above the window arches. It has a poured concrete floor, which replaced the original floor, which had been damaged by rot. The plaster walls have been covered by fiberboard.

It is best remembered for being the A-side to Hank Williams' #1 hit \\"Cold, Cold Heart\\" in 1951 for MGM Records. Background According to Colin Escott's 2004 biography of Hank Williams, producer Fred Rose initially saw \\"Cold, Cold Heart\\" as a B-side and regarded \\"Dear John\\" a more appropriate A-side, since jukeboxes preferred up-tempo singles. The song was originally recorded by Jim Boyd, younger brother of Dallas-based western swing artist Bill Boyd. Eventually Tex Ritter got a credit on the song likely after promising songwriter Aubrey Gass he would get the song cut by a big name or get Gass a contract with his label Capitol if he got a piece of the composition. Williams recorded the song at the same session that he cut \\"Cold, Cold Heart,\\" with Fred Rose producing and backing from Jerry Rivers (fiddle), Don Helms (steel guitar), Sammy Pruett (electric guitar), Chet Atkins (rhythm guitar), and Ernie Newton or \\"Cedric Rainwater,\\" aka Howard Watts (bass). As Escott observes: \\"When Hank and the band hollered the tag line, 'Dear John, I've sent your saddle home,' it invited everyone in the bar, the auditorium, or even the car to holler right along. Once again, the upfront rhythm guitar carried the recording. Hank cruised at the brisk tempo, never once straining.\\" \\"Cold, Cold Heart\\" shot to #1 in early 1951, and \\"Dear John\\" rode on its coattails to #8 on the Billboard country singles chart. In 1996, ‚ÄúDear John‚Äù was referenced by Tracy Lawrence‚Äôs single ‚ÄúTime Marches On‚Äù, featuring the lyrics ‚ÄúHank Williams sings ‚ÄòKaw-Liga‚Äô and ‚ÄòDear John‚Äô and time marches on.‚Äù ‚ÄúTime Marches On‚Äù held the number one spot on Billboard‚Äôs Hot Country Songs chart for three weeks.

The house then passed to Ralph Verney, 2nd Earl Verney before it was acquired, on Verney's death in 1791, by George Morgan, who was High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire. The house remained in the ownership of the Morgan and then the Morgan-Grenville family for most of the 19th century. It was bought by Lieutenant Colonel Reginald Badger in around 1932 and then remained in the Badger family for many years before passing to Mrs. Elizabeth Maud Gordon. It was then comprehensively renovated in the 1980s. The church of St Margaret of Scotland is situated in the grounds of Biddlesden Park.

After the huge successes of Osborne's previous plays Look Back in Anger and The Entertainer, the play was to become \\"one of the most spectacular disasters in English theatre\\".Heilpern, John, John Osborne: A Patriot for Us, 2007, Random House, pp.249-54. Creation The play was based on an earlier unproduced drama called An Artificial Comedy, or Love in a Myth, which had been turned down for production by both George Devine and Tony Richardson. Osborne adapted it to become a musical, with deliberately \\"cartoon characters\\". The adapted version was produced by Donald Albery. Osborne directed. The music for the songs was written by Christopher Whelen, an established composer of incidental music for theatre. The lyrics were by Osborne. Hugh Casson designed the set. Kenneth MacMillan choreographed the dance sequences.MacMillan: Choreographer The play's central character, Paul Slickey, was based on gossip columnist William Hickey. Plot Journalist Jack Oakham uses the pseudonym Paul Slickey for his gossip column in which he takes swipes at the lifestyles of the rich and famous. He explores the lives of troubled couple Lesley and Michael, rich, young people who propose to solve their marriage problems by both having sex changes. He also follows the hopelessly archaic aristocrats Lord and Lady Mortlake and the Giltedge-Whytes, along with brash young pop star Terry Maroon. As the empty and silly lives of the people he covers start to affect him, Jack finds it increasingly difficult to do his job, and his own marriage suffers. Production The play was a critical disaster. On the opening night, the audience booed at the end, and one of the cast, Adrienne Corri, made V signs at the audience and told them \\"go fuck yourselves\\". Among the booing members of the audience were John Gielgud and No√´l Coward, who later wrote in his diary \\"never in all my theatrical experience have I seen anything so appalling, appalling from every point of view\\". As Osborne left the theatre, he was chased by \\"furious theatregoers\\" down Charing Cross Road. The play closed after six weeks. Reception Critics were overwhelmingly negative. It was described as \\"the biggest floperoo ever‚Äù, an ‚Äúevening of general embarrassment‚Äù, and a ‚Äúsad day for Osborne‚Äù. According to The Times it exuded \\"extraordinary dullness\\", and the Evening Standard stated that it was \\"incredibly naive and dull\\". Dancing Times was positive about some of Kenneth MacMillan's work, calling the sequence ‚ÄòOn Ice‚Äô \\"a clever satire on smart women journalists, inspired by those absurd attitudes struck by models on the fashion pages of the glossy weeklies\\", but it objected to another as ‚Äúa nightmare ritual taking the form of a rowdy alcoholic rock‚Äôn‚Äôroll orgy\\".

Eystein was among those to accompany Harald in his invasion of England in 1066. Harald and his army first encountered resistance at Scarborough, where the townsfolk refused to surrender. Harald resorted to burning down the town and this action led to other Northumbrian towns surrendering to him. The army sailed further down the Humber until they disembarked at Riccall. Harald's army then encountered the earls Morcar and Edwin, they fought against Harald's invading army two miles (3 km) south of York at the Battle of Fulford on 20 September. The battle was a decisive victory for the invaders, and led York to surrender to their forces on 24 September.DeVries (1999) pp. 250‚Äì261 Early on 25 September, King Harald and Tostig left for York again, leaving a third of their forces behind.

History Benjamin Franklin Smallwood was an important leader of the Choctaw. He was representative to the Choctaw nation from 1847 to 1887. As a representative, he held the office of speaker for many years and was the leader of the National Party. He was elected Principal Chief of Choctaw Nation in 1888 and served for two years as chief. Because he refused to meet with United States government officials unless they came to his home, his home was where important meetings of Choctaw legislators, religious leaders, and members of the United States Congress were held. The house was originally part of a 500-acre farm that included four mineral springs. In 1982, the house was added to the National Register of Historic Places. It is the last surviving structure associated with Smallwood. At the time it was built, the Smallwood House was located in Atoka County, a part of the Pushmataha District of the Choctaw Nation.Morris, John W.

He is best known for his expertise in the field of infectious and parasitic diseases, which led to advancements in malaria research in the 1960s and 70s. His name inspired the term, \\"yoelii,\\" the taxonomy of organisms with English names. Yoeli was also a professor at New York University, where he wrote scientific papers on the study of human malaria. Biography Yoeli was born on August 20, 1912 in Kaunas, Lithuania. He studied biology and medicine at the University of Kaunas and immigrated to Palestine in 1934. In 1937, Yoeli began studying medical and tropical medicine at the University of Padova in Italy. He received his M.D. in 1939 from the University of Basel. He was a medical officer in the British Royal Army Medical Corps during World War II stationed in North Africa. In 1948, Yoeli was the head of the department of preventive medicine for the Israeli Defense Forces during Israel's war for independence. He became a member of the faculty at New York University in 1956. Yoeli taught as a professor in the department of preventive medicine at the university's School of Medicine. From 1974-1975, Yoeli was the president of the New York Society of Tropical Medicine. He was also the author of numerous children's books in Hebrew under the pen name Meir Michaeli. He died in December 1975 at his home in New York. Research Yoeli is best known for his study and research of malaria at New York University. He developed the technique for testing rodent malaria parasites that was used on experimental research for chemotherapy and immunology. Before Yoeli's breakthrough, malaria research of parasites could only be done on human volunteers or monkeys. In 1974, Yoeli and his colleague, Bruce Hargreaves, discovered a mutant organism that causes cerebral malaria. Selected publications Yoeli published more than 130 scientific papers during his career. His research in the field of malaria was recognized internationally by the New York Academy of Science, the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene and others. * Yoeli, M. \\"Cerebral Malaria--The Quest for Suitable Experimental Models in Parasitic Diseases of Man.\\" Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg. 1976. * Yoeli, M. \\"Landmarks in Malaria Research.\\" Verlag f√ºr Recht und Gesellschaft.. 1974'' * Yoeli, M. \\"Sir Ronald Ross and the Evolution of Malaria Research.\\" New York Academy of Science. 1973. * Yoeli, M. \\"The Development of Malaria Research Before and Since Ronald Ross.\\" Munch Med Wochenschr. 1973. * Yoeli, M., Upmanisa, R., Most H. \\"Drug-resistance transfer among rodent plasmodia\\" Parasitology. 1969. * Yoeli, M. \\"Patterns of Immunity and Resistance in Rodent Malaria Infections\\" Bull Soc Pathol Exot Filiales. 1966.

Early life and education Grace Henry was born Emily Grace Mitchell at Kirktown St. Fergus, near Peterhead, Aberdeenshire on 10 February 1868. She was the ninth child of ten of the Rev. John Mitchell and Jane Mitchell (n√©e Gardner). Lord Byron was a cousin of her maternal grandmother. Henry was educated at home, spending time at the family's home in Piccadilly, where she experience London society. After the death of her father, and the reduced circumstances she found herself in, Henry left home in 1895 to pursue a career as an artist. The first record of her work being exhibited is with the Aberdeen Artists Society in 1896 and 1898. These paintings have not been traced since. In 1899 she left Scotland for the continent, visiting Holland and Belgium, studying at the Blanc‚ÄêGuerrins academy in Brussels. She went on to attend the Delacluze academy in Paris. Whilst in Paris, she met Paul Henry, an Irish artist, with the couple marrying in September 1903 in London. Artistic career The Henrys lived at a few different residences outside London until 1910. A small number of Henry's works are known from this time, such as The girl in white, which is in the collections of the Hugh Lane Gallery. This piece shows the influence of fellow artist James Abbott McNeill Whistler, whom she met in Paris through her husband. The couple travelled in Achill Island for the first time in 1910 which was intended to be a two-week stay, with the couple going on to live there until 1919. During this time, Henry painted numerous night scenes, including Achill cottages (Hugh Lane Gallery). A well known work by Henry is Top of the hill on display in the Limerick City Gallery of Art, which shows a group of island women. This period spent on the island did place a strain on the Henrys marriage, as Grace was not as happy living there. The couple returned to Dublin in 1919, and were founding members of the Society of Dublin Painters in 1920 alongside Letitia Marion Hamilton, Mary Swanzy, and Jack Butler Yeats. The Society offered an outlet for younger Irish artists to exhibit. Five of Henrys works were featured at the Irish Exhibition in Paris in 1922, and at a similar exhibition in Brussels in 1930. Around 1920, Grace had a romantic association with Stephen Gwynn who was an important political, cultural and literary figure from the lost world of late-nineteenth and early- twentieth century Ireland. During this period Grace went travelling with Gwynn in France and Italy and later painted a number of portraits of Gwynn. Invariably, during this time, the Henrys' marriage continued to have problems, with the couple breaking up in 1924. Grace's affair with Gwynn, who she depicted in two known oil paintings including 'The orange man' (Limerick City Gallery of Art) and 'Portrait of a man' which depicted a much more distinguished Gwynn in later life, contributed to the break up. The couple legally separated in 1930. Henry developed her own style through the 1920s and 1930s, spending time in France and Italy. She studied with Andr√© Lhote from 1924 to 1925, Lhote was a cubist painter who also worked with Mainie Jellett, Evie Hone, and Mary Swanzy. Henry went on to display little of his influence in her work. Henry painted in Venice and in the environs of the Italian lakes, painting with the fauvist style, with free brushwork and vibrant colours. Henry also experimented with expressionism, which can be seen in Spring in winter. Upon the outbreak of World War II, she returned to Ireland. Henry did not have a permanent residence during this period, instead she stayed with friends or lived in hotels. She also experienced periods of melancholy during these later years, though she continued to exhibit. Her work was regularly displayed at the Royal Hibernian Academy (RHA), and she had solo shows at the Waddington and Dawson galleries. Henry was made an honorary member of the RHA in 1949. Legacy Henry died in Dublin on 11 August 1953, and is buried at Mount Jerome Cemetery. During her career, and for a number of years after her death, Henry was largely overshadowed by her husband sometimes referred to as \\"Mrs Paul Henry\\". She was even omitted from Paul Henry's two-volume autobiography. Her body of work was re-examined in the 1970s, which led to wider public recognition and her inclusion in a number of exhibitions such as The paintings of Paul and Grace Henry at the Hugh Lane Gallery in 1991.

Early life Gloria grew up in a low-income household in the suburbs of Rio de Janeiro, with her father working as a tailor and her mother, a housewife. She was taught values of cleanliness and accountability. Gloria lived with her grandmother after her parents divorced. Gloria's grandmother told her stories about her great-grandfather who was hanged in the mountains of Minas Gerais state. Daughter of a slave mother, her grandmother was also a beneficiary of the 1871 Law of Free Birth and, thus, born free. Her grandmother taught her that she needed to work to be free and Gloria decided to focus on combatting racial prejudice. Career In January 2010, Gloria met with news directors of Globo TV and shortly after, Gloria would be the special reporter for the Globo Reporters. She still continues this position today, sometimes co-presenting alongside Sergio Chapelin. Gloria Maria is the first black television reporter in Brazil, the first to present the seven o‚Äôclock news, and the first to command Fant√°stico. However, Gloria had to face many barriers and obstacles to become a successful journalist and reporter. For a year, Gloria Maria worked two jobs, including weekends before she acquired a position at Globo. Gloria Maria started her shift at Globo at eight in the morning and left at eight in the evening. After, she went to pre- college prep courses and then go home to sleep for an hour. Gloria would wake up in the morning to go to her job at a telephone company. Gloria received her degree in journalism from the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro. After graduating, she went on the presenting news on several Globo TV programs such as RJTV, Jornal Nacional, and Fant√†stico. Soon after, Gloria became known for reports she would do while traveling to exotic places such as through the Sahara Desert and even covering events like the Falklands War in 1982. She hosted Fantastico for ten years and took a two tear sabbatical to travel to places like the Himalayas before returning and taking the second position as a Globo reporter. Gloria has accumulated more than ten complete passports throughout her career and has even received the honor of interviewing several famous people such as Michael Jackson, Madonna, and Freddie Mercury. Personal life Gloria was once married but separated because she didn't want to live together. Gloria also didn't consider having children but now she is a single mother of her daughters Laura and Maria whom she adopted as sisters from Salvador, Bahia, in 2009.

Mulloy, in an article in the \\"Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities\\" magazine: \\"Smoothing Data with Faster Moving Averages\\" It attempts to remove the inherent lag associated with Moving Averages by placing more weight on recent values. The name suggests this is achieved by applying a double exponential smoothing which is not the case. The name double comes from the fact that the value of an EMA (Exponential Moving Average) is doubled. To keep it in line with the actual data and to remove the lag the value \\"EMA of EMA\\" is subtracted from the previously doubled ema. The formula is: :textit{DEMA} = 2 times textit{EMA} - textit{EMA}(textit{EMA}) Because EMA(EMA) is used in the calculation, DEMA needs 2 √ó period - 1 samples to start producing values in contrast to the period samples needed by a regular EMA The same article also introduced another EMA related indicator: Triple exponential moving average (TEMA) As shown in the formula it reduces the weight on the recent values and by calculating ema of the ema we are trying to remove the weight on the long slower part of the average that has built up over time. It significantly helps make quicker decisions than the simple MA crossovers. Available on almost all the trading software now, it is much better than as it helps capture the trend earlier and make better decisions in the sense that helps one make better entry and exit points improving profitability.

Early life Hisham Ben Ghalbon was born in Benghazi in 1955. He studied at the city's Model Primary School then at Salah-Eddin High School before traveling to Tripoli to study Mechanical Engineering at the University of Tripoli. He was a keen horse rider and owner and was an active member in the Benghazi Riding Club since its 1969 foundation, where he won several trophies in local and national show jumping competitions. In Tripoli he took part in the April 1976 peaceful student revolt which later became known as the \\"first uprising\\" and was among dozens of students arrested and detained by the regime's \\"revolutionary elements\\" that had taken over the university. He, along with other detainees, was later expelled from the University for protesting against the regime. He traveled to Britain later that year to finish his education and continue his opposition to the Gaddafi regime. He resided with his younger brother Ali in Manchester where he studied Mechanical Engineering at Manchester Polytechnic (now Manchester Metropolitan University) until 1982. Establishing the Dissident Libyan Student Union (UK) In 1979 he co-founded the British branch of the dissident Libyan Student Union with the union's president Ahmad Thulthi and others. He took a leading role in student protests against Gaddafi in Britain, including editing and publishing the union's journal ‚ÄúApril Martyrs‚Äù, and organizing the first demonstration in front of the Libyan Embassy in London on 11 June 1980 in defiance of the wave of assassinations carried out by the regime's notorious ‚Äúdeath squads.‚Äù These ‚Äúsquads‚Äù were dispatched from Libya to execute Gaddafi's command to ‚Äúphysically liquidate‚Äù his opponents abroad whom he publicly labelled ‚Äústray dogs‚Äù in his televised speeches. Among the victims of that campaign in Britain alone were the BBC London journalist Mohamed Mustafa Ramadan, gunned down on 11 April 1980 outside London‚Äôs Regent Mosque as he was leaving after Friday prayer, the lawyer Mahmoud Nafa, also shot in London on 25 April 1980 and the student Ahmad Burghia, savagely knifed and mutilated in Manchester on 29 November 1980. The Libyan Constitutional Union He co-founded the political opposition organization The Libyan Constitutional Union (LCU) which was launched in Manchester on 7 October 1981 (the 30th anniversary of the promulgation of the Libyan Constitution), pledging allegiance to Libya's former ruler King Idris El-Senusi as a symbol of constitutional legitimacy. LCU Proclamation Card, 7th Oct 1981 Back of LCU Proclamation Card bearing Libya's former flag - 7th Oct 1981 The LCU raised the Libyan flag of independence (the tricolour) which Gaddafi banned as soon as he usurped power through a coup d'√©tat on 1 September 1969 and called upon fellow Libyan opposition groups in exile to fly the national flag and take the 1951 Libyan Constitution as a source of legitimacy to confront Gaddafi's illegitimate regime until the regime is toppled and the people were able to \\"decide such form of body politic and system of government as they may choose of their own free will in a referendum to be conducted under international supervision within a reasonable period following the restoration of constitutional legality to the nation\\". Ben Ghalbon, Mohamed Ben Ghalbon and Mohamed Algazeri were publicly named on the LCU's proclamation card making them one of very few opponents of Gaddafi who publicly opposed him at that time. He later became the official spokesman of the LCU. Both he and his family became immediate targets of the \\"revolutionary committee's\\" assassination teams. They had to be placed under 24-hour armed Police protection when a home he had lived in was bombed in the early hours of 11 March 1984 during the regime's wave of terrorist acts in Europe which began the previous day in London with the bombing of a kiosk that sold Libyan opposition magazines. These terrorist acts reached their deadly peak on 17 April 1984 with the murder of WPC Yvonne Fletcher with bullets fired from a window of the Libyan Embassy in London while she was on duty patrolling a peaceful protest by Libyan dissidents outside the embassy in St. James Square. Their lives returned to normality only after diplomatic relations between the UK and Libya were severed on 23 April 1984 and Gaddafi's agents left the UK. Publicising the 1996 Abu Salim prison massacre Since the beginning of May 2010 Ben Ghalbon co-organised the weekly vigils held in Manchester by political activists from the north of England in solidarity with the families of the victims of the Abu Salim prison massacre in which more than 1260 civilian detainees were murdered on 29 June 1996 in Tripoli, and to support their families demands for a fair inquest and to bring the perpetrators of that crime to justice. The vigils in Manchester were held every Saturday afternoon to coincide with the victim's families vigils in front of Benghazi's court at the same time. The massacre received close attention by international human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch and was widely publicised in their literature. February Revolution Demonstration of the Libyan Community in Britain in front of 10 Downing Street to support the February Revolution (22 Feb 2011) On the morning of 16 February 2011 Ben Ghalbon co-organised the first demonstration outside Libya to support the February Revolution that had broken out the previous night in the city of Benghazi. Libyan residents in Manchester gathered in the city's Albert Square to express their solidarity with the demonstrators in Libya and be \\"the echo of their voice\\". He also played an active role in organising the daily demonstrations in Manchester and issuing daily bulletins of the latest developments on the ground to raise public awareness in Britain and provide the media with the latest facts after the regime enforced a news blackout by blocking the internet and other lines of communications with the outside world in the early days of the uprising. He participated in organizing demonstrations in front of 10 Downing Street, the office of the British Prime Minister, in front of the embassies of countries that were still sympathetic to Gaddafi and his regime, as well as in the picketing in front of the Libyan Embassy in London until it was taken over by the pro-revolution Libyans and the flag of independence flew on its mast. He appeared regularly on Arabic and English TV channels to support the revolution and counter propaganda from the Libyan regime. In the early days of the Revolution the LCU attempted to persuade the National Transitional Council (NTC) and those in charge of post revolution Libya that the adoption of the nation's 1951 constitution was necessary to prevent a political vacuum and stop the country entering a violent distantergation that the sudden collapse of Gaddafi's rule would inevitably bring about. When this along with the LCU warning of the dangers of fragmentation of the country and civil war were ignored, Ben Ghalbon withdrew from the media and refrained from publicly commenting on the chaos that has since overwhelmed the country. He now lives and works in Manchester.

It comprises the same area as the administrative Lojsta District, established on 1January 2016. The rift valley landscape of Lojsta is unusual for Gotland and the area contains the highest point, as well as some of the deepest lakes, on the island. Sweden's only native wild ponies have their natural habitat in an animal reserve in Lojsta.  Geography  Lojsta is the name of a larger area surrounding medieval Lojsta Church, the Lojsta socken. Lojsta is north of Hemse in the middle of southern Gotland. The forested north part of the socken, the Lojsta Heath, contains the highest hills on Gotland. The highest point has an elevation of . The southern part of Lojsta has farmed land in the valleys between the limestone cliffs. In the east, the landscape is peculiar for Gotland, with high almost vertical cliffs by the Lojsta Lakes.

These ponies are the only breed of ponies native to Sweden.  Etymology  The name comes from lojst or lojstar, which means \\"flat land\\", \\"flat barren plain\\". However , it is uncertain which place it refers to.  History  Lojsta dates back to Medieval times. It was originally part of the Fardhem thing, which in turn was in the southernmost of the three original districts (similar to ridings) that Gotland was divided into during the Middle Ages. In 1862, it became an independent municipality. In 1952, it was incorporated into the Hemse municipality and in 1971, all of Gotland became one municipality. The boatswains from Lojsta under the allotment system, were part of the Second Gotlandic Boatswains Company. There are several small grave fields from the Iron Age in Lojsta as well as house foundations, collapsed stone walls and stones with grooves. Two rune inscriptions have been found by the church and one Viking silver treasure as well as a gold bracteate have also been found within the socken.
